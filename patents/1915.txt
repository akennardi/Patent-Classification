         ABSTRACT
         Methods and apparatus organize a plurality of haptic output variations into a cohesive
semantic framework that uses various information about the alert condition and trigger,
application context, and other conditions to provide a system of haptic outputs that share
characteristics between related events. In some embodiments, an event class or application
class provides the basis for a corresponding haptic output. In some embodiments, whether an
alert-salience setting is on provides the basis for adding an increased salience haptic output to
the standard haptic output for the alert. In some embodiments, consistent haptics provide for
branding of the associated application class, application, and/or context.

            SEMANTIC FRAMEWORK FOR VARIABLE HAPTIC OUTPUT
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to methods and apparatus for providing haptic
feedback, and more particularly relates to methods and apparatus for a semantic framework of
haptic feedback that corresponds to conditions associated with a device or application.
[0001A] Also incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety, is PCT/US2015/041858
(published as WO 2016/036447), filed on 23 July 2015.
BACKGROUND
[0002] Tactile feedback systems provide a user with the ability to interact with a subsystem
through touch or contact. Haptic systems facilitate these tactile interactions by using
actuators, sensors, or both.
SUMMARY
[0003] The embodiments herein disclose haptic feedback methods and apparatus that
organize a plurality of haptic output variations into a cohesive semantic framework that uses
various information about the alert condition and triggers, application context, and other
conditions to provide a system of haptic outputs that shares characteristics between related
events. This disclosure relates to systems and methods for providing haptic response in
various conditions. The disclosed haptic response approaches may be implemented using any
suitable software, hardware, or both.
[0004] In some embodiments, a state associated with an application at a time associated with
a detected alert condition associated with the application provides the basis for providing a
corresponding haptic output. For example, responsive to detecting the alert condition, a state
associated with the application at a time associated with the alert condition is determined. If
the application was in an active state at the time associated with the alert condition, a first
haptic output is provided that represents the occurrence of the alert condition and if the
application was in an inactive state at the time associated with the alert condition, a second
                                                  -1 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                           PCT/US2015/041858
haptic output is provided that represents the occurrence of the alert condition and is different
from the first haptic output.
[0005] In some embodiments, whether a detected alert condition was manually or
automatically triggered provides the basis for providing a corresponding haptic output. For
example, responsive to detecting the alert condition, whether the alert condition was triggered
by a manually-initiated event is determined. If the alert condition was triggered by a
manually-initiated event, a first haptic output is provided corresponding to a manually
initiated event notification. If the alert condition was triggered by an automatically-initiated
event, a second haptic output is provided corresponding to an automatically-initiated event
notification and is different from the first haptic output.
[0006] In some embodiments, whether a detected alert condition is associated with user
input or a predetermined system event provides the basis for providing a corresponding
haptic output. For example, responsive to detecting a first alert condition associated with
receiving user input to an application, a first haptic output is provided corresponding to the
user input. Following the first haptic output, in response to detecting a second alert condition
associated with receiving a predetermined system event in the application, a second haptic
output of a greater intensity than the first haptic output is provided corresponding to the
predetermined system event.
[0007] In some embodiments, whether a detected alert condition is part of a multi-part
operation provides the basis for providing a corresponding haptic output. For example,
responsive to receiving an input corresponding to a first part of a multi-part operation, an
ongoing haptic output sequence is initiated. After initiation and responsive to receiving an
input corresponding to a second part of the multi-part operation, the ongoing haptic output
sequence is terminated.
[0008] In some embodiments, whether a detected request to perform an operation is a subset
of another operation provides the basis for providing a corresponding haptic output. For
example, responsive to detecting a first input that corresponds to a request to perform a first
operation, a first output is provided that includes a haptic component and the first operation is
performed. After performing the first operation, and responsive to detecting a second input
that corresponds to a request to perform a second operation that includes the first operation
and a supplemental operation, a second output is provided that includes a haptic component
                                                   -2-

    WO 2016/036447                                                             PCT/US2015/041858
and includes the first output plus a supplemental output that corresponds to the supplemental
operation, and the second operation is performed.
[0009] In some embodiments, whether two detected alert conditions are in the same or
different class of alert condition or class of application provides the basis for providing a
corresponding haptic output. For example, responsive to detecting the occurrence of a first
alert condition, a first output is provided that includes a first haptic component and a first
non-haptic component. After providing the first output, and responsive to detecting the
occurrence of a second alert condition, a second output is provided that includes a second
haptic component and a second non-haptic component. If the first alert condition and the
second alert condition are different alert conditions that are in a same class of alert condition,
the first output and the second output share one or more same components and have one or
more different components, but if the first alert condition and the second alert condition are
different alert conditions that are in different classes of alert condition, the first haptic
component is different from the second haptic component and the first non-haptic component
is different from the second non-haptic component. In another example,

[0054] The embodiments herein disclose haptic feedback methods and apparatus that
organize a plurality of haptic output variations into a cohesive semantic framework that uses
various information about the alert condition and trigger, application context, and other
conditions corresponding to the haptic output to provide a system of haptic outputs that
shares characteristics between related events.
[0055] In some embodiments, a state associated with an application at a time associated with
a detected alert condition associated with the application provides the basis for providing a
corresponding haptic output. In some embodiments, whether a detected alert condition was
manually or automatically triggered provides the basis for providing a corresponding haptic

[0056] In some embodiments, whether a detected alert condition is part of a multi-part

EXEMPLARY DEVICES
[0057] Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which are
illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous
specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various
described embodiments. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that
the various described embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other
instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, circuits, and networks have not
been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments.
[0058] It will also be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. are, in some
instances, used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by
these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example,
a first contact could be termed a second contact, and, similarly, a second contact could be
termed a first contact, without departing from the scope of the various described
embodiments. The first contact and the second contact are both contacts, but they are not the
same contact.
[0059] The terminology used in the description of the various described embodiments herein
is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be
limiting. As used in the description of the various described embodiments and the appended
claims, the singular forms "a", "an" and "the" are intended to include the plural forms as well,
unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term
"and/or" as used herein refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one
or more of the associated listed items. It will be further understood that the terms "includes,"
"including," "comprises," and/or "comprising," when used in this specification, specify the
presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do
not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps,
operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.

    WO 2016/036447                                                            PCT/US2015/041858
[0060] As used herein, the term "if' is, optionally, construed to mean "when" or "upon" or "in
response to determining" or "in response to detecting," depending on the context. Similarly,
the phrase "if it is determined" or "if [a stated condition or event] is detected" is, optionally,
construed to mean "upon determining" or "in response to determining" or "upon detecting
[the stated condition or event]" or "in response to detecting [the stated condition or event],"
depending on the context.
[0061] Embodiments of electronic devices, user interfaces for such devices, and associated
processes for using such devices are described. In some embodiments, the device is a
portable communications device, such as a mobile telephone, that also contains other
functions, such as PDA and/or music player functions. Exemplary embodiments of portable
multifunction devices include, without limitation, the iPhone@, iPod Touch@, and iPad@
devices from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California. Other portable electronic devices, such as
laptops or tablet computers with touch-sensitive surfaces (e.g., touch screen displays and/or
touch pads), are, optionally, used. It should also be understood that, in some embodiments,
the device is not a portable communications device, but is a desktop computer with a touch
sensitive surface (e.g., a touch screen display and/or a touch pad).
[0062] In the discussion that follows, an electronic device that includes a display and a
touch-sensitive surface is described. It should be understood, however, that the electronic
device optionally includes one or more other physical user-interface devices, such as a
physical keyboard, a mouse and/or a joystick.
[0063] The device typically supports a variety of applications, such as one or more of the
following: a drawing application, a presentation application, a word processing application, a
website creation application, a disk authoring application, a spreadsheet application, a
gaming application, a telephone application, a video conferencing application, an e-mail
application, an instant messaging application, a workout support application, a photo
management application, a digital camera application, a digital video camera application, a
web browsing application, a digital music player application, and/or a digital video player
application.
[0064] The various applications that are executed on the device optionally use at least one
common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive surface. One or more
functions of the touch-sensitive surface as well as corresponding information displayed on
the device are, optionally, adjusted and/or varied from one application to the next and/or
                                                   -8-

    WO 2016/036447                                                           PCT/US2015/041858
within a respective application. In this way, a common physical architecture (such as the
touch-sensitive surface) of the device optionally supports the variety of applications with user
interfaces that are intuitive and transparent to the user.
[0065] Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable devices with touch
sensitive displays. Figure 1A is a block diagram illustrating portable multifunction device
100 with touch-sensitive displays 112 in accordance with some embodiments. Touch
sensitive display 112 is sometimes called a "touch screen" for convenience, and is sometimes
known as or called a touch-sensitive display system. Device 100 includes memory 102
(which optionally includes one or more computer readable storage mediums), memory
controller 122, one or more processing units (CPU's) 120, peripherals interface 118, RF
circuitry 108, audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, microphone 113, input/output (I/O)
subsystem 106, other input or control devices 116, and external port 124. Device 100
optionally includes one or more optical sensors 164. Device 100 optionally includes one or
more intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of contacts on device 100 (e.g., a touch
sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive display system 112 of device 100). Device 100
optionally includes one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating tactile outputs on
device 100 (e.g., generating tactile outputs on a touch-sensitive surface such as touch
sensitive display system 112 of device 100 or touchpad 355 of device 300). These
components optionally communicate over one or more communication buses or signal lines
103.
[0066] As used in the specification and claims, the term "intensity" of a contact on a touch
sensitive surface refers to the force or pressure (force per unit area) of a contact (e.g., a finger
contact) on the touch sensitive surface, or to a substitute (proxy) for the force or pressure of a
contact on the touch sensitive surface. The intensity of a contact has a range of values that
includes at least four distinct values and more typically includes hundreds of distinct values
(e.g., at least 256). Intensity of a contact is, optionally, determined (or measured) using
various approaches and various sensors or combinations of sensors. For example, one or
more force sensors underneath or adjacent to the touch-sensitive surface are, optionally, used
to measure force at various points on the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations,
force measurements from multiple force sensors are combined (e.g., a weighted average) to
determine an estimated force of a contact. Similarly, a pressure- sensitive tip of a stylus is,
optionally, used to determine a pressure of the stylus on the touch-sensitive surface.
                                                    -9-

    WO 2016/036447                                                              PCT/US2015/041858
Alternatively, the size of the contact area detected on the touch- sensitive surface and/or
changes thereto, the capacitance of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact
and/or changes thereto, and/or the resistance of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the
contact and/or changes thereto are, optionally, used as a substitute for the force or pressure of
the contact on the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, the substitute
measurements for contact force or pressure are used directly to determine whether an
intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is described in units
corresponding to the substitute measurements). In some implementations, the substitute
measurements for contact force or pressure are converted to an estimated force or pressure
and the estimated force or pressure is used to determine whether an intensity threshold has
been exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is a pressure threshold measured in units of
pressure). Using the intensity of a contact as an attribute of a user input allows for user
access to additional device functionality that may otherwise not be accessible by the user on a
reduced-size device with limited real estate for displaying affordances (e.g., on a touch
sensitive display) and/or receiving user input (e.g., via a touch-sensitive display, a touch
sensitive surface, or a physical/mechanical control such as a knob or a button).
[0067] As used in the specification and claims, the term "tactile output" refers to physical
displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device, physical displacement
of a component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device relative to another component
(e.g., housing) of the device, or displacement of the component relative to a center of mass of
the device that will be detected by a user with the user's sense of touch. For example, in
situations where the device or the component of the device is in contact with a surface of a
user that is sensitive to touch (e.g., a finger, palm, or other part of a user's hand), the tactile
output generated by the physical displacement will be interpreted by the user as a tactile
sensation corresponding to a perceived change in physical characteristics of the device or the
component of the device. For example, movement of a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch
sensitive display or trackpad) is, optionally, interpreted by the user as a "down click" or "up
click" of a physical actuator button. In some cases, a user will feel a tactile sensation such as
an "down click" or "up click" even when there is no movement of a physical actuator button
associated with the touch-sensitive surface that is physically pressed (e.g., displaced) by the
user's movements. As another example, movement of the touch-sensitive surface is,
optionally, interpreted or sensed by the user as "roughness" of the touch-sensitive surface,
                                                  - 10 -

even when there is no change in smoothness of the touch-sensitive surface. While such
interpretations of touch by a user will be subject to the individualized sensory perceptions of
the user, there are many sensory perceptions of touch that are common to a large majority of
users. Thus, when a tactile output is described as corresponding to a particular sensory
perception of a user (e.g., an "up click," a "down click," "roughness"), unless otherwise
stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to physical displacement of the device or a
component thereof that will generate the described sensory perception for a typical (or
average) user.
[0068] It should be appreciated that device 100 is only one example of a portable
multifunction device, and that device 100 optionally has more or fewer components than
shown, optionally combines two or more components, or optionally has a different
configuration or arrangement of the components. The various components shown in Figure
1A are implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both hardware and software,
including one or more signal processing and/or application specific integrated circuits.
[0069] Memory 102 optionally includes high-speed random access memory and optionally
also includes non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, flash
memory devices, or other non-volatile solid-state memory devices. Access to memory 102 by
other components of device 100, such as CPU 120 and the peripherals interface 118, is,
optionally, controlled by memory controller 122.
[0070] Peripherals interface 118 can be used to couple input and output peripherals of the
device to CPU 120 and memory 102. The one or more processors 120 run or execute various
software programs and/or sets of instructions stored in memory 102 to perform various
functions for device 100 and to process data.
[0071] In some embodiments, peripherals interface 118, CPU 120, and memory controller
122 are, optionally, implemented on a single chip, such as chip 104. In some embodiments,
they are, optionally, implemented on separate chips.
[0072] RF (radio frequency) circuitry 108 receives and sends RF signals, also called
electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 converts electrical signals to/from electromagnetic
signals and communicates with communications networks and other communications devices

performing these functions, including but not limited to an antenna system, an RF
transceiver, one or more amplifiers, a tuner, one or more oscillators, a digital signal

processor, a CODEC chipset, a subscriber identity module (SIM) card, memory, and so forth.
RF circuitry 108 optionally communicates with networks, such as the Internet, also referred
to as the World Wide Web (WWW), an intranet and/or a wireless network, such as a cellular
telephone network, a wireless local area network (LAN) and/or a metropolitan area network
(MAN), and other devices by wireless communication. The wireless communication
optionally uses any of a plurality of communications standards, protocols and technologies,
including but not limited to Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Enhanced
Data GSM Environment (EDGE), high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), high-speed
uplink packet access (HSUPA), Evolution, Data-Only (EV-DO), HSPA, HSPA+, Dual-Cell

802.1 1 a, IEEE 802.1 lb, IEEE 802.11 g and/or IEEE 802.1 In), Audio circuitry 110, speaker
111, and microphone 113 provide an audio interface between a user and device 100. Audio
circuitry 110 receives audio data from peripherals interface 118, converts the audio data to an
electrical signal, and transmits the electrical signal to speaker 111. Speaker 111 converts the
electrical signal to human-audible sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 also receives electrical
signals converted by microphone 113 from sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 converts the
electrical signal to audio data and transmits the audio data to peripherals interface 118 for
processing. Audio data is, optionally, retrieved from and/or transmitted to memory 102
and/or RF circuitry 108 by peripherals interface 118. In some embodiments, audio circuitry
110 also includes a headset jack (e.g., 212, Figure 2). The headset jack provides an interface
between audio circuitry 110 and removable audio input/output peripherals, such as output
only headphones or a headset with both output (e.g., a headphone for one or both ears) and
input (e.g., a microphone).
[0073] I/O subsystem 106 couples input/output peripherals on device 100, such as touch
screen 112 and other input control devices 116, to peripherals interface 118. I/O subsystem
106 optionally includes display controller 156, optical sensor controller 158, intensity sensor
controller 159, haptic feedback controller 161 and one or more input controllers 160 for other
input or control devices. The one or more input controllers 160 receive/send electrical signals

joysticks, click wheels, and so forth. In some alternate embodiments, input controller(s) 160
are, optionally, coupled to any (or none) of the following: a keyboard, infrared port, USB
port, and a pointer device such as a mouse. The one or more buttons (e.g., 208, Figure 2)
optionally include an up/down button for volume control of speaker 111 and/or microphone
 113. The one or more buttons optionally include a push button (e.g., 206, Figure 2).
 [0074] Touch-sensitive display 112 provides an input interface and an output interface
between the device and a user. Display controller 156 receives and/or sends electrical signals
from/to touch screen 112. Touch screen 112 displays visual output to the user. The visual
output optionally includes graphics, text, icons, video, and any combination thereof
(collectively termed "graphics"). In some embodiments, some or all of the visual output
corresponds to user-interface objects.
 [0075] Touch screen 112 has a touch-sensitive surface, sensor or set of sensors that accepts
input from the user based on haptic and/or tactile contact. Touch screen 112 and display
controller 156 (along with any associated modules and/or sets of instructions in memory 102)
detect contact (and any movement or breaking of the contact) on touch screen 112 and
converts the detected contact into interaction with user-interface objects (e.g., one or more
soft keys, icons, web pages or images) that are displayed on touch screen 112. In an
exemplary embodiment, a point of contact between touch screen 112 and the user
corresponds to a finger of the user.
 [0076] Touch screen 112 optionally uses LCD (liquid crystal display) technology, LPD (light
emitting polymer display) technology, or LED (light emitting diode) technology, although
other display technologies are used in some embodiments. Touch screen 112 and display
controller 156 optionally detect contact and any movement or breaking thereof using any of a
plurality of touch sensing technologies now known or later developed, including but not
limited to capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface acoustic wave technologies, as well as
other proximity sensor arrays or other elements for determining one or more points of contact
with touch screen 112. In an exemplary embodiment, projected mutual capacitance sensing
technology is used, such as that found in the iPhone@, iPod Touch@, and iPad@ from Apple
Inc. of Cupertino, California.
 [0077] Touch screen 112 optionally has a video resolution in excess of 100 dpi. In some
embodiments, the touch screen has a video resolution of approximately 160 dpi. The user
optionally makes contact with touch screen 112 using any suitable object or appendage, such
                                                 - 13 -

as a stylus, a finger, and so forth. In some embodiments, the user interface is designed to
work primarily with finger-based contacts and gestures, which can be less precise than stylus
based input due to the larger area of contact of a finger on the touch screen. In some
embodiments, the device translates the rough finger-based input into a precise pointer/cursor
position or command for performing the actions desired by the user.
[0078] In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, device 100 optionally includes
a touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular functions. In some
embodiments, the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device that, unlike the touch
screen, does not display visual output. The touchpad is, optionally, a touch-sensitive surface
that is separate from touch screen 112 or an extension of the touch-sensitive surface formed
by the touch screen.
[0079] Device 100 also includes power system 162 for powering the various components.
Power system 162 optionally includes a power management system, one or more power
sources (e.g., battery, alternating current (AC)), a recharging system, a power failure
detection circuit, a power converter or inverter, a power status indicator (e.g., a light
emitting diode (LED)) and any other components associated with the generation,
management and distribution of power in portable devices.
[0080] Device 100 optionally also includes one or more optical sensors 164. Figure 1A
shows an optical sensor coupled to optical sensor controller 158 in I/O subsystem 106.
Optical sensor 164 optionally includes charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary
metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) phototransistors. Optical sensor 164 receives light from
the environment, projected through one or more lens, and converts the light to data
representing an image. In conjunction with imaging module 143 (also called a camera
module), optical sensor 164 optionally captures still images or video. In some embodiments,
an optical sensor is located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112 on
the front of the device, so that the touch screen display is enabled for use as a viewfinder for
still and/or video image acquisition. In some embodiments, another optical sensor is located
on the front of the device so that the user's image is, optionally, obtained for
videoconferencing while the user views the other video conference participants on the touch
screen display.
[0081] Device 100 optionally also includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165. Figure
1A shows a contact intensity sensor coupled to intensity sensor controller 159 in I/O

subsystem 106. Contact intensity sensor 165 optionally includes one or more piezoresistive
strain gauges, capacitive force sensors, electric force sensors, piezoelectric force sensors,
optical force sensors, capacitive touch-sensitive surfaces, or other intensity sensors (e.g.,
sensors used to measure the force (or pressure) of a contact on a touch- sensitive surface).
Contact intensity sensor 165 receives contact intensity information (e.g., pressure information
or a proxy for pressure information) from the environment. In some embodiments, at least
one contact intensity sensor is collocated with, or proximate to, a touch-sensitive surface
(e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112). In some embodiments, at least one contact
intensity sensor is located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112
which is located on the front of device 100.
[0082] Device 100 optionally also includes one or more proximity sensors 166. Figure 1A
shows proximity sensor 166 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately, proximity
sensor 166 is coupled to input controller 160 in 1/0 subsystem 106. In some embodiments,
the proximity sensor turns off and disables touch screen 112 when the multifunction device is
placed near the user's ear (e.g., when the user is making a phone call).
[0083] Device 100 optionally also includes one or more tactile output generators 167. Figure
1A shows a tactile output generator coupled to haptic feedback controller 161 in I/O
subsystem 106. Tactile output generator 167 optionally includes one or more electroacoustic
devices such as speakers or other audio components and/or electromechanical devices that
convert energy into linear motion such as a motor, solenoid, electroactive polymer,
piezoelectric actuator, electrostatic actuator, or other tactile output generating component
(e.g., a component that converts electrical signals into tactile outputs on the device). Contact
intensity sensor 165 receives tactile feedback generation instructions from haptic feedback
module 133 and generates tactile outputs on device 100 that are capable of being sensed by a
user of device 100. In some embodiments, at least one tactile output generator is collocated
with, or proximate to, a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch- sensitive display system 112)
and, optionally, generates a tactile output by moving the touch-sensitive surface vertically
(e.g., in/out of a surface of device 100) or laterally (e.g., back and forth in the same plane as a
surface of device 100). In some embodiments, at least one tactile output generator sensor is
located on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112 which is located on the
front of device 100.

[0084] Device 100 optionally also includes one or more accelerometers 168. Figure 1A
shows accelerometer 168 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately, accelerometer
168 is, optionally, coupled to an input controller 160 in I/O subsystem 106. In some
embodiments, information is displayed on the touch screen display in a portrait view or a
landscape view based on an analysis of data received from the one or more accelerometers.
Device 100 optionally includes, in addition to accelerometer(s) 168, a magnetometer (not
shown) and a GPS (or GLONASS or other global navigation system) receiver (not shown)
for obtaining information concerning the location and orientation (e.g., portrait or landscape)
of device 100 as described in U.S. Patent Application No. 11/969,800 filed on January 4,
2008, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[0085] In some embodiments, the software components stored in memory 102 include
operating system 126, communication module (or set of instructions) 128, contact/motion
module (or set of instructions) 130, graphics module (or set of instructions) 132, text input
module (or set of instructions) 134, Global Positioning System (GPS) module (or set of
instructions) 135, and applications (or sets of instructions) 136. Furthermore, in some
embodiments memory 102 stores device/global internal state 157, as shown in Figures IA and
3. Device/global internal state 157 includes one or more of: active application state,
indicating which applications, if any, are currently active; display state, indicating what
applications, views or other information occupy various regions of touch screen display 112;
sensor state, including information obtained from the device's various sensors and input
control devices 116; and location information concerning the device's location and/or
attitude.
[0086] Operating system 126 (e.g., Darwin, RTXC, LINUX, UNIX, OS X, WINDOWS, or
an embedded operating system such as VxWorks) includes various software components
and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks (e.g., memory management,
storage device control, power management, etc.) and facilitates communication between
various hardware and software components.
[0087] Communication module 128 facilitates communication with other devices over one or
more external ports 124 and also includes various software components for handling data
received by RF circuitry 108 and/or external port 124. External port 124 (e.g., Universal
Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to other devices or
indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.). In some embodiments, the

external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as, or similar to and/or
compatible with the 30-pin connector used on iPod (trademark of Apple Inc.) devices.
[0088] Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects contact with touch screen 112 (in
conjunction with display controller 156) and other touch sensitive devices (e.g., a touchpad or
physical click wheel). Contact/motion module 130 includes various software components for
performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as determining if contact
has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining an intensity of the contact
(e.g., the force or pressure of the contact or a substitute for the force or pressure of the
contact), determining if there is movement of the contact and tracking the movement across
the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more finger-dragging events), and
determining if the contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a finger-up event or a break in contact).
Contact/motion module 130 receives contact data from the touch-sensitive surface.
Determining movement of the point of contact, which is represented by a series of contact
data, optionally includes determining speed (magnitude), velocity (magnitude and direction),
and/or an acceleration (a change in magnitude and/or direction) of the point of contact. These
operations are, optionally, applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger contacts) or to multiple
simultaneous contacts (e.g., "multitouch"/multiple finger contacts). In some embodiments,
contact/motion module 130 and display controller 156 detect contact on a touchpad.
[0089] In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 uses a set of one or more intensity
thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user (e.g., to
determine whether a user has "clicked" on an icon). In some embodiments at least a subset of
the intensity thresholds are determined in accordance with software parameters (e.g., the
intensity thresholds are not determined by the activation thresholds of particular physical
actuators and can be adjusted without changing the physical hardware of device 100). For
example, a mouse "click" threshold of a trackpad or touch screen display can be set to any of
a large range of predefined thresholds values without changing the trackpad or touch screen
display hardware. Additionally, in some implementations a user of the device is provided
with software settings for adjusting one or more of the set of intensity thresholds (e.g., by
adjusting individual intensity thresholds and/or by adjusting a plurality of intensity thresholds
at once with a system-level click "intensity" parameter).
[0090] As used in the specification and claims, the term "characteristic intensity" of a contact
refers to a characteristic of the contact based on one or more intensities of the contact. In
                                                 - 17 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                            PCT/US2015/041858
some embodiments, the characteristic intensity is based on multiple intensity samples. The
characteristic intensity is, optionally, based on a predefined number of intensity samples, or a
set of intensity samples collected during a predetermined time period (e.g., 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5,
1, 2, 5, 10 seconds) relative to a predefined event (e.g., after detecting the contact, prior to
detecting liftoff of the contact, before or after detecting a start of movement of the contact,
prior to detecting an end of the contact, before or after detecting an increase in intensity of
the contact, and/or before or after detecting a decrease in intensity of the contact). A
characteristic intensity of a contact is, optionally based on one or more of: a maximum value
of the intensities of the contact, a mean value of the intensities of the contact, an average
value of the intensities of the contact, a top 10 percentile value of the intensities of the
contact, a value at the half maximum of the intensities of the contact, a value at the 90
percent maximum of the intensities of the contact, or the like. In some embodiments, the
duration of the contact is used in determining the characteristic intensity (e.g., when the
characteristic intensity is an average of the intensity of the contact over time). In some
embodiments, the characteristic intensity is compared to a set of one or more intensity
thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user. For example, the
set of one or more intensity thresholds may include a first intensity threshold and a second
intensity threshold. In this example, a contact with a characteristic intensity that does not
exceed the first threshold results in a first operation, a contact with a characteristic intensity
that exceeds the first intensity threshold and does not exceed the second intensity threshold
results in a second operation, and a contact with a characteristic intensity that exceeds the
third threshold results in a third operation. In some embodiments, a comparison between the
characteristic intensity and one or more thresholds is used to determine whether or not to
perform one or more operations (e.g., whether to perform a respective option or forgo
performing the respective operation) rather than being used to determine whether to perform
a first operation or a second operation. .
[0091] In some embodiments, a portion of a gesture is identified for purposes of determining
a characteristic intensity. For example, a touch-sensitive surface may receive a continuous
swipe contact transitioning from a start location and reaching an end location, at which point
the intensity of the contact increases. In this example, the characteristic intensity of the
contact at the end location may be based on only a portion of the continuous swipe contact,
and not the entire swipe contact (e.g., only the portion of the swipe contact at the end
                                                  - 18 -

location). In some embodiments, a smoothing algorithm may be applied to the intensities of
the swipe contact prior to determining the characteristic intensity of the contact. For
example, the smoothing algorithm optionally includes one or more of: an unweighted sliding
average smoothing algorithm, a triangular smoothing algorithm, a median filter smoothing
algorithm, and/or an exponential smoothing algorithm. In some circumstances, these
smoothing algorithms eliminate narrow spikes or dips in the intensities of the swipe contact
for purposes of determining a characteristic intensity.
[0092] Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects a gesture input by a user. Different
gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns (e.g., different motions,
timings, and/or intensities of detected contacts). Thus, a gesture is, optionally, detected by
detecting a particular contact pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap gesture includes
detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off) event at the same
position (or substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g., at the position of
an icon). As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the touch-sensitive surface
includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or more finger-dragging
events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off) event.
[0093] Graphics module 132 includes various known software components for rendering and
displaying graphics on touch screen 112 or other display, including components for changing
the visual impact (e.g., brightness, transparency, saturation, contrast or other visual property)
of graphics that are displayed. As used herein, the term "graphics" includes any object that
can be displayed to a user, including without limitation text, web pages, icons (such as user
interface objects including soft keys), digital images, videos, animations and the like.
[0094] In some embodiments, graphics module 132 stores data representing graphics to be
used. Each graphic is, optionally, assigned a corresponding code. Graphics module 132
receives, from applications etc., one or more codes specifying graphics to be displayed along
with, if necessary, coordinate data and other graphic property data, and then generates screen
image data to output to display controller 156.
[0095] Haptic feedback module 133 includes various software components for generating
instructions used by tactile output generator(s) 167 to produce tactile outputs at one or more
locations on device 100 in response to user interactions with device 100.

for use in various applications (e.g., to telephone 138 for use in location-based dialing, to
camera 143 as picture/video metadata, and to applications that provide location- based
services such as weather widgets, local yellow page widgets, and map/navigation widgets).

[0119]      Each of the above identified modules and applications correspond to a set of
executable instructions for performing one or more functions described above and the
methods described in this application (e.g., the computer-implemented methods and other
information processing methods described herein). These modules (i.e., sets of instructions)
need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus
various subsets of these modules are, optionally, combined or otherwise re-arranged in
various embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102 optionally stores a subset of the
modules and data structures identified above. Furthermore, memory 102 optionally stores
additional modules and data structures not described above.
[0120]      In some embodiments, device 100 is a device where operation of a predefined set
of functions on the device is performed exclusively through a touch screen and/or a touchpad.
By using a touch screen and/or a touchpad as the primary input control device for operation
of device 100, the number of physical input control devices (such as push buttons, dials, and
the like) on device 100 is, optionally, reduced.
[0121]      The predefined set of functions that are performed exclusively through a touch
screen and/or a touchpad optionally include navigation between user interfaces. In some
embodiments, the touchpad, when touched by the user, navigates device 100 to a main, home,
or root menu from any user interface that is displayed on device 100. In such embodiments, a
"menu button" is implemented using a touchpad. In some embodiments, the menu button is a
physical push button or other physical input control device instead of a touchpad.
[0122]      Figure lB is a block diagram illustrating exemplary components for event
handling in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102 (in
Figures IA) or 370 (Figure 3) includes event sorter 170 (e.g., in operating system 126) and a
respective application 136-1 (e.g., any of the aforementioned applications 137-13, 155, 380
390).
[0123]      Event sorter 170 receives event information and determines the application 136-1
and application view 191 of application 136-1 to which to deliver the event information.
Event sorter 170 includes event monitor 171 and event dispatcher module 174. In some
                                                - 25 -

embodiments, application 136-1 includes application internal state 192, which indicates the
current application view(s) displayed on touch sensitive display 112 when the application is
active or executing. In some embodiments, device/global internal state 157 is used by event
sorter 170 to determine which application(s) is (are) currently active, and application internal
state 192 is used by event sorter 170 to determine application views 191 to which to deliver
event information.
[0124]       In some embodiments, application internal state 192 includes additional
information, such as one or more of: resume information to be used when application 136-1
resumes execution, user interface state information that indicates information being displayed
or that is ready for display by application 136-1, a state queue for enabling the user to go
back to a prior state or view of application 136-1, and a redo/undo queue of previous actions
taken by the user.
[0125]       Event monitor 171 receives event information from peripherals interface 118.
Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on touch
sensitive display 112, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface 118 transmits
information it receives from I/O subsystem 106 or a sensor, such as proximity sensor 166,
accelerometer(s) 168, and/or microphone 113 (through audio circuitry 110). Information that
peripherals interface 118 receives from I/O subsystem 106 includes information from touch
sensitive display 112 or a touch-sensitive surface.
[0126]       In some embodiments, event monitor 171 sends requests to the peripherals
interface 118 at predetermined intervals. In response, peripherals interface 118 transmits
event information. In embodiments, peripheral interface 118 transmits event information
only when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving an input above a predetermined noise
threshold and/or for more than a predetermined duration).
[0127]       In some embodiments, event sorter 170 also includes a hit view determination
module 172 and/or an active event recognizer determination module 173.
[0128]       Hit view determination module 172 provides software procedures for determining
where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views, when touch sensitive display
112 displays more than one view. Views are made up of controls and other elements that a
user can see on the display.
[0129]       Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set of
views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which
                                                - 26 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                           PCT/US2015/041858
information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a
respective application) in which a touch is detected optionally correspond to programmatic
levels within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application. For example, the lowest
level view in which a touch is detected is, optionally, called the hit view, and the set of events
that are recognized as proper inputs are, optionally, determined based, at least in part, on the
hit view of the initial touch that begins a touch-based gesture.
[0130]      Hit view determination module 172 receives information related to sub- events of
a touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized in a hierarchy, hit
view determination module 172 identifies a hit view as the lowest view in the hierarchy
which should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view is the lowest level
view in which an initiating sub-event occurs (i.e., the first sub-event in the sequence of sub
events that form an event or potential event). Once the hit view is identified by the hit view
determination module, the hit view typically receives all sub-events related to the same touch
or input source for which it was identified as the hit view.
[0131]      Active event recognizer determination module 173 determines which view or
views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In some
embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that only the hit
view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In some embodiments, active event
recognizer determination module 173 determines that all views that include the physical
location of a sub-event are actively involved views, and therefore determines that all actively
involved views should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In some embodiments,
even if touch sub-events were entirely confined to the area associated with one particular
view, views higher in the hierarchy would still remain as actively involved views.
[0132]      Event dispatcher module 174 dispatches the event information to an event
recognizer (e.g., event recognizer 180). In embodiments including active event recognizer
determination module 173, event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to an
event recognizer determined by active event recognizer determination module 173. In some
embodiments, event dispatcher module 174 stores in an event queue the event information,
which is retrieved by a respective event receiver module 182.
[0133]      In some embodiments, operating system 126 includes event sorter 170.
Alternatively, application 136-1 includes event sorter 170. However, in some embodiments,

event sorter 170 is a stand-alone module, or a part of another module stored in memory 102,
such as contact/motion module 130.
[0134]      In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes a plurality of event handlers
190 and one or more application views 191, each of which includes instructions for handling
touch events that occur within a respective view of the application's user interface. Each
application view 191 of the application 136-1 includes one or more event recognizers 180.
Typically, a respective application view 191 includes a plurality of event recognizers 180. In
some embodiments, one or more of event recognizers 180 are part of a separate module, such
as a user interface kit (not shown) or a higher level object from which application 136-1
inherits methods and other properties. In some embodiments, a respective event handler 190
includes one or more of: data updater 176, object updater 177, GUI updater 178, and/or event
data 179 received from event sorter 170. Event handler 190 optionally utilizes or calls data
updater 176, object updater 177 or GUI updater 178 to update the application internal state
192. Alternatively, one or more of the application views 191 includes one or more respective
event handlers 190. Also, in some embodiments, one or more of data updater 176, object
updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a respective application view 191.
[0135]      A respective event recognizer 180 receives event information (e.g., event data
179) from event sorter 170, and identifies an event from the event information. Event
recognizer 180 includes event receiver 182 and event comparator 184. In some embodiments,
event recognizer 180 also includes at least a subset of: metadata 183, and event delivery
instructions 188 (which optionally include sub-event delivery instructions).
[0136]      Event receiver 182 receives event information from event sorter 170. The event
information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch
movement. Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional
information, such as location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a
touch, the event information optionally also includes speed and direction of the sub-event. In
some embodiments, events include rotation of the device from one orientation to another
(e.g., from a portrait orientation to a landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the event
information includes corresponding information about the current orientation (also called
device attitude) of the device.
[0137]      Event comparator 184 compares the event information to predefined event or sub
event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event, or
                                                 -28-

determines or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event
comparator 184 includes event definitions 186. Event definitions 186 contain definitions of
events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event 1 (187-1), event 2 (187
2), and others. In some embodiments, sub-events in an event 187 include, for example, touch
begin, touch end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple touching. In one
example, the definition for event 1 (187-1) is a double tap on a displayed object. The double
tap, for example, comprises a first touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a
predetermined phase, a first lift-off (touch end) for a predetermined phase, a second touch
(touch begin) on the displayed object for a predetermined phase, and a second lift-off (touch
end) for a predetermined phase. In another example, the definition for event 2 (187-2) is a
dragging on a displayed object. The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or contact) on
the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a movement of the touch across touch
sensitive display 112, and lift-off of the touch (touch end). In some embodiments, the event
also includes information for one or more associated event handlers 190.
[0138]      In some embodiments, event definition 187 includes a definition of an event for a
respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator 184 performs a hit
test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event. For example, in
an application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on touch-sensitive
display 112, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display 112, event comparator 184
performs a hit test to determine which of the three user-interface objects is associated with
the touch (sub-event). If each displayed object is associated with a respective event handler
190, the event comparator uses the result of the hit test to determine which event handler 190
should be activated. For example, event comparator 184 selects an event handler associated
with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit test.
[0139]      In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event 187 also includes
delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been determined
whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event recognizer's
event type.
[0140]      When a respective event recognizer 180 determines that the series of sub- events
do not match any of the events in event definitions 186, the respective event recognizer 180
enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which it disregards
subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other event recognizers, if
                                                 - 29 -

any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process sub- events of an
ongoing touch-based gesture.
[0141]       In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 includes metadata 183
with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event delivery system
should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers. In some
embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate
how event recognizers interact, or are enabled to interact, with one another. In some
embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate
whether sub-events are delivered to varying levels in the view or programmatic hierarchy.
[0142]       In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 activates event handler
190 associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event are
recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 delivers event
information associated with the event to event handler 190. Activating an event handler 190
is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In some
embodiments, event recognizer 180 throws a flag associated with the recognized event, and
event handler 190 associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a predefined process.
[0143]       In some embodiments, event delivery instructions 188 include sub-event delivery
instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating an event
handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to event
handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views. Event
handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views receive the
event information and perform a predetermined process.
[0144]       In some embodiments, data updater 176 creates and updates data used in
application 136-1. For example, data updater 176 updates the telephone number used in
contacts module 137, or stores a video file used in video player module 145. In some
embodiments, object updater 177 creates and updates objects used in application 136-1. For
example, object updater 176 creates a new user-interface object or updates the position of a
user-interface object. GUI updater 178 updates the GUI. For example, GUI updater 178
prepares display information and sends it to graphics module 132 for display on a touch
sensitive display.
[0145]       In some embodiments, event handler(s) 190 includes or has access to data updater
176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178. In some embodiments, data updater 176,

object updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a single module of a respective
application 136-1 or application view 191. In some embodiments, they are included in two or
more software modules.
[0146]       It shall be understood that the foregoing discussion regarding event handling of
user touches on touch-sensitive displays also applies to other forms of user inputs to operate
multifunction devices 100 with input-devices, not all of which are initiated on touch screens.
For example, mouse movement and mouse button presses, optionally coordinated with single
or multiple keyboard presses or holds; contact movements such as taps, drags, scrolls, etc., on
touch-pads; pen stylus inputs; movement of the device; oral instructions; detected eye
movements; biometric inputs; and/or any combination thereof are optionally utilized as
inputs corresponding to sub-events which define an event to be recognized.
[0147]       Figure 2 illustrates a portable multifunction device 100 having a touch screen 112
in accordance with some embodiments. The touch screen optionally displays one or more
graphics within user interface (UI) 200. In this embodiment, as well as others described
below, a user is enabled to select one or more of the graphics by making a gesture on the
graphics, for example, with one or more fingers 202 (not drawn to scale in the figure) or one
or more styluses 203 (not drawn to scale in the figure). In some embodiments, selection of
one or more graphics occurs when the user breaks contact with the one or more graphics. In
some embodiments, the gesture optionally includes one or more taps, one or more swipes
(from left to right, right to left, upward and/or downward) and/or a rolling of a finger (from
right to left, left to right, upward and/or downward) that has made contact with device 100. In
some implementations or circumstances, inadvertent contact with a graphic does not select
the graphic. For example, a swipe gesture that sweeps over an application icon optionally
does not select the corresponding application when the gesture corresponding to selection is a
tap.
[0148]       Device 100 optionally also includes one or more physical buttons, such as "home"
or menu button 204. As described previously, menu button 204 is, optionally, used to
navigate to any application 136 in a set of applications that are, optionally executed on device
100. In some embodiments, the menu button 204 includes a fingerprint sensor that identifies
a fingerprint on the menu button 204. The fingerprint sensor is optionally used to determine
whether a finger on the menu button 204 has a fingerprint that matches a fingerprint used to
                                                 -31 -

as a soft key in a GUI displayed on touch screen 112.
[0149]       In one embodiment, device 100 includes touch screen 112, menu button 204, push
button 206 for powering the device on/off and locking the device, volume adjustment
button(s) 208, Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card slot 210, head set jack 2 12, and
docking/charging external port 124. Push button 206 is, optionally, used to tum the power
on/off on the device by depressing the button and holding the button in the depressed state for
a predefined time interval; to lock the device by depressing the button and releasing the
button before the predefined time interval has elapsed; and/or to unlock the device or initiate
an unlock process. In an alternative embodiment, device 100 also accepts verbal input for
activation or deactivation of some functions through microphone 113. Device 100 also,
optionally, includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165 for detecting intensity of
contacts on touch screen 112 and/or one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating
tactile outputs for a user of device 100.
[0150]       Figure 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary multifunction device with a display
and a touch-sensitive surface in accordance with some embodiments. Device 300 need not be
portable. In some embodiments, device 300 is a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a
tablet computer, a multimedia player device, a navigation device, an educational device (such
as a child's learning toy), a gaming system, or a control device (e.g., a home or industrial
controller). Device 300 typically includes one or more processing units (CPU's) 310, one or
more network or other communications interfaces 360, memory 370, and one or more
communication buses 320 for interconnecting these components. Communication buses 320
optionally include circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls
communications between system components. Device 300 includes input/output (1/0)
interface 330 comprising display 340, which is typically a touch screen display. I/O interface
330 also optionally includes a keyboard and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 350 and
touchpad 355, tactile output generator 357 for generating tactile outputs on device 300 (e.g.,
similar to tactile output generator(s) 167 described above with reference to Figure 1A),
sensors 359 (e.g., optical, acceleration, proximity, touch-sensitive, and/or contact intensity
sensors similar to contact intensity sensor(s) 165 described above with reference to Figure
IA). Memory 370 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR
RAM or other random access solid state memory devices; and optionally includes non
                                                - 32 -

volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices, optical disk storage
devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid state storage devices. Memory 370
optionally includes one or more storage devices remotely located from CPU(s) 310. In some
embodiments, memory 370 stores programs, modules, and data structures analogous to the
programs, modules, and data structures stored in memory 102 of portable multifunction
device 100 (Figure 1A), or a subset thereof. Furthermore, memory 370 optionally stores
additional programs, modules, and data structures not present in memory 102 of portable
multifunction device 100. For example, memory 370 of device 300 optionally stores drawing
module 380, presentation module 382, word processing module 384, website creation
module 386, disk authoring module 388, and/or spreadsheet module 390, while memory 102
of portable multifunction device 100 (Figure 1A) optionally does not store these modules.
[0151]      Each of the above identified elements in Figure 3 are, optionally, stored in one or
more of the previously mentioned memory devices. Each of the above identified modules
corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function described above. The above
identified modules or programs (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented as
separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various subsets of these
modules are, optionally, combined or otherwise re-arranged in various embodiments. In some
embodiments, memory 370 optionally stores a subset of the modules and data structures
identified above. Furthermore, memory 370 optionally stores additional modules and data
structures not described above.
[0152]      Attention is now directed towards embodiments of user interfaces ("UI") that is,
optionally, implemented on portable multifunction device 100.
[0153]      Figure 4A illustrates an exemplary user interface for a menu of applications on
portable multifunction device 100 in accordance with some embodiments. Similar user
interfaces are, optionally, implemented on device 300. In some embodiments, user interface
400 includes the following elements, or a subset or superset thereof:
[0154]      Signal strength indicator(s) 402 for wireless communication(s), such as cellular
and Wi-Fi signals; Time 404; Bluetooth indicator 405; Battery status indicator 406; Tray
408 with icons for frequently used applications, such as: Icon 416 for telephone module
138, labeled "Phone," which optionally includes an indicator 414 of the number of missed
calls or voicemail messages; Icon 418 for e-mail client module 140, labeled "Mail," which
optionally includes an indicator 410 of the number of unread e-mails; Icon 420 for browser
                                                - 33 -

module 147, labeled "Browser;" and Icon 422 for video and music player module 152, also
referred to as iPod (trademark of Apple Inc.) module 152, labeled "iPod;" and Icons for other
applications, such as: Icon 424 for IM module 141, labeled "Text;" Icon 426 for calendar
module 148, labeled "Calendar;" Icon 428 for image management module 144, labeled
"Photos;" Icon 430 for camera module 143, labeled "Camera;" Icon 432 for online video
module 155, labeled "Online Video"; Icon 434 for stocks widget 149-2, labeled "Stocks;"
Icon 436 for map module 154, labeled "Map;" Icon 438 for weather widget 149-1, labeled
"Weather;" Icon 440 for alarm clock widget 149-4, labeled "Clock;" Icon 442 for workout
support module 142, labeled "Workout Support;" Icon 444 for notes module 153, labeled
"Notes;" and Icon 446 for a settings application or module, which provides access to settings
for device 100 and its various applications 136.
[0155]      It should be noted that the icon labels illustrated in Figure 4A are merely
exemplary. For example, icon 422 for video and music player module 152 is labeled "Music"
or "Music Player." Other labels are, optionally, used for various application icons. In some
embodiments, a label for a respective application icon includes a name of an application
corresponding to the respective application icon. In some embodiments, a label for a
particular application icon is distinct from a name of an application corresponding to the
particular application icon.
[0156]      Figure 4B illustrates an exemplary user interface on a device (e.g., device 300,
Figure 3) with a touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a tablet or touchpad 355, Figure 3) that is
separate from the display 450 (e.g., touch screen display 112). Device 300 also, optionally,
includes one or more contact intensity sensors (e.g., one or more of sensors 357) for detecting
intensity of contacts on touch-sensitive surface 451 and/or one or more tactile output
generators 359 for generating tactile outputs for a user of device 300.
[0157]      Although some of the examples which follow will be given with reference to
inputs on touch screen display 112 (where the touch sensitive surface and the display are
combined), in some embodiments, the device detects inputs on a touch-sensitive surface that
is separate from the display, as shown in Figure 4B. In some embodiments the touch sensitive
surface (e.g., 451 in Figure 4B) has a primary axis (e.g., 452 in Figure 4B) that corresponds
to a primary axis (e.g., 453 in Figure 4B) on the display (e.g., 450). In accordance with some
embodiments, the device detects contacts (e.g., 460 and 462 in Figure 4B) with the touch
sensitive surface 451 at locations that correspond to respective locations on the display (e.g.,
                                                - 34  -

    WO 2016/036447                                                            PCT/US2015/041858
in Figure 4B, 460 corresponds to 468 and 462 corresponds to 470). In this way, user inputs
(e.g., contacts 460 and 462, and movements thereof) detected by the device on the touch
sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in Figure 4B) are used by the device to manipulate the user
interface on the display (e.g., 450 in Figure 4B) of the multifunction device when the touch
sensitive surface is separate from the display. It should be understood that similar methods
are, optionally, used for other user interfaces described herein.
[0158]      Additionally, while the following examples are given primarily with reference to
finger inputs (e.g., finger contacts, finger tap gestures, finger swipe gestures), it should be
understood that, in some embodiments, one or more of the finger inputs are replaced with
input from another input device (e.g., a mouse based input or stylus input). For example, a
swipe gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click (e.g., instead of a contact) followed
by movement of the cursor along the path of the swipe (e.g., instead of movement of the
contact). As another example, a tap gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click while
the cursor is located over the location of the tap gesture (e.g., instead of detection of the
contact followed by ceasing to detect the contact). Similarly, when multiple user inputs are
simultaneously detected, it should be understood that multiple computer mice are, optionally,
used simultaneously, or a mouse and finger contacts are, optionally, used simultaneously.
[0159]      As used herein, the term "focus selector" refers to an input element that indicates a
current part of a user interface with which a user is interacting. In some implementations that
include a cursor or other location marker, the cursor acts as a "focus selector," so that when
an input (e.g., a press input) is detected on a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touchpad 355 in
Figure 3 or touch-sensitive surface 451 in Figure 4B) while the cursor is over a particular
user interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider or other user interface element), the
particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some
implementations that include a touch-screen display (e.g., touch- sensitive display system 112
in Figure 1A or touch screen 112 in Figure 4A) that enables direct interaction with user
interface elements on the touch-screen display, a detected contact on the touch-screen acts as
a "focus selector," so that when an input (e.g., a press input by the contact) is detected on the
touch-screen display at a location of a particular user interface element (e.g., a button,
window, slider or other user interface element), the particular user interface element is
adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some implementations focus is moved
from one region of a user interface to another region of the user interface without
                                                  - 35 -

corresponding movement of a cursor or movement of a contact on a touch-screen display
(e.g., by using a tab key or arrow keys to move focus from one button to another button); in
these implementations, the focus selector moves in accordance with movement of focus
between different regions of the user interface. Without regard to the specific form taken by
the focus selector, the focus selector is generally the user interface element (or contact on a
touch-screen display) that is controlled by the user so as to communicate the user's intended
interaction with the user interface (e.g., by indicating, to the device, the element of the user
interface with which the user is intending to interact). For example, the location of a focus
selector (e.g., a cursor, a contact or a selection box) over a respective button while a press
input is detected on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touchpad or touch screen) will indicate
that the user is intending to activate the respective button (as opposed to other user interface
elements shown on a display of the device).
                    HAPTIC OUTPUT AND ASSOCIATED PROCESSES
[0160]      Attention is now directed towards embodiments of haptic output and associated
processes that may be implemented on an electronic device, such as device 300 or portable
multifunction device 100. Although the description below is with respect to device 100, the
embodiments herein can be incorporated in device 300.
[0161]      Figure 5 depicts examples of various haptic waveform morphologies according to
some embodiments. The various haptic types serve as atomic haptic components that are
used in various combinations to create various haptic waveforms having distinctive
meanings. The examples below are described to establish a vocabulary for distinguishing
between haptic output types herein. The haptic output types described herein are not meant
to be exhaustive; other haptic waveforms can be used.
[0162]      Waveforms 505 represent examples haptic waveforms with relatively large
amplitudes, or "tap" type haptic outputs, according to some embodiments, that are readily
perceptible (e.g., significantly above the absolute threshold of touch perceptibility for a given
haptic device) by users of a device outputting the haptic, even if just a singular tap. As seen
by the various tap haptic outputs 505a-e, the waveforms vary in amplitude, duration, and
frequency. Typically, humans can perceive frequencies from 5Hz to 29Hz, and amplitudes of
ON to 1.ON (sones; equivalent to ~0-40 dBA), depending on kHz. Human hearing of audible
amplitudes is the most sensitive at 1-4 kHz.

    WO 2016/036447                                                          PCT/US2015/041858
[0163]       Waveforms 510 represent examples of haptic waveforms with relatively smaller
amplitudes (and, optionally, shorter durations) as compared to waveforms 505, or "microtap"
type haptic outputs, according to some embodiments, which are less readily perceptible (e.g.,
near the low threshold of touch perceptibility for a given haptic device) for users of a device
outputting the haptic to detect as a singular microtap, but are easily perceptible if multiple
microtaps are output in succession. The microtap waveforms 51 Ga-c also vary in amplitude,
duration, and frequency.
[0164]       Waveform 515 represents an example combination haptic of a tap followed by
two microtaps. Since microtaps less easily perceptible alone, waveforms that have a tap
preceding a microtap can "prime" the user by getting his or her attention with tap, making the
user more readily perceive the microtap.
[0165]       Waveforms 520 represent examples of "fade" type waveforms, which have waves
for a longer duration that decrease in amplitude over time. Waveform 520a is a "tap-fade"
starting at a greater, tap-level amplitude, and ending in a microtap-level amplitude, and
waveform 520b is a microtap-fade, starting at a lesser, microtap-level amplitude and ending
at a lower amplitude.
[0166]       Waveform 525 represents an example a "buzz" type waveform which is
continuous high frequency typically lasting for a longer duration overall (e.g., 0.5s to Is). A
buzz can have a higher or lower amplitude according to various embodiments, and is
perceptible to the user as a consistent vibration.
[0167]       Various audio waveforms optionally are output synchronously to various haptic
waveforms, so as to correspond in the audio domain to the frequency, amplitude and duration
characteristics of the haptic outputs or to differentiate therefrom. Various atomic haptic
components, such as those described above, are used in various combinations to create
various haptic waveforms that correspond to audio waveforms. The atomic haptic
components are modulated with different parameters (e.g., amplitudes, count/repetition,
timing offsets) to generate different audio patterns directly from the haptic device itself, so
that the audio waveform corresponds to the haptic waveform. In addition, some waveforms
produced by haptic actuators (e.g., tactile output generator(s) 167) produce audible output of
machine-like sounds such as "ticking" according to some embodiments.          Alternatively, in
some embodiments, a separate audio signal generator and output device (e.g., a tone
                                                 - 37 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                          PCT/US2015/041858
generator and speaker) can be used to synchronously output audio waveforms that have
differentiated waveforms from the haptic waveforms.
[0168]      Figure 6 depicts examples of various audio waveform morphologies according to
some embodiments. Waveforms 605 represent examples of audio waveforms of various
amplitude, duration, and frequency. Sometimes specialized waveforms are created to mimic
common sounds that correlate with the activity the audio is to be paired with. Waveforms
610 are examples of specialized waveforms. Waveform 61 Ga is a waveform that mimics a
walkie-talkie sound, and waveform 610b is a waveform that mimics a heartbeat sound.
[0169]      In some embodiments, when haptic and audio waveforms have corresponding
morphologies, e.g., if the haptic waveform and the audio waveform have peaks at similar
times and of similar durations such that the two waveforms look similar to each other, they
are output synchronously. Waveforms 615 (haptic; dashed line) and 620 (audio; solid line)
are shown separately, and then aligned and synchronized in time. In this example, the time
alignment synchronizes a haptic waveform with a series of taps with a heartbeat-sounding
audio waveform, to create a join sounds and feel of a heartbeat, e.g., for use in conjunction
with a heartbeat monitor.
[0170]      In some embodiments, the audio components share attributes, but still differ, e.g.,
a same ringtone or musical notes (same amplitude, frequency, and duration) played in
different pitches or with using different musical instruments are used. Overlaying different
audio (e.g., high vs. low pitch, same audio played in metallic vs. glass vs. ceramic tones, etc.)
on the same haptic output creates different semantic components. These examples are not
meant to be exhaustive; other audio waveforms can be used.
[0171]      For example, a respective haptic output may be accompanied by a corresponding
audio output, with at least a portion of the respective audio output concurrent with at least a
portion of the respective haptic output, or the respective audio output occurs close in time to
the respective haptic output so that the respective haptic output and the respective audio
output are perceptually concurrent or simultaneous. The haptic and audio waveforms need
not be perfectly aligned, and the device can take into account the fact that for certain classes
of haptic and audio outputs, the haptic and audio outputs will be perceived by a user to be
concurrent or simultaneous even if they are slightly offset in time (e.g., because audio output
is processed more quickly than haptic output, so providing haptic output before providing
audio output will, in some circumstance, cause a user to perceive the audio and haptic output
                                                 - 38 -

as occurring concurrently or simultaneously). Variations in the accompanying audio portion
also can vary between embodiments that include an audio output. For example, each of an
amplitude of an audio component associated with the first output, a duration of the audio
component associated with the first output, one or more musical qualities (e.g., pitch, tone,
etc.) associated with the audio component associated with the first output, can vary in certain
circumstances.
Application State-based Haptic Output
[0172]      One or more states associated with an application at a time associated with a
detected alert condition for the application provides the basis for providing a corresponding
haptic output, according to some embodiments. Providing haptic output that correlates with
the state of an application creates a more efficient human-machine interface, thereby reducing
the amount of time it takes for a user to perform operations, which consequently reduces
energy use and increases battery life for battery powered devices. Figure 7 is a flow diagram
of a method 700 for detecting an alert condition associated with an application and providing
a corresponding haptic output according to some embodiments. Note that in some
embodiments, different steps may be performed other than those shown in Figure 7.
[0173]      The method begins by a device 100 detecting 705 an alert condition associated
with an application executing on a computing device 100 according to some embodiments.
For an application executing on the computing device 100, the alert condition takes various
form according to various embodiments. An alert condition is any event, notification, or
other alert directed to a user of the device. One type of alert condition corresponds to an
event that is automatically triggered by the application, or triggered from within the
application. For example, an alert condition triggered by an application includes
predetermined or scheduled alerts, such as reminders, scheduled notifications, or alarms
generated by the application. A second type of alert condition is an automatically initiated
event notification that is received by the application from a source external to the device. For
example, a system generated email or message, such as a mass email, spam, system
generated email directed to a mailing list, or any other system generated communication. A
third type of alert condition is a manually-initiated event notification, received by the
application from a human user other than the user operating the device. For example, an
incoming message or call from a known email address or phone number on the user's contact
list.   Various alert conditions can be detected, e.g., detecting receipt of an email or text
                                                 - 39 -

message while a user interface of an email or messaging application is displayed on the
display of the device.
[0174]       Responsive to the alert condition, the device 100 determines 710 a state associated
with the application at a time associated with the alert condition, according to some
embodiments. In one example, the time associated with the alert condition is the time the
alert is received. In a second example, the time associated with the alert condition is the time
the alert is detected.
[0175]       In some embodiments, determining 710 the state associated with the application at
the time associated with the alert condition comprises determining whether a user interface
for the application was displayed on the device at or around the time of the alert condition.
In some circumstances it is the time of the alert condition, and in other circumstances the
time period at issue includes a specified time interval surrounding the time associated with
the alert condition, for example during a predefined time window spanning an interval before
and/or after the time associated with the alert condition.
[0176]       According to some embodiments, the state can be determined 710 by based on
whether the application was executing on the computing device at the time associated with
the alert condition, with a determination that the application was in the active state based on
the application executing in the foreground. For example, a user interface element visible on
the display of the device while the application is executing. In this case, a determination that
the application was in the inactive state based on the application not executing on the
computing device or executing in the background. For example, the device was not actively
in use, or not performing calculations at the direction of the application, or not displaying a
user interface element indicating an active state of the application. A combination of both the
status of the user interface display and the activity state of the application optionally is used
in the determination 710.
[0177]       Referring to Figure 8, there is shown an example of an email application 800 that
is actively executing in the foreground on the device 100 and for which the user interface is
visible, according to some embodiments. In this example, the email application 800 is in the
active state. Conversely, an example of an inactive email application on device 100 is shown
in Figure 4A, in which the email application 800 either is not executing or is executing in the
background, since it is not visible on the device 100.

    WO 2016/036447                                                          PCT/US2015/041858
[0178]      Referring again to Figure 7, in this example, the state associated with the
application at the time associated with the alert condition is determined 710 based on whether
the respective user interface window corresponding to the application was displayed in the
foreground of the multi-application-window user interface at the time associated with the
alert condition. For example, if multiple application windows are displayed in a stack, the
application in the front most position in the z-layer is considered the active application. As
known in the art, the respective user interface window is the application window that is
receptive to, and/or configured to receive, user input or user interaction, sometimes referred
to as the window that has focus.
[0179]      According to some embodiments, one or more other user interface windows are
concurrently displayed on a multi-application-window user interface on the device at the time
associated with the alert condition, in which case determining 710 the state associated with
the application at the time associated with the alert condition comprises determining whether
a respective user interface window corresponding to the application was displayed in the
multi-application-window user interface at the time associated with the alert condition.
[0180]      According to some embodiments, another way of determining 710 the state
associated with the application at the time associated with the alert condition comprises
determining whether user input to the application was detected at the time associated with the
alert condition, with the user interaction being different from the alert condition. For
example, user input in various circumstances includes user touch input, speech input, or
visual /gaze-based input, or any means of receiving user input to the application. The time
associated with the alert in some cases is the time of the alert condition, and in other
circumstances includes a specified time interval surrounding the time associated with the
alert condition, for example during a predefined time window spanning an interval before
and/or after the time associated with the alert condition.
[0181]      In some embodiments in which it is determined 710 that the application was in the
active state based on a detected user interaction at the time associated with the alert
condition, the device 100 further determines a level of user engagement associated with the
user interaction at the time associated with the alert condition. User engagement in some
circumstances is a spectrum of possible user interactions with the application ranging from a
lowest level of engagement such as eye gaze alone, through medium levels of engagement
such as voice or touch alone, up to a greater level of engagement such as touch, voice, and
                                                - 41 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                              PCT/US2015/041858
eye gaze combined to focus on the application (e.g., either current level of engagement,
historical level of engagement over a predetermined time period, or a combination of the
two).
[0182]       Determining 710 the state associated with the application at a time associated with
the alert condition comprises, in some embodiments, determining a state of the computing
device at the time associated with the alert condition. In this example, determining that the
application was in the active state comprises determining that the computing device was
active at the time associated with the alert condition. For example, an active device includes
a device that is powered on (e.g., the display is on) and/or in active use according to some
embodiments. Likewise, determining that the application was in the inactive state comprises
determining that the computing device was inactive in some way at the time associated with
the alert condition. For example, a powered down device, a device in sleep or hibernation
mode, a device not in active use, a device with the display turned off each correspond to an
inactive device in various circumstances.
[0183]       In accordance with a determination that the application was in an active state at
the time associated with the alert condition, the device 100 provides 715 a first haptic output
having a first set of output characteristics, according to some embodiments.
[0184]       The first set of characteristics for the first haptic output includes one or more of:
an amplitude, a duration, a regularity, a repetition frequency, or a variations of atomic haptic
features of the first haptic output. In some circumstances, the first haptic output is
accompanied by a first audio output. For example, a respective haptic output may be
accompanied by a corresponding audio output, with at least a portion of the respective audio
output concurrent with at least a portion of the respective haptic output, or the respective
audio output occurs close in time to the respective haptic output so that the respective haptic
output and the respective audio output are perceptually concurrent or simultaneous. The
haptic and audio waveforms need not be perfectly aligned, and the device 100 can take into
account the fact that for certain classes of haptic and audio outputs, the haptic and audio
outputs will be perceived by a user to be concurrent or simultaneous even if they are slightly
offset in time (e.g., because audio output is processed more quickly than haptic output, so
providing haptic output before providing audio output will, in some circumstance, cause a
user to perceive the audio and haptic output as occurring concurrently or simultaneously).
Variations in the accompanying audio portion also can vary between embodiments that
                                                   - 42 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                            PCT/US2015/041858
include an audio output. For example, each of an amplitude of an audio component
associated with the first output, a duration of the audio component associated with the first
output, one or more musical qualities (e.g., pitch, tone, etc.) associated with the audio
component associated with the first output, can vary in certain circumstances.
[0185]       The first and second sets of characteristics correspond to a device type of the
computing device, according to some embodiments. For example, for the same event, the
device 100 optionally provides different haptic outputs based on type of device (e.g., phone
vs. watch vs. laptop computer vs. other handheld device). In some embodiments, however,
the difference between the haptic component of the first output and the haptic component of
the second output are maintained without regard to the device on which they are being
performed. In this circumstance, on all device types the same pattern of haptic outputs is
provided, but the differences in amplitude of the haptic outputs is based on the device on
which the outputs are being performed.
[0186]       Variations in the device itself, and thus the specifics of the haptic outputs, vary
according to different embodiments. For example, in some circumstances the device has a
touch-sensitive display. In some embodiments, the first haptic output and the second haptic
output are provided via the touch-sensitive display on the computing device. In this example,
the device 100 can both received user touch input via the touch-sensitive display and provide
haptic output via the same touch-sensitive display. This bi-directional touch sensitivity
allows the device 100 to provide feedback based on received user input according to some
embodiments.
[0187]       As noticed above, the device 100 optionally determines a level of user
engagement associated with the user interaction at the time associated with the alert
condition. In these circumstances, the device 100 further determines one or more of the first
set of output characteristics for the first haptic output based on the determined level of
engagement. In some embodiments, amplitude, duration, repetition frequency of the audio
and/or haptic component may be varied inversely with a measure of user
interaction/engagement with the application. Thus, for higher degrees of user interaction, the
first set of output characteristics are selected so as to make the first output have a lower
intensity, such that it is more subtle and less perceptible. Thus, the user is not exposed to an
unduly strong signal when the user already has a high degree of engagement or interaction
with the application. If the user is less engaged, then a higher intensity signal is provided to
                                                  - 43 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                          PCT/US2015/041858
the user to draw additional attention to the device or application, according to some
embodiments. For example, if the detected user interaction comprises a touch input or touch
gesture (and/or user gaze) reflecting an elevated level of user interaction/engagement, then a
weaker or less pronounced output is provided to the user, since the user is likely aware of the
alert condition by virtue of being more engaged with the application (interacting with the
application through sight or touch). If the detected user interaction comprises a voice input
but no accompanying touch or gaze, reflecting lower level or measure of engagement with
the application, then a stronger and more pronounced output optionally is provided to draw
additional attention to the alert condition.
[0188]       In accordance with a determination that the application was in an inactive state at
the time associated with the alert condition, the device 100 optionally provides 720 a second
haptic output that represents the occurrence of the alert condition, the second haptic output
having a second set of output characteristics, wherein the second haptic output is different
from the first haptic output.
[0189]       According to some embodiments, the second haptic output is different and has a
greater intensity than the first haptic output. For example, the signal amplitude optionally is
larger, the frequency higher, and/or the duration longer than the first haptic output. The
second haptic output has a greater intensity than the first haptic output in some
circumstances. In some embodiments, the haptic component of the first output has a first set
of parameters (e.g., lower amplitude, less periodic/regular, lower repetition frequency or
count of events, shorter duration of output, less intrusive/perceptible/pronounced), is
constituted of a first set of haptic features or atomic haptic components that are less
pronounced (e.g., microtaps) during the active state of the device than a second set of
parameters during the second state. Similarly, if accompanied with respective audio
components, the audio component of the first output has a first set of parameters (e.g., lower
amplitude, shorter duration of output, less intrusive/perceptible/intense audio notes) during
the active state and a second set of parameters during the inactive state. The purpose of the
higher intensity output is to draw elevated user attention to the alert condition when the
application is in the inactive state according to some embodiments.
[0190]       As discussed above, the device 100 state optionally is used to determine the
modulation, or output characteristics, of the haptic output. For example, when the device is
in a power conserving state (e.g., because the device battery life has dropped below a
                                                  - 44 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                          PCT/US2015/041858
predefined threshold, such as 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20%), haptic outputs that conserve power
are used according to some embodiments (e.g., haptic outputs with lower amplitude, shorter
duration, and/or lower frequency), even if those haptic outputs are less likely to be noticed by
the user. When the device is not in the power conserving state, default haptic outputs are
used in some circumstances even if those haptic outputs do not conserve power (e.g., haptic
outputs with relatively higher amplitude, longer duration, and/or higher frequency relative to
the haptic outputs that conserve power). In some embodiments the difference between the
haptic component of the first output and the haptic component of the second output is
maintained even when power conserving haptic outputs are used because the device is in a
power conserving state.
[0191]       As with the first haptic output, the second haptic output optionally is accompanied
by an audio output, with the waveform of the second haptic output generated being based on,
mirroring, and synchronized to a waveform of the accompanying audio output. In some
embodiments, waveforms of the haptic components are generated from and match with,
mimic, mirror, or are synchronized to waveforms of the respective audio components, as
discussed in conjunction with Figure 6.
[0192]       Various combinations of haptic and audio can be output by the device to provide
different semantic information to the user. As a first example, the first haptic output is not
accompanied by audio output but the second haptic output is accompanied by an audio
output. As a second example, the first haptic output is accompanied by a first audio output
and the second haptic output is accompanied by a second audio output different from the first
audio output.
[0193]       A given haptic waveform can generate different perceptions and hence semantic
information when accompanied by different audio waveforms. For example, a haptic
component output with a high frequency audio tone results in different perceptible unit, and
hence semantic information as compared to the same haptic component output with a low
frequency audio tone. The high frequency tone may be used to draw elevated user attention
to a significant occurrence in the class of events represented by the haptic output, whereas the
low frequency tone may be used to indicate a state change in the class of events. For
example, a given haptic output may be used to indicate receipt of a text message, and
accompanied by either a high frequency tone for an urgent message (or one from a designated
sender) or a low frequency tone for a non-urgent message or one received from a non
                                                  - 45 -

designated sender. Additionally, for two related alerts (e.g., an alert corresponding to
receiving a text message and an alert corresponding to receiving a mail message) have
different corresponding audio components with the same cadence and thus use the same
haptic component (e.g., the shared haptic component provides information that the two alerts
correspond to message receipt alerts, while the different audio components provide
information as to which type of message was received).
[0194]      In some embodiments, the first haptic output is similar, identical, or substantially
identical to the second haptic output. As one example, the first haptic output is accompanied
by an audio output and the second haptic output is accompanied by the same audio output; in
this example the first haptic output is different from the second haptic output. Recall the
above example of the active email application 800 of Figure 8 and the inactive one of Figure
4A. Below is a table showing exemplary alert condition information for an email application
800 and outputs corresponding to the various conditions, states, modes, and conditions.

[0195]      Table 1 shows a variety of possible outputs based on variations of a single alert
condition of an email being received. The first seven rows show the application in an active
state with no new message, according to various modes that the application could be in when
the email is received: with the application displaying the mailboxes screen, displaying the
inbox, displaying a selected message, displaying the sent messages box, displaying a draft in
progress, an email search field, and when the application is executing in the background.
Since no new message is received in the first eight rows, no output (haptic or otherwise) is
present.

[0196]      However, the last eight rows show the condition of a new message being received
and the corresponding outputs. As shown, for most of the active modes, the haptic output is a
microtap and the audio output is an email received default audio. However, for the last row
in which the application is inactive and the second to last row in which the application is
active but is executing in the background, the haptic output is a fade tap and the audio output
remains the email received default. Thus, the audio output is maintained regardless of
whether the application is active, but the haptic output has a higher intensity (a fade tap
versus a microtap) when the application is inactive or executing in the background. Table 1
provides conditions and corresponding outputs according to some embodiments, but is
merely exemplary; other combinations of alerts, states, modes, conditions and outputs are
used according to different embodiments.
[0197]      As one example, at a first point in time, while the application is in the active state,
the device 100 detects 705 a first alert condition associated with the application and
responsive to detecting the first alert condition while the first application is in the active state,
provides 715 a first output representing the first alert condition. At a second point in time,
while the first application is in an inactive state, the device 100 detects a second alert
condition and responsive to detecting the second alert condition while that the application is
in the inactive state, providing 720 the second haptic output representing the second alert
condition, the second haptic output different from the first haptic output.
[0198]      It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in Figure
7 have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate that the described
order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of ordinary skill in
the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations described herein.
Additionally, it should be noted that details of other processes described herein with respect
to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 2500, 2600,
3000, and 3200) are also applicable in an analogous manner to method 700 described above
with respect to Figure 7. For example, the inputs, alert conditions, applications, states, and
haptic outputs described above with reference to method 700 optionally have one or more of
the characteristics of the inputs, alert conditions, applications, states, and haptic outputs
described herein with reference to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 900, 1000,

Alert Condition Trigger-based Haptic Output
[0199]      Alert conditions can be manually or automatically triggered. Whether a detected
alert condition was manually or automatically triggered provides the basis for providing a
corresponding haptic output, according to some embodiments. Providing haptic output that
correlates with whether an alert condition was manually or automatically triggered creates a
more efficient human-machine interface, thereby reducing the amount of time it takes for a
user to perform operations, which consequently reduces energy use and increases battery life
for battery powered devices. Figure 9 is a flow diagram of a method 900 for detecting an
alert condition associated with an application and providing a haptic output dependent on
whether the condition was triggered by a manually-initiated or automatically-initiated event
according to some embodiments. Note that in some embodiments, different steps may be
performed other than those shown in Figure 9.
[0200]      The method begins by the device 100 detecting 905 an alert condition associated
with an application. For an application executing on a computing device 100, the alert
condition takes various forms according to various embodiments. An alert condition is any
event, notification, or other alert directed to a user of the device. One type of alert condition
corresponds to an event that is triggered by a manually-initiated event, and a second type of
alert condition corresponds to an event that is triggered by an automatically-initiated event.
In some circumstances, the device 100 has a touch-sensitive display.
[0201]      Responsive to detecting the alert condition, the device 100 determines 910
whether the alert condition was triggered by a manually-initiated event. This step comprises
determining whether the alert condition corresponds to an event initiated by a human user.
Various circumstances can contribute to determination by the device 100 whether the event
was initiated by a human user, as further discussed below in conjunction with Table 2.
[0202]      In some embodiments, determining 910 that the alert condition characteristics
indicate that the alert condition was triggered by a manually-initiated event comprises
determining whether the alert condition corresponds to an event initiated by a human user
other than a user of the computing device. Some exemplary conditions for this determination
also are shown in Table 2 as discussed below.
[0203]      Determining that the alert condition was triggered by a manually-initiated event,
in some embodiments, comprises determining whether the alert condition corresponds to an
input received from a human user, identifying a user of the computing device, and
                                                  - 49 -

comprising an indication from the human user to alert the user of the computing device as to
the input. In some embodiments, the input received from a human user is from the user of the
device 100, however, in some embodiments the input is received from another user on
another device (e.g., a sender of a personal message from the other user to the device user).
[0204]      Table 2 shows a few exemplary circumstances under which the device 100 has
information used to determine 910 that the alert condition was triggered by a manually
initiated event, whether it was initiated by a human user, and whether that user was a user
different from the user of the device 100. The applications shown in Table 2 include
Messages, Email, Phone, Calendar, Timer, Activity Monitor, and Social Networking, but
could be any other applications providing similar information to the device 100 for making
this determination.

[0205]       For the examples shown, the human/auto column shows whether the particular
alert, condition, and application corresponds to an alert that could be manually (human)
initiated, automatically initiated, or if it could be initiated by either human or automatic
means. For example, the second, fourth, sixth, and seventh rows each indicate a manual
action by a human user. In these examples, an action has been taken specifically by the user
of the device (User column), such as user input into an application on the device (e.g., the
Message, Email, or Phone applications), so the device 100 can easily determine that the user
was human user, and the device user more specifically. However, in other circumstances
some alert conditions are of the type known to the device 100 as able to be generated either
manually, by a human user, or automatically. For example, rows one, three, and five have
alert conditions in this category. Specifically, a New message received in a Messages
application typically is a manual (human-initiated) event, e.g., a text or other message sent by
a different device user. However, messages also can be auto-generated by a system, such as
spain or advertising text messages. Similarly, a New email message can be initiated by either
a human user or automatically by a system, such as a mass email, spain email, or subscription
listserv email, which could be generated by a bot, for example. In the final example, an
Incoming call in a Phone application typically is a human-initiated event, but also can be an
auto-initiated call by a system auto-dialing a list of callers, e.g., soliciting donations or as part
of a political campaign. In each of these circumstances, additional information is needed
about the source of the alert condition to be able to make a more conclusive determination as
to whether the event was manually or automatically initiated.
[0206]       For example, for an email or message, the device 100 can determine whether the
alert condition corresponds to a personal communication from a sender in a list of contacts
managed, created, controlled, or otherwise associated with the user. The simplest example is
                                                   -51 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                          PCT/US2015/041858
an actual contacts file, such as contacts cards with email addresses or phone numbers, but
other contacts lists also include email addresses or phone numbers that the user previous has
communicated to or from in some circumstances. These examples are just that; there are
many other means by which the device 100 could ascertain whether a communication is
likely to have been initiated manually by a human user.
[0207]      Another example is shown in the second to last row of Table 2. In this example, a
Social Networking application sends a Notification that the user has been Tagged in a post.
While the communication itself came from a social networking server, the content of the
Notification indicates that the post was initiated manually by a human user who is connected
to the device user within the social networking application.
[0208]      In accordance with a determination that the alert condition was triggered by a
manually-initiated event, the device 100 provides 915 a first haptic output corresponding to a
manually-initiated event notification according to some embodiments.
[0209]      Once the device 100 determines that the alert condition was initiated by a manual
event, a haptic output is provided that corresponds to the alert condition. The first haptic
output is provided via a touch-sensitive display of the computing device, according to some
embodiments. In some embodiments, the determining further comprises determining a
measure of urgency associated with the manually-initiated event and modulating 912 an
intensity of the first haptic output based on the measure of urgency. For example, the device
100 analyzes the content of an incoming message from another end user to determine the
urgency of the message. Accordingly, the device 100 examines date information in an email
or subject/contents of a message, keywords used in the subject or message (e.g., "urgent"), or
examines metadata included in the message such as an "important" flag in some
embodiments. The device 100 determines whether senders or recipients of the message
include individuals flagged by the user as important people or with some other special
designation according to some embodiments. The device 100 then provides 915 haptic
and/or audio output that is proportionate in intensity (e.g., amplitude, duration, frequency) to
the urgency associated with the content of the incoming message. In general, expected or
less urgent notifications/outputs have one set of output characteristics and unexpected
notifications have a second set of output characteristics that are more intense, in order to
attempt to draw elevated user attention, according to some embodiments.

    WO 2016/036447                                                            PCT/US2015/041858
[0210]       In some circumstances, the device 100 determines one or more contextual
attributes associated with the manually-initiated event and modulates 912 the intensity of the
haptic output on that basis. For example, various factors may be considered to evaluate
contextual attributes associated with an incoming manual notification and the strength of the
haptic or audio notification that should be provided. Contextual attributes include an identity
of the recipient sending the message, inclusion of and identification of other recipients of the
message, timing of receiving the message, location of the user when receiving the
notification, activity being performed by the user when receiving the notification, the
medium used to communicate the message, etc.; this list is not exhaustive.
[0211]       According to some embodiments, wherein the first haptic output that corresponds
to the manually-initiated event notification is more intense than the second haptic output that
corresponds to the automatically-initiated event notification. For example, the more intense
output is more likely to draw elevated user attention to the manually-initiated event. In some
circumstances, by virtue of being more personal, targeted, and having a higher likelihood of
being directly relevant to the user of the device, the haptic for the manually-initiated alert
helps to draw the user's immediate attention to an event determined by the system to be more
in need of the user's immediate attention.
[0212]       For example, the first haptic output is characterized by a first set of characteristics
comprising one or more of: an amplitude of the first haptic output, a duration of the first
haptic output, a regularity associated with the first haptic output, repetition frequency of
haptic features in the first haptic output, and a selection of haptic features constituting the
first haptic output, according to some embodiments. The second haptic output is
characterized by a second set of characteristics comprising one or more of: an amplitude of
the second haptic output, a duration of the second haptic output, a regularity associated with
the second haptic output, repetition frequency of haptic features in the second haptic output,
and a selection of haptic features constituting the second haptic output.
[0213]       In some circumstances two manually-initiated events can be received in a row. A
first alert condition can be detected corresponding to an incoming email message from a first
human sender and responsive to determining that the incoming email message corresponds to
a manually-initiated event, the device 100 provides the first haptic output. A second alert
condition is detected corresponding to an incoming text message from a second human
sender and responsive to determining that the incoming text message corresponds to a
                                                 - 53 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                          PCT/US2015/041858
manually-initiated event, the device 100 provides the first haptic output. Many other
variations are possible according to some embodiments.
[0214]       In response to detecting the alert condition associated with the application, in
accordance with a determination that the alert condition was triggered by an automatically
initiated event, the device 100 provides 920 a second haptic output corresponding to an
automatically-initiated event notification, wherein the second haptic output is different from
the first haptic output.
[0215]       Many examples exist of alert conditions triggered by automatically-initiated
events. Referring again to Table 2, the alert conditions for the Calendar, Timer, and Activity
Monitor applications each are of the automatic variety, and are generated by the application
itself. In a slightly different example, the last row shows an alert condition that is an Activity
Summary for social networking in the form of an email. In this example, the alert condition
is a scheduled, regular occurrence. Thus, even though the summary may include some event
information related to user-initiated actions (e.g., the example above of being tagged in a post
by another user), the email from the social network summarizes activity over the course of a
day or a week that includes the specific post, but the email is not considered a manually
initiated event, because it was not triggered by a request or indication from a human user (it
merely includes that information). The second haptic output is provided via a touch-sensitive
display of the computing device, according to some embodiments.
[0216]       According to some embodiments, the device 100 determines that the alert
condition was automatically triggered by the application (e.g., a predetermined or scheduled
alert such as a reminder notification or an automated alarm generated by the application), or
was an automatically-initiated event notification received by the application from a source
external to the device (e.g., an automatically/system-generated email or message). For
example, a sender's email address of noreply@domain.com is a hint that the email was sent
by automatic means, as there is no actual human sender to reply to in response to the email.
[0217]       In accordance with a determination that the automatically-initiated event
corresponds to an event occurring external to the device 100, the device 100 provides a first
variant of the second haptic output according to some embodiments, corresponding to a
notification of an externally occurring automatically-initiated event. Likewise, in accordance
with a determination that the automatically-initiated event corresponds to an event initiated
within the device, the device 100 provides a second variant of the second haptic output
                                                  - 54 -

corresponding to a notification of an internally-generated, automatically-initiated event.
Thus, different notifications are provided for the same application depending on whether the
event was generated by an incoming message or not according to some embodiments.
[0218]       Determining by the device 100 that the alert condition occurs at predetermined
time or reports on satisfaction of a predetermined triggering condition indicates that the alert
condition has an automatic trigger according to some embodiments. For example, satisfaction
of some predetermined triggering condition (e.g., your activity goal for the day has been met,
you have left the geo-fenced area, etc.) is an automatic-type trigger.
[0219]       As with manually-initiated alert triggers, the device 100 analyzes characteristics
associated with the alert condition to determine one or more contextual attributes associated
with the automatically-initiated event and modulates 912 intensity of the second output based
on the one or more contextual attributes. Various factors are considered when evaluating
contextual attributes associated with an automated notification and the strength of the haptic
or audio notification that should be provided according to various circumstances. For
example, the type of notification (e.g., a one-time event versus a repeating event such as a
periodic/repeating alarm), location of the user at a time of occurrence of the event, externally
triggered or internally triggered notifications, activities being performed by the user at a time
of receiving the notification, and for an external notification, the medium used to
communicate the message.
[0220]       As with manually-triggered events, for an automatically-initiated event the device
100 determines a time-varying measure of urgency associated with the automatically-initiated
event and modulates 912, over a specified window of time, a intensity of the second haptic
output to indicate the time-varying measure of urgency. For example, for an automatically
initiated (e.g., internal, prescheduled) trigger, the set of haptic parameters are modulated 912
based on urgency or timing of the event associated with the notification. For instance, for a
camera application, the device 100 provides a series of microtap outputs building up to the
photo being taken, the intervals between the microtaps progressively decreasing as the time
for taking the photo approaches according to some embodiments, providing a time-varying
output that builds up the sense of urgency or aids in user understanding of the timing factor.
[0221]       In some embodiments, the first set of characteristics for the first haptic output
differs from the second set of characteristics for the second haptic output. Similarly, if
accompanied by respective audio components, the audio component of the first output has a
                                                  - 55 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                           PCT/US2015/041858
first set of parameters (higher amplitude, longer duration of output, more
intrusive/perceptible/pronounced audio notes) for the manually-initiated event notification
than for the automatically-initiated event notification.
[0222]       A specific example includes detecting an alert condition associated with an
application and responsively determining whether the alert condition corresponds to a
personal communication from a sender in a list of contacts associated with the user, in which
case a first haptic output corresponding to a personal alert notification is provided, or whether
the alert condition does not correspond to a personal communication from a sender in a list of
contacts associated with the user, in which case a second haptic output corresponding to an
automatic alert notification is provided, with the first haptic output having a greater intensity
than the second haptic output.
[0223]       A haptic output optionally is accompanied by a corresponding audio output, with
at least a portion of the respective audio output being concurrent with at least a portion of the
respective haptic output, or the respective audio output occurring close in time to the
respective haptic output so that the haptic output and the respective audio output are
perceptually concurrent or simultaneous. The haptic and audio waveforms need not be
perfectly aligned, and the device 100 can take into account the fact that for certain classes of
haptic and audio outputs, the haptic and audio outputs will be perceived by a user to be
concurrent or simultaneous even if they are slightly offset in time (e.g., because audio output
is processed more quickly than haptic output, so providing haptic output before providing
audio output will, in some circumstance, cause a user to perceive the audio and haptic output
as occurring concurrently or simultaneously). Variations in the accompanying audio portion
also can vary between embodiments that include an audio output. For example, each of an
amplitude of an audio component associated with the first output, a duration of the audio
component associated with the first output, one or more musical qualities (e.g., pitch, tone,
etc.) associated with the audio component associated with the first output, can vary in certain
circumstances.
[0224]       As with the first haptic output, the second haptic output is accompanied by an
audio output, with the waveform of the second haptic output generated being based on,
mirroring, and synchronized to a waveform of the accompanying audio output, according to
some embodiments. In some embodiments, waveforms of the haptic components are
                                                  - 56 -

generated from and match with, mimic, mirror, or are synchronized to waveforms of the
respective audio components, as discussed in conjunction with Figure 6.
[0225]       Various combinations of haptic and audio waveforms are output according to
some embodiments. According to some embodiments, the first haptic output is not
accompanied by audio output but the second haptic output is accompanied by an audio
output. In one example, the first haptic output is accompanied by a first audio output and the
second haptic output is accompanied by a second audio output; in this case the first haptic
output is identical to the second haptic output and the first audio output is different from the
second audio output. In some embodiments, the same haptic waveform generates different
perceptions when accompanied by different audio waveforms. For example, if an audio
(ring) tone is played with a high pitch versus a low pitch, and accompanied by the same
haptic component (or substantially similar haptic components that a typical user will not be
able to differentiate between), the perception of the haptic component differs despite the
identical haptic. The higher pitched or shrill version of the ring tone might be used with the
second output to draw elevated user attention. In some embodiments, the first haptic output
is similar, identical, or substantially identical to the second haptic output.
[0226]       In another example the first haptic output is accompanied by an audio output and
the second haptic output is accompanied by the same audio output; in this example the first
haptic output is different from the second haptic output.
[0227]       It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in Figure
9 have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate that the described
order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of ordinary skill in
the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations described herein.

with respect to Figure 9. For example, the inputs, alert conditions, events, applications,
states, and haptic outputs described above with reference to method 900 optionally have one
or more of the characteristics of the inputs, alert conditions, events, applications, states, and
haptic outputs described herein with reference to other methods described herein (e.g.,

Feedback versus Notification-based Haptic Output
[0228]       Alert conditions can be triggered by user input or by predetermined system events
(e.g., reminders, notification). Whether a detected alert condition is associated with user
input or a predetermined system event provides the basis for providing a corresponding
haptic output, according to some embodiments. Providing haptic output that correlates with
the type of alert condition creates a more efficient human-machine interface, thereby
reducing the amount of time it takes for a user to perform operations, which consequently
reduces energy use and increases battery life for battery powered devices. Figure 10 is a flow
diagram of a method 1000 for detecting a first alert condition from user input and a second
alert condition from a predetermined event associated with an application and providing
corresponding haptic outputs according to some embodiments. Note that in some
embodiments, different steps may be performed other than those shown in Figure 10.
[0229]       The method begins by detecting 1005 a first alert condition on the computing
device 100 associated with receiving user input to an application. The first alert condition
can be any of the various alert conditions described elsewhere herein, and the application can
be any application executing on the device 100, according to some embodiments. According
to some embodiments, the computing device 100 comprises a touch-sensitive display for
receiving the user input.
[0230]       Responsive to detecting the first alert condition, the device 100 provides 1010 a
first haptic output having a first intensity and corresponding to the user input to the
application, according to some embodiments. The first haptic output optionally is feedback
provided in direct response to and as a consequence of the user input. According to some
embodiments, more intense haptics (e.g., higher amplitude or longer haptics) are used for
unexpected alerts that are not responsive to user input than those haptics used for feedback
that is in direct response to user inputs. In some embodiments, unexpected alerts are alerts
that occur outside of a context where the user's attention is directed toward the device (e.g.,
alerts that occur while a user is not actively using the device or while the user is not looking
at the device). For example an electronic message alert that is generated by the device while
the user of the device is wearing the device but not looking at the device and not interacting
with a messaging app is an unexpected alert, while the same alert received while the user is
looking at the device an/or has the messaging application open on the device would be an
expected alert. Similarly, feedback for specific user inputs (e.g., a "click" when a user places
                                                 - 58 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                           PCT/US2015/041858
a pin on a map) is expected by the user because the user is actively engaged with the device
and thus is more likely to notice a less intense haptic alert. According to some embodiments,
the first haptic output is provided via the touch-sensitive display on the computing device
100. The first intensity can be a pre-determined or adjustable combination of haptic
waveform amplitude, frequency, and/or duration, as described elsewhere herein.
[0231]       The device also 100 detects 1015 a second alert condition associated with
receiving a predetermined system event in the application. For example, the second alert
condition corresponds to an event that is automatically triggered by the application, or from
within the application. Such events include an alert that occurs at a predetermined time or
reports on satisfaction of a predetermined criterion, a reminder notification or an alarm
generated by the application, an automatically-initiated event notification received by the
application (e.g., an automatically/system generated email or message such as a system
generated mass mail, spam, system-generated email directed to a mailing list, etc.), or a
manually initiated event notification received by the application (e.g., an event initiated by a
human user-such as an incoming message or call from a known email address or phone
number on the user's contact list), according to various embodiments.
[0232]       Responsive to detecting the second alert condition, the device 100 provides 1020
a second haptic output having a second intensity, and corresponding to the predetermined
system event, wherein the second intensity is greater than the first intensity. The second
intensity is greater than the first intensity in one or more of amplitude, frequency, and/or
duration. When the computing device 100 comprises a touch-sensitive display, the second
haptic output is provided via the touch-sensitive display on the computing device.
[0233]       The greater second intensity of the second haptic output is so designed to draw
elevated user attention to alert conditions that do not result from user input. For example,
user feedback while using an application - in which case a finger may already be touching
the device 100 - requires a lesser haptic output for the user to notice it as compared to a user
who is not touching the device with a finger. The feedback while touching the device is
expected by the user, and thus optionally is weaker and more subtle than unexpected output.
Direct manipulation should result in short, immediate haptic feedback (<100 ms) according
to some embodiments. Haptic feedback is less intrusive (e.g., has lower amplitude, fewer
haptic features, more periodic/repetitive, shorter duration, weaker haptic features, etc.) when
it is responsive to a user input. Notifications, on the other hand, often are unexpected output,
                                                  - 59 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                            PCT/US2015/041858
and thus need to be stronger in order to draw elevated user attention in some circumstances.
Thus, notifications optionally are longer (~1.5s) and more intrusive.
[0234]       As an example, a device 100 detects 1005 a first alert condition corresponding to
a user selection of a user interface element displayed on an application user interface
associated with a first application, and responsive to the first alert condition, provides 1010 a
respective first haptic output representing the user selection of a user interface element, the
respective first haptic output comprising a first haptic component including a first haptic
feature of a first intensity and a first duration, according to some embodiments. After
providing the respective first haptic output, the device 100 detects 1015 a second alert
condition corresponding to an alert notification received by the first application, and
responsive to the second alert condition, provides 1020 a respective second haptic output
representing the receipt of the alert notification, the respective second haptic output
comprising a second haptic component: (1) including a second haptic feature of a second
intensity and a second duration, and (2) different from and more pronounced than the
respective first output, based on the second haptic feature being more pronounced than the
first haptic feature, the second intensity being greater than the first intensity, or the second
duration being longer than the first duration according to some embodiments. For example,
an incoming phone call might have a more intense haptic output than answering or hanging
up a call on a phone application.

[0235]      Table 3 shows a phone application and outputs corresponding to three different
alert conditions: incoming call, answer call, and hang up call. In this example, a user
answering or hanging up a call an action that is expected by the user taking the action, and
thus the corresponding haptic output that accompanies the action is considered feedback to
the user. For these two alert conditions, the haptic output is less intense (e.g., a microtap). In
contrast, an incoming call is a more unexpected type of alert condition, and in fact one that

exists for a limited period of time, and thus has a haptic with a greater intensity intended to
get the user's attention (e.g., a buzz-buzz). According to some embodiments, more intense
haptics (e.g., higher amplitude or longer haptics) are used for unexpected alerts that are not
responsive to user input than those haptics used for feedback that is in direct response to user
inputs.
[0236]       Table 3 provides conditions and corresponding outputs according to some
embodiments, but is merely exemplary; other combinations of alerts, states, modes,
conditions, and outputs are used according to different embodiments.
[0237]       In some circumstances, haptic outputs can vary based on whether they result from
a specific user input or not. In some embodiments, the device 100 first detects a first alert
condition associated with a first application, the first alert condition resulting from a
respective user input. For example, a user providing touch inputs to type an email message in
an email application. The device 100 provides a respective first haptic output representing
the first alert condition according to some embodiments. Continuing the above example, the
device provides low intensity, short interval buzzes for each user contact input. After
providing the respective first haptic output, the device 100 detects a second alert condition
associated with the first application, the second alert condition not resulting from receiving
user input. In the email application context, this alert condition optionally is an incoming
email in email application. The device 100 then provides a respective second haptic output
representing the second alert condition, the respective second haptic output different from
and having greater intensity than the respective first output according to some embodiments.
For example, the second haptic output optionally has a higher intensity and/or prolonged taps
to notify a user of the device of the incoming message.
[0238]       The first and second haptic outputs can have various characteristics that impact
their intensity and their ability to draw the attention of the user according to some
embodiments. For example, a first haptic output has a first set of characteristics comprising
one or more of: an amplitude of the first haptic output, a duration of the first haptic output, a
regularity associated with the first haptic output, repetition frequency of haptic features in the
first haptic output, a selection of haptic features constituting the first haptic output and the
second haptic output has a second set of characteristics comprising one or more of: an
amplitude of the second haptic output, a duration of the haptic component associated with the
second haptic output, a regularity associated with the second haptic output, repetition

frequency of haptic features in the second haptic output, a selection of haptic features
constituting the second haptic output. Any of the characteristics can differ between the first
and second haptic, or all of them can be different according to various embodiments.
[0239]       Various combinations of haptic and audio are output according to some
embodiments. According to some embodiments, the first haptic output is not accompanied
by audio output but the second haptic output is accompanied by an audio output. In one
example, the first haptic output is accompanied by a first audio output and the second haptic
output is accompanied by a second audio output; in this case the first haptic output is
identical to the second haptic output and the first audio output is different from the second
audio output. In some embodiments, the same haptic waveform generates different
perceptions when accompanied by different audio waveforms. For example, if an audio
(ring) tone is played with a high pitch versus a low pitch, and accompanied by the same
haptic component (or substantially similar haptic components that a typical user will not be
able to differentiate between), the perception of the haptic component differs despite the
identical haptic. The higher pitched or shrill version of the ring tone might be used with the
second output to draw elevated user attention. In some embodiments, the first haptic output
is similar, identical, or substantially identical to the second haptic output.
[0240]       Any of the haptic outputs can be accompanied by an audio output, with the
waveform of the second haptic output generated being based on, mirroring, and synchronized
to a waveform of the accompanying audio output according to some embodiments. In some
embodiments, waveforms of the haptic components are generated from and match with,
mimic, mirror, or are synchronized to waveforms of the respective audio components, as
discussed in conjunction with Figure 6. The haptic and audio waveforms need not be
perfectly aligned, and the device 100 can take into account the fact that for certain classes of
haptic and audio outputs, the haptic and audio outputs will be perceived by a user to be
concurrent or simultaneous even if they are slightly offset in time (e.g., because audio output
is processed more quickly than haptic output, so providing haptic output before providing
audio output will, in some circumstance, cause a user to perceive the audio and haptic output
as occurring concurrently or simultaneously). Variations in the accompanying audio portion
also can vary between embodiments that include an audio output. For example, each of an
amplitude of an audio component associated with the first output, a duration of the audio
component associated with the first output, one or more musical qualities (e.g., pitch, tone,
                                                   - 63 -

etc.) associated with the audio component associated with the first output, can vary in certain
circumstances.
[0241]      In some embodiments, there is coordination between the haptic intensity and the
volume of the device. For example, the first intensity of the first haptic output and the second
intensity of the second haptic output is adjusted in inverse relation to a volume setting on the
device, such that the haptic output optionally is intensified, either independently or over and
above the default/predetermined intensity settings, if the audio channel is turned off or turned
down.
[0242]      In some embodiments, prior to providing the first haptic output, the device 100
determines 1025 whether an input-based modulation condition exists, and responsive to
determining that an input-based modulation condition exists, prior to providing the first
haptic output, the device 100 modifies 1030 the first haptic output.
[0243]      For example, one input-based modulation condition is user engagement. In this
case, the device 100 detects a respective alert condition and determines that the respective
alert condition resulted from a respective user input received on the computing device. Then
the device 100 identifies a measure of user engagement associated with the detected user
input and modulates the first signal intensity of the first haptic output based on the measure
of user engagement according to some embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, the
strength (e.g., amplitude, duration, repetition frequency) of the audio and/or haptic
components are varied inversely with a measure of user input interaction/engagement with
the application/device. For higher degrees/measures of user interaction/engagement (such as
touch or direct manipulation), the output characteristics are selected so as to make the first
output more subtle or less invasive/perceptible. Thus, the user is not bombarded with an
unduly strong feedback signal when the user has a high degree of engagement or interaction
with the application/device. For example, weakest output is provided for touch/direct
manipulation, e.g., if the user is making contact with the device while providing the input,
then the user should not be bombarded with unduly strong haptic feedback. On the other
hand, if the user is less engaged, then a stronger signal is provided to the user to draw
additional attention.

[0244]       Table 4 shows various levels of user engagement for alert conditions with
variations in the user's focus, and the resultant haptic output levels. The haptic output levels
shown can be thought of as a sliding scale of the level of haptic intensity needed to get the
user's attention in view of the primary and secondary user focus. For example, the highest
level of user engagement is direct manipulation of the application generating the alert
condition, when the alert condition is in the form of feedback. For example, if the user is
inputting information into an application, the application is already the user's primary focus,
so little haptic is necessary to get the user's attention, and thus the lowest level of haptic,
"Level 1," can be output. This may be the most minimal haptic possible, e.g., a single
microtap.
[0245]       Skipping to the third row, if the user it touching the device but is inputting into a
different application, the user is focused on the device, and thus has some level of
engagement, but since the user is using a different application than the one providing the
alert, the user has a lower engagement than if the user were inputting into the application
providing the alert. In this case, the appropriate output is a "Level 2" haptic output. For
example, a Level 2 output might be two microtaps in a row.
[0246]       Skipping to the second to last row, the user may have the application issuing the
alert active, but operating in the background, and may not be touching the device at the time
of the alert condition. As a result, it may take a greater haptic to get the user's attention in
this circumstance. Thus, a "Level 3" haptic output may be appropriate, e.g., a priming tap
followed by a microtap or series of microtaps.

    WO 2016/036447                                                            PCT/US2015/041858
[0247]       Finally, the last row shows a user with the application issuing the alert in an
inactive state. In some circumstances, the application is not executing even in the
background, or the device is asleep. In this instance, the maximum haptic, "Level 4," is
appropriate to get the user's attention. For example, a Buzz-Buzz haptic output might be
appropriate in some circumstances. According to some embodiments, more intense haptics
(e.g., higher amplitude or longer haptics) are used for unexpected alerts that are not
responsive to user input than those haptics used for feedback that is in direct response to user
inputs.
[0248]       This is just one example, using a limited number of circumstances and haptic
output examples, and assuming that all applications and alerts are treated the same, which
may not be the case in other circumstances. In addition, a particular level of haptic output
may be a "default" output, e.g., Level 2, and then depending on the user's focus the device
may adjust up or down the intensity of the haptic output. Table 4 provides conditions and
corresponding outputs according to some embodiments, but is merely exemplary; other
combinations of alerts, states, focuses, conditions and outputs are used according to different
embodiments.
[0249]       In some embodiments, the haptic output is modified based on the location of the
user input. In this example, the device 100 detects a respective alert condition and
determines that the respective alert condition resulted from receiving a tactile user input on
the device. The device 100 modulates a spatial haptic energy profile of the first haptic
output, by reducing the amplitude of haptic energy of the first haptic output such that it is
perceptible at the location of receiving the tactile user input on the device. The reduced
amplitude of the haptic energy may be such that it is not perceptible at locations farther from
the user's finger/tactile input location, according to some embodiments. For example, the
low amplitude may be perceptible by finger at the point of contact, but not the rest of the
hand and/or the wrist. Similarly, the device 100 in some embodiments detects a respective
alert condition and determines that the respective alert condition resulted from receiving a
tactile user input on the device, but then specifically identifies a location of receiving the
tactile user input on the device and modulates a spatial haptic energy profile of the first haptic
output by providing greater than a specified proportion of haptic energy of the first haptic
output within a specified radius threshold of the location of receiving the tactile user input on
the device. According to some embodiments, the location of receiving the tactile user input
                                                 - 66 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                           PCT/US2015/041858
on the device varies with time, and thus the spatial haptic energy also varies with time
corresponding to the time-varying location of receiving the tactile user input.
[0250]       According to some embodiments, morphological characteristics of the haptic
output mimic the tactile input. For example, the device 100 detects a respective alert
condition and determines that the respective alert condition resulted from receiving a tactile
user input, and then identifies time-varying morphological attributes of the tactile user input.
Time-varying morphological attributes of the tactile input include detection of a contact on a
touch-sensitive surface, monitoring whether the contact is maintained with the surface and
how far and in which direction it moves, determining amount of pressure placed on the point
of contact, etc., according to various embodiments. Then, the device 100 modifies, over
time, morphological characteristics of the first haptic output to mimic the time-varying
morphological attributes of the tactile user input. For example, morphological characteristics
of the first haptic output to mimic include varying the amplitude, duration, frequency, etc. of
the haptic output to mirror the tactile input.
[0251]       In some embodiments, waveforms of the haptic components need not be perfectly
aligned with the user tactile input, and the device 100 can take into account the fact that the
haptic outputs will be perceived by a user to be concurrent or simultaneous with the tactile
input even if they are slightly offset in time (e.g., because the haptic output is processed more
quickly than the user can perceive it as a delayed response, thus causing a user to perceive the
haptic output as occurring concurrently or simultaneously). In some embodiments, specific
haptic features of the available predetermined set of haptic features are selected to constitute
the haptic component of the first output, the selection based on which haptic features best
mimic the user input. Some examples include a microtap for a simple touch, pen-click tap for
a longer/deeper touch, buzz for a swipe, buzz with a boost at the end for a swipe ending in
finger lift-off. For example, the time-varying morphological attributes include a time
dependent contact pressure profile between the tactile user input and a touch-sensitive surface
of the computing device according to some embodiments, and the modifying comprises
modulating, with time, an energy profile of the first haptic output to mirror the time
dependent contact pressure profile between the tactile user input and the touch-sensitive
surface of the computing device.
[0252]       According to some embodiments, the haptic output can mimic the time duration of
a sustained user input, gesture, mechanical adjustment, or other device manipulation by the
                                                 - 67  -

    WO 2016/036447                                                          PCT/US2015/041858
user. For example, the device 100 first detects a respective alert condition, and determines
that the respective alert condition resulted from a sustained user input. The sustained user
input includes tactile user input on a touch-sensitive display on the computing device, rotting
a knob, pushing a button, or any other user input of device manipulation with a detectable
start/end time, according to some embodiments. In some embodiments, the device can
determine that the alert condition resulted from a gesture, mechanical adjustment, or the like.
Responsive to the determining, the device 100 initiates the first haptic output at an initiation
time of the sustained user input, detects termination of the sustained user input, and then
terminates the first haptic output at a termination time of the sustained user input (e.g.,
mimicking the user input). In some embodiments, the haptic output is initiated by/at a start
time of the user input and terminates at an end time of the user input. Therefore, the haptic
feedback/output extends substantially throughout the duration of time of the user input.
Haptic output could be provided at location of user input, not limited to a touch-sensitive
surface. For example, if a rotating knob on the side of a watch is turned, a haptic that feels
like a click could provide sustained feedback as the user turns the knob.
[0253]      In some embodiments, prior to providing the second haptic output, the device 100
determines 1035 whether an ambient condition-based modulation condition exists, and
responsive to determining that an ambient condition-based modulation condition exists, and
prior to providing the second haptic output, the device modifies 1040 the second haptic
output.
[0254]      For example, the device 100 determines whether an ambient condition exists as a
potential hindrance to the user perception of the haptic output. In this example, the device
100 determines whether one or more ambient conditions exist for the device as potential
interference to haptic output at a time of occurrence of the respective alert condition.
Ambient conditions include, according to some embodiments: noise (can include measured
ambient noise as well as identifying that the user is in a library, museum, movie theatre,
hospital or other place generally known to be quiet), movement/vibration impacting the
user's physical receptiveness to a haptic sensation, engagement level with the device (e.g., as
discussed above: viewing, touching, talking to), user proximity to the device (e.g., device on
the user's person vs. located at greater than a specified proximity threshold from the device,
etc.).

[0255]       Table 5 shows various ambient conditions that can be present during alert
conditions, and for various application states, and possible modifications to the haptic output
provided based on those conditions according to some embodiments. The ambient conditions
shown include low and high noise levels, low and high vibration levels, short and long
distances to a device, and high and low user engagement levels, which ties into the above
section and Table 4. The table is set up with examples of various ambient conditions and for
a given application state (active or inactive), how the haptic output might be modified to
adjust for the ambient condition. Table 5 only shows modification to haptic output, but
similar adjustments could be made to non-haptic output, such as audio. The Haptic
Modification column lists possible modifications of None (maintain default haptic for the
alert), Increase 1, 2, or 3, and Decrease 1, although many variations are possible; these are

just examples. For some conditions, such as High Noise, Low Vibration (Inactive), High
Vibration (Active), and Long Distance to Device (rows 3, 4, 6, 7, and 11), the device can
modify the default haptic by increasing it one or two steps, e.g., a microtap to a tap or two
microtaps, or a tap to a buzz, etc., in these ambient conditions that may cause some level of
distraction to the user. For other conditions, such as High Vibration (Inactive) or Long
Distance to Device (rows 8 and 12), the device can modify the default haptic by increasing it
by a greater amount, e.g., a microtap to a buzz, etc., in these ambient conditions that may
cause a greater level of distraction to the user. In some circumstances, the haptic may be
accompanied by audio output as part of the modification. Alternatively or in addition to
modifying the intensity of the haptic, the device may delay the haptic output until the ambient
condition becomes more conducive to the user receiving the haptic output, e.g., for the
ambient conditions marked Increase 3. In this example, the device may periodically
determine the ambient conditions to ascertain if the interfering ambient condition has
subsided and thus the haptic may be output. In other circumstances, no delay is applied.
These examples are very limited, using a limited number of circumstances and haptic output
examples, and assumes that all applications and alerts are treated the same, which may not be
the case in other circumstances.
 [0256]     In some embodiments, no modification is required because the ambient condition
does not cause the user much if any distraction (e.g., rows with "none" in the modification
column). Finally, under some ambient conditions the device may reduce the default haptic
associated with the alert condition, e.g., for a high engagement level, in which case lesser
output is needed since the user is engaged. Table 5 provides conditions and corresponding
outputs according to some embodiments, but is merely exemplary; other combinations of
ambient conditions, alerts, states, and outputs are used according to different embodiments.
 [0257]     According to some embodiments, the device 100 delays the haptic output. First
the device 100 makes a determination that no interferential ambient conditions exist for the
device. In this example, the device 100 provides a respective second haptic output based on
the state of receptiveness of the user, and in accordance with a determination that one or
more ambient conditions exist for the device as potential interference to haptic output, the
device 100 delays providing the respective second output to the user. For example, a delay
may continue until a subsequent instance in which no interferential ambient conditions exist
(e.g., the device 100 determines again at some later point in time whether the interfering
                                                 - 70 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                           PCT/US2015/041858
ambient condition exists). For example, if the user is very active (e.g., running or in the
midst of a workout) when the notification is received, and is therefore unable to perceive the
haptic sensation, the device can delay the haptic output until activity is completed, such as
waiting until the user has completed the activity, and then provide the haptic output
corresponding to the notification. Under other circumstances the alert is of sufficient urgency
that the device may not delay it regardless of ambient condition. In these examples, the
determination of ambient conditions act as a proxy for estimating the user's physical
receptiveness to a haptic sensation, for example, based on properties of the user's current
surroundings.
[0258]       According to some embodiments, the device 100 provides a variant of the haptic
output, e.g., a modification as described in conjunction with Table 5. In this example, the
device 100 detects a respective alert condition associated with a respective application and
determines that the respective alert condition did not result from receiving user input.
Responsive to determining that the respective alert condition did not result from receiving
user input, the device 100 determines whether one or more ambient conditions exist for the
device as potential interference to haptic output at a time of occurrence of the respective alert
condition, and in accordance with a determination that no interferential ambient conditions
exist for the device, the device 100 provides a first variant of the second haptic output to the
user, the first variant of the second haptic output having a first set of output characteristics.
For example, the variant can be a haptic output that is softer, of shorter duration, includes
more subtle haptic features (e.g., microtaps), according to some embodiments. In accordance
with a determination that one or more ambient conditions exist for the device as potential
interference to haptic output, the device 100 provides a second variant of the second haptic
output to the user, the second variant of the second haptic output having a second set of
output characteristics, the second set of characteristics different from the first set of
characteristics, and the second variant of the second haptic output having greater intensity
than the first variant of the second haptic output.
[0259]       In some embodiments, the device 100 can modify the haptic output to "prime" the
user. For example, a device 100 first detects a respective alert condition associated with a
respective application and then determines that the respective alert condition did not result
from receiving user input. Responsive to determining that the respective alert condition did
not result from receiving user input, the device provides a priming haptic output as a
                                                 - 71 -

precursor to the second haptic output, the priming haptic output designed to increase an
engagement level of a user operating the device to the second haptic output, wherein at least
a portion of the priming haptic output is more pronounced than the second haptic output,
according to some embodiments. The device 100 optionally provides the second haptic
output following and within a specified time interval of providing the priming haptic output.
[0260]      The device 100 can provide variations of priming according to some
embodiments. In one example, the priming haptic output comprises a priming haptic
component with a time-varying waveform morphology characterized by a progressively
increasing intensity of the haptic component with time. In some embodiments, the priming
haptic output includes a gradually increasing intensity of haptic waveform to subconsciously
prepare user for notification. After priming, a large increase in audio volume occurs in
concert with the haptic component according to some embodiments. In another example the
priming haptic output optionally comprises a priming haptic component with a time-varying
waveform morphology characterized by an emphasized haptic feature followed by a
progressively diminishing intensity of the haptic component. Alternatively, the device 100
can deliberately prime the user's sensitivity by providing a stronger priming haptic (and
optionally audio) output first and then follow it up with milder outputs once the user's senses
are primed, according to some embodiments. According to some embodiments, the second
haptic output is preceded by the priming haptic output and the first haptic output is provided
directly, without a corresponding preceding priming haptic output, in response to a
corresponding alert condition that results from a received user input. In various embodiments,
characteristics of the priming haptic output are selected based on an urgency or context
associated with the alert condition, with the intensity of the output mirroring the urgency of
the alert.

outputs described above with reference to method 1000 optionally have one or more of the
characteristics of the inputs, alert conditions, applications, and haptic outputs described
herein with reference to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 700, 900, 1100, 1200,

Haptic Output for Multi-part Operations
[0262]      Whether a detected alert condition is part of a multi-part operation provides the
basis for providing a corresponding haptic output, according to some embodiments.
Providing haptic output that correlates with whether an alert condition is part of a multi-part
operation creates a more efficient human-machine interface, thereby reducing the amount of
time it takes for a user to perform operations, which consequently reduces energy use and
increases battery life for battery powered devices. Figure 11 is a flow diagram of a method
1100 for detecting an alert condition associated with a multi-part operation and providing a
corresponding haptic output according to some embodiments. Note that in some
embodiments, different steps may be performed other than those shown in Figure 11.
[0263]      The method begins by receiving 1105 an input that corresponds to a first part of a
multi-part operation performed by an application executing on a computing device 100. In
some embodiments, the input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation is
detected on a touch-sensitive surface of the device 100.
[0264]      Responsive to receiving the input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part
operation, the device 100 initiates 1110 an ongoing haptic output sequence. The outgoing
haptic sequence can be ongoing in the sense that it is sustained, constant, varying but
continuing over a period of time, or intermittent according to various embodiments, so long
as it continues until the second input is received. In some embodiments, responsive to
detecting the input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation, the device also
initiates an ongoing audio output sequence to accompany the ongoing haptic output.
[0265]      According to some embodiments, the device 100 has a touch-sensitive surface,
and the haptic output sequence is provided via the touch-sensitive surface. For example, the
haptic output includes haptic vibration of the touch-sensitive surface in a predetermined
pattern that is perceptible to a user of the device that is touching the touch-sensitive surface.
[0266]      In some embodiments, in addition to the ongoing haptic output sequence, the
device 100 provides 1115 a first haptic feedback responsive to receiving the input
corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation. The first haptic feedback is
                                                 - 73 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                          PCT/US2015/041858
selected based on the event and indicating an initiation of the event, and is distinct from the
ongoing haptic output sequence in some circumstances. For example, the first haptic
feedback has a greater intensity haptic output than the ongoing haptic output sequence
according to some embodiments.
[0267]       After initiating the ongoing haptic output sequence, the device 100 receives 1120
an input that corresponds to a second part of the multi-part operation according to some
embodiments. For a device 100 having a touch-sensitive surface, the input corresponding to
the second part of the multi-part operation is detected on the touch-sensitive surface.
[0268]       In some embodiments two devices are involved. Thus, in some embodiments the
inputs corresponding to both the first part of the multi-part operation and the second part of
the multi-part operation are detected by the device 100. However, in some embodiments the
input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation is detected by the device 100
and the input corresponding to the second part of the multi-part operation detected by a
second device.
[0269]       According to some embodiments, additional user input can be received by the
device 100. For example, after initiating 1110 the ongoing haptic output sequence responsive
to the first part of the multi-part operation, and before receiving 1120 the input that
corresponds to the second part of the multi-part operation, the device 100 receives 1125 one
or more additional user inputs, distinct from the input that corresponds to the second part of
the multi-part operation according to some embodiments. In these circumstances, the device
continues to provide the ongoing haptic output regardless of the additional user inputs, until
receipt of the input corresponding to the second part of the multi-part operation, according to
some embodiments.
[0270]       Responsive to receiving the input corresponding to the second part of the multi
part operation, the device 100 terminates 1130 the ongoing haptic output sequence according
to some embodiments. In some embodiments, responsive to detecting the input
corresponding to the second part of the multi-part operation, the device 100 also terminates
any ongoing audio output sequence.
[0271]       The input corresponding to the second part of the multi-part operation follows the
input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation and is separated in time from
the input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation by a specified interval of
time corresponding to a duration of the event according to some embodiments. Further, the
                                                 - 74 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                          PCT/US2015/041858
ongoing haptic output sequence is provided throughout the duration of the event and
indicates occurrence of the event in some circumstances.
[0272]       According to some embodiments, the device also provides 1135 a second haptic
feedback responsive to receiving the input corresponding to the second part of the multi-part
operation, the second haptic feedback distinct from the ongoing haptic output sequence. The
second haptic feedback indicates termination of the event, and is distinct from the ongoing
haptic output sequence in some circumstances. For example, the second haptic feedback has
a greater intensity haptic output than the ongoing haptic output sequence according to some
embodiments.
[0273]       The multi-part operation can take various forms according to different
embodiments. According to some embodiments the multi-part operation is a secure
transaction, with the first part of the multi-part operation including arming the device to
authorize the secure transaction. In this example, in response to the user providing
credentials, e.g., a password or biometric authentication such as a fingerprint, the device is
put into in a payment mode where payment information can be provided to a payment
terminal via a near field communication (NFC) subsystem. Thus, the arming of the device is
the first part, and would initiate a corresponding ongoing haptic output. In addition, the
second part the multi-part operation includes authorizing the secure transaction according to
this example. The authorizing thus is the second step and includes, e.g., providing payment
information to the payment terminal when the NFC subsystem comes into range of an NFC
field of the payment terminal while the NFC subsystem is armed from the first step according
to some embodiments.
[0274]       In some embodiments of a NFC multi-part secure transaction, the first part of the
multi-part operation includes determining that user authentication is required to complete the
secure transaction. For example, in response to an NFC subsystem coming into range of an
NFC field of a payment terminal, prompting the user to provide credentials such as a
password or biometric authentications such as a fingerprint to authorize the secure
transaction. In this example, the second part the multi-part operation includes receiving user
authentication for the secure transaction. For example, the haptic output is provided to
remind a user that the user needs to provide user authentication information before the
payment process can proceed, the user authentication information optionally includes
passcode based or biometric based authentication. In some embodiments, a first haptic output
                                                 - 75 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                             PCT/US2015/041858
pattern is provided by the device between when the need for user authentication is
determined and when user authentication is received (e.g., between requesting user
authentication and receiving user authentication) to remind the user to provide user
authentication information, and a second haptic output pattern is provided by the device
between when the user authentication information is received and the secure transaction is
authorized (e.g., between receiving user authentication and providing the payment
information to the payment terminal). In this example, the second haptic output pattern is
different from the first haptic output pattern to remind the user to place the NFC subsystem
near the payment terminal according to some embodiments.
[0275]       According to other payment embodiments, the input corresponds to a secure
transaction that does not use NFC. In this example, the first part of the multi-part operation
is a selection of a first user interface element that initiates a transaction. For a financial
transaction such as an online purchase, selection of on element corresponding to activating an
online payment enables a user to enter a user interface for entering secure or confidential
information. As another example, a user requests to log into a secure location, such a secure
email account or online retailer. Continuing the above example, the multi-part operation
comprises one or more inputs for entry of information required to process the transaction.
For example, entry of credit card information and other verification information necessary to
authorize the financial transaction, and a corresponding ongoing haptic output sequence is
provided throughout the duration of entry of the information. Similarly the input may be
entry of username and password to log into a secure web account. In some embodiments, the
event corresponds to population of one or more data entry fields that receive the information
required to process the transaction and the input corresponding to the second part of the
multi-part operation is a selection of a user interface element that authorizes completion of
the transaction, e.g., an authorize payment user interface element.
[0276]       According to some embodiments, the first part of the multi-part operation includes
closing a draft of a document, and the second part of the multi-part operation includes
returning to the draft of the document. Examples of closing of the document include closing
a draft of an email or text message to switch to another task or to open another application on
the device and returning to the document includes switching back to the draft of the email or
text message from the other task or other application, according to various embodiments.

    WO 2016/036447                                                              PCT/US2015/041858
[0277]       In some embodiments the inputs are separate inputs occurring close together in
time. For example, the input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation is a
first user input interacting with an application executing on the device and the input
corresponding to the second part of the multi-part operation is a second user input interacting
with the application, with the second user input distinct from the first user input according to
some embodiments. For instance, the first user input into the application could be a first tap
and liftoff, and the second user input could be a second tap and liftoff within the same
application.
[0278]       In some circumstances the multi-part operation is a multi-part gesture. For
example, the operation comprises first detecting the input that corresponds to the first part of
the multi-part operation as a contact on a touch-sensitive surface of the device 100 and
detecting the input that corresponds to the second part of the multi-part operation includes
detecting movement of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface according to some
embodiments.      In the example of a swipe gesture, the first part is a user touching the touch
sensitive surface, and the second part is the user maintain in the contact with the surface
while moving the contact across the touch surface. In another example, the operation
comprises first detecting the input that corresponds to the first part of the multi-part operation
as movement of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface and detecting the input that
corresponds to the second part of the multi-part operation as detecting liftoff of the contact
from the touch-sensitive surface.
[0279]       According to some embodiments, the inputs corresponding to the first and second
parts of the multi-part operation comprise a single gesture, wherein the input corresponding
to the first part of the multi-part operation is an initial part of the gesture (e.g., touch and hold
with a finger contact) and the input corresponding to the second part of the multi-part
operation is a subsequent part of the gesture (e.g., a liftoff of the finger contact). For
example, in a text editing or viewing application, holding a finger down on a word first
highlights the word and then continuing to hold the finger down on the highlighted word
invokes a cut-copy-paste menu. In this example, the liftoff of the contact would represent
selection of a displayed aspect corresponding to the touch and hold.
[0280]       In some embodiments, the gesture is initiated on a portion of the touch-sensitive
surface that corresponds to a first location in a user interface displayed on a display of the
device 100 and terminates on a second portion of the touch-sensitive surface that corresponds
                                                  - 77 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                            PCT/US2015/041858
to a second location in the user interface that is different from the first location. For example,
a touch-swipe-liftoff sequence can be used to perform a drag and drop, or to relocate a focal
region in a camera viewer, according to some embodiments.
[0281]       According to some embodiments, the input corresponding to the first part of the
multi-part operation initiates an event associated with the respective application and the event
is sustained until receipt of the input corresponding to the second part of the multi-part
operation, at which time the input corresponding to the second part of the multi-part
operation terminates the event associated with the respective application. For example, the
first input is a selection of a user interface element (e.g., provided on the application user
interface of an application) that initiates an event associated with the application and the
second input is a selection of a different user interface element (e.g., on the application user
interface of the same application) that terminates the event associated with that application
according to some embodiments.
[0282]       The application is a text editing application according to some embodiments, and
the input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation is a selection of a first user
interface element that enables a text-entry mode of the text editing application. In this
example, the multi-part operation comprises one or more inputs for text-entry to the text
editing application, the event corresponds to text manipulation in the text editing document
responsive to the inputs for text-entry, and the input corresponding to the second part of the
multi-part operation is a selection of a user interface element that disables the text-entry
mode of the text editing application. According to some embodiments, the text editing
application is a communication application such as an email or messaging application that
allows the device user to communicate with other users. According to some embodiments,
the text editing application is a non-communication text editing application, such as a word
processing application, a notepad or sticky note application, or other application that allows
text entry but does not provide independent communication functionality.
[0283]       According to some embodiments, characteristics of the ongoing haptic output
sequence are selected based on the event that is initiated by the input corresponding to the
first part of the multi-part operation. For example, putting a call on hold is accompanied by a
lower intensity (e.g., lower energy, less invasive, less perceptible) haptic output sequence
than a financial transaction event or a secure login, for which the user has provided
confidential or secure information and thus is a transaction that should garner additional
                                                  - 78 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                           PCT/US2015/041858
attention. In this example, throughout the duration of the multi-part operation (e.g., after the
confidential information is entered but before the transaction is complete) the user is thus
reminded of the prior entry such that he or she completes the transaction quickly so as to
avoid compromising the confidentiality of the information being entered. In some
circumstances, a timeout function is used so that the confidential information is not left
available. Additionally, different haptic output patterns optionally provide the user with
information as to what task they are in the middle of completing.
[0284]      The input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation suspends an
ongoing event associated with the application, and the input corresponding to the second part
of the multi-part operation resumes the ongoing event associated with the application
according to some embodiments. For example, the first part initiates a pause in an ongoing
event in some circumstances. In some embodiments, the first input corresponds to a selection
of a user interface element that pauses an action, such as playing of a multimedia file, a video
clip, a song, or a phone call in progress, and the second input is a selection of a different) user
interface element that resumes the action.
[0285]      According to some embodiments, an intensity of the ongoing haptic output
sequence increases with time until a subsequent input corresponding to the multi-part
operation is received. For example, haptic energy (e.g., amplitude, frequency, haptic
features) of the ongoing haptic output sequence is modulated (e.g., via increasing intensity or
haptic energy) over time to remind the user with increasing urgency to provide further input
corresponding to the multi-part operation. Such an increasing output can correspond to a
reminder to terminate the event that was started by the first part of the multi-part input, or to
resume the event that was suspended by the first part of the multi-part input according to
various embodiments.
[0286]      In some embodiments, a time-varying haptic energy profile of the haptic output
sequence mimics a time-varying acoustic energy profile of the audio output sequence. As
discussed in conjunction with Figure 6, the time-varying waveform morphologies of the
haptic and audio sequences mimic, mirror, align, and/or synchronize with each other
according to some embodiments.
[0287]      According to some embodiments, the output includes audio output depending on
whether the first part of the multi-part operation initiates a new event or pauses an ongoing
event. Responsive to determining that the input corresponding to the first part of the multi

part operation does not pause an ongoing event, but initiates an event associated with the
respective application, the device 100 provides the haptic output sequence without an
accompanying audio output sequence, and responsive to determining that the input
corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation pauses an ongoing event associated
with the respective application, the device 100 provides an ongoing audio output sequence
accompanying the ongoing haptic output sequence according to some embodiments. In some
embodiments, the audio output sequence accompanies the haptic output sequence only when
the first part of the multi-part operation pauses or suspends an ongoing event or action.
During the pause, the user is presumably not as engaged with the device and/or application.
For instance, the user may be passively waiting for a call to be transferred, and therefore can
tolerate additional stimulus associated with an audio output. However, in some
embodiments, the audio sequence does not accompany the haptic sequence if an actual event
is initiated by the first part of the multi-part operation according to some embodiments, such
as a user actively typing an email message or entering secure financial or log in information.
[0288]       The application is a voice communication application according to some
embodiments. For example, the application can be a regular phone application, a voice over
internet application such as Skype, or a voice communication application embedded in an
email application such as Gchat according to some embodiments. The event is an ongoing
voice communication occurring at a time of receipt of the input corresponding to the first part
of the multi-part operation and the input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part
operation is a selection of a first user interface element of the voice communication
application, the selection suspending the ongoing voice communication according to some
embodiments. For example, a voice call is paused due to a call transfer or call on hold
request. The input corresponding to the second part of the multi-part operation is a selection
of a second user interface element that resumes the voice communication according to some
embodiments.
[0289]       It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in Figure
11 have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate that the described
order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of ordinary skill in

with respect to Figure 11. For example, the inputs, operations, applications, and haptic
outputs described above with reference to method 1100 optionally have one or more of the
characteristics of the inputs, operations, applications, and haptic outputs described herein

Haptic Output for Subset Operations
[0290]       Whether a detected request to perform an operation related to an operation that is
a subset of another operation provides the basis for providing a corresponding haptic output,
according to some embodiments. Providing haptic output that correlates with whether a
request to perform an operation pertains to an operation that is a subset of another operation
creates a more efficient human-machine interface, thereby reducing the amount of time it
takes for a user to perform operations, which consequently reduces energy use and increases
battery life for battery powered devices. Figure 12 is an exemplary method flow diagram of a
method 1200 for detecting first and second inputs to perform first and second operations,
performing the operations, and providing corresponding outputs according to some
embodiments. Note that in some embodiments, different steps may be performed other than
those shown in Figure 12.
[0291]       The method begins by detecting 1205 a first input that corresponds to a request to
perform a first operation. According to some embodiments, the computing device 100
comprises a touch-sensitive display, and the first input is received through the touch-sensitive
display according to some embodiments.
[0292]       According to some embodiments, responsive to detecting the first input, the
device 100 provides 1210 a first output that includes a haptic component. If the comprises a
touch-sensitive display, the haptic component of the first output is provided via the touch
sensitive display according to some embodiments.
[0293]       Also responsive to detecting the first input according to some embodiments, the
device 100 performs 1215 the first operation. The first operation can be any operation
performed by the device 100 in response to an input. The examples described below,
according to various embodiments, include capture of an image with a camera, a transaction
enable operation for enabling the device to authorize a secure transaction, a save operation
for saving content within an existing file, and a send operation for sending a reply to a

message that is in a message inbox, but this list is not meant to be exhaustive; other
operations by the device 100 are envisioned as following the steps of the method.
[0294]      After performing the first operation, the device 100 detects 1220 a second input
that corresponds to a request to perform a second operation that includes the first operation
and a supplemental operation according to some embodiments. If the computing device 100
comprises a touch-sensitive display, and the second input is received through the touch
sensitive display, according to some embodiments.
[0295]      According to some embodiments, responsive to detecting the second input the
device 100 provides 1225 a second output that includes a haptic component, wherein the
second output includes the first output in conjunction with providing supplemental output
that corresponds to the supplemental operation. If the comprises a touch-sensitive display,
the haptic component of the second output is provided via the touch-sensitive display
according to some embodiments.
[0296]      In some embodiments, the haptic component corresponding to the second output
comprises a first haptic component corresponding to the first output and a second haptic
component corresponding to the supplemental output, and the second haptic component is
distinct from the first haptic component. For example the second haptic component has a
higher intensity (e.g., amplitude, duration, frequency) than the first haptic component
according to some embodiments.
[0297]      The supplemental output comprises a non-haptic component according to some
embodiments. The non-haptic component can be any of audio or visual (e.g., graphic,
textual) according to various embodiments. In some embodiments the supplemental output
comprises an audio component but the first output does not include an audio component. For
example, an audio output is provided during an interval when a camera application measures
the specified interval of time counting down to the image capture, but the operation of
capturing the image itself is not accompanied by an audio sound.
[0298]      For supplemental output including audio output, a haptic output is accompanied
by a corresponding audio output according to some embodiments, and the audio and haptic
portion are aligned when at least a portion of the audio output is concurrent with at least a
portion of the haptic output, or the audio output occurs close in time to the haptic output
according to some embodiments. The haptic and audio waveforms need not be perfectly

audio outputs, the haptic and audio outputs will be perceived by a user to be concurrent or
simultaneous even if they are slightly offset in time (e.g., because audio output is processed
more quickly than haptic output, so providing haptic output before providing audio output
will, in some circumstance, cause a user to perceive the audio and haptic output as occurring
concurrently or simultaneously). Variations in the accompanying audio portion also can vary
between embodiments that include an audio output. For example, each of an amplitude of an
audio component associated with the first output, a duration of the audio component
associated with the first output, one or more musical qualities (e.g., pitch, tone, etc.)
associated with the audio component associated with the first output, can vary in certain
circumstances.
[0299]      In some embodiments, the same haptic waveform generates different perceptions
when accompanied by different audio waveforms. For example, if an audio (ring) tone is
played with a high pitch versus a low pitch, and accompanied by the same haptic component
(or substantially similar haptic components that a typical user will not be able to differentiate
between), the perception of the haptic component differs despite the identical haptic. The
higher pitched or shrill version of the ring tone might be used with the second output to draw
elevated user attention. In some embodiments, the first haptic output is similar, identical, or
substantially identical to the second haptic output.
[0300]      According to some embodiments, the second output comprises a textual
component that identifies the supplemental operation as different from the first operation.
For example, the textual component may describe the supplemental information. For
instance, an output corresponding to a send and archive operation provides a textual
information indicating that the message has been archived. As another example, an output
corresponding to a payment success message indicates that the secure information has been
validated.
[0301]      The supplemental operation has a variable value and the supplemental output is
based on the value of the variable attribute according to some embodiments. For example, a
time interval before a picture is taken by a camera can be five seconds, 10 seconds, 15
second, etc. according to various embodiments. For a 10 second camera timer, the
supplemental output thus correspondingly lasts for 10 seconds according to some
embodiments.

[0302]       According to some embodiments, the device 100 then performs 1230 the second
operation. The timing of the performance of the first and second operations, respectively, can
vary. According to some embodiments, the first operation is performed concurrently with
providing the first output and the supplemental operation is performed concurrently with
providing the supplemental output. For example, for a shutter self-timer, the first output is
provided when the timer counts down, which corresponds to the first operation, and the
supplemental output is provided when the shutter takes the picture, corresponding to the
supplemental operation.
[0303]       The first operation can be performed prior to performing the supplemental
operation and the first output provided prior to providing the supplemental output according
to some embodiments. For example, for a first operation corresponding to a send message
(e.g., email) function, a second operation is a send and archive operation, and the send
operation is performed prior to the supplemental operation, which is the archiving portion.
[0304]       According to some embodiments, at least a portion of the first operation is
performed concurrently with a portion of the supplemental operation and at least a portion of
the first output is provided concurrently with a portion of the supplemental output.
[0305]       A few examples follow that help to illustrate the steps of the method 1200. In a
first example, the first operation corresponds to capture of an image with a camera. The
camera is integrated into the device 100 or is remote from the device but is remotely
controlled by the device, according to various embodiments. The second operation in this
example corresponds to capturing an image after a specified interval of time. Specifically,
the method of this example begins by detecting a first input that corresponds to a request to
capture of a first image with a camera, and responsive to detecting the first input, provides a
first output that includes a haptic component according to some embodiments. Also
responsive to detecting the first input, the device 100 captures the first image. After
capturing the first image, the device 100 detects a second input that corresponds to a request
to capture a second image after a specified interval of time, and responsive to detecting the
second input provides a second output that includes a haptic component according to some
embodiments. In this example, the second output includes the first output in conjunction
with providing supplemental output that corresponds to measuring lapse of the specified
interval of time and the second image is captured after the specified interval of time.

[0306]      In another example, the first operation corresponds to a transaction-enable
operation for enabling the device to authorize a secure transaction and the second operation
corresponds to enabling the device to authorize a secure transaction and authorizing the
secure transaction according to some embodiments. For example, in an online payment
context in which credit card information is needed, the enable operation prepares an NFC
subsystem to provide payment credentials at a payment terminal or other point of sale, or a
user log in request that needs user credentials and password. Specifically, according to this
example the method begins by detecting a first input that corresponds to a request to perform
a transaction-enable operation for enabling the device to authorize a secure transaction, and
responsive to detecting the first input, providing a first output that includes a haptic
component. Also responsive to detecting the first input, enabling the device to authorize a
secure transaction. After performing the transaction-enable operation, detecting a second
input that corresponds to a request to authorize a secure transaction, and responsive to
detecting the second input, providing a second output that includes a haptic component,
wherein the second output includes the first output in conjunction with providing
supplemental output that corresponds to authorizing the secure transaction the supplemental
operation. Also responsive to detecting the second input, authorizing the secure transaction.
[0307]      The first operation corresponds to a save operation for saving content within an
existing file, and the second operation corresponds to a save-as operation to save content
within an existing file to a new file according to some embodiments. In this example, a first
input is detected that corresponds to a request to perform a save operation, and responsive to
detecting the first input, a first output is provided that includes a haptic component. Also
responsive to detecting the first input, the save operation is performed for saving content
within an existing file. After performing the save operation, a second input is detected that
corresponds to a request to perform a save as operation to save content within an existing file
to a new file, and responsive to detecting the second input, a second output is provided that
includes a haptic component, wherein the second output includes the first output in
conjunction with providing supplemental output that corresponds to a creation of the new file
according to some embodiments. Also responsive to detecting the second input, the save as
operation is performed.
[0308]      According to some embodiments the first operation corresponds to a send
operation for sending a reply to a message that is in a message inbox and the second
                                                   - 85 -

operation corresponds to a send and archive operation for sending a reply to a message that is
in the message inbox and removing it from the message inbox.
[0309]       It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in Figure
12 have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate that the described
order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of ordinary skill in
the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations described herein.
Additionally, it should be noted that details of other processes described herein with respect
to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 700, 900, 1000, 1100, 1300, 2500, 2600,
3000, and 3200) are also applicable in an analogous manner to method 1200 described above
with respect to Figure 12. For example, the inputs, operations, applications, components, and
haptic outputs described above with reference to method 1200 optionally have one or more of
the characteristics of the inputs, operations, applications, components, and haptic outputs
described herein with reference to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 700, 900,
1000, 1100, 1300, 2500, 2600, 3000, and 3200). For brevity, these details are not repeated
here.
Alert Condition Class-associated Haptic Output
[0310]       Whether two detected alert conditions are in the same or different class of alert
condition provides the basis for providing a corresponding haptic output, according to some
embodiments. Providing haptic output that correlates with whether alert conditions are in the
same or different class of alert condition creates a more efficient human-machine interface,
thereby reducing the amount of time it takes for a user to perform operations, which
consequently reduces energy use and increases battery life for battery powered devices.
Figure 13 is an exemplary method flow diagram of a method 1300 for detecting first and
second alert conditions and providing corresponding outputs according to some
embodiments. Note that in some embodiments, different steps may be performed other than
those shown in Figure 13.
[0311]       The method begins by detecting 1305 occurrence of a first alert condition
according to some embodiments. The first alert condition can be any of the various alert
conditions described elsewhere herein.
[0312]       According to some embodiments, a first output is provided 1310 that includes a
first haptic component and a first non-haptic component responsive to detecting the
occurrence of the first alert condition. The non-haptic component can be any of audio or
                                                 - 86 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                           PCT/US2015/041858
visual (e.g., graphic, textual) according to various embodiments. When an audio component
is included, the audio and haptic components are aligned according to some embodiments.
The haptic and audio waveforms need not be perfectly aligned, and the device 100 can take
into account the fact that for certain classes of haptic and audio outputs, the haptic and audio
outputs will be perceived by a user to be concurrent or simultaneous even if they are slightly
offset in time (e.g., because audio output is processed more quickly than haptic output, so
providing haptic output before providing audio output will, in some circumstance, cause a
user to perceive the audio and haptic output as occurring concurrently or simultaneously).
According to some embodiments, the non-haptic portion includes a textual component.
[0313]       After providing the first output, the device 100 detects 1315 occurrence of a
second alert condition, and responsive to detecting the occurrence of the second alert
condition, provides 1320 a second output that includes a second haptic component and a
second non-haptic component according to some embodiments. When the first alert
condition and the second alert condition are different alert conditions that are in a same class
of alert condition, the first output and the second output share one or more same components
and have one or more different components according to some embodiments. Alternatively,
when the first alert condition and the second alert condition are in a same class of alert
condition, the first and second outputs have one or more components in common. When the
first alert condition and the second alert condition are different alert conditions that are in
different classes of alert condition, the first haptic component is different from the second
haptic component and the first non-haptic component is different from the second non-haptic
component according to some embodiments. Alternatively, when the first alert condition and
the second alert condition are in different classes of alert condition, the first and second
outputs have no common components.
[0314]       Classes of alert conditions include messages, activity alerts, media playback
alerts, virtual assistant alerts, system alerts, scheduling reminders, and internet browser
updates according to some embodiments.
[0315]       According to some embodiments, when the first alert condition and the second
alert condition correspond to separate instances of the same alert condition, the first output is
identical to the second output. If the computing device 100 has a touch-sensitive display, the
first haptic component of the first output and the second haptic component of the second
output are provided via the touch-sensitive display on the computing device.

[0316]      In some embodiments, the first and second non-haptic components are audio
outputs. For non-haptic output including audio output, a haptic output is accompanied by a
corresponding audio output according to some embodiments, and the audio and haptic
portion are aligned when at least a portion of the audio output is concurrent with at least a
portion of the haptic output, or the audio output occurs close in time to the haptic output
according to some embodiments. The haptic and audio waveforms need not be perfectly
aligned, and the device 100 can take into account the fact that for certain classes of haptic and
audio outputs, the haptic and audio outputs will be perceived by a user to be concurrent or
simultaneous even if they are slightly offset in time (e.g., because audio output is processed
more quickly than haptic output, so providing haptic output before providing audio output
will, in some circumstance, cause a user to perceive the audio and haptic output as occurring
concurrently or simultaneously). Variations in the accompanying audio portion also can vary
between embodiments that include an audio output. For example, each of an amplitude of an
audio component associated with the first output, a duration of the audio component
associated with the first output, one or more musical qualities (e.g., pitch, tone, etc.)
associated with the audio component associated with the first output, can vary in certain
circumstances.
[0317]      In some embodiments, the same haptic waveform generates different perceptions
when accompanied by different audio waveforms. For example, if an audio (ring) tone is
played with a high pitch versus a low pitch, and accompanied by the same haptic component
(or substantially similar haptic components that a typical user will not be able to differentiate
between), the perception of the haptic component differs despite the identical haptic. The
higher pitched or shrill version of the ring tone might be used with the second output to draw
elevated user attention. In some embodiments, the first haptic output is similar, identical, or
substantially identical to the second haptic output.
[0318]      In some embodiments, the first and second non-haptic components are visual
outputs, such as text, graphic or metadata output.
[0319]      According to some embodiments, the first alert condition and the second alert
condition are in the same class of alert condition, wherein the class is associated with alert
conditions for an application. In this example, all alerts from a respective application fall
within a common class, and classes are differentiated by application. For example, all virtual
assistant events optionally have same haptic component with different audio components. In
                                                - 88 -

another example, incoming and outgoing messages have the same haptic output with different
audio, the same haptic output optionally based on being associated with a common instant
messaging application. The common component (in this example, the haptic component)
identifies the application. In yet another example, events for a personal automated assistant
including confirm, cancel, and invoke events optionally all have the same audio, but differing
haptic outputs.

[0320]      Table 6 shows message received and message sent alert conditions for a
messaging application according to some embodiments. In this example, various modes are
listed for an active application state. In the case of a new message received, as shown in
rows five, six, and seven, a tap-type haptic is output and a message received default audio is
output. In the case of a new message sent, shown in the last row, a tap-type haptic is output,
and a message send default audio is output. Because message received (a first alert
condition) and message sent (the second alert condition) are in the same class of alert
condition in which the class is associated with an application (messaging), the haptic output
for both alert conditions is the same, but the audio output is different. Table 6 provides
conditions and corresponding outputs according to some embodiments, but is merely
exemplary; other combinations of alerts, states, modes, conditions and outputs are used
according to different embodiments.
[0321]      According to some embodiments, the first alert condition and the second alert
condition are in the same class of alert condition, and the class is associated with a category
of applications. For example, classes of application include messaging applications, game
applications, health/fitness applications, productivity applications, or social networking
applications according to some embodiments. In some embodiments, applications that have
or perform common or similar functions optionally belong to a common class of applications.
Examples of classes of applications include, text-based communication applications (instant
messaging, email, social media), voice-based communication applications (phone, voice over
internet), multimedia applications (photo viewer applications, camera application, music
player, video player), text editing applications (word, notepad), scheduling applications
(calendar, alarm), and internet browser applications (chrome, safari). Classes are therefore
differentiated by function across applications according to some embodiments. As one
example, email messages and text messages although belonging to different applications
(email and instant messaging) have the same haptic output and different audio outputs
according to some embodiments, by virtue of being associated with applications that are in
the same class of applications (both text-based communication applications).
[0322]      According to some embodiments, the first alert condition and the second alert
condition are in the same class of alert condition, and the class corresponds to functions in a
predefined class of functions. For example, alerts that report on accomplishment of activity
goals within an activity monitoring application (e.g., goal close, behind on goal, goal
                                                 - 90 -

attained; achieved 10% of target, 50 % of target, etc.) optionally fall within the same class of
alerts. Various alarms or reminders within a same scheduling application can be set for
different predefined time instances, or to report on the satisfaction of various different
predefined criteria according to some embodiments.

[0323]      Table 7 depicts various activity related goals according to some embodiments. In
this example, three different alert conditions belonging to the same alert condition class are
shown: sedentary end timer, activity 50% of target, and activity target reached. The class of
alert conditions shown corresponds to functions in a predefined class of functions of alerts
that report on accomplishment of activity goals within an activity monitoring application.
For each event in the table, the haptic output is a tap-type output, although the audio output
for each different type varies (e.g., default activity chime, no audio, intense activity chime).
Table 7 provides conditions and corresponding outputs according to some embodiments, but

[0324]      According to some embodiments, the first alert condition and the second alert
condition are associated with two different applications, wherein the first alert condition and
the second alert condition are in the same class of alert condition, the class corresponding to
functions in a predefined class of functions within the two different applications. Examples of
predefined classes of functions include, alerts that report on incoming text communication
from another user across applications (incoming email, incoming instant message, incoming
social media message) fall into the same class, alerts that report on incoming voice
communication from another user across all applications (phone, voice over internet, voice
call within an email application) fall into a common class, alerts that report application
software upgrades for all applications fall into a common class, system alerts that report on
various states of the device (Wi-Fi connected/not available, GPS turned on/off, battery life
indicator, device on/off), according to some embodiments.

[0325]      Table 8 includes various software upgrade available alert conditions for four
different application types: calendar, messages, Social Networking, and Game. These alert
conditions each are associated with different applications, but are in the same class of alert
condition corresponding to functions in a predefined class of functions, in this case
                                                - 93 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                            PCT/US2015/041858
application software upgrades for all applications. For each alert condition, a haptic of buzz
tap is output. Some of the alert conditions also have a non-haptic output. In the case of
social networking or gaming applications, the haptic output is complimented by a pop-up
type notification. Table 8 provides conditions and corresponding outputs according to some
embodiments, but is merely exemplary; other combinations of alerts, states, modes,
conditions and outputs are used according to different embodiments.
[0326]       According to some embodiments, when the first alert condition and the second
alert condition are different alert conditions that are in a same class of alert condition, the
first haptic component of the first output is identical (or substantially identical) to the second
haptic component of the second output, and the first non-haptic component (e.g., audio or
visual) of the first output is different from the second non-haptic component of the second
output. Each of the examples of Tables 4, 5, and 6 above fall into this category, as they each
share a common haptic component and differing non-haptic components. In some
embodiments, "identical" haptic components are haptic components that are generated based
on same haptic output instructions delivered to a haptic output generator, even if the haptic
output generator (sometimes an analog component) generates haptic outputs that are slightly
different (even while being substantially perceptually identical to a typical user). In some
embodiments, the audio components may share attributes, but still differ. For example, the
same ringtone or musical notes played in different pitches or using different musical
instruments. Overlaying different audio (e.g., high vs low pitch, same audio played in
metallic vs. glass vs. ceramic tones) on the same haptic output creates different perceptions.
In some embodiments, different haptic components are haptic components that are generated
based on different haptic output instructions delivered to a haptic output generator so as to
produce haptic outputs that are perceptually differentiable by a typical user).
[0327]       According to some embodiments, the opposite correlation applies for haptic
versus non-haptic similarities and differences in their respective outputs. When the first alert
condition and the second alert condition are different alert conditions that are in a same class
of alert condition, the first non-haptic component of the first output is identical (or
substantially identical) to the second non-haptic component of the second output, and the first
haptic component of the first output is different from the second haptic component of the
second output.

[0328]       When the first alert condition and the second alert condition correspond to a same
alert condition, the first output is accompanied by a first additional component that is
different from a second additional component that accompanies the second output according
to some embodiments. For example, a first and a second incoming instant message both are
incoming instant messages, and therefore are the same alert condition. In this example, the
first additional component is unique to a first event that triggered the first alert condition, and
the second additional component is unique to a second event that triggered the second alert
condition, e.g., the additional component of the first incoming instant message includes a
visual component (text, metadata, graphic) that is unique to the first instant message (e.g.,
name of sender, contact information of the sender, body/content of the message) according to
some embodiments. Likewise, the additional component of the second incoming instant
message includes a visual component (text, metadata, graphic) that is unique to the second
instant message (e.g., name of sender, contact information of the sender, body/content of the
message). The first additional component accompanying the first output optionally provides
information (e.g., textual information) describing the first event that triggered the first alert
(e.g., a snippet of the message or text version of the automated assistant response), and the
second additional component accompanying the second output provides information (e.g.,
textual information) describing the second event that triggered the second alert according to
some embodiments.
[0329]       According to some embodiments, after providing 1320 the second output, the
device 100 detects 1325 occurrence of a third alert condition, and responsive to detecting the
occurrence of the third alert condition, provides 1330 a third output that includes a third
haptic component and a third non-haptic component. When the first alert condition, the
second alert condition, and the third alert condition are different alert conditions that are in a
same class of alert condition, the first output, the second output, and the third output
optionally share one or more same components and have one or more different components.
When the third alert condition is in a different class of alert condition from the first alert
condition and the second alert condition, the third haptic component optionally is different
from both the first haptic component and the second haptic component and the third non
haptic component optionally is different from both the first non-haptic component and the
second non-haptic component. Alternatively, when the first alert condition, the second alert
condition, and the third alert condition are different alert conditions that are in the same class

of alert condition, and the first, second, and third outputs have one or more components in
common (e.g., haptic, non-haptic) and when the third alert condition is in a different class of
alert condition from the first alert condition and the second alert condition, the third haptic
output has no common components with the first output and the second output, according to
some embodiments.
[0330]      It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in Figure
13 have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate that the described
order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of ordinary skill in
the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations described herein.
Additionally, it should be noted that details of other processes described herein with respect
to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 700, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 2500, 2600,
3000, and 3200) are also applicable in an analogous manner to method 1300 described above
with respect to Figure 13. For example, the inputs, alert conditions, applications, and haptic
outputs described above with reference to method 1300 optionally have one or more of the
characteristics of the inputs, alert conditions, applications, and haptic outputs described
herein with reference to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 700, 900, 1000, 1100,
1200 , 2500, 2600, 3000, and 3200). For brevity, these details are not repeated here.
[0331]      The operations described above with reference to Figures 7, 9-13 are, optionally,
implemented by components depicted in Figures 1A-IB, and 14-19. For example, receiving
input, detecting alert conditions, determining states, determining alert condition triggers,
providing haptic and audio output , and performing operations, are, optionally implemented
by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in
event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher
module 174 delivers the event information to application 136-1. A respective event
recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event information to respective event
definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a first location on the touch
sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as selection of an
object on a user interface. When a respective predefined event or sub-event is detected, event
recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the detection of the event or
sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally utilizes or calls data updater 176 or object updater
177 to update the application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190
accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application.

Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes
can be implemented based on the components depicted in Figures 1A-1B and 14-19.
[0332]       As mentioned above, the operations described with reference to Figures 7 and 9
13 are optionally implemented by components depicted in Figures 14-19. Figure 14 shows an
example functional block diagram of device 100 configured in accordance with the principles
of the various described embodiments. It is understood by persons of skill in the art that the
functional blocks described in Figure 14 are, optionally, combined or separated into sub
blocks to implement the principles of the various described embodiments. Therefore, the
description herein optionally supports any possible combination or separation or further
definition of the functional blocks described herein.
[0333]       As shown in Figure 14, the device 100 includes a display unit 1401 configured to
display an application, a touch-sensitive surface unit 1403 configured to receive user
contacts, and a processing unit 1405 coupled to the display unit 1401 and the touch-sensitive
surface unit 1403. In some embodiments, the processing unit 1405 includes a detecting unit
1410, a state determining unit 1415, a haptic providing unit 1420, an engagement
determining unit 1425, and output determining unit 1430.
[0334]       The processing unit 1405 is configured to detect an alert condition associated with
an application executing on the computing device (e.g., with the detecting unit 1410). The
processing unit 1405 also is configured to determine a state associated with the application at
a time associated with the alert condition responsive to detecting the alert condition (e.g.,
with the state determining unit 1415). In accordance with a determination that the
application was in an active state at the time associated with the alert condition, the
processing unit 1405 provides a first haptic output (e.g., with the haptic providing unit 1420)
that represents the occurrence of the alert condition, the first haptic output having a first set
of output characteristics and in accordance with a determination that the application was in an
inactive state at the time associated with the alert condition, providing a second haptic output
(e.g., with the haptic providing unit 1420) that represents the occurrence of the alert
condition, the second haptic output having a second set of output characteristics, wherein the
second haptic output is different from the first haptic output.
[0335]       The following paragraphs [0335]-[0347] describe different embodiments that may
be implemented, individually or in any combination, by the device 100 illustrated in Figure
14:

[0336]      The processing unit 1405 determines the state associated with the application at a
time associated with the alert condition by determining whether a user interface for the
application was displayed on a touchscreen of the device at the time associated with the alert
condition (e.g., with the state determining unit 1415).
[0337]      The processing unit 1405 determines the state associated with the application at a
time associated with the alert condition by determining whether a user input to the
application triggered the alert condition (e.g., with the state determining unit 1415), with the
user interaction being different from the alert condition.
[0338]      If the application was in the active state based on a detected user interaction at the
time of the alert condition and the processing unit 1405 determines a level of user
engagement associated with the user interaction at the time of the alert condition (e.g., with
the engagement determination unit 1425) and determines one or more of the first set of output
characteristics for the first haptic output based on the determined level of engagement (e.g.,
with the output determining unit).
[0339]      The processing unit 1405 determining that the application was in the active state
comprises determining that the application was executing in the foreground on the
computing device at the time associated with the alert condition. The processing unit 1405
determining that the application was in the inactive state comprises determining that the
application was not executing on the computing device or was executing in the background
on the computing device at the time associated with the alert condition.
[0340]      The display unit 1401 displays a respective user interface window corresponding
to the application concurrently with one or more other user interface windows on a multi
application-window user interface on the device. The processing unit 1405 determines
whether the respective user interface window corresponding to the application was displayed
in the foreground of the multi-application-window user interface at the time associated with
the alert condition (e.g., with the state determining unit 1415).
[0341]      The display unit 1401 displays one or more other user interface windows are
concurrently on a multi-application-window user interface on the device at the time
associated with the alert condition and the processing unit 1405 determines the state
associated with the application (e.g., with the state determining unit 1415) at the time
associated with the alert condition comprises determining whether a respective user interface

window corresponding to the application was displayed in the multi-application-window user
interface at the time associated with the alert condition.
[0342]      In some embodiments, the alert condition corresponds to an event that is
automatically triggered by the application, an automatically initiated event notification
received by the application from a source external to the device, or a manually initiated event
notification received by the application from a human user other than a user of operating the
device.
[0343]      The processing unit 1405 provides output (e.g., with output determining unit
1430) comprising a first haptic output accompanied by a first audio output and a second
haptic output accompanied by a second audio output, with the first haptic output being
identical to the second haptic output and the first audio output being different from the
second audio output. Alternatively, the processing unit 1405 provides output (e.g., with
output determining unit 1430) comprising a first haptic output accompanied by an audio
output and the second haptic output accompanied by the same audio output, with the first
haptic output being different from the second haptic output.
[0344]      The processing unit 1405 accompanies the second haptic output by an audio
output, a waveform of the second haptic output generated based on, mirroring, and
synchronized to a waveform of the accompanying audio output. The processing unit 1405
provides output (e.g., with output determining unit 1430) comprising a first haptic output not
accompanied by audio output and a second haptic output accompanied by an audio output. In
some embodiments, the first haptic output is similar to the second haptic output. In some
embodiments, the second haptic output has a greater intensity than the first haptic output.
[0345]      The first set of characteristics of the haptic output (e.g., provided by output
determining unit 1430) comprises one or more of: an amplitude, a duration, a regularity, a
repetition frequency, or a selection of haptic features of the first haptic output. In some
embodiments, the second haptic output is different and has a greater intensity than the first
haptic output.
[0346]      The processing unit 1405 determines a state of the computing device (e.g., with
the state determining unit) at the time associated with the alert condition by determining that
the computing device was active at the time associated with the alert condition, and
determining that the application was in the inactive state comprises determining that the

[0350]      As shown in Figure 15, the device 100 includes a display unit 1501 configured to
display an application, a touch-sensitive surface unit 1503 configured to receive user
contacts, and a processing unit 1505 coupled to the display unit 1501 and the touch-sensitive
surface unit 1503. In some embodiments, the processing unit 1505 includes a detecting unit
1510, a trigger determining unit 1515, a haptic providing unit 1520, an external event
determining unit 1525, an output variant providing unit 1530, an urgency determining unit
1535, a contextual determining unit 1540, a modulating unit 1545, and a personal
communication determining unit 1550.
[0351]      The processing unit 1505 is configured to detect occurrence of an alert condition
associated with an application (e.g., with detecting unit 1510), and responsive to detecting the
occurrence of the alert condition, determine whether the alert condition was triggered by a
manually-initiated event (e.g., with trigger determining unit 1515). In accordance with a
determination that the alert condition was triggered by a manually-initiated event, the
processing unit 1505 provides a first haptic output (e.g., with haptic providing unit 1520)
corresponding to a manually-initiated event notification in accordance with a determination
that the alert condition was triggered by an automatically-initiated event, the processing unit
1505 provides a second haptic output (e.g., with haptic providing unit 1520) corresponding to
an automatically-initiated event notification, wherein the second haptic output is different
from the first haptic output.
[0352]      The following paragraphs [0353]-[0364] describe different embodiments that may
be implemented, individually or in any combination, by the device 100 illustrated in Figure
15:
[0353]      The processing unit 1505 determines that the alert condition was triggered by a
manually-initiated event by determining whether the alert condition corresponds to an event
initiated by a human user (e.g., with trigger determining unit 1515), according to some
embodiments. In some embodiments, the processing unit 1505 determines that the alert
condition was triggered by a manually-initiated event by determining whether the alert
condition corresponds to an event initiated by a human user other than a user of the
computing device (e.g., with trigger determining unit 1515).
[0354]      The processing unit 1505 determines that the alert condition was triggered by a
manually-initiated event by determining whether the alert condition corresponds to an input
received from a human user (e.g., with trigger determining unit 1515), the input identifying a

user of the computing device and the input comprising an indication from the human user to
alert the user of the computing device as to the input, according to some embodiments.
[0355]      The processing unit 1505 determines whether the alert condition was
automatically triggered by the application or was an automatically-initiated event notification
received by the application from a source external to the device (e.g., with trigger
determining unit 1515), according to some embodiments. Alternatively, the processing unit
1505 determines that the alert condition was triggered by an automatically-initiated event by
determining that the alert condition occurs at predetermined time or reports on satisfaction of
a predetermined triggering condition (e.g., with trigger determining unit 1515).
[0356]      In accordance with a determination that the alert condition was triggered by an
automatically-initiated event, the processing unit 1505 determines whether the automatically
initiated event corresponds to an automatically-initiated event occurring external to the
device (e.g., with external event determining unit 1525), according to some embodiments. In
accordance with a determination that the automatically-initiated event corresponds to an
event occurring external to the device, the processing unit 1505 provides a first variant of the
second haptic output (e.g., with the output variant providing unit 1530), corresponding to a
notification of an externally occurring automatically-initiated event. In accordance with a
determination that the automatically-initiated event corresponds to an event initiated within
the device, the processing unit 1505 provides a second variant of the second haptic output
corresponding to a notification of an internally generated automatically-initiated event (e.g.,
with the output variant providing unit 1530).
[0357]      In accordance with a determination that the alert condition was triggered by a
manually-initiated event, he processing unit 1505 determines a measure of urgency
associated with the manually-initiated event (e.g., with urgency determining unit 1535), and
modulates an intensity of the first haptic output based on the measure of urgency (e.g., with
modulating unit 1545), according to some embodiments. In accordance with a determination
that the alert condition was triggered by a manually-initiated event, the processing unit 1505
according to some embodiments determines one or more contextual attributes associated with
the manually-initiated event (e.g., with contextual determining unit 1540), and modulates an
intensity of the first haptic output based on the one or more contextual attributes (e.g., with
the modulating unit 1545), according to some embodiments.

[0358]       In accordance with a determination that the alert condition was triggered by an
automatically-initiated event, the processing unit 1505 analyzes characteristics associated
with the alert condition to determine one or more contextual attributes associated with the
automatically-initiated event (e.g., with contextual determining unit 1540), and modulates an
intensity the second output based on the one or more contextual attributes (e.g., with the
modulating unit 1545), according to some embodiments.
[0359]       In accordance with a determination that the alert condition was triggered by an
automatically-initiated event, the processing unit 1505 determines a time-varying measure of
urgency associated with the automatically-initiated event (e.g., with urgency determining unit
1535), and modulates, over a specified window of time, an intensity of the second haptic
output to indicate the time-varying measure of urgency (e.g., with modulating unit 154),
according to some embodiments.
[0360]       In some embodiments, the first haptic output is accompanied by a first audio
output and the second haptic output is accompanied by a second audio output, the first haptic
output is similar to the second haptic output, and the first audio output is different from the
second audio output. In some embodiments, the first haptic output is accompanied by a first
audio output and the second haptic output is accompanied by a second audio output, the first
audio output is similar to the second audio output, and the first haptic output is different from
the second haptic output. In some embodiments, the first haptic output is accompanied by a
first audio output and the second haptic output is not accompanies by an audio output. The
first haptic output optionally is similar to the second haptic output.
[0361]       The first haptic output that corresponds to the manually-initiated event
notification is more intense than the second haptic output that corresponds to the
automatically-initiated event notification, according to some embodiments. In some
circumstances, the first haptic output is characterized by a first set of characteristics
comprising one or more of: an amplitude of the first haptic output, a duration of the first
haptic output, a regularity associated with the first haptic output, repetition frequency of
haptic features in the first haptic output, and a selection of haptic features constituting the
first haptic output, and the second haptic output is characterized by a second set of
characteristics comprising one or more of: an amplitude of the second haptic output, a
duration of the second haptic output, a regularity associated with the second haptic output,

[0362]      The processing unit 1505 detects a first alert condition corresponding to an
incoming email message from a first human sender (e.g., with the detecting unit 1510),
according to some embodiments. Responsive to determining that the incoming email
message corresponds to a manually-initiated event, the processing unit 1505 provides the first
haptic output (e.g., with haptic providing unit 1520). The processing unit 1505 detects a
second alert condition corresponding to an incoming text message from a second human
sender (e.g., with the detecting unit 1510), and responsive to determining that the incoming
text message corresponds to a manually-initiated event, provides the first haptic output (e.g.,
with haptic providing unit 1520).
[0363]      In some embodiments, the device has a touch-sensitive display (e.g., provided by
touch-sensitive surface unit 1503), and the first haptic output and the second haptic output are
provided via a touch-sensitive display on the computing device (e.g., with haptic providing
unit 1520).

an application (e.g., with the detecting unit 1510), according to some embodiments, and
responsive to detecting the occurrence of the alert condition, determines whether the alert
condition corresponds to a personal communication from a sender in a list of contacts
associated with the user (e.g., with personal communication determining unit 1550). In
accordance with a determination that the alert condition corresponds to a personal
communication from a sender in a list of contacts associated with the user, the processing
unit 1505 provides a first haptic output corresponding to a personal alert notification (e.g.,
with haptic providing unit 1520), and in accordance with a determination that the alert
condition does not correspond to a personal communication from a sender in a list of contacts
associated with the user, the processing unit 1505 provides a second haptic output
corresponding to an automatic alert notification (e.g., with haptic providing unit 1520),
wherein the first haptic output is greater in magnitude than the second haptic output.
[0365]      As mentioned above, the operations described with reference to Figures 7 and 9
13 are optionally implemented by components depicted in Figures 14-19. Figure 16 shows an

computing device associated with receiving user input to an application (e.g., with the
detecting unit 1610), and responsive to detecting the first alert condition, provides a first
haptic output having a first intensity and corresponding to the user input to the application
(e.g., with the output providing unit 1615). After providing the first haptic output, the
processing unit 1605 detects a second alert condition associated with receiving a
predetermined system event in the application (e.g., with the detecting unit 1610), and
responsive to detecting the second alert condition, provides a second haptic output having a
second intensity (e.g., with the output providing unit 1615), and corresponding to the
predetermined system event, wherein the second intensity is greater than the first intensity.
[0368]       The following paragraphs [039]-[0386] describe different embodiments that may
be implemented, individually or in any combination, by the device 100 illustrated in Figure

haptic output, the processing unit 1605 modifies the first haptic output (e.g., with the output

[0371]       In some embodiments, after detecting a respective alert condition, the processing
unit 1605 determines that the respective alert condition resulted from a respective user input
received on the computing device and identifies a measure of user engagement associated
with the detected user input (e.g., with the engagement measuring unit 1630). The processing
unit 1605 modulates the first signal intensity of the first haptic output based on the measure
of user engagement (e.g., with the output modifying unit 1625).
[0372]       In some embodiments, after detecting a respective alert condition, the processing
unit 1605 determines that the respective alert condition resulted from receiving a tactile user
input on the device (e.g., with the tactile input determining unit 1635), and identifies a
location of receiving the tactile user input on the device. The processing unit 1605 modulates
a spatial haptic energy profile of the first haptic output, by providing greater than a specified
proportion of haptic energy of the first haptic output within a specified radius threshold of the
location of receiving the tactile user input on the device (e.g., with the output modifying unit
1625).
[0373]       In some embodiments, after detecting a respective alert condition, the processing
unit 1605 determines that the respective alert condition resulted from receiving a tactile user

1625), by reducing the amplitude of haptic energy of the first haptic output such that it is
perceptible at the location of receiving the tactile user input on the device. The location of
receiving the tactile user input on the device can vary with time, and the spatial haptic energy
can varies with time corresponding to the time-varying location of receiving the tactile user
input.
[0374]       In some embodiments, after detecting a respective alert condition, the processing
unit 1605 determines that the respective alert condition resulted from receiving a tactile user
input, and identifies time-varying morphological attributes of the tactile user input (e.g., with
the tactile input determining unit 1635). The processing unit 1605 modifies, over time,
morphological characteristics of the first haptic output to mimic the time-varying
morphological attributes of the tactile user input (e.g., with the output modifying unit 1625).

unit 1605 determines that the respective alert condition resulted from a sustained user input
(e.g., with the tactile input determining unit 1635), and responsive to the determining,
initiates the first haptic output at an initiation time of the sustained user input (e.g., with the
output providing unit 1615). The processing unit 1605 detects termination of the sustained
user input, and terminates the first haptic output at a termination time of the sustained user
input (e.g., with the output terminating unit 1640).

modulation condition exists (e.g., with the ambient condition determining unit 1645), and
responsive to determining that an ambient condition-based modulation condition exists, prior
to providing the second haptic output, modifies the second haptic output (e.g., with the output
modifying unit 1625).

a respective application, the processing unit 1605 determines that the respective alert
condition did not result from receiving user input, and responsive to determining that the
respective alert condition did not result from receiving user input, the processing unit 1605
determines whether one or more ambient conditions exist for the device as potential
interference to haptic output at a time of occurrence of the respective alert condition (e.g.,
with the ambient condition determining unit 1645). In accordance with a determination that
no interferential ambient conditions exist for the device, the processing unit 1605 provides a
respective second haptic output based on the state of receptiveness of the user (e.g., with the
output providing unit 1615). In accordance with a determination that one or more ambient

[0396]       In some embodiments, the inputs corresponding to the first and second parts of the
multi-part operation comprise a single gesture, wherein the input corresponding to the first
part of the multi-part operation is an initial part of the gesture, and the input corresponding to
the second part of the multi-part operation is a subsequent part of the gesture. According to
some embodiments, the gesture is initiated on a portion of the touch-sensitive surface that
corresponds to a first location in a user interface displayed on a display of the device and

operation initiates an event associated with the respective application, and the event is
sustained until receipt of the input corresponding to the second part of the multi-part
operation, and the input corresponding to the second part of the multi-part operation
terminates the event associated with the respective application (e.g., with the ongoing output
termination unit 1720).
[0398]      According to some embodiments, the application is a text editing application, and
the input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation is a selection of a first user
interface element that enables a text-entry mode of the text editing application. The multi
part operation comprises one or more inputs for text-entry to the text editing application and

operation follows the input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation and is
separated in time from the input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation by
a specified interval of time corresponding to a duration of the event, and the ongoing haptic
output sequence is provided throughout the duration of the event and indicates occurrence of
the event. Characteristics of the ongoing haptic output sequence optionally are selected based
on the event that is initiated by the input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part
operation.

[0401]       In some embodiments, the processing unit 1705 provides a first haptic feedback
responsive to receiving the input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation
(e.g., with the feedback providing unit 1725), the first haptic feedback selected based on the
event and indicating an initiation of the event, the first haptic feedback distinct from the
ongoing haptic output sequence. The processing unit 1705 further provides a second haptic
feedback responsive to receiving the input corresponding to the second part of the multi-part
operation (e.g., with the feedback providing unit 1725), the second haptic feedback distinct
from than the ongoing haptic output sequence.
[0402]       The input corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation suspends an
ongoing event associated with the application, and the input corresponding to the second part
of the multi-part operation resumes the ongoing event associated with the application,
according to some embodiments.
[0403]       In some embodiments, the application is a voice communication application, and
the event is an ongoing voice communication occurring at a time of receipt of the input
corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation. In some embodiments, the input
corresponding to the first part of the multi-part operation is a selection of a first user interface
element of the voice communication application, the selection suspending the ongoing voice
communication, and the input corresponding to the second part of the multi-part operation is
a selection of a second user interface element that resumes the voice communication.
[0404]       In some embodiments, after initiating an ongoing haptic output sequence
responsive to the first part of a multi-part operation and before receiving an input that
corresponds to a second part of the multi-part operation, the processing unit 1705 receives
one or more additional user inputs (e.g., with the additional input receiving unit 1730),
distinct from the input that corresponds to the second part of the multi-part operation. The
processing unit 1705 continues to provide the ongoing haptic output regardless of the
additional user inputs (e.g., with the ongoing output initiating unit 1715), until receipt of the
input corresponding to the second part of the multi-part operation.       In some embodiments,
the intensity of the ongoing haptic output sequence increases with time until a subsequent
input corresponding to the multi-part operation is received.
[0405]       According to some embodiments, responsive to detecting the input corresponding
to the first part of the multi-part operation (e.g., with the input receiving unit 1710), the
processing unit 1705 initiates an ongoing audio output sequence to accompany the ongoing

detecting the input corresponding to the second part of the multi-part operation (e.g., with the
input receiving unit 1710), terminating the ongoing the audio output sequence (e.g., with the
ongoing output termination unit 1720).
[0406]      In some embodiments, a time-varying haptic energy profile of the haptic output
sequence mimics a time-varying acoustic energy profile of the audio output sequence. In
some circumstances, responsive to determining that the input corresponding to the first part
of the multi-part operation does not pause an ongoing event, but initiates an event associated
with the respective application, the processing unit 1705 provides the haptic output sequence
without an accompanying audio output sequence (e.g., with the ongoing output initiating unit
1715), and responsive to determining that the input corresponding to the first part of the
multi-part operation pauses an ongoing event associated with the respective application, the
processing unit 1705 provides an ongoing audio output sequence accompanying the ongoing
haptic output sequence (e.g., with the ongoing output initiating unit 1715).

functional blocks described in Figure 19 are, optionally, combined or separated into sub
blocks to implement the principles of the various described embodiments. Therefore, the
description herein optionally supports any possible combination or separation or further
definition of the functional blocks described herein.
[0422]      As shown in Figure 19, the device 100 includes a display unit 1901 configured to
display an application, a touch-sensitive surface unit 1903 configured to receive user
contacts, and a processing unit 1905 coupled to the display unit 1901 and the touch-sensitive
surface unit 1903. In some embodiments, the processing unit 1905 includes an alert
condition detecting unit 1910 and an output providing unit 1915.
[0423]      The processing unit 1905 is configured to detect occurrence of a first alert
condition (e.g., with the alert condition detecting unit 1910), and responsive to detecting the
occurrence of the first alert condition, provide a first output that includes a first haptic
component and a first non-haptic component (e.g., with the output providing unit 1915).
After providing the first output, the processing unit 1905 is configured to detect occurrence
of a second alert condition (e.g., with the alert condition detecting unit 1910), and responsive
to detecting the occurrence of the second alert condition, providing a second output that
includes a second haptic component and a second non-haptic component (e.g., with the
output providing unit 1915). If the first alert condition and the second alert condition are
different alert conditions that are in a same class of alert condition, the first output and the
second output share one or more same components and have one or more different
components, and if the first alert condition and the second alert condition are different alert
conditions that are in different classes of alert condition, the first haptic component is
different from the second haptic component and the first non-haptic component is different
from the second non-haptic component.

[0424]       The following paragraphs [0425]-[043 1] describe different embodiments that may
be implemented, individually or in any combination, by the device 100 illustrated in Figure
19:
[0425]       In some embodiments, the first alert condition and the second alert condition are
in the same class of alert condition, wherein the class is associated with alert conditions for
an application. In some embodiments, the first alert condition and the second alert condition
are in the same class of alert condition, the class associated with a category of applications.
In some embodiments, the first alert condition and the second alert condition are associated
with two different applications, wherein the first alert condition and the second alert
condition are in the same class of alert condition, the class corresponding to functions in a
predefined class of functions within the two different applications. According to some
embodiments, the first alert condition and the second alert condition are associated with a
common application, wherein the first alert condition and the second alert condition are in the
same class of alert condition, the class corresponding to functions in a predefined class of
functions.
[0426]       In some embodiments, the classes of alert conditions include messages, activity
alerts, media playback alerts, virtual assistant alerts, system alerts, scheduling reminders, and
internet browser updates. In some embodiments, the first alert condition and the second alert
condition correspond to separate instances of the same alert condition, the first output is
identical to the second output. According to some embodiments, the first and second non
haptic components are audio outputs. According to some embodiments, the first and second
non-haptic components are visual outputs.
[0427]       In some embodiments, when the first alert condition and the second alert
condition are different alert conditions that are in a same class of alert condition, the first
haptic component of the first output is identical to the second haptic component of the second
output, and the first non-haptic component of the first output is different from the second
non-haptic component of the second output. In some embodiments, when the first alert
condition and the second alert condition are different alert conditions that are in a same class
of alert condition, the first non-haptic component of the first output is identical to the second
non-haptic component of the second output, and the first haptic component of the first output
is different from the second haptic component of the second output.

[0428]      According to some embodiments, the first alert condition and the second alert
condition correspond to a same alert condition, and the first output is accompanied by a first
additional component that is different from a second additional component that accompanies
the second output.
[0429]      In some embodiments, the first additional component accompanying the first
output provides information describing the first event that triggered the first alert, and the
second additional component accompanying the second output provides information
describing the second event that triggered the second alert.
[0430]      In some embodiments, after providing the second output, the processing unit 1905
detects occurrence of a third alert condition (e.g., with the alert condition detecting unit
1910), and responsive to detecting the occurrence of the third alert condition, provides a third
output that includes a third haptic component and a third non-haptic component (e.g., with
the output providing unit 1915), wherein when the first alert condition, the second alert
condition, and the third alert condition are different alert conditions that are in a same class of
alert condition, the first output, the second output, and the third output share one or more
same components and have one or more different components, and when the third alert
condition is in a different class of alert condition from the first alert condition and the second
alert condition, the third haptic component is different from both the first haptic component
and the second haptic component and the third non-haptic component is different from both
the first non-haptic component and the second non-haptic component.
[0431]      In some embodiments, the computing device has a touch-sensitive display (e.g.,
with the touch-sensitive surface unit) and the first haptic component of the first output and
the second haptic component of the second output are provided via the touch-sensitive
display on the computing device (e.g., with the output providing unit 1915).
Hardware Specifications
[0432]      In certain embodiments, the device 100 may include one or more acoustic
modules 2006 for transmitting and receiving acoustic energy, shown in simplified schematic
form. The acoustic module 2006 may be a speaker or microphone of an electronic device, as
non-limiting examples.
[0433]        As shown in Figure 20, the device housing includes a first acoustic port 2020
that is coupled to the acoustic module 2006. In some instances, the acoustic module 2006 is
configured to function as either a microphone or a speaker element for the device 100.
                                                - 121  -

    WO 2016/036447                                                            PCT/US2015/041858
However, for the purposes of the following description, the acoustic module 2006 is
described as a speaker element or module. The acoustic port 2020 includes orifices 2031,
2032 that facilitate the transmission of audible signals from acoustic module 2006 to the
user's ear. In this example, the orifices extend through the housing 101 and acoustically
connect internal components of the acoustic module with the external environment. In other
examples, a single acoustic port may include multiple orifices or a single orifice. In some
embodiments, the acoustic port 2020 may also include a housing structure 2021 ("umbrella"),
screen mesh 2015 or other protective element configured to inhibit ingress of liquid or other
foreign matter.
[0434]      The umbrella structure 2021 generally prevents water or fluid 2001 from directly
impacting the acoustic module 2006. In one example, the acoustic port 2001 includes one or
more orifices or openings 2031, 2032 that are offset with respect to an acoustic chamber of
the module (e.g., the space between umbrella 2021 and mesh 2015 and including orifices
2031, 2032). The umbrella structure may be formed into the outer surface of the case or
housing 101. For example, the umbrella structure 2021 may be formed from the material
located between two or more orifices or openings 2031, 2032 that are offset with respect to
the acoustic chamber.
[0435]      Further, certain embodiments may shape the acoustic chamber to reduce the
likelihood that water accumulates in the chamber or other portion of the orifice. A screen
2015 may separate the acoustic cavity 2011 from the external environment and may impede
the ingress of liquids or other foreign material from the external environment into the
acoustic cavity 2011. For example, the sidewalls of the orifice(s) 2031, 2032 may extend
substantially to the surface of the screen 2015 in order to reduce surface tension of water in
the orifice or chamber. Likewise, an exterior of the orifice may be chamfered to reduce
surface tension of a liquid adjacent the orifice and thus facilitate liquid removal.
[0436]      In the present example depicted in Figure 20, the acoustic module 2006 is a
speaker module. As shown in Figure 20, a speaker acoustic module includes various
components for producing and transmitting sound, including a diaphragm 2010, a voice coil
2009, a center magnet 2008, and side magnets/coils 2007. In a typical implementation, the
diaphragm 2010 is configured to produce sound waves or an acoustic signal in response to a
stimulus signal in the voice coil 2009. That is, a modulated stimulus signal in the voice coil
2009 causes movement of the diaphragm 2010. Movement of the diaphragm 2010 creates
                                               - 122 -

   WO 2016/036447                                                          PCT/US2015/041858
sound waves, which propagate through the acoustic cavity 2011 of acoustic module 2006 and
eventually out the port 2020 to the exterior environment. In some cases, the acoustic cavity
106 functions as an acoustical resonator having a shape and size that is configured to amplify
and/or dampen sound waves produced by movement of the diaphragm 2010.
[0437]      In certain embodiments, the acoustic module 2006 also includes structural support
elements, such as an end wall 2013 and base 2014. These elements may provide physical
support for the speaker elements; various yokes, connectors and the like may also provide
such support. Certain embodiments may include a gasket 2016 to seal the interior of the
device against the environment. It should be appreciated that the structure recited herein is
meant as an example and not a limitation. For example, in alternative embodiments, the
acoustic cavity may be formed from additional components or may be formed from a single
component.
[0438]      The acoustic module 2006 depicted in Figure 20 is provided as one example of a
type of speaker acoustic module; some embodiments may use different types of speakers,
microphones and the like. Further, although described in the context of a speaker, the
foregoing is equally applicable to a microphone and many embodiments may likewise
incorporate a microphone.
[0439]      Embodiments described herein may include one or more sensors for detecting the
location of a touch. In particular, a touch sensor may be disposed relative to the display of a
wearable electronic device to form a touch-sensitive surface. The following description is
provided with respect to individual touch sensors that may be used to determine the location
of a touch.
[0440]      In one embodiment, the device may include self-capacitive touch sensors that may
be formed from an array of self-capacitive pixels or electrodes. Figure 2 1A depicts an
example touch sensor circuit corresponding to a self-capacitance touch pixel electrode and
sensing circuit. Touch sensor circuit 2109 can have a touch pixel electrode 2102 with an
inherent self-capacitance to ground associated with it, and also an additional self-capacitance
to ground that can be formed when an object, such as finger 2112, is in proximity to or
touching the touch pixel electrode 2102. The total self-capacitance to ground of touch pixel
electrode 2102 can be illustrated as capacitance 2104. Touch pixel electrode 2102 can be
coupled to sensing circuit 2114. Sensing circuit 2114 can include an operational amplifier
2108, feedback resistor 2116, feedback capacitor 2110 and an input voltage source 2106,
                                               - 123 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                          PCT/US2015/041858
although other configurations can be employed. For example, feedback resistor 2116 can be
replaced by a switch capacitor resistor. Touch pixel electrode 2102 can be coupled to the
inverting input of operational amplifier 2108. An AC voltage source 2106 can be coupled to
the non-inverting input of operational amplifier 2108. Touch sensor circuit 2109 can be
configured to sense changes in the total self-capacitance 2104 of touch pixel electrode 2102
induced by finger 2112 either touching or in proximity to the touch sensor panel. Output
2120 can be used by a processor to determine a presence of a proximity or touch event, or the
output can be inputted into a discreet logic network to determine the presence of a touch or
proximity event.
[0441]       Figure 21B depicts an example self-capacitance touch sensor 2130. Touch sensor
2130 can include a plurality of touch pixel electrodes 2102 disposed on a surface and coupled
to sense channels in touch controller 2106, can be driven by stimulation signals from the
sense channels through drive/sense interface 2125, and can be sensed by the sense channels
through the drive/sense interface 2125 as well. After touch controller 2106 has determined
an amount of touch detected at each touch pixel electrode 2102, the pattern of touch pixels in
the touch screen panel at which touch occurred can be thought of as an "image" of touch
(e.g., a pattern of objects touching or in close proximity to the touch screen). The
arrangement of the touch pixel electrodes 2102 in Figure 21 B is provided as one example,
however, the arrangement and/or the geometry of the touch pixel electrodes may vary
depending on the embodiment.
[0442]       Certain embodiments may employ different touch-sensing mechanisms. For
example, certain embodiments may use a mutual-capacitance sensor array to detect a touch.
Some embodiments may use a resistive touch sensor, an optical touch sensor, or any
combination of any touch-sensing technology discussed herein. Accordingly, although self
capacitive touch sensing is described in some detail, it should be understood and appreciated
that references herein to touch sensing and the like are intended to cover the detection of a
touch regardless of the particular type of touch sensor used in any given embodiment.
[0443]       In certain embodiments, an electronic device may include one or more haptic
modules for providing haptic feedback to the user. The embodiments described herein may
relate to or take the form of one or more haptic actuators suitable to provide perceivable
haptic feedback. Such actuators may include an electromagnetic coil, a permanent magnet or
other magnetic field source. The magnetic field may induce motion in a mass of the haptic
                                                - 124 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                           PCT/US2015/041858
actuator by exerting a Lorentz force on the mass when the coil is energized. A direction of
current through the coil determines the direction of motion of the mass, while the strength of
the magnetic field determines the velocity of the mass and thus the magnitude of the haptic
output.
[0444]      In general, haptic actuators implemented in some embodiments may be configured
to maximize or enhance resultant mechanical energy, given a very compact form factor of the
electronic device.
[0445]      In one embodiment and as shown in Figures 22A-22B, the haptic actuator 2450
may have a mass at least partially disposed within the coil 2200 when the mass is in a rest
state. This mass may include two magnets 2211, 2212 of opposing polarities implemented as
a magnet array affixed within a frame 2260; the frame 2260 may provide extra weight to the
mass and thus a stronger haptic output may be generated. A center block 2270 may separate
the magnets, although this is optional. A shaft 2250 may extend through the mass such that
the mass may freely slide on the shaft.
[0446]      The magnet array (formed from the magnets 2211, 2212 and center block 2270)
may generate a radial magnetic field (see Figure 22B) that interacts with the magnetic field of
the coil 2200 when the coil is energized by a current. The Lorentz force resulting from the
interaction of the magnetic fields causes the mass to move along the shaft 2250 in a first
direction. Reversing current flow through the coil 2200 reverses the Lorentz force. As a
result, the magnetic field or force on the magnets 2211, 2212 is also reversed and the mass
may move in a second direction. Thus, mass may move in both directions along the shaft,
depending on the direction of current flow through the coil. Passing an alternating current
through the coil 2200 may cause the central magnet array to move back and forth along the
shaft. This motion may induce a motion in the housing 2220 of the actuator, which in turn
may induce a motion in the housing of the electronic device.
[0447]      In order to prevent the central magnet array from being attracted to the shaft 2250,
which could increase friction between the two and thereby increase the force necessary to
move the central magnet array and frame 2260, the shaft may be formed from a non-ferritic
material such as tungsten, titanium, stainless steel, or the like, and the mass may slide along
the shaft on bearings.
[0448]      The actuator also may have structures that provide restoring force to the mass.
For example, a spring 2210 may be located at either end of the shaft. As the mass impacts
                                              - 125   -

the spring, the spring compresses and stores kinetic energy. This kinetic energy may be
released to return the mass along the shaft 2250, thereby sending it to or near its initial
starting position. The kinetic energy in the spring(s) may cooperate with the coil to move the
magnet in such a fashion.
[0449]       Although a linear actuator has been described herein, it should be appreciated that
other types of actuators may be used in different embodiments. For example, some
embodiments may employ a rotary actuator, a piezoelectric actuator, or any other suitable
linear or non-linear actuator. Likewise, certain embodiments may employ multiple actuators
working in concert.
[0450]      Embodiments described herein may take the form of, be incorporated in, or
operate with a suitable electronic device. One example of such a device is shown in Figure
23A and takes the form of a wearable mechanism. As shown, the mechanism may be worn
on a user's wrist and secured thereto by a band. The mechanism may have a variety of
functions including, but not limited to: keeping time; monitoring a user's physiological
signals and providing health-related information based on those signals; communicating (in a
wired or wireless fashion) with other electronic devices, which may be different types of
devices having different functionalities; providing alerts to a user, which may include audio,
haptic, visual and/or other sensory output, any or all of which may be synchronized with one
another; visually depicting data on a display; gather data from one or more sensors that may
be used to initiate, control, or modify operations of the device; determine a location of a
touch on a surface of the device and/or an amount of force exerted on the device, and use
either or both as input; accepting voice input to control one or more functions; accepting
tactile input to control one or more functions; and so on.
[0451]      Alternative embodiments of suitable electronic devices include a phone, a tablet
computing device, a portable media player, or other portable multifunction device 100 as
shown in Figure 4A. Still other suitable electronic devices may include laptop/notebook
computers, personal digital assistants, touch screens, input-sensitive pads or surfaces, and so
on.
[0452]      Figure 24 depicts an example schematic diagram of a wearable electronic device.
As shown in Figure 24, the device 100 includes one or more processing units 2405 that are
configured to access a memory 2410 having instructions stored thereon. The instructions or
computer programs may be configured to perform one or more of the operations or functions
                                               - 126 -

described with respect to the device 100. For example, the instructions may be configured to
control or coordinate the operation of the various components of the device. Such
components include, but are not limited to, display 2415, one or more input/output
components 2420, one or more communication channels 2425, one or more sensors 2430,
2435, a speaker 2440, microphone 2445, and/or one or more haptic feedback devices 2450.
In some embodiments the speaker and microphone may be combined into a single unit and/or
may share a common port through a housing of the device. Some embodiments also include
a battery 2455 or wireless power 2460. Each of the components of the device 100 as
depicted in Figure 24 can instead be a component in another figure with a corresponding
name or function.
[0453]      The processing units 2405 of Figure 24 may be implemented as any electronic
device capable of processing, receiving, or transmitting data or instructions. For example,
the processing units 2405 may include one or more of: a microprocessor, a central
processing unit (CPU), an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a digital signal
processor (DSP), or combinations of such devices. As described herein, the term "processor"
is meant to encompass a single processor or processing unit, multiple processors, multiple
processing units, or other suitably configured computing element or elements.
[0454]      In some embodiments the electronic device may accept a variety of bands, straps,
or other retention mechanisms (collectively, "bands"). These bands may be removably
connected to the electronic device by a lug that is accepted in a recess or other aperture
within the device and locks thereto. The lug may be part of the band or may be separable
(and/or separate) from the band. Generally, the lug may lock into the electronic device's
recess and thereby maintain connection between the band and device. The user may release a
locking mechanism to permit the lug to slide or otherwise move out of the recess. In some
embodiments, the recess may be formed in the band and the lug may be affixed or
incorporated into the device.
[0455]      A user may change combinations of bands and electronic devices, thereby
permitting mixing and matching of the two categories. It should be appreciated that devices
having other forms and/or functions may include similar recesses and may releasably mate
with a lug and/or band incorporating a lug. In this fashion, an ecosystem of bands and
devices may be envisioned, each of which is compatible with another. A single band may be
used to connect to devices, as one further example; in such embodiments the band may
                                              - 127 -

   WO 2016/036447                                                          PCT/US2015/041858
include electrical interconnections that permit the two devices to transmit signals to one
another and thereby interact with one another.
[0456]      In many embodiments, the electronic device may keep and display time,
essentially functioning as a wristwatch among other things. Time may be displayed in an
analog or digital format, depending on the device, its settings, and (in some cases) a user's
preferences. Typically, time is displayed on a digital display stack forming part of the
exterior of the device.
[0457]      The display stack may include a cover element, such as a cover glass, overlying a
display. The cover glass need not necessarily be formed from glass, although that is an
option; it may be formed from sapphire, zirconia, alumina, chemically strengthened glass,
hardened plastic and so on. Likewise, the display may be a liquid crystal display, an organic
light-emitting diode display, or any other suitable display technology. Among other
elements, the display stack may include a backlight in some embodiments.
[0458]      The device also may comprise one or more touch sensors to determine a location
of a touch on the cover glass. A touch sensor may be incorporated into or on the display
stack in order to determine a location of a touch. The touch sensor may be self-capacitive in
certain embodiments, mutual-capacitive in others, or a combination thereof.
[0459]      Similarly, the device may include a force sensor to determine an amount of force
applied to the cover glass. The force sensor may be a capacitive sensor in some embodiments
and a strain sensor in some embodiments. In either embodiment, the force sensor is generally
transparent and made form transparent materials, or is located beneath or away from the
display in order not to interfere with the view of the display. The force sensor may, for
example, take the form of two capacitive plates separated by silicone or another deformable
material. As the capacitive plates move closer together under an external force, the change in
capacitance may be measured and a value of the external force correlated from the
capacitance change. Further, by comparing relative capacitance changes from multiple points
on the force sensor, or from multiple force sensors, a location or locations at which force is
exerted may be determined. In one embodiment the force sensor may take the form of a
gasket extending beneath the periphery of the display. The gasket may be segmented or
unitary, depending on the embodiment.
[0460]      The electronic device may also provide alerts to a user. An alert may be

running low); receipt of information by the device (such as receiving a message);
communications between the device and another mechanism/device (such as a second type of
device informing the device that a message is waiting or communication is in progress); an
operational state of an application (such as, as part of a game, or when a calendar
appointment is imminent) or the operating system (such as when the device powers on or
shuts down); and so on. The number and types of triggers for an alert are various and far
ranging.
[0461]      The alert may be auditory, visual, haptic, or a combination thereof. A haptic
actuator may be housed within the device and may move linearly to generate haptic output
(although in alternative embodiments the haptic actuator may be rotary or any other type). A
speaker may provide auditory components of an alert and the aforementioned display may
provide visual alert components. In some embodiments a dedicated light, display, or other
visual output component may be used as part of an alert.
[0462]      The auditory, haptic and/or visual components of the alert may be synchronized to
provide an overall experience to a user. One or more components may be delayed relative to
other components to create a desired synchronization between them. The components may
be synchronized so that they are perceived substantially simultaneously; as one example, a
haptic output may be initiated slightly before an auditory output since the haptic output may
take longer to be perceived than the audio. As another example, a haptic output (or portion
thereof) may be initiated substantially before the auditory output but at a weak or even
subliminal level, thereby priming the wearer to receive the auditory output.
[0463]      The example electronic device may communicate with other electronic devices
either through a wired connection or wirelessly. Data may be passed between devices,
permitting one device to relay information to another; control another; employ another's
sensors, outputs, and/or inputs; and so on. Figure 23B depicts a user 2310 wearing a sample
electronic device 100 with a second electronic device 2320 in his pocket. The second device
optionally has any of the capabilities described herein for devices 100 and 300. Data may be
wirelessly transmitted between the electronic devices 100, 2320, thereby permitting the user
210 to receive, view, and interact with data from the second device 2320 by means of the first
electronic device 100. Thus, the user 2310 may have access to part or all of the second
device's functionality through the first electronic device 100 without actually needing to
interact directly with the second device.

    WO 2016/036447                                                         PCT/US2015/041858
[0464]      Further, the electronic devices 100, 2320 may cooperate not only to share data but
to share functionality as well. For example, one of the two devices may incorporate a sensor,
application, or function that the other lacks. The electronic device lacking such capabilities
may request them from the other device, which may share wirelessly with the requesting
device. Thus, multiple devices may operate together to provide expanded functions,
software, access and the like between the two and ultimately to a user. As one non-limiting
example, the electronic device 100 may be unable to place or receive telephone calls while
the second device 2320 may be able to do so. A user may nonetheless make and/or receive
calls through the first device 100, which may employ the second device 2320 to actually
place or accept a call.
[0465]      As another non-limiting example, an electronic device 100 may wirelessly
communicate with a sales terminal nearby, thus permitting a user to quickly and efficiently
conduct a transaction such as selling, buying, or returning a good. The electronic device may
use near field communications technology to perform these and other functions.
[0466]      As mentioned above, a band may be connected to two electronic devices and may
serve as a wired communication path between the two. As another example, the devices may
communicate wirelessly, thereby permitting one device to relay information from a second to
a user. This latter example may be particularly useful when the second is inaccessible.
[0467]      Certain embodiments may incorporate one or more biometric sensors to measure
certain physiological characteristics of a user. The device may include a photoplesymogram
sensor to determine a user's heart rate or blood oxygenation levels, for example. The device
may also or instead include electrodes to measure the body impedance of a user, which may
permit the device to estimate body fat percentages, the body's electrical activity, body
impedance, and so on. Also include blood pressure, ultraviolet exposure, etc. Depending on
the sensors incorporated into or associated with the electronic device, a variety of user
characteristics may be measured and/or estimated, thereby permitting different health
information to be provided to a user.
[0468]      Certain embodiments may be wirelessly charged. For example, an inductive
charging base may transmit power to an inductive receiver within the device in order to
charge a battery of the device. Further, by varying the inductive field between the device and
base, data may be communicated between the two. As one simple non-limiting example, this
may be used to wake the base from a low-power sleep state to an active charging state when
                                               - 130 -

the device is placed on the base. Other wireless charging systems also may be used (e.g.,
near field magnetic resonance and radio frequency). Alternatively, the device also may
employ wired charging through electrodes.
[0469]      In certain embodiments, the device may include a rotary input, which may take
the form of a crown with a stem. The crown and stem may be rotated to provide the rotary
input. Rotation of the stem and/or crown may be sensed optically, electrically, magnetically,
or mechanically. Further, in some embodiments the crown and stem may also move laterally,
thereby providing a second type of input to the device.
[0470]      The electronic device may likewise include one or more buttons. The button(s)
may be depressed to provide yet another input to the device. In various embodiments, the
button may be a dome switch, rocker switch, electrical contact, magnetic switch, and so on.
In some embodiments the button may be waterproof or otherwise sealed against the
environment.
[0471]      Various embodiments may include or otherwise incorporate one or more motion
sensors. A motion sensor may detect motion of the device and provide, modify, cease, or
otherwise affect a state, output, or input of the device or associated applications based on the
motion. As non-limiting examples, a motion may be used to silence the device or
acknowledge an alert generated by the device. Sample motion sensors include
accelerometers, gyroscopic sensors, magnetometers, GPS sensors, distance sensors, and so
on. Some embodiments may use a GPS sensor to facilitate or enable location and/or
navigation assistance.
[0472]      As shown in Figure 24, the device 100 may also include one or more acoustic
elements, including a speaker 2440 and/or a microphone 2445. The speaker 2440 may
include drive electronics or circuitry and may be configured to produce an audible sound or
acoustic signal in response to a command or input. Similarly, the microphone 2445 may also
include drive electronics or circuitry and is configured to receive an audible sound or
acoustic signal in response to a command or input. The speaker 2440 and the microphone
2445 may be acoustically coupled to port or opening in the case that allows acoustic energy
to pass, but may prevent the ingress of liquid and other debris.
[0473]      Certain embodiments may incorporate an ambient light sensor. The ambient light
sensor may permit the device to sense a brightness of its environment and adjust certain
operational parameters accordingly. For example, the electronic device may modify a
                                                - 131 -

brightness of a display in response to the sensed ambient light. As another example, the
electronic device may turn the display off if little or no light is sensed for a period of time.
[0474]       These and other functions, operations, and abilities of the electronic device will be
apparent upon reading the specification in its entirety.
Alert Class Based Haptic Output
[0475]       Alert conditions can be triggered in many different ways according to some
embodiments. For example, some alerts are triggered by a communication from another
person, such as receiving an email, receiving a voicemail message, and receiving a text
message. Other alerts are triggered by user-set notifications, such as a calendar alert or
reminder. Yet other alerts are triggered by system based notifications, such as application
based or device-based alerts, such as a financial transaction event or a device pairing event.
Some alerts are triggered by third party applications, whereas other alerts are triggered from
applications or other aspects native to the device. What type of triggered resulted in the alert
provides the basis for providing a corresponding haptic output, according to some
embodiments.
[0476]       A corresponding haptic is associated with an alert class according to some
embodiments, allowing the user to, over time, come to understand the haptic feedback as a
language with specific haptic and other output associated with specific alert classes.
Providing haptic output that correlates with various alert classes creates a more efficient
human-machine interface, thereby reducing the amount of time it takes for a user to
understand alerts and perform operations, which consequently reduces energy use and
increases battery life for battery powered devices. Figure 25 is a flow diagram of a method
2500 for providing various haptic and other feedback alerts, each corresponding to a different
alert class according to some embodiments. Note that in some embodiments, different steps
may be performed other than those shown in Figure 25.
[0477]       The method begins by the device 100 detecting 2505 an event. For an application
executing on a computing device 100 with a tactile output generator, the event takes various
forms according to various embodiments. An event is any notification, alert, or other event
directed to a user of the device. In some circumstances, the device 100 has a touch-sensitive
display.
[0478]       Different types of alert events correspond to different event classes according to
some embodiments. In accordance with a determination of the event type falling into a
                                               - 132  -

    WO 2016/036447                                                            PCT/US2015/041858
particular class, an alert is provided corresponding to the event class. For example, in
accordance with a determination that the event is a type of event in the first event class, a first
alert is provided 2515 that includes a first haptic component generated by the tactile output
generator. Similarly, in accordance with a determination that the event is a type of event in a
second event class that includes a plurality of different event types, a second alert is provided
2520 that includes a second haptic component, generated by the tactile output generator, that
is different from the first haptic component. Likewise, in accordance with a determination
that the event is a type of event in a third event class that includes a plurality of different
event types, a third alert is provided 2525 that includes a third haptic component, generated
by the tactile output generator, that is different from the first haptic component and the
second haptic component. Thus, the haptic output depends on the event class that the event
belongs to according to some embodiments.
[0479]       According to some embodiments, the first haptic component is different from the
second haptic component and the third haptic component based on one or more of spacing
between haptic outputs, number of haptic outputs, and change in the amplitude of haptic
outputs over time during the haptic component.
[0480]       In some embodiments, the haptic components are designed to be substantially
different so as to enable a user to easily distinguish between the different classes of alerts
whether or not an audible component of the alert is provided by the device, as discussed in
conjunction with Figure 25 above. For example, the device may have a plurality of unique
alerts that correspond to different events, and the first event class, the second event class, and
the third event class correspond to types of events that typically occur more frequently than
the events that correspond to unique alerts.
[0481]       In some circumstances the event classes corresponds to events generated based on
different factors. For example, according to some embodiments, a first class of events
includes events generated based on communications from other users, a second class of
events includes events generated based on predefined criteria entered by a user of the device,
and a third class of events includes events generated based on the satisfaction of device
monitored criteria.
[0482]       According to some embodiments, the event classes correspond to various events,
as further discussed below in conjunction with Table 9. For example, the first type of event
is in a personal event class, the second type of event is in a user-set event class, and the third
                                                - 133 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                             PCT/US2015/041858
type of event is in a system event class, according to some embodiments. A personal event
class may include events such as incoming messages, incoming email, incoming voicemail,
etc. A user-set event class may include events such as calendar notifications, reminder
notifications, timer/alarm events, etc. A system event class may include events such as a
pairing event, a financial transaction event, or a battery level event, etc. According to some
embodiments, the alerts corresponding to each class are pre-configured for that class, such
that the class shares one or more attribute of the haptic output. According to some
embodiments, the haptic corresponding to a class is configurable by the user of the device
100.
[0483]       According to some embodiments, in response to detecting 2506 the event, and in
accordance with a determination that the event is a type of event in a fourth event class that
includes a plurality of different event types, providing 2530 a fourth alert that includes a
fourth haptic component, generated by the tactile output generator, that is different from the
first haptic component, the second haptic component, and the third haptic component. The
fourth event class corresponds to an event generated by a third party application according to
come embodiments, which may include various second-party or third party events, for
example a social network providing a social networking message or a game application
providing a game notification.
[0484]       According to some embodiments, the fourth haptic component is differentiated
from the first haptic component, the second haptic component, and the third haptic
component by a haptic output element that is not included in the first haptic component, the
second haptic component, or the third haptic component. For example, in the case of the
fourth event class corresponding to an event generated by a third party application, the fourth
haptic component may include a haptic component unique to third party events (e.g., a
particular vibration pattern) and not included in the haptic output provided corresponding to
the other classes, such that a user can easily tell that an alert is from a third party application
rather than from any of the native applications or features that are supplied by the device. In
this example, the first, second, and third event classes correspond to events initiating from the
device directly or from an application native to the device. However, in some embodiments a
haptic component corresponding to a given class may be unique to that class and not included
in the haptic output provided corresponding to the other classes, such that a user can easily
                                                - 134  -

tell from the haptic output that an alert is from a particular event class as distinguished from
other classes.
[0485]      In some embodiments, if the haptic output is accompanied by respective audio
component output, the audio components are reflective of the event class as well. For
example, the audio component for a class may be unique to that class (e.g., a particular type
of sound) and not included in the audio output provided corresponding to the other classes,
such that a user can easily tell from the audio output that an alert is from a particular event
class as distinguished from other classes.
[0486]      Table 9 shows a few exemplary circumstances under which the device 100 has
information used to determine that the detected event is of a known event class. The
examples shown represent four event classes: personal, user-set, system, and third party, but
could be any event class. The event types shown in Table 9 include email messages, text
messages, and voicemail messages (Personal), calendar and reminder notifications, timer and
alarm alerts (User-Set), device pairing, financial translations, and battery level indications
(System), and third party messages and notifications (Third Party), but could be any other
events providing similar information to the device 100 for making this determination.

[0487]       For the examples shown, the event class column shows which of four classes the
event falls into: Personal, User-Set, System, or Third Party. Within each class, various event
types are listed per the event type column. A few examples are listed for each event class,
but the list is not meant to be exclusive of other event types. In some embodiments, Personal
events are those sent to the device user personally, typically by another user, such as an
email, text, or voicemail. User-Set events are events that, as the name implies, are set by the
user of the device, e.g., calendar notifications, reminders, timer expiration, alarms going off,
etc., according to some embodiments.       In some embodiments, System events are events
generated by the device or system itself, such as a device pairing or batter level indication.
Third Party events can vary greatly, but generally correspond to an event triggered by a third
party application running on the device, according to some embodiments. Examples of third
party events include messages or notifications corresponding to a social networking
application, notifications or reminders corresponding to a gaming application, activity alerts
corresponding to a fitness application, or the like.
[0488]       Note that in the examples shown, regardless of the event type, every event
corresponding to a given event class has the same haptic and audio output. According to
some embodiments, all Personal event class events result in output of a haptic component that
includes a fast double tap first, followed by a ding audio component with a long fade. In this
example, the output is perceived by the user as tap-tap-ding (fade). According to some
embodiments, all User-Set event class events result in output of a haptic component that
includes a slow double tap first, followed by a chime audio component. In this example, the
output is perceived by the user as tap---tap-chime.

[0489]      According to some embodiments, all System event class events result in output of
a haptic rumble that overlaps at the end of the rumble with a quieter "dit" audio component,
followed by a ding audio component with a short fade that begins after completion of the
rumble. In this example, the output is perceived by the user as rumble..(dit).. -ding (fade).
According to some embodiments, all Third Party event class events result in output of a
consistent haptic component corresponding to the third party applications including a fast
double tap and a buzz fade, with the buzz fade over lapping in part with an audio component,
which may vary by the event type or condition associated with the third party application. In
this example, the output is perceived by the user as tap-tap-ding (up or down).. .(buzz
(fade))...
[0490]      Note that in these examples, both the haptic and audio components uniquely
correspond to a given class, such that a user can easily tell from the output that an alert is
from a particular event class as distinguished from other classes. In the example of the third
party application class, the haptic is identical and the audio is characteristic of the class but
varies depending on the event type or condition. In addition, the haptic output portion alone
also uniquely corresponds to a given class in these examples, such that a user can tell from
the haptic output alone that an alert is from a particular event class, even if the user has the
sound turned off on his or her device. In order to provide users with a consistent and easily
understandable alert language, the different classes of alerts each correspond to multiple
different events, and in embodiments where the alerts are user selectable (or user modifiable),
users are optionally provided with options for changing a sound or haptic output associated
with an event class, but changing that sound or haptic output will cause the sound or haptic
output to change for all events that are associated with that class of alerts. Additionally, in
some embodiments, users are provided with the option to assign events to different event
classes. This customizability enables users to customize the alerts provided by their device
while still maintaining a consistent alert language that enhances the efficiency and
effectiveness of the alerts.
[0491]      It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in Figure

order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of ordinary skill in

Selective Alert Salience for Haptic Output
[0492]       Alert conditions are selectively subject to an increase in the salience of the haptic
output according to some embodiments. In some embodiments, the device 100 can modify
the salience of the haptic output to "prime" the user, which helps draw greater attention to the
alert. For example, the device 100 can provide a priming haptic output as a precursor to
another haptic output, the priming haptic output designed to increase the attentiveness of a
user operating the device 100 to the other haptic output. In some circumstances, the salience
is increased for some haptics and not others. This is particularly important for users with
sensory impairments (e.g,. users who cannot hear audible alerts or have reduced sensitivity to
vibrating alerts).
[0493]       Figure 26 is a flow diagram of a method 2600 for providing selective salience
increase for various haptics, according to some embodiments. Note that in some
embodiments, different steps may be performed other than those shown in Figure 26.
[0494]       The method 2600 begins by detecting 2605 the occurrence of a first event at a
computing device with a tactile output generator. The event can be of any type, including the
event types discussed in conjunction with Figure 25 above. In response to detecting the
occurrence of the first event, events of different types may produce different alerts with
different salience. For example, in accordance with a determination that the first event is a
first type of event, a first alert is provided 2610 with the tactile output generator that includes
a first haptic component, and the haptic component is selected based at least in part on an
alert-salience setting of the device. In accordance with a determination that the first event is
a second type of event, a second alert is provided 2630, with the tactile output generator that
includes a second haptic component selected without regard to the alert-salience setting of
the device.

    WO 2016/036447                                                           PCT/US2015/041858
[0495]      According to some embodiments, the alert-salience setting of the device has two
values, with one value corresponding to increasing salience of the alert and the second value
corresponding to not increasing the salience of the alert. Figure 27 illustrates an exemplary
user interface for an alert-salience setting on a device 100 in accordance with some
embodiments. As shown, an increased salience alert selector 2710 allows the user to turn use
of increased salience on or off, such that "on" indicates that certain alerts will have increased
salience, and "off' indicates that no alerts will have increased salience. As discussed herein,
some alerts will have increased salience when this setting is on, and some will not take into
account the setting. For example, using the exemplary classes discussed in conjunction with
Figure 25, when the alert-salience setting is on, events in the Personal and User-Set event
classes will result in haptic output with increased salience, and events in the System and
Third Party event classes will be unchanged despite the alert-salience setting being on,
according to some embodiments.
[0496]      When an event type is part of a binary set of related events, one of the two events
can be designated as receiving an increased salience haptic according to some embodiments.
For example, buddy pairing, when attempted has only two results: successful buddy pairing
or failed buddy pairing. For successful budding pairing, increased salience may not be
necessary as it is the expected outcome. However, a failure to pair may be unexpected, and
thus can be called to the user's attention via an increased saliency haptic to more easily gain
the user's attention. Thus, for the buddy pairing event failure result of the binary options, an
increased saliency haptic would result, whereas for a buddy pairing success a standard haptic
output would be provided, according to some embodiments.
[0497]      In some embodiments, whether or not an alert has increased salience when the
increased-salience setting is on is based on an importance of the event that triggered the alert.
For example, in some embodiments events can include information (e.g., in the form of
metadata) corresponding to the importance or urgency of the event, such as an urgent or
important flag on an email, a message received from a VIP contact, or other similar
information indicating that the event is in some way more important than other events. In
some embodiments, the content of the event may be examined for keywords indicating
importance such as "urgent," "high importance," etc. In some embodiments, an even higher
degree of salience can be added for events with more than one increased salience indicator.
For example, when a message is received and the increased salience is off, the message
                                               - 139 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                          PCT/US2015/041858
triggers a standard haptic for the Personal event class. However, when the same message is
received from a VIP contact and the salience setting is off, some increase in salience still may
be applied to distinguish the VIP contact over other messaging contacts. And when the
increased salience is on, messages received increased salience. Thus, according to some
embodiments, an increase from one trigger (e.g., increased salience setting for Personal) can
be combined with an increase from another trigger (e.g., message is from a VIP contact) to
produce an "extra salience" output. For example, the extra salience output could be three
separate priming haptic components preceding the standard haptic for the event class.
[0498]       Some event types are deemed more important by way of the nature of the event,
according to some embodiments. For example, events triggered financial transactions in
some instances are considered more important than other events, regardless of the event class
that the financial transactions fall within. Thus, specific categories of events considered
more sensitive - in the example of financial transactions, these could include any activity
associated with banking or stock trading applications, or other events related to money and/or
more subject to fraud activities. Another example is events within an event class subject to
increased salience (e.g., Personal) that also are message event types likely to have been
received directly from a human user other than the user operating the device. For example, an
incoming message or call from a known email address or phone number on the user's contact
list. For further discussion of event types likely to have been received from a human user
other than the user operating the device, see Table 2. In this example, all message event
types likely to have been received from a human user have an increased salience haptic (e.g.,
mail, messages, and voicemail), but other event types in the class do not (e.g., photostream
activity).
[0499]       According to some embodiments, certain event types may be excluded from
increased haptic output salience, even when other event types in the event class provide the
increased salience output corresponding to an increased salience setting. For example, within
an event class (e.g., Personal) with increased saliency on, events triggered by responses to UI
interactions (e.g., scrolling, navigating through items, pressing UI buttons, or other user
input) do not have increased salience alerts even with the setting on. In some instances, the
user input is characteristic of a high level of user engagement with the application or device,
and thus is an event that doesn't require increased salience. Thus, the user is not bombarded
                                                - 140 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                           PCT/US2015/041858
with an unduly strong feedback signal when the user has a high degree of engagement or
interaction with the application/device.
[0500]       Another condition under which certain event types may be excluded from
increased haptic output salience, even when other event types in the event class provide the
increased salience output corresponding to an increased salience setting, is when the
application providing the alert is in an active state (e.g., being used by the device user). For
example, a received message event type is in the Personal event class, and thus typically
would be subject to increased salience alerts when the setting is on. However, in the event
that the user of the device is using the messaging application at the time the message is
received, an increased salience haptic would not be provided. On the other hand, the same
received message event would trigger increased salience if the user was not using the
messaging application when the message was received.
[0501]       In the example above in which a first event type results in an alert that includes a
haptic component selected based at least on the alert-salience setting and a second event type
selects a haptic component without regard to the alert-salience setting, when the setting value
corresponds to increasing salience of the alert, the first alert would have increased salience
and the second alert would not. Thus, despite the alert-salience setting having a value
corresponding to increasing salience of the alert, not all alerts would have increased salience.
Continuing the example from above, if the first type of event is an incoming message event,
corresponding to a Personal event class type of event, and the second type of event is a
payment event, corresponding to a System event class type of event, and the setting value
corresponds to increasing salience of the alert, the message (Personal class) event would have
increased salience but the payment (System class) event would not, since the second type
does not take the setting into consideration. According to some embodiments, Personal and
User-Set event classes would have increased salience haptics for alerts when the alert
salience setting is on, whereas System and Third Party event classes would have the standard
haptic alert regardless of the alert-salience setting value.
[0502]       According to some embodiments, the first alert is different from the second alert.
For example, the first alert could include a different haptic component than the second alert,
or the first alert could include a different audio component than the second alert, or the first
alert could include both a different haptic component and a different audio component.

[0503]        However, in some embodiments the device forgoes the additional haptic
component and just provides 2625 the standard haptic component for alerts triggered in
response to events in the first plurality of event classes when the alert-salience setting has the
second value. Continuing with the above examples related to classes, a standard haptic
component would result from alerts triggered in response to Personal or User-Set event class
events, when the alert-salience setting has the second value (off). Likewise, in some
embodiments the device forgoes providing the additional haptic component and just provides
2625 the standard haptic component for alerts triggered in response to events in a second
plurality of event classes, without regard to the alert-salience setting has the first value or the
second value. Continuing with the above examples related to classes, a standard haptic
component would also result from alerts triggered in response to System or Third Party event
class events, regardless of the alert-salience setting value.    In some cases the second
plurality of event classes is distinct from the first plurality of event classes. Thus, in some
examples the additional haptic component is provided only if an incoming event is both of an
event class for which the device increases alert-salience and the alert-salience value is set to
increasing the salience of the alert. For example, an event in the Person or User-Set event
classes, when the alert-salience setting is "on."
[0504]        According to some embodiments, the method for providing selective salience
increase for various haptics includes first determining 2615 a value of the alert-salience
setting. In accordance with a determination that the alert-salience setting has a first value, the
first alert includes 2620 a first haptic component and a second haptic component, while in
accordance with a determination that the alert-salience setting has a second value different
from the first value, the first alert includes 2625 the first haptic component but does not
include the second haptic component. As an example, the first value could be an "increase
alert salience" value and the second value could be a "do not increase alert salience" value.
Continuing with the above examples, for an event in the Personal or User-Set event classes,
and an alert-salience setting of "increase alert salience" (on), according to some embodiments
alerts would include both the first haptic component - the standard haptic component for the
corresponding event class - and a second haptic component to increase the saliency of the
haptic output associated with the alert. For an event in the System or Third Party event
classes, even with an alert-salience setting of "increase alert salience" (on), according to
some embodiments alerts would include only the first, standard haptic component for the
                                                 - 142 -

    WO 2016/036447                                                             PCT/US2015/041858
event corresponding class. According to some embodiments, the method further includes in
accordance with a determination that the first event is a third type of event, providing a third
alert that includes a haptic component selected based at least in part on the alert-salience
setting of the device. In this example, providing the third alert that includes the haptic
component selected based at least in part on the alert-salience setting of the device includes
determining a value of the alert-salience setting (e.g., similar to step 2615 above). Referring
again to the event class examples, if the Personal event class was the first type, the User-Set
event class is the third type of this example, according to some embodiments.
[0505]       According to some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the
alert-salience setting has the first value, the third alert includes a third haptic component and
a fourth haptic component, and in accordance with a determination that the alert-salience
setting has the second value different from the first value, the third alert includes the third
haptic component but does not include the fourth haptic component. As with the prior
example, the first value is an increase alert salience value and the second value is a do not
increase salience value, according to some embodiments. For example, the third haptic
component - the standard haptic component for the corresponding event class - would be
paired with the fourth haptic component, to increase the saliency of the haptic output
associated with the alert. In addition, in some embodiments, the fourth haptic component is
the same as the second haptic component. For example, both the first haptic component and
the second haptic component are increased-salience haptic, or priming, components that are
used to notify the user that an alert is imminent. In some embodiments, the device provides
the second haptic output following and within a specified time interval of providing the
priming haptic output. Continuing with the event class examples, the fourth haptic,
corresponding to increased salience of event alerts for events in the User-Set event class, is
the same as the second haptic, corresponding to increased salience of event alerts for events
in the Person event class, both of which haptic components are a priming haptic that precedes
the standard haptic for each class.
[0506]       According to some embodiments, the method further includes, when the first alert
is detected while the alert-salience setting of the device has the first value, that the first alert
provided in response to the first event includes the first haptic component and the second
haptic component and the second alert provided in response to the first event includes a
second-alert haptic component. The method goes on, in some embodiments, to receive a
                                                 - 143 -

request to change the alert-salience setting of the device to the second value while the alert
salience setting of the device has the first value, and in response to receiving the request to
change the alert-salience setting, changing the alert-salience setting to the second value. For
example, if for Personal event class events the first and second haptic components have been
provided due to the alert-salience setting being on, the request is a request to turn the alert
salience setting off. Similarly, the method includes in some embodiments, while the alert
salience setting of the device has the second value, detecting occurrence of a second event,
and in response providing a third alert in accordance with a determination that the second
event is the first type of event, the third alert including the first haptic component and not
including the second haptic component. For example, the third haptic component only has
been provided for User-Set event class events, because the alert-salience setting is turned off.
Likewise, in accordance with a determination that the second event is the second type of
event, the method proceeds with providing the second alert that includes the second-alert
haptic component. In some embodiments, the second alert does not include the second haptic
component (e.g., the second alert is not affected by the alert-salience setting and does not
include a the second "extra salience" haptic component whether the alert-salience setting is
set to "increase alert salience" "do not increase alert salience"). For example, the second
type of event is a System event class event, and the second haptic component is not included
in the output regardless of the alert-salience setting.
[0507]       According to some embodiments, the first haptic component is different from the
second haptic component and the third haptic component based on one or more of spacing
between haptic outputs, number of haptic outputs, and change in the amplitude of haptic
outputs over time during the haptic component.
[0508]       In some embodiments, the haptic components are designed to be substantially
different so as to enable a user to easily distinguish between the different classes of alerts
whether or not an audible component of the alert is provided by the device, as discussed in
conjunction with Figure 25 above. For example, the device may have a plurality of unique
alerts that correspond to different events, and the first event class, the second event class, and
the third event class correspond to types of events that typically occur more frequently than
the events that correspond to unique alerts. As it relates to classes, a haptic component of an
alert for an event in the first event class is distinguishable by the user from a haptic
component of an alert for an event in the second event class, both of which are
                                                 - 144 -

distinguishable by the user from a haptic component of an alert for an event in the third event
class. In some cases, events that typically occur more frequently are events that, statistically
speaking, occur more frequently than other events. As discussed above in conjunction with
Table 9, in some embodiments, events that occur more frequently are grouped together into
event classes and provided with a consistent alert so that a user can learn to differentiate
between the different types of events that occur frequently.
[0509]      In some embodiments, the event class associated with the event impacts whether
an additional haptic component is provided in conjunction with a triggered alert. According
to some embodiments, an additional haptic component is provided 2620 for alerts triggered in
response to events in a first plurality of event classes (e.g., Personal) when the alert-salience
setting has a first value. For example, in addition to a haptic associated with the first event
class, an additional haptic is provided as well. The additional haptic is a priming haptic in
some embodiments. For example, in some circumstances the second haptic component
precedes the first haptic component.
[0510]      In some circumstances the event classes corresponds to events generated based on
different factors. For example, according to some embodiments, a first class of events
includes events generated based on communications from other users, a second class of
events includes events generated based on predefined criteria entered by a user of the device,
and a third class of events includes events generated based on the satisfaction of device
monitored criteria. According to some embodiments, the event classes are characterized as
belonging to a class by the event information, similar to the event classes discussed in
conjunction with Figure 25: Personal, User-Set, System, and Third Party.
[0511]      In some embodiments, the event classes are configurable such that the device
enables a user to select which types of events fall into an event class. However, in some
embodiments, the types of events that fall into an event class are predefined, and the device
does not enable a user of the device to select which event types fall into a particular event
class.
[0512]      Similarly, according to some embodiments, the alert-salience setting is user
configurable, such that the user can select specific event classes or even individual event
types for which the user would like increased saliency in the haptic output. Allowing the
user to customize haptic output that correlates with events the user deems more important
creates a more efficient human-machine interface, thereby reducing the amount of time it

[0514]       For the examples shown, the event class column shows which of four classes the
event falls into: Personal, User-Set, System, or Third Party. Within each class, various event
types are listed per the event type column. A few examples are listed for each event class,
but the list is not meant to be exclusive of other event types. As with the previous chart,
regardless of the event type, every event corresponding to a given event class has the same
standard haptic and an audio output characteristic of the class, and each class shares the same
increased salience output as well for any events corresponding to the event class. In the
example of the third party application class, the haptic is identical and the accompanying
audio component is characteristic of third party applications even though the audio varies by
event type or condition.
[0515]       Table 10 includes an extra column corresponding to the alert-salience setting.
Note that when the alert-salience setting is off, indicating that increased saliency should not
be used, the standard haptic and audio output is shown, which corresponds to the examples in
Table 9. This maintains the goal of both the haptic and audio components uniquely
corresponding to a given class, such that a user can easily tell from the output that an alert is
from a particular event class as distinguished from other classes.
[0516]       For two of the event classes, Personal and User-Set, when the alert-salience is
turned on, indicating that increased saliency should be used, a salient buzz haptic is added to
the standard output for the class. According to some embodiments, the additional haptic is
added to the beginning of the alert such that it precedes the standard output. In this example,
a salient buzz haptic component is added, which is a series of taps of a longer duration and of
high frequency, such that the user feels a constant vibration or "buzz." According to some
embodiments, the salient buzz has a duration of 0.5 seconds or more, and ramps up in
                                                -  147 -

intensity from the beginning of the buzz to the end, which assists in getting the user's
attention prior to the standard output. Also note that even when the alert-salience setting is
on, two of the event classes, System and Third Party, show no increase in saliency of the
output, i.e., the standard output is used regardless of the setting.

correspond to different events are shown. The events are divided into Notifications,
Feedback, and Alerts. Audio outputs with the same name correspond to the same (or
substantially the same) audio output (audio waveforms). Audio outputs with different names
correspond to different (or materially/perceptibly different) audio outputs (audio waveforms).
Haptic outputs with the same name correspond to the same (or substantially the same) haptic
output (haptic waveforms). Haptic outputs with different names correspond to different (or
materially/perceptibly different) haptic outputs (haptic waveforms). Haptic/Audio output
names that are enclosed in brackets () are, optionally omitted and replaced with the absence
of an audio output or haptic output.
[0518]      In some embodiments, haptic/audio outputs are grouped into a plurality of types
and or classes in addition to the notification classes described above. Notifications generally
correspond to haptic/audio outputs that are designed to get the user's attention when the user
is not paying attention to the device (e.g., when a new message is received or it is time for a
calendar event to occur). Alerts generally correspond to haptic/audio outputs that are
designed to alert the user to operations being performed at the device (or conditions of the
device) while the user is paying attention to the device (e.g., navigation instructions while the
user is walking or driving, device unlock failure/success, etc.). Feedback generally
corresponds to haptic/audio outputs that are designed to give the user feedback that inputs
from the user have been detected by the device (e.g., scrolling inputs, button selection inputs,
sent messages, etc.), or to indicate that the input has caused the device to reach some
threshold (e.g., a scrolling limit, a zoom limit, a force/pressure threshold at which an
alternative menu is displayed). In some embodiments, when the increased salience setting is
"on," increased salience haptic/audio output is provided for notifications, which are designed
to get the user's attention when the user is not paying attention, but not for feedback (e.g.,
because the user is already paying attention to and actively interacting with the device). In
some embodiments, increased salience haptic/audio output is provided for some notifications
associated with an application (e.g., message notifications) when the application is closed but

not for feedback associated with the application when the application is open (e.g., sent and
received message alerts when a messaging application is open). For example in Table 11, a
Messages Notification uses different haptic outputs based on the increased salience setting
(e.g., haptic output HOO when the increased salience setting is off and haptic output H066
when the increased salience setting is on) but Messages Feedback when a message is sent
uses the same haptic output without regard to the increased salience setting (e.g., haptic
output H023 is used if the increased salience setting is on or off).
[0519]       In some embodiments the alert salience setting changes a salience of haptic output
without changing a salience of corresponding audio output. For example, as shown above in
Table 11, the Messages notification uses the same audio output (AGO 1) whether or not the
increased salience setting is on, but uses a different haptic output depending on the increased
salience setting (e.g., haptic output HOO is used when the increased salience setting is off
and haptic output H066 is used when the increased salience setting is on).

26 have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate that the described
order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of ordinary skill in

[0522]       As shown in Figure 28, the device 100 includes a display unit 2801 configured to
display an application, a touch-sensitive surface unit 2803 configured to receive user
contacts, and a processing unit 2805 coupled to the display unit 2801 and the touch-sensitive
surface unit 2803. In some embodiments, the processing unit 2805 includes a detecting unit
2810 and an alert providing unit 2815.
[0523]       The following paragraphs [0524]-[0527] describe different embodiments that may
be implemented, individually or in any combination, by the device 100 illustrated in Figure
28:
[0524]       The processing unit 2805 is configured to detect an event at a device with a tactile
output generator (e.g., with the detecting unit 2810), and responsive to detecting the event, in
accordance with a determination that the event is a type of event in a first event class that
includes a plurality of different event types, provide a first alert that includes a first haptic
component generated by the tactile output generator (e.g., with the alert providing unit 2815).
[0525]       In accordance with a determination that the event is a type of event in a second
event class that includes a plurality of different event types, processing unit 2805 is
configured to provide a second alert that includes a second haptic component, generated by
the tactile output generator, that is different from the first haptic component (e.g., with the
alert providing unit 2815). In accordance with a determination that the event is a type of
event in a third event class that includes a plurality of different event types, processing unit
2805 is configured to provide a third alert that includes a third haptic component, generated
by the tactile output generator, that is different from the first haptic component and the
second haptic component (e.g., with the alert providing unit 2815).
[0526]       According to some embodiments, the first class of events includes events
generated based on communications from other users, the second class of events includes
events generated based on predefined criteria entered by a user of the device, and the third
class of events includes events generated based on the satisfaction of device-monitored
criteria. According to some embodiments, the first haptic component is different from the
second haptic component and the third haptic component based on at least one of: spacing
between haptic outputs, number of haptic outputs, and change in the amplitude of haptic
                                                 - 154 -

outputs over time during the haptic component (e.g., outputs provide by the alert providing
unit 2815).
[0527]      According to some embodiments, the device has a plurality of unique alerts that
correspond to different events (e.g., provided by the alert providing unit 2815), and the first
event class, the second event class, and the third event class correspond to types of events
that typically occur more frequently than the events that correspond to unique alerts.
[0528]      In response to detecting the event, in accordance with a determination that the
event is a type of event in a fourth event class that includes a plurality of different event
types, processing unit 2805 is configured to provide a fourth alert that includes a fourth
haptic component, generated by the tactile output generator, that is different from the first
haptic component, the second haptic component, and the third haptic component (e.g., with
the alert providing unit 2815). According to some embodiments, the fourth event class
corresponds to an event generated by a third party application. According to some
embodiments, the fourth haptic component is differentiated from the first haptic component,
the second haptic component, and the third haptic component by a haptic output element that
is not included in the first haptic component, the second haptic component, or the third haptic
component.
[0529]      As described above, the operations described with reference to Figures 25-27 are
optionally implemented by components depicted in Figures 28-29. Figure 29 shows an
example functional block diagram of device 100 configured in accordance with the principles
of the various described embodiments. It is understood by persons of skill in the art that the
functional blocks described in Figure 29 are, optionally, combined or separated into sub

[0531]        The following paragraphs [0532]-[0540] describe different embodiments that may
be implemented, individually or in any combination, by the device 100 illustrated in Figure
29:
[0532]        The processing unit 2905 is configured to detect occurrence of a first event at a
computing device with a tactile output generator (e.g., with the detecting unit 2910), and in
accordance with a determination that the first event is a first type of event, provide a first
alert with the tactile output generator that includes a first haptic component selected based at
least in part on an alert-salience setting of the device (e.g., with the alert providing unit
2915). In accordance with a determination that the first event is a second type of event,
processing unit 2905 is configured to provide a second alert with the tactile output generator
that includes a second haptic component selected without regard to the alert-salience setting
of the device (e.g., with the alert providing unit 2915). According to some embodiments, the
first alert is different from the second alert.
[0533]        According to some embodiments, providing the first alert that includes the haptic
component selected based at least in part on the alert-salience setting of the device includes
determining a value of the alert-salience setting (e.g., with the alert-salience determination
unit 2920). According to some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the
alert-salience setting has a first value, the first alert (e.g., provided by the alert providing unit
2915) includes a first haptic component and a second haptic component. According to some
embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the alert-salience setting has a second
value different from the first value, the first alert (e.g., provided by the alert providing unit
2915) includes the first haptic component but does not include the second haptic component.
According to some embodiments, the first value of the alert-salience setting is on and the
second value of the alert-salience setting is off. According to some embodiments, the second
haptic component precedes the first haptic component.
[0534]        In accordance with a determination that the first event is a third type of event,
processing unit 2905 is configured to provide a third alert that includes a haptic component
selected based at least in part on the alert-salience setting of the device (e.g., provided by the
alert providing unit 2915). According to some embodiments, the processing unit 2905
providing the third alert that includes the haptic component selected based at least in part on
the alert-salience setting of the device includes the processing unit 2905 being configured to

determine a value of the alert-salience setting (e.g., with the alert-salience determination unit
2920).
[0535]       According to some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the
alert-salience setting has the first value, the third alert includes a third haptic component and
a fourth haptic component. According to some embodiments, in accordance with a
determination that the alert-salience setting has the second value different from the first
value, the third alert includes the third haptic component but does not include the fourth
haptic component. According to some embodiments, the fourth haptic component is the same
as the second haptic component.
[0536]       According to some embodiments, when the first alert is detected while the alert
salience setting of the device has the first value, the first alert provided in response to the first
event includes the first haptic component and the second haptic component and the second
alert provided in response to the first event includes a second-alert haptic component (e.g.,
the alerts are provided by the alert providing unit 2915). According to some embodiments,
while the alert-salience setting of the device has the first value, processing unit 2905 is
configured to receive a request to change the alert-salience setting of the device to the second
value (e.g., with the setting change unit 2925). Also according to some embodiments, in
response to receiving the request to change the alert-salience setting to the second value,
processing unit 2905 is configured to change the alert-salience setting to the second value
(e.g., with the setting change unit 2925).
[0537]       According to some embodiments, while the alert-salience setting of the device has
the second value, processing unit 2905 is configured to detect the occurrence of a second
event (e.g., with the detecting unit 2910) and in response to detecting the occurrence of the
second event, in accordance with a determination that the second event is the first type of
event, processing unit 2905 is configured to provide a third alert that includes the first haptic
component and does not include the second haptic component (e.g., with the alert providing
unit 2915). According to some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the
second event is the second type of event, processing unit 2905 is configured to provide the
second alert that includes the second-alert haptic component (e.g., with the alert providing
unit 2915).
[0538]       According to some embodiments, the processing unit 2905 is configured to
provide an additional haptic component for alerts triggered in response to events in a first

plurality of event classes when the alert-salience setting has a first value (e.g., with the alert
providing unit 2915). According to some embodiments, the processing unit 2905 is
configured to forgo providing the additional haptic component for alerts triggered in response
to events in the first plurality of event classes when the alert-salience setting has the second
value (e.g., with the alert providing unit 2915). According to some embodiments, the
processing unit 2905 is configured to forgo providing the additional haptic component for
alerts triggered in response to events in a second plurality of event classes, distinct from the
first plurality of event classes, without regard to the alert-salience setting has the first value
or the second value (e.g., with the alert providing unit 2915).
[0539]        According to some embodiments, the first class of events includes events
generated based on communications from other users, the second class of events includes
events generated based on predefined criteria entered by a user of the device, and the third
class of events includes events generated based on the satisfaction of device-monitored
criteria. According to some embodiments, the first haptic component is different from the
second haptic component and the third haptic component based on at least one of: spacing
between haptic outputs, number of haptic outputs, and change in the amplitude of haptic
outputs over time during the haptic component (e.g., outputs provide by the alert providing
unit 2915).
[0540]        According to some embodiments, the device has a plurality of unique alerts that
correspond to different events (e.g., provided by the alert providing unit 2915), and the first
event class, the second event class, and the third event class correspond to types of events
that typically occur more frequently than the events that correspond to unique alerts.
Application-Specific Haptic/Audio Output
[0541]        Alert conditions can be triggered within a variety of different application classes
(e.g., first party applications, third party applications), triggered by various applications (e.g.,
email, calendar, text message, payment application, timer application, etc.), and triggered in
many different contexts (e.g., action success, action failure, etc.). Which application class,
which application, and/or in what context a detected condition is detected provides the basis
for generating a corresponding output, according to some embodiments. Providing haptic
and/or audio output that correlates with the application class, application, and/or context
allows for consistency in haptic and audio branding for the output, and thus creates a more
efficient human-machine interface, thereby reducing the amount of time it takes for a user to

[0543]       The first two rows of Table 12 show a first application class, first party
applications, and a second application class, third party applications. For applications within
each class, the alert is a haptic output component corresponding to the class of applications
combined with audio output component including waveform variants specific to that
application class, e.g., first party application alerts include a first haptic component and a
variation of a first class waveform, whereas third party application alerts include a second

haptic component and a variation of a second class waveform. This maintains a consistent
haptic associated with each application class. However, first party applications each
typically have their own haptic, while all third party applications typically share a single
haptic. More specific examples are discussed below in conjunction with Table 13.
[0544]       The third and fourth rows of Table 12 show two different applications within a
single class (first party applications), based on any triggering condition. Both applications
result in the same (first) haptic output, which corresponds to the first party application class,
but each has a different audio output corresponding to a waveform variant for a waveform
associated with the particular application. For example, the first application pairs the first
haptic output with a waveform variant associated with the first application, with different
variants for different conditions within the first application. Similarly, the second application
pairs the first haptic output with a waveform variant associated with the second application,
with different variants for different conditions within the second application. This maintains
a consistent haptic associated with each application. More specific examples are discussed
below in conjunction with Table 14.
[0545]       The last four rows of Table 12 show two different conditions (success, failure),
with haptic output consistent across the condition and audio output variable based on the
specific context. For example, a success condition provides a consistent first haptic
associated with success, whereas context 1 provides a first set of waveforms associated with
context 1 and context 2 provides a second set of waveforms associated with context 2.
Likewise, a failure condition provides a consistent first haptic associated with failure,
whereas context 1 provides a first set of waveforms associated with context 1 and context 2
provides a second set of waveforms associated with context 2. This maintains a consistent
haptic associated with each condition (success, failure). More specific examples are
discussed below in conjunction with Table 15.
[0546]       Which application class an alert condition is triggered within provides the basis
for generating a corresponding output, according to some embodiments. Figure 30 is a flow
diagram of a method 3000 for detecting a first condition and a second condition and
generating corresponding alerts including haptic and audio outputs according to some
embodiments. Note that in some embodiments, different steps may be performed other than
those shown in Figure 30.

[0547]       The method begins by, at an electronic device with one or more haptic output
devices and one or more audio output devices, detecting 3005 occurrence of a first condition
at the device. The first condition can be any of the various alert conditions described
elsewhere herein, and the application can be any application executing on the device 100,
according to some embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, the occurrence of the
condition includes one or more of the receipt of a communication (e.g., a message from an
external source), the detection of an input from a user (e.g., a touch, voice, or mechanical
input that is associated with feedback), or the detection of the satisfaction of triggering
criteria (e.g., the expiration of an alarm, as the completion of a workout, or the like), to name
a few. According to some embodiments, the computing device 100 comprises a touch
sensitive display for receiving the user input.
[0548]       Responsive to detecting the occurrence of the first condition, the device 100
generates 3010 a first alert that corresponds to a respective application in a first class of
applications. The first alert includes, in this example, a first haptic component 3012 that is
output via the one or more haptic output devices and a first audio component 3014, output via
the one or more audio output devices. In this instance, the audio component is composed
from an audio waveform that is designated for use by the respective application in the first
class of applications. In some embodiments, the first class of applications includes first party
applications and the audio component is a unique audio sample that is used to distinguish
alerts for the respective application from alerts for other applications. According to some
embodiments, the first haptic output is provided via the touch-sensitive display on the
computing device 100.
[0549]       The device 100 also detects 3015 occurrence of a second condition at the device
100, optionally at a later time. Responsive to detecting the occurrence of the second
condition, the device generates 3020 a second alert that corresponds to a respective
application in a second class of applications that is different from the first class of
applications, the second alert including a second haptic component 3022 that is output via the
one or more haptic output devices and a second audio component 3024, output via the one or
more audio output devices. In this instance, the audio component is composed from an audio
waveform that is designated for use by applications in the second class of applications. In
some embodiments, the second class of applications includes third party applications and the
audio component is an audio sample that is used to distinguish alerts for third party

applications from alerts for first party applications. According to some embodiments, the
first haptic output is provided via the touch-sensitive display on the computing device 100.
[0550]        Table 13 shows exemplary haptic and audio outputs corresponding to alerts for
various application classes. The first three rows of the table show alerts corresponding to a
first application class, e.g., first party applications. For each of the first party email, calendar,
and text message applications, the output includes a first haptic that corresponds to the first
application class (first party applications) and an audio output that includes a waveform
instance corresponding to the first application class (first party applications). Waveform
variants are discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with Figure 31. By providing
haptic and audio output that correlates with the application class, the user is provided
consistency in branding for output associated with the application class. Tables 9 and 10
above also provide examples of both first party and third party alerts.
[0551]        Similarly, the last three rows of the table show alerts corresponding to a second
application class, e.g., third party applications. For each of the third party message,
notification, and alert, the output includes a second haptic that corresponds to the second
application class (third party applications), which is different from the first haptic
corresponding to the first party application according to some embodiments, and an audio
output that includes a waveform instance corresponding to the second application class (third
party applications). By providing haptic and audio output that correlates with the application
class, the user is provided consistency in branding for output associated with the application
class.

[0552]       In addition, although the third party applications have a unique set of haptic alerts,
they also can share some of the same haptic feedback. For example, an alert that simulates
physical feedback, such as haptic/audio click or a haptic that provides simulated bouncing
(rubber band-like) effect that is provided in conjunction with a user interface element such as
a scrollable list view bouncing when it reaches the end of the display might be available
regardless of the class of application in use. If the application includes a scrollable list, then
the output is available for use within the application upon that action, regardless of the
application class.
[05531
[0554]       According to some embodiments, the generating 3010 of the first alert of the
method is in accordance with a determination that the alert corresponds to a respective
application in a first class of applications, and the generating 3020 of the second alert is in
accordance with a determination that the alert corresponds to a respective application in a
second class of applications that is different from the first class of applications.
[0555]       According to some embodiments, the first haptic component and the second
haptic component are composed from one or more haptic waveforms that are available to
both the first class of application and the second class of application. For example, any of the
various waveforms described herein, e.g., minitap, microtap, tap, sine wave, etc. Figure 5,
described above, depicts examples of various haptic waveform morphologies.
[0556]       Device 100 is configured to generate 3010, 3020 different alerts according to
some embodiments. The different alerts include a first subset of two or more alerts that
include audio components that are available to the first class of applications and are not
available to the second class of applications. For example, certain audio components may be
designated for use by first party applications, and not available for use by third party
applications. The different alerts also include a second subset of two or more alerts that
include audio components that are available to the second class of applications and are
composed from the audio waveform that is designated for use by the second class of

applications. For example, a particular audio waveform may be specific for use by third
party applications, and thus provide a consistent audio characteristic of third party
applications. Figure 6, described above, depicts examples of various audio waveform
morphologies.
[0557]      According to some embodiments, the second subset of alerts include two alerts
generated by applying different transformations to the same respective audio sample (e.g., a
natural audio sample that is a recording of a sound with a microphone or a synthetic audio
sample that was generated digitally) that is associated with the second class of applications.
In some embodiments, the two alerts include an alert including an audio component
generated by applying a first transformation the respective audio sample that is associated
with the second class of applications. In some embodiments, this alert is available to a
plurality of applications in the second class of applications. The two alerts also, optionally,
include a different alert including an audio component generated by applying a second
transformation to the respective audio sample that is associated with the second class of
applications, wherein the first transformation is different from the second transformation. In
some embodiments, this different alert is available to a plurality of applications in the second
class of applications. The transformations applied to the waveforms include changing the
amplitude, duration, pitch, or number of repetitions of the audio sample, for example.
[0558]      Likewise, according to some embodiments the first subset of alerts include two
alerts generated by applying different transformations to a (same) respective audio sample
that is associated with a first application in the first class of applications. In some
embodiments, the two alerts include an alert including an audio component generated by
applying a first transformation the respective audio sample that is associated with the first
application in the first class of applications (e.g., by changing an amplitude, duration, pitch,
or number of repetitions of the audio sample). In some embodiments, this alert is available to
a plurality of applications in the first class of applications. In some embodiments, this alert is
available only to the first application in the first class of applications. The two alerts also,
optionally, include a different alert including an audio component generated by applying a
second transformation to the respective audio sample that is associated with the first
application in the first class of applications, wherein the first transformation is different from
the second transformation. In some embodiments, this different alert is available to a plurality

of applications in the first class of applications. In some embodiments, this different alert is
available only to the first application in the first class of applications.
[0559]       Similarly, according to some embodiments, the first subset of alerts include two
alerts generated by applying different transformations to the same respective audio sample
that is associated with a second application in the first class of applications, wherein the
respective audio sample that is associated with the second application is different from the
respective audio sample that is associated with the first application. For example, the first
application and the second application each have characteristic sounds that serve as a "brand"
for the application, e.g., a payment application uses alerts generated with a sound sample that
is unique to the payment application so that payment success, payment failure, and account
activation for the payment application have a recognizably similar sound. By comparison, a
virtual assistant application uses alerts generated with a sound sample that is unique to the
virtual assistant application, so that virtual assistant success, virtual assistant failure, and
virtual assistant ready all have a recognizably similar sound that is different from the
recognizably similar sound of alerts for the payment application. In some embodiments, the
two alerts include an alert including an audio component generated by applying a first
transformation the respective audio sample that is associated with the second application in
the first class of applications (e.g., by changing an amplitude, duration, pitch, or number of
repetitions of the audio sample). In some embodiments, this alert is available to a plurality of
applications in the first class of applications. In some embodiments, this alert is available
only to the second application in the first class of applications. The two alerts also,
optionally, include a different alert including an audio component generated by applying a
second transformation to the respective audio sample that is associated with the second
application in the first class of applications, wherein the first transformation is different from
the second transformation. In some embodiments, this different alert is available to a
plurality of applications in the first class of applications. In some embodiments, this different
alert is available only to the second application in the first class of applications.
[0560]       Which application an alert condition is triggered within provides the basis for
generating a corresponding output, according to some embodiments. Table 14 shows
exemplary haptic and audio outputs corresponding to alerts for two different applications
(email, payment) within a single application class (first party applications). The first three
rows of the table show alerts corresponding to a first application, e.g., email. For each of the

[0562]        According to some embodiments, the second subset of alerts is not available to the
first class of applications. For example, first party applications are not allowed to use the
third party application alert sounds, and optionally vice versa. According to some
embodiments, both the first and second subsets of alerts include haptic components that are
available to the first class of applications and the second class of applications, such that both
third party applications are allowed to use shared haptic components.
[0563]        According to some embodiments, the different alerts include a third subset of two
or more alerts that include audio components that are available to the second class of
applications and the first class of applications, e.g., they are designated for shared use. For
example, an alert that simulates physical feedback, such as haptic/audio click or a haptic that
provides simulated bouncing (rubber band-like) effect that is provided in conjunction with a
user interface element such as a scrollable list view bouncing when it reaches the end of the
display might be available regardless of the class of application in use. If the application
includes a scrollable list, then the output is available for use within the application upon that
action, regardless of the application class. Thus, although third party applications have a
unique set of haptic alerts, as noted in conjunction with Table 13 above, they also can share
some of the same haptic feedback.
[0564]        According to some embodiments, the first audio component, output via the one or
more audio output devices, is composed from an audio waveform that is designated for use
by a first application (e.g., a payment application) in the first class of applications (e.g., first
party applications). For example, the audio component optionally is a unique audio sample
that is used to distinguish alerts for the first application from alerts for other applications.

application (e.g., a payment application) in the second class of applications (e.g., first party

[0567]      It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in Figure
30 have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate that the described
order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of ordinary skill in
the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations described herein.
Additionally, it should be noted that details of other processes described herein with respect
to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 700, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 2500,
2600, and 3200) are also applicable in an analogous manner to method 3000 described above
with respect to Figure 30. For example, the inputs, alert conditions, events, applications,
states, and haptic outputs described above with reference to method 3000 optionally have one
or more of the characteristics of the inputs, alert conditions, events, applications, states, and
haptic outputs described herein with reference to other methods described herein (e.g.,
methods 700, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 2500, 2600, and 3200). For brevity, these details
are not repeated here.
[0568]      Figure 31 depicts various instances of a waveform according to some
embodiments. The waveform can be haptic or audio. As shown, the waveform 3105 has
certain amplitudes 3110 associated with its features, as well as an overall duration 3115 and a
frequency 3120 between features of the waveform. Waveform 3125 is waveform 3105 with
a transformation applied that does not affect the amplitudes 3110, but results in a longer
overall duration 3130 and lower frequency 3135 between features of the waveform.
Waveform 3140 is waveform 3105 with a transformation applied that affects both the

amplitudes 3145, and results in a shorter overall duration 3150 and higher frequency 3155
between features of the waveform.
[0569]       Relating these transformed waveforms to the discussion above, waveform 3105 is
designated for use with a certain application class or application. For example, a payment
application is associated with audio waveform 3105 according to some embodiments. In this
example, alerts are generated with a sound sample that is unique to the payment application
such that waveform instance 3125 indicates that payment success, waveform instance 3140
indicates payment failure, and waveform instance 3105 indicates account activation for the
payment application. Because each waveform instance 3105, 3125, 3140 are based on the
same sound sample of waveform 3105, all three have a recognizably similar sound that the
user will come to associate with the payment application.
[0570]       In what context an alert condition is triggered provides the basis for generating a
corresponding output, according to some embodiments. Providing haptic and/or audio output
that correlates with the context allows for consistency in haptic and audio branding for the
output, and thus creates a more efficient human-machine interface, thereby reducing the
amount of time it takes for a user to perform operations, which consequently reduces energy
use and increases battery life for battery powered devices. Figure 32 is a flow diagram of a
method 3200 for detecting a first condition in a first and second context and generating
corresponding alerts including haptic and audio outputs according to some embodiments.
Note that in some embodiments, different steps may be performed other than those shown in
Figure 32.
[0571]       The method begins by, at an electronic device 100 with one or more haptic output
devices and one or more audio output devices, detecting 3205 occurrence of a first condition
in a first context at the device. For example, the condition is a failure condition and the
context of the failure event is that it occurred in a first application. According to some
embodiments, the occurrence of the condition includes one or more of the receipt of a
communication (e.g., a message from an external source), the detection of an input from a
user (e.g., a touch, voice, or mechanical input that is associated with feedback), and the
detection of the satisfaction of triggering criteria (e.g., the expiration of an alarm, as the
completion of a workout, or the like), to name a few. According to some embodiments, the
computing device 100 comprises a touch-sensitive display for receiving the user input.

    WO 2016/036447                                                            PCT/US2015/041858
[0572]       Responsive to detecting the occurrence of the first condition in the first context,
the device 100 generates 3210 a first alert corresponding to the first condition that includes a
first haptic component 3212 that indicates the type of condition that occurred (e.g., a failure
event occurred) and a first audio component 3214 that indicates that the first condition
occurred in the first context (e.g., within a particular application. According to some
embodiments, the first haptic output is provided via the touch-sensitive display on the
computing device 100.
[0573]       The device 100 also detects 3215 occurrence of the first condition in a second
context that is different from the first context (e.g., in a second application different from the
first application. Response to detecting the occurrence of the first condition in the second
context, the device 100 generates 3220 a second alert corresponding to the first condition that
includes the first haptic component 3212 that indicates that the first condition occurred, e.g.,
the same haptic component corresponding to a failure in the second application context, and a
second audio component 3222, different from the first audio component, that indicates that
the first condition occurred in the second context that is different from the first context. For
example, the failure event occurred in a second application that is different from the first
application, or the failure event includes the option for the user to submit another request for
performance of the operation that failed, and thus the audio portion of the output is different
from that of the same conditions (failure) in the first context.
[0574]       According to some embodiments, the generating 3210 of the first alert of the
method is in accordance with a determination that the alert corresponds to the first condition
having occurred in a first context, and the generating 3220 of the second alert is in
accordance with a determination that the first condition occurred in a second context.
[0575]       By keeping a consistent haptic for a condition (e.g., failure), the haptic waveform
has a semantic meaning. Similarly, the haptic meaning associated with the condition is
independent of the semantic meaning of the audio component. For example, the audio alert
provides context for the haptic alert according to some embodiments because there is a
greater dynamic range for audio than for haptic.
[0576]       According to some embodiments, the method further includes detecting 3230 the
occurrence of the first condition (e.g., failure) at the device in a third context different from
the first and second contexts. Responsive to detecting the occurrence of the first condition at
the device in the third context, the device 100 generates 3240 a third alert corresponding to
                                                - 170  -

the first condition in the third context that includes the first haptic component 3212 that
indicates the type of condition that occurred (e.g., the same haptic component indicating that
a failure event occurred) and a third audio component 3242, different from the first audio
component and the second audio component, that indicates that the first condition occurred in
the third context (e.g., the failure event occurred in a third application that is different from
the first application). According to some embodiments, the generating 3240 of the third alert
of the method is in accordance with a determination that the alert corresponds to the first
condition having occurred in a third context.
[0577]      The context in which an alert condition is triggered provides the basis for
generating a corresponding output, according to some embodiments. Table 13 shows
exemplary haptic and audio outputs corresponding to alerts for two different conditions
(success, failure), in different contexts, and across two different application classes. The first
two rows of the table show alerts corresponding to a first condition (success). For each
context of a success (payment application, email application), the output includes a first
haptic that corresponds to the condition (success), and an audio output that includes a
waveform instance corresponding to the context of the success (payment, message send).
[0578]      The third and fourth rows of the table show alerts corresponding to a second
condition (failure). For each context of a failure (payment application, email application), the
output includes a second haptic that corresponds to the condition (failure), and an audio
output that includes a waveform instance corresponding to the context of the success
(payment, message send).
[0579]      The first four rows also correspond to a first application class, first party
applications. The last two rows of the table show alerts corresponding to success and failure
conditions in the context of a second class of application, e.g., third party applications. In
this example, the application is the same, but the audio output varies because the audio
provided uses the application class as the context and provides second class waveforms 1, 2
along with the corresponding haptic for the condition (success failure). By providing haptic
output that consistently correlates with the condition (success, failure) regardless of context,
the user is provided consistency in branding for output associated with the condition, and the
audio alert provides context for the haptic alert because there is a greater dynamic range
available for audio than for haptic.

[0580]        According to some embodiments, the first haptic component indicates that an
operation requested by the user has failed to occur, the first audio component indicates that
the operation failed to occur in a first application (e.g., failure to make payment using a first
party payment application), and the second audio component indicates that the operation
failed to occur in a second application (e.g., failure to send a message in a third party
messaging application). Thus, the haptic component is shared and the audio component
varies based on the application the failure occurred in.
[0581]        According to some embodiments, the first haptic component indicates that an
operation requested by the user has successfully to occurred, the first audio component
indicates that the operation occurred in a first application and (e.g., a successful payment
using a first party payment application), and the second audio component indicates that the
operation occurred in a second application. (e.g., a successfully sent message in a third party
messaging application). Thus, the haptic component is shared and the audio component
varies based on the application the success occurred in. According to some embodiments, the
first audio component is generated based on an audio waveform that is designated for use by
a first application. In some embodiments, the audio waveform that is designated for use by
the first application is also used to generate other audio components for alerts that correspond
to the first application, e.g., as described in greater detail above in conjunction with Figure

for use by a second application that is different from the first application. In some
embodiments, the audio waveform that is designated for use by the second application is also
used to generate other audio components for alerts that correspond to the second application,
e.g., as described in greater detail above in conjunction with Figure 30.
[0582]       According to some embodiments, the first audio component is generated based on
an audio waveform that is designated for use by an application in a first class of applications.
In some embodiments, the audio waveform that is designated for use by a first party
application is also used to generate other audio components for alerts that correspond to the
first party application, e.g., as described in greater detail above in conjunction with Figure 30.
The second audio component is generated based on an audio waveform that is designated for
use by applications in a second class of applications that is different from the first class of

to the third party applications, e.g., as described in greater detail above in conjunction with
Figure 30.
[0583]       According to some embodiments, the device is configured to provide alerts that
include a haptic component and an audio component in response to a plurality of different
conditions and a plurality of different contexts. For example, the first condition is signified
by the first haptic component, and the second condition that is different than the first
condition is signified by the second haptic component that is different than the first haptic
component. In some embodiments, the first haptic component and the second haptic
component are different because they have a different duration, magnitude, or waveform. In
some embodiments, the first audio component and the second audio component are different
because they include different numbers of sequential haptic outputs. According to some
embodiments, the first context is signified by the first audio component, and the second
context that is different from the first context is signified by the second audio component that
is different from the first audio component. In some embodiments, the first audio component
and the second audio component are different because they are based on different audio
samples. In some embodiments, the first audio component and the second audio component
are different because they include different numbers of sequential notes.

[0584]       According to some embodiments, the first condition indicates success of a
requested operation and the first haptic component includes a series of haptic outputs that are
aligned with features in the first audio component. For example, the alignment may mean the
features between the haptic and audio outputs are in synch, mimic one another, and/or mirror
one another, e.g., separate haptic outputs in the haptic component are generated that
correspond to sequential notes in the audio component. For example, haptic outputs are
provided just before or during the sequential notes in the audio component, according to
some embodiments. According to some embodiments, the first condition indicates failure of a
requested operation and the first haptic component is unaligned with features in the first
audio component, e.g., haptic outputs in the haptic component are generated that do not
correspond to sequential notes in the audio component. For example, a continuous haptic
output is provided that extends across a plurality of sequential notes in the audio component.
[0585]       According to some embodiments, the first condition indicates success of a
requested operation and the first haptic component includes a series of haptic outputs that are

haptic component are generated that correspond to sequential notes in the audio component.
For example, haptic outputs are provided just before or during the sequential notes in the

generated that do not correspond to sequential notes in the audio component. For example, a
continuous haptic output is provided that extends across a plurality of sequential notes in the
audio component according to some embodiments.
[0586]       As discussed in conjunction with Figure 6, a respective haptic output may be
accompanied by a corresponding audio output, with at least a portion of the respective audio
output concurrent with at least a portion of the respective haptic output, or the respective
audio output occurs close in time to the respective haptic output so that the respective haptic
output and the respective audio output are perceptually concurrent or simultaneous. The
haptic and audio waveforms need not be perfectly aligned, and the device can take into
account the fact that for certain classes of haptic and audio outputs, the haptic and audio
outputs will be perceived by a user to be concurrent or simultaneous even if they are slightly
offset in time (e.g., because audio output is processed more quickly than haptic output, so

providing haptic output before providing audio output will, in some circumstance, cause a
user to perceive the audio and haptic output as occurring concurrently or simultaneously).
[0587]       It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in Figure
32 have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate that the described
order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of ordinary skill in
the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations described herein.
Additionally, it should be noted that details of other processes described herein with respect
to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 700, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 2500,
2600, and 3000) are also applicable in an analogous manner to method 3000 described above
with respect to Figure 32. For example, the inputs, alert conditions, events, applications,
states, and haptic outputs described above with reference to method 3000 optionally have one
or more of the characteristics of the inputs, alert conditions, events, applications, states, and
haptic outputs described herein with reference to other methods described herein (e.g.,
methods 700, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 2500, 2600, and 3000). For brevity, these details
are not repeated here.
[0588]       Figure 33a shows various haptic and audio waveforms, both separate and
concurrent in time according to some embodiments. Haptic waveform 3305 and audio
waveform 3310, for example, can be used together as the output for an alert. As shown in
combined output 3315, haptic waveform 3305 and audio waveform 3310 are not aligned and
will be perceived by the user as a haptic followed by audio followed by a haptic followed by
audio. However, haptic waveform 3305 and audio waveform 3320, when used together as
shown in combined output 3325, are aligned, such that the audio output is perceived by the
user as concurrent with the haptic output, even though the alignment is not perfect.
[0589]       Figure 33b shows various haptic and audio waveforms, overlapping in time,
according to some embodiments. Haptic waveform 3330, for example, is a haptic waveform
for a failure event according to some embodiments. The failure haptic 3330 is a sustained
buzz according to some embodiments. When failure haptic 3330 is used in conjunction with
different audio output, it signals different types of failures and/or failures in different contexts
as described in conjunction with Figure 32. Audio waveform 3335 represents a third party
audio waveform, in this example a failure audio sample that sounds like ding-ding-dun. As
shown in combined output 3340, haptic waveform 3330 and audio waveform 3335 are
aligned. Audio waveform 3345 represents a different third party audio waveform, in this

example a try again audio sample that sounds like dun-dun-dun. It is a similar audio sample
to the failure audio waveform 3335 as variations of a third party audio waveform, but has
three similar features rather than two of one feature and third one that is different. When
combined with failure haptic 3330, combined waveform 3350 results. Combined waveform
3350 shares the failure haptic 3330, but differs in context and thus audio output from audio
waveform 3335.
[0590]       Figure 33c shows various haptic and audio waveforms, overlapping in time,
according to some embodiments. Haptic waveform 3330, for example, is the same haptic
waveform for a failure event as Figure 33b, according to some embodiments. Failure haptic
3330 is used in conjunction with two different first party audio waveforms (3355, 3365) to
produce two different but relate first party alerts. Audio waveform 3355 represents a first
party audio waveform for a payment failure audio sample that sounds like de-dum, de-dum.
Combined output 3360 shows haptic waveform 3330 and audio waveform 3335 in alignment.
Audio waveform 3365 represents a different first party audio waveform, in this example a
passcode entry failure sample that sounds like de-dum, de-dum, de-dum. When combined
with failure haptic 3330, combined waveform 3370 results. Combined waveform 3370
shares the failure haptic 3330, but differs in context and thus audio output from audio
waveform 3355.
[0591]       The operations described above with reference to Figures 30 and 32 are,
optionally, implemented by components depicted in Figures 1A-1B, and 34-35. Figure 34
shows an example functional block diagram of device 100 configured in accordance with the
principles of the various described embodiments. It is understood by persons of skill in the
art that the functional blocks described in Figure 34 are, optionally, combined or separated

[0593]      The following paragraphs [0594]-[0602] describe different embodiments that may
be implemented, individually or in any combination, by the device 100 illustrated in Figure
34:
[0594]      The processing unit 3405 is configured to detect, at an electronic device with one
or more haptic output devices, occurrence of a first condition at the device (e.g., with the
detecting unit 3410), and responsive to detecting the occurrence, optionally in accordance
with a determination that the alert corresponds to a respective application in a first class of
applications, generate a first alert that corresponds to a respective application in a first class
of applications (e.g., with the alert generating unit 3415). The processing unit 3405 is also
configured to detect occurrence of a second condition at the device (e.g., with the detecting
unit 3410), and in response generate a second alert that corresponds to a respective
application in a second class of applications that is different from the first class of
applications, the second alert including a second haptic component that is output via the one
or more haptic output devices and a second audio component, output via the one or more
audio output devices, that is composed from an audio waveform that is designated for use by
applications in the second class of applications (e.g., with the alert generating unit 3415).
[0595]      According to some embodiments, the first haptic component and the second
haptic component are composed from one or more haptic waveforms that are available to
both the first class of application and the second class of application.
[0596]      According to some embodiments, the device 100 is configured to generate a
plurality of different alerts (e.g., by the alert generating unit 3415). The plurality of different
alerts includes a first subset of two or more alerts that include audio components that are
available to the first class of applications and are not available to the second class of
applications and the plurality of different alerts includes a second subset of two or more alerts
that include audio components that are available to the second class of applications and are
composed from the audio waveform that is designated for use by the second class of
applications.
[0597]      According to some embodiments, the second subset of alerts include two alerts
generated (e.g., by the alert generating unit 3415) by applying different transformations to a
respective audio sample that is associated with the second class of applications. According to
