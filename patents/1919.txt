  ABSTRACT
  Biomass (e.g., plant biomass, animal biomass, and municipal waste biomass) is processed to
  produce useful intermediates and products, such as energy, fuels, foods or materials. Two or
  more sugars can be produced and these can be further processed and purified. For example, a
5 mixture of the two or more sugars can be selectively fermented to leave one or more sugars in
  the mixture along with a product. The unfermented sugar may be fermented with a different
  fermenting system and produce a second product.

                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
     [0002]       Many potential lignocellulosic feedstocks are available today, including
     agricultural residues, woody biomass, municipal waste, oilseeds/cakes and seaweed, to
     name a few. At present, these materials are often under-utilized, being used, for
     example, as animal feed, biocompost materials, burned in a co-generation facility or even
     landfilled.
     [0003]       Lignocellulosic biomass includes crystalline cellulose fibrils embedded in a
     hemicellulose matrix, surrounded by lignin. This produces a compact matrix that is
     difficult to access by enzymes and other chemical, biochemical and/or biological
     processes. Cellulosic biomass materials (e.g., biomass material from which the lignin
     has been removed) is more accessible to enzymes and other conversion processes, but
     even so, naturally-occurring cellulosic materials often have low yields (relative to
     theoretical yields) when contacted with hydrolyzing enzymes. Lignocellulosic biomass
     is even more recalcitrant to enzyme attack. Furthermore, each type of lignocellulosic
     biomass has its own specific composition of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.
                                              SUMMARY
     [0004]       Generally, this invention relates to methods and processes for converting a
     material, such as a biomass feedstock, e.g., cellulosic, starchy or lignocellulosic
     materials, to useful products, for example, alcohols (e.g., ethanol and butanol), acids (e.
     g. acetic, propionic, butyric, succinic, D- and L-lactic, pyruvic acid) and sugars (e.g.,
     glucose and xylose). The invention also relates e.g., to methods equipment and systems
                                                     1

WO 2014/138598                                                               PCT/US2014/021813
                                                                   Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C
     for the separation of products (e.g., purification, isolation or concentration) from the
     converted biomass. For example, a mixture of two or more sugars can be fermented to
     leave one or more sugars in the mixture.
     [0005]       In one aspect the invention relates to a method of making a product. The
     method includes saccharifying, such as by using one or more enzymes, cellulosic or
     lignocellulosic material, e. g. a reduced recalcitrance cellulosic or lignocellulosic
     material, in a liquid, such as water, to form a mixture comprising two or more sugars,
     such as two or more monosaccharides. The method further includes contacting the
     saccharified material with an organism, wherein the organism selectively ferments a
     sugar released during the saccharification (e.g., including glucose and/or xylose) to
     provide one or more unfermented sugars (e.g., including glucose or xylose), fermentation
     solids and a fermentation product. Optionally, the fermentation product (e. g. an alcohol
     or an organic acid) can be isolated from one or more of the unfermented sugars and
     fermentation solids, or the fermentation product and one or more of the unfermented
     sugars can be isolated from the fermentation solids, or the fermentation product and
     fermentation solids can be isolated from one or more of the unfermented sugars.
     Optionally the methods of isolating, e.g., the fermentation product, includes filtering
     including ultrafiltration, centrifuging, evaporation, distillation, crystallization,
     precipitation, extraction, chromatography including simulated moving bed
     chromatography, electrodialysis including bipolar electodialysis and combinations of
     these. Optionally, the methods also include isolating the one or more unfermented sugars
     from the fermentation solids, for example, by filtering, centrifuging, evaporation,
     distillation, crystallization, precipitation, extraction, chromatography and combinations
     of these (e.g., in any order). Optionally, the method includes isolating lignin-derived
     compounds, such as soluble lignin-derived compounds, from the saccharified material
     prior to contacting the saccharified material with the fermenting organism.
     [0006]       In some implementations the fermentation solids can be utilized as a nutrient
     source, for example as animal feed, for human consumption or for the growth of
     organisms (such as bacteria and yeasts). Optionally, the fermentation solids (e.g., that
     can contain living organisms and/or remnants of living organisms), can be utilized for a
     second fermentation of a saccharified lignocellulosic material.
     [0007]       In some other implementations, the methods further include converting the
     one or more unfermented sugars to another product, such as when the one or more sugars
     comprise xylose and the other product comprises xylitol. The fermentation product can
                                                      2

WO 2014/138598                                                              PCT/US2014/021813
                                                                  Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C
     comprise an alcohol (e.g., ethanol). The fermenting organism can include a yeast,
     bacteria, fungi, or a mixture of organisms, such as a yeast and a bacterium.
     [0008]      In some implementations, the recalcitrance of the biomass material is reduced
     by irradiation with ionizing radiation, for example including accelerated electrons from
     an electron beam. Optionally, a total dose of radiation applied to the cellulose or
     lignocellulosic material is between about 10 Mrad and about 200 Mrad, such as between
     about 15 Mrad and about 75 Mrad or between about 20 Mrad and about 50 Mrad.
     [0009]      In implementation of the methods wherein the saccharified material includes
     two monosaccharides (e.g., glucose and xylose) dissolved in the liquids, the
     monosaccharides can include at least 50 wt.% of total carbohydrates available in the
     reduced recalcitrance cellulosic or lignocellulosic material, e.g., 60 wt.%, 70 wt.%, 80
     wt.%, 90 wt.%. Optionally, the glucose can include least 10 wt.% of the
     monosaccharides present in the saccharified material, e.g., at least 20 wt.%, 30 wt.%, 40
     wt.%, 50 wt.%, 60 wt.%, 70 wt.%, 80 wt.% or 90 wt.%.
     [0010]      In another aspect, the invention includes a method of making a product
     including producing a slurry including a liquid, a first sugar, a second sugar, and a
     saccharified cellulosic or lignocellulosic residue material produced by saccharification
     of an irradiated cellulosic or lignocellulosic material, such as by utilizing one or more
     enzymes. The method further includes fermenting the first sugar to produce a product,
     such as an alcohol. Optionally, the second sugar is produced at a concentration of at least
     about 20 g/L e.g., at least about 30 g/L, at least about 40 g/L, at least about 50 g/L, at
     least about 60 g/L, at least about 70 g/L, at least about 80 g/L, at least about 90 g/L, at
     least about 100 g/L. Optionally, the method further includes filtering the slurry to
     provide a filtrate comprising a liquid solution, such as an aqueous solution, of the second
     sugar and the residue. The method can further include isolating the product, such as an
     alcohol, from the second sugar by distilling the product and producing a distillate bottom
     comprising the second sugar.
     [0011]      Saccharified biomass can produce a mixture of products after saccharification
     that can be difficult to separate. For example, mono-saccharides, e.g., glucose and
     xylose, are often difficult to separate from each other by conventional means due to their
     chemical and physical similarities. For example, in many chromatography techniques,
     glucose and xylose elute at similar times. The selective fermentation of a sugar from a
     mixture of sugars can provide a product that is useful. In addition, the fermented product
     can have sufficiently different chemical and physical differences from the unfermented
     sugars that separation can be efficiently accomplished. For example, inoculating a
                                                    3

     saccharified biomass with an organism that produces D- or L-lactic acid or their salt
     from the glucose sugar which results in a slurry including xylose and lactic acid, which
     can isolated from each other in a straightforward manner.

     [0020]      Using the equipment, methods and systems described herein, cellulosic and
     lignocellulosic feedstock materials, for example that can be sourced from biomass (e.g.,
     plant biomass, animal biomass, paper, and municipal waste biomass) and that are often
     readily available but difficult to process, can be turned into useful products (e.g., sugars
     such as the mono saccharides xylose and glucose, and alcohols such as ethanol and
     butanol). Included are equipment, methods and systems to selectively remove one of the
     biomass-derived sugars from a mixture of sugars by fermenting the sugar and separating
     the fermentation product from the rest of the biomass-derived sugars. The methods and
     systems are therefore useful for producing pure or substantially pure (e.g., at least 90, 91,
     92, 93, 94 or 95% by weight) biomass-derived products from a biomass feedstock.

WO 2014/138598                                                              PCT/US2014/021813
                                                                 Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C
     [0021]      Biomass is a complex feedstock. For example, lignocellulosic materials
     include different combinations of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Cellulose is a
     linear polymer of glucose. Hemicellulose is any of several heteropolymers, such as
     xylan, glucuronoxylan, arabinoxylan and xyloglucan. The primary sugar monomer
     present (e.g., present in the largest concentration) in hemicellulose is xylose, although
     other monomers such as mannose, galactose, rhamnose, arabinose and glucose are
     present. Although all lignins show variation in their composition, they have been
     described as an amorphous dendritic network polymer of phenyl propene units. The
     amounts of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in a specific biomass material depends on
     the source of the biomass material. For example, wood-derived biomass can be about 38
     49% cellulose, 7-26% hemicellulose and 23-34% lignin depending on the type. Grasses
     typically are 33-38% cellulose, 24-32% hemicellulose and 17-22% lignin. Clearly,
     lignocellulosic biomass constitutes a large class of substrates.
     [0022]      Enzymes and biomass-destroying organisms that break down biomass, such
     as the cellulose, hemicellulose and/or the lignin portions of the biomass as described
     above, contain or manufacture various cellulolytic enzymes (cellulases), ligninases,
     xylanases, hemicellulases or various small molecule biomass-destroying metabolites.
     FIG. 1 provides some examples of these biomass-destroying processes. A cellulosic
     substrate is initially hydrolyzed by endoglucanases at random locations producing
     oligomeric intermediates. These intermediates are then substrates for exo-splitting
     glucanases such as cellobiohydrolase to produce cellobiose from the ends of the cellulose
     polymer. Cellobiose is a water-soluble 1,4-linked dimer of glucose. Finally, cellobiase
     cleaves cellobiose to yield glucose. In the case of hemicellulose, a xylanase (e.g.,
     hemicellulase) acts on this biopolymer and releases xylose as one of the possible
     products.
     [0023]      The enzymes as described above act on biomass in aqueous solutions,
     releasing the sugars which can dissolve in the solution. Due to the complex and diverse
     sources of the biomass, a varied mixture of sugars is often produced as a difficult-to
     separate mixture.
     [0024]      FIG. 2 shows processes for manufacturing sugars and fermentation products
     from a feedstock (e.g., cellulosic or lignocellulosic materials). In an initial step (210) the
     method includes optionally mechanically treating a cellulosic and/or lignocellulosic
     feedstock. Before and/or after this treatment, the feedstock can be treated with another
     physical treatment (212) to reduce its recalcitrance, for example irradiation, sonication,
     steam explosion, oxidation, pyrolysis, various heat treatments, such as heated water
                                                    5

WO 2014/138598                                                               PCT/US2014/021813
                                                                  Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C
     under pressure, or combinations of these, to reduce or further reduce its recalcitrance. A
     mixed sugar solution e.g., including glucose and xylose, is formed by saccharifying the
     feedstock (214). The saccharification can be, for example, accomplished efficiently by
     the addition of one or more enzymes, e.g., cellulases and/or xylanases (211). A product
     or several products can be derived from the sugar solution, for example, by fermentation
     to an alcohol (216). In particular, the product (or products) can be derived by the
     fermentation by one or more organisms that selectively ferment(s) only one sugar in the
     sugar solution. Following fermentation, the fermentation product (e.g., or products, or a
     subset of the fermentation products) can be isolated (224). One optional method of
     isolating the fermentation product, for example if the product is an alcohol, is by
     distillation. Optionally, after the fermentation product has been isolated, the materials
     (e.g., solution, mixture, slurry, solids) containing the unfermented sugars can be further
     processed (226), for example to isolate and/or purify one or more of the unfermented
     sugars. If desired, the steps of measuring lignin content (218) and setting or adjusting
     process parameters based on this measurement (220) can be performed at various stages
     of the process, for example, as described in U.S. Application Number 12/704,519, filed
     on February 11, 2011, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
     reference.
     [0025]       In some embodiments, it can be desirable to isolate the unfermented sugars
     from the solution. For example, one or more unfermented sugars can be removed from
     the fermentation product at step 224. The fermentation product can be subsequently
     removed from the solution. For example, the fermentation product can be distilled and
     the unfermented sugars remain in the distillate bottom for optional further processing.
     [0026]       In some embodiments one or more of the unfermented sugars can be
     contacted with an organism or combination of organisms that ferments the unfermented
     sugar(s) to a product, e.g., a product disclosed herein. The unfermented sugar(s) can be
     fermented prior to isolation from the fermentation product of the first sugar, for example,
     between steps 216 and 224. In one embodiment, the unfermented sugar(s) can be
     fermented after isolating the product of fermenting the first sugar, for example, after step
     224. In another embodiment, the unfermented sugar(s) can be isolated after isolation of
     the fermentation product of the first sugar, for example, after step 224, and then the
     isolated unfermented sugar can be fermented with one or more organisms.
     [0027]       Referring to Fig. 3 after saccharification the mixture is fermented at step 217
     such that only one of the sugars is fermented to form a first product within a mixture of
     at least a second (unfermented) sugar, and fermentation solids. The first product at step

WO 2014/138598                                                              PCT/US2014/021813
                                                                  Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C
     225 is isolated by any of the isolation technique described herein. Optionally, the
     fermentation solids may be separated from at least the second (unfermented) sugar at
     step 232. A second fermentation process at step 227 will convert the second sugar to a
     second product which can be isolated by any of the isolation techniques described herein
     at step 230. Examples of the first and second sugar can be glucose and xylose,
     respectively, with the glucose being converted in the first fermentation step. Alternately,
     the first sugar can be xylose and the second sugar can be glucose. In this case, the xylose
     fermentation product is the first product.
     [0028]       In an additional embodiment, FIG 4 shows the steps of physically treating a
     biomass (410); treating the feedstock to reduce recalcitrance(412), mixing in an enzyme
     (411) and saccharifying the material to form a mixture that includes sugars, for example,
     glucose and xylose(414); inoculating with a microorganism (428) which selectively
     converts one sugar e.g. to an organic acid, while retaining the other sugars (428) leading
     to fermentation (416), which leads to a mixture of a retained sugars and a desired product
     (424) and then removing the product mixture (426) to obtain a mixture of sugars and the
     desired product.
     [0029]       FIG. 5 shows steps to separate the organic acid from a sugar, in this case
     xylose (510). The purification means (520) can be a simulated moving bed
     chromatography or other purification means that can separate sugars from other
     substrates.
     [0030]       Pertaining to FIG 6 two electrodialysis steps are shown as a purification
     strategy. To the fermentation product liquid mixture which has had solids removed from
     it (610), is added a base if needed to convert the organic acid to its salt form (620) and
     electrodialysis processing is done to separate the nonionic sugars from the salts
     (including the organic acid salts). Then the salt is processed in the bipolar membrane
     electrodialysis unit (630) in which the organic acid salt is converted to its neutralized
     form and isolated from the salts.
     [0031]       The selective fermentations as mentioned above can selectively convert to a
     fermentation product most or even all of one of the sugars from available sugars derived
     from the biomass. For example, the selective fermentation can remove at least 60% (e.g.,
     at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99%, or even 100%) of one
     of the sugars, or between 60 and 99% (e.g., between 70 and 99%, between 80 and 99%,
     between 90 and 99%, between 60 and 70%, between 70 and 80%, between 80 and 90%,
     or between 70 and 90%) of one of the sugars. The sugar can be fermented in stages with

     at least 3 units, at least 1 unit), different concentrations of organism (e.g., differences in
     cell counts of more than about 10 fold, more than about 50 fold, more than about 100
     fold, more than about 500 fold, more than about 1000 fold), different agitation rates (e.g.,
     for mixers differences of at least 2 rpm, at least 5 rpm, at least 10 rpm, at least 50 rpm, at
     least 100 rpm, at least 500 rpm), different oxygenation rates (e.g., aerobic, anaerobic)
     and combinations of these. The organisms can be in various fermentation stages, for
     example producing different products (e.g., hydrogen, carbon dioxide, acids, ketones,
     alcohols or combinations thereof). There can be more than one organism producing the
     same or different fermentation products. The organisms can work synergistically, for
     example, a first organism can directly ferment the sugar, for example, to produce an acid,
     and then another organism can ferment the product of the fermentation by the first
     organism, for example, to a hydrocarbon. In some embodiments, enzymes can be
     utilized, for example, a glucose isomerase can be used to isomerize glucose to fructose
     and then an organism can be used to remove fructose and/or glucose. Some relevant uses
     of isomerase are discussed in PCT Application No. PCT/US13/71093, filed on December
     20, 2012, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
     [0032]      In some embodiments the liquids after saccharification and/or fermentation
     can be treated to remove solids, for example, by centrifugation, filtration, screening, or
     rotary vacuum filtration. For example, some methods and equipment that can be used

     addition other separation techniques can be used on the liquids, for example to remove
     ions, de-colorize. For example, chromatography, simulated moving bed chromatograph
     and electrodialysis may be especially useful to isolate the products and the intermediate
     mixtures. Some of these methods are discussed in U.S. Provisional Application No.

     nutrient rich solid (e.g., solid, semi-solid, and filter cake, particulate, extract) material.
     For example, the nutrient rich material can include cellular material from the organism as
     well as some unused nutrients added from the fermentations. The nutrient rich material
     can be further processed and/or can be sold as a product. In addition, the nutrient rich
     material can be used, directly or with further processing (e.g., sterilization, filtered,
     washed, diluted, pH adjusted) in the process, for example, as a nutrient during the
     fermentation. In some cases filtration or other means of separation (e.g., membrane
     filtration) can recover the fermentation organism in a viable (e.g., living) form. The
     recovered fermentation organism can be used to inoculate subsequent fermentations
     and/or sold.
     [0034]       In some embodiments the carbohydrates in the lignocellulosic material
     include at least two different sugars, for example, glucose and xylose. The sugars can be
     bound as part of a polymer or an oligomer. The sugars can also be present as monomers,
     dimers and/or trimers). For example, the lignocellulosic material can include cellulose,
     starch, hemicellulose, pectin and other heteropolysaccharides, oligomers of glucose,
     oligomers of xylose, dimers and trimers of glucose, dimers and trimers of xylose,
     glucose, xylose and combinations of these. The total concentration of these
     carbohydrates can be between about 10 wt.% and 90 wt.% of the dry weight biomass,
     wherein dry biomass has less than about 5 wt.% water (e.g. the total concentration of
     sugars is between about 10 wt.% and 80 wt.%, between about 10 wt.% and 60 wt.%,
     between about 10 wt.% and 50 wt.%, between about 10 wt.% and 40 wt.%, between
     about 20 wt.% and 90 wt.%, between about 20 wt.% and 80 wt.%, between about 20
     wt.% and 70 wt.%, between about 20 wt.% and 60 wt.%, between about 20 wt.% and 50

     about 30 wt.% and 50 wt.%, between about 40 wt.% and 90 wt.%, between about 40
     wt.% and 80 wt.%, between about 40 wt.% and 70 wt.%, between about 40 wt.% and 60
     wt.%, between about 50 wt.% and 100 wt.%, between about 50 wt.% and 90 wt.%,
     between about 50 wt.% and 80 wt.%, between about 50 wt.% and 70 wt.%, between

     wt.% and 80 wt.%, between about 70 wt.% and 90 wt.%,). After saccharification the
     percent of these carbohydrates in monomeric form (e.g., not as part of a polymer or
     oligomer) can be, for example, at least 50 wt. % of the total available concentration of
     the carbohydrates in the dry biomass prior to saccharification. For example, if the total
     biomass comprises 70 wt. % carbohydrates, after saccharification the monomeric sugars

     will comprise 35 wt. % of the unsaccharified biomass (50 % of the available 70 wt. %
     carbohydrates). In some implementations, after saccharification the percentage of these
     carbohydrates that are in monomeric form could be at least 60 wt. % of the total
     available concentration of the carbohydrates in the dry biomass (e.g., at least 70 wt. %, at
     least 80 wt. %, at least 90 wt. %). After saccharification, glucose (e.g., monomers) can
     be present as at least 10 wt.% of the total available concentration of the carbohydrates in
     the dry biomass (e.g., at least 10 wt.%, at least 30 wt.%, at least 40 wt.%, at least 50
     wt.%, at least 60 wt.%, at least 70 wt.%, at least 80 wt.%, at least 90 wt.%). After
     saccharification, xylose (e.g., monomers) can be present in at least 5 wt.% of the total
     available concentration of the carbohydrates in the dry biomass (e.g., at least 10 wt.%, at
     least 20 wt.%, at least 30 wt.%, at least 40 wt.%, at least 50 wt.%, at least 60 wt.%, at
     least 70 wt.% , at least 80 wt.%, at least 90 wt.%). After saccharification the combined
     wt.% of the total available concentration of the carbohydrates in the dry biomass, of
     other sugars , for example, arabinose can be less than about 10 wt.% (e.g., less than 5
     wt.%, less than 1 wt.%). After saccharification one or more of the sugars can be present
     in a concentration of at least 10 g/L (e.g., at least 20 g/L, at least 30 g/L, at least 40 g/L,
     at least 50 g/L, at least 60 g/L, at least, 70 g/L, at least 80 g/L at least 90 g/L, at least 100
     g/L) without concentrating the solution. The solution can be concentrated after
     saccharification to values at least 10% higher (e.g., at least 20%, at least 30%, at least
     50%, at least 100%, at least 200%, at least 500%, at least 1000%). The solution can even
     be concentrated to dryness (e.g., less than about 5 wt. % water). The solution after
     saccharification can also be diluted, for example, by at least 10% (e.g., at least 20%, at
     least 30%, at least 50%, at least 100%, at least 200%, at least 500%, at least 1000%).
     [0035]      After fermentation of the saccharified material a sugar (e.g., glucose or
     xylose) can be present in solution at a concentration of at least 10 g/L (e.g., at least 20
     g/L, at least 30 g/L, at least 40 g/L, at least 50 g/L, at least 60 g/L, at least, 70 g/L, at
     least 80 g/L at least 90 g/L, at least 100 g/L) without concentrating the solution. The
     solution can be concentrated or diluted similarly to the saccharified material as
     previously discussed. The solution can be further processed, for example, purified and/or
     converted to other products (e.g., by hydrogenation) as discussed below.
     [0036]      In some embodiments the methods can produce a composition that includes
     lignin-derived products between about 1 and 30 wt. %, (e.g., between about 5 and 25%,
     between about 5 and 20 wt. %), a fermentation product from a first sugar of between
     about 5 and 20% (e.g., between about 10 wt. % and 20 wt. %) and an unfermented
     second sugar of between about 1 and 10 wt. %. The composition can include at least

     less than about 50 wt.% water (e.g. less than about 40wt.% water, less than about 30
     wt.% water, less than about 20 wt.% water, less than about 10 wt.% water, less than
     about 5 wt.% water).
     BIOMASS MATERIALS
     [0037]       Lignocellulosic materials include, but are not limited to, wood, particle board,
     forestry wastes (e.g., sawdust, aspen wood, wood chips), grasses, (e.g., switchgrass,
     miscanthus, cord grass, reed canary grass), grain residues, (e.g., rice hulls, oat hulls,
     wheat chaff, barley hulls), agricultural waste (e.g., silage, canola straw, wheat straw,
     barley straw, oat straw, rice straw, jute, hemp, flax, bamboo, sisal, abaca, corn cobs, corn
     stover, soybean stover, corn fiber, alfalfa, hay, coconut hair), sugar processing residues
     (e.g., bagasse, beet pulp, agave bagasse), algae, seaweed, manure, sewage, and mixtures
     of any of these.
     [0038]       In some cases, the lignocellulosic material includes corncobs. Ground or
     hammer milled corncobs can be spread in a layer of relatively uniform thickness for
     irradiation, and after irradiation are easy to disperse in the medium for further
     processing. To facilitate harvest and collection, in some cases the entire corn plant is
     used, including the corn stalk, corn kernels, and in some cases even the root system of
     the plant.
     [0039]       Advantageously, no additional nutrients (other than a nitrogen source, e.g.,
     urea or ammonia) are required during fermentation of corncobs or cellulosic or
     lignocellulosic materials containing significant amounts of corncobs.
     [0040]       Corncobs, before and after comminution, are also easier to convey and
     disperse, and have a lesser tendency to form explosive mixtures in air than other
     cellulosic or lignocellulosic materials such as hay and grasses.
     [0041]       Cellulosic materials include, for example, paper, paper products, paper waste,
     paper pulp, pigmented papers, loaded papers, coated papers, filled papers, magazines,
     printed matter (e.g., books, catalogs, manuals, labels, calendars, greeting cards,
     brochures, prospectuses, newsprint), printer paper, polycoated paper, card stock,
     cardboard, paperboard, materials having a high a-cellulose content such as cotton, and
     mixtures of any of these. For example paper products as described in U.S. App. No.

     [0042]       Cellulosic materials can also include lignocellulosic materials which have
     been partially or fully de-lignified.
     [0043]       In some instances other biomass materials can be utilized, for example
     starchy materials. Starchy materials include starch itself, e.g., corn starch, wheat starch,
     potato starch or rice starch, a derivative of starch, or a material that includes starch, such
     as an edible food product or a crop. For example, the starchy material can be arracacha,
     buckwheat, banana, barley, cassava, kudzu, oca, sago, sorghum, regular household
     potatoes, sweet potato, taro, yams, or one or more beans, such as favas, lentils or peas.
     Blends of any two or more starchy materials are also starchy materials. Mixtures of
     starchy, cellulosic and or lignocellulosic materials can also be used. For example, a
     biomass can be an entire plant, a part of a plant or different parts of a plant, e.g., a wheat
     plant, cotton plant, a corn plant, rice plant or a tree. The starchy materials can be treated
     by any of the methods described herein.
     [0044]       Microbial materials include, but are not limited to, any naturally occurring or
     genetically modified microorganism or organism that contains or is capable of providing
     a source of carbohydrates (e.g., cellulose), for example, protists, e.g., animal protists
     (e.g., protozoa such as flagellates, amoeboids, ciliates, and sporozoa) and plant protists
     (e.g., algae such alveolates, chlorarachniophytes, cryptomonads, euglenids,
     glaucophytes, haptophytes, red algae, stramenopiles, and viridaeplantae). Other
     examples include seaweed, plankton (e.g., macroplankton, mesoplankton,
     microplankton, nanoplankton, picoplankton, and femtoplankton), phytoplankton, bacteria
     (e.g., gram positive bacteria, gram negative bacteria, and extremophiles), yeast and/or
     mixtures of these. In some instances, microbial biomass can be obtained from natural
     sources, e.g., the ocean, lakes, bodies of water, e.g., salt water or fresh water, or on land.
     Alternatively or in addition, microbial biomass can be obtained from culture systems,
     e.g., large scale dry and wet culture and fermentation systems.
     In other embodiments, the biomass materials, such as cellulosic, starchy and
     lignocellulosic feedstock materials, can be obtained from transgenic microorganisms and
     plants that have been modified with respect to a wild type variety. Such modifications
     may be, for example, through the iterative steps of selection and breeding to obtain
     desired traits in a plant. Furthermore, the plants can have had genetic material removed,
     modified, silenced and/or added with respect to the wild type variety. For example,
     genetically modified plants can be produced by recombinant DNA methods, where
     genetic modifications include introducing or modifying specific genes from parental
     varieties, or, for example, by using transgenic breeding wherein a specific gene or genes

     are introduced to a plant from a different species of plant and/or bacteria. Another way
     to create genetic variation is through mutation breeding wherein new alleles are
     artificially created from endogenous genes. The artificial genes can be created by a
     variety of ways including treating the plant or seeds with, for example, chemical
     mutagens (e.g., using alkylating agents, epoxides, alkaloids, peroxides, formaldehyde),
     irradiation (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, beta particles, alpha particles, protons,
     deuterons, UV radiation) and temperature shocking or other external stressing and
     subsequent selection techniques. Other methods of providing modified genes is through
     error prone PCR and DNA shuffling followed by insertion of the desired modified DNA
     into the desired plant or seed. Methods of introducing the desired genetic variation in the
     seed or plant include, for example, the use of a bacterial carrier, biolistics, calcium
     phosphate precipitation, electroporation, gene splicing, gene silencing, lipofection,
     microinjection and viral carriers. Additional genetically modified materials have been
     described in U.S. Application Serial No 13/396,369 filed February 14, 2012, the full

     herein can be practiced with mixtures of any biomass materials described herein.
     BIOMASS MATERIAL PREPARATION - MECHANICAL TREATMENTS
     [0045]       The biomass can be in a dry form, for example with less than about 35%
     moisture content (e.g., less than about 20 %, less than about 15 %, less than about 10 %
     less than about 5 %, less than about 4%, less than about 3 %, less than about 2 % or
     even less than about 1 %). The biomass can also be delivered in a wet state, for example
     as a wet solid, a slurry or a suspension with at least about 10 wt.% solids (e.g., at least
     about 20 wt.%, at least about 30 wt. %, at least about 40 wt.%, at least about 50 wt.%, at
     least about 60 wt.%, at least about 70 wt.%).
     [0046]       The processes disclosed herein can utilize low bulk density materials, for
     example cellulosic or lignocellulosic feedstocks that have been physically pretreated to
     have a bulk density of less than about 0.75 g/cm3 , e.g., less than about 0.7, 0.65, 0.60,
     0.50, 0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05 or less, e.g., less than about 0.025 g/cm 3. Bulk
     density is determined using ASTM D1895B. Briefly, the method involves filling a
     measuring cylinder of known volume with a sample and obtaining a weight of the
     sample. The bulk density is calculated by dividing the weight of the sample in grams by
     the known volume of the cylinder in cubic centimeters. If desired, low bulk density
     materials can be densified, for example, by methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,971,809

     [0047]      In some cases, the pre-treatment processing includes screening of the biomass
     material. Screening can be through a mesh or perforated plate with a desired opening
     size, for example, less than about 6.35 mm (1/4 inch, 0.25 inch), (e.g., less than about
     3.18 mm (1/8 inch, 0.125 inch), less than about 1.59 mm (1/16 inch, 0.0625 inch), is less
     than about 0.79 mm (1/32 inch, 0.03125 inch), e.g., less than about 0.51 mm (1/50 inch,
     0.02000 inch), less than about 0.40 mm (1/64 inch, 0.015625 inch), less than about 0.23
     mm (0.009 inch), less than about 0.20 mm (1/128 inch, 0.0078125 inch), less than about
     0.18 mm (0.007 inch), less than about 0.13 mm (0.005 inch), or even less than about 0.10
     mm (1/256 inch, 0.00390625 inch)). In one configuration the desired biomass falls
     through the perforations or screen and thus biomass larger than the perforations or screen
     are not irradiated. These larger materials can be re-processed, for example, by
     comminuting, or they can simply be removed from processing. In another configuration
     material that is larger than the perforations is irradiated and the smaller material is
     removed by the screening process or recycled. In this kind of a configuration, the
     conveyor itself (for example a part of the conveyor) can be perforated or made with a
     mesh. For example, in one particular embodiment the biomass material may be wet and
     the perforations or mesh allow water to drain away from the biomass before irradiation.
     [0048]      Screening of material can also be by a manual method, for example, by an
     operator or mechanoid (e.g., a robot equipped with a color, reflectivity or other sensor)
     that removes unwanted material. Screening can also be by magnetic screening wherein a
     magnet is disposed near the conveyed material and the magnetic material is removed
     magnetically.
     [0049]        For example, a portion of the conveying trough can be heated by use of a
     heating jacket. Heating can be, for example, for the purpose of drying the material. In
     the case of drying the material, this can also be facilitated, with or without heating, by
     the movement of a gas (e.g., air, oxygen, nitrogen, He, C0 2 , Argon) over and/or through
     the biomass as it is being conveyed. Optionally, pre-treatment processing can include
     cooling the material. Cooling material is described in US Pat. No. 7,900,857 to Medoff,
     the disclosure of which in incorporated herein by reference. For example, cooling can be
     by supplying a cooling fluid, for example water (e.g., with glycerol), or nitrogen (e.g.,
     liquid nitrogen) to the bottom of the conveying trough. Alternatively, a cooling gas, for
     example, chilled nitrogen can be blown over the biomass materials or under the
     conveying system.
     [0050]      Another optional pre-treatment processing method can include adding a
     material to the biomass. The additional material can be added by, for example, by

     showering, sprinkling and or pouring the material onto the biomass as it is conveyed.
     Materials that can be added include, for example, metals, ceramics and/or ions as
     described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2010/0105119 Al (filed October 26, 2009) and U.S.
     Pat. App. Pub. 2010/0159569 Al (filed December 16, 2009), the entire disclosures of
     which are incorporated herein by reference. Optional materials that can be added include
     acids and bases. Other materials that can be added are oxidants (e.g., peroxides,
     chlorates), polymers, polymerizable monomers (e.g., containing unsaturated bonds),
     water, catalysts, enzymes and/or organisms. Materials can be added, for example, in
     pure form, as a solution in a solvent (e.g., water or an organic solvent) and/or as a
     solution. In some cases the solvent is volatile and can be made to evaporate e.g., by
     heating and/or blowing gas as previously described. The added material may form a
     uniform coating on the biomass or be a homogeneous mixture of different components
     (e.g., biomass and additional material). The added material can modulate the optional
     subsequent irradiation step by increasing the efficiency of the irradiation, damping the
     irradiation or changing the effect of the irradiation (e.g., from electron beams to X-rays
     or heat). The method may have no impact on the irradiation but may be useful for
     further downstream processing. The added material may help in conveying the material,
     for example, by lowering dust levels.
     [0051]      Biomass can be delivered to the conveyor (e.g., the vibratory conveyors used
     in the vaults herein described) by a belt conveyor, a pneumatic conveyor, a screw
     conveyor, a hopper, a pipe, manually or by a combination of these. The biomass can, for
     example, be dropped, poured and/or placed onto the conveyor by any of these methods.
     In some embodiments the material is delivered to the conveyor using an enclosed
     material distribution system to help maintain a low oxygen atmosphere and/or control
     dust and fines. Lofted or air suspended biomass fines and dust are undesirable because
     these can form an explosion hazard or damage the window foils of an electron gun (if
     such a device is used for treating the material).
     [0052]      The material can be leveled to form a uniform thickness between about
     0.0312 and 5 inches (e.g., between about 0.0625 and 2.000 inches, between about 0.125
     and 1 inches, between about 0.125 and 0.5 inches, between about 0.3 and 0.9 inches,
     between about 0.2 and 0.5 inches between about 0.25 and 1.0 inches, between about 0.25
     and 0.5 inches.
     [0053]      In some cases, the mechanical treatment may include an initial preparation of
     the feedstock as received, e.g., size reduction of materials, such as by comminution, e.g.,
     cutting, grinding, shearing, pulverizing or chopping. For example, in some cases, loose

     feedstock (e.g., recycled paper, starchy materials, or switchgrass) is prepared by shearing
     or shredding. Mechanical treatment may reduce the bulk density of the carbohydrate
     containing material, increase the surface area of the carbohydrate-containing material
     and/or decrease one or more dimensions of the carbohydrate-containing material.
     [0054]       Alternatively, or in addition, the feedstock material can be treated with
     another treatment, for example chemical treatments, such as with an acid (HCl, H2SO4,
     H 3 PO4), a base (e.g., KOH and NaOH), a chemical oxidant (e.g., peroxides, chlorates,
     ozone), irradiation, steam explosion, pyrolysis, sonication, oxidation, chemical treatment.
     The treatments can be in any order and in any sequence and combinations. For example,
     the feedstock material can first be physically treated by one or more treatment methods,
     e.g., chemical treatment including and in combination with acid hydrolysis (e.g., utilizing
     HCl, H2SO4, H 3 PO4), radiation, sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis or steam explosion, and
     then mechanically treated. This sequence can be advantageous since materials treated by
     one or more of the other treatments, e.g., irradiation or pyrolysis, tend to be more brittle
     and, therefore, it may be easier to further change the structure of the material by
     mechanical treatment. As another example, a feedstock material can be conveyed
     through ionizing radiation using a conveyor as described herein and then mechanically
     treated. Chemical treatment can remove some or all of the lignin (for example chemical
     pulping) and can partially or completely hydrolyze the material. The methods also can
     be used with pre-hydrolyzed material. The methods also can be used with material that
     has not been pre hydrolyzed. The methods can be used with mixtures of hydrolyzed and
     non-hydrolyzed materials, for example, with about 50% or more non-hydrolyzed
     material, with about 60% or more non- hydrolyzed material, with about 70% or more
     non-hydrolyzed material, with about 80% or more non-hydrolyzed material or even with
     90% or more non-hydrolyzed material.
     [0055]       In addition to size reduction, which can be performed initially and/or later in
     processing, mechanical treatment can also be advantageous for "opening up,"
     "stressing," breaking or shattering the carbohydrate-containing materials, making the
     cellulose of the materials more susceptible to chain scission and/or disruption of
     crystalline structure during the physical treatment.
     [0056]       Methods of mechanically treating the carbohydrate-containing material
     include, for example, milling or grinding. Milling may be performed using, for example,
     a hammer mill, ball mill, colloid mill, conical or cone mill, disk mill, edge mill, Wiley
     mill, grist mill or other mill. Grinding may be performed using, for example, a
     cutting/impact type grinder. Some exemplary grinders include stone grinders, pin
                                                     16

     grinders, coffee grinders, and burr grinders. Grinding or milling may be provided, for
     example, by a reciprocating pin or other element, as is the case in a pin mill. Other
     mechanical treatment methods include mechanical ripping or tearing, other methods that
     apply pressure to the fibers, and air attrition milling. Suitable mechanical treatments
     further include any other technique that continues the disruption of the internal structure
     of the material that was initiated by the previous processing steps.
     [0057]       Mechanical feed preparation systems can be configured to produce streams
     with specific characteristics such as, for example, specific maximum sizes, specific
     length-to-width, or specific surface areas ratios. Physical preparation can increase the
     rate of reactions, improve the movement of material on a conveyor, improve the
     irradiation profile of the material, improve the radiation uniformity of the material, or
     reduce the processing time required by opening up the materials and making them more
     accessible to processes and/or reagents, such as reagents in a solution.
     [0058]       The bulk density of feedstocks can be controlled (e.g., increased). In some
     situations, it can be desirable to prepare a low bulk density material, e.g., by densifying
     the material (e.g., densification can make it easier and less costly to transport to another
     site) and then reverting the material to a lower bulk density state (e.g., after transport).
     The material can be densified, for example, from less than about 0.2 g/cc to more than
     about 0.9 g/cc (e.g., less than about 0.3 to more than about 0.5 g/cc, less than about 0.3 to
     more than about 0.9 g/cc, less than about 0.5 to more than about 0.9 g/cc, less than about
     0.3 to more than about 0.8 g/cc, less than about 0.2 to more than about 0.5 g/cc). For
     example, the material can be densified by the methods and equipment disclosed in U.S.
     Pat. No. 7,932,065 to Medoff and International Publication No. WO 2008/073186
     (which was filed October 26, 2007, was published in English, and which designated the
     United States), the full disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
     Densified materials can be processed by any of the methods described herein, or any
     material processed by any of the methods described herein can be subsequently
     densified.
     [0059]       In some embodiments, the material to be processed is in the form of a fibrous
     material that includes fibers provided by shearing a fiber source. For example, the
     shearing can be performed with a rotary knife cutter.
     [0060]       For example, a fiber source, e.g., that is recalcitrant or that has had its
     recalcitrance level reduced, can be sheared, e.g., in a rotary knife cutter, to provide a first
     fibrous material. The first fibrous material is passed through a first screen, e.g., having
     an average opening size of 1.59 mm or less (1/16 inch, 0.0625 inch), provide a second
                                                    17

WO 2014/138598                                                               PCT/US2014/021813
                                                                   Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C
     fibrous material. If desired, the fiber source can be cut prior to the shearing, e.g., with a
     shredder. For example, when a paper is used as the fiber source, the paper can be first
     cut into strips that are, e.g., 1/4- to 1/2-inch wide, using a shredder, e.g., a counter
     rotating screw shredder, such as those manufactured by Munson (Utica, N.Y.). As an
     alternative to shredding, the paper can be reduced in size by cutting to a desired size
     using a guillotine cutter. For example, the guillotine cutter can be used to cut the paper
     into sheets that are, e.g., 10 inches wide by 12 inches long.
     [0061]       In some embodiments, the shearing of the fiber source and the passing of the
     resulting first fibrous material through a first screen are performed concurrently. The
     shearing and the passing can also be performed in a batch-type process.
     [0062]       For example, a rotary knife cutter can be used to concurrently shear the fiber
     source and screen the first fibrous material. A rotary knife cutter includes a hopper that
     can be loaded with a shredded fiber source prepared by shredding a fiber source.
     [0063]       In some implementations, the feedstock is physically treated prior to
     saccharification and/or fermentation. Physical treatment processes can include one or
     more of any of those described herein, such as mechanical treatment, chemical treatment,
     irradiation, sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis or steam explosion. Treatment methods can
     be used in combinations of two, three, four, or even all of these technologies (in any
     order). When more than one treatment method is used, the methods can be applied at the
     same time or at different times. Other processes that change a molecular structure of a
     biomass feedstock may also be used, alone or in combination with the processes
     disclosed herein.
     [0064]       Mechanical treatments that may be used, and the characteristics of the
     mechanically treated carbohydrate-containing materials, are described in further detail in

     RADIATION TREATMENT
     [0065]       The feedstock can be treated with radiation to modify its structure to reduce
     its recalcitrance. Such treatment can, for example, reduce the average molecular weight
     of the feedstock, change the crystalline structure of the feedstock, and/or increase the
     surface area and/or porosity of the feedstock. Radiation can be by, for example electron
     beam, ion beam, 100 nm to 28 nm ultraviolet (UV) light, gamma or X-ray radiation.
     Radiation treatments and systems for treatments are discussed in US. Patent 8,142,620

                                                                  Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C

     incorporated herein by reference.
     [0066]      Each form of radiation ionizes the biomass via particular interactions, as
     determined by the energy of the radiation. Heavy charged particles primarily ionize
     matter via Coulomb scattering; furthermore, these interactions produce energetic
     electrons that may further ionize matter. Alpha particles are identical to the nucleus of a
     helium atom and are produced by the alpha decay of various radioactive nuclei, such as
     isotopes of bismuth, polonium, astatine, radon, francium, radium, several actinides, such
     as actinium, thorium, uranium, neptunium, curium, californium, americium, and
     plutonium. Electrons interact via Coulomb scattering and bremsstrahlung radiation
     produced by changes in the velocity of electrons.
     [0067]      When particles are utilized, they can be neutral (uncharged), positively
     charged or negatively charged. When charged, the charged particles can bear a single
     positive or negative charge, or multiple charges, e.g., one, two, three or even four or
     more charges. In instances in which chain scission is desired to change the molecular
     structure of the carbohydrate containing material, positively charged particles may be
     desirable, in part, due to their acidic nature. When particles are utilized, the particles can
     have the mass of a resting electron, or greater, e.g., 500, 1000, 1500, or 2000 or more
     times the mass of a resting electron. For example, the particles can have a mass of from
     about 1 atomic unit to about 150 atomic units, e.g., from about 1 atomic unit to about 50
     atomic units, or from about I to about 25, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12 or 15 atomic units.
     [0068]      Gamma radiation has the advantage of a significant penetration depth into a
     variety of material in the sample.
     [0069]      In embodiments in which the irradiating is performed with electromagnetic
     radiation, the electromagnetic radiation can have, e.g., energy per photon (in electron
     volts) of greater than 102 eV, e.g., greater than 103, 104, 105, 106, or even greater than
     107 eV. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation has energy per photon of
     between 104 and 107, e.g., between 105 and 106 eV. The electromagnetic radiation can
     have a frequency of, e.g., greater than 1016 Hz, greater than 1017 Hz, 1018, 1019, 1020,
     or even greater than 1021 Hz. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation has a
     frequency of between 1018 and 1022 Hz, e.g., between 1019 to 1021 Hz.
     [0070]      Electron bombardment may be performed using an electron beam device that
     has a nominal energy of less than 10 MeV, e.g., less than 7 MeV, less than 5 MeV, or
     less than 2 MeV, e.g., from about 0.5 to 1.5 MeV, from about 0.8 to 1.8 MeV, or from
                                                    19

WO 2014/138598                                                                PCT/US2014/021813
                                                                   Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C
     about 0.7 to 1 MeV. In some implementations the nominal energy is about 500 to 800
     keV.
     [0071]      The electron beam may have a relatively high total beam power (the
     combined beam power of all accelerating heads, or, if multiple accelerators are used, of
     all accelerators and all heads), e.g., at least 25 kW, e.g., at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 65, 70, 80,
     100, 125, or 150 kW. In some cases, the power is even as high as 500 kW, 750 kW, or
     even 1000 kW or more. In some cases the electron beam has a beam power of 1200 kW
     or more, e.g., 1400, 1600, 1800, or even 3000 kW.
     [0072]      This high total beam power is usually achieved by utilizing multiple
     accelerating heads. For example, the electron beam device may include two, four, or
     more accelerating heads. The use of multiple heads, each of which has a relatively low
     beam power, prevents excessive temperature rise in the material, thereby preventing
     burning of the material, and also increases the uniformity of the dose through the
     thickness of the layer of material.
     [0073]      It is generally preferred that the bed of biomass material has a relatively
     uniform thickness. In some embodiments the thickness is less than about 1 inch (e.g.,
     less than about 0.75 inches, less than about 0.5 inches, less than about 0.25 inches, less
     than about 0.1 inches, between about 0.1 and 1 inch, between about 0.2 and 0.3 inches).
     [0074]      It is desirable to treat the material as quickly as possible. In general, it is
     preferred that treatment be performed at a dose rate of greater than about 0.25 Mrad per
     second, e.g., greater than about 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, or even greater than
     about 20 Mrad per second, e.g., about 0.25 to 2 Mrad per second. Higher dose rates
     allow a higher throughput for a target (e.g., the desired) dose. Higher dose rates generally
     require higher line speeds, to avoid thermal decomposition of the material. In one
     implementation, the accelerator is set for 3 MeV, 50 mA beam current, and the line
     speed is 24 feet/minute, for a sample thickness of about 20 mm (e.g., comminuted corn
     cob material with a bulk density of 0.5 g/cm3).
     [0075]      In some embodiments, electron bombardment is performed until the material
     receives a total dose of at least 0.1 Mrad, 0.25 Mrad, 1 Mrad, 5 Mrad, e.g., at least 10,
     20, 30 or at least 40 Mrad. In some embodiments, the treatment is performed until the
     material receives a dose of from about 10 Mrad to about 50 Mrad, e.g., from about 20
     Mrad to about 40 Mrad, or from about 25 Mrad to about 30 Mrad. In some
     implementations, a total dose of 25 to 35 Mrad is preferred, applied ideally over a couple
     of passes, e.g., at 5 Mrad/pass with each pass being applied for about one second.

     Cooling methods, systems and equipment can be utilized before, after, during and/or
     between irradiations (e.g., cooled screw conveyors and cooled vibratory conveyors).
     [0076]       Using multiple heads as discussed above, the material can be treated in
     multiple passes, for example, two passes at 10 to 20 Mrad/pass, e.g., 12 to 18 Mrad/pass,
     separated by a few seconds of cool-down, or three passes of 7 to 12 Mrad/pass, e.g., 5 to
     20 Mrad/pass, 10 to 40 Mrad/pass, 9 to 11 Mrad/pass. As discussed herein, treating the
     material with several relatively low doses, rather than one high dose, tends to prevent
     overheating of the material and also increases dose uniformity through the thickness of
     the material. In some implementations, the material is stirred or otherwise mixed during
     or after each pass and then smoothed into a uniform layer again before the next pass, to
     further enhance treatment uniformity.
     [0077]       In some embodiments, electrons are accelerated to, for example, a speed of
     greater than 75 percent of the speed of light, e.g., greater than 85, 90, 95, or 99 percent of
     the speed of light.
     [0078]       In some embodiments, any processing described herein occurs on
     lignocellulosic material that remains dry as acquired or that has been dried, e.g., using
     heat and/or reduced pressure. For example, in some embodiments, the cellulosic and/or
     lignocellulosic material has less than about 25 wt. % retained water, measured at 25 C
     and at fifty percent relative humidity (e.g., less than about 20 wt.%, less than about 15
     wt.%, less than about 14 wt.%, less than about 13 wt.%, less than about 12 wt.%, less
     than about 10 wt.%, less than about 9 wt.%, less than about 8 wt.%, less than about 7
     wt.%, less than about 6 wt.%, less than about 5 wt.%, less than about 4 wt.%, less than
     about 3 wt.%, less than about 2 wt.%, less than about 1 wt.%, or less than about 0.5
     wt.%.
     [0079]       In some embodiments, two or more ionizing sources can be used, such as two
     or more electron sources. For example, samples can be treated, in any order, with a
     beam of electrons, followed by gamma radiation and UV light having wavelengths from
     about 100 nm to about 280 nm. In some embodiments, samples are treated with three
     ionizing radiation sources, such as a beam of electrons, gamma radiation, and energetic
     UV light. The biomass is conveyed through the treatment zone where it can be
     bombarded with electrons.
     [0080]       It may be advantageous to repeat the treatment to more thoroughly reduce the
     recalcitrance of the biomass and/or further modify the biomass. In particular the process
     parameters can be adjusted after a first (e.g., second, third, fourth or more) pass
     depending on the recalcitrance of the material. In some embodiments, a conveyor can be

                                                                    Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C
     used which includes a circular system where the biomass is conveyed multiple times
     through the various processes described above. In some other embodiments multiple
     treatment devices (e.g., electron beam generators) are used to treat the biomass multiple
     (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more) times. In yet other embodiments, a single electron beam generator
     may be the source of multiple beams (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or more beams) that can be used for
     treatment of the biomass.
     [0081]       The effectiveness in changing the molecular/supermolecular structure and/or
     reducing the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate-containing biomass depends on the
     electron energy used and the dose applied, while exposure time depends on the power
     and dose. In some embodiments, the dose rate and total dose are adjusted so as not to
     destroy (e.g., char or burn) the biomass material. For example, the carbohydrates should
     not be damaged in the processing so that they can be released from the biomass intact,
     e.g. as monomeric sugars.
     [0082]       In some embodiments, the treatment (with any electron source or a
     combination of sources) is performed until the material receives a dose of at least about
     0.05 Mrad, e.g., at least about 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 15, 20, 25, 30,
     40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 125, 150, 175, or 200 Mrad. In some embodiments, the
     treatment is performed until the material receives a dose of between 0.1-100 Mrad, 1
     200, 5-200, 10-200, 5-150, 50-150 Mrad, 5-100, 5-50, 5-40, 10-50, 10-75, 15-50, 20-35
     Mrad.
     [0083]       In some embodiments, relatively low doses of radiation are utilized, e.g., to
     increase the molecular weight of a cellulosic or lignocellulosic material (with any
     radiation source or a combination of sources described herein). For example, a dose of at
     least about 0.05 Mrad, e.g., at least about 0.1 Mrad or at least about 0.25, 0.5, 0.75. 1.0,
     1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, or at least about 5.0 Mrad. In some embodiments, the
     irradiation is performed until the material receives a dose of between 0. 1Mrad and 2.0
     Mrad, e.g., between 0.5Mrad and 4.0 Mrad or between 1.0 Mrad and 3.0 Mrad.
     It also can be desirable to irradiate from multiple directions, simultaneously or
     sequentially, in order to achieve a desired degree of penetration of radiation into the
     material. For example, depending on the density and moisture content of the material,
     such as wood, and the type of radiation source used (e.g., gamma or electron beam), the
     maximum penetration of radiation into the material may be only about 0.75 inch. In such
     instances, a thicker section (up to 1.5 inch) can be irradiated by first irradiating the
     material from one side, and then turning the material over and irradiating from the other
     side. Irradiation from multiple directions can be particularly useful with electron beam
                                                      22

     great a penetration depth.
     RADIATION OPAQUE MATERIALS
     [0084]       The invention can include processing the material (e.g., for some of the
     processing steps) in a vault and/or bunker that is constructed using radiation opaque
     materials. In some implementations, the radiation opaque materials are selected to be
     capable of shielding the components from X-rays with high energy (short wavelength),
     which can penetrate many materials. One important factor in designing a radiation
     shielding enclosure is the attenuation length of the materials used, which will determine
     the required thickness for a particular material, blend of materials, or layered structure.
     The attenuation length is the penetration distance at which the radiation is reduced to
     approximately l/e (e = Euler's number) times that of the incident radiation. Although
     virtually all materials are radiation opaque if thick enough, materials containing a high
     compositional percentage (e.g., density) of elements that have a high Z value (atomic
     number) have a shorter radiation attenuation length and thus if such materials are used a
     thinner, lighter shielding can be provided. Examples of high Z value materials that are
     used in radiation shielding are tantalum and lead. Another important parameter in
     radiation shielding is the halving distance, which is the thickness of a particular material
     that will reduce gamma ray intensity by 50%.       As an example for X-ray radiation with
     an energy of 0.1 MeV the halving thickness is about 15.1 mm for concrete and about 2.7
     mm for lead, while with an X-ray energy of 1 MeV the halving thickness for concrete is
     about 44.45 mm and for lead is about 7.9 mm. Radiation opaque materials can be
     materials that are thick or thin so long as they can reduce the radiation that passes
     through to the other side. Thus, if it is desired that a particular enclosure have a low wall
     thickness, e.g., for light weight or due to size constraints, the material chosen should
     have a sufficient Z value and/or attenuation length so that its halving length is less than
     or equal to the desired wall thickness of the enclosure.
     [0085]       In some cases, the radiation opaque material may be a layered material, for
     example having a layer of a higher Z value material, to provide good shielding, and a
     layer of a lower Z value material to provide other properties (e.g., structural integrity,
     impact resistance, etc.). In some cases, the layered material may be a "graded-Z"
     laminate, e.g., including a laminate in which the layers provide a gradient from high-Z
     through successively lower-Z elements. In some cases the radiation opaque materials can
     be interlocking blocks, for example, lead and/or concrete blocks can be supplied by
     NELCO Worldwide (Burlington, MA), and reconfigurable vaults can be utilized.

     [0086]      A radiation opaque material can reduce the radiation passing through a
     structure (e.g., a wall, door, ceiling, enclosure, a series of these or combinations of these)
     formed of the material by about at least about 10 %, (e.g., at least about 20%, at least
     about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about
     70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at
     least about 97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, at least about 99.9%, at least
     about 99.99%, at least about 99.999%) as compared to the incident radiation. Therefore,
     an enclosure made of a radiation opaque material can reduce the exposure of
     equipment/system/components by the same amount. Radiation opaque materials can
     include stainless steel, metals with Z values above 25 (e.g., lead, iron), concrete, dirt, and
     combinations thereof. Radiation opaque materials can include a barrier in the direction of
     the incident radiation of at least about 1mm (e.g., 5 mm, 10mm, 5 cm, 10 cm, 100cm, Im
     or even about 10 m).
     RADIATION SOURCES
     [0087]      The type of radiation determines the kinds of radiation sources used as well as
     the radiation devices and associated equipment. The methods, systems and equipment
     described herein, for example for treating materials with radiation, can utilized sources
     as described herein as well as any other useful source.
     [0088]           Sources of gamma rays include radioactive nuclei, such as isotopes of
     cobalt, calcium, technetium, chromium, gallium, indium, iodine, iron, krypton,
     samarium, selenium, sodium, thallium, and xenon.
     [0089]           Sources of X-rays include electron beam collision with metal targets, such
     as tungsten or molybdenum or alloys, or compact light sources, such as those produced
     commercially by Lyncean.
     [0090]      Alpha particles are identical to the nucleus of a helium atom and are produced
     by the alpha decay of various radioactive nuclei, such as isotopes of bismuth, polonium,
     astatine, radon, francium, radium, several actinides, such as actinium, thorium, uranium,
     neptunium, curium, californium, americium, and plutonium.
     [0091]      Sources for ultraviolet radiation include deuterium or cadmium lamps.
     [0092]      Sources for infrared radiation include sapphire, zinc, or selenide window
     ceramic lamps.

     beam sources that employ hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen gases.

     [0095]       Electrons may be produced by radioactive nuclei that undergo beta decay,
     such as isotopes of iodine, cesium, technetium, and iridium. Alternatively, an electron
     gun can be used as an electron source via thermionic emission and accelerated through
     an accelerating potential. An electron gun generates electrons, which are then
     accelerated through a large potential (e.g., greater than about 500 thousand, greater than
     about 1million, greater than about 2 million, greater than about 5 million, greater than
     about 6 million, greater than about 7 million, greater than about 8 million, greater than
     about 9 million, or even greater than 10 million volts) and then scanned magnetically in
     the x-y plane, where the electrons are initially accelerated in the z direction down the
     accelerator tube and extracted through a foil window. Scanning the electron beams is
     useful for increasing the irradiation surface when irradiating materials, e.g., a biomass,

     that is conveyed through the scanned beam. Scanning the electron beam also distributes
     the thermal load homogenously on the window and helps reduce the foil window rupture
     due to local heating by the electron beam. Window foil rupture is a cause of significant
     down-time due to subsequent necessary repairs and re-starting the electron gun.
     [0096]       Various other irradiating devices may be used in the methods disclosed
     herein, including field ionization sources, electrostatic ion separators, field ionization
     generators, thermionic emission sources, microwave discharge ion sources, recirculating
     or static accelerators, dynamic linear accelerators, van de Graaff accelerators, and folded
     tandem accelerators. Such devices are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,931,784
     to Medoff, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
     [0097]       A beam of electrons can be used as the radiation source. A beam of electrons
     has the advantages of high dose rates (e.g., 1, 5, or even 10 Mrad per second), high
     throughput, less containment, and less confinement equipment. Electron beams can also
     have high electrical efficiency (e.g., 80%), allowing for lower energy usage relative to
     other radiation methods, which can translate into a lower cost of operation and lower
     greenhouse gas emissions corresponding to the smaller amount of energy used. Electron
     beams can be generated, e.g., by electrostatic generators, cascade generators, transformer
     generators, low energy accelerators with a scanning system, low energy accelerators with
     a linear cathode, linear accelerators, and pulsed accelerators.
     [0098]       Electrons can also be more efficient at causing changes in the molecular
     structure of carbohydrate-containing materials, for example, by the mechanism of chain
     scission. In addition, electrons having energies of 0.5-10 MeV can penetrate low density
     materials, such as the biomass materials described herein, e.g., materials having a bulk
     density of less than 0.5 g/cm3, and a depth of 0.3-10 cm. Electrons as an ionizing
     radiation source can be useful, e.g., for relatively thin piles, layers or beds of materials,
     e.g., less than about 0.5 inch, e.g., less than about 0.4 inch, 0.3 inch, 0.25 inch, or less
     than about 0.1 inch. In some embodiments, the energy of each electron of the electron
     beam is from about 0.3 MeV to about 2.0 MeV (million electron volts), e.g., from about
     0.5 MeV to about 1.5 MeV, or from about 0.7 MeV to about 1.25 MeV. Methods of
     irradiating materials are discussed in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2012/0100577 Al, filed

     costs.
     The electron beam irradiation device can produce either a fixed beam or a scanning
     beam. A scanning beam may be advantageous with large scan sweep length and high
     scan speeds, as this would effectively replace a large, fixed beam width. Further,
     available sweep widths of 0.5 m, 1 m, 2 m or more are available. The scanning beam is
     preferred in most embodiments described herein because of the larger scan width and
     reduced possibility of local heating and failure of the windows.
     ELECTRON GUNS - WINDOWS
     [00100]      The extraction system for an electron accelerator can include two window
     foils. The cooling gas in the two foil window extraction system can be a purge gas or a
     mixture, for example air, or a pure gas. In one embodiment the gas is an inert gas such
     as nitrogen, argon, helium and or carbon dioxide. It is preferred to use a gas rather than a
     liquid since energy losses to the electron beam are minimized. Mixtures of pure gas can
     also be used, either pre-mixed or mixed in line prior to impinging on the windows or in
     the space between the windows. The cooling gas can be cooled, for example, by using a
     heat exchange system (e.g., a chiller) and/or by using boil off from a condensed gas (e.g.,
     liquid nitrogen, liquid helium). Window foils are described in PCT/US2013/64332 filed

     [00101]      When using an enclosure, the enclosed conveyor can also be purged with an
     inert gas so as to maintain an atmosphere at a reduced oxygen level. Keeping oxygen
     levels low avoids the formation of ozone which in some instances is undesirable due to
     its reactive and toxic nature. For example the oxygen can be less than about 20% (e.g.,
     less than about 10%, less than about 1%, less than about 0.1%, less than about 0.01%, or
     even less than about 0.001% oxygen). Purging can be done with an inert gas including,
     but not limited to, nitrogen, argon, helium or carbon dioxide. This can be supplied, for
     example, from a boil off of a liquid source (e.g., liquid nitrogen or helium), generated or
     separated from air in situ, or supplied from tanks. The inert gas can be recirculated and
     any residual oxygen can be removed using a catalyst, such as a copper catalyst bed.
     Alternatively, combinations of purging, recirculating and oxygen removal can be done to
     keep the oxygen levels low.
     [00102]      The enclosure can also be purged with a reactive gas that can react with the
     biomass. This can be done before, during or after the irradiation process. The reactive

     phosphines, arsines, sulfides, thiols, boranes and/or hydrides. The reactive gas can be
     activated in the enclosure, e.g., by irradiation (e.g., electron beam, UV irradiation,
     microwave irradiation, heating, IR radiation), so that it reacts with the biomass. The
     biomass itself can be activated, for example by irradiation. Preferably the biomass is
     activated by the electron beam, to produce radicals which then react with the activated or
     unactivated reactive gas, e.g., by radical coupling or quenching.
     [00103]     Purging gases supplied to an enclosed conveyor can also be cooled, for
     example below about 25'C, below about 00 C, below about -40'C, below about -80'C,
     below about -120'C. For example, the gas can be boiled off from a compressed gas such
     as liquid nitrogen or sublimed from solid carbon dioxide. As an alternative example, the
     gas can be cooled by a chiller or part of or the entire conveyor can be cooled.
     HEATING AND THROUGHPUT DURING RADIATION TREATMENT
     [00104]     Several processes can occur in biomass when electrons from an electron beam
     interact with matter in inelastic collisions. For example, ionization of the material, chain
     scission of polymers in the material, cross linking of polymers in the material, oxidation
     of the material, generation of X-rays ("Bremsstrahlung") and vibrational excitation of
     molecules (e.g. phonon generation). Without being bound to a particular mechanism, the
     reduction in recalcitrance can be due to several of these inelastic collision effects, for
     example ionization, chain scission of polymers, oxidation and phonon generation. Some
     of the effects (e.g., especially X-ray generation), necessitate shielding and engineering
     barriers, for example, enclosing the irradiation processes in a concrete (or other radiation
     opaque material) vault. Another effect of irradiation, vibrational excitation, is equivalent
     to heating up the sample. Heating the sample by irradiation can help in recalcitrance
     reduction, but excessive heating can destroy the material, as will be explained below.
     [00105]     The adiabatic temperature rise (AT) from adsorption of ionizing radiation is
     given by the equation: AT = D/Cp: where D is the average dose in kGy, Cp is the heat
     capacity in J/g 0C, and AT is the change in temperature in 0 C. A typical dry biomass
     material will have a heat capacity close to 2. Wet biomass will have a higher heat
     capacity dependent on the amount of water since the heat capacity of water is very high      (
     4.19 J/g 0 C). Metals have much lower heat capacities, for example 304 stainless steel has
     a heat capacity of 0.5 J/g 0C. The temperature change due to the instant adsorption of

     [00107]     High temperatures can destroy and or modify the biopolymers in biomass so
     that the polymers (e.g., cellulose) are unsuitable for further processing. A biomass
     subjected to high temperatures can become dark, sticky and give off odors indicating
     decomposition. The stickiness can even make the material hard to convey. The odors can
     be unpleasant and be a safety issue. In fact, keeping the biomass below about 200 0 C has
     been found to be beneficial in the processes described herein (e.g., below about 190 0 C,
     below about 180 0 C, below about 170 0 C, below about 160 0 C, below about 150 0 C, below
     about 140 0 C, below about 130 0 C, below about 120 0 C, below about 1 100 C, between
     about 60 0 C and 180 0 C, between about 60 0 C and 160 0 C, between about 60 0 C and 150 0 C,
     between about 60 0 C and 140 0C, between about 60 0 C and 130 0 C, between about 60 0 C
     and 120 0 C, between about 80 0 C and 180 0 C, between about 100 0 C and 180 0 C, between
     about 120 0 C and 180 0 C, between about 140 0 C and 180 0 C, between about 160 0 C and
     180 0 C, between about 100 0 C and 140 0 C, between about 80 0 C and 120 0 C).
     [00108]     It has been found that irradiation above about 10 Mrad is desirable for the
     processes described herein (e.g., reduction of recalcitrance). A high throughput is also
     desirable so that the irradiation does not become a bottle neck in processing the biomass.
     The treatment is governed by a dose rate equation: M = FP/D * time, where M is the
     mass of irradiated material (Kg), F is the fraction of power that is adsorbed (unit less), P
     is the emitted power (KW=Voltage in MeV * Current in mA), time is the treatment time
     (sec) and D is the adsorbed dose (KGy). In an exemplary process where the fraction of
     adsorbed power is fixed, the Power emitted is constant and a set dosage is desired, the
     throughput (e.g., M, the biomass processed) can be increased by increasing the
     irradiation time. However, increasing the irradiation time without allowing the material

     to cool, can excessively heat the material as exemplified by the calculations shown
     above. Since biomass has a low thermal conductivity (less than about 0.1 Wm-'K-1), heat
     dissipation is slow, unlike, for example metals (greater than about 10 Wm-'K-1) which
     can dissipate energy quickly as long as there is a heat sink to transfer the energy to.
     ELECTRON GUNS - BEAM STOPS
     [00109]      In some embodiments the systems and methods include a beam stop (e.g., a
     shutter). For example, the beam stop can be used to quickly stop or reduce the
     irradiation of material without powering down the electron beam device. Alternatively
     the beam stop can be used while powering up the electron beam, e.g., the beam stop can
     stop the electron beam until a beam current of a desired level is achieved. The beam stop
     can be placed between the primary foil window and a secondary foil window. For
     example the beam stop can be mounted so that it is movable, that is, so that it can be
     moved into and out of the beam path. Even partial coverage of the beam can be used, for
     example, to control the dose of irradiation. The beam stop can be mounted to the floor,
     to a conveyor for the biomass, to a wall, to the radiation device (e.g., at the scan horn), or
     to any structural support. Preferably the beam stop is fixed in relation to the scan horn so
     that the beam can be effectively controlled by the beam stop. The beam stop can
     incorporate a hinge, a rail, wheels, slots, or other means allowing for its operation in
     moving into and out of the beam. The beam stop can be made of any material that will
     stop at least 5% of the electrons, e.g., at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, at
     least 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or even about
     100% of the electrons.
     [00110]      The beam stop can be made of a metal including, but not limited to, stainless
     steel, lead, iron, molybdenum, silver, gold, titanium, aluminum, tin, or alloys of these, or
     laminates (layered materials) made with such metals (e.g., metal-coated ceramic, metal
     coated polymer, metal-coated composite, multilayered metal materials).
     [00111]      The beam stop can be cooled, for example, with a cooling fluid such as an
     aqueous solution or a gas. The beam stop can be partially or completely hollow, for
     example with cavities. Interior spaces of the beam stop can be used for cooling fluids
     and gases. The beam stop can be of any shape, including flat, curved, round, oval,
     square, rectangular, beveled and wedged shapes.
     [00112]      The beam stop can have perforations so as to allow some electrons through,
     thus controlling (e.g., reducing) the levels of radiation across the whole area of the
     window, or in specific regions of the window. The beam stop can be a mesh formed, for

     example, from fibers or wires. Multiple beam stops can be used, together or
     independently, to control the irradiation. The beam stop can be remotely controlled, e.g.,
     by radio signal or hard wired to a motor for moving the beam into or out of position.
     SONICATION, PYROLYSIS, OXIDATION, STEAM EXPLOSION
     [00113]      If desired, one or more sonication, pyrolysis, oxidative, or steam explosion
     processes can be used instead of or in addition to irradiation to reduce or further reduce
     the recalcitrance of the carbohydrate-containing material. For example, these processes
     can be applied before, during and or after irradiation. These processes are described in
     detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,932,065 to Medoff, the full disclosure of which is incorporated
     herein by reference.
     USE OF TREATED BIOMASS MATERIAL
     [00114]      Using the methods described herein, a starting biomass material (e.g., plant
     biomass, animal biomass, paper, and municipal waste biomass) can be used as feedstock
     to produce useful intermediates and products such as organic acids, salts of organic
     acids, anhydrides, esters of organic acids and fuels, e.g., fuels for internal combustion
     engines or feedstocks for fuel cells. Systems and processes are described herein that can
     use as feedstock cellulosic and/or lignocellulosic materials that are readily available, but
     often can be difficult to process, e.g., municipal waste streams and waste paper streams,
     such as streams that include newspaper, kraft paper, corrugated paper or mixtures of
     these.
     [00115]      In order to convert the feedstock to a form that can be readily processed, the
     glucan- or xylan-containing cellulose in the feedstock can be hydrolyzed to low
     molecular weight carbohydrates, such as sugars, by a saccharifying agent, e.g., an
     enzyme or acid, a process referred to as saccharification. The low molecular weight
     carbohydrates can then be used, for example, in an existing manufacturing plant, such as
     a single cell protein plant, an enzyme manufacturing plant, or a fuel plant, e.g., an
     ethanol manufacturing facility.
     [00116]      The feedstock can be hydrolyzed using an enzyme, e.g., by combining the
     materials and the enzyme in a solvent, e.g., in an aqueous solution.
     [00117]      Alternatively, the enzymes can be supplied by organisms that break down
     biomass, such as the cellulose and/or the lignin portions of the biomass, contain or
     manufacture various cellulolytic enzymes (cellulases), ligninases or various small
                                                   31

WO 2014/138598                                                                 PCT/US2014/021813
                                                                     Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C
     molecule biomass-degrading metabolites. These enzymes may be a complex of enzymes
     that act synergistically to degrade crystalline cellulose or the lignin portions of biomass.
     Examples of cellulolytic enzymes include: endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and
     cellobiases (beta-glucosidases).
     [00118]      During saccharification a cellulosic substrate can be initially hydrolyzed by
     endoglucanases at random locations producing oligomeric intermediates. These
     intermediates are then substrates for exo-splitting glucanases such as cellobiohydrolase
     to produce cellobiose from the ends of the cellulose polymer. Cellobiose is a water
     soluble 1,4-linked dimer of glucose. Finally, cellobiase cleaves cellobiose to yield
     glucose. The efficiency (e.g., time to hydrolyze and/or completeness of hydrolysis) of
     this process depends on the recalcitrance of the cellulosic material.
     INTERMEDIATES AND PRODUCTS
     [00119]      Using the processes described herein, the biomass material can be converted
     to one or more products, such as energy, fuels, foods and materials. Specific examples
     of products include, but are not limited to, hydrogen, sugars (e.g., glucose, xylose,
     arabinose, mannose, galactose, fructose, disaccharides, oligosaccharides and
     polysaccharides), alcohols (e.g., monohydric alcohols or dihydric alcohols, such as
     ethanol, n-propanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol or n-butanol), hydrated or
     hydrous alcohols (e.g., containing greater than 10%, 20%, 30% or even greater than 40%
     water), biodiesel, organic acids (see below) , hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethane,
     propane, isobutene, pentane, n-hexane, biodiesel, bio-gasoline and mixtures thereof), co
     products (e.g., proteins, such as cellulolytic proteins (enzymes) or single cell proteins),
     and mixtures of any of these in any combination or relative concentration, and optionally
     in combination with any additives (e.g., fuel additives). Other examples include
     carboxylic acids, salts of a carboxylic acid, a mixture of carboxylic acids and salts of
     carboxylic acids and esters of carboxylic acids (e.g., methyl, ethyl and n-propyl esters),
     ketones (e.g., acetone), aldehydes (e.g., acetaldehyde), alpha and beta unsaturated acids
     (e.g., acrylic acid) and olefins (e.g., ethylene). Other alcohols and alcohol derivatives
     include propanol, propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,3-propanediol, sugar alcohols (e.g.,
     erythritol, glycol, glycerol, sorbitol threitol, arabitol, ribitol, mannitol, dulcitol, fucitol,
     iditol, isomalt, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol and other polyols), and methyl or ethyl esters of
     any of these alcohols. Other products include methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate,

     of the acids and where stereochemical isomers are possible are also included (e. g. D
     and L-lactic acid, D-, L-, and meso tartaric acid
     [00120]      Any combination of the above products with each other, and/or of the above
     products with other products, which other products may be made by the processes
     described herein or otherwise, may be packaged together and sold as products. The
     products may be combined, e.g., mixed, blended or co-dissolved, or may simply be
     packaged or sold together.
     [00121]      Any of the products or combinations of products described herein may be
     sanitized or sterilized prior to selling the products, e.g., after purification or isolation or
     even after packaging, to neutralize one or more potentially undesirable contaminants that
     could be present in the product(s). Such sanitation can be done with electron
     bombardment, for example, be at a dosage of less than about 20 Mrad, e.g., from about
     0.1 to 15 Mrad, from about 0.5 to 7 Mrad, or from about 1 to 3 Mrad.
     [00122]      The processes described herein can produce various by-product streams
     useful for generating steam and electricity to be used in other parts of the plant (co
     generation) or sold on the open market. For example, steam generated from burning by
     product streams can be used in a distillation process. As another example, electricity
     generated from burning by-product streams can be used to power electron beam
     generators used in pretreatment.
     [00123]      The by-products used to generate steam and electricity are derived from a
     number of sources throughout the process. For example, anaerobic digestion of
     wastewater can produce a biogas high in methane and a small amount of waste biomass
     (sludge). As another example, post-saccharification and/or post-distillate solids (e.g.,
     unconverted lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose remaining from the pretreatment and
     primary processes) can be used, e.g., burned, as a fuel.
     [00124]      Other intermediates and products, including food and pharmaceutical
     products, are described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2010/0124583 Al, published May 20,

     BIOMASS PROCESSING AFTER IRRADIATION
     [00125]      After irradiation the biomass may be transferred to a vessel for
     saccharification. Alternately, the biomass can be heated after the biomass is irradiated

     prior to the saccharification step. The heated means can be created, for example, by IR
     radiation, microwaves, combustion (e.g., gas, coal, oil, biomass), resistive heating and/or
     inductive coils. The heat can be applied from at least one side or more than one side, can
     be continuous or periodic and can be for only a portion of the material or all the material.
     The biomass may be heated to temperatures above 90'C in an aqueous liquid that may
     have an acid or a base present. For example, the aqueous biomass slurry may be heated
     to 90 to 150'C, alternatively, 105 to 145 0 C, optionally 110 to 140'C or further optionally
     from 115 to 135 0 C. The time that the aqueous biomass mixture is held at the peak
     temperature is 1 to 12 hours, alternately, 1 to 6 hours, optionally 1 to 4 hours at the peak
     temperature.      In some instances, the aqueous biomass mixture is acidic, and the pH is
     between 1 and 5, optionally 1 to 4, or alternately, 2 to 3. In other instances, the aqueous
     biomass mixture is alkaline and the pH is between 6 and 13, alternately, 8 to 12, or
     optionally, 8 to 11.
     SACCHARIFICATION
     [00126]      The treated biomass materials can be saccharified, generally by combining
     the material and a cellulase enzyme in a fluid or liquid medium, e.g., an aqueous
     solution. In some cases, the material is boiled, steeped, or cooked in hot water prior to
     saccharification, as described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. 2012/0100577 Al by Medoff and
     Masterman, published on April 26, 2012, the entire contents of which are incorporated
     herein.
     [00127]      The saccharification process can be partially or completely performed in a
     tank (e.g., a tank having a volume of at least 4000, 40,000, or 500,000 L) in a
     manufacturing plant, and/or can be partially or completely performed in transit, e.g., in a
     rail car, tanker truck, or in a supertanker or the hold of a ship. The time required for
     complete saccharification will depend on the process conditions and the carbohydrate
     containing material and enzyme used. If saccharification is performed in a
     manufacturing plant under controlled conditions, the cellulose may be substantially
     entirely converted to sugar, e.g., glucose in about 12-96 hours. If saccharification is
     performed partially or completely in transit, saccharification may take longer.
     [00128]      It is generally preferred that the tank contents be mixed during
     saccharification, e.g., using jet mixing as described in International App. No.

                                                                   Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C
     [00129]      The addition of surfactants can enhance the rate of saccharification.
     Examples of surfactants include non-ionic surfactants, such as a Tween@ 20 or Tween
     80 polyethylene glycol surfactants, ionic surfactants, or amphoteric surfactants.
     [00130]      It is generally preferred that the concentration of the sugar solution resulting
     from saccharification be relatively high, e.g., greater than 40%, or greater than 50, 60,
     70, 80, 90 or even greater than 95% by dry weight basis. Water may be removed, e.g.,
     by evaporation, to increase the concentration of the sugar solution. This reduces the
     volume to be shipped, and also inhibits microbial growth in the solution.
     [00131]      Alternatively, sugar solutions of lower concentrations may be used, in which
     case it may be desirable to add an antimicrobial additive, e.g., a broad spectrum
     antibiotic, in a low concentration, e.g., 50 to 150 ppm. Other suitable antibiotics include
     amphotericin B, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, hygromycin B,
     kanamycin, neomycin, penicillin, puromycin, streptomycin. Antibiotics will inhibit
     growth of microorganisms during transport and storage, and can be used at appropriate
     concentrations, e.g., between 15 and 1000 ppm by weight, e.g., between 25 and 500 ppm,
     or between 50 and 150 ppm. If desired, an antibiotic can be included even if the sugar
     concentration is relatively high. Alternatively, other additives with anti-microbial of
     preservative properties may be used. Preferably the antimicrobial additive(s) are food
     grade.
     [00132]      A relatively high concentration solution can be obtained by limiting the
     amount of water added to the carbohydrate-containing material with the enzyme. The
     concentration can be controlled, e.g., by controlling how much saccharification takes
     place. For example, concentration can be increased by adding more carbohydrate
     containing material to the solution. In order to keep the sugar that is being produced in
     solution, a surfactant can be added, e.g., one of those discussed above. Solubility can
     also be increased by increasing the temperature of the solution. For example, the
     solution can be maintained at a temperature of 40-50'C, 60-80'C, or even higher.

     enzymes may also be obtained from Chrysosporium, preferably a strain of
     Chrysosporium lucknowense. Additional strains that can be used include, but are not
     limited to, Trichoderma (particularly T. viride, T. reesei, and T. koningii), alkalophilic
     Bacillus (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,844,890 and EP Pub. No. 0 458 162), and
     Streptomyces (see, e.g., EP Pub. No. 0 458 162).
     [00134]         In addition to or in combination to enzymes, acids, bases and other chemicals
     (e.g., oxidants) can be utilized to saccharify lignocellulosic and cellulosic materials.
     These can be used in any combination or sequence (e.g., before, after and/or during
     addition of an enzyme). For example strong mineral acids can be utilized (e.g. HCl,
     H 2 SO 4 , H 3 PO 4 ) and strong bases (e.g., NaOH, KOH).
     SUGARS
     [00135]         In the processes described herein, for example after saccharification, sugars
     (e.g., glucose and xylose) can be isolated. For example sugars can be isolated by
     precipitation, crystallization, chromatography (e.g., simulated moving bed
     chromatography, high pressure chromatography), centrifugation, extraction, any other
     isolation method known in the art, and combinations thereof.
     FERMENTATION
     [00136]         Yeast and Zymomonas bacteria, for example, can be used for fermentation or
     conversion of sugar(s) to alcohol(s). Other microorganisms are discussed below. The
     optimum pH for fermentations is about pH 4 to 7. For example, the optimum pH for
     yeast is from about pH 4 to 5, while the optimum pH for Zymomonas is from about pH 5
     to 6. Typical fermentation times are about 24 to 168 hours (e.g., 24 to 96 hrs.) with
                                                      36

                                                                 Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C
     temperatures in the range of 20'C to 40'C (e.g., 26'C to 40'C), however thermophilic
     microorganisms prefer higher temperatures.
     [00137]     In some embodiments, e.g., when anaerobic organisms are used, at least a
     portion of the fermentation is conducted in the absence of oxygen, e.g., under a blanket
     of an inert gas such as N 2, Ar, He, CO 2 or mixtures thereof. Additionally, the mixture
     may have a constant purge of an inert gas flowing through the tank during part of or all
     of the fermentation. In some cases, anaerobic condition, can be achieved or maintained
     by carbon dioxide production during the fermentation and no additional inert gas is
     needed.
     [00138]     In some embodiments, all or a portion of the fermentation process can be
     interrupted before the low molecular weight sugar is completely converted to a product
     (e.g., ethanol). The intermediate fermentation products include sugar and carbohydrates
     in high concentrations. The sugars and carbohydrates can be isolated via any means
     known in the art. These intermediate fermentation products can be used in preparation of
     food for human or animal consumption. Additionally or alternatively, the intermediate
     fermentation products can be ground to a fine particle size in a stainless-steel laboratory
     mill to produce a flour-like substance. Jet mixing may be used during fermentation, and
     in some cases saccharification and fermentation are performed in the same tank.
     [00139]          Nutrients for the microorganisms may be added during saccharification
     and/or fermentation, for example the food-based nutrient packages described in U.S. Pat.
     App. Pub. 2012/0052536, filed July 15, 2011, the complete disclosure of which is
     incorporated herein by reference. In some cases, the food-based nutrient source is
     selected from the group consisting of grains, vegetables, residues of grains, residues of
     vegetables, residues of meat (e.g., stock, extract, bouillon or renderings), and mixtures
     thereof. For example, the nutrient source may be selected from the group consisting of
     wheat, oats, barley, soybeans, peas, legumes, potatoes, corn, rice bran, corn meal, wheat
     bran, meat product residues, and mixtures thereof.

     DISTILLATION
     [00149]       After fermentation, the resulting fluids can be distilled using, for example, a
     "beer column" to separate ethanol and other alcohols from the majority of water and
     residual solids. The vapor exiting the beer column can be, e.g., 35% by weight ethanol
     and can be fed to a rectification column. A mixture of nearly azeotropic (92.5%) ethanol
     and water from the rectification column can be purified to pure (99.5%) ethanol using
     vapor-phase molecular sieves. The beer column bottoms can be sent to the first effect of
     a three-effect evaporator. The rectification column reflux condenser can provide heat for
     this first effect. After the first effect, solids can be separated using a centrifuge and dried
     in a rotary dryer. A portion (25%) of the centrifuge effluent can be recycled to
     fermentation and the rest sent to the second and third evaporator effects. Most of the
     evaporator condensate can be returned to the process as fairly clean condensate with a
     small portion split off to waste water treatment to prevent build-up of low-boiling
     compounds.
     HYDROCARBON-CONTAINING MATERIALS
     [00150]       In other embodiments utilizing the methods and systems described herein,
     hydrocarbon-containing materials can be processed. Any process described herein can be

     containing materials," as used herein, is meant to include oil sands, oil shale, tar sands,
     coal dust, coal slurry, bitumen, various types of coal, and other naturally-occurring and
     synthetic materials that include both hydrocarbon components and solid matter. The
     solid matter can include rock, sand, clay, stone, silt, drilling slurry, or other solid organic
     and/or inorganic matter. The term can also include waste products such as drilling waste
     and by-products, refining waste and by-products, or other waste products containing
     hydrocarbon components, such as asphalt shingling and covering, asphalt pavement, etc.
     CONVEYING SYSTEMS
     [00151]       Various conveying systems can be used to convey the biomass material, for
     example, to a vault and under an electron beam in a vault. Exemplary conveyors are belt
     conveyors, pneumatic conveyors, screw conveyors, carts, trains, trains or carts on rails,

     HYDROGENATION AND OTHER CHEMICAL TRANSFORMATIONS
     [00152]      The processes described herein can include hydrogenation. For example
     glucose and xylose can be hydrogenated to sorbitol and xylitol respectively.
     Hydrogenation can be accomplished by use of a catalyst (e.g., Pt/gamma-A12 0 3 , Ru/C,
     Raney Nickel, or other catalysts know in the art) in combination with H 2 under high
     pressure (e.g., 10 to 12000 psi). Other types of chemical transformation of the products
     from the processes described herein can be used, for example production of organic
     sugar derived products such (e.g., furfural and furfural-derived products). Chemical
     transformations of sugar derived products are described in US Prov. App. No.

     LIGNIN DERIVED PRODUCTS
     [00153]      The spent biomass (e.g., spent lignocellulosic material) from lignocellulosic
     processing by the methods described are expected to have a high lignin content and in
     addition to being useful for producing energy through combustion in a Co-Generation
     plant, may have uses as other valuable products. For example, the lignin can be used as
     captured as a plastic, or it can be synthetically upgraded to other plastics. In some
     instances, it can also be converted to lignosulfonates, which can be utilized as binders,
     dispersants, emulsifiers or as sequestrants.
     [00154]      When used as a binder, the lignin or a lignosulfonate can, e.g., be utilized in
     coal briquettes, in ceramics, for binding carbon black, for binding fertilizers and
     herbicides, as a dust suppressant, in the making of plywood and particle board, for
     binding animal feeds, as a binder for fiberglass, as a binder in linoleum paste and as a
     soil stabilizer.
     [00155]      As a dispersant, the lignin or lignosulfonates can be used, e.g., concrete

WO 2014/138598                                                             PCT/US2014/021813
                                                                  Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C
     [00156]      As an emulsifier, the lignin or lignosulfonates can be used, e.g., in asphalt,
     pigments and dyes, pesticides and wax emulsions.
     [00157]      As a sequestrant, the lignin or lignosulfonates can be used, e.g., in micro
     nutrient systems, cleaning compounds and water treatment systems, e.g., for boiler and
     cooling systems.
     [00158]      For energy production lignin generally has a higher energy content than
     holocellulose (cellulose and hemicellulose) since it contains more carbon than
     holocellulose. For example, dry lignin can have an energy content of between about
     11,000 and 12,500 BTU per pound, compared to 7,000 an 8,000 BTU per pound of
     holocellulose. As such, lignin can be densified and converted into briquettes and pellets
     for burning. For example, the lignin can be converted into pellets by any method
     described herein. For a slower burning pellet or briquette, the lignin can be crosslinked,
     such as applying a radiation dose of between about 0.5 Mrad and 5 Mrad. Crosslinking
     can make a slower burning form factor. The form factor, such as a pellet or briquette,
     can be converted to a "synthetic coal" or charcoal by pyrolyzing in the absence of air,
     e.g., at between 400 and 950 'C. Prior to pyrolyzing, it can be desirable to crosslink the
     lignin to maintain structural integrity.
     [00159]      Co-generation using spent biomass is described in U.S. Provisional
     Application No. 61/774,773, filed March 8, 2013, the entire disclosure therein is herein
     incorporated by reference. The spent biomass may be the lignin byproducts described
     above and/or the fermentation solids from the first and/or the second fermentation.
     OTHER EMBODIMENTS
     [00160]      Any material, processes or processed materials described herein can be used
     to make products and/or intermediates such as composites, fillers, binders, plastic
     additives, adsorbents and controlled release agents. The methods can include
     densification, for example, by applying pressure and heat to the materials. For example
     composites can be made by combining fibrous materials with a resin or polymer. For
     example radiation cross-linkable resin, e.g., a thermoplastic resin can be combined with a
     fibrous material to provide a fibrous material/cross-linkable resin combination. Such
     materials can be, for example, useful as building materials, protective sheets, containers
     and other structural materials (e.g., molded and/or extruded products). Absorbents can
     be, for example, in the form of pellets, chips, fibers and/or sheets. Adsorbents can be
     used, for example, as pet bedding, packaging material or in pollution control systems.
     Controlled release matrices can also be the form of, for example, pellets, chips, fibers
                                                    42

WO 2014/138598                                                                PCT/US2014/021813
                                                                   Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C
     and or sheets. The controlled release matrices can, for example, be used to release drugs,
     biocides, fragrances. For example, composites, absorbents and control release agents
     and their uses are described in U.S. Serial No. PCT/US2006/010648, filed March 23,
     2006, and US Patent No. 8,074,910 filed November 22, 2011, the entire disclosures of
     which are herein incorporated by reference.
     [00161]      In some instances the biomass material is treated at a first level to reduce
     recalcitrance, e.g., utilizing accelerated electrons, to selectively release one or more
     sugars (e.g., xylose). The biomass can then be treated to a second level to release one or
     more other sugars (e.g., glucose). Optionally the biomass can be dried between
     treatments. The treatments can include applying chemical and biochemical treatments to
     release the sugars. For example, a biomass material can be treated to a level of less than
     about 20 Mrad (e.g., less than about 15 Mrad, less than about 10 Mrad, less than about 5
     Mrad, less than about 2 Mrad) and then treated with a solution of sulfuric acid,
     containing less than 10% sulfuric acid (e.g., less than about 9%, less than about 8%, less
     than about 7%, less than about 6%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than
     about 3%, less than about 2%, less than about 1%, less than about 0.75%, less than about
     0.50 %, less than about 0.25%) to release xylose. Xylose, for example that is released
     into solution, can be separated from solids and optionally the solids washed with a
     solvent/solution (e.g., with water and/or acidified water). Optionally, the solids can be
     dried, for example in air and/or under vacuum optionally with heating (e.g., below about
     150 deg C, below about 120 deg C) to a water content below about 25 wt. % (below
     about 20 wt. %, below about 15 wt. %, below about 10 wt. %, below about 5 wt. %). The
     solids can then be treated with a level of less than about 30 Mrad (e.g., less than about 25
     Mrad, less than about 20 Mrad, less than about 15 Mrad, less than about 10 Mrad, less
     than about 5 Mrad, less than about 1 Mrad or even not at all) and then treated with an
     enzyme (e.g., a cellulase) to release glucose. The glucose (e.g., glucose in solution) can
     be separated from the remaining solids. The solids can then be further processed, for
     example utilized to make energy or other products (e.g., lignin derived products).
     [00162]      Other than in the examples herein, or unless otherwise expressly specified, all
     of the numerical ranges, amounts, values and percentages, such as those for amounts of
     materials, elemental contents, times and temperatures of reaction, ratios of amounts, and
     others, in the following portion of the specification and attached claims may be read as if
     prefaced by the word "about" even though the term "about" may not expressly appear
     with the value, amount, or range. Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the

     numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are
     approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be
     obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the
     application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical
     parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant
     digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.
     FLAVORS, FRAGRANCES AND COLORANTS
     [00163]      Any of the products and/or intermediates described herein, for example,
     produced by the processes, systems and/or equipment described herein, can be combined
     with flavors, fragrances, colorants and/or mixtures of these. For example, any one or
     more of (optionally along with flavors, fragrances and/or colorants) sugars, organic
     acids, fuels, polyols, such as sugar alcohols, biomass, fibers and composites can be
     combined with (e.g., formulated, mixed or reacted) or used to make other products. For
     example, one or more such product can be used to make soaps, detergents, candies,
     drinks (e.g., cola, wine, beer, liquors such as gin or vodka, sports drinks, coffees, teas),
     pharmaceuticals, adhesives, sheets (e.g., woven, none woven, filters, tissues) and/or
     composites (e.g., boards). For example, one or more such product can be combined with
     herbs, flowers, petals, spices, vitamins, potpourri, or candles. For example, the
     formulated, mixed or reacted combinations can have flavors/fragrances of grapefruit,
     orange, apple, raspberry, banana, lettuce, celery, cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla,
     peppermint, mint, onion, garlic, pepper, saffron, ginger, milk, wine, beer, tea, lean beef,
     fish, clams, olive oil, coconut fat, pork fat, butter fat, beef bouillon, legume, potatoes,
     marmalade, ham, coffee and cheeses.
     [00164]      Flavors, fragrances and colorants can be added in any amount, such as
     between about 0.001 wt.% to about 30 wt.%, e.g., between about 0.01 to about 20,
     between about 0.05 to about 10, or between about 0.1 wt.% to about 5 wt.%. These can
     be formulated, mixed and or reacted (e.g., with any one of more product or intermediate
     described herein) by any means and in any order or sequence (e.g., agitated, mixed,
     emulsified, gelled, infused, heated, sonicated, and/or suspended). Fillers, binders,
     emulsifier, antioxidants can also be utilized, for example protein gels, starches and silica.
     [00165]       In one embodiment the flavors, fragrances and colorants can be added to the
     biomass immediately after the biomass is irradiated such that the reactive sites created by
                                                    44

WO 2014/138598                                                             PCT/US2014/021813
                                                                  Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C
     the irradiation may react with reactive compatible sites of the flavors, fragrances, and
     colorants.
     [00166]      The flavors, fragrances and colorants can be natural and/or synthetic
     materials. These materials can be one or more of a compound, a composition or mixtures
     of these (e.g., a formulated or natural composition of several compounds). Optionally the
     flavors, fragrances, antioxidants and colorants can be derived biologically, for example,
     from a fermentation process (e.g., fermentation of saccharified materials as described
     herein). Alternatively, or additionally these flavors, fragrances and colorants can be
     harvested from a whole organism (e.g., plant, fungus, animal, bacteria or yeast) or a part
     of an organism. The organism can be collected and or extracted to provide color, flavors,
     fragrances and/or antioxidant by any means including utilizing the methods, systems and
     equipment described herein, hot water extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, chemical
     extraction (e.g., solvent or reactive extraction including acids and bases), mechanical
     extraction (e.g., pressing, comminuting, filtering), utilizing an enzyme, utilizing a
     bacteria such as to break down a starting material, and combinations of these methods.
     The compounds can be derived by a chemical reaction, for example, the combination of
     a sugar (e.g., as produced as described herein) with an amino acid (Maillard reaction).
     The flavor, fragrance, antioxidant and/or colorant can be an intermediate and or product
     produced by the methods, equipment or systems described herein, for example and ester
     and a lignin derived product.
     [00167]      Some examples of flavor, fragrances or colorants are polyphenols.
     Polyphenols are pigments responsible for the red, purple and blue colorants of many
     fruits, vegetables, cereal grains, and flowers. Polyphenols also can have antioxidant
     properties and often have a bitter taste. The antioxidant properties make these important
     preservatives. On class of polyphenols are the flavonoids, such as Anthocyanidines,
     flavanonols, flavan-3-ols, s, flavanones and flavanonols.     Other phenolic compounds
     that can be used include phenolic acids and their esters, such as chlorogenic acid and
     polymeric tannins.
     [00168]      Among the colorants inorganic compounds, minerals or organic compounds
     can be used, for example titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, aluminum oxide, cadmium yellow
     (E.g., CdS), cadmium orange (e.g., CdS with some Se), alizarin crimson (e.g., synthetic
     or non-synthetic rose madder), ultramarine (e.g., synthetic ultramarine, natural
     ultramarine, synthetic ultramarine violet ), cobalt blue, cobalt yellow, cobalt green,
     viridian (e.g., hydrated chromium(III)oxide), chalcophylite, conichalcite, cornubite,

     [00171]     Concentrations were determined by HPLC in aqueous diluted and filtered
     solutions with appropriate standards. Unless otherwise noted the reactants were obtained
     from Sigma/Aldrich, St. Louis MO, Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA or equivalent
     reactant supply house.
     Saccharification
     [00172]     A cylindrical tank with a diameter of 32 Inches, 64 Inches in height and fit
     with ASME dished heads (top and bottom) was used in the saccharification. The tank
     was also equipped with a hydrofoil mixing blade 16" wide. Heating was provided by
     flowing hot water through a half pipe jacket surrounding the tank.
     [00173]     The tank was charged with 200 kg water, 80 kg of biomass, and 18 kg of
     Duetm Cellulase enzyme available from Genencor, Palo Alto, CA. Biomass was corn
     cob that had been hammer milled and screened to a size of between 10 and 40 mesh. The
     biomass was irradiated with an electron beam to a total dosage of 35 Mrad. The pH of
     the mixture was adjusted and maintained automatically throughout the saccharification at
     4.8 using Ca(OH) 2. This combination was heated to 53 0C, stirred at 180 rpm for about
     24 hours after which the saccharification was considered completed.
     [00174]     A portion of this material was screened through a 20 mesh screen and the
     solution stored in an 8 gal carboy at 4 0 C.
     Fermentation of Glucose to Ethanol
     [00175]     About 400mL of the saccharified material was decanted into a IL New
     Brunswick BioFlow 115 Bioreactor. The material was aerated and heated to 30 0 C prior
     to inoculation. Stirring was set at 50 rpm. The pH was measured at 5.2, which is
     acceptable for fermentation so it was not adjusted. Aeration was discontinued and the
     contents of the bioreactor were inoculated with 5 mg of Thermosacc Dry Yeast
                                                  51

WO 2014/138598                                                               PCT/US2014/021813
                                                                    Attorney Code No: 00169-1WO-C
     (Lallemand, Inc., Memphis TN) (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Fermentation was allowed
     to proceed for about 24 hours.
     [00176]      After fermentation the glucose concentration was below the detection limit,
     the ethanol concentration was about 25 g/L, and the xylose concentration was about
     30g/L.
     Preparation of Distillate Bottoms
     [00177]      Distillate bottoms were prepared by distilling the ethanol from fermented
     material as described above. In addition, solids were removed by centrifugation. The
     final amount of dissolved solids was 5 to 10 wt. There also were fines in the suspended
     solid. After the distillation the xylose concentration was about 40 g/L. These bottoms
     were designated as Distillate Bottoms Lot A. A similarly prepared batch was designated
     as Lot R.
     Fermentation of Xylose to Butyric Acid:
              Distillate Bottoms Experiment (A)
     [00178]       Seven IL New Brunswick BioFlow 115 Bioreactor were utilized in the
     experiment. All seven reactors were initially filled with 200 mL of 3x concentrate of P2
     media (described below) and of 72 g Xylose (Danisco, Copenhagen, DE). Two of the
     reactors (BR2 and BR4) were charged with 120 mL of distillate bottom prepared as
     described above (Lot A). Two reactors (BR6 and BR8) were charged with 240 mL of
     distillate bottom (Lot A). Two (BR18 and BR20) were charged with 360mL of distillate
     bottom (Lot A). One reactor (BR22) was charged with 240 mL of distillate bottom (Lot
     R). All the bioreactors were brought to total volume of 600mL with DI water. For
     example, BR2 had 200 mL of P2 media, 120 mL of Distillate Bottoms Lot A, -72 grams
     of xylose and DI water to make up to 600 mL. The Xylose concentration was 72 grams
     plus ~ 4.8 g from the Distillate Bottoms for a concentration of about 128 g/L. The
     reactors were sparged with N 2 gas and inoculated with 7% (45mL of C. tyrobutyricum
     (ATCC 25755). The seed was grown overnight at 37        0   C in 300mL of reinforced
     clostridia media from 1 mL freezer stocks. The bioreactors were sampled periodically
     submitted for GC and HPLC analysis. The fermentations were maintained above 6.0
     using 3.7N ammonium hydroxide. Table 1 shows data collected for these experiments.
     [00179]      P2 based medium was made as described in US 6,358,717 but as a 3 fold
     concentrate (3X), that is only 1/3 of the water was used to make the solutions. P2
     medium is made as follows. The medium is composed of the following separately
     prepared solutions (in grams per 100 ml of distilled water, unless indicated otherwise):
     790 ml of distilled water (solution I), 0.5 g of K 2 HPO 4 , 0.5 g of KH 2PO 4 , 2.2 g of

     thiamine, 1 mg of biotin (solution IV). Solutions I and II were filter sterilized and
     subsequently mixed to form a buffer solution. Solutions III and IV were filter sterilized.
     Portions (10 and 1 ml) of solutions III and IV, respectively, were added aseptically to the
     buffer solution. The final pH of the P2 medium was 6.6.

     Isolation of Butyrate Using an Acidic Resin
     [00183]      AmberliteTM IRA 400 resin (500 g) was washed with water (2 x 500 mL) in a
     5 L round bottom flask. Excess water was removed carefully with a pipette before
     adding a fermentation broth to the wet resin. Fermentation broth (2 L) containing
     44.7g/L butyric acid was added and the resulting mixture was stirred using a magnetic
     stirrer for 1.5 h. A small analytical sample was removed and was found to contain 32.5
     g/L butyric acid (27 % loss) by GC head space analysis. This indicated that 24.5 g of
     butyric acid was adsorbed onto the resin.
     [00184]      The supernatant solution was poured off and the wet resin was loaded onto a
     glass column with a wire sieve at the bottom to prevent clogging. Fermentation broth
     was rinsed off the resin with a flow of water (2 L) until the eluent was clear. The resin
     was then transferred to a 2 L round bottom flask containing a magnetic stirring bar and
     then treated with 100 mL of 1 N HCl followed by 8 mL of 6 N HCl. The resulting
     mixture was stirred for 5 minutes and the pH was found to be 2.5, which was then
     subjected to distillation. A total of five bulb to bulb distillations gave 150-250 mL
     fractions. In between distillations more water and 1 N HCl was added to the resin.
     Fractions were made basic with 20 % aqueous NaOH and concentrated by rotary
     evaporation. Drying in vacuo at 120     0 C overnight gave 16.23 g as a combined crude
     solid or 14.13 g of sodium butyrate in the sample. This amounts to a 57.7 % recovery for
     the five distillations. Additional distillations would lead to a higher recovery.
     Isolation of Butyrate using a Basic Resin
     [00185]      To 400 mL of butyric acid fermentation broth (44.58 g/L) in a 1 L round

     The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours and then allowed to
     stand for 10 minutes. A small analytical sample (1/2 mL) was removed and placed in a

     vial.  This was found to have 24.29 g/L butyric acid (54.49 % reduction) by GC head
     space analysis. This indicated that 9.72 g was adsorbed onto the resin.
     [00186]      The supernatant solution was poured off and the remaining broth was
     removed with a 50 mL pipette. The resin was rinsed with water (8 x 25 mL) and then
     treated with a 10 % solution of H 2 SO 4 in EtOH (50 mL). The resulting mixture was
     stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes and then the ethanolic solution was removed
     by pipette. The resin was then rinsed with EtOH (10 x 25 mL), followed by water (10 x
     25 mL). The EtOH rinse solutions were combined and basified with 20 % NaOH (pH
     11) and then concentrated by rotary evaporation. The water rinse solutions were treated
     similarly and both solids were dried further in vacuo at 120   0 C to give 6.74 g (72.57 %
     sodium butyrate by LC analysis) from ethanol and 1.90 g (80.44 % sodium butyrate by
     LC analysis) from water. The total recovery from the resin was 66.1 %.
     Conversion of Butyrate to Ethyl Butyrate
     [00187]      A crude mixture of solids containing a total of 8.9 g of sodium butyrate was
     treated with 50 mL of ethanol in a 250 mL round bottom flask and the resulting mixture
     was cooled in a water bath and slowly treated with concentrated sulfuric acid (16 g)
     while stirring with a magnetic stirring bar. The round bottom flask was fitted with a
     reflux condenser and the reaction mixture was boiled for 4 hours under N 2. After
     cooling to room temperature the reaction mixture was poured into a separatory funnel
     containing a 150 mL aqueous solution of Na 2HPO 4 (40 g). The final pH of the solution
     after mixing was 7. The top layer was separated out and filtered through glass wool to
     remove sludge giving 4.5 mL of ethyl butyrate. This sample was combined with other
     similar samples to give about 29 g of a crude liquid that was distilled to give 23.6 g (88
     % purity by LC analysis) ethyl butyrate. The impurities were mostly ethanol (9.2 %) and

     Processing of Sodium Lactate solution
     [00195]      Both the D-lactic acid and L-lactic acid derived sodium lactate were
     decolorized as described here. Fermentations were run repeatedly to provide larger
     quantities of material and facilitate the decolorization.
     [00196]      Thirty liters of fermentation medium containing sodium lactate prepared by
     fermentation as described above were centrifuged at 4200 rpm for 60 minutes. The
     supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 micron cartridge filter producing 26.5 L of
     filtrate. Nineteen liters of the filtrate were percolated through a column containing 2.7 L
     of a highly porous styrenic polymeric bead type resin, Mitsubishi Diaion SP-700, at a
     flow rate of 1.5 BV/h. The first 1.5 L of eluate are discarded and the rest of the medium
     and an additional 1.5 L of water are eluted and pooled. The remaining portion of the
     medium was decolorized in a similar manner resulting in 7.5 L of pale colored solution.
     The two batches of decolorized material were pooled and stored in the cold if not used
     immediately.
     Desalination Electro Dialysis of decolorized Lactate solution
     [00197]      The decolorized medium prepared as described above was subjected to
     electro dialysis using a desalination membrane.
     [00198]      The a reservoir of the Electrodialysis apparatus was charged with the
     decolorized sodium lactate medium and the Concentrate reservoir of the apparatus was
     charged with 4 L of deionized water. Electrodialysis was continued for 5 hours using a
     voltage of 40 V and a maximum current of 5 A.
     [00199]      This procedure produced a concentrated lactate stream with a typical
     concentration of around 66 g/L (starting at 38 g/L) and a concentrated xylose stream with
     a typical conductivity of 5 pS/cm (starting 34 pS/cm).
     Bipolar Electrodialysis
     [00200]      The liquid in the stream in sodium lactate produced as described above can be
     subjected to a second electro dialysis using a bipolar membrane to produce a lactic acid
     solution and a sodium hydroxide solution. The procedure that can be followed is
     described here.
     [00201]      Sodium lactate (1.6 L) solution prepared by desalination electrodialysis is
     added to the Diluate reservoir. Deionized water (1 L) is added to each reservoir for the
     lactic acid and sodium hydroxide streams. The electrodialysis is carried out using a 4
     chamber electro dialysis cell fitted with a bipolar membrane stack. The voltage is set to
     23 V and the maximum current is set to 6.7 A. The dialysis can be carried out for 5
     hours or until the conductivity of the dilute stream is < 5 % of its starting value.
