                                  STYLET CONSTRUCTION
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   Various aspects of the invention relate to catheter systems, to stylets therefor and to
   methods of forming such stylets.
 5 BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
   The initial applicant has previously developed a catheter system that entails a stylet
   including a connector and an elongate portion. The connector connects to an ex vivo
   end of the catheter whilst the elongate portion runs along the interior of the catheter
   to project beyond the in vivo end of the catheter. According to preferred variants of
10 the system, the stylets reduce the risk of occlusion of the catheter due to kinking
   and/or due to the in vivo end of the catheter pressing against body tissue. Such
   systems are described in the initial applicant's earlier international patent application
   published as W02014/190373 Al. The contents of that publication are incorporated
   herein by reference.
15 It is desirable to produce such stylets cost efficiently and in a manner more likely to
   be accepted by regulatory authorities and medical practitioners.
   With the foregoing in mind, the present invention aims to provide improvements in
   and for stylets and catheter systems including such stylets, or at least to provide an
   alternative for those concerned with catheter systems.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   Figure 5 illustrates a portion of a stylet 1 including a connector 3 and an elongate
   member 5.
   In this example the connector 3 is a luer connector. By using a connector, such as a
 5 luer connector, familiar to medical practitioners, the stylet is more likely to be
   accepted by regulatory authorities and by medical practitioners. The connector
   includes a forwardly projecting male luer portion 7b and a port in the form of a
   rearwardly open female luer portion 7a. An internally threaded collar 9 surrounds the
   male luer portion 7b. The male luer portion 7b and the collar 9 cooperate with a
10 catheter (not shown) to connect the connector 3 to the rear (ex vivo) end of the
   catheter. The connector 3 is preferably formed of polymeric material.
   An inner passageway 11 including the female luer portion 7a and the interior of the
   male luer portion 7b runs through the connector 3 to communicate the interior of the
   catheter with the outside world. Figure 5 shows a male luer fitting 13 cooperating with
15 the female luer portion 7a to fluidly connect the connector 3, and in turn the catheter,
   to the outside world e.g. to a fluid source (such as a saline drip), to a fluid destination
   (such as an evacuated vial for receiving a blood sample) or a sensor such as a blood
   pressure transducer.
   The elongate member 5 may be a single integrally formed member. In other
20 embodiments, the elongate member is formed of at least two parts. For the
   avoidance of doubt 'integrally formed' and similar terms are used in their conventional
   sense in this context to refer to a component formed of a single continuous phase of
   material. Two components may be integrated through processes such as welding but
   not through typical mechanical fastening techniques.
25 The elongate member 5 includes elongate body 15 and an anchor body 17.
   The elongate body 15 is, in this example, a polymeric monofilament known to
   medical professionals as RadeneTM. Of course other filaments are possible. The
   filament 15 has a diameter of about 0.3mm. A diameter of about this value

    P1459AUAU
                                                   7
   (corresponding to a cross-sectional area of not more than 0.1mm 2 ) has been found to
   be advantageous for the various applications described in the initial applicant's earlier
   international patent application.
   The filament 15 is connected to the anchor body 17 with the aid of a knot 19, formed
 5 in the filament 15, and/or adhesive such as epoxy adhesive or cyanoacrylate. The
   anchor body 17 takes the form of a square-profiled ring. Between an interior and an
   exterior of the ring, a stepped bore 21 passes through the material of the ring. The
   forward end of the bore 21 is dimensioned to enable the filament 15 but not the knot
   19 to pass therethrough. In this case the forward portion of a bore 21 has a diameter
10 of 0.35mm. The rearward end of the bore 21 is dimensioned to receive the knot 19. In
   this case it has a diameter of 0.55mm. This provides a positive engagement between
   the knot 19 and the forward portion of the bore 21 so that the filament 15 cannot be
   left behind when the connector 3 is removed from a catheter. The adhesive sits within
   the rearward end of the bore 21 and bonds to the anchor and to the filament to
15 prevent the filament reversing out of the anchor.
   In another variant (not shown), the anchor body 17 has two bores 21. The filament 15
   goes through one of the bores then back through the other bore whereat it is secured
   with a knot.
   To assemble the stylet 1, the filament is inserted into the female luer portion 7a so
20 that it passes through the passageway 11 to forwardly project from the connector 3.
   The following anchor body 17 is pressed into the female luer portion 7a and is
   dimensioned to form an interference fit between the cylindrical exterior of the anchor
   body 17 and the forwardly-converging conical interior of the female luer portion 7a.
   This interference fit fixes the anchor body 17 to the connector 3. The connector is
25 preferably built to ISO594/1. The anchor body 17 is configured so that when pressed
   into position it sits within a portion of the female luer portion 7a forward of the
   maximum engagement of the male luer portion 13 (as dictated by the ISO standard)
   so as not to interfere with that male luer portion. Similar positioning is possible with
   components that do not necessarily comply with the ISO standard.

                                                 8
   The anchor body 17 is rearward of a narrow point 23 of the passage 11. The inner
   diameter of the anchor body 17 is no smaller than the inner diameter of the narrow
   point 23 such that the anchor body 17 presents negligible impedance to flow through
   the connector 3.
 5 The anchor body 17 may be formed of polymeric material such as polycarbonate
   although other materials are possible.
   Figure 2 shows an alternate anchor body 17'. Instead of having a simple cylindrical
   interior, the anchor 17' includes an inward projection in which the bore 21' is located.
   This may enable the inner diameter of the anchor 17' to be enlarged.
10 Figure 3 illustrates an alternate anchor 17" for which the knot 19 is not required.
   Instead of the knot 19, the filament is bent through 1800 over a wraparound portion
   24 of the anchor 17" so that a forwardly projecting end portion 15a of the filament 15'
   is located within a gripping portion 25 of the anchor member 17". The gripping portion
   25 includes a groove in which the portion 15a of the filament 15' is seated and a
15 click-in arrangement 27 including a cooperable pair of hooks. The portion 25 is
   deformable to click into place so that the hooks of the portion 27 engage to retain the
   portion 25 in a position in which it grips the end 15a. Other click-in arrangements are
   possible.
   Figure 4 shows an alternate anchor 17"' without any click-in mechanism. Instead, the
20 gripping portion 25 is arranged to deform to grip the filament 15 when the anchor
   portion 17"' is pressed into the connector 3.
   Figure 6 illustrates an alternate click-in arrangement 27' including a finger 29
   including a forwardly facing groove 31 and being inwardly moveable to click over, and
   bring the groove 31 into engagement with, a rearwardly projecting ridge 33.
25 Figures 7 to 9 illustrate another stylet 1' incorporating a connector 3 and an elongate
   member 5'. The member 5' includes a filament 15 akin to that previously described
   and an anchor member 17a. The anchor member 17a is crimped to the end of the
   filament 15.

    P1459AUAU
                                                 9
   Referring to Figure 10, to produce the stylet 1', at step 100 a suitable length of
   filament is drawn from roll stock and cut to length. At step 102 an end 15a of the
   filament 15 is bent to 1800.
   As best shown in Figure 11, the anchor portion 17a is formed from a crimp blanks
 5 17a' which is carried with other similar blanks on an elongate carrier strip 35. The
   carrier strip 35, and blanks carried thereby, preferably together take the form of roll
   stock.
   At 102, the forward most blank 17a' is positioned within a lower crimping dye 37.
   As best shown in Figures 12 and 13, the blank 17a' is approximately V-shaped. At
10 step 104 the filament 15 and the turned back return portion 15a thereof are
   positioned within the arms of the V-shaped blank 17a'. At steps 106a and 106b the
   upper crimping dye 39 is lowered towards the lower crimping dye 37 to deform the
   arms of the blank 17a' so that the ends of those arms inwardly deform to embrace
   and grip both portions of the filament 15. This double-gripping provides an extra
15 degree of assurity that the filament 15 will not be left behind when the connector 3 is
   withdrawn from the catheter.
   At step 108 the crimping dyes 37, 39 are separated to facilitate removal of the
   member 15, 17a. A waste portion 35a of the carrier strip 35 is sheared away. The
   carrier strip 35 can then be advanced and operations 102 to 108 repeated to produce
20 further members 15, 17a.
   Each member 15, 17a is then trimmed at step 110. The anchor 17a can be used as a
   reference point to locate the member whereby the finished length of the projecting
   portion of the filament 15 may be more accurately controlled. At step 112, a
   protective sheath 41 for protecting the filament 15 is fitted to the connector 3. In this
25 example the sheath 41 is a silicone protective sheath engaged with the exterior of the
   male luer portion 7b. At step 114 the filament 15 is inserted into the rear of the
   connector 3 to pass through the connector 3 and slide into the sheath 41. The anchor
   17a is pressed into its final position by a rearward tool portion 43 having a suitable

    P1459AUAU
                                                10
   tubular end portion to bear against the anchor 17a' without damaging the loop of
   filament 15.
   The connector sits against a connector engaging anvil towards which the tool portion
   43 presses. Of course it matters not which of the tool portion 43 and the connector
 5 engaging portion is moved. The tool portion 43 could be the anvil which serves to
   press the anchor 17a into the connector 3 when the connector-engaging portion is
   driven towards the tool portion 43.
   This pressing operation creates an interference fit between the anchor 17a and the
   inner passage 11 of the connector 3 by which the anchor 17a is fixed within that inner
10 passage.
   The stylet is then subject to a Quality Assurance check and bagged at step 116. The
   bagged stylet is then sterilised (at step 118) to produce a transportable product that
   remains sterile and ready for use.
   Figure 9 is an end view of the stylet 1' illustrating that the anchor 17a has an inner
15 diameter 45 that is larger than the diameter of the narrow point 23. As such, the
   cross-sectional area available for flow passed the anchor 17a is about double the
   cross-sectional area of the narrow point 23 whereby the anchor 17a presents
   negligible resistance to flow.
   In the examples described thus far, anchors having cylindrical exteriors have been
20 pressed into the conical interiors of connectors to form interference fits. Other forms
   of engagement are possible. By way of example, an anchor having a suitable
   arrangement of barbs might cooperate with a cylindrical interior of a connector.
   Equally, the interior of the connector may be fitted with the barbs.
   The anchor 17a is preferably metallic, although other suitably malleable materials
25 may be used. The described process is particularly suited to high volume/low cost
   manufacture.

    P1459AUAU
                                                11
   Preferred forms of the described stylet find a place in a catheter system including a) a
   peripheral vascular catheter cooperable with the stylet and b) a needle cooperable
   with the catheter for catheter-over-needle insertion.
   Catheter-over-needle insertion is advantageous in that a better 'seal' between the
 5 exterior of the catheter and the flesh of the patient is created relative to the seal
   created when a catheter is inserted using a conventional catheter-through-needle
   insertion technique.
   Catheters for catheter-over-needle insertion typically have relatively thin walls and
   are therefore at risk of kinking. The inventor has also recognised that the open end of
10 such catheters can be occluded, e.g. when pressed against the interior of a blood
   vessel.
   The stylet 1' is configured for insertion into the catheter after the needle has been
   removed. The filament 15 is dimensioned to project beyond the open in vivo end of
   the catheter when the connector 3 is engaged with the catheter.
15 The projecting free end of the stylet has been found to prevent the catheter tip being
   occluded by a blood vessel wall. Polymeric monofilaments (such as radene) having a
   diameter of not more than 0.4mm (corresponding to a cross-sectional area of not
   more than 0.13mm 2 ) are preferred. In stark contrast to metallic guide wires that might
   be used in some other applications, such filaments have been found to be sufficiently
20 soft so that the protruding end portion of the filament does not damage the blood
   vessel and to have a desirable degree of compliance. Such filaments are stiff enough
   to enable the stylet to be easily placed yet compliant to allow the catheter to bend as
   necessary. Whilst the catheter is allowed to bend as necessary, the stylet adds some
   stiffness and resistance to kinking. Furthermore, the inventor's earlier experiments
25 have shown that the presence of such stylets prevent the catheter being fully
   occluded if and when kinking occurs.
   Whilst polymeric monofilaments are preferred, other suitably soft and compliant
   materials could be used.
