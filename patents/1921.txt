                                        ABSTRACT
A coaxial ventilator exchanges atmosphere between parts of a building that are at
differing heights. The coaxial ventilator includes an outer conduit that extends from an
upper end thereof downward to a lower end thereof. An inner conduit extends
substantially the entire length of the outer conduit. Both the outer and inner conduits
are open at their respective upper ends and lower ends. Temperatures of atmosphere
both surrounding and within the outer conduit and the inner conduit induce an exchange
of atmosphere between the coaxial ventilator and surrounding atmosphere.

                                           Background
Technical Field
[0002]         The present disclosure relates generally to building ventilation and, more
particularly, to a ventilation system that exploits a temperature difference between a
building's interior and the surrounding atmosphere.
Background Art
[0003A]        Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like
in this specification is included solely for the purpose of providing a context for the
present invention. It is not suggested or represented that any of these matters formed
part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the
present invention as it existed in Australia or elsewhere before the priority date of each
claim of this application.
[0003]          Using gravity for moving heating, circulating and ventilating air is a simple
technique that has been a well understood and practiced for more than 100 years. Hot
air is less dense than cold air and will therefore tend to rise while cooler air tends to
settle. However, the force produced in this way is very slight, and is easily overcome by
friction in ducts and by wind pressure around a building. A gravity ventilation system is
simpler than a forced air system, requires no skilled attention, and is less expensive to
install. Widespread use of gravity heating air and water systems ended mainly because
such systems:
         1.    were difficult to install requiring large ducts and many penetrations through
floor slabs etc.; and
         2.    their installation required experienced engineers who could assess a
building's suitability for a gravity heating systems.

                                                2
[0004]         Historically, the advantages of gravity heating and circulation made it
particularly advantageous for houses, small school buildings, churches, halls, etc.,
where a heat source may be placed near the bases of a warm air duct and where air
flow resistance is low. However, unseparated air ducts in a gravity ventilation system
often become inefficient due to stagnation if the duct's wall becomes exposed to cooler
surrounding or adjacent air that induces downdrafts within the duct which collide with
rising warmer air. Gravity air ducts that allow air to circulate simultaneously in opposite
directions require very large cross-sections like an air well in multistory buildings. Also,
it has been thought that using gravity for ventilation is more expensive than a fan
because the amount of thermal energy required to produce a significant draft or air
velocity through a duct greatly exceeds the electrical energy required to power a fan.
Gravity air circulation may exhibit difficulty in moving hot air into certain rooms in a
building during windy weather.

                                        Brief Summary
[0006]         The present disclosure provides an improved ventilation duct.
[0007]         Another potential advantage of the present disclosure is that in one
alternative embodiment it allows drawing via a drain tap collected rainwater as a backup
for supplementary or emergency domestic water supply.
[0008]         Another potential advantage of the present disclosure is that where in one
alternative embodiment where the water pan is filled from the Municipal Water Mains
thru a Float Valve (not illustrated in any of the FIGs.), the present disclosure essentially
combines the functions of a domestic water reservoir tank and a building cooler into one
compact cost efficient device.

                                                 8
                                      Detailed Description
[0039]          FIGs. 1 and 2 depict a coaxial ventilator, identified by the general
reference number 20, included in the structure of a building 22. The coaxial ventilator
20 includes an uninsulated outer conduit 24 made of a thermally conductive material
that is juxtaposed with and, in the illustrations of FIGs. 1 and 2, passes through:
        1.      a roof 32;
        2.      a ceiling 34 of a warm upper story room 36; and
        3.      a floor 38 of the room 36.
[0040]          The roof 32, the ceiling 34 and the floor 38 are all respective portions of
the building 22. As depicted in FIGs. 1 and 2, the outer conduit 24 of the coaxial
ventilator 20 has a length that extends from a flared upper end 42 located above the
roof 32 downward to a lower end 44 that is located at a lower room 46 of the building 22
beneath the room 36. In the illustrations of FIGs. 1 and 2 the building 22 also includes:
         1.     an upper interior wall 52a;
        2.      a lower interior wall 52b;
        3.      a floor 54 for the room 46 for which the floor 38 of the upper room 36 also
        provides a ceiling;
        4.      an upper exterior wall 56a; and
        5.      a lower exterior wall 56b.
[0041]          The coaxial ventilator 20 also includes an inner conduit 62 made of a
thermally insulative material which may be flexible and/or corrugated that is:
         1.     surrounded by the outer conduit 24;
        2.      extends substantially along the entire length of the outer conduit 24; and
        3.      is pierced by a plurality of holes 63 at locations 64a, 64b and 64c where
        transitions occur in temperature about the outer conduit 24.
[0042]          An upper end 66 of the inner conduit 62 is preferably located slightly below
the top of the flared upper end 42 of the outer conduit 24. Preferably, a lower end 68 of
the inner conduit 62 is similarly recessed slightly above the lower end 44 of the outer
conduit 24. Consequently, the inner conduit 62 has a slightly shorter length than that of
the outer conduit 24.

                                                 9
[0043]         As depicted most clearly in FIG. 3, the presence of the inner conduit 62
centered within the outer conduit 24 establishes an annularly shaped space 72
therebetween that extends along the length of the inner conduit 62. Cross-sectional
areas of the inner conduit 62 and the annularly shaped space 72 should be
approximately equal with the cross-sectional area of the annularly shaped space 72
being slightly larger to compensate for air friction with both the outer conduit 24 and the
inner conduit 62.
[0044]         While FIG. 3 depicts the inner conduit 62 as being centered within the
outer conduit 24, that is not an essential requirement for the coaxial ventilator 20. The
coaxial ventilator 20 works well if the inner conduit 62 were to be displaced to one side
within the outer conduit 24. The inner conduit 62 may not be centered within the outer
conduit 24 if, for example, the inner conduit 62 were loosely fixed or not secured at the
very center of the outer conduit 24 perhaps to facilitate fabricating the coaxial ventilator
20 or adjustment of inner conduit 62 etc., or if at some locations within the building 22
the coaxial ventilator 20 is inclined, i.e. not vertical.
[0045]         If the inner conduit 62 is insecurely positioned within the outer conduit 24
and the coaxial ventilator 20 is inclined, the inner conduit 62 may sag or hang against a
lower wall of the outer conduit 24. Under such a circumstance, inner conduit 62 may
contact the outer conduit 24 but because the inner conduit 62 is thermally insulated, i.e.
does not conduct heat well, and contact area is small, little heat will be transferred from
the outer conduit 24 to the inner conduit 62 thereby preserving a temperature difference
between the outer and inner conduits 24, 62. Accordingly, the coaxial ventilator 20
works regardless of whether the inner conduit 62 is at the exact center of the outer
conduit 24 or displaced to one side thereof.
[0046]         In fact, displacing the inner conduit 62 greatly to one side of the outer
conduit 24 lowers airflow resistance between the outer and inner conduits 24, 62.
Displacing the inner conduit 62 to one side of the outer conduit 24 forces most of the
airflow between the outer and inner conduits 24, 62 into a more cohesive "fat" crescent
cross-sectional shape, with the major portion of the air flow occurring in the "fat" center
of the crescent. If most of the air flow occurs in the "fat" center of the crescent, the air
flow more nearly approximates that of an ideal circular cross sectional shape.
Approaching more nearly to an ideal circular cross sectional air flow minimizes friction
with the outer and inner conduits 24, 62 in comparison with the thinner, strictly perfectly

                                              10
annular shape of airflow along the annularly shaped space 72 having the same cross
sectional area. To reduce friction due to stagnant "dead" space at the sharp "horned"
ends of a crescent cross-sectional shape near where the inner conduit 62 contacts the
outer conduit 24, the cross-sectional area between the outer and inner conduits 24, 62
can be increased to be slightly larger than the cross-sectional area of the inner conduit
62.
[0047]        As depicted in FIG. 1, the coaxial ventilator 20 may also include a cover
82 disposed above the flared upper end 42 of the outer conduit 24. Among other
functions described in greater detail below, the cover 82 occludes upper ends 42, 66
both of the outer conduit 24 and of the inner conduit 62 thereby preventing precipitation
from entering thereinto.
[0048]        The outer conduit 24 of the coaxial ventilator 20 is highly heat absorbent
and heat radiative such as being fabricated with a matt black absorptive and radiative
surface. The inner conduit 62 is preferably made of heat insulating material. A length
of the coaxial ventilator 20 passing through a warmer area of the building 22, such as
the room 36 in FIG. 1, is warmed thereby heating air within a segment of the annularly
shaped space 72 that spans the room 36. As depicted in FIG. 1 by small upwardly
directed arrows in the annularly shaped space 72 below the location 64b, warmer air
within the annularly shaped space 72 spanning the room 36 rises while cooler air within
a segment of the inner conduit 62 spanning the room 36 descends. Above a zone in
which a transition in temperature about the outer conduit 24 occurs, such as that during
nighttime surrounding the location 64a in FIG. 1, lower temperature atmosphere about
the outer conduit 24 cools air within the annularly shaped space 72 above the roof 32.
In a length of the coaxial ventilator 20 being cooled by the surrounded atmosphere, as
depicted in FIG. 1 by small downardly directed arrows within the annularly shaped
space 72 above the location 64b, cooler air descends while warmer air in the inner
conduit 62 above the location 64a rises.
[0049]        At a location along the length of the coaxial ventilator 20 where rising
warmer air within the annularly shaped space 72 meets descending cooler air within the
annularly shaped space 72 such as at the location 64b, an exchange of air occurs
between the annularly shaped space 72 and the inner conduit 62 with:
        1.    cooler descending air flowing through the holes 63 piercing the inner
conduit 62 at the location 64b into the inner conduit 62; and

                                                  11
        2.      warmer rising air flowing through the holes 63 piercing the inner conduit 62
at the location 64b into the inner conduit 62.
[0050]          After flowing from the annularly shaped space 72 into the inner conduit 62,
the descending cooler air continues descending within the inner conduit 62 below the
location 64b while the rising warmer air continues rising within the inner conduit 62
above the location 64b. As depicted in FIG. 1, in this way warmer air first rises from the
room 46 in the building 22 initially via the annularly shaped space 72 and subsequently
via the inner conduit 62 to exit the coaxial ventilator 20 at the top thereof. Conversely,
cooler air initially enters the annularly shaped space 72 at the flared upper end 42 of the
outer conduit 24 to flow downward before entering the room 46 via the inner conduit 62.
[0051]          The locations 64a, 64b and 64c where holes 63 pierce the inner conduit
62 promote formation of transition zones inside the coaxial ventilator 20 where air
flowing in the annularly shaped space 72 may enter into the inner conduit 62 and
conversely. There exists a tendency for exchanges of air to occur between the
annularly shaped space 72 and the inner conduit 62 where the coaxial ventilator 20
passes through the exterior of the building 22 such as at the roof 32. A tendency exists
for flow exchanges of air wherever a change in temperature occurs along the length of
the coaxial ventilator 20, i.e. where the coaxial ventilator 20 passes from one thermal
environment to another thermal environment.
[0052]          The cover 82 of the coaxial ventilator 20 may be advantageously
configured for evaporatively cooling air entering the flared upper end 42 of the outer
conduit 24 by including at the bottom thereof, spaced a distance above the flared upper
end 42 of the outer conduit 24, a water filled pan 84. The cover 82 preferably also
includes a mesh 86 that spans between peripheries of the pan 84 and a dish-shaped
top lid 88. Preferably the lid 88 is opaque and reflective to reduce solar heating. The
mesh 86 prevents insects from entering the space between the pan 84 and the lid 88
while permitting atmosphere about the flared upper end 42 of the outer conduit 24 to
circulate therethrough. A depression 89 in the lid 88, preferably at the center thereof,
with a drip hole 90 formed therethrough, best illustrated in FIGs. 13, 15, 17 and 20,
permits collecting rain water used for filling the pan 84.
[0053]          In the illustration of FIG. 2, the building 22 and the coaxial ventilator 20 are
identical to those depicted in FIG. 1. The difference between FIGs. 2 and 1 are that the
small arrows within the annularly shaped space 72 and the inner conduit 62 differ from

                                               12
those in FIG. 1 since the small arrows in FIG. 2 depict the path of air as it flows during
daytime. The principal difference between nighttime and daytime airflows is that during
daytime there is no exchange of air between the annularly shaped space 72 and the
inner conduit 62. Rather, during daytime warmer air rises along the entire length of the
annularly shaped space 72 while cooler air descends along the entire length of the inner
conduit 62.
[0054]         FIGs. 4 and 5 illustrate an alternative embodiment of the present
disclosure in which a pair of coaxial ventilators 20a, 20b in accordance herewith
ventilate two (2) different rooms 46a, 46b during nighttime operation. Those elements
depicted in FIGs. 4 and 5 that are common to the coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in FIGs.
1 3 carry the same reference numeral distinguished by a prime ("' ") designation.
Lower segments of each of the coaxial ventilators 20a, 20b are juxtaposed with
opposite sides of the interior wall 52a'. As illustrated in FIGs. 4 and 5, above the roof
32' the pair of coaxial ventilators 20a, 20b preferably share a single cover 82'.
[0055]         FIG. 6 illustrates yet another alternative embodiment of the present
disclosure located in a multi-story building 22". Those elements depicted in FIGs. 6 that
are common to the coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in FIGs. 1 3 carry the same reference
numeral distinguished by a double prime (" " ") designation. The building 22" includes a
basement 92 having a heat source 94, i.e. a boiler or other warm appliance, located
therein. Radiation and thermal convection within the basement 92 warms the room 46"
through the floor 54". As depicted in FIG. 6, a coaxial ventilator 20" extends from the
basement 92 upward to a cooler upper room 36". Convection of warmer air via the
coaxial ventilator 20" between the basement 92 and the room 36" warms the room 36"
while cooler air descends from the room 36" to the basement 92.
[0056]         FIG. 7 depicts a preferred bell shaped flaring 98 of the lower end 44 of the
outer conduit 24. Preferably, as stated previously the lower end 68 of the inner conduit
62 is recessed slightly above the lower end 44 of the outer conduit 24. As depicted in
FIG. 7, the bell shaped flaring 98, essentially forming a funnel, begins slightly above the
lower end 68 of the inner conduit 62 and above the floor 38 of the room 36. The bell
shaped flaring 98 may be advantageously shaped to exploit the Coanda effect both for
separating the upward flow of warmer air from the downward flow of cooler air, and for
drawing the rising upward flow from a larger horizontal area around the lower end 44 of
the outer conduit 24. The funnel formed by the preferred bell shaped flaring 98 at the

                                               13
lower end 44 reduces drag and turbulence. Formed in this way the bell shaped flaring
98 establishes a transition zone having a wider space for stabilizing the upward flow of
warmer air and downward flow of cooler air and interference between them.
Industrial Applicability
[0057]         FIGs. 8 through 10 illustrate the coaxial ventilator 20 being used
advantageously for power production such as generating electricity. In the illustration of
FIG. 8, two (2) turbines 102 are located within the coaxial ventilator 20 respectively near
the top and bottom thereof. The turbines 102 are located in sections of the coaxial
ventilator 20 in which the inner conduit 62 lacks holes 63 and where there is maximum
flow and pressure differential to drive the turbines 102. While FIG. 8 depicts only two
(2) turbines 102, it is readily apparent that depending upon construction details a single
coaxial ventilator 20 may include more or fewer than two (2) turbines 102.
[0058]         As depicted in FIGs. 9 and 10, inner turbine blades 104 upon which cooler
air descending through the inner conduit 62 impinges preferably slant in a direction
opposite than outer turbine blades 106 upon which hotter air rising through the annularly
shaped space 72 impinges. Configured in this way, both the descending cooler air and
the rising hotter air urge the turbine 102 to rotate in the same direction. Preferably, to
advantageously exploit the Coriolis effect the slant direction of the inner turbine blades
104 and the outer turbine blades 106 differs depending upon whether the turbine 102 is
located in the Northern Hemisphere or Southern Hemisphere. Advantageously, the
slant of the inner turbine blades 104 and the outer turbine blades 106 may change
automatically thereby adapting them for differing air flow pressure and velocities
occurring throughout the day.
[0059]         Referring back to FIG. 8, during daylight hours solar heating of air within
the room 46 and the outer conduit 24 provides energy for driving the turbines 102 by
heating and expanding air therein. The air pressure increase associated with solar
heating and expansion enhances the updraft in annularly shaped space 72 between the
outer conduit 24 and the inner conduit 62 before the air escapes from the upper end 42.
Note that solar radiation impinging upon the outer conduit 24 heats air within the
annularly shaped space 72. Accordingly, for this particular application it is
advantageous to increase the height of the coaxial ventilator 20 that extends above the
roof 32. If during night time the air flows within the coaxial ventilator 20 reverse the

                                                 14
turbines 102 correspondingly reverse rotation which still provides power for generating
electricity.
[0060]        Rotation of the turbine 102 by hotter air impinging upon the outer turbine
blades 106 rotates the inner turbine blades 104 thereby drawing cooler air into the inner
conduit 62 to thereby increase the natural descent of cooler air within the inner conduit
62 and compress air within the room 46. After air flow within the coaxial ventilator 20
becomes stable for instance during daytime, the increased flow rates produced by solar
heating will be sufficient to overcome any slight back pressure due to increased air
pressure within the room 46.
[0061]        Daytime power production efficiency may be increased by including a non
return valve, not illustrated in FIGs. 8 10, at the lower end 68 of the inner conduit 62.
Such a non return valve increases daytime efficiencies by preventing reverse flow
through the inner conduit 62. However, including such a non return valve also prevents
the flow directions within the coaxial ventilator 20 from reversing for producing power
during the night.
[0062]        While less preferred and not illustrated in FIGs. 8-10, the turbines 102 may
instead include two (2) independent sets of contra-rotating blades 104, 106 both of
which sets slant in the same direction. Because such inner turbine blades 104 and
outer turbine blades 106 rotate in opposite directions, generating electricity with a single
generator requires coupling the blades 104, 106 together with a mechanical
transmission. Alternatively, electricity might be generated using two separate
generators respectively coupled independently to the inner turbine blades 104 and to
the outer turbine blades 106.
[0063]        Alternatively, if electricity is supplied to the turbines 102 rather than being
drawn therefrom, then the turbines 102 can be used advantageously for boosting air
flow through the coaxial ventilator 20.
[0064]        An alternative embodiment coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in FIGs. 11, 12,
13 and 14 further includes a liquid-filled thermosyphon cooling tube 124 that depends
beneath a pan 84 into an inner conduit 62 of the coaxial ventilator 20. In the illustrations
of FIGs. 11, 12, 13 and 14, the cooling tube 124 descends along a central axis of the
coaxial ventilator 20 to be thereby surrounded by the inner conduit 62. Disposed as
depicted in FIGs. 11, 12, 13 and 14, the cooling tube 124 advantageously increases
contact area for heat exchange cooling significantly between:

                                                15
        1.     water evaporating from a pan 84 located at the top of the coaxial ventilator
20; and
        2.     air within the coaxial ventilator 20 about the liquid-filled thermosyphon
cooling tube 124.
[0065]         In the embodiment depicted in FIGs. 11, 12, 13 and 14, the cooling tube
124 is filled with water 126 drawn from the pan 84. A drain tap 128 located at the
bottom of the cooling tube 124 permits drawing collected rainwater as a backup for
supplementary or emergency domestic water supply. The cooling tube 124 is prefera
bly made of copper or similarly high thermal conductivity material, and maybe be finned
or corrugated with heat conducting surfaces to increase the surface area for heat
exchange, or alternatively be of semi-permeable surfaces to increase the surface area
for water evaporation cooling.
[0066]         Adding a liquid-filled thermosyphon cooling tube 124 that includes a
perforated inner return tube, such as that described in United States Patent no.
6,014,968 and hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth here, to the
coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in FIGs. 1 3 effectively elongates the heat exchange area
of the evaporative cooling water-filled pan 84. Effectively elongating the heat exchange
area of the evaporative cooling water-filled pan 84 in this way increases cooling
capacity of a coaxial ventilator 20 without significantly increasing the overall size of the
coaxial ventilator 20. Extending the heat exchange area of the coaxial ventilator 20 by
including the thermosyphon cooling tube 124 therein increases heat exchange
efficiency between air within the coaxial ventilator 20 and evaporative cooling water
filled pan 84.
[0067]         The coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in FIGs. 11, 12, 13 and 14 passively,
cost effectively, and space efficiently uses evaporating rain water to capture and store
nighttime "coolness" for use during mornings and afternoons when it is most needed.
During dry weather, any rain water collected in the pan 84 can be augmented by
connecting a float valve controlled piped water supply to the upper evaporative cooling
water-filled pan 84 (not illustrated in any of the FIGs.). While evaporative cooling occurs
continuously throughout an entire day, however temperatures are coolest at night, i.e.
over 10 hours of nighttime evaporative cooling on average. Consequently, there exists
ample time during that 10 hour interval to cool water in the pan 84 down to nighttime
temperatures.

                                               16
[0068]         However, holding a sufficient quantity of water both for daytime cooling
needs, particularly to store nighttime cooling capacity, and for providing sufficient
evaporative heat exchange surface area, requires a quite large, heavy and unwieldy
water-filled pan 84 that is located above a building's roof. Frequently, without a large
pan 84 there is insufficient thermal storage capacity to extend nighttime "coolness" well
into the afternoons, and insufficient heat exchange area to transfer heat into air
descending down into the coaxial ventilator 20.
[0069]         FIGs. 15 and 16 depict an alternative embodiment of the coaxial ventilator
20 depicted in FIGs. 11, 12, 13 and 14. In the embodiment depicted in FIGs. 15 and 16
the water-filled thermosyphon cooling tube 124 below the pan 84 is surrounded by a
tube 132 illustrated by a dashed line in those FIGs. The tube 132:
        1.     preferably has a circular cross-section;
        2.     preferably is made of copper or similarly high thermal conductivity material
        to enhance heat exchange between liquids filling the tube 132 and the cooling
        tube 124; and
        3.     may be flexible, finned or corrugated.
[0070]         The tube 132 establishes an annularly shaped space 134 around the
cooling tube 124 that is preferably filled with oil 138 or other liquid having a specific heat
greater than that of water. In this way liquid filling the annularly shaped space 134
being in close thermal heat exchange contact with the cooling tube 124 increases
thermal storage capacity of the coaxial ventilator 20.
[0071]         FIG. 13A shows the bottom end of the cooling tube enlarged into a bulb
tank which may have radiative heat exchanger fins or other heat exchange surfaces at
the bottom at ceiling level to additionally directly radiatively and conductively cool the
room below. That is in addition to the cooled air convection taking place. It enlarges
the cooling surface area and water or oil storage capacity of the cooling tube 124, 126
and the annularly shaped space 134, as well as allowing direct radiative cooling to take
place into the room below, thus increasing the cooling efficiency. The bulb tank can be
adapted to all other Coaxial Ventilator configurations shown variously with cooling tube
124, 126, and annularly shaped space 134, etc. Enlarging the water storage
capacity helps when the Coaxial Ventilator is also used as a water storage tank (water
storage tank function not applicable to Fig 17 where oil is the storage medium) for the
building or house, thus saving on the cost of a normal household or building water

                                              17
storage tank. In this case when the bulb tank forms part of the water storage tank
capacity (in addition to the cooling tube 124, 126, and the evaporative water pan 84
above) an additional water draw off pipe or drain tap 128 would be drawn off the bulb
tank at the lowest level of the bulb tank at ceiling level to be used in the rooms below
(additional ceiling level water draw off pipe not shown in Fig 13A).
[0072]         As illustrated by dashed lines in FIGs. 15 and 16, the performance of the
thermosyphon cooling tube coaxial ventilator 20 illustrated in those FIGs. can be further
enhanced by extending the annularly shaped space 134 along the length of the
thermosyphon cooling tube 124 upward and outward beneath the pan 84. This
extension of the tube 132 upward and outward permits the liquid having a specific heat
greater than that of water to contact the bottom of the pan 84.
[0073]         In this way the thermosyphon cooling tube coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in
FIGs. 15 and 16 having the double layer pan 84 and cooling tube 124 filled on the inside
with water 126 that is surrounded by and separated from the liquid that fills the tube 132
and that has a specific heat greater than that of water:
        1.     permits using a smaller diameter water-filled pan 84; and
        2.     further increases the cooling storage capacity of the coaxial ventilator 20.
[0074]         Furthermore, the thermosyphon cooling tube coaxial ventilator 20 depicted
in FIGs. 15 and 16 simplifies suspending the coaxial thermosyphon cooling tube coaxial
ventilator 20 in comparison with supporting an alternative coaxial ventilator 20 having a
larger roof top water-filled pan 84.
[0075]         While the cooling tube preferably is a thermosyphon cooling tube 124, the
inner return tube included in a thermosyphon cooling tube 124 may be omitted although
this reduces cooling tube efficiency. If the return tube of the cooling tube 124 is omitted,
then its outer tube must:
        1.     have a larger diameter than that of the cooling tube 124 if the cooling tube
is to achieve the same amount of heat transfer; or
        2.     if of the same outer diameter as the cooling tube 124, have a shorter
length than that of the thermosyphon cooling tube 124 and can provide only a lesser
amount of heat transfer due to stagnation inefficiencies and inversion layer formation
that results from the tube's smaller diameter.

                                                18
[0076]          In yet another alternative embodiment of the coaxial ventilator 20 depicted
in FIG. 17 the lower portion of the covered pan 84 and the cooling tube 124 are filled
with oil 138 rather than water. The cooling tube 124 and the pan 84 are first filled with
oil 138 up to approximately half the depth of the pan 84. The pan 84 above the oil is
then filled with:
         1.     rain water collected through the lid 88; or
         2.     water from a piped supply controlled by a float valve (not illustrated in any
         of the FIGs.).
[0077]          In the configuration depicted in FIG. 17, the drain tap 128 is not used for
drawing collected rainwater. Rather, the drain tap 128 at the bottom of the cooling tube
124 is now opened only when the oil has to be drained off for servicing the cooling tube
124, or for changing of the oil, probably once every three or four years.
[0078]          The oil chosen for use in the alternative embodiment depicted in FIG. 17:
         1.     must be immiscible in water;
         2.     must be heavier than water;
         3.     should not evaporate at room temperatures;
        4.      should remain liquid and free flowing at room and ambient temperatures;
         and
         5.     have a much higher specific heat capacity than water.
[0079]          For such an oil, water in the pan 84 floating on the oil and cooled by
evaporation sinks and contacts the oil to thereby cool the oil below.
[0080]          Layering water for evaporation above oil, with oil extending down into the
thermosyphon cooling tube 124 including the inner return tube, increases the cooling
capacity of the cooling tube 124 by:
         1.     using oil to store the "coolness;" while
         2.     still permitting the water to evaporate and cool the oil below.
[0081]          And this is done without incurring additional structural cost of a double
walled pan 84 and/or a double walled cooling tube as was shown in FIGs. 15 and 16
etc., or otherwise having to enlarge the cooling tube and coaxial ventilator 20. For the
embodiments of the coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in FIGs. 15 through 17, material

                                                19
forming the cooling tube 124 and the surrounding tube 132 must be impervious so the
liquid therein cannot evaporate or leak out.
[0082]         The illustrations of FIGs. 18 and 19 depict yet another alternative
embodiment coaxial ventilator 20 which includes multiple liquid-filled cooling tubes 124.
Similar to the cooling tube 124 depicted in FIGs. 11 and 12, each of the cooling tubes
124 respectively descends downward from the covered pan 84. However rather than
descending along the central axis surrounded by the inner conduit 62, the multiple
cooling tubes 124 depicted in FIGs. 18 and 19 descend into an annularly shaped space
72 located between the inner conduit 62 and an outer conduit 24 of the coaxial
ventilator 20. In the embodiment of the coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in FIGs. 18 and
19, the cooling tubes 124 may have the same configuration as any of the various
different types of cooling tubes that are described in greater detail above and depicted
in FIGs. 11 through FIG. 17.
[0083]         Referring now to FIGs. 20 and 21, the outer conduit 24 of the coaxial
ventilator 20 depicted in those FIGs. is encircled by a pair of optional, hollow collar
flanges 142 respectively located:
        1.     above the roof 32 of the building 22; and
        2.     at a ceiling 34 within the building 22 through which the coaxial ventilator
20 passes.
[0084]         Encircling the outer conduit 24 with the collar flanges 142 establishes an
open, annularly shaped space 144 between the outer conduit 24 and the roof 32 and
ceiling 34 respectively about the coaxial ventilator 20. The annularly shaped spaces
144 facilitate ventilating spaces within the building 22 both below and above each of the
collar flanges 142.
[0085]         At the roof 32, attached to a hole through the roof 32, the collar flange 142
includes a collar flashing 152 that extends upward a distance above the roof 32
sufficient to impede rainwater from splashing from the roof 32 into the annularly shaped
space 144. Because the upper end of the collar flashing 152 is smaller in diameter than
the pan 84, the upper opening of the collar flashing 152 about the outer conduit 24 is
inherently somewhat shielded from the entry of rainwater. Where the coaxial ventilator
20 penetrates the ceiling 34, the collar flange 142 includes an open annular collar 156
that passes through the ceiling 34 and extends a short distance above and below the
ceiling 34.

                                                20
[0086]         The upper end of the collar flange 142 extending above the roof 32
preferably includes flap shutters 162 that may be closed both to block airflow through
the collar flange 142 and the entry of rainwater thereinto. Correspondingly, the collar
flange 142 extending through the ceiling 34 preferably includes dampeners 166 that
may be rotated to a closed position to block airflow through the collar flange 142.
[0087]          Both collar flanges 142 respectively located at the roof 32 and at the
ceiling 34 when open provide additional ventilation that reduces any build up or
stagnation of warm air about the coaxial ventilator 20 at the roof 32 and the ceiling 34.
Including the collar flanges 142 about the coaxial ventilator 20 advantageously keeps
the immediate vicinity of the coaxial ventilator 20 cooler thereby improving its efficiency
in transferring cool air from the pan 84 to the room 36 below without the air becoming
unduly heated.
[0088]         As illustrated in FIG. 20, the coaxial ventilator 20 depicted in any of the
various FIGs. may also include as set of dampeners 172 located at the lower end of the
coaxial ventilator 20. In climates which experience both heat in summer and cold in
winter, both the shutters 162 and the dampeners 166 as well as the dampeners 172 are
left open during summer so hot air can escape from the building 22, and closed in
winter to conserve heat within the building 22.
[0089]          FIG. 22 illustrates the outer conduit 24 using a space in the form of the
roof cavity (i.e. the area between the roof 32 and ceiling 34) to channel airflow to and/or
from the ends of the outer conduit 24. The roof cavity therefore acts, in part, as the
outer conduit 24, with the collar flanges 142 establishing an annular space 144 at the
roof 32 and ceiling 34 levels. This arrangement saves costs, due to a reduction in the
amount of materials, but some flow inefficiencies are introduce due to some air flow
mixing in the roof cavity. However, air flow is still able to readily pass by the lower end
of the inner conduit 62 into / from the roof cavity. That is, at least part of the air may flow
in a substantially linear direction from near the lower end of the inner conduit to the
upper end of the outer conduit 24, or vice versa.
[0090]          FIG. 23 illustrates a coaxial ventilator with an outer conduit 24' having
perforations (i.e. holes) in its outer wall. This allows air to flow from the roof cavity into
the inner portion of the outer conduit 24' and vice versa. The roof cavity therefore acts
as an expanded outer conduit 24'.

                                                 21
[0091]           FIG. 24 illustrates a further coaxial ventilator with, in a similar manner to
FIG 22., the outer conduit 24 using a space in the form of the roof cavity to channel
airflow. It will be appreciated that in other alternative forms perforations may be included
in the outer conduit 24, in a similar manner to FIG. 23. Cooling tubes 124, 126 extend
from the water pan 84 in FIG. 24 and are located within the inner conduit 62. The
cooling tubes 124, 126 extend beyond the lower end of the inner conduit 62 and this
may allow, for example, the discharge valve 128 to be easily accessible.
[0092]           The cooling tubes 124, 126 bias the flow in the inner conduit 62 in a
downwards manner when the cooling tubes 124, 126 are sufficiently cooler than the
outer conduit 24. On this basis, if the water in the cooling tubes 124, 126 is not of
sufficiently lower temperature to influence or bias the air flow in the conduits, the
influence of the cooling tubes 124, 126 is less effective. Accordingly, the air flows are
reversible based upon temperature differential horizontally across the coaxial ventilator.
