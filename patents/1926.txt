   2013323858, as originally filed and as amended, is incorporated herein by reference.
   Field of the Invention
10  The present invention relates to swimming pool cleaners and, more particularly, to automatic
    swimming pool cleaners movable along an underwater pool surface for purposes of cleaning
    debris therefrom. Still more particularly, this invention relates to swimming pool cleaners
    having the flow of water pumped and/or sucked by remote pumps into and through the pool
    cleaners.
15
    Background of the Invention
   Automatic swimming pool cleaners of the type that move about the underwater surfaces of a
    swimming pool are driven by many different kinds of systems. A variety of different pool
20  cleaner devices in one way or another harness the flow of water, as it is drawn or pushed
    through the pool cleaner by the pumping action of a remote pump for debris collection
   purposes.
    Suction automatic pool cleaners are very successful when there is fine debris or debris that
25 become soft in water. This fine debris is sucked up by the cleaner and deposited into a pump
   basket, or other debris-collection device, and the really fine debris passes into the pool filter.
   An example of a suction cleaner is disclosed in commonly-owned United States Patent No.
    6,854,148 (Rief et al.), entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
30  Suction automatic swimming pool cleaners are used in places with much sand and slit.
   Although suction cleaners can take leafy debris once it has softened in the pool, large debris

   I: \td\Intrwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16203599 Idocx-I9 12/2017
                                                              -2
    such and large acorns and hard leafs would plug up a suction cleaner. Suction swimming pool
    cleaners are also limited to the debris size due to loss of suction if the inlet and/or outlet
    orifices are widened to accommodate such large debris and the possibility of large debris
    clogging the pool pipes.
 5
    Conversely, pressure automatic swimming pool cleaners are very successful when there is
    large debris such as leaves and acorns, these large debris are pulled off the pool surface by
   virtue of a venturi effect and are placed into a debris-collection device, such as a bag, above
   the cleaner. An example of a pressure cleaner is disclosed in commonly-owned United States
10 Patent No. 6,782,578 (Rief et al.), entire contents of which are incorporated herein by
   reference. With a pressure swimming pool cleaner, the limitation is the opposite to the suction
    cleaner. In removing very large debris from the swimming pool, a pressure cleaner uses a
    collection bag or other receptacle. Regardless of how fine the walls of such receptacle are,
    sand and slit can pass through the them back into the pool.
15
    The problem is that most often only one cleaner is used in a pool. Therefore, people have
    either a suction cleaner or a pressure cleaner. Many swimming-pool builders place a suction
    cleaner into a pool when it is built. This is because there is no real landscaping around the pool
    at the time of the cleaner installation. However, just few years later, when trees and bushes
20 have grown up, the debris becomes overwhelming and constantly plugs the suction cleaner.
    Still with the pressure cleaner, no matter how large debris is in the pool, there is always sand
    and slit from cement and other elements of the surrounding environment. Such fine debris will
   pass through the debris-collection bag back into the pool. Although some swimming pool
25 pressure cleaners have tails that supposedly whip the debris toward the main drain, in reality
    such tails only bring the dirt into suspension until it falls back on the pool bottom to start the
   process all over again.
   Attempts have been made to utilize both a suction power and a pressure flow from remote
30 pumps by the same swimming pool cleaner apparatus. One such apparatus is disclosed in
   United States Patent No. 5,099,535 (Chauvier et al.). The apparatus of the Chauvier et al.

   I: \td\Intrwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16203599 _.docx-I9 12/2017
                                                               -3
   patent is connected to both a pressure and suction remote pumps at the same time. However,
    only the suction hose is used for removal of the debris from the swimming pool underwater
    surface. The Chauvier et al. cleaner utilizes the pressure flow only for displacement of the
    cleaner along the underwater pool surface such that the Chauvier et al. cleaner remains a
 5  suction cleaner at all times and retains disadvantages of suction cleaners described earlier.
    Therefore, to remove large or hard debris from the swimming pool, one would have to use a
    separate cleaner or cleaning method which accommodates successful removal of such large
    debris. It should further be noted that, because suction and pressure line connectors are not in
   the same vicinity of a swimming pool, the connection to both lines at the same, as proposed by
10 the Chauvier et al. patent, is practically not possible.
   United States Patent No. 7,168,120 (Habif et al.) discloses a pressure-fed vacuum swimming
   pool cleaning robot. The robot of the Habif et al. patent has a structure which extends from a
    debris-inlet end applied to the swimming-pool underwater surface to an opposite debris-outlet
15  end which is distal from the underwater surface. In the robot of the Habif et al. patent, the
    suction is always created at the debris-outlet end by either a connection of the debris-outlet
    end to a suction hose or by creating a venturi effect at the debris-outlet. The structure of the
   Habif et al. patent consistently operates as a suction cleaner which successfully removes only
    fine or very soft debris. This structure is not configured for removal of large and hard debris
20 which would plug up the debris inlet as well as inner passages of the Habif et al. robot.
    Therefore, as with the Chauvier et al. patent, large or hard debris would have to be removed
    from the swimming pool by a separate cleaner different from the robot of the Habif et al.
   patent or by some other means designed for removal of such large debris.
25 Also, in some states law requires variable speed pumps. It would be beneficial to have a
    cleaner which consistently provides an efficient performance with pumps running at lower or
    higher rates and is successful in removing both fine and large debris from the swimming-pool
   underwater surface.
30  It would be desirable to have a pool cleaner allowing manufacturing to be standardized and the
    end user have easy accessability to the cleaner parts for maintenance.

                                                               -4
    Summary Of The Invention
    This invention is an improved swimming pool cleaner of the type movable along an
 5 underwater pool surface to clean debris therefrom. The swimming pool cleaner of the present
    invention provides an important advantage of substantially strain-free and tool-free assembly.
    The swimming pool cleaner includes a body having a debris inlet and a debris outlet. A
    segmented skirt includes a plurality of flap members each of which extends from a proximal
10  end hinged to the body to a distal end which is configured for extending along the pool surface
    such that the skirt forms with the pool surface a plenum from which water and debris are
    drawn into the inlet. The body defines an elongate slotted cavity extending between two ends
    and pivotably holding the proximal ends of the flap members therewithin. The slotted cavity
   has an openable inlet-adjacent middle region permitting strain- free insertion of the flap
15 member proximal ends into the cavity for sliding therealong. The cleaner further includes a
   nozzle inserted into the debris inlet to control debris-laden water flow. The nozzle is
   positioned over the middle region of the slotted cavity retaining the flap-member proximal
    ends in the cavity.
20  The slotted cavity may be formed by first and second wall portions separated by a slot. In
    some embodiments, a first wall-portion configuration being continuous between the closed
    side ends, and a second wall-portion configuration being interrupted along the inlet-adjacent
   middle region permitting strain- free insertion of the flap-member proximal ends into the
    cavity.
25
   In certain embodiments, the first and second wall-portion configurations each include a
   plurality of spaced tabs holding the flap-member proximal ends. In some of such
    embodiments, the second configuration is lacking the tabs along the inlet-adjacent middle
   region thereby opening access for sliding the flap-member proximal ends in or out of the
30  cavity for strain-free assembly of the segmented skirt.

   I: \td\Intrwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16203599 Idocx-I9 12/2017
                                                              -5
    The cleaner body may also include a frame structure extending laterally from the debris inlet
    along the slotted cavity. In such versions, the tabs of the second wall-portion configuration
   protrude from the frame structure thereby have a reinforced configuration minimizing
   breakage of the tabs.
 5
    The nozzle has two opposite lateral sides and a cavity-adjacent side therebetween. In some
    embodiments, the nozzle includes at least one tab extending from the cavity-adjacent side over
   the cavity thereby closing the inlet-adjacent middle region and retaining the flap-member
   proximal ends within the cavity by providing continuity for the second wall-portion
10  configuration.
   In certain embodiments, the nozzle is removable from the debris inlet and is configured for
    engagement with the frame structure which holds the nozzle within the debris inlet. The pool
    cleaner may include a plurality of interchangeable nozzles each of which having a flow
15  opening which is different in size than flow openings of the other nozzles.
    Such varying in size nozzle permits easy adjustment of the inlet size to accommodate the size
    of debris falling into the pool. The nozzle with a larger nozzle opening will allow large debris
    such as leaves, plant seeds and the like to pass through while the nozzles with a small or
20 medium flow opening may not be able to pass such debris through. Furthermore, the
    interchangeable nozzles of the present invention consistently provide a required efficient
   performance of the cleaner with variable speed pumps. The interchangeable nozzles of the
   present invention consistently provide a required efficient performance of the cleaner. In
   particular, when the pump runs at a lower rate, the nozzle with the smaller flow opening will
25 provide the required performance. And, when the pump runs at a high rate, the nozzle with the
    larger flow opening will have the required performance.
   In some embodiments of the present invention, the pool cleaner may be interchangeably
   usable as a suction cleaner for removal of fine debris such as sand and slit and as a pressure
30  cleaner for removal of large and hard debris such as large leaves, acorns and stones. In such
    embodiments, the body is adapted at the debris outlet for securement of either a water-suction

   I: \td\Intrwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16203599 Idocx-I9 12/2017
                                                              -6
   hose connected to a remote suction system or a debris-collection device entrapping debris and
   passing water therethrough back into the pool. When the cleaner is used as a pressure cleaner,
   the one of the nozzles which has the larger flow opening is secured with respect to the body.
   When the cleaner is used as a suction cleaner, the inlet size can be reduced by installing that
 5  one of the nozzles which has the smaller flow opening.
   In certain embodiments, the pool cleaner includes a tool-free nozzle mounting. Such tool-free
   nozzle mounting includes a pair of lateral protrusions each extending from one of the lateral
    sides of the nozzle and a pair of frame-structure side portions extending laterally from the inlet
10  and each engaging the corresponding lateral protrusion of the nozzle thereby retaining the
   nozzle within the debris inlet.
   Each protrusion may have a first surface substantially orthogonal to the nozzle lateral side and
    a second surface sloping between the first surface and the nozzle lateral side. The orthogonal
15  surface allows pressing on the corresponding side body portion and the sloping surface
   permits release of the nozzle from the inlet. Each side portion of the frame structure includes a
    spring-grip inwardly displaceable when pressed by the corresponding lateral protrusion of the
   nozzle being inserted into the debris inlet. The nozzle is being inserted beyond the spring-grip
   which resiliently returns into alignment with the side portion thereby locking the nozzle within
20 the inlet.
   In some embodiments, each side portion of the frame structure extends outwardly from the
    debris inlet thereby forming a tapered surface minimizing entrapment of the cleaner on step
    like pool structures.
25
   In certain embodiments, the pool cleaner also includes a tool-free wheel-mounting assembly
   which supports at least one pair of wheels moving the cleaner along the pool surface. The tool
    free wheel-mounting assembly includes each of the wheels having a ball bearing rotatably
   holding such wheel on a non-rotating shaft extending laterally from the respective side of the
30  cleaner body, each ball-bearing having an interior configuration matching an exterior
    configuration of the shaft in non-rotating engagement therewith. Each shaft may have a

   I: \td\Intrwovn\NRPortbl\DCC\TLD\16203599 _.docx-I9 12/2017
                                                               -7
   polygonal exterior with each bearing having a polygonal interior matching the shaft exterior in
   non-rotating engagement therewith. The ball bearing may be a double-race bearing in non
   rotating engagement with the respective wheel.
 5 In some versions, each shaft has a hollow interior with an inwardly-facing shoulder
   therewithin. In such versions, the tool-free wheel-mounting assembly includes a removable
    clip inserted into the shaft interior and in a locking engagement with the shoulder. The clip has
    at least two fingers which extend from an exterior head and terminate with a hook-end within
   the shaft interior. The fingers are being pressed together upon insertion into the shaft and
10  spreading outwardly into the locking engagement with the shoulder thereby securely holding
   the wheel on the shaft.
   Another aspect of the present invention is a method for tool-free assembly of the swimming
   pool cleaner. In this method, the nozzle is installed by pressing the spring-grip with the nozzle
15  into the inlet until the nozzle is beyond the spring-grip which resiliently returns to its original
    orientation thereby locking the nozzle within the inlet.
    The inventive method also includes the step of hingedly attaching the segmented skirt to the
   body. The skirt is attached to the body in a stain-free fashion. In particular, prior to installing
20 the nozzle, a proximal end (also referred to as an attaching end) of each flap member is freely
   places into the open inlet-adjacent middle region of the slotted cavity. The flap members are
    secured within the cavity by the step of installing the nozzle being positioned over and closing
   the inlet-adjacent middle region.
25  The tool-free assembly method also may further include a step of tool-free mounting of the
   wheels by sliding the ball-bearing polygonal interior of each wheel over the corresponding
   matching polygonal shaft exterior for a non-rotating engagement therebetween. In such
    embodiments, the ball bearing provides wheel rotation. The wheel is securely held on the shaft
   by the removable clip inserted into the shaft interior and into a locking engagement with the
30  shoulder.

   Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments
   FIGURES 1-21 illustrate exemplary embodiments of aspects of the present invention for an
15  improved swimming pool cleaner 100 of the type movable along an underwater pool surface 2
    to clean debris therefrom.
    FIGURES 1 and 18-20 illustrate swimming pool cleaner 100 including a body 10 having a
    debris inlet 11 and a debris outlet 12. As best seen in FIGURES 1-3, a segmented skirt 20
20  includes a plurality of flap members 21 each of which extends from a proximal (or mounting)
    end 22 hinged to body 10 to a distal end 23 which is configured for extending along pool
    surface 2 such that skirt 20 forms with pool surface 2 a plenum from which water and debris
    are drawn into inlet 11, as best illustrated in FIGURE 19. FIGURES 1-3, 5 and 18 show body
    10 defining an elongate slotted cavity 40 extending between two ends 41 and pivotably
25 holding proximal ends 22 of flap members 21 therewithin.
    Prior to this invention, proximal ends of the skirt were clipped into the slotted cavity. Such
    clipping created stress on the cavity walls and skirt retaining structures which would later
    easily break later after the exposure to pool chemicals and deterioration of the plastic materials
30  of which the body is made.

                                                              - 10
   FIGURES 1-3 show that inventive cleaner 100 has slotted cavity 40 with an openable inlet
    adjacent middle region 42 permitting strain- free insertion of flap-member proximal ends 22
    into cavity 40. FIGURE 1 shows skirt 20 including forward and rear sets of flap members 21
   A and 2 IB. Each set includes a pair of end flap members 21 which are inserted into middle
 5 region 42 for sliding along cavity 40 toward their installed positions at a respective end 41.
   Each set is also shown to include a pair of middle flap members 21 which are inserted into
   middle region 42 in their installed position adjacent inlet 11. FIGURES 1-3 best illustrate
   proximal ends 23 of flap members 21 having a substantially cylindrical shape and cavity 40
   being configured to substantially conform such cylindrical shape (see FIGURE 5) with a slot
10 44 being configured and dimensioned to permit pivoting of flap members 21, as seen in
   FIGURE 3.
   FIGURES 2-4 show a nozzle 30 inserted into debris inlet 11 to control debris-laden water
    flow. As best seen in FIGURE 3, nozzle 30 is positioned over middle region 42 of slotted
15  cavity 40 thus retaining flap-member proximal ends 22 in cavity 40. Nozzle 30 is installed
    over proximal ends 21 of the middle flap members 41.
   FIGURES 2 and 5 best show slotted cavity 40 formed by first and second wall portions 45 and
   46 separated by slot 44. FIGURES 1 and 18 show a first wall-portion configuration 45 A
20  continuously between ends 41 which are shown as closed side ends. A second wall-portion
    configuration 46 A is shown as being interrupted along inlet-adjacent middle region 42 to
   permit strain- free insertion of flap-member proximal ends 22 into cavity 40. Such strain- free
    and tool-less skirt assembly also permits for easy replacement of worn flap members by the
    end user without any tools.
25
   FIGURES 1 and 18 further show first and second wall-portion configurations 45 A and 46A
    each including a plurality of spaced tabs 17 holding flap-member proximal ends 22. Second
    configuration 46A lacks tabs 17 along inlet-adjacent middle region 42 thereby opening access
    for strain-free insertion or removal of flap-member proximal ends 22 in or out of cavity 40 for
30  strain-free assembly of segmented skirt 20.

   FIGURES 1, 6-11 and 18 show cleaner body 10 also including a frame structure 18 extending
    laterally from debris inlet 11 along slotted cavity 40. It is further seen in FIGURES 1 and 18
   that tabs 17 of second wall-portion configuration 46A protrude from frame structure 18
   thereby being reinforced to minimize breakage of tabs 17.
 5
   FIGURES 1, 6, 8, 10 and 18 also show frame structure 18 extending laterally and outwardly
    from debris inlet 11 thereby forming a pair of tapered surfaces 181 minimizing entrapment of
    cleaner 100 on step-like pool structures. Such angled surfaces give the cleaner an ability to
    slide off any step or pool ledge, thus minimizing stopping of the cleaner on such pool
10  structures.
   FIGURE 4 shows nozzle 30 having two opposite lateral sides 31 and two opposite cavity
    adjacent sides 32 therebetween. Nozzle 30 includes tabs 33 extending from each of cavity
    adjacent sides 32 over cavity 40 thereby closing inlet-adjacent middle region 42 and retaining
15  flap-member proximal ends 22 within cavity 40 by providing continuity for second wall
   portion configuration 46A.
    FIGURES 2, 3 and 6-11 show nozzle 30 being removable from debris inlet 11 and configured
    for engagement with frame structure 18 which holds nozzle within debris inlet 11.
20
    FIGURES 19 and 20 show body 10 defininig a water-flow chamber 13 through which water
   passes from debris inlet 11 to debris outlet 12. Illustrated swimming pool cleaner 100 is of the
    type motivated by water flow through it to move cleaner 100 along underwater pool surface 2
    to be cleaned. As seen in FIGURES 19 and 20, turbine 14 is rotatably mounted within water
25  flow chamber 13 and has turbine vanes 141 which are moved by the water flow to rotate
    turbine 14.
    The improved cleaner of this invention provides excellent power and drive particularly when
    the turbine is in the highly preferred forms which are the subject of co-owned U.S. Pat. Nos.

    The removability of nozzle 30 allows easy access to chamber 13 through inlet 11 such that the
    end user may remove any debris entrapped within turbine 14 without any need for opening an
   upper housing of the cleaner. Furthermore, in cleaner 100 with removable nozzle 30, body 10
    can be molded as one standard configuration without the need for sonic welding of threaded
 5  inserts onto body 10. This also positively affects storage of body 10 which is a lower body
   piece for cleaner like cleaner 100. Prior to this invention, in cleaners with a non-removable
   nozzle and smaller flow opening, the lower body had to have a separate molding process.
   As illustrated in FIGURES 6-11 nozzle 30 is installed and is removable without any tools.
10 Pool cleaner 100 includes a tool-free nozzle mounting which includes a pair of lateral
   protrusions 34 each extending from one of lateral sides 31 of nozzle 30 and a pair of frame
    structure side portions 19 extending laterally from inlet 11 and each engaging the
    corresponding lateral protrusion 34 of nozzle 30 thereby retaining nozzle 30 within debris inlet
    11. Each side portion 19 of frame structure 18 includes a spring-grip 16 inwardly displaceable
15 when pressed by the corresponding lateral protrusion 34 of nozzle 30 being inserted into
    debris inlet 11.
   As best seen in FIGURES 7, 9 and 11, each protrusion 34 has a first surface 35 substantially
    orthogonal to nozzle lateral side 31 and a second surface 36 sloping between first surface 35
20  and nozzle lateral side 31. FIGURES 6-9 illustrate installation of nozzle 30 by pressing
    orthogonal surface 35 of nozzle 30 on the corresponding spring-grip 16 (see FIGURES 6 and
    7) to pass nozzle 30 toward inlet 11 and beyond spring-grip 16 which resiliently returns to its
    original orientation in alignment with side portion 19 thereby locking nozzle 30 within inlet 11
    (see
25
   FIGURES 8 and 9). FIGURES 10 and 11 illustrate how sloping surface 36 permits release of
   nozzle 30 from inlet 11 by pressing each side portion 19 inwardly beyond orthogonal surface
    34 of nozzle 30 which is then free for removal from inlet 11.
30  Cleaner 100 has a plurality of nozzles 30A, 30B and 30C for being interchangeably used with
    cleaner 100. FIGURES 12-14 show each of nozzles 30A, 30B and 30C having a flow opening

    37 A, 37B and 37C which is different in size than flow openings 37 of other nozzles 30. Such
   varying in size nozzle permits easy adjustment of the inlet size to accommodate the size of
    debris falling into the pool. Nozzle 30C with larger flow opening 37C will allow large debris
    such as leaves, plant seeds and the like to pass through while nozzles 30A and 30B with small
 5  and medium flow openings 37A and 37B may not be able to pass such debris through.
   Interchangeable nozzles 30 also accommodate variable speed pumps such that when the pump
   runs at a lower rate, nozzle 30A with smaller flow opening 37A will provide the required
   performance. And, when the pump runs at medium or high rate, nozzles 30B and 30C with
10 medium and larger flow openings 37B and 37C will have the required performance.
   FIGURE 20 illustrates pool cleaner 200 which may be interchangeably usable as a suction
    cleaner and as a pressure cleaner. FIGURE 20 shows body 1OA adapted at debris outlet 12 for
    securement of either a water-suction hose connected to a remote suction system or a debris
15  collection device entrapping debris and passing water therethrough back into the pool. When
    cleaner 200 is used as a pressure cleaner, nozzle 30C which has larger flow opening 37C is
    secured with respect to body 10A. When cleaner 200 is used as a suction cleaner, the inlet size
    can be reduced by installing nozzle 30A which has the smaller flow opening 37 A.
20 FIGURES 15-18 illustrate a tool- free wheel-mounting assembly 50.
   FIGURES 18-20 show a one pair of wheels 51 for moving cleaner 100 along pool surface 2.
   FIGURES 15-17 illustrate tool-free wheel-mounting assembly 50 as including a ball bearing
    52 for each of wheels 51 and rotatably holding such wheel 51 on a non-rotating shaft 53
25  extending laterally from the respective side 15 of cleaner body 10. It is seen in FUGREsl6 and
    17 that each ball-bearing 52 has an interior configuration 520 matching an exterior
    configuration 530 of shaft 53 such that ball bearing 52 and shaft 53 are in non-rotating
    engagement with each other. Each shaft exterior 530 and each bearing interior 520 are shown
    in FIGURE 18 as having a polygonal configuration. FIGURE 18 also illustrates other possible
30  shaft exterior and bearing-interior configurations, including polygons with 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10
    sides. One such configuration may be round with a protrusion on one of the shaft exterior 530

    and the bearing interior 520 and a conforming cavity on the other one of the shaft exterior 530
    and the bearing interior 520 such that shaft 53 and bearing 52 are locked in non-rotating
    engagement therebetween. When this configuration is round, ball bearing 52 is closely fitted
    over shaft 53 to prevent rotation therebetween.

   Prior to this invention, shoulder bolts had to be used for securing wheels to the cleaner body.
    The shoulder bolts have shown to wear fairly quickly resulting in wheel hubs getting an
   undesirable lateral movement. Such lateral movement negatively affects a sonic molding of
   wheel-supporting parts to the body such that the sonic molding is separated and the wheel
10  supporting parts being removed out of the body.
   FIGURES 15-17 show ball bearing 52 as a double-race bearing which is in a non-rotating
    engagement with respective wheel 51. The bearings have shown superior rotating properties
    and through extended tests exhibited wear and tear as well as their overall performance
15  significantly better than prior wheel-assembly configurations. The tool-less wheel assembly
   which provided for easy disasssembly gives the end used an ability to easily replace bearings
    in the wheel hubs without the need for any special tools.
   FIGURES 16 and 17 show each shaft having a hollow interior 531 with an inwardly- facing
20  shoulder 55 inside shaft 53. Tool-free wheel-mounting assembly 50 also includes a removable
    clip 53 which is inserted into shaft interior 531 into a locking engagement with shoulder 55, as
    seen in FIGURE 17. FIGURES 16 and 17 further show clip 56 having at least two fingers 561
   which extend from an exterior head 562 and terminate with a hook-end 563 within shaft
    interior 531. Fingers 561 are being pressed together upon insertion into shaft 53 and then
25  spread out inside shaft 53 into the locking engagement with shoulder 55 thereby securely
   holding wheel 51 on shaft 53, as illustrated in FIGURE 17.
   While the principles of the invention have been shown and described in connection with
    specific embodiments, it is to be understood that such embodiments are by way of example
30  and are not limiting.
