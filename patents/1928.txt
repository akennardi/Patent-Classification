                                 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001a]         The field of this invention generally relates to antibodies that bind to human
folate receptor 1 (FOLR1), methods of detecting FOLR1, methods of diagnosing and treating
cancer, and diagnostic assays and kits for FOLRI-based therapies.
                          BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]          Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the developed world, with over
one million people diagnosed with cancer and 500,000 deaths per year in the United States
alone. Overall it is estimated that more than 1 in 3 people will develop some form of cancer
during their lifetime. There are more than 200 different types of cancer, four of which-breast,
lung, colorectal, and prostate-account for over half of all new cases (Jemal et al., 2003,
CancerJ.Clin. 53:5-26).
[0003]          Folate Receptor 1 (FOLR1), also known as Folate Receptor-alpha or Folate
Binding Protein, is an N-glycosylated protein expressed on plasma membrane of cells. FOLR1
has a high affinity for folic acid and for several reduced folic acid derivatives. FOLR1 mediates
delivery of the physiological folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, to the interior of cells.
[0004]          FOLR1 is overexpressed in the vast majority of ovarian cancers, as well as in
many uterine, endometrial, pancreatic, renal, lung, and breast cancers, while the expression of
FOLR1 on normal tissues is restricted to the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the kidney
proximal tubules, alveolar pneumocytes of the lung, bladder, testes, choroid plexus, and thyroid
(Weitman SD, et al., Cancer Res 52: 3396-3401 (1992); Antony AC, Annu Rev Nutr 16: 501
521 (1996); Kalli KR, et al. Gynecol Oncol 108: 619-626 (2008)). This expression pattern of
FOLR1 makes it a desirable target for FOLR1 -directed cancer therapy.
                                                 -1 -

[0005]         Because ovarian cancer is typically asymptomatic until advanced stage, it is
often diagnosed at a late stage and has poor prognosis when treated with currently available
procedures, typically chemotherapeutic drugs after surgical de-bulking (von Gruenigen V et al.,
Cancer 112: 2221-2227 (2008); Ayhan A et al., Am J Obstet Gynecol 196: 81 e81-86 (2007);
Harry VN et al., Obstet Gynecol Surv 64: 548-560 (2009)). Thus there is a clear unmet medical
need for more effective therapeutics for ovarian cancers.

 [00061          Some previous assays used to detect shed FOLRl are not sufficiently specific to
 FOLR1.     For example, some assays do not distinguish between FOLR1 and other folate receptor
 family members (FOLR2, 3, & 4) or report values for total FBP (Folate Binding Protein).
 Additionally, some assays require that human samples (e.g., plasma) be pre-treated with a light acid
 wash step to dissociate folic acid from the receptor. Some assay results may also have inaccuracies
 due to competitive effects between the antibody therapy and diagnostic antibody. Additionally,
many commercially available kits are traditionally unreliable both in their reagents, and in their lot
to-lot stability. Evaluations of these kits have given very mixed results, and are intended for
research use only. Many require that the human sample be pre-diluted before analysis to reduce the
chance of false positives due to the "matrix effect." Thus, there is a clear need for highly sensitive
and accurate diagnostic assays as a companion for FOLR1 -based therapies.
                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 [00071         The present invention provides methods for detection of FOLR1 in a sample and can
be used, for example, to stratify patients.     Thus, in one embodiment, the invention provides a
method of treating a patient having a folate receptor 1-mediated disease comprising: (a) measuring
the shed folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) expression level or FOLR1 on a circulting tumor cell (CTC) in
a sample taken from a patient, relative to a shed or CTC FOLR1 level in a reference sample using
an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that does not competitively inhibit the binding of
the antibody huMov 19 to FOLR1; and (b) administering to the patient a fixed dose of an antibody
or antigen-binding fragment thereof that modulates FOLR1 activity if the patient's shed or CTC
FOLR1 level is elevated; wherein the fixed dose of the antibody or fragment thereof effectively
treats the disease or disorder.
100081          In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating a patient having
a FOLR1-mediated disease or disorder comprising: (a) administering to a patient having a FOLR1
mediated disease or disorder a fixed dose of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that
modulates FOLR1 activity; (b) measuring the patient's shed or CTC FOLR1 expression level
relative to the FOLR1 level in a reference sample using an antibody or antigen binding fragment
thereof that does not competitively inhibit the binding of the antibody huMov19 to FOLR1; and (c)
increasing the amount or frequency of subsequent fixed doses if the patient's shed or CTC FOLR1
level is elevated; wherein an increase (e.g., because increased cell death results in an increased
release of shed FOLR1) or decrease in FOLR1 levels of the patient is indicative of treatment
                                                -2-

efficacy. In another embodiment, the amount or frequency of subsequent fixed doses is increased if
the patient's shed or CTC FOLRI level is decreased.

expression in a patient comprising: (a) measuring the shed or CTC FOLR1 level in a sample taken
from a patient having a FOLRl- mediated disease or disorder, compared to the FOLR1 level in a
reference sample using an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that does not competitively
inhibit the binding of the antibody huMov19 to FOLR1; and (b) administering to the patient a fixed
dose of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that modulates FOLR1 activity if the
patient's shed or CTC FOLR1 level is elevated; wherein the administration of the antibody or
antigen-binding fragment thereof increases (e.g., because increased cell death results in an
increased release of shed FOLRI) or decreases FOLR1 of the patient.
[0010]          In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of decreasing FOLR1
expression in a patient comprising: (a) administering to a patient having a FOLR1 -mediated disease
or disorder a fixed dose of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that modulates FOLR1
activity; (b) measuring the patient's shed or CTC FOLR1 level relative to the FOLR1 level in a
reference sample; and (c) increasing the amount or frequency of subsequent fixed doses if the
patient's shed or CTC FOLR1 level is elevated; wherein the administration of the antibody or
antigen-binding fragment thereof increases (e.g., because increased cell death results in an
increased release of shed FOLR1) or decreases FOLR1 levels in the patient.

the patient a fixed dose of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that modulates FOLR1
activity; (c) measuring a second shed or CTC FOLRl level in a sample taken from the patient
following antibody administration using an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that does
not competitively inhibit the binding of the antibody huMovl9 to FOLR1; and (d) comparing the
second FOLR1 level to the first FOLRl level; wherein an increase (e.g., because increased cell
                                                 -3

                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[00851          The present invention provides a novel method of detecting shed human folate
receptor 1 (FOLR1) or FOLR1 on circulating tumor cells in a patient sample. The FOLR1 can be
detected using antibodies that do not competitively inhibit the binding of an anti-FOLR1 active
agent (e.g., an active agent comprising the antibody huMov19) to FOLR1.       Antibodies that do not
competitively inhibit the binding of an anti-FOLR1 active agent are especially useful in detecting
FOLR1 (e.g., shed FOLR1 or FOLR1 on circulating tumor cells) in samples from patients who
have been treated with the anti-FOLR1 active agent. Shed FOLR1 or FOLR1 on circulating tumor
cells can be used to monitor or determine therapeutic efficacy, or the likelihood of response to the
treatment of cancers characterized by the overexpression of FOLRl.           Novel FOLR1-binding
polypeptides, such as antibodies, that are useful in the shed FOLR1 detection methods as well as
additional FOLR1 detection methods (e.g., IHC for membrane bound and cell associated FOLR1
and CTC assays) are also disclosed.       Related polypeptides and polynucleotides, compositions
comprising the FOLR1-binding agents, and methods of making the FOLR1-binding agents are also
provided. In addition, methods provided herein can be used for patient stratification.
I.      Definitions
 [0086]         To facilitate an understanding of the present invention, a number of terms and
phrases are defined below.
 [0087]         The terms "human folate receptor 1," "FOLR1" or "folate receptor alpha (FR-a)," as
used herein, refer to any native human FOLR1, unless otherwise indicated. Thus, all of these terms
can refer to either a protein or nucleic acid sequence as indicated herein.     The term "FOLR1'"
encompasses "full-length," unprocessed FOLRl as well as any form of FOLR1 that results from
processing within the cell. The term also encompasses naturally occurring variants of FOLR1, e.g.,
                                                - 1A

 splice variants (except those variants that encompass FOLR2, FOLR3, or FOLR4), allelic variants
 and isoforms. The FOLR1 polypeptides described herein can be isolated from a variety of sources,
 such as from human tissue types or from another source, or prepared by recombinant or synthetic
 methods. Examples of FOLR1 sequences include, but are not limited to NCBI reference numbers
 P15328, NP_001092242.1, AAX29268.1, AAX37119.1, NP_057937.1, and NP_057936.1.                     The
 human FOLR1 sequence is a follows:

 [0088]          The terms "shed antigen" and "shed FOLR1" are used interchangeably herein.
These terms refer to a FOLR1 protein that is soluble and that is not cell associated. In some
embodiments it includes the extracellular domain (ECD) and the glycosylphosphatidyl inositol
(GP'    linker. In one embodiment, the shed FOLR1 includes only the ECD. FOLR1 includes a
signal peptide (amino acids 1-24) the FOLR1 protein chain (amino acids 25-233 or 234) and a
propeptide which can be cleaved (amino acids 235 to 257). Shed FOLR can include amino acids 1
to 257, 1 to 233, 1 to 234, 25 to 233, 25 to 234 or any other fragments thereof. In some
embodiments the signal sequence is cleaved. In other embodiments the ECD and the GPI portion
can be embedded in a membrane (e.g., a soluble lipid raft). In one embodiment, the shed FOLR1
can include amino acids 1-233 or a fragment thereof
100891           The term "antibody" means an immunoglobulin molecule that recognizes and
specifically binds to a target, such as a protein, polypeptide, peptide, carbohydrate, polynucleotide,
lipid, or combinations of the foregoing through at least one antigen recognition site within the
variable region of the immunoglobulin molecule. As used herein, the term "antibody" encompasses
intact polyclonal antibodies, intact monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments (such as Fab, Fab',
F(ab')2, and Fv fragments), single chain Fv (scFv) mutants, multispecific antibodies such as
bispecific antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, fusion proteins
comprising     an antigen    determination   portion   of an    antibody, and   any other    modified
immunoglobulin molecule comprising an antigen recognition site so long as the antibodies exhibit
the desired biological activity.      An antibody can be of any of the five major classes of
immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, or subclasses isotopess) thereof (e.g., IgG1, IgG2,
IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2), based on the identity of their heavy-chain constant domains referred
                                                - 17-

to as alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu, respectively. The different classes of immunoglobulins
have different and well known subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations. Antibodies
can be naked or conjugated to other molecules such as toxins, radioisotopes, etc.
[00901          In some embodiments, an antibody is a non-naturally occurring antibody. In some
embodiments, and antibody is purified from natural components.            In some embodiments, an
antibody is recombinant produced.         In some embodiments, an antibody is produced by a
hybridoma.
[0091]          A "blocking" antibody or an "antagonist" antibody is one which inhibits or reduces
biological activity of the antigen it binds, such as FOLR1. In a certain embodiment, blocking
antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the
antigen. Desirably, the biological activity is reduced by 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%,
95%, or even 100%.
[0092]          The term "anti-FOLR1 antibody" or "an antibody that binds to FOLR1" refers to an
antibody that is capable of binding FOLR1 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful
as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic agent in targeting FOLR1. The extent of binding of an anti
FOLR1 antibody to an unrelated, non-FOLR1 protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the
antibody to FOLR1 as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an
antibody that binds to FOLR1 has a dissociation constant (Kd) of <1 piM, <100 nM, 510 nM, 1
nM, or <0.1 nM. In one embodiment, the anti-FOLR1 antibody does not bind FOLR2, FOLR3,
FOLR4, or folic acid.
 [00931         The term "antibody fragment" refers to a portion of an intact antibody and refers to
the antigenic determining variable regions of an intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments
include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments, linear antibodies, single chain
antibodies, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. The term "monoclonal
antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially
homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical
except for possible mutations, e.g., naturally occurring mutations, that may be present in minor
amounts. Thus, the modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as not being a
mixture of discrete antibodies. In certain embodiments, such a monoclonal antibody typically
 includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target, wherein the target
binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that includes the selection of a single
target binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example, the
 selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones, such as a pool of

hybridoma clones, phage clones, or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that a
selected target binding sequence can be further altered, for example, to improve affinity for the
target, to humanize the target binding sequence, to improve its production in cell culture, to reduce
its immunogenicity in vivo, to create a multispecific antibody, etc., and that an antibody comprising
the altered target binding sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to
polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against
different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation
is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. In addition to their specificity, monoclonal
antibody preparations are advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other
immunoglobulins.
[0094]          The modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained
from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring
production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be
used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including,
for example, the hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler and Milstein, Nature, 256:495-97 (1975); Hongo
et al., Hybridoma, 14 (3): 253-260 (1995), Harlow et al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and
T-Cell Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981)), recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S.
Pat. No. 4,816,567), phage-display technologies (see, e.g., Clackson et al., Nature, 352: 624-628

 [00951         The term "humanized antibody" refers to forms of non-human (e.g., murine)
 antibodies that are specific immunoglobulin chains, chimeric immunoglobulins, or fragments
                                               - 10.

thereof that contain minimal non-human (e.g., murine) sequences. Typically, humanized antibodies
are human immunoglobulins in which residues from the complementary determining region (CDR)
are replaced by residues from the CDR of a non-human species (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, hamster)
that have the desired specificity, affinity, and capability (Jones et al., 1986, Nature, 321:522-525;
Riechmann et al., 1988, Nature, 332:323-327; Verhoeyen et al., 1988, Science, 239:1534-1536). In
some instances, the Fv framework region (FR) residues of a human immunoglobulin are replaced
with the corresponding residues in an antibody from a non-human species that has the desired
specificity, affinity, and capability.    The humanized antibody can be further modified by the
substitution of additional residues either in the Fv framework region and/or within the replaced
non-human residues to refine and optimize antibody specificity, affinity, and/or capability. In
general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two or
three, variable domains containing all or substantially all of the CDR regions that correspond to the
non-human immunoglobulin whereas all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human
immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody can also comprise at least a portion
of an immunoglobulin constant region or domain (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.
Examples of methods used to generate humanized antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. 5,225,539
or 5,639,641. "Resurfacing" antibodies generally involves identification of the variable region
framework surface residues in both the light and heavy chains and replacing them with human
equivalents. Methods of resurfacing antibodies have been provided, for example in Roguska et al.,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 91(3):969-973 (1994) and Roguska et al., Protein Eng. 9(10):895-904
(1996), which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.
 [00961         A "variable region" of an antibody refers to the variable region of the antibody light
chain or the variable region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combination. The
variable regions of the heavy and light chain each consist of four framework regions (FR)
connected by three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) also known as hypervariable
regions. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the
 CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies.
 There are at least two techniques for determining CDRs: (1) an approach based on cross-species
 sequence variability (i.e., Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, (5th ed.,
 1991, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Md.)); and (2) an approach based on crystallographic
 studies of antigen-antibody complexes (Al-lazikani et al (1997) J. Molec. Biol. 273:927-948)). In
 addition, combinations of these two approaches are sometimes used in the art to determine CDRs.

 [00971         The Kabat numbering system is generally used when referring to a residue in the
variable domain (approximately residues 1-107 of the light chain and residues 1-113 of the heavy
chain) (eg., Kabat et al, Sequences of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. Public Health Service,
National Institutes of Health., Bethesda, Md. (1991)).
 [00981         The amino acid position numbering as in Kabat, refers to the numbering system used
for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies
in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service,
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991). Using this numbering system, the actual linear
amino acid sequence can contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of,
or insertion into, a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain
can include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of H2 and
inserted residues (e.g., residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy chain FR
residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues can be determined for a given antibody by alignment
at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a "standard" Kabat numbered
sequence. Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops (Chothia and Lesk J. Mol.
Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)). The end of the Chothia CDR-H1 loop when numbered using the Kabat
numbering convention varies between H32 and H34 depending on the length of the loop (this is
because the Kabat numbering scheme places the insertions at H35A and H35B; if neither 35A nor
35B is present, the loop ends at 32; if only 35A is present, the loop ends at 33; if both 35A and 35B
are present, the loop ends at 34). The AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between
the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops, and are used by Oxford Molecular's AbM antibody
modeling software.

{00991          The term "human antibody" means an antibody produced by a human or an antibody
having an amino acid sequence corresponding to an antibody produced by a human made using any
technique known in the art. This definition of a human antibody includes intact or full-length
antibodies, fragments thereof, and/or antibodies comprising at least one human heavy and/or light
chain polypeptide such as, for example, an antibody comprising murine light chain and human
heavy chain polypeptides.
[001001         The term "chimeric antibodies" refers to antibodies wherein the amino acid sequence
of the immunoglobulin molecule is derived from two or more species. Typically, the variable
region of both light and heavy chains corresponds to the variable region of antibodies derived from
one species of mammals (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, etc.) with the desired specificity, affinity, and
capability while the constant regions are homologous to the sequences in antibodies derived from
another (usually human) to avoid eliciting an immune response in that species.
[00101]         The term "epitope" or "antigenic determinant" are used interchangeably herein and
refer to that portion of an antigen capable of being recognized and specifically bound by a
particular antibody.    When the antigen is a polypeptide, epitopes can be formed both from
contiguous amino acids and noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of a protein.
Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids are typically retained upon protein denaturing,
whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding are typically lost upon protein denaturing. An epitope
typically includes at least 3, and more usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino acids in a unique spatial
conformation.
[00102]         "Binding affinity" generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent
interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner
(e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, "binding affinity" refers to intrinsic
binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody
and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the
dissociation constant (Kd). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art,
including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to
dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain
bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art, any of
which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are
described herein.
 [001031        "Or better" when used herein to refer to binding affinity refers to a stronger binding
between a molecule and its binding partner. "Or better" when used herein refers to a stronger
                                                - 22 -

binding, represented by a smaller numerical Kd value. For example, an antibody which has an
affinity for an antigen of "0.6 nM or better," the antibody's affinity for the antigen is <0.6 nM, i.e.,
0.59 nM, 0.58 nM, 0.57 nM etc. or any value less than 0.6 nM. In one embodiment, the antibody's
affinity as determined by a Kd will be between about 10-3 to about 10-        M, between about 10-6 to
about 10~" M, between about 10-6 to about 10-1O M, between about 10-6 to about 10~9 M, between
about 10-6 to about 10~8 M, or between about 10-6 to about 10~7 M.
[00104]         The phrase "substantially similar," or "substantially the same," as used herein,
denotes a sufficiently high degree of similarity between two numeric values (generally one
associated with an antibody of the invention and the other associated with a reference/comparator
antibody) such that one of skill in the art would consider the difference between the two values to
be of little or no biological and/or statistical significance within the context of the biological
characteristics measured by said values (e.g., Kd values). The difference between said two values is
less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, or less than
about 10% as a function of the value for the reference/comparator antibody.
[00105]         A polypeptide, antibody, polynucleotide, vector, cell, or composition which is
"isolated" is a polypeptide, antibody, polynucleotide, vector, cell, or composition which is in a form
not found in nature. Isolated polypeptides, antibodies, polynucleotides, vectors, cells or
compositions include those which have been purified to a degree that they are no longer in a form
in which they are found in nature. In some embodiments, an antibody, polynucleotide, vector, cell,
or composition which is isolated is substantially pure.
[001061          As used herein, "substantially pure" refers to material which is at least 50% pure
(i.e., free from contaminants), at least 90% pure, at least 95% pure, at least 98% pure, or at least
99% pure.
[001071          The term "increased expression" of FOLR1 refers to a sample which contains
elevated levels of FOLR1 expression as compared to a reference sample, a reference FOLR1 level,
or a previous FOLR1 level detected from the same subject. Thus, for example, "increased FOLR1
protein levels" in a patient sample can have FOLR1 protein levels that are higher than the FOLR1
protein levels in a non-cancerous reference sample. "Increased FOLR1 protein levels" in a patient
sample can also, for example, have FOLR1 protein levels that are equal to the FOLR1 protein
levels in a cancerous sample.       In some embodiments, "increased FOLR1 protein levels" are
detected wherein a patient's FOLR1 protein level is at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least
about 15%, at least about 20%, or at least about 25%, at least about 30%, or at least about 50%
more than, for example, a previous FOLR1 level detected from the same subject. In circulating

tumor cell assays, "increased FOLRl protein levels" can refer to samples in which FOLR1 is
detected on a greater percentage of cells or samples in which FOLR1 is detected in higher levels on
the cells. Thus, in some embodiments, "increased FOLR1 protein levels" are detected in CTC
assays where at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, or at
least about 25%, at least about 30%, or at least about 50% more cells show FOLRl expression. In
addition, in some embodiments, "increased FOLRl protein levels" are detected in CTC assays
where at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, or at least about
25%, at least about 30%, or at least about 50% more FOLR1 is detected on cells.
[001081         A "reference sample" can be used to correlate and compare the results obtained in
the methods of the invention from a test sample. Reference samples can be cells (e.g., cell lines,
cell pellets), bodily fluids, or tissue. The FOLR1 levels in the "reference sample" may be an
absolute or relative amount, a range of amount, a minimum and/or maximum amount, a mean
amount, and/or a median amount of FOLR1. A "reference sample" can also serve as a baseline of
FOLR1 expression to which the test sample is compared. The "reference sample" can include a
prior sample or baseline sample from the same patient, a normal reference, or a reference from a
relevant patient population. Generally, FOLR1 levels are expressed as values in a standard curve.
A standard curve is a quantitative method of plotting assay data to determine the concentration of
FOLRl in a sample.        In one embodiment, reference sample is an antigen standard comprising
purified FOLRI or FOLR1-Fc. The diagnostic methods of the invention involve a comparison
between expression levels of FOLR1 in a test sample and a "reference value" or "referece level." In
some embodiments, the reference value is the expression level of the FOLR1 in a reference sample.
A reference value may be a predetermined value and may also be determined from reference
samples (e.g., control biological samples) tested in parallel with the test samples. A reference value
can be a single cut-off value, such as a median or mean or a range of values, such as a confidence
interval.   Reference values can be established for various subgroups of individuals, such as
individuals predisposed to cancer, individuals having early or late stage cancer, male and/or female
individuals, or individuals undergoing cancer therapy. Examples of normal reference samples or
values and positive reference samples or values are described herein.
[00109          The term "primary antibody" herein refers to an antibody that binds specifically to
the target protein antigen in a sample. A primary antibody is generally the first antibody used in an
ELISA assay. In one embodiment, the primary antibody is the only antibody used in an IHC
procedure. The term "secondary antibody" herein refers to an antibody that binds specifically to a
primary antibody, thereby forming a bridge between the primary antibody and a subsequent

 reagent, if any. The secondary antibody is generally the second antibody used in an
 immunohistochemical procedure.
  [00110]         As used herein, "immunohistochemistry" refers to histochemical and immunologic
 methods used to analyze, for example, cells or tissues. Thus, the terms "immunohistochemistry,"
 "immunocytochemistry," and "immunochemistry" are used interchangeably.
 [00111]          A "sample" or "biological sample" of the present invention is of biological origin, in
 specific embodiments, such as from eukaryotic organisms. In preferred embodiments, the sample
 is a human sample, but animal samples may also be used in the practice of the invention. Non
 limiting sources of a sample for use in the present invention include solid tissue, biopsy aspirates,
 ascites, fluidic extracts, blood, plasma, serum, spinal fluid, lymph fluid, the external sections of the
 skin, respiratory, intestinal, and genitourinary tracts, tears, saliva, milk, tumors, organs, cell cultures
 and/or cell culture constituents, for example. The present invention is particularly useful for cancer
 samples which generally comprise bodily fluids such as ascites, where the amount of available
material is small. The method can be used to examine an aspect of expression of FOLR1 or a state
of a sample, including, but not limited to, comparing different types of cells or tissues, comparing
different developmental stages, and detecting or determining the presence and/or type of disease or
abnormality.
 [00112]          As used herein, the term "capture reagent" refers to a reagent capable of binding and
capturing a target molecule in a sample such that under suitable condition, the capture reagent
target molecule complex can be separated from the rest of the sample. In one embodiment, the
capture reagent is immobilized. In one embodiment, the capture reagent in a sandwich
immunoassay is an antibody or a mixture of different antibodies against a target antigen.
[00113]           As used herein, the term "detectable antibody" refers to an antibody that is capable
of being detected either directly through a label amplified by a detection means, or indirectly
through, e.g., another antibody that is labeled. For direct labeling, the antibody is typically
conjugated to a moiety that is detectable by some means. In one embodiment, the detectable
antibody is a biotinylated antibody.
[001141           The word "label" when used herein refers to a detectable compound or composition
which is conjugated directly or indirectly to the antibody so as to generate a "labeled" antibody.
The label can be detectable by itself (e.g., radioisotope labels or fluorescent labels) or, in the case of
an enzymatic label, can catalyze chemical alteration of a substrate compound or composition which
is detectable.
                                                 - 25 -

[00115]         As used herein, the term "detection means" refers to a moiety or technique used to
detect the presence of the detectable antibody in the ELISA herein and includes detection agents
that amplify the immobilized label such as label captured onto a microtiter plate. In one
embodiment, the detection means is a fluorimetric detection agent such as avidin or streptavidin.
[001161         Commonly a "sandwich ELISA" employs the following steps: (1) microtiter plate is
coated with a capture antibody; (2) sample is added, and any antigen present binds to capture
antibody; (3) detecting antibody is added and binds to antigen; (4) enzyme-linked secondary
antibody is added and binds to detecting antibody; and (5) substrate is added and is converted by
enzyme to detectable form.
[00117]         By "correlate" or "correlating" is meant comparing, in any way, the performance
and/or results of a first analysis with the performance and/or results of a second analysis. For
example, one may use the results of a first analysis in carrying out the second analysis and/or one
may use the results of a first analysis to determine whether a second analysis should be performed
and/or one may compare the results of a first analysis with the results of a second analysis. In one
embodiment, increased expression of FOLR1 correlates with increased likelihood of effectiveness
of a FOLR1 -targeting anti-cancer therapy.
[00118]         The terms "cancer" and "cancerous" refer to or describe the physiological condition
in mammals in which a population of cells are characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples
of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia.
More particular examples of such cancers include cancers of endothelial, mesenchymal, or
epithelial origin, such as lung cancer (e.g., squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small
cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, mesothelioma, and squamous carcinoma of the lung),
cancer of the peritoneum (e.g., primary peritoneal), hepatocellular cancer, gastrointestinal cancer,
pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer,
hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial              (e.g., endometrial
adenocarcinoma) or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney cancer, liver cancer,
prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, brain cancer (e.g. glioblastoma,
tumors of the choroid plexus) and various types of head and neck cancers, and also tumors of blood
vessels and fallopian tubes. Cancers also encompass cancers which contain cells having elevated
FOLR1 expression levels. Such FOLRl-elevated cancers include, but are not limited to, ovarian,
non-small cell lung cancer, uterine, endometrial, pancreatic, renal, lung, and breast cancer.

                                                                                  result from excessive cell
1001191           "Tumor" and "neoplasm" refer to any mass of tissue that

growth or proliferation, either benign (noncancerous) or malignant
cancerous lesions.

[001201           The terms "cancer cell," "tumor cell," and grammatical

    "prophylactically effective amount" refers to an amount

 time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically but not necessarily, since a
prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically
 effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.
 [001251         PFS, DFS, and OS can be measured by standards set by the National Cancer
Institute and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the approval of new drugs. See Johnson et
al, (2003) J. Clin. Oncol. 21(7):1404-1411.
 [001261         "Progression free survival" (PFS) refers to the time from enrollment to disease
progression or death. PFS is generally measured using the Kaplan-Meier method and Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (ECIST)        1.1 standards. Generally, progression free survival
refers to the situation wherein a patient remains alive, without the cancer getting worse.
 [001271         "Time to Tumor Progression" (TTP) is defined as the time from enrollment to
disease progression. TTP is generally measured using the RECIST 1.1 criteria.
 [00128]         A "complete response" or "complete remission" or "CR" indicates the disappearance
of all signs of tumor or cancer in response to treatment. This does not always mean the cancer has
been cured.
[00129]          A "partial response" or "PR" refers to a decrease in the size or volume of one or
more tumors or lesions, or in the extent of cancer in the body, in response to treatment.
[00130]          "Stable disease" refers to disease without progression or relapse. In stable disease
there is neither sufficient tumor shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient tumor
increase to qualify as progressive disease.
[001311          "Progressive disease" refers to the appearance of one more new lesions or tumors
and/or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Progressive disease can also
refer to a tumor growth of more than 20 percent since treatment began, either due to an increases in
mass or in spread of the tumor.
[00132]          "Disease free survival" (DFS) refers to the length of time during and after treatment
that the patient remains free of disease.
[00133]          "Overall Survival" (OS) refers to the time from patient enrollment to death or
censored at the date last known alive. OS includes a prolongation in life expectancy as compared
to naive or untreated individuals or patients. Overall survival refers to the situation wherein a
patient remains alive for a defined period of time, such as one year, five years, etc., e.g., from the
time of diagnosis or treatment.
[00134]          A "decrease in CA125 levels" can be assessed according to the Gynecologic Cancer
Intergroup (GCIG) guidelines. For example, CA125 levels can be measured prior to treatment to
                                                -28-

  establish a baseline CA125 level. CA125 levels can be measured one or more times during or after
 treatment, and a reduction in the CA125 levels over time as compared to the baseline level is
 considered a decrease in CA125 levels.
  [00135]        Terms such as "treating" or "treatment" or "to treat" or "alleviating" or "to alleviate"
 refer to both 1) therapeutic measures that cure, slow down, lessen symptoms of, and/or halt
 progression of a diagnosed pathologic condition or disorder and 2) prophylactic or preventative
 measures that prevent and/or slow the development of a targeted pathologic condition or disorder.
 Thus, those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder; those prone to have the
 disorder; and those in whom the disorder is to be prevented. In certain embodiments, a subject is
 successfully "treated" for cancer according to the methods of the present invention if the patient
 shows one or more of the following: reduction in cachexia, increase in survival time, elongation in
 time to tumor progression, reduction in tumor mass, reduction in tumor burden and/or a
 prolongation in time to tumor metastasis, time to tumor recurrence, tumor response, complete
 response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease, progression free survival (PFS),
 overall survival (OS), each as measured by standards set by the National Cancer Institute and the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the approval of new drugs. See Johnson et al, (2003) J.
 Clin. Oncol. 21(7):1404-1411.
 [00136]         "Polynucleotide" or "nucleic acid," as used interchangeably herein, refer to polymers
of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides                          can be
deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any
substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase. A polynucleotide
can comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present,
modification to the nucleotide structure can be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer.
The sequence of nucleotides can be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide
can be further modified after polymerization, such as by conjugation with a labeling component.
Other types of modifications include, for example, "caps," substitution of one or more of the
naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, intemucleotide modifications such as, for example,
those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates,
cabamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.),
those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins,
antibodies, signal peptides, ply-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen,
etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.),
those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.),
                                                - 29-

as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups
ordinarily present in the sugars can be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate
groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to
additional nucleotides, or can be conjugated to solid supports. The 5' and 3' terminal OH can be
phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20
carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls can also be derivatized to standard protecting groups.
Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally
known in the art, including, for example, 2'-O-methyl-, 2'-O-allyl, 2'-fluoro- or 2'-azido-ribose,
carbocyclic sugar analogs, alpha-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or
lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs and abasic nucleoside
analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages can be replaced by
alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to,
embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O)S ("thioate"), P(S)S ("dithioate"), (O)NR 2
("amidate"), P(O)R, P(O)OR', CO or CH 2 ("formacetal"), in which each R or R' is independently H
or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (--0--) linkage, aryl,
alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical.
The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and
DNA.
 [00137]         The term "vector" means a construct, which is capable of delivering, and expressing,
one or more gene(s) or sequence(s) of interest in a host cell. Examples of vectors include, but are
not limited to, viral vectors, naked DNA or RNA expression vectors, plasmid, cosmid or phage
vectors, DNA or RNA expression vectors associated with cationic condensing agents, DNA or
RNA expression vectors encapsulated in liposomes, and certain eukaryotic cells, such as producer
cells.
 [001381         The terms "polypeptide," "peptide," and "protein" are used interchangeably herein to
refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. The polymer can be linear or branched, it can
 comprise modified amino acids, and it can be interrupted by non-amino acids. The terms also
 encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for example,
 disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other
 manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling component. Also included within
 the definition are, for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid
 (including, for example, unnatural amino acids, etc.), as well as other modifications known in the
 art. It is understood that, because the polypeptides of this invention are based upon antibodies, in
                                                 30 -

certain embodiments, the polypeptides can occur as single chains or associated chains. In some
embodiments, a polypeptide, peptide, or protein is non-naturally occurring. In some embodiments,
a polypeptide, peptide, or protein is purified from other naturally occurring components. In some
embodiments, the polypeptide, peptide, or protein is recombinantly produced.
[001391         The terms "identical" or percent "identity" in the context of two or more nucleic
acids or polypeptides, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a
specified percentage of nucleotides or amino acid residues that are the same, when compared and
aligned (introducing gaps, if necessary) for maximum correspondence, not considering any
conservative amino acid substitutions as part of the sequence identity. The percent identity can be
measured using sequence comparison software or algorithms or by visual inspection. Various
algorithms and software are known in the art that can be used to obtain alignments of amino acid or
nucleotide sequences. One such non-limiting example of a sequence alignment algorithm is the
algorithm described in Karlin et al, 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 87:2264-2268, as modified in
Karlin et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad Sci., 90:5873-5877, and incorporated into the NBLAST and
XBLAST programs (Altschul et al., 1991, Nucleic Acids Res., 25:3389-3402). In certain
embodiments, Gapped BLAST can be used as described in Altschul et al., 1997, Nucleic Acids Res.
25:3389-3402. BLAST-2, WU-BLAST-2 (Altschul et al., 1996, Methods in Enzymology, 266:460
480), ALIGN, ALIGN-2 (Genentech, South San Francisco, California) or Megalign (DNASTAR)
are additional publicly available software programs that can be used to align sequences. In certain
embodiments, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the GAP
program in GCG software (e.g., using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60,
70, or 90 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). In certain alternative embodiments, the GAP
program in the GCG software package, which incorporates the algorithm of Needleman and
Wunsch (J, Mol. Biol. (48):444-453 (1970)) can be used to determine the percent identity between
two amino acid sequences (e.g., using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap
weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Alternatively, in certain
embodiments, the percent identity between nucleotide or amino acid sequences is determined using
the algorithm of Myers and Miller (CABIOS, 4:11-17 (1989)). For example, the percent identity
can be determined using the ALIGN program (version 2.0) and using a PAM120 with residue table,
a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. Appropriate parameters for maximal alignment
by particular alignment software can be determined by one skilled in the art.             In certain
embodiments, the default parameters of the alignment software are used. In certain embodiments,
the percentage identity "X" of a first amino acid sequence to a second sequence amino acid is

                                                                                               as identical
calculated as 100 x (Y/Z), where Y is the number of amino acid residues scored
                                                                                                        or a
matches in the alignment of the first and second sequences (as aligned by visual inspection
                                                                              of residues in the second

of the first sequence to the second sequence will be longer than the percent identity of the
sequence to the first sequence.

beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g.,
tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). For example, substitution of a phenylalanine for a
tyrosine is a conservative substitution. In certain embodiments, conservative substitutions in the
sequences of the polypeptides and antibodies of the invention do not abrogate the binding of the
polypeptide or antibody containing the amino acid sequence, to the antigen(s), i.e., the FOLR1 to
which the polypeptide or antibody binds. Methods of identifying nucleotide and amino acid
conservative substitutions which do not eliminate antigen-binding are well- known in the art (see,

  [0105         In some embodiments, an anti-FOLR1 active agent such as IMGN853 modulates
 FOLR1 activity, e.g. decreases the activity of the FOLR1 protein.
  [01061        IMGN853 is currently in clinical development for various therapeutic indications
 which include FOLR1 positive ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, endometrioid cancer,
 renal cancer, and other epithelial malignancies.     Ovarian cancers exhibit the greatest FOLR1
 penetrance and are considered the major indications for treatment with IMGN853 (Antony AC.
 Ann Rev Nutr 16:501-21 (1996); Yuan Y et al. Hum Pathol 40(10):1453-1460 (2009)).
 [01071         Measuring levels of circulating antigen in patient plasma samples (shed antigen)
may help identify patient populations more likely to respond to AMC treatment. High levels of
 shed antigen have been reported to markedly affect the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic antibodies
(Tolcher A. et al. 20th Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics; October 21-24,
2008; Geneva, Switzerland: EORTC-NCI-AACR, p163, #514; Baselga J, et al. J Clin Oncol
 14:737-744 (1996)). It is likely that shed antigen levels from patient plasma samples will be
variable depending on factors such as antigen target, disease indications, and disease course.
Currently shed antigen levels in disease indications for IMGN853 have been insufficiently
examined while correlation with solid tumor expression is limited. While elevation of FOLR1 has
been reported in ovarian adenocarcinomas, data suggests that it is not elevated in other FOLRl+
tumor indications, such as small cell lung carcinoma (Mantovani LT, et al. Eur J Cancer
30A(3):363-9 (1994); Basal E, et al. PLoS ONE 4(7): e6292 (2009)). The present method allows
for detection of the FOLR1 receptor in the presence of high folic acid. Previous assays have used
Mov19 in the design of the assay. Since IMGN853 contains Mov19 and in one embodiment is the
targeted therapy of the invention, it is vital that the method detects FOLR1 in the presence or
absence of Mov19 in embodiments where IMGN853 is administered prior to the detection of
FOLR1. Previous assays that use Movl9 have competitive effects and will detect significantly less
or no FOLRl in patients receiving IMGN853 treatment.
[0108]         In one embodiment, the present method for detecting FOLRl in human sourced fluid
samples uses a traditional sandwich ELISA format (Figure 1). In one embodiment, the method uses
a capture agent (i.e., antibody, other protein) to FOLR1 attached to a solid support.      In one
                                                 34

embodiment, the solid support is a microtiter plate. To this, the sample (ascites fluids, blood,
serum, plasma, etc.) is added without dilution, and is detected by a different detection agent (a
different antibody or protein), which does not interfere with the binding of the first capture agent.
The detection agent is then detected through the use of a secondary detection agent (biotin /
streptavidin, anti-human secondary mono or polyclonal antibody, etc.) which can bind more than
one time to the first detection agent, thus amplifying the signal of detection.        The secondary
detection agent is then quantified by the use of some other means (e.g., TMB/peroxidase,
scintillation counting, fluorescent probes, etc.). Additionally, the assay detects FOLRl and is not
negatively impacted by the presence of Mov19, IMGN853, other FOLR1 family members, or folic
acid.
[01091          The assays of the present invention include assays both to select patients eligible to
receive FOLRI-based therapy and assays to monitor patient response. Assays for response
prediction are run before therapy selection, and levels of shed FOLR1 may impact therapy
decisions. For monitoring patient response, the assay is run at the initiation of therapy to establish
baseline (or predetermined) levels of FOLRl in the sample. The same sample is then assayed and
the levels of FOLR1 compared to the baseline or predetermined levels. As used herein, the term
"predetermined level" refers generally to an assay cutoff value that is used to assess diagnostic
results by comparing the assay results against the predetermined level, and where the
predetermined level already has been linked or associated with various clinical parameters (e.g.,
monitoring whether a subject being treated with a drug has achieved an efficacious blood level of
the drug, monitoring the response of a subject receiving treatment for cancer with an anti-cancer
drug, monitoring the response of a tumor in a subject receiving treatment for said tumor, etc.). The
predetermined level may be either an absolute value or a value normalized by subtracting the value
obtained from a patient prior to the initiation of therapy. An example of a predetermined level that
can be used is a baseline level obtained from one or more subjects that may optionally be suffering
from one or more diseases or conditions. The comparison (or informational analysis) of the level of
the assayed biomarker with the baseline or predetermined level can be done by an automated
system, such as a software program or intelligence system that is part of, or compatible with, the
equipment (e.g., computer platform) on which the assay is carried out. Alternatively, this
comparison or informational analysis can be done by a physician. In one embodiment, where the
levels remain the same or decrease, the therapy may be effective and can be continued. Where
significant increase over baseline level (or predetermined level) occurs, the patient may not be
responding.    In another embodiment, an increase in shed FOLR1 levels may be indicative of
                                                -135 -

 increased cell death and increased release of the shed FOLR1. In this embodiment, an increase in
 shed FOLR1 is indicative of therapeutic efficacy.      Accordingly, in some embodiments, shed
 FOLR1 is measured and cell death is measured. Assays for measuring cell death are known in the
art and include, for example, detection of M30-antigen (caspase-cleaved cytokeratin), markers of
DNA damage such as y-H2AX, or morphological features of cells such as fragmented and/or
condensed DAPI-stained nuclei.
 [0110]         The assays of the present invention can be performed by any protein assay methods.
Protein assay methods useful in the invention are well known in the art and include immunoassay
methods involving binding of a specific unlabeled or labeled antibody or protein to the expressed
protein or fragment of FOLR1. Useful immunoassay methods include both solution phase assays
conducted using any format known in the art, such as, but not limited to, Biacore, time resolved
fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET), an ELISA format, (sandwich, forward and reverse
competitive inhibition) or a fluorescence polarization format, and solid phase assays such as
immunohistochemistry.      The FOLR-1 binding agents provided below are particularly useful for
these immunoassay methods.
III.    FOLR1-binding agents
 [0111]         The present invention provides agents that specifically bind human FOLR1. These
agents are referred to herein as "FOLR1-binding agents."

and tight chain CDR sequences of muFR1-9, muFRl-13, muFR1-53, muFR1-62, and murR1-64.

[01171          Also provided are polypeptides that comprise: (a) a polypeptide having at least about
90% sequence identity to SEQ ID NOs:33-36; and/or (b) a polypeptide having at least about 90%
sequence identity to SEQ ID NOs:37-40.       In certain embodiments, the polypeptide comprises a
polypeptide having at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%,
or at least about 99% sequence identity to SEQ ID NOs:33- 4 0. Thus, in certain embodiments, the
polypeptide comprises (a) a polypeptide having at least about 95% sequence identity to SEQ ID
NOs:33-36, and/or (b) a polypeptide having at least about 95% sequence identity to SEQ ID
NOs:37-40.     In certain embodiments, the polypeptide comprises       (a) a polypeptide having the
amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOs:33-36; and/or (b)           a polypeptide having the amino acid
sequence of SEQ ID NOs:37-40. In certain embodiments, the polypeptide is an antibody and/or the
polypeptide specifically binds FOLR1.      In certain embodiments, the polypeptide is a murine,
chimeric, or humanized antibody that specifically binds FOLR1.          In certain embodiments, the
polypeptide having a certain percentage of sequence identity to SEQ ID NOs:33-40 differs from
SEQ ID NOs:33-40 by conservative amino acid substitutions only.
[0118]          The affinity or avidity of an antibody        for an antigen can be determined
experimentally using any suitable method well known in the art, e.g., cytometry (including flow
cytometry), enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), or radioimmunoassay (RIA), or
kinetics (e.g., surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (BIACORE TM ) analysis). Direct binding
assays as well as competitive binding assay formats can be readily employed. (See, for example,
Berzofsky, et al., "Antibody-Antigen Interactions," In Fundamental Immunology, Paul, W. E., Ed.,
Raven Press: New York, N.Y. (1984); Kuby, Janis Immunology, W. H. Freeman and Company:
New York, N.Y. (1992); and methods described herein.          The measured affinity of a particular
antibody-antigen    interaction  can vary if measured       under different    conditions  (e.g., salt
concentration, pH, temperature). Thus, measurements of affinity and other antigen-binding
parameters (e.g., KD or Kd, Kon, KIr) are made with standardized solutions of antibody and
antigen, and a standardized buffer, as known in the art and such as the buffer described herein.
[0119]          In one aspect, binding assays can be performed using cytometry (e.g., flow
cytometry) on cells expressing the FOLR1 antigen on the surface. For example, FOLRl-positve
cells such as SKOV3 were incubated with varying concentrations of anti-FOLR1 antibodies using 1
x10
    5
      cells per sample in 100 ptL FACS buffer (RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 2% normal
                                                Al1

 goat serum). Then, the cells were pelleted, washed, and incubated for 1 h with 100 piL of FITC
 conjugated goat-anti-mouse or goat-anti-human IgG-antibody (such as is obtainable from, for
 example Jackson Laboratory, 6 pig/mL in FACS buffer). The cells were pelleted again, washed
 with FACS buffer and resuspended in 200 [tL of PBS containing 1%formaldehyde. Samples were
 acquired, for example, using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with the HTS multiwell sampler and
 analyzed using CellQuest Pro (all from BD Biosciences, San Diego, US). For each sample the
 mean fluorescence intensity for FL1 (MFI) was exported and plotted against the antibody
 concentration in a semi-log plot to generate a binding curve. A sigmoidal dose-response curve is
 fitted for binding curves and EC50 values are calculated using programs such as GraphPad Prism
 v4 with default parameters (GraphPad software, San Diego, CA). EC50 values can be used as a
measure for the apparent dissociation constant "Kd" or "KD" for each antibody.
 [0120]          Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using hybridoma methods, such as those
described by Kohler and Milstein (1975) Nature 256:495. Using the hybridoma method, a mouse,
hamster, or other appropriate host animal, is immunized as described above to elicit the production
by lymphocytes of antibodies that will specifically bind to an immunizing antigen. Lymphocytes
can also be immunized in vitro. Following immunization, the lymphocytes are isolated and fused
with a suitable myeloma cell line using, for example, polyethylene glycol, to form hybridoma cells
that can then be selected away from unfused lymphocytes and myeloma cells. Hybridomas that
produce monoclonal antibodies directed specifically against a chosen antigen as determined by
immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, or by an in vitro binding assay (e.g., radioimmunoassay
(RIA); enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) can then be propagated either in vitro
culture using standard methods (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice,
Academic Press, 1986) or in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal. The monoclonal antibodies can
then be purified from the culture medium or ascites fluid as described for polyclonal antibodies.
101211           Alternatively monoclonal antibodies can also be made using recombinant DNA
methods as described in U.S. Patent 4,816,567.         The polynucleotides encoding a monoclonal
antibody are isolated from mature B-cells or hybridoma cells, such as by RT-PCR using
oligonucleotide primers that specifically amplify the genes encoding the heavy and light chains of
the antibody, and their sequence is determined using conventional procedures.           The isolated
polynucleotides encoding the heavy and light chains are then cloned into suitable expression
vectors, which when transfected into host cells such as E. coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin
protein, monoclonal antibodies are generated by the host cells. Also, recombinant monoclonal
                                               - A~) -

antibodies or fragments thereof of the desired species can be isolated from phage display libraries
expressing CDRs of the desired species as described (McCafferty et al., 1990, Nature, 348:552-554;
Clackson et al., 1991, Nature, 352:624-628; and Marks et al., 1991, J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597).
 [01221          The polynucleotide(s) encoding a monoclonal antibody can further be modified in a
number of different manners using recombinant DNA technology to generate alternative antibodies.
In some embodiments, the constant domains of the light and heavy chains of, for example, a mouse
monoclonal antibody can be substituted 1) for those regions of, for example, a human antibody to
generate a chimeric antibody or 2) for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide to generate a fusion
antibody. In some embodiments, the constant regions are truncated or removed to generate the
desired antibody fragment of a monoclonal antibody. Site-directed or high-density mutagenesis of
the variable region can be used to optimize specificity, affinity, etc. of a monoclonal antibody.
[01231          In some embodiments, the monoclonal antibody against the human FOLR1 is a
humanized antibody. In certain embodiments, such antibodies are used therapeutically to reduce
antigenicity and HAMA (human anti-mouse antibody) responses when administered to a human
subject.
[01241          Methods for engineering, humanizing or resurfacing non-human or human
antibodies can also be used and are well known in the art. A humanized, resurfaced or similarly
engineered antibody can have one or more amino acid residues from a source that is non-human,
e.g., but not limited to, mouse, rat, rabbit, non-human primate or other mammal. These non-human
amino acid residues are replaced by residues that are often referred to as "import" residues, which
are typically taken from an "import" variable, constant or other domain of a known human
sequence.
[0125]           Such imported sequences can be used to reduce immunogenicity or reduce, enhance
or modify binding, affinity, on-rate, off-rate, avidity, specificity, half-life, or any other suitable
characteristic, as known in the art. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially
involved in influencing FOLR1 binding. Accordingly, part or all of the non-human or human CDR
sequences are maintained while the non-human sequences of the variable and constant regions can
be replaced with human or other amino acids.
[0126]          Antibodies can also optionally be humanized, resurfaced, engineered or human
antibodies engineered with retention of high affinity for the antigen FOLR1 and other favorable
biological properties. To achieve this goal, humanized (or human) or engineered anti-FOLR1
antibodies and resurfaced antibodies can be optionally prepared by a process of analysis of the
parental sequences and various conceptual humanized and engineered products using three-

  dimensional models of the parental, engineered, and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional
  immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art.
  Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional
  conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these
  displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate
  immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate
  immunoglobulin to bind its antigen, such as FOLR1. In this way, framework (FR) residues can be
  selected and combined from the consensus and import sequences so that the desired antibody
  characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved.
  [01271           Humanization, resurfacing or engineering of antibodies of the present invention can
 be performed using any known method, such as but not limited to those described in, Winter (Jones

 [01281           In certain alternative embodiments, the antibody to FOLR1 is a human antibody.
Human antibodies can be directly prepared using various techniques known in the art.
Immortalized human B lymphocytes immunized in vitro or isolated from an immunized individual
that produce an antibody directed against a target antigen can be generated (See, e.g., Cole et al.,
Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985); Boemer et al., 1991, J.
Immunol., 147 (1):86-95; and U.S. Patent 5,750,373). Also, the human antibody can be selected
from a phage library, where that phage library expresses human antibodies, as described, for
example, in Vaughan et al., 1996, Nat. Biotech., 14:309-314, Sheets et al., 1998, Proc. Nat'l. Acad.
Sci., 95:6157-6162, Hoogenboom and Winter, 1991, J. Mol. Biol., 227:381, and Marks et al., 1991,
J. Mol. Biol., 222:581). Techniques for the generation and use of antibody phage libraries are also
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,969,108, 6,172,197, 5,885,793, 6,521,404; 6,544,731; 6,555,313;

 Mol. Bio., doi:10.1016/j.jmb.2007.12.018 (each of which is incorporated by reference in its
 entirety).   Affinity maturation strategies and chain shuffling strategies (Marks et al., 1992,
 Bio/Technology 10-779-783, incorporated by reference in its entirety) are known in the art and can
 be employed to generate high affinity human antibodies.
 [01291          Humanized antibodies can also be made in transgenic mice containing hunan
 immunoglobulin loci that are capable upon immunization of producing the full repertoire of human
 antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. This approach is described
 in U.S. Patents 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633 ,425; and 5,661,016,
 [0130]         This invention also encompasses bispecific antibodies that specifically recognize a
 human folate receptor 1. Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that are capable of specifically
 recognizing and binding at least two different epitopes. The different epitopes can either be within
 the same molecule (e.g., the same human folate receptor 1) or on different molecules, for example,
the antibodies can specifically recognize and bind a human folate receptor 1 as                     for
 example, 1) an effector molecule on a leukocyte such as a T-cell receptor (e.g, CD3) or Fe receptor
 (e.g., CD64. CD32, or CD16) or 2) a cytotoxic agent as described in detail below.
 [0131]         Exemplary bispecific antibodies cain bind to two different epitopes, at least one of
which originates in a polypeptide of the invention.       Alternatively, an anti-antigenic arm of an
immunoglobulin molecule can be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a
 leukocyte such as a T cell receptor molecule (e.g., CD2, CD3, CD28 or B7), or Fe receptors for
IgG so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the cell expressing the particular antigen.
Bispecific antibodies can also be used to direct cytotoxic agents to cells which express a particular
antigen. These antibodies possess an antigen-binding arm and an arm which binds a cytotoxic
agent or a radionuclide chelator, such as EOTUBE, DPTA, DOTA, or TETA.                 Techniques for
making bispecific antibodies are common in the art (Millstein et al., 1983, Nature 305:537-539;

U.S. Patent 5,731,168).     Antibodies with more than two valencies are also contemplated.         For
example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared (Tutt et al., J. Immunol. 147:60 (1991)).      Thus, in
certain embodiments the antibodies to FOLR1 are multispecific.
[0132]          In certain embodiments are provided an antibody fragment to, for example, increase
tumor penetration.     Various techniques are known for the production of antibody fragments.
Traditionally, these fragments are derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies (for example

Morimoto et al., 1993, Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24:107-117; Brennan et
al.,  1985, Science, 229:81).        In certain embodiments, antibody fragments are produced
recombinantly. Fab, Fv, and scFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from E.
coli or other host cells, thus allowing the production of large amounts of these fragments. Such
antibody fragments can also be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. The
antibody fragment can also be linear antibodies as described in U.S. Patent 5,641,870, for example,
and can be monospecific or bispecific. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments
will be apparent to the skilled practitioner.
[0133]          According to the present invention, techniques can be adapted for the production of
single-chain antibodies specific to human folate receptor 1 (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778). In
addition, methods can be adapted for the construction of Fab expression libraries (Huse, et al.,
Science 246:1275-1281 (1989)) to allow rapid and effective identification of monoclonal Fab
fragments with the desired specificity for a folate 1 receptor, or derivatives, fragments, analogs or
homologs thereof, Antibody fragments can be produced by techniques in the art including, but not
limited to: (a) a F(ab')2 fragment produced by pepsin digestion of an antibody molecule; (b) a Fab
fragment generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of an F(ab')2 fragment, (c) a Fab fragment
generated by the treatment of the antibody molecule with papain and a reducing agent, and (d) Fv
fragments.
[0134]          It can further be desirable, especially in the case of antibody fragments, to modify an
antibody in order to increase its serum half-life. This can be achieved, for example, by
incorporation of a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody fragment by mutation of the
appropriate region in the antibody fragment or by incorporating the epitope into a peptide tag that is
then fused to the antibody fragment at either end or in the middle (e.g., by DNA or peptide
synthesis).
[0135]          Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention.
Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies.           Such antibodies
have, for example, been proposed to target immune cells to unwanted cells (U.S. Pat. No.
4,676,980). It is contemplated that the antibodies can be prepared in vitro using known methods in
synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents.              For example,
immunotoxins can be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether
bond.    Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl-4
mercaptobutyrimidate.

 [0136]         For the purposes of the present invention, it should be appreciated that modified
 antibodies can comprise any type of variable region that provides for the association of the antibody
 with the polypeptides of a human FOLRl. In this regard, the variable region can comprise or be
 derived from any type of mammal that can be induced to mount a humoral response and generate
 immunoglobulins against the desired tumor associated antigen. As such, the variable region of the
 modified antibodies can be, for example, of human, murine, non-human primate (e.g., cynomolgus
 monkeys, macaques, etc.) or lupine origin. In some embodiments both the variable and constant
 regions of the modified immunoglobulins are human. In other embodiments the variable regions of
 compatible antibodies (usually derived from a non-human source) can be engineered or specifically
tailored to improve the binding properties or reduce the immunogenicity of the molecule. In this
respect, variable regions useful in the present invention can be humanized or otherwise altered
through the inclusion of imported amino acid sequences.
 [01371         In certain embodiments, the variable domains in both the heavy and light chains are
altered by at least partial replacement of one or more CDRs and, if necessary, by partial framework
region replacement and sequence changing. Although the CDRs can be derived from an antibody
of the same class or even subclass as the antibody from which the framework regions are derived, it
is envisaged that the CDRs will be derived from an antibody of different class and in certain
embodiments from an antibody from a different species. It may not be necessary to replace all of
the CDRs with the complete CDRs from the donor variable region to transfer the antigen-binding
capacity of one variable domain to another. Rather, it may only be necessary to transfer those
residues that are necessary to maintain the activity of the antigen-binding site. Given the
explanations set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,585,089, 5,693,761 and 5,693,762, it will be well within
the competence of those skilled in the art, either by carrying out routine experimentation or by trial
and error testing to obtain a functional antibody with reduced immunogenicity.
[0138]          Alterations to the variable region notwithstanding, those skilled in the art will
appreciate that the modified antibodies of this invention will comprise antibodies (e.g., full-length
antibodies or immunoreactive fragments thereof) in which at least a fraction of one or more of the
constant region domains has been deleted or otherwise altered so as to provide desired biochemical
characteristics such as increased tumor localization or reduced serum half-life when compared with
an antibody of approximately the same immunogenicity comprising a native or unaltered constant
region.   In some embodiments, the constant region of the modified antibodies will comprise a
human constant region.        Modifications to the constant region compatible with this invention
comprise additions, deletions or substitutions of one or more amino acids in one or more domains.
                                                 A '7

 That is, the modified antibodies disclosed herein can comprise alterations or modifications to one or
more of the three heavy chain constant domains (CHI, CH2 or CH3) and/or to the light chain
 constant domain (CL). In some embodiments, modified constant regions wherein one or more
domains are partially or entirely deleted are contemplated. In some embodiments, the modified
antibodies will comprise domain deleted constructs or variants wherein the entire CH2 domain has
been removed (ACH2 constructs). In some embodiments, the omitted constant region domain will
be replaced by a short amino acid spacer (e.g., 10 residues) that provides some of the molecular
flexibility typically imparted by the absent constant region.
 [0139]          It will be noted that in certain embodiments, the modified antibodies can be
engineered to fuse the CH3 domain directly to the hinge region of the respective modified
antibodies. In other constructs it may be desirable to provide a peptide spacer between the hinge
region and the modified CH2 and/or CH3 domains. For example, compatible constructs could be
expressed wherein the CH2 domain has been deleted and the remaining CH3 domain (modified or
unmodified) is joined to the hinge region with a 5-20 amino acid spacer. Such a spacer can be
added, for instance, to ensure that the regulatory elements of the constant domain remain free and
accessible or that the hinge region remains flexible. However, it should be noted that amino acid
spacers can, in some cases, prove to be immunogenic and elicit an unwanted immune response
against the construct. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, any spacer added to the construct will
be relatively non-immunogenic, or even omitted altogether, so as to maintain the desired
biochemical qualities of the modified antibodies.
[0140]           Besides the deletion of whole constant region domains, it will be appreciated that the
antibodies of the present invention can be provided by the partial deletion or substitution of a few
or even a single amino acid. For example, the mutation of a single amino acid in selected areas of
the CH2 domain may be enough to substantially reduce Fe binding and thereby increase tumor
localization. Similarly, it may be desirable to simply delete that part of one or more constant region
domains that control the effector function (e.g., complement ClQ binding) to be modulated. Such
partial deletions of the constant regions can improve selected characteristics of the antibody (serum
half-life) while leaving other desirable functions associated with the subject constant region domain
intact. Moreover, as alluded to above, the constant regions of the disclosed antibodies can be
modified through the mutation or substitution of one or more amino acids that enhances the profile
of the resulting construct. In this respect it may be possible to disrupt the activity provided by a
conserved binding site (e.g., Fc binding) while substantially maintaining the configuration and
imniunagenic profile of the modified antibody.      ertain embodiments ca comprise the addition of

 one or more amino acids to the constant region to enhance desirable characteristics such as
 decreasing or increasing effector function or provide for more cytotoxin or carbohydrate
 attachment.    In such embodiments it can be desirable to insert or replicate specific sequences
 derived from selected constant region domains.
 [0141]          The present invention further embraces variants and equivalents which are
 substantially homologous to the chimeric, humanized and human antibodies, or antibody fragments
 thereof, set forth herein. These can contain, for example, conservative substitution mutations, i.e.,
 the substitution of one or more amino acids by similar amino acids. For example, conservative
 substitution refers to the substitution of an amino acid with another within the same general class
 such as, for example, one acidic amino acid with another acidic amino acid, one basic amino acid
with another basic amino acid or one neutral amino acid by another neutral amino acid. What is
 intended by a conservative amino acid substitution is well known in the art.
 [0142]          The polypeptides of the present invention can be recombinant polypeptides, natural
polypeptides, or synthetic polypeptides comprising an antibody, or fragment thereof, against a
human FOLR1. It will be recognized in the art that some amino acid sequences of the invention
can be varied without significant effect of the structure or function of the protein.      Thus, the
invention further includes variations of the polypeptides which show substantial activity or which
include regions of an antibody, or fragment thereof, against a human folate receptor protein. Such
mutants include deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and type substitutions.
 [0143]          The polypeptides and analogs can be further modified to contain additional chemical
moieties not normally part of the protein. Those derivatized moieties can improve the solubility, the
biological half life or absorption of the protein. The moieties can also reduce or eliminate any
desirable side effects of the proteins and the like. An overview for those moieties can be found in
REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, 20th ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA
(2000).
 [0144]          The isolated polypeptides described herein can be produced by any suitable method
known in the art. Such methods range from direct protein synthetic methods to constructing a DNA
sequence encoding isolated polypeptide sequences and expressing those sequences in a suitable
transformed host.      In some embodiments, a DNA sequence is constructed using recombinant
technology by isolating or synthesizing a DNA sequence encoding a wild-type protein of interest.
Optionally, the sequence can be mutagenized by site-specific mutagenesis to provide functional
analogs thereof. See, e.g., Zoeller et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 81:5662-5066 (1984) and U.S.
Pat. No. 4,588,585.
                                                   A I

 [01451         In some embodiments a DNA sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest would be
constructed by chemical synthesis using an oligonucleotide synthesizer. Such oligonucleotides can
be designed based on the amino acid sequence of the desired polypeptide and selecting those
codons that are favored in the host cell in which the recombinant polypeptide of interest will be
produced.    Standard methods can be applied to synthesize an isolated polynucleotide sequence
encoding an isolated polypeptide of interest. For example, a complete amino acid sequence can be
used to construct a back-translated gene.       Further, a DNA oligomer containing a nucleotide
sequence coding for the particular isolated polypeptide can be synthesized. For example, several
small oligonucleotides coding for portions of the desired polypeptide can be synthesized and then
ligated. The individual oligonucleotides typically contain 5' or 3' overhangs for complementary
assembly.
[01461          Once assembled (by synthesis, site-directed mutagenesis or another method), the
polynucleotide sequences encoding a particular isolated polypeptide of interest will be inserted into
an expression vector and operatively linked to an expression control sequence appropriate for
expression of the protein in a desired host. Proper assembly can be confirmed by nucleotide
sequencing, restriction mapping, and expression of a biologically active polypeptide in a suitable
host. As is well known in the art, in order to obtain high expression levels of a transfected gene in a
host, the gene must be operatively linked to transcriptional and translational expression control
sequences that are functional in the chosen expression host.
[01471          In certain embodiments, recombinant expression vectors are used to amplify and
express DNA encoding antibodies, or fragments thereof, against human FOLR1.               Recombinant
expression vectors are replicable DNA constructs which have synthetic or cDNA-derived DNA
fragments encoding a polypeptide chain of an anti-FOLR1 antibody, or fragment thereof,
operatively linked to suitable transcriptional or translational regulatory elements derived from
mammalian, microbial, viral or insect genes.         A transcriptional unit generally comprises an
assembly of (1) a genetic element or elements having a regulatory role in gene expression, for
example, transcriptional promoters or enhancers, (2) a structural or coding sequence which is
transcribed into mRNA and translated into protein, and (3) appropriate transcription and translation
initiation and termination sequences, as described in detail below. Such regulatory elements can
include an operator sequence to control transcription. The ability to replicate in a host, usually
conferred by an origin of replication, and a selection gene to facilitate recognition of transformants
can additionally be incorporated. DNA regions are operatively linked when they are functionally
related to each other. For example, DNA for a signal peptide (secretory leader) is operatively

 linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a precursor which participates in the secretion
of the polypeptide; a promoter is operatively linked to a coding sequence if it controls the
transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operatively linked to a coding sequence
if it is positioned so as to permit translation.      Structural elements intended for use in yeast
expression systems include a leader sequence enabling extracellular secretion of translated protein
by a host cell. Alternatively, where recombinant protein is expressed without a leader or transport
sequence, it can include an N-terminal methionine residue.           This residue can optionally be
subsequently cleaved from the expressed recombinant protein to provide a final product.
 [0148]         The choice of expression control sequence and expression vector will depend upon
the choice of host. A wide variety of expression host/vector combinations can be employed.
Useful expression vectors for eukaryotic hosts, include, for example, vectors comprising expression
control sequences from SV40, bovine papilloma virus, adenovirus and cytomegalovirus. Useful
expression vectors for bacterial hosts include known bacterial plasmids, such as plasmids from
Escherichia coli, including pCR 1, pBR322, pMB9 and their derivatives, wider host range
plasmids, such as M13 and filamentous single-stranded DNA phages.
 [01491         Suitable host cells for expression of a FOLR1-binding polypeptide or antibody (or a
FOLR1 protein to use as an antigen) include prokaryotes, yeast, insect or higher eukaryotic cells
under the control of appropriate promoters. Prokaryotes include gram negative or gram positive
organisms, for example E. coli or bacilli. Higher eukaryotic cells include established cell lines of
mammalian origin as described below.         Cell-free translation systems could also be employed.
Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with bacterial, fungal, yeast, and mammalian
cellular hosts are described by Pouwels et al. (Cloning Vectors: A Laboratory Manual, Elsevier,
N.Y., 1985), the relevant disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.         Additional
information regarding methods of protein production, including antibody production, can be found,
e.g., in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0187954, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,413,746 and 6,660,501, and
International Patent Publication No. WO 04009823, each of which is hereby incorporated by
reference herein in its entirety.
[0150]          Various mammalian or insect cell culture systems are also advantageously employed
to express recombinant protein. Expression of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells can be
performed because such proteins are generally correctly folded, appropriately modified and
completely functional.     Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include HEK-293 and
HEK-293T, the COS-7 lines of monkey kidney cells, described by Gluzman (Cell 23:175, 1981),
and other cell lines including, for example, L cells, C127, 3T3, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO),
                                                - 51

HeLa and BHK cell lines. Mammalian expression vectors can comprise nontranscribed elements
such as an origin of replication, a suitable promoter and enhancer linked to the gene to be
expressed, and other 5' or 3' flanking nontranscribed sequences, and 5' or 3' nontranslated
sequences, such as necessary ribosome binding sites, a polyadenylation site, splice donor and
acceptor sites, and transcriptional termination sequences. Baculovirus systems for production of
heterologous proteins in insect cells are reviewed by Luckow and Summers, Bio/Technology 6:47
(1988).
[0151]           The proteins produced by a transformed host can be purified according to any
suitable method. Such standard methods include chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity and
sizing column chromatography), centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard
technique for protein purification. Affinity tags such as hexahistidine, maltose binding domain,
influenza coat sequence and glutathione-S-transferase can be attached to the protein to allow easy
purification by passage over an appropriate affinity column.          Isolated proteins can also be
physically characterized using such techniques as proteolysis, nuclear magnetic resonance and x
ray crystallography.
 [0152]          For example, supernatants from systems which secrete recombinant protein into
culture media can be first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter,
for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. Following the concentration step,
the concentrate can be applied to a suitable purification matrix. Alternatively, an anion exchange
resin can be employed, for example, a matrix or substrate having pendant diethylaminoethyl
(DEAE) groups.        The matrices can be acrylamide, agarose, dextran, cellulose or other types
commonly employed in protein purification. Alternatively, a cation exchange step can be
employed. Suitable cation exchangers include various insoluble matrices comprising sulfopropyl
or carboxymethyl groups.          Finally, one or more reversed-phase high performance liquid
 chromatography (RP-HPLC) steps employing hydrophobic RP-HPLC media, e.g., silica gel having
pendant methyl or other aliphatic groups, can be employed to further purify a FOLR1-binding
 agent. Some or all of the foregoing purification steps, in various combinations, can also be
 employed to provide a homogeneous recombinant protein.
 [0153]           Recombinant protein produced in bacterial culture can be isolated, for example, by
 initial extraction from cell pellets, followed by one or more concentration, salting-out, aqueous ion
 exchange or size exclusion chromatography steps. High performance liquid chromatography
 (HPLC) can be employed for final purification steps. Microbial cells employed in expression of a

 recombinant protein can be disrupted by any convenient method, including freeze-thaw cycling,
 sonication, mechanical disruption, or use of cell lysing agents.
 [0154]         Methods known in the art for purifying antibodies and other proteins also include,
 for example, those described in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2008/0312425, 2008/0177048, and
 2009/0187005, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
 IV.     Polynucleotides
 [01551         In certain embodiments, the invention encompasses polynucleotides comprising
polynucleotides that encode a polypeptide that specifically binds a human FOLR1 receptor or a
fragment of such a polypeptide. For example, the invention provides a polynucleotide comprising a
nucleic acid sequence that encodes an antibody to a human FOLR1 or encodes a fragment of such
an antibody. The polynucleotides of the invention can be in the form of RNA or in the form of
DNA. DNA includes cDNA, genomic DNA, and synthetic DNA; and can be double-stranded or
single-stranded, and if single stranded can be the coding strand or non-coding (anti-sense) strand.
In some embodiments, the polynucleotide is a cDNA or a DNA lacking one more endogenous
introns.
 [0156]         In some embodiments, a polynucleotide is a non-naturally occurring polynucleotide.
In some embodiments, a polynucleotide is recombinantly produced.
 [0157]         In certain embodiments, the polynucleotides are isolated. In certain embodiments,
the polynucleotides are substantially pure.      In some embodiments, a polynucleotide is purified
from natural components.
 [0158]         The invention provides a polynucleotide comprising a polynucleotide encoding a
polypeptide comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1-40. Also
provided is a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide having at least about 95%, at least about 96%,
at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99% sequence identity to SEQ ID NOs: 1
40.
 [0159]         In certain embodiments the polynucleotides comprise the coding sequence for the
mature polypeptide fused in the same reading frame to a polynucleotide which aids, for example, in
expression and secretion of a polypeptide from a host cell (e.g., a leader sequence which functions
as a secretory sequence for controlling transport of a polypeptide from the cell). The polypeptide
having a leader sequence is a preprotein and can have the leader sequence cleaved by the host cell
to form the mature form of the polypeptide. The polynucleotides can also encode for a proprotein
which is the mature protein plus additional 5' amino acid residues. A mature protein having a

prosequence is a proprotein and is an inactive form of the protein. Once the prosequence is cleaved
an active mature protein remains.
 [0160]          In certain embodiments the polynucleotides comprise the coding sequence for the
mature polypeptide fused in the same reading frame to a marker sequence that allows, for example,
for purification of the encoded polypeptide.      For example, the marker sequence can be a hexa
histidine tag supplied by a pQE-9 vector to provide for purification of the mature polypeptide fused
to the marker in the case of a bacterial host, or the marker sequence can be a hemagglutinin (HA)
tag derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein when a mammalian host (e.g., COS-7 cells) is
used.
[01611           The present invention further relates to variants of the hereinabove described
polynucleotides encoding, for example, fragments, analogs, and derivatives.
[01621           The polynucleotide variants can contain alterations in the coding regions, non
coding regions, or both.      In some embodiments the polynucleotide variants contain alterations
which produce silent substitutions, additions, or deletions, but do not alter the properties or
activities of the encoded polypeptide. In some embodiments, nucleotide variants are produced by
silent substitutions due to the degeneracy of the genetic code.        Polynucleotide variants can be
produced for a variety of reasons, e.g., to optimize codon expression for a particular host (change
codons in the human mRNA to those preferred by a bacterial host such as E. coli).
[0163]           Vectors and cells comprising the polynucleotides described herein are also provided.
V.       Detection
[0164]           When a sandwich ELISA format is used, the capture antibody will be unlabeled.
The detection antibody will be either directly labeled, or detected indirectly by addition (after
washing off excess detection antibody) of a molar excess of a second, labeled antibody directed
against the first antibody.
[0165]           The label used for the detection antibody is any detectable functionality that does not
interfere with the binding of the FOLR1 antibodies. Examples of suitable labels are those numerous
labels known for use in immunoassay, including moieties that may be detected directly, such as
fluorochrome, chemiluminescent, and radioactive labels, as well as moieties, such as enzymes, that
                                                                                                    32
must be reacted or derivatized to be detected. Examples of such labels include the radioisotopes       P,
 1C,     I, 3H, and  1I,  fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives,
rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, umbelliferone, luciferases, e.g., firefly luciferase and
bacterial luciferase (U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, horseradish

peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase,       p-galactosidase,  glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide
oxidases, e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase,
heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase, coupled with an enzyme that employs
hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HRP, lactoperoxidase, or microperoxidase,
biotin/avidin, biotin/streptavidin, biotin/Streptavidin-p-galactosidase with MUG, spin labels,
bacteriophage labels, stable free radicals, and the like. As noted above, the fluorimetric detection is
one example.
[0166]          Conventional methods are available to bind these labels covalently to proteins or
polypeptides. For instance, coupling agents such as dialdehydes, carbodiimides, dimaleimides, bis
imidates, bis-diazotized benzidine, and the like may be used to tag the antibodies with the above
described fluorescent, chemiluminescent, and enzyme labels. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos.
3,940,475 (fluorimetry) and 3,645,090 (enzymes); Hunter et al. Nature 144:945 (1962); David et al.
Biochemistry 13:1014-1021 (1974); Pain et al. J. Immunol. Methods 40:219-230 (1981); and
Nygren J. Histochem. and Cytochem. 30:407-412 (1982). In certain embodiments, labels herein are
fluorescent to increase amplification and sensitivity to 8 pg/ml, more preferably biotin with
streptavidin- P-galactosidase and MUG for amplifying the signal. In certain embodiments, a
colorimetric label is used, e.g., where the detectable antibody is biotinylated and the detection
means is avidin or streptavidin-peroxidase and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethyl benzidine.
[01671          The conjugation of such label, including the enzymes, to the antibody is a standard
manipulative procedure for one of ordinary skill in immunoassay techniques. See, for example,
O'Sullivan et al. "Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme-antibody Conjugates for Use in Enzyme
Immunoassay," in Methods in Enzymology, ed. J. J. Langone and H. Van Vunakis, Vol. 73
(Academic Press, New York, N.Y., 1981), pp. 147-166.
[0168]          Following the addition of last labeled antibody, the amount of bound antibody is
determined by removing excess unbound labeled antibody through washing and then measuring the
amount of the attached label using a detection method appropriate to the label, and correlating the
measured amount with the amount of shed FOLR1 or FOLRl on circulating tumor cells in the
biological sample. For example, in the case of enzymes, the amount of color developed and
measured will be a direct measurement of the amount of shed FOLR1 present or FOLR1 present on
circulating tumor cells. Specifically, if HRP is the label, the color can be detected using the
substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethyl benzidine at 450 nm absorbance.
        VI. Circulating Tumor Cell Assays

[01691          The anti-FOLR1 antibodies described herein may also be used for the detection of
FOLR1 in a circulating tumor cell assay. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cells that have shed
into the vasculature from a tumor and circulate in the bloodstream. CTCs are present in circulation
in extremely low concentrations. In general, CTC are enriched from patient blood or plasma by
various techniques known in the art. CTCs may be stained for specific markers using methods
known in the art including, but not limited to, cytometry (e.g., flow cytometry)-based methods and
IHC-based methods. CTCs may be stained for protein markers unique to the tumor cells which
allows for the identification and distinction of CTCs from normal blood cells. CTCs may also be
stained for FOLR1 using the antibodies of the invention including, but not limited to, FR1-9 and
FR1-13. CTC analysis may also include quantitative analysis of the number of CTCs and/or the
number of FOLR1 positive CTCs. In the present invention, the FOLR1 antibodies described herein
may be used to stain the CTCs isolated from a subject having a cancer to measure the FOLRl
present in the CTCs. An increase in FOLR1 expressing CTCs may help identify the subject as
having a cancer that is likely to respond to FOLRl based therapy or allow for optimization of a
therapeutic regimen with a FOLRl antibody or Immunoconjugate. CTC FOLR1 quantitation can
provide information on the stage of tumor, response to therapy and/or disease progression. It can be
used as prognostic, predictive or pharmacodimamic biomarker.        In addition, staining of CTCs for
particular markers including, but not limited to FOLRl, may be used as a liquid biopsy either alone
 or in combination with additional tumor marker analysis of solid biopsy samples.
 VI.     Kits
 [01701         As a matter of convenience, the assay method of this invention can be provided in
 the form of a kit. Such a kit is a packaged combination including the basic elements of: (a) a first
 reagent, which can be a capture reagent, comprised of the monoclonal antibodies against human
 FOLR1; and/or (b) a second reagent which is a detection reagent. The detection reagent can also
 comprise FOLR1 monoclonal antibodies, but can also comprise detectable (labeled or unlabeled)
 antibodies that bind to FOLR1. These basic elements are defined hereinabove and in the Examples
 below.
  [01711         In one embodiment wherein the first reagent and the second reagent are antibodies,
 antigen-binding fragments thereof, or polyeptides that bind to FOLR1, the first and second reagents
 are different antibodies, antigen-binding fragments thereof, or polyeptides. In one embodiment, the
 first reagent binds to a different FOLR1 epitope than the second FOLR1 reagent. In onen
 embodiment, neither the first reagent or the second reagent competitively inhibits the binding of an

  active agent (e.g., a an active agent comprising an huMOv19 antibody or antigen-binding fragment
  thereof) from binding to FOLR 1,
  [0172]           In one embodiment, the kit further comprises a solid support for the capture
  reagents, which can be provided as a separate element or on which the capture reagents are already
  immobilized. Hence, the capture antibodies in the kit can be immobilized on a solid support, or they
  can be immobilized on such support that is included with the kit or provided separately from the
  kit.
  [01731           In one embodiment, the capture reagent is coated on a microtiter plate. The detection
 reagent can be labeled antibodies detected directly or unlabeled antibodies that are detected by
  labeled antibodies directed against the unlabeled antibodies raised in a different species. Where the
  label is an enzyme, the kit will ordinarily include substrates and cofactors required by the enzyme,
 and where the label is a fluorophore, a dye precursor that provides the detectable chiomophore.
 Where the detection reagent is unlabeled, the kit can further comprise a detection means for the
 detectable antibodies, such as the labeled antibodies directed to the unlabeled antibodies, e.g., in a
 fluorimetric-detected format. Where the label is an enzyme, the kit will ordinarily include
 substrates and cofactors required by the enzyme, where the label is a fluorophore, a dye precursor
 that provides the detectable chromophore, and where the label is biotin, an avidin such as avidin,
 streptavidin, or streptavidin conjugated to HRP or P-galactosidase with MUG.
 [0174]           In one embodiment, the capture reagent is the FOLRI antibody FRI -9 and the
 detection reagent is the FOLRI antibody FR1-13.              In another embodiment, the FRI-13 is
 biotinvlated.
 [01751           The kit also typically contains instructions for carrying out the assay, and/or FOLR1
 protein, or fragments thereof (e.g., FOLRI extracellular domain or the FOLRI extracellular domain
 and all or a part of the GPT linkage domain) as an antigen standard, as well as other additives such
 as stabilizers, washing and incubation buffers, and the like. In one embodiment, the FOLRI antigen
 standard is a FOLRI-Fc immunoadhesin, The kit can also include instructions for detection and
 scoring of FOLRI expression,
 [01761          The components of the kit will be provided in predetermined ratios, with the relative
amounts of the various reagents suitably varied to provide for concentrations in solution of the
reagents that substantially maximize the sensitivity of the assay. Particularly, the reagents can be
provided as dry powders, usually lyophilized, including excipients, which on dissolution will
provide for a reagent solution having the appropriate concentration for combining with the sample
to be tested.

 [01791           There were two different immunization/screening series. In the first series, mice

 were subcutaneously immunized with approximately 5x10 FOLR1 -expressing KB cells (American
 Tissue Culture Collection, ATCC CCL- 17). In the second series 300-19 cells expressing human
 FOLR1 on their surface were used to immunize mice. To make these cells, the human FOLR1
 amino acid sequence was obtained from the NCBI website (accession NP 057937), then it was
 codon optimized and synthesized by Blue Heron biotechnologies, flanked by EcoRI and Xbal
 restriction sites to facilitate cloning into the pSRa mammalian expression vector. 300-19 cells, a
 pre-B cell line derived from a Balb/c mouse (Reth et al., Nature, 317:353-355 (1985)), were
 transfected with the pSRa-FolR1 expression plasmid to stably express high levels of human FOLR1
                                                                                                     as
 on the cell surface. Standard immunization protocols known to those of skill, for example, such
 those used at ImmunoGen, Inc. were applied for both series. Immunized mice were boosted with
                                                                                      from mice was

                                                                                                   The
  sterile, frosted microscopic slides to obtain a single cell suspension in RPMI-1640 medium.
  spleen cells were centrifuged, pelleted, washed, and fused with a urine myeloma, such as, for
  example P3X63Ag8.653          cells (Kearney et al., J. Immunol., 123:1548-1550 (1979)) using
                                                                                        in RPMI-1640
  polyethylene glycol-1500 (Roche 783 641). The fused cells were resuspended
  selection medium containing hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) (Sigma H-0262) and

selected for growth in 96-well flat-bottomed culture plates (Coming-Costar 3596, 0.2 ml of cell
suspension per well) at 37"C with 5% CO2. After 5 days of incubation, 0.1 ml of culture
supernatant were removed from each well and replaced with 0.1 ml of RPMI-1640 medium
containing hypoxanthine-thymidine (HT) supplement (Sigma H-0 137). Incubation at 37'C with 5%
CO 2 was continued until hybridoma clones were ready for antibody screening. Other techniques of
immunization and hybridoma production can also be used, including those described in Langone et
al. (Eds., "Immunochemical Techniques, Part I", Methods in Enzymology, Academic Press, volume
121, Florida) and Harlow et al. ("Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual"; Cold Spring 11arbor
Laboratory Press, New York (1988)).

[01801          FOLR1-300-19 cells transfected with human FOLR1 and KB cells were used in the
first and second series of screenings correspondently. Culture supernatants from the hybridoma
were screened by flow cytometry for secretion of mouse monoclonal antibodies that bind to FOLR1
positive cells, such as FOLRI-expressing 300-19 cells or KB cells, but not to the FOLR1 negative
cells, such as non-transfected 300-19 cells. 0.1 ml of hybridoma supernatants was incubated for 3 h
                                                                              5
with either FOLR1- positive cells or the non-transfected 300-19 cells (1 x10 cells per sample) in
0.1 ml FACS buffer (RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 2% normal goat serum). Then, the
cells were centrifuged, pelleted, washed, and incubated for 1 hour with 0.1 ml of PE-conjugated
goat anti mouse IgG-antibody (such as obtainable from, for example Jackson Laboratory, 6 ptg/mL
in FACS buffer). The cells were centrifuged, pelleted again, washed with FACS buffer and
resuspended in 0.2 ml of PBS containing 1% formaldehyde. Cell-associated fluorescence was
measured using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with the HTS multiwell sampler or a FACS array
flow cytometer and analyzed using CellQuest Pro (all from BD Biosciences, San Diego, US).
Positive hybridoma clones were subcloned by limiting dilution. One subelone from each
hybridoma, which showed the same reactivity against FOLR1 as the parental cells by flow
cytometry, was chosen for subsequent analysis. Stable subelones were cultured and the isotype of
each secreted anti-FOLR1 antibody was identified using commercial isotyping reagents (Roche
 1493027). Murine antibodies were protein A purified from cleared hybridoma media as described
 above. These antibodies were designated FR-I antibodies.

[01811            One clone, muFR1-13, was identified as an anti-FOLR1 clone that (1)
compete or hinder the binding of Mov19 simultaneously to the same antigen, and (2) had a high
binding specificity to the target as demonstrated by common flow cytometry techniques (Figure 2A
and 2B). These two characteristics were necessary in the development of this assay, and so clone
muFR1-13 was chosen for use in the assay.
                                                                                                for
101821            From the remaining 64 anti-FOLR1 clone panel, a second antibody was required
the assay that held the same criteria as was necessary for muFRI-13. Additionally, the second
antibody could not compete or hinder the binding of muFRI -13 simultaneously to the same antigen
(i.e., Movl9, muFR1-13 and the final clone must have all distinctly separate epitopes). To satisfy
these conditions, a series of competition ELISA experiments were conducted on the remaining
                                                                                            similar
panel of 65 anti-folate clones (Figure 3A). If an antibody shares the same, or sterically
epitope to the antibody being detected, a reduction in signal is observed (Figure 3B). Using this
method, 5 antibodies of the 64 tested were identified as having epitopes that compete with Movl9,
 and hence were removed from further consideration.

 13 conjugated Biotin (Figure 4). Using this method, 6 additional clones were identified as having

 epitopes that compete with muFR1-13, and hence were removed from further consideration.

[01881            The PCR reaction mixtures were then run on a 1% low melt agarose gel, the
400 bp bands were excised, purified using Zymo DNA mini columns, and sent to Agencourt
Biosciences for sequencing. The respective 5' and 3' PCR primers were used as sequencing primers
to sequence the variable region cDNAs from both directions. The amino acid sequences of VH and
VL regions were obtained by translating the DNA sequencing results with VectorNTI software.
 [01891          The preliminary variable region cDNA sequences included 5' end sequences derived
from the degenerate PCR primers rather than the murine antibody mRNA so sequence comparisons
with mouse antibody germline sequences facilitated the identification and removal of these
                                                                                      utilized to search
 sequencing artifacts. The NCBI IgBlast site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/) was
 for the murine germline sequences from which the preliminary antibody cDNA sequences were
 derived and the primer derived 5' end sequences were replaced with the corresponding germline
                                                                                   the NCBI reference
 sequences. The cleaned up variable region sequences were then combined with
                                                                                          and D78344.1
 sequences for the murine kappa and IgG1 constant regions (accessions AJ294736.1
 respectively) to assemble expected full length murine antibody sequences. The molecular weight
 of the expected marine FRI-9 and FRI-53 light and heavy chains were then calculated and
 compared with the mass measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrophotometric analysis
 (LC/MS).
  [0190)          The initial efforts to sequence the murine FR1-9 light chain, following the methods
  described above, proved unsuccessful so alternative methods were employed. The light chain
                                                                                            PCR primer
  sequences of hybridomas related to FR1-9 were used to design the KS77LClead
  (ttttgagctctggattccagcctecagaggt) to anneal to the presumed leader sequence of the FR1-9 light
  chain framework. This leader primer PCR reaction and sequencing was performed as described
  above and yielded a complete cDNA sequence encoding a light chain that matches the FR1-9 light
  chain mass measured by LC/MS.
                                                 Example 6
                                       FOLR1 Fc fusion control sample

[0191]          A human folate receptor 1 Fe fusion molecule was constructed as an alternative
soluble antigen source to the human folate binding protein typically derived from human milk. The
amino-terminus of the human FoIRi cDNA, described in the immunization example above, was
excised from the full length sequence with an EcoRI and Pstl restriction digest. This fragment
contained the cDNA encoding the 233 amino acids from the N terminal signal peptide to the
residues just up stream of the GPI linkage site of huFolR1 (NCBI accession NM_016731.2).          A
Pstl to BamHI oligonucleotide linker facilitated the cloning of the FolR1 fragment in-frame with
the murine IgG2A hinge, CH2, and CH3 antibody constant region sequences (NCBI accession
P01863) in the pmuFc2ANL-EK mammalian expression plasmid. The human FolR1-Fc fusion
protein was then expressed by transient or stable transfections in mammalian host cell lines such as
HEK-293T or CHO cells.         Since the 475 amino acid fusion protein contains the murine IgG2A
constant region, the molecule was purified following the standard murine antibody purification
procedures described above.
                                              Example 7
                                       Shed antigen ELISA assay
[0192]          To assure that materials were continuously performing as expected, all antibodies
were screened for binding by both ELISA and flow cytometry methods known in the art. Flow
cytometry was performed using FOLR1 expressing human T47D cells cultured using in-vitro cell
culture techniques known in the art. The antibodies were bound to these cells and detected
indirectly using a goat anti-murine Alexa-fluor 488 detection antibody on a FACScalibur machine
(Figure 6A-B). The same methods were applied to the other antibodies, and it was determined that
                                                                                  9                9
the final selected antibodies FRI-13 and FR1-9 showed an approximately 1-3x10- M, and 2-4x10
binding affinity respectively by both methods.
 [0193]          It is important that the assay detect only FOLR1, and not FOLR2 or especially
FOLR3 (commonly found as a shed protein in human plasma), since Mov19 is specific for only
FOLR1. To determine this, the top four clones were screened by commercially available ELISA
kits (Figures 7A-B).      The positive control detection antibody shows a positive signal above
background indicating detection of FOLR2 or FOLR3. The remaining antibodies (FR1-9, FR1-53,
FR1-62, FR1-64, & Movl9) do not produce a signal in the assay, and therefore do not bind to
FOLR2 or FOLR3.
 [01941          Additionally, the presence of folic acid bound to FOLR1 could potentially obscure
the epitope of the chosen antibodies. To assure that the assay would detect FOLR1 in physiological

amounts of folic acid in human blood, folic acid was pre-incubated with the FOLR1 standard
purified protein and added to the assay plate. As shown in Figure 8, the presence of folic acid had
negligible impact on the detection affinity of the assay compared to positive controls containing no
folic acid. Therefore, it was concluded that the assay could detect FOLR1 even in the presence of
bound folic acid.
[01951           Since none of the top four antibody clones (FR1-9, 53, 62, or 64) showed
interference with the binding of Mov19 or FR1-13, and because no adverse binding properties were
observed in the presence of FOLR2, FOLR3, or folic acid, these four candidates of the original 64
clones were viable for use in the assay. Of these four clones, it was determined that clone FR1-9
and FR1-53 had higher binding affinities compared to FRI-62 and "R1-64. Production of the FRI
53 antibody from its parent hybridoma produced consistently poorer yield, and hence clone FR1-9
was chosen for its ease of antibody production, higher antibody purity, and percent monomer.
[01961           In efforts to optimize the assay, a systematic approach was used in which
concentrations of FR1-9, Biotinylated FR1-13, Strp-HRP, and respective incubation times were
optimized using FOLR1-Fc fusion protein as the antigen standard. The FOLR1-Fc fusion is a
fusion peptide of huFOLR1 and murine IgG2A hinge, CH2, CH3.                 Criteria for establishing
optimized conditions were reproducible signals with a high signal to noise ratio, minimal matrix
effects in human plasma samples, high repeatability and precision and lowest limit of detection.
[0197]           More specifically, the assay was performed by coating an assay plate with muFRl-9
at 2 jig/mL and incubated. After blocking with a non-specific protein, samples (including antigen
standards and human plasma samples) were added to the assay plates to incubate. Plates were then
washed and muFR1-13b detection antibody (2 jig/mL) was added to each well. Plates were washed
again before adding a molar excess of streptavidin conjugated Horse Radish Peroxidase (1:5,000).
The plate was washed again before 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), was added. TMB
reacted with the peroxidase to form a blue color, with an intensity commensurate with the amount
of FOLR1 present in the sample. The reaction was stopped with an acid containing solution, which
turned the color yellow. The assay was then read on a spectramax plate reader to determine the
intensity of the color reaction in each sample (absorbance). When necessary, a sigmoidal dose
response (variable slope) curve was generated with Graphpad Prism v5.04 software using the 4PL
equation: Y Bottom + (Top - Bottom)/l + 10^ ((LogEC50-X)* Hill Slope for all dilution series.
 [01981           To determine the adequacy of the final ELISA format, human ovarian cancer patient
plasma and non-tumor sourced human ascites samples were tested. In non-tumor bearing patients
 with ascites fluid, 15 samples were analyzed for the presence of FOLR1. No FOLR1 was detected
                                                - 64 -

by the assay in all 15 samples, and no false positives were observed due to matrix effects (Figure
9). Alternatively, these ascites samples had purified human FOLR1 protein added into them, and
the subsequent detection was performed. Recovery of the FOLR1 protein as determined by the
assay was greater than 85% of the known added amount (not shown). Therefore, it was assumed
there were no interfering proteins in non-tumor associated human ascites fluid even with no
dilution of the sample.
[01991          The same analysis was performed in pooled normal human plasma (pooled was
n=-10 patients per lot). No endogenous FOLR1 was detected by the assay, and no interfering
proteins were discovered in non-diluted samples of human plasma with added purified huFOLRl
Fc protein (Figure 10). Samples of human ovarian cancer plasma were provided by the Dana
Farber Cancer Institute or Mass General Hospital. Of the 72 samples analyzed to date, 7 samples
were identified as having detectable levels of FOLR1 with a range of 0.7 to 30.6 nM. A
representative analysis of this data is shown in Figure 11. Here, three of eight samples contained
detectable levels of FOLR1 showing 0.74, 0.91 and 30.6 nM for samples PB105, PB106, and
PB109 respectively. The method for interpolation of this data from a relevant standard curve
generated using huFOLR1-Fc is shown in Figure 12.

                                     Circulating Tumor Cell Assay
{02001          Three cell lines with varying levels of FOLR1 expression were selected as
representative of high expression (KB), low expression (OVCAR3), and no expression (A549).
Unlabeled FR1-9 and FR1-13, as well as a commercial anti-FOLR1 antibody ("commercial FRA"),
were titrated, and optimal titrations were determined for each of the antibodies using laser scanning
cytometry (LSC) detection on the selected cell lines. Fluorescence was measured as mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) and is shown in Figure 13. All three antibodies showed expression of
folate receptor in KB cells. Optimal dilutions were identified for each antibody as follows: 1:5 for
commercial FRA, 1:100 for muFR1-9, and 1:200 for muFR1-13.             Of the antibodies tested, the
commercial antibody gave the best signal to background ration (8.0 versus 4.07 (muFR1-9) and
4.19 (muFR1-13)), but only muFR1-9 showed a signal in the OVCAR3 cells (approximately 30%
more signal than A549 cells). See Figure 14.
 [0201]         For applications that include monitoring the treatment or efficacy with IMGN853,
the antibody selected for use in a CTC assay should not compete with the antibody component of
IMGN853 (i.e., huMovl9 (M9346A)) for binding to FOLR1. Competition assays were conducted
to determine if any of the antibodies competed with IMGN853 antibody for binding to FOLR1.
                                                 -65 -

For these assays, A549 (negative) and KB (high expressors) cells were treated with the M9346A
antibody or vehicle alone. Cells were then washed and stained with each of the three antibodies,
and expression was analyzed using LSC. The results are provided in Figure 15. Light bars (left)
represent vehicle alone, and dark bars (right) represent IMGN853 treated cells. If competition with
the therapeutic IMGN853 exists, then the dark bar (right) will be lower than the light bar (left) in
the KB cells. The results in Figure 15 show that the commercial FRA antibody competes for
binding with IMGN853 (~66% drop in FRA signal), while the muFR1-9 and muFR1-13 antibodies
were not affected by IMGN853 treatment.
[02021           Taken together, these results demonstrate that muFR1-9 and muFR1-13 did not
compete with IMGN853, thereby making them the more desirable candidates for use in an assay
that monitors FOLR1 levels in a bodily fluid (e.g., blood or plasma), circulating tumor cell, or
tissue sample, after treatment with IMGN853.          In addition, muFR1-9 was more sensitive and
demonstrated the unique ability to detect expression in OVCAR3 cells which had low levels of
expression and is the preferred candidate antibody for these types of assays.

 [02031          Blood samples are drawn from ovarian cancer or NSCLC cancer patients at the
following time points: Screening (up to 28 days prior to baseline); Baseline; Prior to Cycle 3; and
End of Cycle 4. CTCs are enriched from the samples and stained for CK, CD45, nuclei, and
 FOLR1 using the antibodies and dilutions described in Example 8, above. The number of CTCs
 (i.e., CK+/CD45- nucleated cells), the number of CK-/CD45- nucleated cells, the expression of
 FOLR1 on CTCs, the number of CK-/CD45- nucleated cells, and the percentage of FOLR1 positive
 CTCs and CK-/CD45- nucleated cells are determined by LSC for each sample. The data is used to
 determine FOLRl expression levels in CTCs at various time points during the Phase I clinical trial
 for IMGN853.
