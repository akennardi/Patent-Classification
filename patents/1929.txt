                                           TECHNICAL FIELD
           This invention relates to the treatment of flue gas wet scrubber processes. More
   particularly, the invention relates to the method of capture of selenium from flue gases by flue
15 gas wet scrubber processes. The invention also relates to minimizing corrosion in flue gas wet
   scrubber processes.
                                              BACKGROUND
           The demand for electricity continues to grow globally. In order to keep stride with the
   growing demand, coal is being looked to as a source for its generation. At present, burning coal
20 produces some 50% of the electricity generated in the United States. The burning of coal in
   power generation plants results in the release of energy, as well as the production of solid waste
   such as bottom and fly ash, and flue gas emissions into the environment. Emissions Standards,
   as articulated in The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 as established by the U.S.
                                                   1

        WO 2013/119544                                                           PCT/US2013/024735
    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), requires the assessment of hazardous air pollutants
    from utility power plants.
             The primary gas emissions are criteria pollutants (e.g. sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxides,
    particulate material, and carbon monoxide). About two thirds of all sulfur dioxide and a quarter
 5  of the nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere is attributable to electric power generation achieved by
    burning coal and other fuels.
             Secondary emissions depend on the type of coal or fuel being combusted but include as
    examples mercury, selenium, arsenic, and boron. Selenium chemistry is similar to sulfur
    chemistry where selenium exists in flue gas as selenium dioxide and immediately converts to the
 0  selenite ion upon absorption into the liquid stream within the flue gas wet scrubber process.
    While certain chemistries have been known to successfully capture heavy metal cations, such
    chemistries would not expect to be effective at reducing selenium concentrations in liquid waste
    generated from flue gas wet scrubber processes.
             Furthermore, because of the presence of high concentrations of halogens in the flue gas
 5  that is transferred to the scrubber liquor, flue gas wet scrubber processes can fail from corrosion.
    Recently, a metallurgy designated as 2205 alloy stainless steel has become popular in the
    industry due to its low cost and high chloride resistance. Typically, these scrubbers will operate
    with 10 to 12,000 ppm chloride concentration in their liquors. Unfortunately, flue gas wet
    scrubbers constructed of 2205 alloy have experienced increased levels of pitting and localized
 '0 corrosion, resulting in forced, unscheduled unit shutdowns and expensive repairs.
             One potential solution to the corrosion problem that has been implemented commercially
    is the use of potential adjustment protection ("PAP") systems. PAP systems apply an electrical
    potential across the metal surface in an effort to control and reduce corrosion. This method has
    been successful, but it requires the installation of electrodes into the scrubber and the constant
25  application of electrical potential and current. It also suffers from being applicable to only wet
    surfaces within the scrubbers.
             Another solution to the problem is the operation of flue gas wet scrubbers at less than
    2000 ppm chloride concentrations. While this prolongs the time between failures, it does not
    completely halt corrosion. Additionally, this solution results in higher blowdown rates,
30  translating into higher water usage, higher wastewater treatment costs, and overall higher
    operating costs.
             Consequently, there remains a need for a technology that can cost-effectively remove
    selenium from flue gas in flue gas wet scrubber processes. Ideally, the technology would have
                                                     2

   the added benefit of minimizing corrosion in flue gas wet scrubber processes. The invention
   described below addresses these needs.
                                   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

 5 gas wet scrubber process. The invention is also directed toward a method for minimizing
   corrosion in a flue gas wet scrubber process. Each method comprises the steps of burning fuel,

                             BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
 0          The benefits and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent
    to those of ordinary skill in the relevant art after reviewing the following detailed description and
    accompanying drawings, wherein:
            FIG. 1 is a graph demonstrating the positive effects of Chemistry 1 on decreased selenium
    concentration and decreased oxidation-reduction potential in the aqueous phase of a flue gas wet
 5  scrubber process; and
            FIG 2 is a graph demonstrating the positive effects of Chemistry 2 on decreased selenium
    concentration and decreased oxidation-reduction potential in the aqueous phase of a flue gas wet
    scrubber process.
                          DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 10         While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various forms, there will
    hereinafter be described a presently preferred embodiment with the understanding that the
    present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the invention and is not intended to
    limit the invention to the specific embodiment illustrated.
            It should be further understood that the title of this section of this specification, namely,
25  "Detailed Description of the Invention," relates to a requirement of the United States Patent
    Office, and does not imply, nor should be inferred to limit the subject matter disclosed herein.
            The present invention documents the unexpected results obtained from the use of certain
    chemistries, which unexpectedly reduced selenium concentration nearly ten-fold in water phase
30  blowdown of a flue gas wet scrubber process. While not wishing to be bound by a particular
    mechanism, through the addition of the chemistries within the flue gas wet scrubber process, the
    chemistries have the opportunity to capture the selenite before it has a chance to further oxidize
    to selenate. Selenate is difficult to remove from the water phase.
                                                      4

        WO 2013/119544                                                         PCT/US2013/024735
          Additionally, the chemistries have also proved to be advantageous in minimizing
  corrosion in flue gas wet scrubber systems. Particularly, the chemistries have helped minimize
  corrosion in flue gas wet scrubber systems that are constructed of 2205 alloy. It was
  unexpectedly found that these chemistries, when circulated in a flue gas wet scrubber process
  with flue gas wet scrubber liquor, reduced the oxidation-reduction potential ("ORP") within the
  flue gas wet scrubber process. The reduction of ORP reduces the tendency for corrosion.
  Examples showing the reduction are provided below.
          It is important to note that, while ORP is not exactly the same as corrosion potential, the
  two numbers track each other. ORP is an indication of the oxidative or reductive nature of the
  environment. Corrosion potential is the oxidative or reductive nature at the surface of a specific
  metal. Therefore, the corrosion potential generally reflects the ORP, but the two values are not
  the same. However, the ORP trend would typically indicate the corrosion potential trend.
  Hence, an observed reduction in ORP is expected to result in a reduction in corrosion potential.
  For the invention at hand, it was unexpected to see the addition of the chemistries, chelating
  agents for heavy metal removal, to result in a reduction in ORP value and thereby a reduction in
  corrosion rate.
          In an embodiment, the flue gas wet scrubber process comprises a wet flue gas
  desulfurizer process.
          In an embodiment, the flue gas wet scrubber process employs equipment comprising
  2205 alloy.
          In an embodiment, the fuel is selected from the group consisting of coal, reclailmed coal,
  natural gas, industrial waste, a gasified waste product, biomass, and any combination thereof.
  Chemistry 1:
5         Chemistry 1 is a water-soluble ethylene dichloride ammonia polymer having a molecular
  weight of from 500 to 10,000, which contains from 5 to 55 mole% of dithiocarbamate salt
  groups. Chemistry 1 may additionally comprise a transition metal salt, which may be an iron
  salt. The positive effects of Chemistry 1 on both reduction of selenium in the aqueous phase and
  reduction in oxidation-reduction potential are shown in FIG. 1. The ethylene dichloride
  ammonia polymers are prepared by the reaction of ethylene dichloride and ammonia. The
  starting ethylene dichloride-ammonia polymers generally have a molecular weight range of 500
   100,000. In a preferred embodiment the molecular weight is 1,500 to 10,000, with the most
  preferred molecular weight range being 1,500 to 5,000. The copolymer of this invention is
  produced using methods presented in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,731,187; 5,500,133; or 5,658,487 that
                                                    5

      WO 2013/119544                                                           PCT/US2013/024735
   are examples of said copolymers available for use in the claimed invention. The copolymer is
   produced by the reaction of the polyamines or polyimines with carbon disulfide to produce
   polydithiocarbamic acid or its salts. Such reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent such as
   water or alcohol at a temperature of from 300 and 100 C for periods of time ranging between 1
 5 and 10 hours. Good conversion is obtained at temperatures between 400 and 70'C for 2 to 5
   hours. These reaction conditions apply to the modification of ethylene dichloride-ammonia
   polymers described previously.
           The mole % of dithiocarbamate salt groups in the finished polymer generally is within the
   range of 5 to 55%. The preferred range is 20 to 55 mole %, with the most preferred range being
 0 about 30 to 55 mole %.
           The salts include but are not limited to alkaline and alkali earth such as sodium, lithium,
   potassium or calcium. The chemistry may include at least one transition metal salt, which may
   be an iron salt.
           The scrubber processes currently used in the industry include spray towers, jet bubblers,
 5 and co-current packed towers as examples. These types of air quality control devices
   ("AQCDs") are provided as examples and are not meant to represent or suggest any limitation.
   The water-soluble copolymer may be added to virgin limestone or lime slurry prior to addition to
   the scrubber, the recirculation loop of the scrubber liquor, or the "low solids" return to the
   scrubber from the scrubber purge stream.
 0         Typically, the copolymer is applied at a ratio of 1:1 to 2000:1 weight copolymer to weight
   of selenium being captured. The preferred ratio is from 5:1 to 1000:1 and the most preferred
   range is from 5:1 to 500:1.
           In general the polydithiocarbamic acid compounds may be introduced into the scrubber
   and thereby into the scrubber liquor via several routes. The following will serve as just some of
25 the variations that are available to introduce the compounds into the scrubber liquor. The
   scrubber liquor is defined as the water-based dispersion of calcium carbonate (limestone) or
   calcium oxide (lime) used in a wet flue gas scrubber ("FGS," also known as a wet flue gas
   desulfurizer, or "FGD") to capture SOx emissions. The liquor may also contain other additives
   such as magnesium and low-molecular weight organic acids, which function to improve the
30 sulfur, capture. One example of such an additive is a mixture of low-molecular weight organic
   acids known as dibasic acid ("DBA"). DBA consists of a blend of adipic, succinic, and glutaric
   acids. Each of these organic acids can also be used individually. In addition, another low
   molecular weight organic acid that can be used to improve sulfur capture in a wet scrubber is
   formic acid. Finally, the scrubber liquor will also contain byproducts of the interaction between
                                                   6

        WO 2013/119544                                                           PCT/US2013/024735
    the lime or limestone and sulfur species, which leads to the presence of various amounts of
    calcium sulfite or calcium sulfate. The scrubber liquor includes but is not limited to the make-up
    liquor, return liquor, the reclaimed liquor, virgin liquor and liquor injected directly into flue
    gases.
 5          Another addition point for the polydithiocarbamic compounds of this invention to the wet
    scrubber is via the "low solids" liquor return. A portion of the liquor is usually continuously
    removed from the scrubber for the purpose of separating reaction byproducts from unused lime
    or limestone. One means of separation that is currently used is centrifugation. In this process the
    scrubber liquor is separated into a "high solids" and "low solids" stream. The high solids stream
 0  is diverted to wastewater processing. The low solids fraction returns to the wet scrubber and can
    be considered "reclaimed" dilute liquor. The polydithiocarbamic acid compounds of this
    invention can conveniently be added to the reclaimed low solids stream prior to returning to the
    scrubber.
            Another feed liquor found in the operation of a wet flue gas desulfurizer is called "virgin
 5  liquor." Virgin liquor is the water-based dispersion of either lime or limestone prior to exposure
    to flue gas and is used to added fresh lime or limestone while maintaining the scrubber liquor
    level and efficiency of the wet FGD. This is prepared by dispersing the lime or limestone in
    water. Here the polydithiocarbamic acid compounds can be added either to the dispersion water
    or the virgin liquor directly.
 10         Finally, some wet scrubber installations use scrubber liquor and/or water (fresh or
    recycled) injected directly into the flue gas prior to the scrubber for the purpose of controlling
    relative humidity of the flue gas or its temperature. The excess liquid is then carried into the wet
    scrubber. Here also are two potential addition points for the introduction of the
    polydithiocarbamic acid compounds of the present invention.
25          The addition of the polydithiocarbamic acid compounds can be made in any of these
    locations, wholly or fractionally (i.e. a single feed point or multiple feed points), including but

       WO 2013/119544                                                          PCT/US2013/024735
                                                  R1

   wherein X = OR, OH and salts thereof, or NHR 2 and wherein Ri and R 2 is H or an alkyl or aryl
   group, wherein R is an alkyl or aryl group, wherein the molecular weight of said polymer is
   between 500 to 200,000, and wherein said polymer is modified to contain a functional group
 5 capable of scavenging one or more compositions containing one or more metals.
            The metals can include zero valent, monovalent, and multivalent metals. The metals may
   or may not be ligated by organic or inorganic compounds. Also, the metals can be radioactive
   and nonradioactive. Examples include, but are not limited to, transition metals and heavy metals.
   Specific metals can include, but are not limited to: copper, nickel, zinc, lead, mercury, cadmium,
 0 silver, iron, manganese, palladium, platinum, strontium, selenium, arsenic, cobalt and gold.
   The molecular weight of the polymers can vary. For example, the target species/application for

   weight can be calculated by various means known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For
   example, size exclusion chromatography, as discussed in the examples below can be utilized.
 5          When molecular weight is mentioned, it is referring to the molecular weight for the
   unmodified polymer, otherwise referred to as the polymer backbone. The functional groups that
   are added to the backbone are not part of the calculation. Thus the molecular weight of the
   polymer with the functional groups can far exceed the molecular weight range.
            In one embodiment, the molecular weight of the polymer is from 1,000 to 16,000.
20          In another embodiment, the molecular weight of said polymer is from 1,500 to 8,000.
   Various functional groups can be utilized for metal scavenging. The following phraseology
   would be well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art: wherein said polymer is modified to
   contain a functional group capable of scavenging one or more compositions containing one or
   more metals. More specifically, the polymer is modified to contain a functional group that can
25 bind metals.
            In one embodiment, the functional group contains a sulfide containing chemistry.

            The molar amounts of the functional group relative to the total amines contained in the
   unmodified polymer can vary as well. For example, the reaction of 3.0 molar equivalents of
                                                  8

    carbon disulfide to a 1.0:1.0 mole ratio acrylic acid / TEPA copolymer, which contains 4 molar
    equivalents of amines per repeat unit after polymerization, will result in a polymer that is
    modified to contain 75 mole % dithiocarbamate salt group. In other words, 75 % of the total
    amines in the unmodified polymer has been converted to dithiocarbamate salt groups.

    dithiocarbamate per mole of metal contained in the water. According to one embodiment of the
 '0 invention, the dosage of metal removal polymer required to chelate and precipitate 100 ml of 18
    ppm soluble copper to about 1 ppm or less was 0.011 gm (11.0 mg) of polymer. The metal
    polymer complexes formed are self-flocculating and quickly settle. These flocculants are easily
    separated from the treated water.
             In the context of applying the polymer to a gas system, such as a flue gas, the polymer
25  can be dosed incrementally and capture rates for a particular metal, e.g. such as mercury, can be
    calculated by known techniques in the art.

    Example 3:
             A synthetic FGD scrubber liquor was prepared by dissolving 12.58g of calcium chloride
    dihydrate, CaCl 2 *2H 20, in 400mL of deionized water. The resulting solution was 214mM in
    calcium chloride dihydrate leading to 15,000ppm chloride and 8560ppm calcium in solution.
 0  The solution was split into two equal portions. To 200mL of solution was added 164tL of
    0.61mM mercury nitrate solution to yield a solution containing 130pg/L of ionic mercury. This
    solution was treated with 27.4g of calcium sulfate dihydrate or 18 weight percent. The solution
    was mixed and split into two portions. The smaller portion, 75g total, was treated with the
    polydithiocarbamic acid compound at a 5:1 product to mercury weight ratio. The
 5  polydithiocarbamic acid compound product was a 30% active water miscible solution. The two
    portions were agitated separately with a magnetic stir bar for 12 hours. After which time, the
    suspension was filtered using a Pall Life Sciences GN-6 Metricel 0.45t membrane filter (P/N
    63069). The filtrate was analyzed for mercury.
             A second portion, 200g, of calcium chloride dihydrate solution was treated with 82pL of
 '0 0.61mM mercuric nitrate solution to yield a solution containing 78.3tg of ionic mercury. Again
    this solution was treated with 27.4g of calcium sulfate, dihydrate to yield a slurry containing 18%
    by weight. As before, this sample was split into two solutions, the minor portion, 75g, was
    treated with the polydithiocarbamic acid compound product at a 5:1 product weight to mercury
    weight ratio. After further mixing for 12 hours using a magnetic stir bar, the dispersions were

           It is clear from this example that the polydithiocarbamic acid compound of this invention
   removes the ionic mercury from the liquid phase. The gypsum solids for the above samples were
   submitted for TGA (Thermogravimetric Analysis) in order to observe any decomposition or
 5 release of mercury. All the thermographs were identical exhibiting only the loss of associated
   and bound water between room temperature and 170'C. Above this temperature no further
   decomposition could be observed. This indicates that once the complex is formed, it does not
   decompose under normal FGD scrubber operation.

           A general stock solution was prepared containing 0.214M calcium chloride dihydrate by
   dissolving 220g of CaCl 2 *2H 2 0 in 7L of deionized water. To this was added 74tL of 61mM
   mercury nitrate solution to yield a solution containing 136 tg/L. This solution was divided into
   two portions. The first portion was mixed with enough calcium sulfate dihydrate to yield slurry
15 at 18% by weight-dispersed solids. The second portion was mixed with enough calcium sulfate
   dihydrate to yield a 21 % by weight slurry.
           Organic acids are used in many wet FGD scrubbers to improve the SOx removal
   efficiency as well as the limestone or lime utilization. In most cases, a by-product stream known
   in the industry as Dibasic Acid or DBA is the product of choice. DBA is a mixture of adipic acid
20 (aka hexanedioic acid), succinic acid (aka butanedioic acid) and glutaric acid (aka pentaedioic
   acid). For the purposes of this example, a "synthetic" DBA was prepared using an equal molar
   ratio of adipic and succinic acids. The adipic acid can be obtained from Mallinckrodt Chemicals,
   Cat No. MK180159. The succinic acid can be obtained from J.T. Baker, reagent grade, Cat. No.

    Example 5:
            Three additives were tested in a bench-scale wet scrubber with a gas flow of 1 -cfm. One
    additive, TMT-15 is currently used to control mercury emissions from incinerators. The
    polydithiocarbamic acid compound, sodium salt used is an embodiment of the claimed invention.
 5          The bench-scale unit allows for the use of a simulated flue gas composed of S02, NOx,
    HCl, C0 2 , oxygen and nitrogen. Moisture is controlled by exposing a portion of the oxygen,
    carbon dioxide, and nitrogen to water saturators. The flue gas composition used in the study
    consisted of 15-25 ptg/Nm 3 HgCl 2 , 12% C0 2 , 3% 02, 1OOOppm SO 2 , l5ppm HCl, no NOx, the
    balance nitrogen. The flow rate was 28 L/min. The sorbent solution or scrubber liquor was
 0  maintained at a temperature of 55'C and consisted of 100mM sodium chloride, and 10mM
    sodium sulfate (initial concentration) with a pH of 5.0. The sulfite concentration was controlled
    at 5mM by the addition of hydrogen peroxide to the sorbent solution. The pH of the scrubber
    liquor was maintained by the addition of NaOH. In each case, the appropriate amount of additive
    was introduced into the scrubber liquor just prior to the injection of 0.5tM HgCl 2 as a solution of
 5  0.5mM HgCl 2 and after the system had reached equilibrium.
            The bench-scale scrubber uses a bubbler type gas contactor. The gas contact vessel sits
    on top of the scrubber liquor reaction vessel so that the liquor returns to the reactor vessel via
    gravity drainage. The liquor is recirculated into the scrubber via a recirculation pump to maintain
    a constant liquid/gas ratio. The pH is monitored both in the scrubber and in the reaction vessel.
 '0 The pH of the reaction vessel is maintained by addition of sodium hydroxide solution. The
    reaction vessel is mixed via magnetic stirring. A flow-through cell and spectrophotometer was
    used to monitor sulfite concentration in the scrubber liquor via a modification of a method
    reported by M.W. Scoggins, Analytical Chemistry, 42(9), 1091 (1970). The results were used to
    automatically control the addition of hydrogen peroxide so as to maintain the target sulfite
25  concentration. Oxidized mercury is added to the gas by passing a portion of the dry nitrogen gas
    through a mercury diffusion cell. About 5% of the total mercury introduced in this way was
    elemental. Two separate CVAAS (Cold Vapor Atomic Adsorption Spectroscopy) instruments
    monitored respectfully the flue gas inlet and the scrubber outlet. The mercury re-emissions were
    calculated as follows:

            Average re-emission   =  [average elemental Hg outlet]-[average elemental Hg inlet]

   so more efficiently than the current art.

 D with cold-side electrostatic precipitator ("ESP") and a flue gas wet scrubber process comprised of
   limestone forced oxidation ("LSFO") wet FGD system. The boiler fired high-sulfur sulfur
   bituminous coal. Samples of the LSFO wet FGD liquor were collected during the demonstration
   under the noted conditions and analyzed for total selenium. The results are presented in the table

   fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a condenser. While purging the headspace with nitrogen and
   stirring, methyl acrylate (16.636 weight %) was added dropwise over 30 min where the
   temperature was maintained between 25 - 310 C during the addition and for 1 h after the addition
   was finished. Next, a second charge of TEPA (18.275 weight %) was performed and the
 5 resulting reaction mixture was heated to 1300 C. This temperature was held for ~ 3 h while
   collecting the condensate in a Dean-Stark trap. At this time, the polymer melt was allowed to
   cool to 1200 C and then slowly diluted with deionized (DI) water (46.814 weight %) keeping the
   temperature above 900 C during the dilution. The resulting ~50 weight % polymer solution was
   then cooled to room temperature. Weight average molecular weight of the polymer was
20 determined to be 7,500 using a size exclusion chromatography method and polysaccharide
   standards.

 '0 Example 10:
             A sample of scrubber water was treated and then allowed to settle. A supernatant sample
    was taken and measured for total mercury content and then filtered for dissolved mercury
    content. The objective was to remove mercury. The samples were investigated for mercury
    removal relative to the dosage of Chemistry 2 in wet FGD liquors from two different coal-fired
25  power plants.
             The results show that a mercury level of less than 0.5 ppb in the treated water was
    achieved at reasonable product dosages. This work demonstrated that the polymer achieved
    mercury capture from wet FGD liquors. The lower detection limit of the analytical method was
    0.010 ppb. The efficient/effective action of mercury capture by Chemistry 2 can be extrapolated
30  to its ability to successfully prevent mercury re-emission within an operating wet FGD.
