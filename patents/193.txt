                                              RELATED APPLICATIONS
      [0001]               This application is a divisional application of Australian Application No.
             2015252981, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                                          FIELD
      [0002]               The present disclosure relates generally to implantable medical devices,
             and more specifically, to implantable devices for connecting tissue layers to
             create an anastomosis. Methods for using the implantable medical devices are
             also disclosed.
                                                    BACKGROUND
      [0003]               An anastomosis is a cross-connection between two tissue structures, such
             as blood vessels or intestines. For example, in the context of coronary artery
             bypass graft surgery, a graft vessel is anastomosed to a native coronary artery so
             that blood can flow through the graft vessel.
      [0004]               Anastomoses can be created in various manners including, but not limited
             to: end-to-end, end-to-side, and side-to-side anastomoses. Often, suturing is
             used to create such anastomoses.
                                                      SUMMARY

                                             DETAILED DESCRIPTION
      [00023]              Persons skilled in the art will readily appreciate that various aspects of the
             present disclosure can be realized by any number of methods and apparatus
             configured to perform the intended functions. It should also be noted that the
             accompanying drawing figures referred to herein are not necessarily drawn to
             scale, but may be exaggerated to illustrate various aspects of the present
             disclosure, and in that regard, the drawing figures should not be construed as
             limiting.
      [00024]              The present invention is directed to implantable devices for connecting
             tissue layers, for example, to circumvent a conduit or organ blockage, such as by
             creating a direct passage between tissue structures (e.g. connecting a
             gallbladder and a portion of a gastrointestinal tract) to create an anastomosis that
             facilitates material flow therebetween. The devices described herein may be
             endoscopically deployable or deliverable via a catheter and may include self
                                                            6
9919963_1 (GHMattes) P104116.AU.1

             expanding apposition mechanisms that facilitate a secure connection between
             the tissue structures (such a connection may also be referred to herein as a
             "shunt," "passageway," "shunt passageway," or "tunnel"). Such design features
             simplify implantation and reduce the likelihood of complications. In some
             embodiments, the devices provided herein are configured to be removable after
             implantation. As one example, the device is implanted and remains in place until
             the gallbladder and/or its associated ducts are cleared of blockages, after which
             the device is removed. In another example, the device remains implanted until
             the body grows a tissue-anastomosis around the device, and then the device is
             removed. In other embodiments, tissue ingrowth into and/or around the device
             permanently implants the device, and the device is not removed. The devices
             described herein can provide an alternative treatment for patients who are not
             suitable candidates for other types of treatments (e.g., gallbladder removal
             surgery) and/or to avoid known complications of other types of treatments (e.g.,
             external biliary drainage).
      [00025]              This document refers to anastomosis devices in an exemplary fashion.
             That is, it should be understood that the inventive concepts disclosed in this
             document can also be applied to other types of devices. For example, this
             document also provides implantable devices that, in some embodiments, can be
             used for occluding tissue structures, organs, body conduits, blood vessels, the GI
             tract, and the like. For example, in some embodiments the devices provided
             herein can be used to occlude septal defects. In some embodiments, the
             devices provided herein can be used to occlude a patient's vasculature or GI
             tract. In some such embodiments, the device does not include a tunnel through
             the device. Rather, in some embodiments a covering material seals the device to
             inhibit, modulate, or substantially prevent material from flowing through the
             device.
      [00026]              Referring to FIG. 1, an exemplary anastomosis device 40 in accordance
             with one or more provided herein can be implanted in a patient to create a fluidic
                                                        7
9919963_1 (GHMattes) P104116.AU.1

             connection between two organs, spaces, tissue structures, conduits, and the like,
             and combinations thereof. For example, in the depicted implementation the
             anastomosis device 40 is connecting a gallbladder 10 (that defines an internal
             gallbladder space 12) with an intestine 20 (that defines an internal intestinal
             space 22). Hence, the anastomosis device 40 is acting as a fluidic shunt device
             between the internal gallbladder space 12 and the internal intestinal space 22.
             Such an implementation may provide a beneficial treatment to the patient when,
             for example, a flow blockage exists in the native anatomical conduits connecting
             the internal gallbladder space 12 and the internal intestinal space 22. For
             example, in some instances the patient may have one or more gallstones that
             cause a blockage of the patient's cystic duct 14 and/or common bile duct 16. In
             such a case, the anastomosis device 40 can provide a fluidic passageway such
             that bile from the gallbladder 10 can flow into the intestine 20. If not for the
             anastomosis device 40, when bile is blocked from flowing out of the gallbladder
             10 cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder 10) may result.
      [00027]              While the anastomosis devices provided herein can be used in some
             implementations to relieve or prevent cholecystitis as described above, it should
             be understood that the anastomosis devices provided herein can also be used in
             many other types of implementations within a patient. For example, the
             anastomosis devices provided herein can be used in conjunction with various
             body tissue structures and organs such as, but not limited to, stomachs, colons,
             small intestines, pancreases, blood vessels, bladders, kidneys, conduits, and the
             like.
      [00028]              In general, some embodiments of the anastomosis devices provided
             herein (of which anastomosis device 40 is one type of example), include a first
             tissue apposition portion 42a, a second tissue apposition portion 42b, and a
             central portion 44 between the first and second tissue apposition portions 42a
             and 42b. The central portion 44 defines a lumen 46 that extends longitudinally
             from a first end of the anastomosis device 40 to a second end of the device 40.

             The lumen 46 acts as a connection (e.g., a shunt passageway) between the
             internal gallbladder space 12 and the internal intestinal space 22, such that the
             internal gallbladder space 12 is in fluid communication with the internal intestinal
             space 22 via the anastomosis device 40.
      [00029]              Referring to FIG. 2, an example anastomosis device 500 includes a
             framework of one or more elongate elements 501 that defines a first apposition
             portion 502, a second apposition portion 504, and a central portion 506 is
             depicted. The central portion 506 is disposed between and interconnects the first
             apposition portion 502 and the second apposition portion 504. In some
             embodiments, the central portion 506 is essentially cylindrical (although other
             geometries are also contemplated and are considered to be within the purview of
             the invention).
      [00030]              In some embodiments, a covering material 512 is disposed on at least
             some portions of the anastomosis device 500. As described further below, the
             covering material 512 can be disposed on some portions or on all of the first
             apposition portion 502, the second apposition portion 504, and/or the central
             portion 506. In some embodiments, portions of the first apposition portion 502,
             the second apposition portion 504, and/or the central portion 506 can remain free
             of the covering material 512.
      [00031]              In some embodiments, the central portion 506 defines a lumen 507 that
             extends between the first apposition portion 502 and the second apposition
             portion 504. In some implementations, the lumen 507 provides an anastomosis
             passageway or tunnel through which biological materials and/or fluids can pass.
             The device 500 is shown in an expanded configuration. The expanded
             configuration is the configuration that the device 500 naturally exhibits in the
             absence of external forces acting upon the device 500. In should be understood
             that when the anastomosis device 500 is implanted in a patient, the configuration
                                                        9
9919963_1 (GHMattes) P104116.AU.1

             of the device 500 may be somewhat different than shown because of the external
             forces from the patient's anatomy that are exerted on the device 500.
      [00032]              The anastomosis device 500 is shown in a deployed or expanded
             configuration. In some embodiments, the framework of the anastomosis device
             500, as described further below, can be made of a variety of metallic shape
             memory materials and super-elastic alloys. Thus, in some embodiments the
             central portion 506 (and/or the apposition portions 502 and 504) can be
             configured to self-expand to the deployed configuration. In some embodiments,
             the central portion 506 is balloon expandable to the deployed configuration, or
             supplemental expansion forces can be applied to a self-expandable device by
             balloon dilation. The diameter of the central portion 506 can be made in any size
             as desired in order to suit the intended use and/or delivery system of the
             anastomosis device 500.
      [00033]              When the anastomosis device 500 is configured in its expanded deployed
             configuration as shown, the diameter of the central portion 506 increases to a
             deployed diameter. The diameter of the central portion 506 can be made in any
             dimension as desired in order to suit the intended use and/or delivery system of
             the anastomosis device 500. In some implementations, the deployed outer
             diameter of the central portion 506 is configured to at least partially anchor the
             device 500 via an interference fit with the tissue aperture in which the central
             portion 506 resides. Additionally, when the central portion 506 and the tissue
             aperture have an interference fit relationship, para-device leakage may be
             reduced or minimized. In such a case, leakage of the contents of the organs,
             conduits, and other types of tissue structures in which the anastomosis device
             500 may be deployed can be substantially prevented. For example, when the
             anastomosis device 500 is used between a gallbladder and GI tract (e.g., refer to
             FIG. 1), leakage into the abdominal cavity can be substantially prevented.

      [00034]              In some implementations the deployed outer diameter of the central
             portion 506 is slightly less than the diameter of the tissue aperture in which the
             central portion 506 resides, and the apposition portions 502 and 504 compress
             the tissue to provide the migration resistance. In some embodiments, the fully
             expanded diameter of the central portion 506 is about 30 mm, or about 25 mm,
             or about 20 mm, or about 15 mm, or about 12 mm, or about 10 mm, or about 8
             mm, or about 6 mm, or about 4 mm, and the like. In some embodiments, the
             fully expanded diameter of the central portion 506 is in a range between about 20
             mm to about 30 mm, or about 15 mm to about 25 mm, or about 10 mm to about
             20 mm, or about 5 mm to about 15 mm, or about 4 mm to about 8 mm, and the
             like.
      [00035]              The length of the central portion 506 can be made in any dimension as
             desired in order to suit the intended use and/or delivery system of the
             anastomosis device 500. For instance, in one exemplary embodiment the central
             portion 506 is about 13.5 mm in length and about 15 mm in diameter. In some
             embodiments, the length of the central portion 506 can be in a range from about
             5 mm to about 10 mm, or about 8 mm to about 13 mm, or about 11 mm to about
             16 mm, or about 14 mm to about 19 mm, or about 17 mm to about 22 mm, or
             greater than 22 mm.
      [00036]              In some embodiments, the anastomosis device 500 has a framework that
             comprises one or more elongate elements 501. In some embodiments, the one
             or more elongate elements 501 are wound into the framework configuration. In
             some embodiments, a single elongate element 501 is wound to form the
             framework of the anastomosis device 500. In some embodiments, two or more
             elongate elements 510 are cooperatively wound to form the framework of the
             anastomosis device 500.
      [00037]              In some embodiments, the framework of the first apposition portion 502,
             the second apposition portion 504, and the central portion 506 are formed of one
                                                          11

             or more elongate elements 501 made of materials such as, but not limited to,
             spring wire (e.g., L605 steel or stainless steels), shape memory alloy wire (e.g.,
             nitinol or nitinol alloys), super-elastic alloy wire (e.g., nitinol or nitinol alloys),
             other suitable types of elongate elements or wires, or combinations thereof. In
             some embodiments, the first apposition portion 502, the second apposition
             portion 504, and the central portion 506 are formed from a precursor material that
             is cut to create the framework of elongate elements 501. In some such
             embodiments, the precursor material is a single piece of precursor material. In
             some embodiments, one or more elongate elements 501 are wound into a
             configuration to form the framework. In some embodiments, different types of
             elongate elements 501 are used at different locations of the first apposition
             portion 502, the second apposition portion, and/or the central portion 506. In
             some embodiments, the elongate elements 501 of the first apposition portion
             502, the second apposition portion 504, and/or the central portion 506 (or
             portions thereof) may be constructed of polymeric materials.
      [00038]              Suitable materials for the elongate elements 501 of the anastomosis
             device 500 and/or other devices provided herein include a variety of metallic
             materials including alloys exhibiting, shape memory, elastic and super-elastic
             characteristics. Shape memory refers to the ability of a material to revert to an
             originally memorized shape after plastic deformation by heating above a critical
             temperature. Elasticity is the ability of a material to deform under load and return
             to its original shape when the load is released. Most metals will deform
             elastically up to a small amount of strain. Super-elasticity refers to the ability of a
             material to deform under strain to much larger degree than typical elastic alloys,
             without having this deformation become permanent. For example, the super
             elastic materials included in the frames of some anastomosis device
             embodiments provided herein are able to withstand a significant amount of
             bending and flexing and then return to or substantially to the frame's original form
             without deformation. In some embodiments, suitable elastic materials include
                                                          12

             various stainless steels which have been physically, chemically, and otherwise
             treated to produce a high springiness, metal alloys such as cobalt chrome alloys
             (e.g., ELGILOYTM, MP35N, L605), platinum/tungsten alloys. Embodiments of
             shape memory and super-elastic alloys include the NiTi alloys, ternary shape
             memory alloys such as NiTiPt, NiTiCo, NiTiCr, or other shape memory alloys
             such as copper-based shape memory alloys. Additional materials could combine
             both shape memory and elastic alloys such as drawn filled tube where the outer
             layer is constructed of nitinol and the inner core is a radiopaque material such as
             platinum or tantalum. In this construct, the outer layer provides the super-elastic
             properties and the inner core remains elastic due to lower bending stresses.
      [00039]              In some embodiments, the elongate elements 501 used to construct the
             anastomosis device 500 and/or other devices provided herein can be treated in
             various ways to increase the radiopacity of the devices for enhanced
             radiographic visualization. In some embodiments, the devices are least partially
             a drawn-filled type of NiTi containing a different material at the core, such as a
             material with enhanced radiopacity. In some embodiments, the devices include a
             radiopaque cladding or plating on at least portions of the first apposition portion,
             the second apposition portion, and the central portion. In some embodiments,
             one or more radiopaque markers are attached to the devices. In some
             embodiments, the elongate elements and/or other portions of the devices
             provided herein are also visible via ultrasound, and may include portions with
             enhanced echogenicity.
      [00040]              In some embodiments, the materials and configuration of the anastomosis
             device 500 (and the other anastomosis device embodiments provided herein)
             allow the devices to be elastically crushed, folded, and/or collapsed into a low
             profile delivery configuration for containment within a lumen for transcatheter or
             endoscopic/thorascopic delivery, and to self-expand to an operative size and
             configuration once positioned at a desired target site within a body and deployed
             from the lumen. For example, in the low-profile delivery configuration the

             anastomosis device 500 can be disposed within a delivery sheath that has about
             a 15 Fr. (5 mm) outer diameter. However, in some embodiments, sheaths that
             are smaller or larger than 15 Fr. can be used. For example, sheaths that have
             outer diameters of 6 Fr., 7 Fr., 8 Fr., 9 Fr., 10 Fr., 11 Fr., 12 Fr., 13 Fr., 14 Fr., 16
             Fr., 17 Fr., 18 Fr., 19 Fr., 20 Fr., and larger than 20 Fr., can be used in some
             embodiments. While the anastomosis device 500 is configured in a collapsed
             delivery configuration, in some embodiments the framework of one or more
             elongate elements 501 is radially compressed such that the elongate elements
             501 are forced to extend substantially parallel to axis of the central portion 506,
             and the diameter of the central portion 506 is crushed to become smaller.
      [00041]              The anastomosis device 500 also includes the covering material 512
             (which may also be referred to herein as a "covering"). In some embodiments,
             the covering material 512 is disposed on at least some portions (or on all) of the
             first apposition portion 502, the second apposition portion 504, and the central
             portion 506. In some embodiments, some portions of the first apposition portion
             502, the second apposition portion 504, and/or the central portion 506 are not
             covered by the covering material 512.
      [00042]              In some embodiments, the covering material 512 is generally fluid
             impermeable. That is, in some embodiments the covering material 512 is made
             of a material that inhibits or reduces passage of blood, bile and/or other bodily
             fluids and materials through the covering material 512 itself. In some
             embodiments, the covering material 512 has a material composition and
             configuration that inhibits or prevents tissue ingrowth and/or endothelialization or
             epithelialization into the covering material 512. Some such embodiments that
             are configured to inhibit or prevent tissue ingrowth and/or endothelialization can
             be more readily removed from the patient at a future date if so desired. In some
             embodiments, the covering material 512, or portions thereof, has a microporous
             structure that provides a tissue ingrowth scaffold for durable sealing and/or
             supplemental anchoring strength of the anastomosis device 500.

      [00043]              In some embodiments, the covering material 512 comprises a
             fluoropolymer, such as an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) polymer,
             polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), or PVDA. In some embodiments, the covering
             material 512 comprises a polyester, a silicone, a urethane, biocompatible
             polymer(s), polyethylene terephthalate (e.g., Dacron@), bioabsorbable materials,
             copolymers, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the covering
             material 512 comprises a bioabsorbable web. In other embodiments, the
             bioabsorbable material may also provide an anti-migration feature by promoting
             attachment between the device 500 and tissue until the bioabsorbable material is
             absorbed.
      [00044]              In some embodiments, the covering material 512 (or portions thereof) is
             modified by one or more chemical or physical processes that enhance one or
             more properties of the material 512. For example, in some embodiments, a
             hydrophilic coating may be applied to the covering material 512 to improve the
             wettability and echo translucency of the material 512. In some embodiments, the
             covering material 512, or portions thereof, may be modified with chemical
             moieties that facilitate one or more of endothelial cell attachment, endothelial cell
             migration, endothelial cell proliferation, and resistance to or promotion of
             thrombosis. In some embodiments, the covering material 512, or portions
             thereof, may be modified to resist biofouling. In some embodiments, the
             covering material 512, or portions thereof, may be modified with one or more
             covalently attached drug substances (e.g., heparin, antibiotics, and the like) or
             impregnated with the one or more drug substances. The drug substances can
             be released in situ to promote healing, reduce tissue inflammation, reduce or
             inhibit infections, and to promote various other therapeutic treatments and
             outcomes. In some embodiments, the drug substance may be, but is not limited
             to a corticosteroid, a human growth factor, an anti-mitotic agent, an
             antithrombotic agent, a stem cell material, or dexamethasone sodium phosphate.

             framework of the anastomosis device 500. Additionally, one or both sides of the
             covering material 512, or portions thereof, may be coated. In some
             embodiments, certain coatings and/or treatments are applied to the covering

             other coatings and/or treatments are applied to the material(s) 512 located on
             other portions of the anastomosis device 500. In some embodiments, a
             combination of multiple coatings and/or treatments are applied to the covering
             material 512, or portions thereof. In some embodiments, certain portions of the
             covering material 512 are left uncoated and/or untreated. In some embodiments,
             the device 500 is fully or partially coated to facilitate or frustrate a biological
             reaction, such as, but not limited to, endothelial cell attachment, endothelial cell
             migration, endothelial cell proliferation, and resistance to or promotion of

      [00046]              In some embodiments, a first portion of the covering material 512 is
             formed of a first material and a second portion of the covering material 512 is
             formed of a second material that is different than the first material. In some
             embodiments, the covering material 512 is comprised of multiple layers of
             materials, which may be the same or different materials. In some embodiments,
             portions of the covering material 512 have one or more radiopaque markers
             attached thereto to enhance in vivo radiographic visualization of the anastomosis
             device 500, or one or more echogenic areas to enhance ultrasonic visibility.
      [00047]              In some embodiments, one or more portions of the covering material 512
             are attached to the framework of the device 500, such as the central portion 506
             and/or the apposition portions 502 and 504. The attachment can be
                                                        16

             accomplished by a variety of techniques such as, but not limited to, stitching the
             covering material 512 to the framework of the device 500, adhering the covering
             material 512 to the framework of the device 500, laminating multiple layers of the
             covering material 512 to encompass portions of the elongate members of the
             device 500, using clips or barbs, laminating multiple layers of the covering
             material together through openings in the framework of the device 500. In some
             embodiments, the covering material 512 is attached to the framework of the
             device 500 at a series of discrete locations, thereby facilitating the flexibility of the
             framework. In some embodiments, the covering material 512 is loosely attached
             to the framework of the device 500. It is to be appreciated that the covering
             material 512 may be attached to the framework using other techniques or
             combinations of techniques described herein.
      [00048]              In some embodiments, the framework of the device 500 (or portions
             thereof) is coated with a bonding agent (e.g., fluorinated ethylene propylene or
             other suitable adhesive) to facilitate attachment of the covering material 512 to
             the framework. Such adhesives may be applied to the framework using contact
             coating, powder coating, dip coating, spray coating, or any other appropriate
             means.
      [00049]              The covering material 512 can adapt to changes in the length and/or
             diameter of the central portion 506 in a variety of manners. In a first example,
             the covering material 512 can be elastic such that the covering material 512 can
             stretch to accommodate changes in the length and/or diameter of the device 500.
             In a second example, the covering material can include slackened material in the
             low-profile delivery configuration that becomes less slackened or totally
             unslackened when the device 500 is in the expanded configuration. In a third
             example, the covering material 512 can include folded portions (e.g., pleats) that
             are folded in the low-profile configuration and less folded or totally unfolded when
             the device 500 is in the expanded configuration. In some embodiments,
             combinations of such techniques, and/or other techniques can be used whereby
                                                       17

             the covering material 512 can adapt to changes in the length and/or diameter of
             the central portion 506.
      [00050]              The one or more elongate element(s) 501 of the central portion 506 can
             be configured in various ways to define a generally cylindrical framework. In the
             embodiment depicted in FIG. 2, the elongate element(s) 501 of the central
             portion 506 are wound circumferentially around the central portion 506. In
             addition to the circumferential winding, the elongate element(s) 501 can exhibit
             other winding paths, such as the wavy or serpentine path shown (e.g.,
             approximately sinusoidal) and other paths. In the depicted embodiment, the
             winding path of the elongate element(s) 501 in the central portion 506 has eight
             apices per circumference, and an apical length of about 3.5 mm. In some
             embodiments, the elongate element(s) 501 of the central portion 506 can be
             made to have more or less than eight apices per circumference, and can be
             made to have an apical length of more than or less than 3.5 mm, as desired to
             suit a particular application. For example, in some embodiments the elongate
             element(s) 501 of the central portion 506 can be made to have three, four, five,
             six, seven, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, or more
             than sixteen apices per circumference. In some embodiments, the elongate
             element(s) 501 of the central portion 506 can be made to have an apical length in
             a range of about 1 mm to about 2 mm, or about 2 mm to about 3 mm, or about 3
             mm to about 4 mm, or about 4 mm to about 5 mm, or about 5 mm to about 6 mm,
             or about 6 mm to about 7 mm, or greater than 7 mm.
      [00051]              In some embodiments, the apposition portions 502 and 504 include one or
             more flange components 502a and 504a, respectively. Such flange components
             (e.g., flange components 502a and 504a) may also be referred to herein as
             "fins," "petals," or "fingers." The flange components 502a and 504a are
             configured to contact tissues and to exert an apposition pressure thereto. While
             the depicted embodiment includes four flange components 502a and four flange
             components 504a, other quantities of flange components 502a and 504a can be
                                                       18
9919963_1 (GHMatter) P104116.AU.1

             included. For example, in some embodiments one, two, three, five, six, seven,
             eight, or more than eight flange components 502a and/or 504a may be included.
             In some embodiments, unequal numbers of flange components 502a and flange
             components 504a are included.
      [00052]              The flange components 502a and 504a can be configured to exert a
             predictable and desired apposition force when in contact with tissue. For
             example, the material(s), the diameter, and other properties of the elongate
             element can be selected to attain a desired apposition force. Elongate elements
             (e.g., nitinol elongate members) can be made to have a particular diameter as
             desired. Elongate elements made of other suitable materials and with larger or
             smaller diameters can be selected as desired. The geometry of the flange
             components 502a and 504a can also affect the apposition force exerted by the
             flange components 502a and 504a. That is, geometry aspects such as, but not
             limited to, the length, width, radii, angles, arcs (and the like) of the flange
             components 502a and/or 504a can be selected to attain a desired apposition
             force.
      [00053]              In some embodiments, the flange components 502a and 504a can be
             configured to have an offset orientation between the opposite end portions of the
             anastomosis device 500. That is, the axes of one or more of the individual flange
             components 502a may be offset (e.g., skewed, or out of alignment) from the axes
             of one or more of the individual flange components 504a. In some such
             embodiments, some or all of the flange components 502a and 504a can be
             configured to cross each other (e.g., overlap each other in an interposing
             arrangement). In some such embodiments, some or all of the flange
             components 502a and 504a may be offset from each other but not crossing each
             other. However, in some embodiments the axes of one or more of the individual
             flange components 502a may be generally in alignment (e.g., substantially
             parallel) with the axes of one or more of the individual flange components 504a.
             In some such embodiments, some or all of the flange components 502a and
                                                       19
9919963_1 (GHMattes) P104116.AU.1

             504a can be configured to abut each other. In some such embodiments, some or
             all of the flange components 502a and 504a may be in alignment with each other
             but not abutting each other.
      [00054]              In some embodiments, one or more of the flange components 502a and/or
             504a may vary in configuration in comparison to one or more others of the flange
             components 502a and/or 504a. For example, the flange components 502a can
             protrude farther towards the central portion 506 than the flange components
             504a (or vice versa). Or, one or more of the flange components 502a or 504a
             can protrude farther towards the central portion 506 than others of the flange
             components 502a or 504a respectively.
      [00055]              In some embodiments, one or more of the flange components 502a and/or
             504a may have two or more portions with differing curvatures (radii). For
             example, in the depicted embodiment, at least some of the flange components
             502a and/or 504a extend from the central portion 506 at a first radius, and then
             straighten to a generally linear portion, and then curve along a second radius
             after which the flange components 502a and/or 504a terminate. In some
             embodiments, the first radius is unequal to the second radius. In some
             embodiments, the first and second radii are curved in opposite directions from
             each other.
      [00056]              In some embodiments, a radius 558 of the flange components 502a and
             504a protrudes beyond the central portion 506 of the device. Therefore, the
             force applied by the flange components 502a and 504a may push some tissue
             into the radius 558, thereby making a longer and potentially stronger or less leak
             prone anastomosis. In some embodiments, the radius 558 of curvature is
             determined by the allowed strain of the nitinol material when loaded into a
             delivery system (e.g., sheath). For example, in some embodiments a strain of
             about 6.4% may result. However, other strain levels of less than or more than
             about 6.4% are used in some embodiments.

      [00057]              In some implementations, including multiple flange components 502a and
             504a may tend to reduce the potential for causing tissue ischemia. In some
             embodiments, individual flange components 502a are configured differently from
             each other, and/or individual flange components 504a are configured differently
             from each other. In some embodiments, the flange components 502a and 504a
             can remain discrete from each other (as shown), or in some embodiments the
             flange components 502a and 504a are interconnected to each other by, for
             example, the covering 512. In some embodiments, the flange components 502a
             and 504a can oppose or not oppose each other, can crisscross over each other,
             can have different geometries (e.g., lengths, widths, angles, radii, shapes, etc.).
             All combinations of such design features can be combined to create anastomosis
             devices of a wide variety of configurations. In some embodiments, one or both of
             the flange components 502a and 504a protrude from the central portion 506 at
             an axial orientation and shape to achieve a specific desired apposition pressure
             on the tissue.
      [00058]              In some embodiments, one or more of the shape of the flange
             components, the number of flange components, the elongate element size, and
             the tissue thickness are factors that are selectable to achieve a specific force
             profile vs. displacement. For example, referring to FIGS. 3-6, various exemplary
             flange component designs 510, 520, 530, and 540 are shown. The free ends
             shown in FIGS. 3-6 are where the flange components design 510, 520, 530, and
             540 would extend from the device body (e.g., anastomosis device 500). The
             force vs. displacement curves for each is shown in FIG. 7.
      [00059]              The exemplary flange component 510 includes a sharply descending
             region 511 extending to the edge of the central portion (not shown), and a
             substantially horizontal region 513 extending away from the device. The
             exemplary flange component 520 includes a moderately sharp descending
             region 514 connected to and a sloping region 515 extending away from the
             device. The exemplary flange component 520 includes a linearly descending
                                                       21
9919963_1 (GHMattes) P104116.AU.1

             region 522 extending away from the device. The exemplary flange component
             530 includes a gradual sloping curved region 532 extending away from the
             device. In some embodiments, one or more regions of the flange components
             longitudinally extend towards the central portion of the device of which the flange
             components are part of (e.g., towards central portion 506 of anastomosis device
             500).
      [00060]              Particular flange component force vs. displacement profiles (e.g., flange
             components 510, 520, 530, and 540) may be advantageous for achieving a
             desired apposition pressure and/or other performance characteristics. For
             example, referring to FIG. 7, a graph of force vs. displacement shows the
             apposition force that can be applied by each flange component 510 (51Of), 520
             (520f), 530 (530f), and 540 (540f). The force vs. displacement profile of flange
             component 510 can include a steep linear slope, as shown by 510f. Curve 5lOf
             may be of particular benefit if the organs to be apposed are not close
             together. The linear and quickly increasing force would resist separation of the
             organs. In some embodiments, the force vs. displacement profile of flange
             component 520 can include a shallow linear slope that abruptly changes to a
             steep linear slope (520f). Curve 520f may be of particular benefit for creating
             high apposition force during the initial healing phase while the anastomosis is
             being created. During this time the tissue may be thicker and inflamed utilizing
             the steep linear profile of 520f. As the tissue inflammation and resulting tissue
             thickness reduced, the shallow part of curve 520f would be employed helping to
             avoid necrosis of the tissue. The force vs. displacement profile of flange
             component 530 produces a shallow linear slope (530f). Curve 530f provides a
             shallow linear increase in force with respect to displacement and may be
             particularly useful for tissue that is considered friable and prone to perforation. In
             other embodiments, the force vs. displacement profile of flange component 540
             can include a continuously increasing slope (540f). Such variations of flange
                                                        22
9919963_1 (GHMatter) P104116.AU.1

             components (and other variations also contemplated within the scope of this
             disclosure) can be selected for a particular application as desired. For example,
             the force vs. displacement curve achieved by flange component 540 may be
             advantageous in particular applications because the curve smoothly increases
             and the design allows for a broad area of contact over a large range of
             displacement.
      [00061]              FIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate another example anastomosis device 1200.
             Anastomosis device 1200 is an example variation of the anastomosis device 500
             described above. In particular, the anastomosis device 1200 has first and
             second apposition portions 1202 and 1204 that are designed differently than the
             first and second apposition portions 502 and 504 of anastomosis device 500. As
             described further below, the one or more apposition members 1208 and 1210
             that make up the first and second apposition portions 1202 and 1204 can be
             configured to provide functional properties that are desirable in some
             implementations.
      [00062]              In some embodiments, the framework of the device 1200 or any portion
             thereof can comprise elongate elements such as a spring wire (e.g., L605 steel
             or stainless steels), shape memory alloy wire (e.g., nitinol or nitinol alloys), super
             elastic alloy wire (e.g., nitinol or nitinol alloys), other suitable types of wire, or
             combinations thereof. In the depicted embodiment of device 1200, the
             framework includes an elongate element that is formed by winding, for example.
             In some embodiments, different types of wires are used at different locations of
             the device 1200. Alternatively, device 1200 or portions thereof can be formed
             from the same piece of precursor material that is cut to create the elongate
             element framework structure as desired. In some embodiments, the device 1200
             or portions thereof may be constructed of polymeric materials. The device 1200
             is shown with a covering material, as described above. It should be understood
             that anastomosis device 1200 can be constructed using any of the materials and
                                                         23
9919963_1 (GHMatter) P104116.AU.1

             techniques described in reference to any and all other anastomosis devices
             described herein.
      [00063]              The central portion 1206 of the device can be constructed to have a
             tailored radial strength by, for example, varying the elongate element's sine wave
             amplitude, angle, number of apices per row, number of rows, wire diameter, and
             by selecting (or not selecting) a covering material. For anastomosis device
             applications, the radial strength of the central portion 1206 may be designed to
             resist circumferential loading from the surrounding tissue. Therefore, in some
             embodiments the radial strength of the central portion 1206 is configured to
             facilitate remodeling of the tissue external to the central portion 1206 to become
             approximate in size to the outer diameter of the central portion 1206. When the
             anastomosis device 1200 (and the other anastomosis devices provided herein) is
             implanted to form an anastomosis, the radial strength of the central portion 1206
             provides resistance to the hoop force applied by the surrounding tissue.
             Therefore, an anastomosis device with strong radial strength in the central
             portion (e.g., central portion 1206) will substantially maintain an open lumen at a
             desired dimension. In addition, a device with strong radial strength can
             advantageously act as a scaffold for tissue to grow around the device.
      [00064]              In some embodiments, the materials and configuration of the anastomosis

             collapsed into a low-profile configuration for containment within a lumen for
             transcatheter or end oscopic/thorascopic delivery, and to self-expand to an
             operative size and configuration once positioned at a desired target site within a
             body and deployed from the lumen.
      [00065]              The first apposition portion 1202 and the second apposition portion 1204
             are configured to engage one or more layers of tissue between the first and
             second apposition portions 1202 and 1204, and to provide apposition forces
             against the tissue surfaces. The apposition forces provided by the first and

             second apposition portions 1202 and 1204 can facilitate fixation of the device
             1200 to the tissue, and provide migration resistance such that the device 1200
             can reliably remain positioned at a target site in a patient as desired.
      [00066]              The first apposition portion 1202 and the second apposition portion 1204
             each include one or more apposition members 1208 and 1210 respectively. The
             anastomosis device 1200 can be configured in a collapsed low-profile delivery
             configuration in which the apposition members 1208 and 1210 are radially
             compressed such that they extend substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of
             the device. In the deployed or expanded configuration, the apposition members
             1208 and 1210 protrude outwardly from the central portion 1206.
      [00067]              In some embodiments, at least one of the apposition members 1208
             and/or 1210 is orientated to have a first angle 1216 in relation to the central
             portion 1206 and to have a second angle 1214 in relation to the central portion
             1206 (as shown in FIG. 9). In other words, in some embodiments at least one
             apposition member 1208 and/or 1210 is non-planar. In the depicted embodiment
             the apposition member 1210 is orientated at a first angle 1216 in relation to the
             central portion 1206, and the apposition member 1210 is also oriented at a
             second angle 1214 in relation to the central portion 1206. In some embodiments,
             the first angle 1216 is a shallow angle. For example, in some embodiments the
             angle 1216 is acute, e.g., less than about 900, or less than about 750, or less
             than about 60', or less than about 450, or less than about 30', or less than about
             25', or less than about 20', or less than about 15', or less than about 100, or less
             than about 50. In some embodiments, the angle 1216 is between about 150 and
             about 200, or between about 100 and about 300, or between about 50 and about
             450.
      [00068]              Because in some embodiments the angle 1216 is relatively shallow, and
             because the apposition member 1210 extends towards the central portion 1206,
             a portion of the apposition member 1210 is therefore orientated relatively close to
                                                          25

             the access location (i.e., the incision location in which the anastomosis device
             1200 will be deployed). Hence, this configuration facilitates an effective and
             sustainable apposition of tissue.
      [00069]              In some embodiments, the second angle 1214 is a larger angle than the
             first angle 1216. For example, in some embodiments the angle 1214 is greater
             than about 900, less than about 450, less than about 250, less than about 200,
             less than about 150, less than about 100, or less than about 50. In some
             embodiments, the angle 1214 is between about 300 and about 400, or about 200
             and about 450, or about 300 and about 500, or about 400 and about 600, or about
             500 and about 700, or about 600 and about 800, or about 700 and about 900. In
             some embodiments the second angle 1214 is larger than the first angle 1216
             such that a portion of the apposition member is orientated farther away from the
             access location. While, the shallow angle of the first angle 1216 permits tissue
             contact resulting in apposition force near the access location, the larger angle of
             the second angle 1214 permits tissue contact away from the access location,
             providing anti-migration forces to keep the device 1200 in place. Moreover, in
             some embodiments the larger angle of the second angle 1214 permits the
             terminal ends of the apposition members 1208 and/or 1210 to be out of contact
             with tissue in situ. In some such implementations, by having fins pointing away
             from the apposed tissue, the potential for tissue over-growth on fins can be
             delayed or avoided. By delaying or avoiding tissue overgrowth the device can be
             easily removed when/if needed. In some embodiments, a single apposition
             member of this design can provide the benefits that are associated with having
             dual length apposition members.
      [00070]              In some embodiments, the apposition members 1208 and 1210 are in
             axial alignment with each other such that the positions of the apposition
             members 1208 and 1210 around the periphery of the central portion 1206
             longitudinally coincide with each other. In some embodiments, the apposition
             members 1208 and 1210 are out or axial alignment with each other such that the
                                                      26

             positions of the apposition members 1208 and 1210 around the periphery of the
             central portion 1206 do not longitudinally coincide with each other. In some such
             embodiments, one or more of the apposition members 1208 of the first
             apposition portion 1202 longitudinally overlap (e.g., criss-crossed in an
             interposing arrangement) with one or more of the apposition members 1210 of
             the second apposition portion 1204, as depicted in FIGS. 8 and 9. In some
             embodiments, some or all of the apposition members 1208 and 1210 may be
             offset from each other, or in alignment with each other, while not crossing each
             other. In some embodiments, some or all of the apposition members 1208 and
             1210 may be in alignment with each other and abutting each other.
      [00071]              Referring to FIGS. 10-12, an anastomosis device 1300 is shown having a
             central portion 1306 that is interchangeable with any other central portion
             described herein, a first apposition portion 1302, and a second apposition portion
             1304. In some embodiments, the framework of device 1300 or any portion
             thereof can comprise one or more elongate elements such as a spring wire (e.g.,
             L605 steel or stainless steels), shape memory alloy wire (e.g., nitinol or nitinol
             alloys), super-elastic alloy wire (e.g., nitinol or nitinol alloys), other suitable types
             of wire, or combinations thereof (as described above in reference to elongate
             element 501).
      [00072]              In the depicted embodiment of device 1300, the framework is comprised
             of a single elongate element that is formed by winding and shape-setting, for
             example. In some embodiments, different types of elongate elements are used
             at different locations of the device 1300. Alternatively, the anastomosis device
             1300 (or portions thereof) can be formed from the same piece of precursor
             material that is cut and expanded to create the elongate element framework
             structure as desired. In some embodiments, the device 1300 (or portions
             thereof) may be constructed of polymeric materials. It should be understood that
             anastomosis device 1300 can be constructed using any of the materials and
                                                       27

             techniques described in reference to any and all other anastomosis devices
             described herein.
      [00073]              In some embodiments, the framework of the central portion 1306 can be
             configured such that the central portion 1306 is longitudinally extendable. For
             example, in the depicted embodiment of anastomosis device 1300 the framework
             of the central portion 1306 includes serpentine-wound portions that allow for
             longitudinal extension and retraction (like a spring). Accordingly, the longitudinal
             length of the central portion 1306 can self-adjust based on in vivo loading forces.
             This feature can be advantageous, for example, in maintaining apposition when
             the tissue thickness changes during the healing process (e.g., in at least some
             cases of acute cholecystitis). It should be understood that this feature can be
             incorporated into any of the device embodiments described herein.
      [00074]              The device 1300 may include a covering material 1312. In some
             embodiments, the covering 1312 is made of stretchable (elastic-like) material that
             can have a high percentage of recoverable strain (e.g., recoverable strain in the
             magnitude of 100s of percentage per unit length). Some embodiments of such
             covering materials may include, but are not limited to, pure silicone, urethane
             material, or such materials that are imbibed in or laminated to other materials
             including, but not limited to, flouropolymers such as ePTFE. In some
             embodiments, the covering material 1312 is as described herein (e.g., similar or
             identical to covering material 512).
      [00075]              The first apposition portion 1302 and the second apposition portion 1304
             are configured to engage one or more layers of tissue between the first and
             second apposition portions 1302 and 1304, and to provide apposition forces
             against the tissue surfaces. The apposition forces provided by the first and
             second apposition portions 1302 and 1304 can facilitate attachment of the device
             1300 to the tissue and provide displacement resistance such that the device
             1300 can reliably remain positioned at a target site in a patient as desired.

      [00076]              The first apposition portion 1302 and the second apposition portion 1304
             each include one or more apposition members 1302a or 1302a' and 1304a or
             1304a' (also referred to herein as anchor members, fins, flange portions, petals,
             etc.). In some embodiments, the apposition members 1302a and 1304a are bare
             elongate elements (without a covering). In some embodiments, the apposition
             members 1302a' and 1304a' have the covering material 1312 disposed on at
             least some areas of their elongate elements.
      [00077]              In some embodiments, one or more of the apposition members 1302a or
             1302a' and/or 1304a or 1304a' have different configurations (e.g., geometries,
             lengths, widths, shapes, etc.) than one or more other apposition members 1302a
             or 1302a' and/or 1304a or 1304a'.
      [00078]              In some embodiments, the materials of the anastomosis device 1300
             allow the device 1300 to be elastically crushed, folded, and/or collapsed into a
             low-profile configuration for containment within a lumen for transcatheter or
             endoscopic/thorascopic delivery, and to self-expand to an operative size and
             configuration once positioned at a desired target site within a body and deployed
             from the lumen. For example, the anastomosis device 1300 can be configured in
             a collapsed delivery configuration in which the framework is compressed to a
             low-profile such that the apposition members 1302a or 1302a' and 1304a or
             1304a' extend substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the device 1300. In
             the deployed or expanded configuration, the apposition members 1302a or
              1302a' and 1304a or 1304a' extend outwardly from the central portion 1306.
      [00079]              In some embodiments, the lengths of some of the apposition members
             1302a or 1302a' and 1304a or 1304a' are dissimilar to provide both sufficient
             apposition forces near the periphery of the access location or hole where access
             is created, and anti-migration forces farther away therefrom. For example, in
             some embodiments one or more of the apposition members 1302a or 1302a' is
             longer than one or more of the apposition members 1304a or 1304a'. In some
                                                          29
9919963_1 (GHMatter) P104116.AU.1

             embodiments, the apposition members 1302a or 1302a' and/or 1304a or 1304a'
             have varying lengths and are alternated, or arranged around the periphery of the
             first apposition portion 1302 and/or the second apposition portion 1304 in a
             pattern. In some embodiments, the apposition members 1302a or 1302a' and/or
             1304a or 1304a' within each apposition portion 1102 and/or 1104 are uniform in
             length.
      [00080]              In some embodiments, the apposition members 1302a or 1302a' and/or
             1304a or 1304a' have lengths that are selected based at least in part on the size
             of tissue structures that the device 1300 is to be implanted into. For example, if a
             first tissue structure generally includes smaller geometry than the second tissue
             structure, having differing lengths of the apposition members 1302a or 1302a'
             versus 1304a or 1304a' can be advantageous. In this example, the apposition
             portion entering the smaller tissue structure may beneficially have apposition
             members with a shorter length, while longer apposition members may be better
             suited in the larger tissue structure. In some such implementations, the shorter
             length apposition members provide an appropriate fit for the smaller tissue
             structure thus ensuring sufficient tissue contact necessary for an anastomosis
             device, while the longer apposition members provide anti-migratory forces that
             help to retain the device in place. In some embodiments, such short and long
             apposition members 1302a or 1302a' and/or 1304a or 1304a' are staggered,
             nested, or separated around a periphery of a particular apposition portion 1302
             and/or 1304.
      [00081]              The anastomosis device 1300 (and other embodiments that share design
             features of the anastomosis device 1300) can exhibit the following advantages.
             Having varying lengths of apposition members 1302a or 1302a' and/or 1304a or
              1304a' can provide apposition at various target tissue locations. Having one or
             more such specific apposition zones may minimize or eliminate leakage of fluid
             or other contents that pass through the device lumen. Discrete apposition
             members 1302a or 1302a' and/or 1304a or 1304a' that move independently of
                                                      30
9919963_1 (GHMatter) P104116.AU.1

             each other can provide advantageous apposition member conformability to non
             planar tissue topography. Better conformability can minimize tissue injury
             especially when used in a diseased tissue bed. The flexible discrete design of
             the apposition members 1302a or 1302a' and/or 1304a or 1304a' can facilitate
             device 1300 removal by folding the apposition members 1302a or 1302a' and/or
             1304a or 1304a' parallel to the lumen of the device 1300. This flexibility of the
             apposition members 1302a or 1302a' and/or 1304a or 1304a' may help to
             minimize tissue injury during removal of the anastomosis device 1300.
      [00082]              Referring to FIG. 13, another example central portion 206 can be included
             as part of any the anastomosis devices provided herein. As with the central
             portions 506, 1206, and 1306, the central portion 206 is comprised of a
             framework of one or more elongate elements. For enhanced visibility, the central
             portion 206 is shown without a covering material, however the covering
             material(s) described elsewhere herein can be applied to the central portion 206
             in some embodiments. In this example, the central portion 206 is shown in an
             undeployed or low-profile delivery configuration. When deployed in a patient, the
             central portion 206 can self-expand or be forced to expand to an expanded
             configuration.
      [00083]              The one or more elongate elements of the central portion 206 can be
             constructed from the same types of materials and can be constructed using the
             same types of techniques as described above in reference to the elongate
             elements of anastomosis device 500. In some embodiments, the central portion
             210 is formed by one or more wound wires. In some embodiments, the central
             portion 206 is formed from a unitary piece of precursor material that is cut to
             create the elongate element framework structure as desired. In some such
             embodiments, the precursor material is a tube (e.g., a nitinol tube) that is laser
             cut to form the desired elongate element framework structure. In some such
             embodiments, the precursor material is a sheet (e.g., a nitinol sheet) that is laser
             cut to form the desired elongate element framework structure. In some
                                                         31
9919963_1 (GHMatter) P104116.AU.1

             embodiments, different types of elongate elements are used at different portions
             of the central portion 206. For example, in some embodiments the central
             portion 206 or portions thereof may be constructed of polymeric materials.
      [00084]              The central portion 206 includes one or more axial adjustment members
             218 extending along the longitudinal axis of the central portion 206. The axial
             adjustment members 218 allow the axial length (also referred to herein as
             "longitudinal length") of the central portion 206 to elastically extend or contract
             (as described above in reference to the framework of the central portion 1306 of
             anastomosis device 1300).
      [00085]              The central portion 206 also includes one or more cells 212. In some
             embodiments, the one or more cells 212 interconnect the axial adjustment
             members 218. The cells 212 allow for the radial expansion and contraction of
             the central portion 206, and provide radial strength to the device to maintain its
             shape/size while resisting external compression forces. During radial expansion
             of the central portion 206, the cells 212 expand in the circumferential direction
             and collapse in the longitudinal direction. While the cells 212 are shown as
             having a diamond-like shape, other geometries may be used. In the depicted
             embodiment, pairs of cells 212 are interconnected to each other in the
             circumferential direction by a bridge member 213. However, in some
             embodiments a single cell 212, or more than two cells 212, may be included
             (rather than the pair shown).
      [00086]              In some embodiments, the cells 212 are unconnected to adjacent cells
             212 along the longitudinal axis of the central portion 206. As such, the cells 212
             connecting to the axial adjustment members 218 do not substantially constrain
             the axial expansion or contraction of the axial adjustment members 218 and/or
             the central portion 206. In some embodiments, the cells 212 provide radial
             strength to the central portion 206. That is, in some embodiments the cells 212
             tend to self-expand into an expanded configuration. Such self-expansion can
                                                         32
9919963_1 (GHMatter) P104116.AU.1

             provide radial forces from the central portion 206 to the tissues in that are
             contacted by the central portion 206.
      [00087]              In some embodiments, axial length of the central portion 206 is adjusted
             before or during deployment, e.g., by a clinician to accommodate differences in
             tissue thicknesses. In other embodiments, the axial adjustment member 218
             self-responds to mechanical forces exerted on the deployed anastomosis device
             in situ. For example, the axial adjustment member 218 permits the axial length
             of the device to dynamically adjust during the healing process (as described
             above in reference to central portion 1306).
      [00088]              The anastomosis devices provided herein are deployable to a target site
             within a patient using one or more catheters, delivery sheaths, and other suitable
             devices and techniques. In some implementations, the anastomosis devices
             provided herein are deployable using an endoscopic or laparoscopic approach.
      [00089]              It should be understood that one or more design features of the
             anastomosis devices provided herein can be combined with other features of
             other anastomosis devices provided herein. In effect, hybrid designs that
             combine various features from two or more of the anastomosis device designs
             provided herein can be created, and are within the scope of this disclosure.
      [00090]              In some such embodiments, the device does not include a tunnel or
             central aperture through the device.
      [00091]              In some embodiments the devices provided herein can be used for sealing
             or anchoring a heart valve implant. A heart valve implant enables one-way flow
             of blood from a heart chamber and usually has a first inflow end and a second
             outflow end. The contractions of the heart cause flow of blood through the valve
             from the inflow end to the outflow end. Between the inflow and outflow ends, a
             valve assembly within the heart valve implant provides for one way flow, opening
             to allow flow from the inflow to the outflow end when the pressure of the blood is
                                                         33
9919963_1 (GHMatter) P104116.AU.1

             higher on the inflow end, and closing to prevent flow when the pressure on the
             outflow end is higher than the inflow end. In some embodiments, the device
             includes a tunnel or central aperture through the device with apposition portions
             to anchor a valve assembly and seal against backward flow. A valve assembly
             can be attached in the tunnel or central aperture. The apposition portions of the
             device can be configured to be highly conformable to the topography of the heart
             chambers or blood vessels, and compliant with the beating movements of the
             heart. In some embodiments, a covering material is configured to allow flow
             through a valve assembly in the tunnel or aperture while preventing flow around
             the apposition portions.
      [00092]              The invention of this application has been described above both
             generically and with regard to specific embodiments. It will be apparent to those
             skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the
             embodiments without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Thus, it is
             intended that the embodiments cover the modifications and variations of this
             invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their
             equivalents.
      [00093]              It is to be understood that, if any prior art publication is referred to herein,
             such reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part
             of the common general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country.
      [00094]              In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the
             invention, except where the context requires otherwise due to express language
             or necessary implication, the word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises"
             or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the presence of the
             stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further features in
             various embodiments of the invention.
