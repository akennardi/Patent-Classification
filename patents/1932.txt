                   SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DOWNHOLE COMMUNICATION
     CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
             [0001] The present application is a divisional of parent application 2014347199, the
     content of which are incorporated herein by reference.
  5  BACKGROUND
            [0002] In the downhole drilling and completion industry, the formation of boreholes for the
     purpose of production or injection of fluid is common. The boreholes are used for exploration or
     extraction of natural resources such as hydrocarbons, oil, gas, water, and alternatively for C02
     sequestration. To increase the production from a borehole, the production zone can be fractured
 10 to allow the formation fluids to flow more freely from the formation to the borehole. The
    fracturing operation includes pumping fracturing fluids including proppants at high pressure
    towards the formation to form and retain formation fractures.
            [0003] Efforts are continually sought to improve methods for conducting multi stage
    fracture treatments in wells typically referred to as unconventional shale, tight gas, or coal bed
15  methane. Three common methods currently in use for multi stage fracture treatments include
    plug and perf stage frac'd laterals, ball drop frac sleeve systems, and coiled tubing controlled
    sleeve systems. While these systems serve their purpose during certain circumstances, there are
    demands for increasing depths and flexibility and increasing number of stages. For example,
    balls and landing seats used in ball drop frac sleeve systems have a limited number of stages in
20  cemented applications and require expensive drill out.
            [0004] Also, conventional multi stage frac methods do not have the technology to evaluate
    data real time and optimize their operations appropriately. The ability to provide critical real time
    data to evaluate and properly conduct operations is a desirable feature in downhole operations.
    Existing methods for installing electrical control lines, however, require splices or connections at
25  each device or monitoring point. These splices require excessive rig time and are prone to
    failure. In addition, transmission of large amounts of power through control lines is problematic.
           [0005] As time, manpower requirements, and mechanical maintenance issues are all
    variable factors that can significantly influence the cost effectiveness and productivity of a multi
    stage fracturing operation, the art would be receptive to improved and/or alternative apparatus
30  and methods for downhole communications and improving the efficiency of multistage frac
    operations.
           [0005A] Reference to any prior art in the specification is not an acknowledgment or
    suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any jurisdiction or

20 string into a borehole, the string having at least a first sleeve assembly and a second sleeve
   assembly, the first sleeve assembly in a position closing a port in the string; communicating from
   a radial exterior of the string or from a location downhole of the first and second sleeve
   assemblies to a first electronic trigger of the first sleeve assembly to trigger the first sleeve
   assembly into moving longitudinally relative to the string to open the port; performing a

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         [0024] A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the disclosed apparatus
 and method are presented herein by way of exemplification and not limitation with reference
to the Figures.
         [0025] FIG. IA shows a communication and control system 10 configured to enable
 communication in a well or borehole 12. In one exemplary embodiment, the borehole 12 is
an extended reach borehole having a vertical section 14 and a highly deviated reach or
extension 16. By "highly deviated" it is meant that the extension 16 is drilled significantly
away from vertical section 14. The extension 16 may be drilled in a direction that is
generally horizontal, lateral, perpendicular to the vertical section 14, etc., or that otherwise
approaches or approximates such a direction. For this reason, the highly deviated extension
 16 may alternatively be referred to as the horizontal or lateral extension 16, although it is to
be appreciated that the actual direction of the extension 16 may vary in different
embodiments. A true vertical depth ("TVD") of the borehole 12 is defined by the vertical
section 14, and a horizontal or deviated depth or displacement ("HD") is defined by a length
of the extension 16 (as indicated above, the "horizontal" depth may not be truly in the
horizontal direction, and could instead be some other direction deviated from vertical), with a
total depth of the well equaling a sum of the true vertical depth and the horizontal depth. In
one embodiment, the total depth of the well is at least 15,000 feet, which represents a
practical limit for coiled tubing in this type of well.
         [0026] The borehole 12 is formed through an earthen or geologic formation 18., the
formation 18 could be a portion of the Earth e.g., comprising dirt, mud, rock, sand, etc. A
tubular, liner, or string 22 is installed through the borehole 12, e.g., enabling the production
of fluids there through such as hydrocarbons.
        [0027] A control line 50 is run into the borehole 12 as part of the instillation of the
tubular string 22. The control line 50, as shown in FIG. IB, includes an outer tube 53, an
insulated copper wire 51 that may in some embodiments be grounded in the bottom (toe 30)
of the string 22, and in other embodiments return through an interior of the string 22 to a
ground at an uphole location. In some applications, a fiber optic cable 52 is also encapsulated
                                                  4

 in the control line 50. A control unit and/or monitor/operator unit 24 is located at or
 proximate to the entry of the borehole 12. The unit 24 could be, or include, e.g., a wellhead,
 a drill rig, operator consoles, associated equipment, etc., that enable control and/or
 observation of downhole tools, devices, parameters, conditions etc. Regardless of the
particular embodiment, operators of the system 10 are in signal and/or data communication
with the unit 24, e.g., with various control panels, display screens, monitoring systems, etc.
known in the art.
          [0028] Pluralities of self-powered devices 26 and 27 that do not require a splice or
 direct connection to the control line 50 are included along the length of the string 22 in the
borehole 12. The devices 26 and 27 are illustrated schematically and could include any
 combination of tools, devices, components, or mechanisms that are arranged to receive and/or
transmit signals wirelessly to facilitate any phase of the life of the borehole 12, including,
 e.g., drilling, completion, production, etc. For example the devices 26 and 27 could include
sensors (e.g., for monitoring pressure, temperature, flow rate, water and/or oil composition,
etc.), chokes, valves, sleeves, inflow control devices, packers, or other actuatable members,
etc., or a combination including any of the foregoing.
          [0029] Frac Sleeve systems are represented by the devices 27, and packing systems
are represented by the devices 26. In one exemplary embodiment, the devices 26 are
swellable packers that allow for the control line 50 to be inserted in an axial groove therein
for instillation. These types of packers react to well fluids and seal around the control line 50
without the need for a splice. The devices 26 and 27 may further comprise sensors for
monitoring a cementing operation. Of course any other operation, e.g., fracing, producing,
etc. could be monitored or devices used for these operations controlled. All devices 26, 27
are capable of receiving commands from the control line 50 by induction or other
communication modes without splices in the control line 50. Each of the devices 26, 27 is
capable of storing its own power if required in the form of an atmospheric chamber, chemical
reaction, stored gas pressure, battery, capacitor or other means. Thus, the devices 26, 27 are
self-powered tools.
          [0030] Advantageously, system 10 enables signal communication between devices,
units, communicators, etc., (e.g., between the devices 26 and 27 and the unit 24) that would
not have been able to communicate without splices in a control line in prior systems. The
control line 50 is secured to tubing string 22, such as by strapping or otherwise fastening,
which is a relatively simple process and requires minimal additional hardware or rig time
from a deployment point of view, as compared to splices of a conductor which require
                                                  5

 additional hardware and slow down the deployment of such a cable, Since the purpose of the
 control line 50 in the system 10 is to wirelessly transmit a communication/triggering signal
 (as opposed to delivering power to a device) then splices can be avoided if, in one exemplary
 embodiment, the communication is transmitted inductively. Due to the devices 26, 27 having
self-contained sufficient power to move from first to second conditions, the only requirement
of the control line 50 is to provide the triggering signal. At a given location and fairly
proximate a device's electronic trigger (as will be further described below), the control line
50, such as an encapsulated conductor (tubing encapsulated cable "TEC" or Hybrid Cable),
passes through or by an inductive coupling device 40, shown in phantom, to detect the
transmission of an electrical signal. The inductive coupling device 40 employs near field
wireless transmission of electrical energy between a first coil or conductor in the inductive
coupling device 40 and a second coil or conductor electrically connected to the electronic
trigger in the device 26, 27, so that current can be induced in a conductor within the device
26, 27 without making direct physical contact with the control line 50 on the exterior of the
string 22. The magnetic field in the inductive coupler 40 will induce a current in the device
26, 27. The power or amplitude of the signal is only important in that it must be substantial
enough to produce an inductive measurement through the cable armor (outer tube 53). As the
same control line 50 may pass through or by a plurality of inductive couplers 40, the
frequency or pattern of the inductive signal sent by the control line 50 could be used to
communicate with a specific selected trigger within one of the devices 26, 27 located along
the string 22. The system 10 thus enables a method for conducting multi stage frac
operations combining control line telemetry, without the need for splices and power
transmission, with electronically triggered downhole self-powered driven devices 26, 27.
         [0031] In another exemplary embodiment, variable frequency current 31 is sent down
the insulated copper wire 51. The copper wire 51 is electrically connected to the toe 30 of the
string 22 with return ground for the current placed at surface in unit 24, the well head or some
distance from the wellhead in an appropriate surface location 32 relative to extension 16.
Since long wavelength EM Through Earth signals will be generated by long wavelength
current and these signals travel through the earth/formation 18 placement of the ground may
be selected to allow for measurement of resistivity changes in the subsurface formations as
water displaces oil. The signal may also be modulated by devices 26 and 27 and gap subs 28
(as will be further described below) in the string 22 to carry telemetry data. These EM
telemetry techniques complete a circuit and enable signals in the form of current pulses or the
like to be picked up and decoded, interpreted, or converted into data. In an additional
                                                 6

 exemplary embodiment, surface communicators 42 may be provided at or proximate the
 surface 32 to provide communication between the devices 26, 27 and gap subs 28 or other
 downhole communicators provided along the string 22 and the control/monitoring unit 24.
 Such intermediate communicators are further described in U.S. Patent Publication No. US
 2013/0306374, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
          [0032] As further shown in FIG. IA, and with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, each device
 26 and 27 may also have an electrical insulation section or gap sub 28 to allow for
 interruption or control of current flow at that location in string 22. The current 31 is
 delivered in a downhole direction 44 via the spliceless control line 50 from the well head, e.g.
 control unit 24 or surface 32, to the toe 30, at which point it is redirected in an uphole
 direction 46 to the devices 26, 27, 28 within the string 22. Thus, this embodiment does not
 require the inductive coupling devices 40, In the electrically closed position shown in FIG. 3,
 current will flow through the gap sub 28 with no effective resistance and in the open position,
 shown in FIG. 2, no current 31 will flow through the gap sub 28. By varying resistance from
open to closed positions, data from measurements such as pressure, temperature, valve
movement etc may be communicated to surface 32. It is also understood that instructions
may be encoded in the current 31 to command action in any individual device 26, 27 and
each device 26, 27 may send data back to surface 32. In addition to telemetry, the gap sub
device 28 may contain capacitors or batteries 33 that are charged by the current 31.
         [0033] With respect to FIGS. 1A to 3, the system 10 may include a spliceless control
line 50 in communication with end devices 26, 27, 28 wherein the spliceless control line 50 is
at least spliceless from downhole to uphole at least two adjacent end devices 26, 27, 28. The
system 10 includes a plurality of devices 26, 27, 28 and the system 10 includes a spliceless
control line 50 extending in a spliceless manner from downhole of the downhole most device,
e.g. device 27 closest to toe 30, to uphole of the uphole most device, e.g. device 28 closest to
vertical section 14, of the plurality of devices 26, 27, 28.
         [0034] Turning now to FIGS. 4-7, a method of conducting multiple stage fracture
treatments in a borehole 12, or other treatments such as, but not limited to, chemical
injection, steam injection, etc., through a radial opening, is shown to include installing at least
one sleeve system 27 having two or more sleeve assemblies 54, 56 that have a first closed
position, such as the run-in condition shown in FIG. 4, and a second open position as shown
in FIG. 5, relative to radial communication from an interior 58 of the string 22 to the annulus
70 (FIG. IA) between the exterior 23 of the string 22 and the borehole wall 13 of the
borehole 12. The self-powered first and second sleeve assemblies 54, 56 have sufficient
                                                  7

 stored energy to move from the first to the second position. The instructions from the control
 line 50 to one of the two or more sleeve assemblies 54, 56 to move from the first closed
 position to the second open position may be delivered via induction or control line 50 from
 the toe 30 and gap subs 28 as described above. The open position shown in FIG. 5 reveals
 one or more ports 72 in the string 22. Fracturing fluid may then be injected through the frac
 sleeve system 27, through the ports 72, and into the annulus 70 towards the borehole wall 12
 to initiate fractures in the formation 18. After the fracturing operation is completed,
 instructions from the control line 50 trigger the second sleeve assembly 56 to move to the
 third closed position shown in FIG. 6, to block the ports 72. The closed second sleeve
 assembly 56 may additionally include at least one dissolvable material or disintegration insert
 34 that will disintegrate, leaving a corresponding number of apertures 74 in the sleeve
 assembly 56, substantially aligned with the ports 72, as shown in FIG. 7, after all zones have
been treated. In one exemplary embodiment, the insert 34 may be made of a controlled
 electrolytic metallic ("CEM") nanostructure material, such as the material used in IN
TallicTM disintegrating frac balls available from Baker Hughes, Inc. The insert 34 thus
 dissolves, whereas the remainder of the second sleeve assembly 56 does not. At this point,
another frac sleeve system 27 may be moved in the manner shown in FIGS. 4-7 to open,
perform a fracturing operation, and subsequently close the first and second sleeve assemblies
54, 56.
          [0035] In lieu of providing a dissolvable insert 34 as shown in FIGS. 4-6, a fourth
open position is shown in FIG. 8. The second sleeve assembly 56 in this embodiment would
be required to contain at least sufficient power to move this second time, and may include a
second electronic trigger to initiate this additional movement. To produce through the ports
72, the second sleeve assembly 56 is moved an additional time from the closed position
shown in FIG. 6 to the open position shown in FIG. 8. Additional sleeve assemblies 56 may
be opened after treatment for production. The production sleeves may have a screen or filter
35 as shown in FIG. 9.
          [0036] FIG. 10 shows a communication and control system 100, which expands upon
the communication and control system 10 by including the string 22 as previously described
with respect to FIG. IA as a main or first lateral, and additionally including a lateral borehole
36 in a stacked lateral configuration with the main borehole 12 for a multilateral system. The
lateral borehole 36 contains a lateral casing, liner, string tubular 80, etc. and niay further
include an additional control line 51 extending along the tubular 80. A method of wireless
EM through-earth communication from the string 22 (the main bore lateral) to the tubular 80
                                                  8

 (a branch multi lateral well section) includes installing the control line 50 onto the liner 22 (as
 in FIG. IA), activating one or more gap subs 28 to the electrically open position (FIG. 2) to
 insulate an uphole portion of the string 22 from a downhole portion of the string 22 relative to
 a location of the electrically opened gap sub 28, forming an EM antenna 37 having an
 approximate length of the downhole portion of the string 22, sending EM signals 35 to the
tubular 80 in the lateral borehole 36 or another lateral (not shown) or surface 32. By
 activating various gap subs 28 along the string 22, the antenna length 37 will be varied.
Then, the strength of the signal 35 from the borehole 12 to the surface 32 or other laterals 36
 can be measured. Measurements can be used to determine effective resistance of the
 formation 18 indicating water movement.
          [0037] Each transmitter site on the string 22 can contain a non-conductive coupling
via the gap sub 28, electrically isolating the section of the string 22 downhole the transmitter
from that uphole. The transmitting current, EM signal 35, is injected into the formation 18
across this nonconductive section (at opened gap sub 28), and the resultant field is detected
by electrodes at the surface 32 or sea floor or by the lateral 36. The downhole transmitter can
be impedance-matched to the surrounding formation 18 to achieve power efficiency. For
land-based applications, at the surface 32, transmitter current can be injected into the
formation 18 through electrodes (not shown) driven into the formation 18 at some distance
from the wellhead (see, for example, locations of surface communicators 42 shown in FIG.
 1A). A portion of the transmitter current can flow along the length of the downhole string 22
and be detected at the nonconductive coupling, gap sub 28. To transmit data back to the
surface 32, a current will be injected across the two isolated sections of the downhole string
22, and sensed at the electrodes as it flows back to the surface 32. For shallow offshore
applications, the technique can be similar, with the electrodes replaced by an exposed
conductor on a cable, laid on the sea floor.
         [0038] Turning now to FIG. 11, an exemplary embodiment of the device 26 will be
described. The device 26 includes an electronic trigger 60 to activate a packer element 64,
similar to Baker Hughes's MPas-e commercially available remote-set packer system with
eTrigger technology. This packer's trigger is typically adapted to be activated by time,
pressure, temperature, accelerometers, magnetic or RFID methods. Operational actions of
this packer are accomplished by activation of atmospheric chambers 61 that are opposed by
hydrostatic pressure 62. However, in the embodiments of a device 26 described herein, the
electronic trigger 60 of the device 26 may be alternatively or additionally activated from a
radial exterior location 23 of the string 22 via induction (through inductive coupling device
                                                  9

 40 shown in FIG. 1A) or EM telemetry, or from a toe 30 of the string 22 to the electronic
 trigger 60, such as via the control line 50 and gap subs 28, as shown in FIGS. 1-3 and 10, to
 provide the system 10 described herein with real time two way telemetry or data
 transmission. Thus, the system 10 described herein is a more versatile alternative.
          [0039] The device 26 employs an energy source that is contained within the packer
 system 26 prior to disposing the string 22 into the borehole 12. An inner collar 84 is disposed
radially within an outer collar 86, and the chamber 61 is defined radially between the two
 collars 84, 86. The inner collar 84 may include or be operatively engaged with a compression
 portion 88 that lies in contact with the packer element 64. The electronic trigger 60 includes
 an actuator and a programmable electronic transceiver that is designed to receive a triggering
signal from the control line 50, inductive coupling device 40, EM telemetry, gap subs 28, all
as previously described. The actuator may be operably associated with setting piston 63 to
expose the setting piston 63 to hydrostatic pressure 62 upon receipt of the signal fiom the
transmitter, whether the transmitted signal is from the control line 50 and gap sub 28,
inductive coupling device 40, EM telemetry. The chamber 61 may be an atmospheric
chamber, which will create a pressure differential across the setting piston 63 due to its
exposure to the higher pressure hydrostatic pressure 62 which will urge the portion 88
operatively connected to the inner collar 84 toward the packer element 64 compressing it to a
set position filling the annulus 70 to the borehole wall 13 in the area of the packer element
64, enclosing the control line 50 therein. If desired., a delay could be incorporated into the
programming of the actuator of the e-trigger 60 such that a predetermined period of time
elapses between the tine the triggering signal is received by the e-trigger 60 and the setting
piston 63 is exposed to the hydrostatic pressure 62. When the setting piston 63 is exposed to
the hydrostatic pressure 62, the pressure differential will urge the inner collar 84 (and
associated compression portion 88) axially towards the packer element 64 so that the portion
88 will compress the packer element 64. The packer element 64 will be deformed radially
outwardly to seal against the borehole wall 13,
         [0040] One exemplary embodiment of a device 27 is shown in FIGS. 12A-12C. The
device 27, or frac sleeve system 27, includes both the first and second sleeve assemblies 54,
56, as shown in FIGS. 4-7, and thus the device 27 includes first and second electronic triggers
92, 94 to trigger movement of the first and second sleeve assemblies 54, 56, respectively. As
with the device 26, operational actions of this device 27 are accomplished by the introduction
of hydrostatic pressure 102, 104 which overcome first and second atmospheric chambers
96,98 on opposite sides of a setting piston or valve which moves the first and second sleeve
                                                 10

assemblies 54, 56. Also, in the embodiments of a device 27 described herein, the electronic
triggers 92, 94 of the device 27 are activatable from a radial exterior location 23 of the string
22 such as via induction, or from a toe of the string 22 to the electronic triggers 92, 94, such
as via the spliceless control line 50 and gap subs 28, as shown in FIGS. 1-3 and 10, to provide
the system 10 described herein with real time two way telemetry or data transmission. Via
the first and second atmospheric chambers 96, 98, and opposing introduction of hydrostatic
pressure 102, 104, the device 27 employs an energy source that is contained within the
system 10 and contains sufficient power to move the sleeves 54, 56 from first to second
positions with respect to the ports 72 of the string 22 prior to disposing the string 22 into the
borehole 12. FIG. 12A shows a run-in position where the first sleeve 54 is positioned to
cover the ports 72 in the string 22. When the first electronic trigger 92, which includes an
actuator and a programmable electronic transceiver receives a trigger signal, the actuator
exposes a piston or valve to allow hydrostatic pressure 102 to move the first sleeve 54 in the
position shown in FIG. 12B, exposing the ports 72 to the annulus 70. A fracturing treatment
or other injection operation May then be performed through the open ports 72, Turning now
to FIG. 12C, when it is time to close the ports 72, the second electronic trigger 94 receives a
triggering signal such that an actuator exposes a valve or piston having the atmospheric
chamber 98 on. one side, to hydrostatic pressure 104 on the other side, forcing the second
sleeve 56 into the closed position covering the ports 72.
         [0041] Another exemplary embodiment of a device 27 is shown in FIGS. 13A.-13C.
The device 27, or frac sleeve system 27, includes both the first and second sleeves 54, 56, as
shown in FIGS. 4-7, and thus the device 27 includes first and second electronic triggers 92,
94. The sleeve system of FIGS. 13A-1 3C is distinguished from the sleeve system of FIGS.
12A-12C by first and second intermediate auxiliary sleeves 106, 108, that are actuated by the
electronic triggers 92, 94 to engage with and move the respective first and second sleeves 54,
56. As with the device 26, operational actions ofthis device 27 are accomplished by
atmospheric chambers 110, 112 that are overcome by portions of the first and second
intermediate auxiliary sleeves 106, 108 that are acted upon by the introduction of hydrostatic
pressure 114 (FIG. 13B) and 116 (FIG. 13D). Also, in the embodiments of a device 27
described herein, the electronic triggers 92, 94 of the device 27 are activatable from a radial
exterior location 23 of the string 22. The device 27 thus employs an energy source that has
sufficient power to move the first and second sleeves 54, 56 and that is contained within the
system 10 prior to disposing the string 22 into the borehole 12.
                                                 11

         [0042] FIG. 13A shows a run-in position where the first sleeve 54 is positioned to
 cover the ports 72 in the string 22. Tuming to FIG. 13B, when the first electronic trigger 92,
 which includes an actuator and a programmable electronic transceiver that is designed to
 receive a triggering signal from the control line 50, or induction. or EM telemetry as
previously described, receives a trigger signal, the first intermediate auxiliary sleeve 106
moves to release the first sleeve 54. The first and second sleeves 54, 56 may be initially
 secured in their run-in position by shear pins that are sheared by forceful longitudinal
movement of the respective first and second intermediate auxiliary sleeves 106, 108. FIG.
 13C shows the first sleeve 54 moved to the position shown, leaving the ports 72 exposed. A
 fracturing treatment or other injection operation may then be performed through the open
ports 72. Turning now to FIG. 13D, when it is time to close the ports 72, the second
 electronic trigger 94 receives a triggering signal such that the second intermediate auxiliary
sleeve 108 moves to release the second sleeve 56, Borcing the second sleeve 56 into the
closed position covering the ports 72.
         [0043] In both the embodiments of the sleeve systems shown in FIGS. 12A-12C and
 FIGS. 13A-131D, the second sleeves 56 may further include the dissolvable insert 34 such that
production may be accomplished through the second sleeve 56 as previously described with
respect to FIG. 7.
         [0044] Thus, the systems 10 and 100 described herein enable a method of conducting
multi stage frac treatments in a well utilizing multiple sleeves 54, 56 that are self powered.
Communication methods include spliceless communication by induction from a control line,
communication by current flow from a control line extending past the downhole of the
devices and using gap subs for telemetry, and generation of EM signals using a control line at
the toe and gap subs. Frac treatments can be performed based on real time data from control
line 50 or fiber optic cable 52. No intervention is required for frac or production. No drill out
of ball seats is required and the systems 10, 100 disclosed herein allow for conventional
cementing since there are no ball seats to be fouled or protected from the cement.
