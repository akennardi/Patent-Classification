                                           FIELD OF THE INVENTION
             The present invention relates to methods and interfaces                                                      for
   interacting              with     computer-rendered                    models,          such       as      computer
 5 rendered models of anatomical surfaces.
                                                       BACKGROUND
             Three-dimensional                    surfaces            are        often          represented                 in
   computer          memory       by     a    contiguous             collection            of    tiles,           such      as
   triangular tiles.                   Such a representation may be referred to as                                            a
 0 "tesselation" or a                  "mesh."
             A     "geodesic        distance,"             with       respect          to    a    given         surface,
   between two points that lie on the surface, is the length of the
   shortest          path,      along      the      surface,         that       connects        the       two      points.
   For      points        lying      on     a    curved         surface,          this      distance           is     often
 5 different           from the         Euclidean           distance          between        the       points.            For
   example,           the      geodesic          distance           between           two     hilltops             is     the
   length        of   the     shortest         path that           runs,       along       the     surface          of    the
   Earth,        between        the     two     hilltops.              This      distance          is     larger        than
   the Euclidean distance between the hilltops,                                           which is the length
 0 of      a     straight         path,         through           the      air,        passing          between           the
   hilltops.

                                                 OVERVIEW
30       In     some       embodiments,              an      electroanatomical               map     of    a
   subject's       heart        is    constructed.                 As     implied        by      the   word
                                                        3

   "electroanatomical, "                     such       a    map       combines        anatomical             information
   relating to the                 structure of the heart with information relating
   to     the    electrical            activity             of    the     heart.         For       example,          the   map
   may     include         a   three-dimensional                      mesh,     representing               a   surface       of
 5 the       heart,          that         is        colored             (or     otherwise              annotated)            in
   accordance             with         local           activation             times           (LATs),          electrical
   potentials,              and/or           other          properties            that         were        measured          at
   various         locations            on      the       surface.             Such       a     mesh       is     typically
   constructed             from      a    large         number          of   data      points,           each      of    which
 0 corresponds            to     a   particular              location         on    the      surface          of   heart     at
   which       the     property           of      interest           was     measured.              The      mesh      may   be
   rendered         on      screen,         with       a    plurality           of    markers          indicating          the
   respective locations of the data points.
            In     some       cases,          a    user       may       wish     to     investigate,               discard,
 5 edit, or         otherwise process a cluster of data points located in a
   particular region                   of     interest.               To do     this,        the user must               first
   select       the      relevant          data        points,          by   selecting           the      corresponding
   markers on the screen.                           However, performing such a selection may
   be     tedious,          particularly               if     the       region       of     interest           contains        a
 0 large       number        of     data        points.            For      example,         traditional              "point
   and-click"           techniques              require          that      the    user       separately            click     on
   each       of      the       markers            that        corresponds             to       a     data        point      of

25 improved          techniques             for       selecting            data     points          belonging           to   an
   electroanatomical                  map.           In     some       embodiments,             the      user      performs
   an     extended mouse               click,         i.e.,        the     user     holds        a   mouse button            in
   a    clicked        position,            over       a    particular           point        of     interest          on  the
   map.        As    the      click       is     held,        a    contour        expands          outward         from the
30 particular            point,         such        that       all       points       on     the       contour         remain
   equidistant,               at      an        increasing               geodesic          distance,              from     the
   particular             point.                 As       the         contour         expands,             the        contour
   encapsulates              any      markers            that       it     crosses,          thus        selecting         the
   corresponding               data       points.              When        the    user        releases           the     mouse
                                                                   4

   button,          the       contour         stops      expanding,               and      properties            of      all        of
   the     selected data points                      are displayed.                     In this manner, a large
   number of data points may be selected relatively quickly.
            Moreover,             by     virtue         of     all       points           on    the       contour            being
 5 geodesically                 equidistant              from         the         point        of       interest,                 the
   selection              of   data      points         as    described              above       is     precise,             i.e.,
   the     selection             generally            achieves           a     result         that       is     similar             to
   that        which         would        have        been       achieved             had      the       user        manually
   clicked          on all        of    the markers             in    the        user's       region         of    interest.
 0 This      is     because         the      geodesic         distance            between        two      points         on the
   surface          of     the     heart        is     generally            correlated            to      the     amount            of
   time       required           for     bioelectric             signals            to    propagate            between            the
   two     points,           since       such       signals        travel           along      the      surface          of       the
   heart.                     Since,            typically,                  a         user            (such           as            an
 5 electrophysiologist)                       would         like       to        select        a      groups          of       data
   points         that       are    within         a  particular              propagation             time of          a     point
   of    interest,             selecting           data      points          according           to     their        geodesic
   distance               from      the       point         of       interest              achieves            the       user's
   objective.
 0           In     other       embodiments,              the      user        is     provided         with       a    virtual
   brush, which the user may move across the display, e.g.,                                                            using a
   mouse.            As     the     brush       moves       over       markers           that       are      displayed              on
   the map, the corresponding data points are selected.
             It       is      noted        that        embodiments                described            herein          may          be

   sort        of      three       dimensional             model         that         is     rendered           on     screen.
   Alternatively,                  embodiments              described               herein         may       be      used           to
   identify             a    region        of      the     model        that          is     within         a    particular
   geodesic             distance         of    a     point       of     interest,             without          necessarily

   of      a     surface         of      a      subject's           heart.            As      described            above,
 5 electroanatomical                map        30 may        be    constructed          from a         plurality         of
   data points,            each       of which may               be marked         by    a   respective           marker
   32     displayed         over       the       electroanatomical                 map.         As     described         in

   invention.
             First, as shown in the left portion of Fig. 2, processor                                                        22
   receives          a   positioning          input        36    from the           user.          For example,              as
 5 illustrated              in     Fig.      2,     positioning                input         36     may       include          a
   movement          of mouse 26.              In response              to positioning input                        36,    the
   processor           positions         a   cursor         39    over       a    particular             point       on    the
   displayed             three-dimensional                   electroanatomical                      map,         per       the
   positioning input.                   Alternatively,                 the processor may receive any
 0 other        suitable          type     of    positioning               input        (e.g.,        a    pressing          of
   arrow       keys      on      keyboard       28,     or     suitable           gestures          performed            on    a
   touch-screen              of    display       24),      and,       in    response           thereto,           position
   cursor        39,     or     any   other       suitable          indicator,             over      the      particular
   point indicated by the positioning input.
25           Subsequently,             the     user       begins         a    selecting           input        38,      e.g.,
   by     clicking           a    button       of     mouse        26,       or     by      pressing           a     key     on
   keyboard          28.         Then,     as    shown       in     the      middle         portion          of    Fig.      2,
   while        selecting           input      38      is     ongoing            (e.g.,        while         the      mouse
   button        click       is    held),      the     processor            expands          contour         34     along      a
30 surface         of     the      electroanatomical                 map,       such       that       all      points        on
   the       contour            remain      equidistant,                 at      an       increasing              geodesic

   processor            displays          the    contour         while     expanding         the      contour.           In
   some      embodiments,                while      the    contour        is     expanding,          the     user      may
   rotate          the      electroanatomical                 map,     zoom       in    to    or     out     from      the

            As      the       selecting          input       is     held,      the     processor           repeatedly

 5           In      some        embodiments,           the        speed       at    which       contour          34     is
   expanded            remains          fixed       during         the    expansion           of     the     contour.
   This      speed        may be         set    by    the     processor          in    response        to    a   speed
   indicating input                   from the user.                For example, the user may enter
   a    desired          contour-expansion                 speed      using        keyboard       28.        In    other
 0 embodiments,               the     speed      of    expansion         varies        during       the     expansion
   of      the       contour.                For     example,         the       speed      of     expansion            may
   increase            as      the      contour        grows        larger,         and/or      may       vary      as     a
   function           of    the      number      and/or         density      of markers          within        a   given
   area       that       lies       ahead      of     the      contour.           Thus,      for     example,          the
25 contour           may       expand        more      quickly        into        areas      of     the     map      that
   contain          relatively             few    markers,          and   less       quickly       into      areas       of
   the      map       that       contain        more      markers.             In     such     embodiments,              an
   initial          speed of expansion,                  a    rate     of acceleration              of expansion,
   and/or any other                   relevant parameters                 of the expansion may be set
30 by the processor in response to input                                   from the user.
             Finally,           as    shown     in    the right         portion of Fig.               2,    selecting

   the processor stops the expansion of contour 34.
                                                                 8

           Following           the      end    of      the      expansion          of     the      contour,          the
   processor         displays          one    or    more       properties           of    each      of    the      data
   points     that      is     marked by        a    respective           one     of markers           32   that        is
   inside         the       contour.              Alternatively                 or      additionally,                the

   expanding.           For example,           each time the contour passes,                             and hence
   encapsulates,             another        one      of      the      markers,          the      processor           may
   display       the    properties           of    the      data      point      that      is    marked       by     the
   newly-encapsulated marker.
 0         Reference           is     now    made        to     Fig.      3,     which         is   a    schematic
   cross-section              through        a    surface           41    on      which         contour        34       is
   located,        in      accordance          with         some      embodiments             of    the     present
   invention.
           The     cross-section             of    Fig.        3    "cuts      through"          contour        34      at
 5 two    points:         a    first       contour-point              42a,      and     a     second      contour
   point 42b.           As     noted      above,       all     of    the points           on    contour       34     are
   at    an    equal         geodesic         distance           from      point        40.         Thus,        first
   contour-point             42a     and    second         contour-point              42b     are    shown       lying
   at   an    equal      geodesic          distance          DG   from      point       40.        To   avoid any
 0 confusion, it is emphasized that a geodesic distance between two
   points      is    measured          along      the       surface       on     which        the    points        lie,
   and    may      therefore            be    different             from      the      Euclidean          distance
   between        the      points.           For      example,           in    Fig.       3,     the     Euclidean
   distance        DEl     between         point       40     and     second       contour-point              42b       is
25 less    than the          Euclidean         distance          DE2     between       point       40   and      first
   contour-point              42a,       despite          these       points          being       at     an      equal
   geodesic distance from point 40.
           In     general,          as   noted      above        in     the     Overview,          the    geodesic
   distance        between           two    points         on     the     surface         of      the    heart          is
30 correlated          to       the      amount        of      time       required            for     bioelectric
   signals       to propagate             between        the     two     points,        since      such      signals
   travel along the surface of the heart.                                    Hence, geodesic distance
   corresponds          to     the     manner       in     which       a   typical        user       (such      as      an

   positioning             step      48,      positions          an     indicator            over        a   particular

   Next,        at    a      selecting-input-receiving                           step       50,      the       processor

   checking            step      54,     whether        the      selecting            input       is      ongoing.              If
   yes,      the      processor          continues           expanding            the     contour.              Otherwise,
   at      a     stopping             step      56,      the       processor             stops         expanding              the
 5 contour.                 Finally,          at      a     property-displaying                        step         58,       the
   processor            displays         the      properties            of     the      selected           data       points.
    (As     noted         above,        property-displaying                     step       58    may         be     executed
   earlier, while the contour is expanding.)
             In     other        embodiments,            the      user      is     provided           with       a    virtual
 0 brush,          which        the     user       then       passes         over        the     model,            e.g.,        by
   dragging the brush with mouse 26.                                     As the brush passes over the
   model,         data       points       marked        by     the     markers           over      which         the      brush
   passes are             selected.            In some embodiments, the processor                                     colors,

   the user the data points that have been                                         selected.             While passing
   the brush over the model, the user may rotate the model, zoom in
   to    or      out      from      the    model,        or     otherwise           adjust        his        view       of    the
 0 model.
             The       processor          typically           positions            the      brush         above,         or     in
   front        of,     the model,          relative         to the         perspective             of the user who
   is    viewing            the     screen        of    display          24.         As     the      user        moves        the
   brush across               the     model,       the     processor            projects         a     virtual          three
25 dimensional               object      from       the    brush        "into"         the      screen,          such       that
   the     object          intersects          the      surface         of     the     model.            The      processor
   identifies             the      area     of    the     surface          over      which       the        intersection
   occurs,           and       then      selects         any      data        points          whose         markers           are
   within         this       area.         For      example,          as     the      user       moves         a    circular
30 brush across the screen, the processor may compute the area over
   which a virtual cylinder projected from the brush intersects the
   surface          of the        model,       and may         then      select         any     data       points whose
   markers are within this area.
