DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE DISCLOSURE
        The present disclosure is directed to catalyst systems to release energy from atomic
hydrogen to form lower energy states wherein the electron shell is at a closer position relative
to the nucleus. The released power is harnessed for power generation and additionally new
hydrogen species and compounds are desired products. These energy states are predicted by
classical physical laws and require a catalyst to accept energy from the hydrogen in order to
undergo the corresponding energy-releasing transition.
        Classical physics gives closed-form solutions of the hydrogen atom, the hydride ion,
the hydrogen molecular ion, and the hydrogen molecule and predicts corresponding species
having fractional principal quantum numbers. Using Maxwell's equations, the structure of
the electron was derived as a boundary-value problem wherein the electron comprises the
source current of time-varying electromagnetic fields during transitions with the constraint
that the bound n =1 state electron cannot radiate energy.        A reaction predicted by the
solution of the H atom involves a resonant, nonradiative energy transfer from otherwise
stable atomic hydrogen to a catalyst capable of accepting the energy to form hydrogen in
lower-energy states than previously thought possible. Specifically, classical physics predicts
that atomic hydrogen may undergo a catalytic reaction with certain atoms, excimers, ions,
and diatomic hydrides which provide a reaction with a net enthalpy of an integer multiple of
the potential energy of atomic hydrogen, Eh = 27.2 eV where Eh is one Hartree. Specific
species (e.g. He+, Arm, Sr+, K, Li, HCl, and NaH, OH, SH, SeH, nascent H20, nH (n=integer))

identifiable on the basis of their known electron energy levels are required to be present with
atomic hydrogen to catalyze the process. The reaction involves a nonradiative energy
transfer followed by q.13.6 eV continuum emission or q.13.6 eV transfer to H to form
extraordinarily hot, excited-state H and a hydrogen atom that is lower in energy than
unreacted atomic hydrogen that corresponds to a fractional principal quantum number. That
is, in the formula for the principal energy levels of the hydrogen atom:

replace the well known parameter n = integer in the Rydberg equation for hydrogen excited
states and represent lower-energy-state hydrogen atoms called "hydrinos." Then, similar to
an excited state having the analytical solution of Maxwell's equations, a hydrino atom also
comprises an electron, a proton, and a photon.          However, the electric field of the latter
increases the binding corresponding to desorption of energy rather than decreasing the central
field with the absorption of energy as in an excited state, and the resultant photon-electron
interaction of the hydrino is stable rather than radiative.
                                                        1
         The n = 1 state of hydrogen and the n =             states of hydrogen are nonradiative,
                                                    integer
but a transition between two nonradiative states, say n =1 to n = 1/2, is possible via a
nonradiative energy transfer. Hydrogen is a special case of the stable states given by Eqs. (1)
and (3) wherein the corresponding radius of the hydrogen or hydrino atom is given by
          r= aH                                                                               (4)
               p
where p      =1,2,3,....   In order to conserve energy, energy must be transferred from the
hydrogen atom to the catalyst in units of
          m -27.2 eV, m = 1,2,3,4,....                                                        (5)
and the radius transitions to        aH . The catalyst reactions involve two steps of energy
                                   m+p
release: a nonradiative energy transfer to the catalyst followed by additional energy release as
the radius decreases to the corresponding stable final state. It is believed that the rate of
catalysis is increased as the net enthalpy of reaction is more closely matched to m -27.2 e V.
It has been found that catalysts having a net enthalpy of reaction within ±10%, preferably
 ±5%,    of m-27.2 eV are suitable for most applications.         In the case of the catalysis of
hydrino atoms to lower energy states, the enthalpy of reaction of m -27.2 eV (Eq. (5)) is
relativistically corrected by the same factor as the potential energy of the hydrino atom.

acceptance of the resonant energy transfer regards the potential energy rather than the
ionization energy. Conservation of energy gives a proton of the kinetic energy corresponding
to one half the potential energy in the former case and a catalyst ion at essentially rest in the
latter case. The H recombination radiation of the fast protons gives rise to broadened Balmer
 a emission that is disproportionate to the inventory of hot hydrogen consistent with the
excess power balance.
         In the present disclosure the terms such as hydrino reaction, H catalysis, H catalysis
reaction, catalysis when referring to hydrogen, the reaction of hydrogen to form hydrinos, and
hydrino formation reaction all refer to the reaction such as that of Eqs. (6-9)) of a catalyst
defined by Eq. (5) with atomic H to form states of hydrogen having energy levels given by
Eqs. (1) and (3).         The corresponding terms such as hydrino reactants, hydrino reaction
mixture, catalyst mixture, reactants for hydrino formation, reactants that produce or form
lower-energy state hydrogen or hydrinos are also used interchangeably when referring to the
                                                       21

reaction mixture that performs the catalysis of H to H states or hydrino states having energy
levels given by Eqs. (1) and (3).
          The catalytic lower-energy hydrogen transitions of the present disclosure require a
catalyst that may be in the form of an endothermic chemical reaction of an integer m of the
potential energy of uncatalyzed atomic hydrogen, 27.2 eV, that accepts the energy from
atomic H to cause the transition. The endothermic catalyst reaction may be the ionization of
one or more electrons from a species such as an atom or ion (e.g. m = 3 for Li -        Li 24 ) and
may further comprise the concerted reaction of a bond cleavage with ionization of one or
more electrons from one or more of the partners of the initial bond (e.g. m = 2 for
 NaH -> Na2 * + H). He fulfills the catalyst criterion-a chemical or physical process with
an enthalpy change equal to an integer multiple of 27.2 eV since it ionizes at 54.417 eV,
which is 2.27.2 eV. An integer number of hydrogen atoms may also serve as the catalyst of
an integer multiple of 27.2 eV enthalpy. Hydrogen atoms H(1/p) p = 1,2,3,...137 can
undergo further transitions to lower-energy states given by Eqs. (1) and (3) wherein the
transition of one atom is catalyzed by one or more additional H atoms that resonantly and
nonradiatively accepts m-27.2 eV with a concomitant opposite change in its potential
energy. The overall general equation for the transition of H (1/ p) to H (1/ (p + m))
induced by a resonance transfer of m -27.2 eV to H (1/ p') is represented by
           H(1/p')+H(1/p)->H+H(1/(p+m))+[2pm+M2                    __,2+1 -13.6 eV             (10)
Hydrogen atoms may serve as a catalyst wherein m =1, m = 2, and m           = 3 for one, two, and
three atoms, respectively, acting as a catalyst for another. The rate for the two-atom-catalyst,
 2H, may be high when extraordinarily fast H collides with a molecule to form the 2H
wherein two atoms resonantly and nonradiatively accept 54.4 eV from a third hydrogen atom
of the collision partners. By the same mechanism, the collision of two hot H2 provide 3H to
serve as a catalyst of 3.27.2 eV for the fourth. The EUV continua at 22.8 nm and 10.1 nm,
extraordinary (>100 eV) Balmer a line broadening, highly excited H states, the product gas
 H 2 (1 / 4), and large energy release is observed consistent with predictions.
          H(1/4) is a preferred hydrino state based on its multipolarity and the selection rules
for its formation. Thus, in the case that H(1/3) is formed, the transition to H(1/4) may occur
rapidly catalyzed by H according to Eq. (10).        Similarly, H(1/4) is a preferred state for a
catalyst energy greater than or equal to 81.6 eV corresponding to m=3 in Eq. (5). In this case
the energy transfer to the catalyst comprises the 81.6 eV that forms that H*(1/4) intermediate
of Eq. (7) as well as an integer of 27.2 eV from the decay of the intermediate. For example, a
catalyst having an enthalpy of 108.8 eV may form H*(1/4) by accepting 81.6 eV as well as
27.2 eV from the H*(1/4) decay energy of 122.4 eV. The remaining decay energy of 95.2 eV
is released to the environment to form the preferred state H(1/4) that then reacts to form
H2(1/4).
                                                 22

         A suitable catalyst can therefore provide a net positive enthalpy of reaction of
 m-27.2 eV. That is, the catalyst resonantly accepts the nonradiative energy transfer from
hydrogen atoms and releases the energy to the surroundings to affect electronic transitions to
fractional quantum energy levels. As a consequence of the nonradiative energy transfer, the
hydrogen atom becomes unstable and emits further energy until it achieves a lower-energy
nonradiative state having a principal energy level given by Eqs. (1) and (3).                 Thus, the
catalysis releases energy from the hydrogen atom with a commensurate decrease in size of
the hydrogen atom, r, = na where n is given by Eq. (3). For example, the catalysis of
 H(n = 1) to H(n = 1/4) releases 204 eV, and the hydrogen radius decreases from aH to
  1
 -aH.

disproportionation wherein H or H(1/p) serves as the catalyst for another H or H(1/p') (p may
equal p').
        Hydrogen and hydrinos may serves as catalysts.                     Hydrogen atoms
 H(1/p) p = 1,2,3,...137 can undergo transitions to lower-energy states given by Eqs. (1)
and (3) wherein the transition of one atom is catalyzed by a second that resonantly and
nonradiatively accepts m -27.2 eV with a concomitant opposite change in its potential
energy. The overall general equation for the transition of H(1/p) to H(1/(m+p))
induced by a resonance transfer of m -27.2 eV to H (1/ p') is represented by Eq. (10). Thus,
hydrogen atoms may serve as a catalyst wherein m = 1, m = 2, and m = 3 for one, two, and
three atoms, respectively, acting as a catalyst for another. The rate for the two- or three
atom-catalyst case would be appreciable only when the H density is high. But, high H
densities are not uncommon. A high hydrogen atom concentration permissive of 2H or 3H
serving as the energy acceptor for a third or fourth may be achieved under several
circumstances such as on the surface of the Sun and stars due to the temperature and gravity
driven density, on metal surfaces that support multiple monolayers, and in highly dissociated
plasmas, especially pinched hydrogen plasmas. Additionally, a three-body H interaction is
easily achieved when two H atoms arise with the collision of a hot H with H 2 . This event
can commonly occur in plasmas having a large population of extraordinarily fast H. This is
evidenced by the unusual intensity of atomic H emission. In such cases, energy transfer can
occur from a hydrogen atom to two others within sufficient proximity, being typically a few
angstroms via multipole coupling. Then, the reaction between three hydrogen atoms whereby
two atoms resonantly and nonradiatively accept 54.4 eV from the third hydrogen atom such

The extreme-ultraviolet continuum radiation band due to the H *                intermediate of Eq.

called "hydrino" states, was observed only arising from pulsed pinched hydrogen discharges
first at BlackLight Power, Inc. (BLP) and reproduced at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics
(CfA). Continuum radiation in the 10 to 30 nm region that matched predicted transitions of
H to hydrino states, were observed only arising from pulsed pinched hydrogen discharges
with metal oxides that are thermodynamically favorable to undergo H reduction to form HOH
catalyst; whereas, those that are unfavorable did not show any continuum even though the
low-melting point metals tested are very favorable to forming metal ion plasmas with strong
short-wavelength continua in more powerful plasma sources.
         Alternatively, a resonant kinetic energy transfer to form fast H may occur consistent
with the observation of extraordinary Balmer a line broadening corresponding to high
kinetic energy H. The energy transfer to two H also causes pumping of the catalyst excited
states, and fast H is produced directly as given by exemplary Eqs. (24), (28), and (47) and
by resonant kinetic energy transfer.

catalysis reaction of the present disclosure. The binding energy of an atom, ion, or molecule,
also known as the ionization energy, is the energy required to remove one electron from the
atom, ion or molecule. A hydrogen atom having the binding energy given in Eq. (34) is
hereafter referred to as a "hydrino atom" or "hydrino."        The designation for a hydrino of
radius aH ,where a H is the radius of an ordinary hydrogen atom and p is an integer, is

H aH. A hydrogen atom with a radius aH is hereinafter referred to as "ordinary hydrogen
      p _

energy of 13.6 eV.
         Hydrinos are formed by reacting an ordinary hydrogen atom with a suitable catalyst
having a net enthalpy of reaction of
         m -27.2 eV                                                                          (35)
where m is an integer. It is believed that the rate of catalysis is increased as the net enthalpy
of reaction is more closely matched to m -27.2 eV. It has been found that catalysts having a
net enthalpy of reaction within ±10%, preferably      ±5%,   of m -27.2 eV are suitable for most
applications.

         This catalysis releases energy from the hydrogen atom with a commensurate decrease
in size of the hydrogen atom, , = naH. For example, the catalysis of H(n = 1) to
 H(n  =1/  2) releases 40.8 eV, and the hydrogen radius decreases from aH to -aH. A

catalytic system is provided by the ionization of t electrons from an atom each to a
continuum energy level such that the sum of the ionization energies of the t electrons is
approximately m -27.2 eV where m is an integer. As a power source, the energy given off
during catalysis is much greater than the energy lost to the catalyst. The energy released is
large as compared to conventional chemical reactions.           For example, when hydrogen and
oxygen gases undergo combustion to form water
         H2   (g) -0   2 (g) -> H 2 0 (1)                                                    (36)

the known enthalpy of formation of water is AHf = -286 U / mole or 1.48 eV per hydrogen
atom. By contrast, each (n = 1) ordinary hydrogen atom undergoing catalysis releases a net
                                                                         1   1 1     1 1        1

and so on.       Once catalysis begins, hydrinos autocatalyze further in a process called
disproportionation. This mechanism is similar to that of an inorganic ion catalysis. But,
hydrino catalysis should have a higher reaction rate than that of the inorganic ion catalyst due
to the better match of the enthalpy to m -27.2 eV.

 m -27.2 eV where m is an integer to produce a hydrino (whereby t electrons are ionized

transfer reaction, the breakage of the OH bond, and the double ionization of 0 is 54.27 eV as
given in the eleventh column, and m = 2 in Eq. (35) as given in the twelfth column. In other
embodiments, the catalyst for H to form hydrinos is provided by the ionization of a negative

approximately m .27.2 eV where m is an integer. Alternatively, the first electron of the

         In other embodiments, MH type hydrogen catalysts to produce hydrinos are provided
by the transfer of an electron from an donor A which may be negatively charged, the
breakage of the M-H bond, and the ionization of t electrons from the atom M each to a
continuum energy level such that the sum of the electron transfer energy comprising the
difference of ionization energies of MH and A, bond M-H energy, and ionization energies of
the t electrons from M is approximately m .27.2 eV where m is an integer.

         In an embodiment, a species such as an atom, ion, or molecule serves as a catalyst to
cause molecular hydrogen to undergo a transition to molecular hydrino H2 (1/p) (p is an
integer). Similarly to the case with H the catalyst accepts energy from H2 which in this case
may be about m48.6 eV wherein m is an integer as given in Mills GUTCP.                   Suitable
exemplary catalysts that form H2(1/p) by the direct catalysis of H 2 are 0, V, and Cd that form
02+,  V4*, and Cd"+during the catalysis reaction corresponding to m = 1, m = 2, and m = 4 ,
respectively. The energy may be released as heat or light or as electricity wherein the
reactions comprise a half-cell reaction.
         In an embodiment, the catalyst comprises any species such as an atom, positively or
negatively charged ion, positively or negatively charged molecular ion, molecule, excimer,
compound, or any combination thereof in the ground or excited state that is capable of
accepting energy of m-27.2 eV, m = 1,2,3,4,....(Eq. (5)). It is believed that the rate of
catalysis is increased as the net enthalpy of reaction is more closely matched to m -27.2 e V.
It has been found that catalysts having a net enthalpy of reaction within ±10%, preferably
 ±5%,   of m-27.2 eV are suitable for most applications.         In the case of the catalysis of
hydrino atoms to lower energy states, the enthalpy of reaction of m -27.2 eV (Eq. (5)) is
relativistically corrected by the same factor as the potential energy of the hydrino atom. In an
embodiment, the catalyst resonantly and radiationless accepts energy from atomic hydrogen.
In an embodiment, the accepted energy decreases the magnitude of the potential energy of the
catalyst by about the amount transferred from atomic hydrogen. Energetic ions or electrons
may result due to the conservation of the kinetic energy of the initially bound electrons. At
least one atomic H serves as a catalyst for at least one other wherein the 27.2 eV potential
energy of the acceptor is cancelled by the transfer or 27.2 eV from the donor H atom being
catalyzed. The kinetic energy of the acceptor catalyst H may be conserved as fast protons or
electrons. Additionally, the intermediate state (Eq. (7)) formed in the catalyzed H decays
with the emission of continuum energy in the form of radiation or induced kinetic energy in a
third body. These energy releases may result in current flow in the CIHT cell.
         In an embodiment, at least one of a molecule or positively or negatively charged
molecular ion serves as a catalyst that accepts about m27.2 eV from atomic H with a decrease
in the magnitude of the potential energy of the molecule or positively or negatively charged
molecular ion by about m27.2 eV. For example, the potential energy of H2 0 given in Mills
GUTCP is

A molecule that accepts m - 27.2 eV from atomic H with a decrease in the magnitude of the

                                  4_
of H. As the electron undergoes radial acceleration from the radius of the hydrogen atom to a
radius of 1/4 this distance, energy is released as characteristic light emission or as third-body
kinetic energy. Based on the 10% energy change in the heat of vaporization in going from
ice at 00 C to water at 100 0 C, the average number of H bonds per water molecule in boiling
water is 3.6. Thus, in an embodiment, H20 must be formed chemically as isolated molecules
with suitable activation energy in order to serve as a catalyst to form hydrinos.            In an
embodiment, the H20 catalyst is nascent H 2 0.
        In an embodiment, at least one of nH, 0, nO, 02, OH, and H20 (n = integer) may
serve as the catalyst. The product of H and OH as the catalyst may be H(1/5) wherein the
catalyst enthalpy is about 108.8 eV. The product of the reaction of H and H2 0 as the catalyst
may be H(1/4). The hydrino product may further react to lower states. The product of H(1/4)
and H as the catalyst may be H(1/5) wherein the catalyst enthalpy is about 27.2 eV. The
product of H(1/4) and OH as the catalyst may be H(1/6) wherein the catalyst enthalpy is
about 54.4 eV. The product of H(1/5) and H as the catalyst may be H(1/6) wherein the
catalyst enthalpy is about 27.2 eV.
        Additionally, OH may serve as a catalyst since the potential energy of OH is
        V= (3          -2e 2         a+ a 2 -b 2 = -40.92709 eV                               (48)

The difference in energy between the H states p = 1 and p = 2 is 40.8 eV. Thus, OH may
accept about 40.8 eV from H to serve as a catalyst to form H(1/2).
        Similarly to H2 0, the potential energy of the amide functional group NH 2 given in
Mills GUTCP is -78.77719 eV. From the CRC, AH for the reaction of NH 2 to form KNH 2
calculated from each corresponding AHf is (-128.9-184.9) kJ/mole = -313.8 kJ/mole (3.25
eV). From the CRC, AH for the reaction of NH 2 to form NaNH 2 calculated from each
corresponding AHf is (-123.8-184.9) kJ/mole = -308.7 kJ/mole (3.20 eV). From the CRC,
 AH for the reaction of NH 2 to form LiNH 2 calculated from each corresponding AHf is (
 179.5-184.9) kJ/mole     =  -364.4 kJ/mole (3.78 eV). Thus, the net enthalpy that may be
                                                43

accepted by alkali amides MNH 2 (M = K, Na, Li) serving as H catalysts to form hydrinos are
about 82.03 eV, 81.98 eV, and 82.56 eV (m=3 in Eq. (5)), respectively, corresponding to the
sum of the potential energy of the amide group and the energy to form the amide from the
amide group. The hydrino product such as molecular hydrino may cause an upfield matrix
shift observed by means such as MAS NMR.
        Similarly to H 2 0, the potential energy of the H 2 S functional group given in Mills
GUTCP is -72.81 eV. The cancellation of this potential energy also eliminates the energy
associated with the hybridization of the 3p shell. This hybridization energy of 7.49 eV is
given by the ratio of the hydride orbital radius and the initial atomic orbital radius times the
total energy of the shell. Additionally, the energy change of the S3p shell due to forming the
two S-H bonds of 1.10 eV is included in the catalyst energy. Thus, the net enthalpy of H2 S
catalyst is 81.40 eV (m=3 in Eq. (5)). H2 S catalyst may be formed from MHS (M = alkali)
by the reaction
        2MHS to M 2 S + H2 S                                                                (49)
This reversible reaction may form H 2 S in an active catalytic state in the transition state to
product H2 S that may catalyze H to hydrino. The reaction mixture may comprise reactants
that form H2 S and a source of atomic H. The hydrino product such as molecular hydrino may
cause an upfield matrix shift observed by means such as MAS NMR.
        Furthermore, atomic oxygen is a special atom with two unpaired electrons at the same
radius equal to the Bohr radius of atomic hydrogen. When atomic H serves as the catalyst,
27.2 eV of energy is accepted such that the kinetic energy of each ionized H serving as a
catalyst for another is 13.6 eV. Similarly, each of the two electrons of 0 can be ionized with
 13.6 eV of kinetic energy transferred to the 0 ion such that the net enthalpy for the breakage
of the O-H bond of OH with the subsequent ionization of the two outer unpaired electrons is
80.4 eV as given in TABLE 3. During the ionization of OH- to OH, the energy match for the
further reaction to H(1/4) and     02   + 2e- may occur wherein the 204 eV of energy released
contributes to the CIHT cell's electrical power. The reaction is given as follows:

such as FTIR, Raman, and XPS are given in the disclosure.
         In an embodiment wherein oxygen or a compound comprising oxygen participates in
the oxidation or reduction reaction,   02 may serve as a catalyst or a source of a catalyst. The
bond energy of the oxygen molecule is 5.165 eV, and the first, second, and third ionization
energies of an oxygen atom are 13.61806 eV, 35.11730 eV, and 54.9355 eV, respectively.
The reactions 02 > 0 +02, 02 -> 0 + 0", and 20 -> 2O provide a net enthalpy of about
2, 4, and 1 times Eh, respectively, and comprise catalyst reactions to form hydrino by
accepting these energies from H to cause the formation of hydrinos.
IX. Fuel Cell and Battery
         An embodiment of the fuel cell and a battery 400 is shown in FIGURE 1. The
hydrino reactants comprising a solid fuel or a heterogeneous catalyst comprise the reactants
for corresponding cell half reactions. A catalyst-induced-hydrino-transition (CIHT) cell is
enabled by the unique attributes of the catalyzed hydrino transition. The CIHT cell of the
present disclosure is a hydrogen fuel cell that generates an electromotive force (EMF) from
the catalytic reaction of hydrogen to lower energy (hydrino) states. Thus, it serves as a fuel
cell for the direct conversion of the energy released from the hydrino reaction into electricity.
         Due to oxidation-reduction cell half reactions, the hydrino-producing reaction mixture
is constituted with the migration of electrons through an external circuit and ion mass
transport through a separate path to complete an electrical circuit. The overall reactions and
corresponding reaction mixtures that produce hydrinos given by the sum of the half-cell
reactions may comprise the reaction types considered for thermal power production given in
the present disclosure.     The free energy AG from the hydrino reaction gives rise to a
potential that may be an oxidation or reduction potential depending on the oxidation
reduction chemistry to constitute the hydrino-producing reaction mixture. The potential may
be used to generate a voltage in a fuel cell. The potential V may be expressed in terms of the
free energy AG:
         V =_                                                                                (53)
               nF
wherein F is the Faraday constant. Given the free energy is about -20 MJ/mole H for the
transition to H(1/4), the voltage may be high depending on the other cell components such as
the chemicals, electrolyte, and electrodes. In an embodiment wherein the voltage is limited
by the oxidation-reduction potentials of these or other components, the energy may be
manifest as a higher current and corresponding power contribution from hydrino formation.
As indicated by Eqs. (6-9), the energy of the hydrino transition may be released as
continuum radiation. Specifically, energy is transferred to the catalyst nonradiatively to form
a metastable intermediate, which decays in plasma systems with the emission of continuum
                                                45

radiation as the electron translates from the initial to final radius. In condensed matter such
as the CIHT cell, this energy may internally convert into energetic electrons manifest as a cell
current and power contribution at potentials similar to the chemical potential of the cell
reactants. Thus, the power may manifest as higher current at lower voltage than that given by
Eq. (53). The voltage will also be limited by the kinetics of the reaction; so, high kinetics to
form hydrinos is favorable to increase the power by increasing at least one of the current and
voltage. Since the cell reaction may be driven by the large exothermic reaction of H with a
catalyst to form hydrino, in an embodiment, the free energy of the conventional oxidation
reduction cell reactions to form the reactants to form hydrinos may be any value possible.
Suitable ranges are about +1000 kJ/mole to -1000 kJ/mole, about +1000 U/mole to -100
kJ/mole, about +1000 kJ/mole to -10 kJ/mole, and about +1000 kJ/mole to 0 kJ/mole. Due to
negative free energy to form hydrinos, at least one of the cell current, voltage, and power are
higher than those due to the free energy of the non-hydrino reactions that can contribute to
the current, voltage, and power. This applies to the open circuit voltage and that with a load.
Thus, in an embodiment, the CIHT cell is distinguished over any prior Art by at least one of
having a voltage higher than that predicted by the Nernst equation for the non-hydrino related
chemistry including the correction of the voltage due to any polarization voltage when the
cell is loaded, a higher current than that driven by convention chemistry, and a higher power
than that driven by conventional chemistry.
         Regarding FIGURE 1, the fuel or CIHT cell 400 comprises a cathode compartment
401 with a cathode 405, an anode compartment 402 with an anode 410, a salt bridge 420,
reactants that constitute hydrino reactants during cell operation with separate electron flow
and ion mass transport, and a source of hydrogen. In general embodiments, the CIHT cell is
a hydrogen fuel cell that generates an electromotive force (EMF) from the catalytic reaction
of hydrogen to lower energy (hydrino) states. Thus, it serves as a fuel cell for the direct
conversion of the energy released from the hydrino reaction into electricity.        In another
embodiment, the CIHT cell produces at least one of electrical and thermal power gain over
that of an applied electrolysis power through the electrodes 405 and 410. The cell consumes
hydrogen in forming hydrinos and requires hydrogen addition; otherwise, in an embodiment,
the reactants to form hydrinos are at least one of thermally or electrolytically regenerative.
Different reactants or the same reactants under different states or conditions such as at least
one of different temperature, pressure, and concentration are provided in different cell
compartments that are connected by separate conduits for electrons and ions to complete an
electrical circuit between the compartments. The potential and electrical power gain between
electrodes of the separate compartments or thermal gain of the system is generated due to the
dependence of the hydrino reaction on mass flow from one compartment to another. The
mass flow provides at least one of the formation of the reaction mixture that reacts to produce
hydrinos and the conditions that permit the hydrino reaction to occur at substantial rates. The
                                                46

mass flow further requires that electrons and ions be transported in the separate conduits that
connect the compartments. The electrons may arise from at least one of the ionization of the
catalyst during the reaction of atomic hydrogen with the catalyst and by an oxidation or
reduction reaction of a reactant species such as an atom, a molecule, a compound, or a metal.
The ionization of the species in a compartment such as the anode compartment 402 may be
due to at least one of (1) the favorable free energy change from its oxidation, the reduction of
a reactant species in the separate compartment such as the cathode 401, and the reaction of
the migrating ion that balances charge in the compartments to electroneutrality and (2) the
free energy change due to hydrino formation due to the oxidation of the species, the reduction
of a species in the separate compartment, and the reaction of the migrating ion that results in
the reaction to form hydrinos. The migration of the ion may be through the salt bridge 420.
In another embodiment, the oxidation of the species, the reduction of a species in the separate
compartment, and the reaction of the migrating ion may not be spontaneous or may occur at a
low rate. An electrolysis potential is applied to force the reaction wherein the mass flow
provides at least one of the formation of the reaction mixture that reacts to produce hydrinos
and the conditions that permit the hydrino reaction to occur at substantial rates.           The
electrolysis potential may be applied through the external circuit 425. The reactants of each
half-cell may be at least one of supplied, maintained, and regenerated by addition of reactants
or removal of products through passages 460 and 461 to sources of reactants or reservoirs for
product storage and regeneration 430 and 431.
         In an embodiment, at least one of the atomic hydrogen and the hydrogen catalyst may
be formed by a reaction of the reaction mixture and one reactant that by virtue of it
undergoing a reaction causes the catalysis to be active. The reactions to initiate the hydrino
reaction may be at least one of exothermic reactions, coupled reactions, free radical reactions,
oxidation-reduction reactions, exchange reactions, and getter, support, or matrix-assisted
catalysis reactions.      In an embodiment,        the reaction to form hydrinos provides
electrochemical power. The reaction mixtures and reactions to initiate the hydrino reaction
such as the exchange reactions of the present disclosure are the basis of a fuel cell wherein
electrical power is developed by the reaction of hydrogen to form hydrinos.               Due to
oxidation-reduction cell half reactions, the hydrino-producing reaction mixture is constituted
with the migration of electrons through an external circuit and ion mass transport through a
separate path to complete an electrical circuit.      The overall reactions and corresponding
reaction mixtures that produce hydrinos given by the sum of the half-cell reactions may
comprise the reaction types for thermal power and hydrino chemical production of the
present disclosure. Thus, ideally, the hydrino reaction does not occur or does not occur at an
appreciable rate in the absence of the electron flow and ion mass transport.
         The cell comprises at least a source of catalyst or a catalyst and a source of hydrogen
or hydrogen. A suitable catalyst or source of catalyst and a source of hydrogen are those of
                                                47

the disclosure such as H2 0.     In an embodiment, a species may undergo reduction at the
cathode. The species may be a source of the catalyst by at least one of reduction and reaction
at the cathode.     In an embodiment, an oxidant undergoes reaction to form the hydrino
reactants that then react to form hydrinos. Alternatively, the final electron-acceptor reactants
comprise an oxidant. The oxidant or cathode-cell reaction mixture may be located in the
cathode compartment 401 having cathode 405.            Alternatively, the cathode-cell reaction
mixture is constituted in the cathode compartment from ion and electron migration. In one
embodiment of the fuel cell, the cathode compartment 401 functions as the cathode. During
operation, a positive ion may migrate from the anode to the cathode compartment. In certain
embodiments, this migration occurs through a salt bridge 420. Alternatively, a negative ion
may migrate from the cathode to anode compartment through a salt bridge 420.                The
migrating ion may be at least one of an ion of the catalyst or source of catalyst, an ion of
hydrogen such as H+, H-, or H- (1/p), and the counterion of the compound formed by
reaction of the catalyst or source of catalyst with the oxidant or anion of the oxidant. Each
cell reaction may be at least one of supplied, maintained, and regenerated by addition of

electrolysis cathode and anode may be a CIHT cell anode and cathode where the roles are
reversed in switching from CIHT to electrolysis cell and back again after the cell is

frequencies are within the range of about 1 to about 1000 Hz and the duty cycle may be about
0.001% to about 95% but may be within narrower ranges of factor of two increments within
this range. In an embodiment, the cell is maintained at an optimal run high frequency to
minimize the input energy to make a monolayer of H that reacts to hydrinos during the
discharge phase. The peak voltage per cell may be within the range of at least one of about
0.1 V to 10 V, but may be within narrower ranges of a factor of two increments within this
range. In another embodiment, a high voltage pulse is applied that may in the range of about

decrease the charge-transfer resistance.
        In an embodiment, reactants that may be short lived are generated during electrolysis
that result in the formation of hydrinos and corresponding electrical power during the CIHT
cell discharge phase of a repeated cycle of charge and discharge. The electrolysis power may
be applied to optimize the energy from the formation of hydrinos relative to the input energy.
The electrolysis conditions of voltage, waveform, duty cell, frequency and other such
parameters may be adjusted to increase the electrical energy gain from the cell.
        In an embodiment, the hydrogen electrode, and optionally the oxygen electrode, is
replaced by an element of a bipolar plate 507 as shown in FIGURE 2. The cell design may
be based on a planar square geometrical configuration wherein the cells may be stacked to
                                               52

build voltage. Each cell may form a repeating unit comprising an anode current collector,
porous anode, electrolyte matrix, porous cathode, and cathode current collector. One cell
may be separated from the next by a separator that may comprise a bipolar plate that serves
as both the gas separator and series current collector. The plate may have a cross-flow gas
configuration or internal manifolding. As shown in FIGURE 2, interconnections or bipolar
plates 507 separate the anode 501 from the adjacent cathode 502 in a CIHT cell stack 500
comprising a plurality of individual CIHT cells.         The anode or H2 plate 504 may be
corrugated or comprise channels 505 that distribute hydrogen supplied through ports 503.
The plate 504 with channels 505 substitutes for the hydrogen permeable membrane or
intermittent electrolysis cathode (discharge anode) of other embodiments.         The ports may
receive hydrogen from a manifold along the ports 503 that are in turn is supplied by a
hydrogen source such as a tank. The plate 504 may further ideally evenly distribute hydrogen
to bubble or sparge into active areas wherein electrochemical reactions occur. The bipolar
plate may further comprise an oxygen plate of the bipolar plate having a similar structure as
that of the H2 plate to distribute oxygen to active areas wherein an oxygen manifold supplies
oxygen from a supply along oxygen ports 506. These corrugated or channeled plates are
electrically conducting and are connected with anode and cathode current collectors in the
active areas and maintain electrical contact. In an embodiment, all the interconnection or
bipolar plates constitute the gas distribution network allowing separation of anodic and
cathodic gasses. Wet seals may be formed by extension of the electrolyte/matrix such as
LiOH-LiBr/Li 2TiO 3 or MgO tile pressed between two individual plates.           The seals may
prevent leakage of the reactant gases. The electrolyte may comprise a pressed pellet of the
disclosure. The pressure to form an electrolyte pellet such as one comprising a hydroxide
such as an alkali hydroxide such as LiOH and a halide such an alkali halide such as LiBr and
a matrix such as MgO is in the range of about 1 to 500 tons per square inch. The stack may
further comprise tie rods that hold pressure plates at the ends of the stack to apply pressure to
the cells to maintain a desire contact between the electrolyte such as a pellet electrolyte and
the electrodes. In an embodiment wherein the electrolyte or a component such as a hydroxide
such as LiOH migrates by means such as evaporation, the electrolyte may be collected and
recycled. The migrating species may be collected in a structure such as a collecting structure
or a wicking structure that absorbs the electrolyte, and the recycling may be achieved
thermally by means such as heating the collecting or wicking structure to cause a reverse
migration.
         The CIHT cell system may comprise a modified conventional fuel cell such as a
modified alkaline or molten carbonate-type. In an embodiment, the CIHT cell comprises a
stack of bipolar plates such as shown in FIGURE 2 wherein at least one of oxygen and H2 0 is
supplied to the cathode and H2 is supplied to the anode. The gases may be provided by
diffusion through a porous or diffusion electrode, and H2 may also be provided by permeation
                                               53

through a suitable hydrogen permeable electrode. The hydrogen permeable electrode may
comprise at least one of Mo, a Mo alloy such as MoNi, MoCu, MoCo, TZM, and H242, Ni,
Co, a Ni alloy such as NiCo, and other transition and inner transition metals and alloys such
as CuCo. The application of H2 is in an amount sufficient to retard anode corrosion while
maintaining electrical power gain. The permeation anode may be run at increasing current
densities with proportional increases in hydrogen permeation rate. The hydrogen permeation
rate may be controlled by at least one of increasing the hydrogen pressure to the membrane,
increasing the cell temperature, decreasing the membrane thickness, and changing the
membrane composition such as the wt%s of metals of an the alloy such as a Mo alloy. In an
embodiment, a hydrogen dissociator such as a noble metal such as Pt or Pd is coated on the
interior of the permeation anode such as a Mo or MoCu anode to increase the amount of
atomic H to increase the permeation rate. The hydrogen pressure may be maintained in the
range of at least one of about 1 Torr to 500 atm, 10 Torr to 100 atm, or 100 Torr to 5 atm.
The hydrogen permeation rate may be in the range of at least one of about 1 X 10-1 mole s-1
cm-2 to 1 X 10-4 mole    s-1 cm-2 , 1 X 10-12 mole s-1 cm-2 to 1 X 10-5 mole s-1 cm- 2 , 1 X 10-11 mole
s- cm2 to I X 10-6 mole s-1 cm-2, 1 X 10-l mole s-1 cm2 to 1 X 10-7 mole s-1 cm-2, or 1 X 10-9
mole s-1 cm-2 to 1 X 10-8 mole s-1 cm-2 . The hydrogen consumed by permeation may have a
corresponding theoretical power from forming H2 0 that is significantly less than the power of
the CIHT cell due to hydrino formation. Therefore, the hydrogen supply system such as the
manifolds, lines, and channels, and permeation anodes may be proportionally more compact
than those of a conventional hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell. In an embodiment, the anode traps a
gas boundary layer of H2 from a source such as at least one of in situ electrolysis, permeation,
and sparging. The matrix such as MgO may assist in trapping H2 gas at the anode. In an
embodiment, the anode active surface is face downward such that H2 is trapped when
diffusing vertically. In an embodiment, the hydrogen permeation pressure may be less than
atmospheric to prevent expansion or physical distortion of the anode.                    The hydrogen
permeable anode may comprise a highly permeable membrane coated with a material that is
effective at facilitating the hydrino reaction such as Mo or a Mo alloy such as MoNi, MoCu,
MoCo, Co, CoCu, CoNi. Exemplary H permeable materials are Ni(H2), V(H 2 ), Ti(H 2),
Nb(H 2), Pd(H 2), PdAg(H 2), Fe(H 2), Ta(H 2) and stainless steel (SS) such as 430 SS (H 2). The
electrolyte may comprise a molten salt such as one of those of the disclosure such as LiOH
LiBr. The permeation rate may be high such as one corresponding to being within a range of
about 1% to 50% of the discharge power. In an embodiment, the oxide surface layer of the H
permeable material such as beta-Ti and V is removed by means such as etching such as argon
gas ion etching and subsequent sputtered with of a thin layer of Pd (e.g. 2-3 microns).
        The cell may be maintained under intermittent electrolysis conditions with hydrogen
also supplied to the anode by diffusion, flow, or permeation. The rate of supply is controlled
to maintain excess electrical power generation by the CIHT cell while the hydrogen addition
                                                   54

protects the anode from corrosion. The anode material such as the composition of the Mo
alloy, permeable membrane thickness, cell temperature, and internal hydrogen pressure as
well other parameters that effect the hydrogen permeation rate may be selected to achieve the
desire hydrogen flow rate. The hydrogen flow rate that achieves the protection of the anode
from corrosion may be low compared to that required to maintain the electrical power
generated by the cell via a conventional hydrogen-oxygen to water fuel cell reaction.
Furthermore, in an embodiment, the hydrogen supply may receive hydrogen that permeates in
the reverse direction during the charging phase of the intermittent electrolysis.       Thus, the
anode gas supply system such as the manifold and gas anode may be made proportionately
more compact. The supply of hydrogen to the cathode may be from the electrolysis or H 20.
The charge-discharge frequency of intermittent electrolysis of the CIHT cell may be a higher
frequency with H2 gas applied to the anode. The frequency may be in the range of 0.1 Hz to
 10,000 Hz or another suitable range of the disclosure. In an embodiment, the H2 and 02
supplied to the cell provide at least some of the H2 0 inventory for the intermittent
electrolysis. The electrolyte may comprise a compound such as an oxide such as Li 2 0 or a
hydroscopic compound of the disclosure such as at least one of KMgCl 3, MgCl 2 , and CaCl 2
that reversibly binds H2 0 to maintain a desired electrolytic concentration. The gas pressure
may be any desired to maintain at least one of the desired power output from each cell, H2
permeation rate, H2 protection of the anode, oxygen reduction rate at the cathode. At least
one of the hydrogen and oxygen pressure may be in the range of at least one of about 0.01
atm to 1000 atm, 0.1 to 100 atm, and I to 10 atm.
        In an embodiment, H2 0 vapor supplied to the periphery of the cells may diffuse into
the electrolyte layer from the periphery and transport to the cathode. In an embodiment, H2 0
delivery to the cell such as the cathode may be achieved using a capillary system or radial gas
channels with circumferential perforations to deliver H2 0 into the center of the cell relative to
the periphery.      In an embodiment, the cathode comprises radial gas channels with
circumferential perforations and a surrounding external source of 02 gas such as a
surrounding atmosphere such as 02 gas or air. In an embodiment, H2 0 may be supplied to
the cathode by at least one of absorption by the electrolyte from periphery and through a
standard MCFC-type gas cathode. The demands for H2 0 supply may be low based on H2 0
conservation during operation with some consumption providing up to 50 MJ/mole H2 0. In
an embodiment, the consumed water produces hydrinos and 02.                     Based on H2 0
decomposition and recombination reactions over the cell cycle with any net consumption
producing up to 50 MJ/mole H2 0, the size of the H2 0 distribution system such as one of the
disclosure such as a gas supply system such as a standard MCFC gas cathode may be
relatively small compared to the gas cathode of a standard fuel cell such as one of a proton
exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) or molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC). The 02
pressure may be somewhat static since it is generated in situ. An initial inventory of 02 may
                                               55

be relatively constant over time in the case that the source of ions of the ion current during
discharge is predominantly from H2 0. In an embodiment, the mass balance predominantly
comprises conversion of H 2 0 to hydrinos and 02, such that excess 02 is removed and may be
in connection with the 02 inventory or an 02 reservoir. Predominantly, H2 0 may be supplied
to the cell and may constitute the majority of the mass flow into the cell with product oxygen
and hydrinos flowing out. H 2 0 may become part of the electrolyte by hydration and the
electrolyte may serve as a reservoir of H2 0 by dehydration of hydrate H2 0 and also reaction
such as 2LiOH to Li2 0 + H 20. Furthermore, the H 2 inventory of the permeable membrane
may be regenerative based on in situ electrolysis of H2 0.       In addition to electrolysis by
applied power during the charge phase of the intermittent cycle, the H2 0 may serve as a
source of H with the energy of H 2 0 decomposition provided by the hydrino reaction.
Exemplary reactions that ultimately form hydrino and oxygen from H2 0 are those of the
disclosure. In an embodiment, the H inventory may be at least one of partially, substantially,
and totally maintained by the decomposition of H2 0 by the hydrino reaction requiring less to
no application of electrolysis charging. Thus, the H 2 inventory of a H 2 permeable electrode
may be relatively constant over time. In an embodiment, the same applies in the case of a
hydrided anode of the disclosure. At least one of the H2 and 02 pressure may be controlled
by controlling the electrolysis wherein the pressure of at least one of H2 and 02 may be
monitored by an electrode such as one based on the Nernst equation for the corresponding
gas.   The voltage may be relative to a suitable reference electrode to record each gas
independently.
        In an embodiment, the perimeter of the anode is sealed to at least one of oxygen and
H2 0 diffusing from an ambient source. In an embodiment, the cathode is porous such that it
supports transport such as gaseous transport of at least one of oxygen and H 2 0.         In an
embodiment, the cathode comprises at least one layer.         Such a compound cathode may
comprise a layer that supports the transport of at least one of oxygen and H 20. The transport
may comprise gaseous diffusion. The diffusion may be from a circumferential source such as
an ambient atmosphere of at least one of oxygen and H20.              The composition of the
atmosphere and pressure may be any desired such as those of the disclosure.               In an
embodiment, the H2 0 pressure of the cell is maintained at an elevated pressure such as one
greater than atmospheric pressure. The H2 0 may be supplied to the cell using a pump against
the internal pressure. Alternatively, an internal H2 0 reservoir may be filled with the cell at
low temperature; where after, the cell temperature and reservoir temperature are raised to
create the elevated H2 0 pressure. The CIHT cell housing may be pressure tight and may be
capable of supporting pressures greater than ambient.
        A repeating unit of a CIHT cell stack comprising a permeation anode 5 and a gas feed
6 is shown in FIGURE 3A. At least one of H2 0 and 02 is input to the cathode that may
comprise a porous or compound cathode. The compound cathode may comprise multiple
                                               56

layers such as a porous layer 2 for gas transport and a catalytic layer 3 such as NiO to reduce
oxygen. In an embodiment, the cathode such as a compound cathode is porous to facilitate
the transport of at least one of H2 0 and 02. The cathode may further comprise a current
collector 2 wherein juxtaposed cathodes are separated by an electrical insulator 1. The cell
further comprises an electrolyte layer 4 that optionally comprises a separator such as a matrix
such as MgO. In another embodiment, the permeation anode 5 and gas feed 6 are replaced by
an anode 7 that may be hydrided and support electrochemical reactions from opposing sides
for corresponding opposing cells as shown in FIGURE 3B.
         In an embodiment, the compound cathode comprises a transport layer such as a
gaseous diffusion layer and a catalytic layer to reduce at least one of 02 and H2 0.         The
catalytic layer is in contact with the electrolyte and may further comprises a different material
than the transport layer such as Pt doped NiO and other cathode materials of the disclosure.
The transport layer may be more porous than the catalytic layer to support transport. The
catalytic layer may have smaller pore sizes or less pores to prevent the electrolyte from
excessively wicking into the cathode and flooding it. Due to the greater porosity of the
transport layer relative to the catalytic layer, a pressure gradient exists from the transport to
the catalytic layer. The pressure may contribute to the prevention of electrolyte flooding of
the cathode. The external pressure of the atmosphere of the diffusing gas and the relative
porosity of the different layers of the compound cathode may be adjusted to achieve a desired
pressure gradient between the layers. The cathode layer may comprise support elements such
as Ni, NiO, or MgO beads that prevent the electrode from excessive compression by
mechanical pressures in the stack. In another embodiment, the electrolyte comprises a matrix
that prevents the electrolyte from excessively wicking into the cathode. The pore size of the
matrix may be adjusted to achieve the desired capillary forces to prevent the wicking into the
cathode.
         In an embodiment, the CIHT cell H2 and 02 inventory may be relatively static and
each gas may be produced by external or internal electrolysis. H 2 and 02 may be re-supplied
by internal electrolysis with an initial inventory and supplemental gases supplied from an
external source. In an embodiment, an oxygen inventory may be provided by an oxygen
compound that can reversibly form and decompose to maintain the desired 02 pressure at the
cathode. Suitable exemplary compounds that are a source of oxygen are oxides, peroxides,
superoxides, and oxyhydroxides of the disclosure. H2 0 may be provided as a gas or by
dehydration of a compound with bound H2 0 such as a hydrate. The hydrate is selected to
achieve the desired H2 0 pressure at the selected maintained temperature of the compound
such as the cell temperature or gas supply system temperature.          Since the anode H2 and
cathode 02 and H2 0 flow demands may be relative low compared to those of a conventional
fuel cell, the gas supply systems such as one of a gas cathode and one comprising a hydrogen
supply manifold and channel to the hydrogen permeable membrane anode or H2 sparging
                                                 57

anode may be relatively small. In an embodiment, the hydrogen permeable anode becomes
saturated with hydrogen such that the hydrogen pressure of the hydrogen supply remains
constant or may be increase. The external source of hydrogen may be the decomposition of
H2 0 with the energy provided by the hydrino reaction. Representative reactions are those of
the disclosure.    The hydride may be maintained by adjusting the intermittent electrolysis
waveform and conditions such as the electrolysis waveform such as the charge voltage,
charge duration, and current as well as those of the discharge cycle. The hydride state may
be monitored by the electrode voltage that may be relative to a reference voltage. The
voltage may be determined by the Nernst equation. In another embodiment, the anode such
as a hydrogen permeable anode may be preconditioned to be in the hydrogen-saturated state
such that an external hydrogen supply is not necessary. In this case, the cell stack may
comprise a bipolar plate design such as one of the disclosure wherein the anode of a bipolar
plate comprising an anode and cathode is pretreated to be hydrided. The pretreatment may be
by hydrogen permeation. The pretreatment may be by CIHT cell operation with hydrogen
permeation until the hydrogen flow is static. In an embodiment, the anode is pre-hydrided by
in situ electrolysis of H2 0 or by external electrolysis of H 20. The later may be performed in
an aqueous alkaline electrolysis cell wherein the cathode is the CIHT anode. The counter
electrode for the hydriding by external electrolysis may be Ni.        The anode may also be
hydrided by applying H2 gas.
         In an embodiment, the permeation anode may comprise a hydrogen-permeable
membrane attached to a membrane of low hydrogen permeability.              The lower permeable
layer may serve as a current collector of a bipolar plate such that the permeable membrane
faces the electrolyte and the lower permeable membrane contacts with the cathode of a
contiguous cell of the stack to comprise a bipolar electrode.
         In an embodiment, the back to back permeation anode of the disclosure may be
replaced by a hydrided anode such as a hydrided tapecast Ni, NiCo such as Ni(about 95
at%)Co(about 5 at%), Ni(about 94 at%)Co(about 5 at0 o)Cu(about 1 at%) and Ni, Mo, or Mo
alloy anode. The two faces of the hydrided anode may serve as anodes for back-to-back cells
with corresponding cathodes. Hydrogen may be generated on both surfaces of the back-to
back anode by the back-to-back cells to maintain the hydride state of the anode. Thus, such
an embodiment comprising a single hydrided anode may replace the permeable membrane
anode having anode layers separated by an internal hydrogen reservoir wherein the external
supply of hydrogen on the inside of later is replaced with hydrogen generated by electrolysis
on the opposite surfaces of the former.
         In an embodiment, the hydrogen permeation electrode such as the anode may
comprise a composite of at least two layers of different materials such as materials having a
different composition or different structure.        Exemplary composite anodes comprise a
hydrogen permeable layer such as a hydrogen permeable membrane such as a metal foil that
                                                 58

serves as a substrate to support at least one other layer bound to it. The other layer may have
high surface area such as a sputtered, metal sprayed, vapor deposited, tape cast and annealed
layer. Other methods known in the Art such as those of the disclosure may be used to apply
the other layer such as a metal or alloy layer such as a Mo or Mo alloy layer that may have
high surface area. The outer layer may have a high catalysis rate to form hydrinos such as
one comprising at least one of Ni, Co, Cu, NiCo, NiCoCu, Mo, and a Mo alloy such as those
of the disclosure.
        In another embodiment, the anode comprises a porous material such as a sintered or
tape cast metal anode such as one comprising Ni, Mo, NiCo, a Mo alloy, and others of the
disclosure wherein protection from corrosion is provided by sparing H2. The hydrogen flow
may be controlled such that excess electrical power gain is achieved. The hydrogen flow rate
per geometric area of the H 2 bubbling or sparging electrode may be in the range of about 1 X
 10-13 mole s-1  cm-2 to 1 X 10-4 mole s-1 cm-2, 1 X 10-42 mole s-1 cm-2 to 1 X 10-5 mole s-1 cm-2
 1 X 10-" mole s-1 cm-2 to 1 X 10-6 mole s-1 cm-2, 1 X 10-1 mole s-1 cm-2 to I X 10-7 mole s
cm-2, or 1 X 10-9 mole s-1 cm-2 to 1 X 10-8 mole s-1 cm-2.          The hydrogen may be evenly
supplied to the porous electrode by permeation through an underlying hydrogen permeable
membrane.       In another embodiment, the porous electrode may be cast onto of hydrogen
diffuser such as a fine mesh screen coated with the porous electrode and sealed at the edges
wherein hydrogen is supplied from a chamber underneath the mesh.
        The application of H2 0 as at least one of a gas, vapor, or liquid allows for rapid
supply to the cathode surface without the necessity of H2 0 being absorbed at the electrolyte
edge with supply to the cathode provided by at least one of diffusion and migration in the
electrolyte layer. In an embodiment, the mole% of the 02 supplied to the cathode may be
greater than that of air and may be in the range of 0.01% to 100%. The cathode oxygen
reduction rate may be increased by using gas with a higher concentration of 02 compared to
air such that the cathode gas supply system such as the manifolds, lines, channels, and gas
cathodes may be proportionately more compact. The supply of oxygen may be provided by
the electrolysis of H 2 0 wherein the electrolysis power may be provided by the CIHT cell. In
this case, the system may comprise a hydrogen-oxygen separator.             The cathode half-cell
system may be made more compact such as a factor of five times as a result of the supply of
up to pure 02 to the cathode rather than air having 20% 02. A further reduction in scale may
be possible due to the lack of the otherwise necessity to remove N 2 of air as it is depleted of
oxygen with an 02 partial pressure drop. The cathode may comprise those of the disclosure
such as NiO that may comprise oxidized Ni celment or Ni tape cast. The cathode may
comprise a dopant such as at least one of Pt, Pd, Ir, Ru, Rh, Re, and other dimensionally
stable anode materials (DSAMs) such as those used in chlor-alkali electrolysis. The DSAMs
may be stable to forming a metal halide under CIHT cell operating conditions. The dopant
may on the surface of the cathode and be in any desired at% such as in the range of 0.001 to
                                                 59

20 at%. The hydrogen permeation electrode may comprise at least one of Mo and a Mo alloy
such as at least one of MoNi, MoCu, MoB, MoC, MoSi, MoCuB, MoNiB, MoSiB and others
of the disclosure. In an embodiment, a hydrogen permeable membrane such a Ni is coated
with a high surface area material such as tape cast Mo, Mo alloy, Ni celmet, Co, CoCu
tapecast on Ni celmet, CoCu tape cast, Ni tape cast, or Ni-Co tape cast such as 95/5wt%. In
an embodiment, the coating is achieved by cladding the tape cast material onto the H
permeable membrane.       The tape cast cladding onto the membrane may be achieved by
compression of the components.        In an embodiment, the support for tape casting anode
materials such as Co is Co clement or carbon mesh.
        In an embodiment, the electrolyte comprises a mixture of LiOH and LiBr, a mixture
of LiOH and NaOH, or a mixture of LiOH, LiBr, and NaOH, and optionally a matrix such as
MgO, and further comprises another salt that increases the oxygen reduction rate such as at
least one of MOH and M'OH (M and M' may be chosen from the group of Na, K, Rb, and
Cs). In an embodiment, an alkali cation that provides a higher oxygen reduction rate than an
electrolyte comprising Li such as LiOH-LiBr is supplied as at least one of a salt such as MX
(M may be chosen from the group of Na, K, Rb, and Cs; X = halide such as Br) and a matrix
material such as at least one of KAlO 2, NaAlO 2, NaxNiO 2 and KxNiO 2 . In an embodiment, at
least one of MOH and M'OH comprises a layer near the positive electrode.            The higher
mobility of Li+ may cause it to have a greater concentration near the negative electrode. In an
embodiment, the at% of MOH and M'OH is adjusted to maximize the oxygen reduction rate
while favoring reaction pathway to forming hydroxide ion versus other oxygen ions such as
peroxide and superoxide.      In an embodiment, at least one of oxygen ions peroxide, H
peroxide ion, superoxide, and oxide ion are formed at the cathode side. The H2 0 of the
electrolyte comprising LiOH may react with one or more of the oxygen ions such as peroxide
or superoxide to form a least one of oxygen and OH-. In an embodiment, the H2 0 pressure is
controlled to achieve this reaction. In an embodiment, the system comprises a pressure vessel
to maintain pressures higher than atmospheric. The pressure may be high to maintain at least
one of liquid H 20, high pressure H 2 0 vapor, steam, and super-saturated steam. The pressure
may be any desired such as in the range of at least one of about 1 atm to 500 amt, about 2 atm
and 100 atm, and about 2 atm and 10 atm.          In an embodiment, the cathode comprises a
system such as a gas manifold and channels such as those of a bipolar plate shown in
FIGURE 2 to apply gas such as air, Ar-0 2, or 02 to the cathode active surface. The gas
pressure may be above atmospheric. The pressurized gas may blow out wicked electrolyte
and increase the 02 reduction rate by increasing the mass flow.
        In an embodiment of a CIHT cell system, the anode comprises a hydrogen permeable
membrane on two sides facing back to back to corresponding anode half-cells. The hydrogen
permeation electrode may comprise at least one of Mo and a Mo alloy such as at least one of
MoNi, MoCu, MoCo, MoB, MoC, MoSi, MoCuB, MoNiB, MoSiB, and others of the
                                               60

disclosure such as Co, CoCu, Ni, and NiCo. Each cell further comprises a cathode half-cell
and a cathode. The cathode may comprise NiO or another of the disclosure. The cathode and
anode half-cells may comprise a single electrolyte layer such as a mixed molten hydroxide
halide salt such as LiOH-LiBr and optionally a matrix such as MgO. The corresponding
cathodes and anodes of at least two such cells are wired in series or in parallel as desired. In
an embodiment, the cells of a stack of cells may each comprise such a two-sided anode.
Alternatively, at least one cell may a bipolar plate. The system further comprises a gas
supply to at least one of the cathode and anode of at least one cell. The system further
comprises a hydrogen gas supply that may have a common feed to each double-sided anode.
In an embodiment, the cathode is two-sided and back-to-back with each facing its
corresponding cathode half-cell. In an embodiment, the back-to-back cathode may comprise
an insulator that electrically separates the two sides.       In an exemplary embodiment, an
alkaline earth metal oxide such as MgO may serve as the electrical spacer between cathode
plates. Each cathode may have a gas supply comprising at least one of a source of oxygen and
H 20. Each double-sided cathode may have a common gas supply. The supply may be such
that each double sided cathodes remain electrically insulated from each other. The insulator
may comprise beads such as MgO beads that allow 02 to diffuse between the electrically
separated layers. In an embodiment, contaminant gases in the supply may be removed with a
getter. In an exemplary embodiment, at least one of oxygen and H2 0 are removed from the
hydrogen gas supplied to the anode by a getter that reacts with the contaminant to form a
nonvolatile compound. The getter may be a metal, metalloid, or other oxidizable material
such as an alkali, alkaline earth, transition, inner transition, and earth metal, and Al, Ga, In,
Sn, Pb, S, Te, Se, N, P, As, Sb, Bi, C, Si, Ge, and B, and other elements that form oxides or
oxyanions. Each back-to back electrode may have an inlet and exit gas line. At least one of
the inlet and exit gas lines may have a getter in line to remove contaminants. The gases may
be recirculated from and to the electrode with flow through or over a getter to remove
contaminants.
        Due to a large difference in aqueous solubility of KOH versus LiOH, in an
embodiment, the CIHT cell comprises two layers: one comprising predominantly KOH at the
cathode and another comprising predominantly precipitated LiOH at the anode.                   The
electrolyte may further comprise a halide such as LiBr such that a mixture with LiOH having
a lower melting point is formed. The cell may be pressurized such that the melting point of
the LiOH or LiOH mixture such as LiOH-LiBr is reached. An exemplary electrolyte is a
eutectic mixture of LiOH-LiBr that melts at about 300 'C.          The KOH has a high oxygen
reduction rate, and the LiOH or LiOH-LiBr electrolyte is suitably non-corrosive such that the
anode such as Ni, Mo, or Ni or Mo alloys are stable, especially with the application of
hydrogen at the anode by means such as permeation or sparging. Thus, the two-layer cell is
suitable for a high current with longevity. In order to maintain H 2 0 in the electrolyte, the cell
                                                 61

may be pressurized in a sealed vessel. In an exemplary embodiment, the cell temperature is
300'C and the pressure is about 85 atm. A suitable KOH-H 20 mole ratio is in the range of
about 50-50% to        9 9 -1% such as exemplary 80-20 mole %. In an embodiment, the electrolyte
further comprises a matrix such as those of the disclosure such as MgO. In an embodiment,
an electrolyte comprising KOH further comprises MgO. The KOH-MgO ratio may be in the
range of about 100 to 0.01, or in the range of about 2 to 0.2.               In an embodiment, the
electrolyte comprises two layers, an anode layer of LiOH or LiOH-LiBr with an
immobilizing matrix such as LiAlO 2 or A10          2 and a cathode layer comprising KOH. The
cathode of the KOH cell may comprise four-electron reduction catalysts such as those of the
present disclosure. The anode may comprise an alloy such as a Mo alloy such as MoNi alloy.
The cathode may comprise a catalyst to deactivate peroxide ion such as Pt.                The layer
comprising KOH may comprise a hydroscopic compound to increase the water concentration
to convert peroxide ion to hydroxide.          Suitable hydroscopic compounds are those of the
disclosure such as MgBr 2.
          In an embodiment, the cathode comprises a compound or material to decompose
oxygen radicals to less reactive species such as OH-. The cathode may comprise a compound
or material to absorb oxygen. The compound or material may comprise carbon or a Pt or Pd
on a support such as carbon. H 2 0 may be supplied to the cathode by sparging. H2 0 may
react with active oxygen species such as 02, oxygen radicals, or oxygen ions to at least one
form less reactive species such as OH-. 02 may be sparged through the cathode. Both H2 0
and oxygen may be sparged through the cathode.
          In an embodiment, H 2 0 is applied as at least one of a gas, vapor, or liquid to the
hydrogen sparging anode. The H 2 0 may react with oxygen or oxygen radicals or ions to
form OH- and may be protective to the anode, preventing corrosion.
          In an embodiment, the aqueous electrolytic CIHT cell such as one comprising a KOH
electrolyte may be maintained with a voltage sufficient to prevent the anode form corroding
as give in the disclosure. Exemplary aqueous CIHT cell are [R-Ni, MoB, MoC, MoSi, MoNi,
MoCo, or MoCu/KOH or K 2 CO 3 / Ni, NiO, NiAg, Ag, steam carbon (SC), MnO2, MnO 2 /C,
Mn 2 0 3 /C, or MnOOH].         In an embodiment, the anode may comprise an oxide such as an
oxide of Mo such as at least one of MoO 2 and MoO 3.
          In an embodiment of an alkaline aqueous electrolytic cell, at least one of the pH of the
electrolyte and the cell voltage are controlled to achieved stability of the anode. Suitable
alkaline electrolytes are KOH, K 2 CO 3 , K 2HPO 4, K 3 PO 4 , and K 2 SO 4 wherein another alkali or
alkaline earth metal may replace K. In an embodiment, the pH may be maintained by an
electrolyte comprising a buffer. Suitable exemplary buffers and the pH range are sodium
carbonate/ sodium hydrogen carbonate (9.2 - 10.8), sodium tetraborate (Na2 B 4 0 7 -10H 2 0 or
Na 2 [B 4 0 5 (OH) 4 ]-8H 2 0)/ sodium hydroxide (9.3 - 10.7), sodium bicarbonate / sodium
hydroxide (9.60 - 11.0), sodium hydrogen orthophosphate / sodium hydroxide (11.0 - 11.9),
                                                   62

potassium chloride/ sodium hydroxide (12.0 - 13.0).         The stable voltage and pH may be
determined using a Pourbaix diagram. In an embodiment, the pH may be basic and may be in
the range of at least one of about 7.1 to 14, 7.1 to 13, 7.1 to 12, 7.1 to 11, 7.1 to 10, 7.1 to 9
and 7.1 to 8. The molarity may be any desire such as that which establishes the desired
property such as pH or electrical conductivity. The molarity may be in the range of at least
one of about 0.001 M to 30 M, 0.01 M to 20 M, and 0.1 M to 20 M. Suitable metals that are
stable in alkaline electrolyte at negative potential are Ag, As, Au, Bi, Cd, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mo, Ni,
Os, Pb, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Sb, Sn, Tc, and Te and Co and alloys such as CoCu or CoNi. A
corrosion product additive may be added to protect the anode. The additive may produce a
common ion effect of the corrosion product. For example, at least one of a cobalt or copper
compound such as a halide such as CuBr 2, or CoBr 2 may be added to a cell comprising a
CoCu anode. The voltage and concentration for an additive to stabilize the solid phase anode
metal or metal oxides as a passivated electrode may be determined from a Pourbaix potential
pH diagram. As an example, Mo or Co materials may be operated in the 0.9 to 1 V region at
less than 0.1 V over potential in a suitable pH range such as less than about pH 11. The over
potential increases with current; so, in an embodiment, high surface area materials are better
due to lower current density and over potential.
        In order to exploit the high oxygen reduction rate of an electrolyte comprising KOH
and the lower corrosion of an electrolyte comprising LiOH, in an embodiment, the CIHT cell
comprises a two-layer electrolyte with KOH at the cathode and LiOH, and optionally another
salt such as LiBr, at the anode. The electrolyte layers may have different physical states. The
cell may be operated at a lower limiting temperature wherein the top KOH layer is liquid and
the bottom LiOH layer such as LiOH-LiBr is a solid or semisolid. In an embodiment, KOH
may be wicked into the cathode, and the cell further comprises a LiOH-LiBr electrolyte at the
anode. In an embodiment, the cell comprises a matrix and cathode with differential pore
sizes that selectively creates the two layers by differences in capillary forces between the
electrolytes that selects for the separation between the matrix and the cathode. In another
embodiment, separate KOH and LiOH-LiBr flow streams are fed to the cell with KOH at
cathode and LiOH-LiBr at anode. The electrolyte may further comprise a matrix such as
MgO.
        In an embodiment, the electrolyte may comprise an aqueous alkaline electrolyte such
as KOH. The electrolyte may comprise more than one hydroxide such as LiOH and KOH
and may further comprise another salt such as LiBr. At least two different hydroxides may
be separated by a separator such as an OH- exchange membrane such as fumapem (fumatech
Germany).     One hydroxide such LiOH may be less corrosion.          It may be localized to an
anode compartment defined by the membrane. Another such as KOH may permit a high
oxygen reduction rate. It may be localized at the corresponding cathode compartment. The
cathode may comprise carbon such as at least one of steam carbon, or one of more of NiO,
                                                63

and Ag impregnated NiO. The anode may comprise at least one of Mo, Mo, alloy, Ni,
transition metal, transition metal alloy such as CoCu, CoCu + another metal such as Mo. The
anode may comprise a tape cast anode. The cathode may be supplied with 02 or a source of
02  such as air. The cathode may have a portion that is un-submerged in the electrolyte.
         In an embodiment, the electrolyte may comprise a solid fuel such as Cu(OH) 2 +
CuBr 2 that may comprise eutectic salt electrolyte. Since Cu(OH) 2 dehydrates to H2 0 + CuO
at a temperature less than the melting point, an alkali hydroxide may be added. For example,
KOH or LiOH is added to CuO or Cu(OH) 2 + CuBr 2 wherein KOH + CuO goes to K2 CuO 2
for example.
         In an embodiment, the temperature of the CIHT cell comprising a molten salt
electrolyte such as LiOH-LiBr, and optionally a matrix such as MgO is maintained at an
elevated temperature by resistive heating. In an embodiment, the cell comprises a resistive
heater. In an embodiment, the resistive heater comprises at least one heating element that is
located axially central to the edge of the stack. In an embodiment, the heating element is
substantially in the center of each electrode of the stack and penetrates the electrodes. The
heating element may be nonconductive to prevent cells of the stack from shorting. The
heating element may comprise a nonconductive coating such as a ceramic coating such as
MgO.      The power for the resistive heater may be supplied by the CIHT cell.                In an
embodiment, the temperature at the edge of each cell is maintained at a lower temperature
than that at the center such that the electrolyte solidifies at the edge to provide a so-called wet
seal. In an embodiment, the electrolyte may comprise a different composition at the edge of
each cell from that inward from the edge. The edge electrolyte may have at least one of a
higher melting point and a higher viscosity then that in the center such that a wet seal forms
at the edge.     The edge electrolyte may comprise a different molar ratio of at least one
component of the electrolyte such as a salt and a matrix and may also comprise different or
additional salts, matrices, as well as additives. The matrix that may differ at the edge may
comprise an alkaline earth oxide.
         In another embodiment, the electrolyte layer thickness is such that the electrolyte is
maintained in place by capillary forces with at least one of the electrodes and an optionally
added matrix such as MgO. The separation of the electrodes may be maintained by an inert
spacer material such as MgO such as MgO beads of the size corresponding to the desired
electrode separation. The electrode separation may be in the range of at least about 1 P m to
 1 cm, about 5 p m to 5 mm, and about 10 p m to 1 mm. In an embodiment, the matrix may
comprise stratified layers of different matrix particle sizes. The stratification may permit
cathode material such as NiO to be confined to the cathode region while avoiding active area
blockage of the anode wherein the matrix is denser or less porous and less dense or more
porous in the different regions such as at the cathode and anode regions, respectively. In
                                                 64

another embodiment, the matrix is soluble in the electrolyte and the stratification may
comprise different densities or viscosities.
        A schematic drawing of a CIHT cell stack 200 with a central heater 201 is shown in
FIGURE 4. The heater 201 having power leads 202 and 203 is central to the cells of the
stack, each comprising a cathode 205, an anode 206, and an electrolyte 207 wherein the
cathode and anode may comprise a bipolar plate as shown and may further comprise a
conductive separator or bimetallic junction between the cathode and anode. The CIHT cell
stack may further comprise two terminals such as the one shown (210), a casing 211,
insulation layers such as 212-216, and an electrically insulating end cap 230.
        The electrolyte may comprise a pellet. Alternatively, the electrolyte may be contained
in a suitable structural element such as a nonconductive O-ring such as a MgO ring. In an
embodiment, the MgO structural element is fashioned to a desired form such as that of an 0
ring using Mg metal to form the ring and oxidizing it to MgO.           The electrodes may be
compressed on the top and bottom to sandwich the element. The electrolyte may be confined
in the so formed the inter-electrode cavity. In an embodiment, Mg is replaced with another
metal capable of being oxidized such as Al or a rare earth metal. In an embodiment, the
corresponding oxide is insoluble or has a low solubility in the electrolyte. In an alternative to
the structural element, the electrolyte is held in place by a wet seal of electrolyte comprising
un-melted electrolyte at the cell edges wherein an embodiment, the stack is heated from the
center. The electrodes may be machined to make a small gap at the edge to facilitate the wet
seal. At least one of the pore size of at least one of the electrolyte and the matrix may be
adjusted and the ratio of the matrix may be adjusted to provide the desired wetting of the
electrodes by controlling the capillary action. In an embodiment of the bipolar plate, the
anode and cathode are separated by a separator that prevents electrolyte from causing an
electrical short circuit between the two corresponding cells wherein the electrolyte may be
wicked into at least one electrode.      The separator may comprise a conductor such as a
metallic or graphite sheet. The separator may also serve as a bimetallic junction.
        In an embodiment, the metals of the electrodes of opposite sides of the bipolar plate
are different such as Ni on one side and NiO on the other, wherein NiO may be on both sides
with one side having a greater weight percentage. Alternatively, one side may be one metal
and the other side another metal such as Ni versus 242 alloy or Mo. The different metals may
alternate throughout the stack. In another embodiment, the dipolar plate may comprise an
electrically conductive separator between the anode and cathode.            The separator may
comprise a different material such as a different metal than that of at least one of the cathode
and anode. The separator and at least one electrode may comprise a bimetallic electrode.
The bimetallic may comprise a bimetallic junction. The bimetallic may comprise at least one
conductor such as a metal or alloy electroplated on at least one other conductor such as a
second metal or alloy. At least one of the bimetallic electrode or junction may result in an
                                                65

intrinsic voltage that causes the hydrino reaction rate to increase. In an embodiment, the
bimetallic comprises two conductors such as a metal such as Ni and an oxide such as the
oxide of the metal that may further comprise a compound such as an alkali metal oxide. A
suitable exemplary alkali metal oxide is lithiated nickel oxide. The increase may be due to a
better energy match of the catalyst and H to permit a hydrino transition.            In another
embodiment, the electrolytes on opposite sides of the bipolar plate are different.         The
electrolyte difference may comprise at least one of a different composition having at least one
different constituent and the concentrations of the same constituents of the electrolyte may be
different. For example, the electrolyte may comprise a matrix such as MgO on one side and
LiAlO 2 on the other. Alternatively, the electrolyte may comprise LiOH-LiBr on one side and
LiOH-LiCl on the other. Additionally, one side may comprise some weight percentage of
NaOH. In an embodiment, the difference between one side of the electrode and the other
causes the chemical potential, Fermi level, or voltage of the electrode for each half-cell to
differ from that of the respective electrolyte. In another embodiment, a separating medium or
spacer such as a non-conducting material or insulator separates the opposite sides of the
bipolar plate such that the chemical potential, Fermi level, or voltage of the side of the
electrode contacting the electrolyte is different from that contacting the separating medium.
In an embodiment, the difference in chemical potential, Fermi level, or voltage facilitates the
catalysis of hydrogen to form hydrinos. In an embodiment, at least one of different electrode
metals, bimetallic junctions, electrolytes, matrices, and conditions such as hydration and
temperature are alternated throughout the stack. In an embodiment, the cathode is a different
material such as a different metal than that of the anode.       The different material of the
cathode relative to that of the anode may replace the requirement for a bimetallic anode of the
bipolar plate. In an embodiment, the bimetallic nature of the bipolar plate to distinguish the
anode and cathode is satisfied by using a single layer anode with a different cathode material
such as a different metal.       Suitable exemplary cathodes comprise one of those of the
disclosure.
         In another embodiment, at least one electrode comprises multiple layers comprising at
least two different materials. The electrodes may comprise laminates of different materials.
Inner layers may change the electrode potential of the outer layers in contact with the
electrolyte or having an increased contact with the electrolyte.     The outer layers may be
selected to be resistant to corrosion. Suitable stable materials for outer layers are Ni, noble
metals, and corrosion resistant alloys such as those of the disclosure. Suitable materials for
the inner layer or layers to change the electrode potential are Mo and H242 as well as a
transition metal such as V, Cr, Ti, Mn, Co, Cu, or Zn, an inner transition metal such as Zr,
Ag, Cd, Hf, Ta, W, a rare earth metal such as La, or alloy such as LaNi5 , or other metal or
metalloid or alloy such as Al, Sn, In, ad Pb, and other alloys such as MoCo, MoCu, MoMn,
MoNi, and MoCr. The electrode may serve as the anode or cathode. Exemplary multi-layer,
                                                66

multi-metallic electrodes, or laminated electrodes that may serve as the anode are Ni/Mo/Ni
pressed, Ni/H242/Ni pressed, and Ni/H242/Mo/Ni pressed. In an embodiment, the electrode
may be a molten salt such as a mixture of hydroxide and halide salts such as alkali ones such
as those of the disclosure such as LiOH-LiBr or an aqueous electrolyte such as a hydroxide or
carbonate electrolyte or others of the disclosure.
        In an embodiment of a laminated electrode, the metal or metals comprise at least one
of a group having low water reactivity such as Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb, Bi, Co, Cd, Ge, Au, Ir, Fe, Hg,
Mo, Os, Pd, Re, Rh, Ru, Se, Ag, Tc, Te, Tl, Sn, W, and Zn. In an embodiment, the
theoretical free energy of the reaction of the metal with H2 0 is about zero within the range of
-500 to + 500 kJ/mole or preferably within the range of -100 to + 100 kJ/mole.

alkaline fuel cells known to those skilled in the art. Exemplary suitable structures, materials,
and methods follow. The separator or current collector may be Ni or Cu coated stainless steel
such as 310S/316L. The current collector may be perforated. The coating and be about 50
micron, but other thickness are suitable such a 1 micron to 1 mm. Other exemplary suitable
materials are iron-base alloys such as 304L, 309S, 310S, 314, 316L, 347, 405, 430, 446, 17

as GE-2541, FeCrAl + Hf, Haynes 214, FeCr alloy, IJR (406), 85H, Kanthal AF, and Ni3Al.
A suitable coating method is cladding, but other methods may be used such as electrolytic Ni
plating such as from a sulfamate bath, or electroless Ni plating. At least one electrode may
comprise one or more of these materials such as specially steels and alloys such as corrosion
resistant alloys.   The anode may be a hydrogen storage material such as those of the

           In an embodiment, the anode half-cell reaction is
           OH- + 2H to H2 0 + e- + H(1/p)                                                                        (54)
wherein the reaction of a first H with OH- to form H 2 0 catalyst and e- is concerted with the
H2 0 catalysis of a second H to hydrino. H that reacts with O- may be from M-H wherein M
is the anode material such as a metal. In an embodiment, the catalyst accepts 3X27.2 eV
matching the potential energy of the formed H2 0 molecule as given by Eq. (43) and
corresponding to m= 3 in Eq. (5) resulting in the formation of H(1/4). The continuous energy
released as the electron of the second H transitions to the hydrino state as well as the energy
                                                          68

released from the catalyst following acceptance from the second H may cause charging of the
anode. The charging may comprise capacitive charging of the ions of the electrolyte or
oxidation of at least one species of the electrolyte or electrodes. Thus, the energy released in
the electrochemical reaction to form H2 0 catalyst and the concerted H catalysis reaction to
form hydrinos powers the flow of current through the external circuit. The voltage may be
that of the hydrogen and oxygen cell reaction since the electrolyte comprises H 2 0 and species
comprising oxidation and reduction products of hydrogen, oxygen, and water.             The cell
reactions may comprise at least one of those given by Eqs. (90-93). The ion path through the
electrolyte to complete the circuit may comprise ions of the electrolyte such as at least one of
Li+, Off, oxide and peroxide ions, and Br- in the case of an electrolyte comprising LiOH
LiBr, or ions of the matrix. Thus, in an embodiment, the matrix serves as an ion conduction
medium wherein the conduction may be provided by charge transfer or ion transport.            In
another embodiment, the matrix comprises at least one of a mixture of oxide or oxides,
hydroxide or hydroxides, mixed metal oxidation states, electrolyte ions, and other ions. The
ion conduction may be by ion hopping. The transport may involve charge transfer or ion
transport of a species such as a negative ion such as one comprising at least one or oxygen
and hydrogen. Suitable species are at least one of oxygen species chosen from 02, 03, 0,
 O3, O, O, H 20, H3 0,    OH, OH+, OH-, HOOH, OOH-, 0-, 02-, O2, and O-           and H species
and hydrogen species chosen from H2, H, H+, H20, H3 0, OH, OH+, Off, HOOH, and OOH-.
In an exemplary embodiment, the transported species is a more a reduced state species
comprising oxygen such as 02- formed at the cathode formed from exemplary species 02, 03,
 03,    3    , O, H20, H30+, OH, OH+, OH,              H, OOH, 0, O2, and O . The more
reduced species may be oxidized at the anode.
         In an embodiment not having a matrix, the ion conduction may be through the
electrolyte during cell discharge. The transported species may be provided, at least partially,
external to the cell. The cell may be open such as open to atmosphere. In an exemplary
embodiment, at least one of external oxygen and H2 0 is reduced at the cathode, and a
reduced species such as the reduction product of at least one of external oxygen and H2 0 is
oxidized at the anode. The transport may be driven by the energy due to the catalysis of H to
hydrino states. The current due to the external oxidant such as at least one of external oxygen
and H2 0 is controlled to control corrosion such as corrosion of the anode. In an embodiment,
the anode is stable or corrosion resistant to the current carried by air-derived species such as
oxygen species such as Off, HOOH, OOH-, 0-, 09, and 02-. The corrosion resistant anode
may be one of the disclosure. Alternatively, the cathode may comprise a stable species such
as an oxide or sulfide such as NiO or MoS. In an embodiment, the cell voltage per cell
during the intermittent electrolysis and discharge is maintained above the potential that
prevents the anode from substantially oxidizing such as about 0.8 V in the case of a Ni anode.
                                                69

         From the perspective of thermodynamics, a species such as a negative ion may be
ionized at the anode and the same species created by reduction at the discharge cathode with
power dissipated in an external circuit when the ion or electron temperature at the anode is
greater than that at the cathode.       A non-hydrino example involving the temperature
differential of the half-cells is the cell [Na (hot)/BASE/Na (cold)].       Exemplary ions in a
LiOH-LiBr salt are OH- and Br- that may be oxidized to OH and Br, respectively, and
reduced with electrons delivered to the cathode through the external circuit. Alternatively,
species comprising at least one of 0 and H may carry the ion current. The hydrino reaction
provides the energy equivalent to heat to generate the power delivered to the circuit. In an
embodiment, the matrix serves as a separator to prevent the cathode and anode electrodes or
half-cells from shorting. The prevented shorting may be in at least one of the thermodynamic
and electrical sense. The matrix may separate the half-cell reactions to increase the rate,
effectiveness, or extent of the hydrino reaction to create an electromotive force (EMF) at the
anode relative to the cathode to drive current through the external circuit. In an embodiment,
the separation of the anode and cathode-half cell reactions causes a better match of the energy

the LiOH is a source of H 2 0 from 2LiOH to Li 2 0 + H 2 0 wherein the H may be converted to
hydrinos. The dehydration of LiOH may be catalyzed by oxygen ions from the reduction of
02  that ultimately reacts with the anode metal such as Ni to form an oxide such as NiO.
         In an embodiment of an electrolytic cell comprising hydroxide electrolyte such as an
aqueous or molten hydroxide or mixture such as an alkali hydroxide such as LiOH, H 2 is
generated at the cathode, and 02 is generated at the anode by electrolysis of H20. The
hydroxide of the electrolyte may be formed by solution an aqueous base such as a carbonate

one of the reactions of the oxidation of OH- to H2 0 in the presence of H at the cathode and
the reduction of at least one of 02 and H 2 0 to OH- at the anode occurs with the formation of
hydrinos. In an embodiment, the oxygen formed at the anode is reduced with H 2 0 to OH- at
the anode, and the H2 formed at the cathode reacts with OH- as it is oxidized to H2 0 at the
cathode such that the OH- pathway occurs at the anode and cathode according to Eqs. (92)
and (90), respectively. The catalyst may be H2 0 formed at the cathode that reacts with the H
also formed at the cathode. The cathode may be a metal that forms a hydride such as a noble
metal such as Pd, Pt, V, Ta, or Au, or a transition metal or alloy such as Ni or LaNi5 . The

electrolyte additive or matrix. The hydrino reaction current contribution is in the direction
opposite that of the electrolysis current and may result in additional heat production in the
cell. In an embodiment, the current is reversed intermittently during change and discharge
phases of a cycle. In another embodiment, at least one gas may crossover between half-cells
such that at least one of reactions given by Eqs. (90) and (92) occur to form hydrinos. The

the cell such that the OH- system given by Eq. (92) at least partially occurs at the cathode and
the OH- system given by Eq. (90) at least partially occurs at the anode. The catalyst may be
H2 0 formed at the anode from crossover H that reacts with the additional H that crosses over
from the cathode to the anode. The anode may be a metal that forms a hydride such as a
noble metal such as Pd, Pt, or Au, or a transition metal or alloy such as Ni or LaNi5 that
performs as a bifunctional electrode to oxidize the aqueous electrolyte to 02 and oxidize OH
to H2 0 in the presence of crossover hydrogen. The cathode may be a metal that forms a
hydride such as a noble metal such as Pd, Pt, or Au, or a transition metal or alloy such as Ni
or LaNi5 . The cathode may perform as a bifunctional electrode to reduce H2 0 to H 2 and may
additionally reduce at least one of crossover 02 and H2 0 to OH-. Thus, the cathode may
comprise at least one of an oxygen and H2 0 reduction catalyst. At least one of electrical and
thermal energy is released by the crossover reactions wherein the current has the same
polarity as that of the electrolysis current, but the voltage is of the opposite polarity. Thus, in
the case that constant current electrolysis is performed, in an embodiment, the cell voltage
decreases and the cell temperature increases.                  An exemplary electrolysis cell is [Pt/LiOH
0. IM to saturated aq/Pd]. In other embodiments, both electrodes are Ni or one is Ni and the

Co/KOH (aq)/NiO].
        In an embodiment, the aqueous electrolyte may comprise a mixture of at least one
hydroxide and at least one halide such as a mixture of alkali metal or alkaline earth
hydroxides and halides such as aqueous LiOH-LiBr. An exemplary cell is aqueous CIHT cell
[Ni or Pt/Ti/LiOH-LiBr (aq)/Ni].
        In embodiments, the water added to the cell or aqueous solvent may comprise H2 0,
D20, T2 0, or water mixtures and isotope mixtures. In an embodiment, the temperature is
controlled to control the rate of the hydrino reaction and consequently the power of the CIHT
cell. A suitable temperature range is about ambient to 100'C. The temperature may be
maintained about >100'C by sealing the cell so that pressure is generated and boiling is
suppressed.
        In an embodiment such as at least one comprising a molten salt or aqueous
electrolytic cell, the cell is charged at a constant voltage per cell that corresponds to the
negative of the cell potential for the reaction of H2 and 02 to H20. The charging potential
may comprise the H2 0 electrolysis potential having overpotential as well as thermodynamic
voltage components. The cell may also be charged at a constant current, power, or load, or a
variable voltage, current, power, or load.      The cell may then be discharged at constant
voltage, current, power, or load. The constant voltage may be achieved using a load that
maintains the desired discharge voltage. In other embodiments, the discharge may be at a
variable voltage, current, power, or load that may be controlled with at least one of a voltage,
current, power, and load controller. The voltage and current parameters may comprise a
ramp in either direction such as from a minimum to a maximum while charging and a
maximum to a minimum while discharging, for example. In an embodiment, the discharge is
under conditions that maximize the hydrino reaction rate by matching the half-cell reduction
potentials to those that achieve the optimization.       In an embodiment, the discharge is
maintained at a constant voltage per cell that corresponds to cell potential for the reaction H2
and 02 to H 20.         The matching potential may comprise overpotential as well as
thermodynamic voltage components. In other embodiments, at least one of the voltage and
current is variable to achieve the discharge voltage that causes the hydrino catalyst reaction to
occur at the maximum rate. The cell potential is the difference of the half-cell reduction
potentials that may comprise overpotential as well as thermodynamic voltage components.
The frequency and other charge-discharge parameters may be adjusted to maximize the
hydrino catalysis reaction rate. In an embodiment, the waveform of the cycle is conditioned
                                                87

to match a suitable load or a load is matched to the waveform. In an embodiment, the charge
discharge frequency may be that of the standard such as that of the power grid.             The
frequency may be 50 Hz, or it may be 60 Hz.             The waveform may be conditioned to
alternating current such as alternating current at 60 Hz or 50 Hz. The frequency may involve
reciprocal charging between two cells that are out of phase of the charge-discharge cycle such
that one may charge another and vice versa. In another embodiment, the current may be
rectified. The current may be supplied to a load during the discharge as direct current that
may be about constant current. Multiple CIHT cells may be timed to provide constant current
over durations longer than that of the cycle of any given individual cell.
         In an embodiment, the cell generates at least one of hydrogen and oxygen from H2 0.
In an embodiment, the H2 and 02 may be formed on the discharge anode and cathode,
respectively, during intermittent electrolysis. Alternatively, the gases are formed from H2 0
spontaneously that may be independent of electrolysis. The energy to drive the spontaneous
production of at least one of H2 and 02 from H2 0 is the formation of hydrinos. At least one
of the gases, H2 and 02, are reactants to form at least one of the catalyst and hydrinos. The
mechanism may involve at least one of an electrochemical and an ionization reaction. The
catalyst such as H 2 0 may be formed during discharge that further reacts with H to form
hydrinos. The reaction to form H2 0 during discharge may be reversible at any stage of the
cell operation such that H is formed at the discharge anode directly and, optionally,
independent of that formed by electrolysis. In addition or alternatively, to the electrolysis of
H 2 0 to H2 and 02 at the discharge anode and cathode, respectively, H formation may be
spontaneous due to the energy that is released to form hydrinos wherein both reactions may
occur simultaneously. In an embodiment, the cell voltage is such that the electrolysis of H2 0
occurs spontaneously with hydrino formation. The hydrino reaction may at least partially
maintain or support the cell voltage that achieves at least one of propagation of the
electrolysis of H2 0 and propagation of the hydrino formation reaction. In an embodiment,
the cell voltage is about 0.8 ± 0.5V. The exemplary cell comprising [Ni/LiOH-LiBr with
optional matrix such as MgO/Ni] and a supply of H2 0 may be operated in the temperature
range of about 280-500 'C with a cell voltage of about 0.8 V ± 0.2V. The voltage may be
assisted by at least one of intermittent electrolysis and spontaneous electrolysis with hydrino
formation. An exemplary cell waveform of the intermittent electrolysis may comprise a step
of charge to 0.8 V ± 0.2V and maintain that voltage for a set time as the cell discharges. The
cell waveform may further discharge the cell under conditions such as at a constant current to
a limiting voltage such as 0.6 V ± 0.2V or for a limiting time such as 4s ± 3s. The
spontaneous electrolysis of H2 0 may have one or more intermediate steps that involve a
reaction of at least one of the anode material, the electrolyte, and a solid, liquid, and gas in
the cell.    For example, H2 0 may react with the anode metal M to form MO and H 2.
Exemplary solids, liquids, and gases are solid matrix such as MgO, LiAlO 2, Li2 TiO 3 , LiVO 3 ,

Eqs. (97), (99), (102), (104), and (105) may react to form H 2 0 and O-         according to Eqs.

HOO- and reactions given in the disclosure such as (Eqs. (61-79)) may be involved in the
spontaneous electrolysis of H2 0 to form a source of at least one of H, catalyst, and hydrinos.
In an embodiment, H may be formed at the discharge anode and cathode wherein hydrinos
are preferentially formed at one electrode such as the anode since the catalyst is formed there.
An exemplary cell is one having a Ni discharge anode and a NiO discharge cathode wherein
hydrinos are preferentially formed at the Ni electrode. In addition to the reactions supra, the
reaction at the discharge cathode may be reduction of H2 0 to O-     and H 2, and the reaction at

such as a metal oxide such as NiO may be reduced at the cathode. The reduction may also
include other reactants such as H20.        Exemplary reduction reactions are NiO to Ni and
negative ions comprising oxygen such as oxide, peroxide, and superoxide and reduction of
NiO and H2 0 to Ni and hydroxide. Additionally, in an embodiment, the catalyst such as H2 0

embodiment wherein the spontaneous generation of H and then hydrinos is sufficient to
maintain a desired electrical output from the cell.      H 2 0 may be supplied to the cell to

hydrogen from intermittent or spontaneous electrolysis may be collected for another
commercial use. In an embodiment, the excess current maintained by the energy from the
hydrino reaction may be manifest as or propagate as the spontaneous electrolysis of water as
exemplified by the reactions of Eqs. (97-107).       In an embodiment, the hydrino reactions
involving the conversion of H2 0 to hydrinos, electricity, and oxygen or compounds or
species comprising oxygen may comprise hydrolysis reactions.
        In an embodiment, the water vapor pressure is controlled to maintain spontaneous
electrolysis reactions. The water vapor pressure or composition of the reaction mixture may
be maintained to support the ions that maintain the spontaneous electrolysis such as at least
one of O-, oxide, peroxide, superoxide, and HOO-.              Certain ions are preferentially
maintained to favor the electrolysis of water, the formation of catalyst and H, and the
formation of hydrinos. In the exemplary reactions of Eqs. (97-107), the water vapor pressure
is maintain to support a steady state concentration of superoxide ion for the corresponding
reaction pathway to form hydrinos. The water vapor pressure may be controlled using a
water vapor or steam generator wherein the temperature of the water reservoir is maintained
at the lowest temperature of the system. The system may comprise the water generator, the
water vapor line to the cell, and the cell. The water vapor pressure in equilibrium or at steady

as formation of an oxide coat. The oxide coat may effect the over potential of at least one
half-cell reaction to cause the hydrino formation reaction to become more favorable.

The source of hydrogen may be from dehydration of a hydroxide electrolyte such as LiOH
wherein the corresponding reaction to provide H 2 0 as a source of H is 2LiOH to Li 2 0 + H 2 0.
The cell may be run under intermittent charge-discharge or continuous discharge conditions
without H2 0 being supplied wherein the electrolyte may be rehydrated in a batch manner. At
least one operating parameter such as the temperature of the cell may be changed before and

no H 2 0, the electrolyte may be re-hydrated intermittently.
         In the case that the electrode material is soluble in the electrolyte, a corrosion
inhibitor may be added. The inhibitor may comprise a compound such as an oxyanion or a
halide comprising the metal of the anode such as Mo, W, Hf, Ta, and a transition metal such a
Ti. For example, a Mo anode with an electrolyte comprising LiOH may become oxidized to
form MoO 2 , Li 2 MoO 3 , or Li 2MoO 4 that is soluble in alkaline. This product may be allowed
to reach saturation or added to the electrolyte to achieve saturation to inhibit corrosion. In an
embodiment, the concentration of Li 2 MoO 3 or Li 2 MoO 4 is about 0.1 to 10 wt% or about 0.5
to 3 wt%. Alternatively, an additive further inhibits corrosion such as lithium borate, lithium
silicate, MgO, MoX. (X = halide, n = integer) such as MoBr 2 or MoBr 3, MoS 2 , MoSe 2,
MoTe 2, Bi 3 M'Mo 2 0 12 wherein M' may comprise a transition metal such as Fe or Sc,
M'MoO 4 wherein M' may comprise an alkaline earth or transition metal such as Mg, Ca, Sr,
Ba, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, and Zn, or M' 2 MoO 4 wherein M' is an alkali metal.              M'MoO 4 or
M' 2 MoO 4 may further serve as a source of catalyst with the formation of M(OH) 2 or M'OH,
respectively, wherein OH- may react with H to form catalyst H 20.             The additive may
comprise a polyanion such as one of W or Mo such as a polytungstate or polymolybdate ion
or compound.       In an embodiment, at least one of the anode, cathode, or an electrolyte
component may comprise a W or Mo bronze. The bronze may comprise MxW0               3 or MxMo0   3
(x<1) wherein M is a metal cation such as an alkali or alkaline earth metal such as Li. The
bronze may comprise a high surface area material.           The bronze may be formed by tape
casting. The tape casing may be on a substrate such as metal foam such as Ni, Mo, or W
metal foam such as Ni celmet. The tape cast reactants to form the bronze may be heated.
The heating may in a reducing atmosphere or comprise a reductive heating reaction such as
those known in the art. In an exemplary method W bonze is formed by reducing a mixture of
Li 2 WO 4 and W0    3 with H 2 at red heat. Alternatively, tungsten bronze may be formed by a
number of reductive techniques such as heating normal tungstates with tungsten metal. Mo
bronze may be formed similarly by substituting Mo for W and other methods known by those
skilled in the art. Exemplary cells are [molybdenum or tungsten bronze/LiOH-LiBr MgO
spacer/NiO + 02 + H20], [Mo-molybdenum bronze/LiOH-LiBr MgO spacer/NiO + 02 +
H20], and [W-tungsten bronze/LiOH-LiBr MgO spacer/NiO + 02 + H20].                         In an
                                                 101

embodiment, the additive may shift the potential of the Nernst equation to favor the
formation of water rather than the oxidation of the anode metal. In another embodiment,
MoO 2 , Li 2 MoO 3 , or Li 2 MoO 4 additive comprises a matrix material wherein an electrode such
as the anode may comprise a metal or conductor other than Mo. An exemplary cell is
[Ni/LiOH-LiBr + MoO 2 , Li 2 MoO 3 , or Li 2 MoO4/Ni + air; intermittent electrolysis].     In an
embodiment, the cathode may comprise a compound comprising the metal of the anode such
as Mo.      An exemplary cell is [Mo/LiOH-LiBr /Mo 6 Se 8 or molybdenum oxyhydroxide
intermittent electrolysis]. In an embodiment, the cathode and anode may comprise a source
of the same metal, alloy, or element that may migrate from one electrode to the other. The
anode and cathode may be reverse periodically during intermittent charge discharge such that
the discharge anode becomes the discharge cathode periodically.            Exemplary migrating
metals, alloys, or elements are Cd, Ni, CdNi, Mo, and MoNi. Since Mo dissolves in base and
Ni does not, an exemplary embodiment having a Mo matrix such as a Li 2 MoO 4 matrix with
Ni anode      is [Ni/LiOH-LiBr        (Li 2 MoO 4  matrix)/Ni-NiO  both electrodes     submerged
intermittent electrolysis].     In an embodiment, a compound that forms a stable alloy at the
anode may be added to the electrolyte. One example is a soluble Ni compound such as NiBr 2
that forms a stable MoNi alloy with a Mo anode in a cell comprising a Mo anode such as
[Mo/LiOH-LiBr NiBr 2/Ni-NiO intermittent electrolysis].
        In an embodiment, an oxidized discharge anode may be regenerated by applying a
negative potential to reduce the discharge anode. Electrolysis may be performed at a higher
negative voltage than typical to cause the regeneration. Thus, the discharge anode is made an
electrolysis cathode for the regeneration step. Hydrogen may be generated during this step to
also contribute to the reduction of excess oxide so that the anode may be restored to a
functional state. The magnitude of the applied cell voltage may be in the range of about 0.5
V to 5 V or about 1 V to 2 V, or about 1 V to 1.5 V. In an exemplary embodiment, a cell
such as [Mo/LiOH-LiBr-Li 2MoO 4/NiO air] comprises a Mo anode wherein Mo is
electroplated onto the anode by at least intermittently applying a voltage sufficient to cause
the electroplating to occur. In an embodiment, the cell charge and discharge voltage range
during intermittent electrolysis is selected and controlled to prevent the anode from corroding
at an undesirable rate.        The voltage may be determined using the Nernst equation for
corrosion reactions wherein the voltage may be maintained above a voltage at which the rate
of corrosion reactions are appreciable. In an embodiment, the negative lead is attached to the
electrolyte face of the anode to maintain the negative potential at the anode electrolyte
interface.
        In an embodiment, the corrosion of at least one electrode is reduced or prevented by
controlling at least one of the corresponding half-cell and cell potential. The intermittent
charge and discharge and discharge waveform may be controlled to reduce or prevent
oxidation of the electrode such as the anode. The waveform may adjusted based on at least
                                                  102

one of the electrode and electrolyte composition and the concentrations or pressures of
species supplied to the cell or generated in the cell such as 02 and H2 0. In an embodiment,
the reaction product of at least one electrode with at cell species such as least one of oxygen
and the electrolyte is added as an additive to suppress the electrode corrosion reaction. The
suppression may be by reducing the Nernst voltage to be less in magnitude than the
corresponding half-cell or cell voltage. Exemplary anode components and the corresponding
additives are Mo or Mo alloy and MoO 2 , MoO 3 , or Li 2 MoO 4 , Ti or Al such as an alloy such
as AlTi and TiO 2 , Li 2 TiO 3 , A12 0 3 or LiAlO 2, carbon or a carbide such as Mo 2 C and Li 2 CO 3 , a
boride such as MoB and B 2 0      3  or Li 2 B 4 0 7 , a silicide such as MoSi 2 and SiO 2 or Li 2 SiO 3 . The
corrosion may be further suppressed by controlling at least one of the oxygen and H2 0
pressure, and cell temperature, and by addition of a gas such as CO 2 or N2 in the case of an
anode comprising a carbide or nitride, respectively. The cell temperature may be controlled
to optimize the cell kinetics and at least one of the half-cell and cell voltages.                   The cell
temperature may be reduced to control corrosion. The temperature may be reduced by the
selection of an electrolyte with a lower melting point. For example, the melting point of a
LiOH-LiBr electrolyte may be reduced by adding some NaOH, KOH, or RbOH.                                    The
alternative hydroxide will also increase the oxygen reduction rate.
         In an embodiment, a corrosion inhibitor may be added to the cell. In an embodiment,
the product of the anode oxidation reaction is added to the electrolyte. The product may
change the Nernst potential to suppress the corrosion wherein the waveform may be adjusted
to match the potential change to facilitate the suppression of corrosion. In an embodiment,
the waveform may be controlled to electroplate the corrosion product during the intermittent
charge phase. The waveform may be controlled to optimize the net electrical energy balance
considering an input energy to electrolysis of the corrosion product. The waveform may be
optimized relative to the concentration of the corrosion product added or generated insitu.
The waveform may comprise optimal time intervals and voltages to electroplate out each
constituent anode metal ion from the electrolyte to the anode. The waveform and additive
concentrations may be adjusted to take advantage of voltage and kinetic parameters of plating
additives or products to maintain a desire electrode alloy composition. In an embodiment
having an anode that oxidize to produce more than one metal ion, the metal ion ratios of the
electrolyte are controlled to maintain one that gives at least one of the highest net power and
the most energy efficiency with a corresponding waveform.                        A corresponding desired
waveform and electrolyte composition comprising additives may be determined by cyclic
voltametry.
         In an embodiment, the electrolyte may comprise a halide compound of the anode.
The cation of the compound may provide a common ion effect to suppress the corrosion of
the anode. An exemplary anode is a transition element such as Ni or Co and the halide
compound may be NiBr 2 or CoBr 2, respectively. The electrolyte may be aqueous or a molten
                                                         103

salt such as those of the disclosure.           In an exemplary embodiment, the compound that
provides the common ion or reacts to form a common having a common ion is at least one of
Li 2 SO 4 and Li 2 PO 4 and CoSO 4 and CoPO 4 . The matrix may comprise a common ion of the
anode corrosion product such as an oxide ion.                 The oxide may comprise those of the
disclosure.     In an exemplary embodiment, MgO provides a common 02- ion to suppress
corrosion of the anode such as the corrosion of a transition element anode to the oxide such
as Co or Ni to CoO or NiO, respectively. In another embodiment, the matrix comprises a
compound comprising an oxide of the anode and another compound such as at least one
matrix compound of the disclosure. Exemplary compounds are cobalt magnesium oxide that
may serve as the matrix and may prevent formation of cobalt oxide from a cobalt anode. This
matrix may provide common ions of Co and 02- to prevent corrosion of anode. In another
embodiment Ni or Cu replaces Co. The anode may comprise NiCo. In an embodiment, the
source of the common ion oxide is at least one of CuO, Cr04, ZnO, MgO, CaO, MoO 2 , Ti0 2 ,

of CoO, NiO, and MoO 2 . The matrix such as at least one of those of the disclosure may be
soluble in the electrolyte such that it does not precipitate on at least one electrode.

metals such as TZM, H242, MoNi, MoCo, MoCu, MoFe, FeMoCo, MoV, MoCr, MoMn,

additional transition metals or other metals and compounds comprise other anode
embodiments. In an embodiment, the cell voltage per cell during the intermittent electrolysis
and discharge is maintained above the potential that prevents the anode from substantially

anode from forming at least one of an oxide and a compound comprising at least one element
of the electrolyte. In a CIHT cell embodiment comprising an anode comprising Mo or a Mo
alloy, the voltage range is maintained to prevent formation of at least one of MoO 2 , MoO 3 ,
Li 2 MoO 3 , and Li 2 MoO 4 , and other Mo oxides or compounds.                    The voltage may be
determined using the Nernst equation for corrosion reactions wherein the voltage may be
maintained above a voltage at which the rate of corrosion reactions are appreciable.                              In
exemplary embodiments, the lower voltage limit is about that for the formation of the oxide
or an oxide compound wherein the standard potentials at 800 K for the formation directly or

The standard voltages may be altered according to the Nernst equation for the corresponding
reaction(s) by changing the reactant and product concentrations and operating temperature as
known by those skilled in the art. For example, the lower limit voltage to reduce corrosion
such as at least one of E0 of Eqs. (109-116) may be reduced by addition of at least one of
MoO 2 , MoO 3 , Li2 MoO 3 , Li 2 MoO 4 , Li 2 0, and H 2, and by reduction of 02.  The voltage limit
for the reduction of MoO 2 may be reduced by increasing the temperature wherein an
exemplary cell temperature is above 300 C.               An exemplary intermittent charge-discharge
range at about 800K with the appropriate reactant and product concentrations maintained to
avoid corrosion according to the Nernst equation are at least one of in the range of about 0.5V
to 2V, about 0.6V to 1.5V, about 0.7V to 1.3V, about 0.8V to 1.2V, about 0.8V to 1.LV,

voltage range would change at a different operating temperature.            For example, from the
standard reduction potentials (M. S. Antleman, F. J. Harris, Encyclopedia of Chemical
electrode Potentials, Plenum Press, NY, (1982)) for the half-cell reactions at STP, the voltage
to reduce molybdate ion to Mo is 1.45 V:

In an embodiment, the cathode material and the concentration or pressure of the cathode half
cell reactants and products such as         02,    H 20, and hydroxide are controlled to achieve a
cathode half-cell voltage that with the anode half-cell reaction and voltage provides a cell
voltage that at least reduces the corrosion of the anode. The cathode material may be Ni or
NiO and may further comprise oxides of other metals such those of Cr, Mn, Co, Fe, V, and
Ag as well as other transition metals, rare earth metals, inner transition metals, and metalloids
to control the cathode half-cell voltage. Additionally, at least one of the degree of alkali ion
                                                      105

doping such as lithiation, oxidation, and surface area may be controlled to control the cathode
voltage contribution.
          In an embodiment, the voltage for the oxidation reaction of the anode material and
that of hydrogen are essentially the same. An exemplary anode material is Mo for which Eo
to form Mo oxide is about 1.1 V at 800K, a match to Eo of the reaction of hydrogen and
oxygen to H 2 0 at 800K. The match may be within +/- 30%, +/- 20%, +/- 10%, +/- 5%, or +/
 1%.     The match may be controlled by changing the concentration of at least one of the
reactants and products and the temperature according to the Nernst equation. The match may
be further controlled by doping the metal of the anode with at least one other metal. The
doping may comprise an alloy. Exemplary alloys are Mo alloys such as MoNi, MoCo,
MoCu, MoFe, CoMoFe, TZM, and H242. The alloy may comprise Mo or Mo and at least
one other element such as at least one transition metal such as Fe and Co and further
comprise at least one of sulfur and oxygen. In an embodiment, each component of the alloy
may have the voltage that matches that of hydrogen oxidation. An exemplary material is an
anode comprising Mo and Fe such as MoFe alloy or mixture wherein Eo to form MoO 2 and
Fe 2 0 3 are both about 1.1 V at 800K. In an embodiment, the match of voltages of electrode
oxidation and hydrogen oxidation regards an aqueous cell. The cell may have an operating
temperature below 100'C. An exemplary electrode for the hydrino reaction is a nickel
electrode such as a Ni cathode of an aqueous electrolysis cell or an anode of a CIHT cell
since the voltage for nickel oxidation at 298K is about 1.1 V, being about the same voltage as
H 2 combustion at 298K.
          In an embodiment, the cell is operated at a voltage or within a voltage range that
avoids the reduction of a protective oxide coat such as that of a Mo electrode such as that of
the anode. In another embodiment, the voltage is maintained within a range that controls a
desired oxide thickness.     The voltage range is maintained by controlling the charge and
discharge waveform. The voltage may be further maintained above that at which excessive
corrosion occurs. An excessively thick oxide coat may form at a voltage below the desired
lower limit. In exemplary embodiments, the upper limit is about that of the formation of the
oxide or an oxide compound wherein the standard potentials at 800 K for the formation
directly or as the corresponding sum of reactions are about E0 within +/- 0.5V, 0.25 V, or 0.1
V of the reactions of Eqs. (109-116). The standard voltages may be altered according to the
Nernst equation for the corresponding reaction(s) by changing the reactant and product
concentrations and operating temperature as known by those skilled in the art. An exemplary
intermittent charge-discharge range with the appropriate reactant and product concentrations
maintained to avoid corrosion according to the Nernst equation are at least one of in the range
of about 0.2V to 1.3V, about 0.2V to IV, about 0.2V to 0.9V, about 0.2V to 0.8V, about 0.2V
to 0.75V, about 0.2V to 0.7V, about 0.4V to IV, about 0.5V to IV, about 0.6V to IV, about
0.7V to IV, about 0.8V to IV, about 0.4V to 0.9V, about 0.5V to 0.9V, about 0.6V to 0.9V,
                                               106

about 0.7V to 0.9V, about 0.8V to 0.9V, about 0.4V to 0.8V, about 0.5V to 0.8V, about 0.6V
to 0.8V, and about 0.7V to 0.8V.
         In an embodiment, at least one electrode such as the anode may be protected from
corrosion. The corrosion-protected electrode such as the anode may comprise an alloy such
as an alloy of Ni such as NiCr or Mo such as MoNi or MoC. The cell may comprise a
catalyst to convert a reactive oxygen reduction product such as peroxide or ions thereof or
superoxide to hydroxide to protect at least one electrode such as the anode from corrosion. A
suitable catalyst is a noble metal such as Pt or Pd that may be on a support such as A12 0 3 or
carbon. Other suitable catalysts are Co or Fe species. Alternatively, H 20 addition may be
used to convert the peroxide or superoxide to hydroxide. The Mo anode may be embedded in
the catalyst or supported catalyst to form hydroxide such as Pt/A120 3.
         Anode corrosion by peroxide and other reactive oxygen species may be avoided by
using a corrosion resistant alloy such as one comprising Ni such as NiMo.            Peroxide
corrosion can also be prevented by using a submerged cathode or otherwise limiting the 02
pressure with a controlled gas atmosphere or a solid electrolyte layer serving as an air
diffusion barrier. In an embodiment wherein 02 in the cell atmosphere is limited or excluded,
the cathode is not submerged. The kinetics may be maintained by using an electrolyte salt
mixture that has the appropriate oxygen reduction rate considering the oxygen reduction rate
trend LiOH~NaOH<<KOH. The rate may also be controlled with temperature wherein the
rate is reduced with lower temperature and vice versa. The peroxide concentration can be
reduced by using a cathode comprising an oxygen reduction catalyst that favors the Off,
four-electron reduction, pathway over the peroxide, two-electron reduction, pathway. The
former is favored with a higher H2 0 pressure since water is a reactant. Also, water reacts
with peroxide ions and deactivates them by conversion to Off. Additionally, a peroxide to
hydroxide conversion catalyst could be used at the anode or cathode to protect the anode
from peroxide corrosion. Pt such as Pt/A120 3 or an Fe species such as an iron halide or a Co
species such as cobalt perovskites may serve as the conversion catalyst. The anode may also
be protected by providing a species to react with reactive oxygen intermediates or by
chemically protecting the anode.       For example, a reductive reactant such as additional
hydrogen may be provided at the anode by means such as application of a H2 atmosphere or
by hydrogen permeation.       An additive such as MoO 2 that reacts with peroxide to form
Mo0 4 2 - for example or CO 2 that reacts to CO 3 2- and 1/202 are other exemplary reactants.
Suppression of anode metal corrosion may be achieved by amalgamating the metal with Hg
such as up to 50%. An exemplary amalgam anode is AgHg.
         In an embodiment, a corrodible anode such as Mo or TZM is coated with a protective
layer such as one of MoS 2 , MoSe 2, or Teflon. In another embodiment, the charge voltage of
the intermittent electrolysis cycle is high enough to cause some metal dissolved in the
electrolyte from the anode or added to the electrolyte as a compound such as a salt to be
                                               107

electroplated onto the anode. In the case that the anode comprises Mo or a Mo alloy such as
MoNi or MoCu, the added salt may be a molybdate compound such as Li 2 MoO 3 or Li 2 MoO 4.
Compounds of the anode metals may be added to the cell. For example, oxides of the metals
of the anode may be added and electroplated onto the anode. The oxides for replating may
also be from corrosion of the anode. The electrolyte may comprise a molten eutectic salt that
may comprise a hydroxide. The electrolyte may comprise a molten eutectic salt such as an
alkali halide salt mixture to which a hydroxide is added. An exemplary electrolyte is LiCl
KCl or LiCl-KCl-LiF to which LiOH is added. The LiOH may be a minority species. The
additive may be Li 2 MoO 3 or Li 2 MoO 4 . The mole% may be any desired or in the range of
about 0.1 to 20 mole% or about 1 to 3 mole %. The electrode may be Mo or another metal
such as Ni onto which Mo is electroplated. The cell voltage may be in the range of about 0.7
V to 3V. The cell voltage may be higher than 0.8V to re-electroplate the Mo. The cell
voltage may be the range of about 0.9 to 2 V or about greater than 1.14 V.                         In an
embodiment, the electrolysis may be performed at multiple voltages such as a first to
electroplate the anode metal and a second to generate hydrogen. In an embodiment, the
anode metal forms a soluble compound or complex such as a hydroxide ion complex. The
metal may be electroplated onto the anode during the electrolysis phase of the intermittent
cycle.    Suitable complexes are Zn(OH) 42 , Sn(OH) 42 , Sn(OH)6 2 , Pb(OH) 42 , Cr(OH)4-,
Al(OH)4-, and Sb(OH) 4- wherein the discharge anode comprises the corresponding metal.
Suitable exemplary metals to be replated from the electrolyte are Cu, Ni, NiCu, Pb, Sb, Bi,
Co, Cd, Ge, Au, Ir, Fe, Hg, Mo, Os, Pd, Re, Rh, Ru, Se, Ag, Te, Tl, and Sn.
         Water soluble MoO4- forms upon reaction of Mo with oxygen and water. In an
embodiment such as one comprising an aqueous or molten salt electrolyte, at least one of the
source of oxygen and H2 0 are controlled to suppress the formation of Mo oxides such as
MoO4-. The source of oxygen may be hydroxide ion wherein the activity may be controlled
by providing a reactant that competes for the hydroxide ion in the formation of an alternative
product. The reactant may be a metal ion such as at least one of Zn, Sn, Pb, Cr, Al, and Sb.
The reactant may be a compound such as a hydroxide. The hydroxide may form a complex
ion such as a hydroxide complex ion. In an exemplary embodiment, the effective OH
concentration or activity may be changed by adding a metal hydroxide such as Zn(OH) 2 that
forms a complex such as Zn(OH) 42 .               Suitable complexes are Zn(OH) 42 , Sn(OH) 42
Sn(OH) 62 , Pb(OH) 42 , Cr(OH)4-, Al(OH) 4 , and Sb(OH) 4 . The stability of the ion complex
may at least one of thermodynamically or kinetically suppress the formation of a Mo oxide or
compound comprising Mo such a Li 2 MoO 4 .                  Suitable complex ion hydroxides are
Li 2 Zn(OH) 4 , Na 2Zn(OH) 4 , Li 2 Sn(OH) 4 , Na 2 Sn(OH) 4 , Li 2 Pb(OH) 4 , Na 2Pb(OH) 4 , LiSb(OH) 4 ,
NaSb(OH) 4, LiAl(OH) 4, NaAl(OH) 4, LiCr(OH) 4, NaCr(OH) 4 , Li 2 Sn(OH)6 , and Na 2Sn(OH)6 .
Additional exemplary suitable hydroxides are at least one from Co(OH) 2, Zn(OH) 2, Ni(OH) 2,
other transition metal hydroxides, Cd(OH) 2, Sn(OH) 2, and Pb(OH).
                                                     108

        The reactive H 2 0 concentration or activity may be controlled by adding a reactant that
binds H 2 0 such as a hydroscopic compound such as at least one of KMgCl 3 , MgCl 2 , and
CaCl 2. In an embodiment, a component of the electrolyte such as an alkali halide binds H 2 0.
An exemplary hydroscopic species that may serve as an electrolyte salt is LiBr.
        In an embodiment, the anode is protected from corrosion with a hydrogen atmosphere.
The hydrogen may be provided by applying hydrogen gas or by hydrogen permeation
through a membrane that may at least partially comprise the anode.          Hydrogen protection
may also be provided by concentration of the hydrogen formed in situ such as by intermittent
electrolysis. The anode comprises at least one type of H binding center such as metal centers
and at least one support wherein the support permits the mobility of hydrogen generated on
the corresponding center surface to move to and preferentially bind to the centers to increase
the effective H atom concentration on those centers.       Suitable exemplary centers are metals
such as anode metals and alloys of the disclosure such as Mo, Ni, Pd, and Pt, and suitable
exemplary supports are those of the disclosure such as carbon, carbides, nitrides, and borides.
Exemplary cell are [carbon, Ni carbon, Mo carbon, NiMo carbon, PtC, PdC/LiOH
LiBr/steam carbon (SC), NiO, PtNiO, or AgNiO; air cathode or submerged cathode].              The
cell may comprise an electrolyte matrix material such as Li 2 MoO 4 or a membrane spacer such
as Teflon. Exemplary cells are [carbon powder such as graphite, AC, carbon black, glassy
carbon, Vulcan XC-72 + Mo or Ni powder/ LiOH-LiBr/steam carbon] and [carbon powder +
Mo powder/Li 2MoO 4 + LiOH-LiBr/NiO].
        In an embodiment, the electrolyte comprises a hydroscopic compound such as a salt
that absorbs H 2 0 from a source such as the atmosphere.         The compound may maintain a
hydrated state to serve as the electrolyte of a CIHT cell. The hydrated electrolyte may be
ionic conductive at a temperature below that of the melting point of the dry salt such as a
eutectic mixture such as LiOH-LiBr.       The electrolyte may comprise a mixture of salts to
maintain a slurry such as a mixture of Li 2 CO 3 , Li 2 0, LiOH, and LiBr. Other hydroscopic
additives may be added such as those of the disclosure such as KMgCl 3, MgCl 2 , CaCl 2, and
KOH.      The hydrated compound may serve as the electrolyte for the interment electrolysis
cell.  Alternatively, the hydrogen electrode may comprise a hydrogen-sparging electrode.
The cell may be run at low temperature such as in the temperature range to room temperature
to the melting point of the non-hydrated electrolyte.
        Oxygen may be formed at the anode and hydrogen at cathode during electrolysis.         02
may be provided by sparging from a source such as       02 gas or air. During the electrolysis-off
or discharge phase,  02  and H 2 0 may undergo reduction at the electrolysis anode to form OH
(Eq. (92)) and OH- may be oxidized and reacted with H to form H 2 0 that may serve as a
catalyst to form hydrinos at the electrolysis cathode (Eq. (90). Thus, the cell may maintain a
constant polarity during charge and discharge with the polarity of the current reversing during
each phase of the cycle. The output may be power or waveform conditioned. In another
                                               109

embodiment, the reaction given by Eq. (90) occurs reversibly at both electrodes except that
the hydrino product is irreversible.       (The designation of the intermittent charge-discharge
cells    as     given     in  the disclosure     is    in discharge-mode    such    as    [discharge
anode/electrolyte/discharge cathode].        In an embodiment this designation corresponds to
[negative electrode/electrolyte/positive electrode], but the polarity may be reversed in other
embodiments. The current may reverse intermittently during discharge and charge phases of
the intermittent electrolysis cycle.) An exemplary cell is [Pt/LiOH 0. 1M to saturated aq/Pd +

concentration range of about 0. IM to saturated. Specific examples are [PtTi/K 2CO 3 or KOH

electrolysis may be performed at constant cell voltage such as about I to 1.6V or about 1.4 V
for a first period of time such as about I to 10 s or 2 s, and the discharge may be performed at
constant current such as about 0.01 to 10 mA/cm 2 or 0.2 mA/cm 2 for a second period of time
such as about 1 to 100 s or about 10 s. In an embodiment, such as one comprising an alkaline
electrolyte, having at least one long duration charge or discharge period such as >5 s, the
discharge anode comprises a material that forms a hydride during the electrolysis cycle such
as LaNi5 H6 or Pd.

and W. An exemplary discharge cathode reaction involving an oxyhydroxide is given by Eq.
(119).    The cathode may be recharged during the electrolysis phase of the intermittent
electrolysis.    The cell may comprise an intermittent electrolysis cell, permeation cell,
electrochemical discharge cell with chemical or electrolytic regeneration, a hydrogen
sparging cell, or combinations thereof.      In an embodiment, the permeation cell may be
intermittently discharged.

         In another embodiment, the gases may crossover from at least one of the anode to
cathode, and vice versa. Then, during discharge at least one of the half-cell reactions may be
switched such the   02 (Eq. (92) reduction occurs at the electrolysis cathode and OH- oxidation
and reaction with H (Eq. (90) occurs at the electrolysis anode. Then, the current polarity
remains constant, but the voltage polarity of the electrodes switches or its magnitude in the
same direction changes with the phase of the cycle. The electrode spacing may be minimized
to facilitate the gas crossover.   The electrodes may be separated by a membrane such as a
porous olefin membrane such as a Celgard or base-compatible Nafion membrane. The circuit
between the electrodes may comprise a diode to maintain the constant polarity of the current.
In embodiments, the power from forming hydrinos manifests as at least one of excess
electrical and thermal power over the dissipated electrolysis power.
         The hydrino catalyst H 2 0 having accepted 81.6 eV from H may decompose into H 2
and 1/202; consequently, a component of H 2 0 electrolysis may occur even when the
electrolysis voltage or current is absent.    This may be observed as a Faradaic efficiency
greater than 100% and may be a source of H 2 and     02 gases. Each of    02 and H 2 may react at
the corresponding electrolysis source electrode or at the corresponding counter electrode
following crossover. During the discharge phase of the intermittent discharge, the hydrino
supporting reactions of oxygen and hydrogen may be given by (Eq. (92)) and (Eq. (90)),
respectively. In other embodiments, other catalysts of the cell or formed during operation of
the cell may cause the electrolysis of water due to the ionization of the catalyst and energy
release during the catalysis reaction to form hydrinos.
         In an embodiment, the electrolysis cathode of the intermittently charged and
discharged cell may develop a thick non-conductive oxide coat. An exemplary coat on a Ni
electrode is NiO.     In an embodiment, the coat may be reduced by applying a suitable
reduction cell voltage such as in the range of about 1 V to 1.5V, in the case of NiO. The
reduction may be applied to the discharge anode.        The electrolysis may be maintained at
                                               111

constant voltage or a suitable voltage for a suitable time to adequately reduce the oxide coat
such that the electrode conductivity is substantially restored.    Then, the charge-discharge
cycle may be reapplied. In a high discharge current embodiment, the formation of an oxide
coating on the discharge anode is avoided by charging at a peak limiting voltage that may be
a constant voltage. The current may be limited during charging. In an embodiment wherein
at least the charging voltage and current are limited, the charging may be at constant power.
The discharge may be at a constant current, load, power, or voltage. In an embodiment, the
cell such as [Ni/LiOH-LiBr/Ni air, intermittently charge discharge] is charged in the cell
voltage rage of about 0.8 to 1.2 V such as constant 0.9V. Alternatively, the charging may be
at a limiting or peak constant power in the range of about 0.1 to 100 mW cm-2.              The
                                                                                          2
exemplary discharge current density may be in the range of about 0.001 to 1000 mA cm- , 0.1
to 100 mA cm -2 , and 1 to 10 mA cm -2. In an embodiment, the electrolysis cathode and anode
are interchanged to reduce any excessive oxide coat. The exchange may be intermittent. The
period may be different from that of the intermittent charge-discharge cycle of intermittent
electrolysis.   In an embodiment, both electrodes may be capable of hydrogen sparging
wherein the hydrogen is alternately supplied to one and then the other to reduce any excess
oxide coat that forms during its operation as an oxygen electrode. In an embodiment of a cell
such as [Ni/LiOH-LiBr/Ni + air intermittent; charge-discharge] an oxide coat such as a NiO
coat is removed mechanically or chemically by means known in the art. The removal may be
periodically with the electrode reused. In another embodiment, hydrogen is applied to a
chamber of a hydrogen permeable electrode such as the anode. The cell temperature may
below that at which a significant permeation rate occurs relative to the power generated by
the cell. However, the low flow or presence of hydrogen at the anode due to permeation may
protect the electrode from oxidation such as oxidation to form NiO. In another embodiment,
an electrode of the intermittent electrolysis cell is capable of and is operated as a hydrogen
permeation electrode wherein hydrogen is provided to the cell by permeation from a source
such as hydrogen gas; then, the electrode is switched to the electrolysis mode.          In an
embodiment, the switched electrode serves as the electrolysis cathode and discharge anode.
The pretreatment may condition the electrode to perform as desired in the intermittent
electrolysis mode. In an embodiment, intermittent electrolysis is performed as hydrogen is
simultaneously supplied to an electrode such as the discharge anode by means such as
permeation or sparging. Alternatively, an atmosphere comprising H2 may be provided to the
cell. The selectivity of the desired hydrogen reaction and counter electrode reaction such as
those of the disclosure may be achieved via the selectivity of the corresponding electrodes.
For example, the selectivity of the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction and anodic hydrogen
reaction with OH- to form H2 0 catalyst are made selective by the corresponding selectivity of
the cathode and anode, respectively. The hydrogen supplied to the anode may be protective
since the reaction
                                               112

        NiO + H2 to Ni + H2 0                                                            (120)
is favorable.   In another embodiment, the duty cycle for electrolysis is increased such that
sufficient hydrogen is generated to protect the discharge anode from corrosion.            The
parameters are selected to achieve energy gain such as electrical energy gain while generating
enough hydrogen to be protection against corrosion.        The cell temperature may also be
controlled to ameliorate corrosion while controlling the hydrogen supplied by means such as
permeation and electrolysis.     A discharge cathode that is resistant to corrosion may be
selected that is appropriate for the operating conditions of the cell. For a temperature less
than about 350 to 450 'C, the cathode may comprise Ni. For higher temperatures, a suitable
stable cathode may be used such as one comprising an oxide such as a NiO or CoO or
supported Ag such as Ag-A1 20 3.
         In an embodiment, the hydrogen supplied by permeation functions to at least one of
change the voltage of the cell and control the permeation rate by a feedback mechanism that
may be based on the effect of the permeation rate on the cell voltage. In an embodiment, the
cell voltage is adjusted by adjusting the hydrogen permeation rate. The permeation rate may
be adjusted by means such as at least one of controlling the cell temperature, the hydrogen
pressure gradient across the hydrogen permeable membrane, the membrane thickness, the
membrane material, and by adjusting the cell voltage. In an embodiment, means to adjust the
cell voltage in addition to controlling the permeation rate comprise controlling the discharge
and optionally charge parameters such as load and applied voltage and current characteristics
and parameters wherein the latter may regard an intermittent electrolysis embodiment. In an
embodiment, the cell voltage is maintained in the range of about 0.5 tol.5V or about 0.8 to
 1.2 V. The voltage range is controlled to optimize the yield of hydrogen formed during the
electrolysis phase of the intermittent electrolysis of such an embodiment.          In another
embodiment, the permeation rate is controlled by controlling the load. In an embodiment, the
permeation rate increases with decreasing resistance of the load.       In an embodiment, the
permeation rate increases with the discharge current. The permeation rate may be adjusted to
optimize the power gain from forming hydrinos relative to the power to form H 2 from H 2 0.
         In an embodiment, a protective thin-layer NiO coat is applied by annealing a Ni
electrode in an oxidizing environment such as an oxygen atmosphere. The thickness of the
coating is controlled to one that gives stability to an alkaline electrolyte while maintaining
high ionic conductivity. In an embodiment, a species is added to the electrolyte to stabilize
the electrodes such as the anode. The additive may form a more stable Ni compound such as
NiF 2 or NiSO 4. In another embodiment, the species may comprise a metal form a more stable
Ni alloy or an oxide additive such as CeO impregnated in the NiO. The wt% of cerium oxide
may be in the range of about 0.1 to 5% or 0.3 to 1%. In another embodiment, a species is
added such as V 2 0 5 to enhance the production of H 2 at the electrolysis cathode wherein the
electrolysis may be intermittent and the electrolyte may be a molten salt or aqueous.      The
                                               113

additive may be an oxide, hydroxide, or oxyhydroxide such as those of the disclosure such as
Fe 2 0 3 , or FeOOH. Other suitable exemplary additives are AlO(OH), ScO(OH), YO(OH),

Nil/ 3Cous3Mn1/ 3O(OH). The additive may at least one of enhance the power and protect the
electrode such as the anode. For example, the additive such as MgO or Fe 2 0 3 that may form
Nii-xMgxO and NiFe 20 4, respectively, may stabilize NiO of the electrode such as the anode.

may comprise nano-particles.         The dopant may be an oxygen reduction catalyst of the
disclosure. The cathode may comprise NiO that may be stabilized. A suitable method of
stabilization is encapsulation with a material such as a stable metal such as cobalt. Thus, the
oxygen reduction catalyst may comprise cobalt encapsulated NiO.                   The oxygen reduction
cathode may undergo thermal, chemical, or electrochemical conditioning such as oxidation
by chemical or thermal methods or anodization or cathodization before it serves as a cathode.

reduced wherein the former step conditions the cathode. The electrode such as the cathode
may comprise a conductive matrix or surface coating such as carbon, carbide, nitride,
carbonitride, nitrile, or boride or comprise these materials.                In an embodiment, the
electrolysis anode comprises a catalyst such as gold-palladium nanoparticles that forms a
reactive oxygen species such as HOO- or HOOH or a compound comprising oxygen such as
PdO, AgO, Ag 2 0, Ag 2 0 3 , or HgO that undergoes reduction at a higher rate than 02 during the
discharge phase when the electrode serves as the discharge cathode. The compound may
comprise an oxide of a metal that forms reversibly during charge and discharge to provide
oxygen to the non-electrolysis discharge phase of the intermittent cycle. The compound may
                                                    114

have a free energy of formation less than that of H20. The discharge reaction may be given
by Eq. (68).     The leads such as the cathode lead may be a material that is stable to the

Au or Ni. In an embodiment, the electrolyte such as a molten or aqueous electrolyte such a
molten or aqueous hydroxide or mixtures comprises added H2 0 that increases the diffusion of
oxygen ions formed at the cathode to increase the oxygen reduction rate. The cell may be
pressurized to operate at temperature near boiling and above. Hydrogen and oxygen may be
generated in situ by electrolysis. At least one of H2 0, oxygen, and hydrogen may also be
added to the cell under pressure.         The cell pressure may be in the range of about
subatmospheric to 500 atm or about 2 to 100 atm. In another embodiment, the diffusion rate
of oxygen ions formed at the cathode is increased in a molten electrolyte such as one
comprising an oxyanion such as a alkaline electrolyte such as one comprising a hydroxide by
using at least one other salt to comprise a mixture that facilitates the higher mobility of
oxygen ions. In an embodiment, the electrolyte comprises a mixture of metal ions and anions
such as at least one of alkali, alkaline earth, and other metal ions such as transition, inner
transition, rare earth, and Group III, IV, V, and VI metal ions. The anion comprises at least

27.2 eV that permits them to serve as a catalysts by accepting about 27.2 eV from atomic H
to form H(1/2) that may further react to form H2(1/2) and H-(1/2). Additionally, OH may
serve as a catalyst since the potential energy of OH is 40.9 eV. OH may be formed from OH

wherein at least one of H2 0, OH, 02, nH, and nO (n = integer) may serve as the catalyst.
Hydrogen may be generated at the cathode by reduction of H+ wherein some of the hydrogen
reacts with the catalyst to form hydrinos. Alternatively, excess hydrogen may be supplied to
the cathode such that it reacts with the catalyst to form hydrinos. In an embodiment, at least
one of the temperature, 02 pressure, H 2 0 pressure, H2 pressure, and H+ concentration are
controlled to favor the catalyst-forming half-cell reaction and the counter reaction that results
in the optimal formation of hydrinos.        In an embodiment, the cathode half-cell potential
relative to the SHE at 25 'C is about 1.23V within about ± 0.5V. In an embodiment, the
anode half-cell potential relative to the SHE is about OV within about ± 0.5V.           Suitable
exemplary half-cell reactions are given by Eqs. (121) and (122), respectively. The overall
reaction to form hydrinos may be given by Eq. (123). Suitable exemplary cells are [Pt/C +
H 2/Nafion/Pt/C + air + H source such as H2 or a hydride or other H storage material of the
disclosure] and [Pt/C + H 2 /H 2 SO 4 /Pt/C + air + H source such as H 2 or a hydride or other H
storage material of the disclosure] a separator such as Nafion may be used with an acidic
electrolyte such as aqueous H 2 SO 4 . The hydrogen source may be the intermittent electrolysis
of the electrolysis comprising a source of H such as H 2 0.
                                                 116

        The cell comprising a proton conducting or acidic molten or acidic aqueous
electrolyte to maintain the reaction given by Eq. (123) may comprise an intermittent or
pulsed electrolysis cell. Reactions such as those given by Eqs. (121) and (122) may occur
reversibly on the corresponding electrode or on the corresponding counter electrode
following gas crossover.
        In an embodiment, the electrolyte may comprise an acidic aqueous solution.             The
charging phase of the intermittent or pulsed cycle may comprise the electrolysis of H 2 0 to H 2
and 02. The electrolysis cathode and anode reactions may comprise the reverse of Eqs. (122)
and (121), respectively, except that the hydrino formation is irreversible.          The cathode
discharge half-cell reaction may comprise the reduction of at least one of oxygen, H+, and
H20. The reduction may be given by Eq. (121). The cathode products during discharge may
be H and H20. The H2 0 may serve as a catalyst to form hydrinos. The overpotential for the
reduction reaction may cause the half-cell voltage to be about 1.23 V relative to the SHE and
25 'C. The anode discharge half-cell reaction may comprise the oxidation of H2 to form H+
(Eq. (122)).   In an embodiment, the reduction potential for the oxidation of H2 to H+ in
aqueous acidic solution (Eq. (122)) is about 0 V relative to the SHE and 25 'C.                The
overpotential for oxidation on the electrode is about OV such that the oxidation half-cell
reaction occurs at about 0 V.
        In other embodiments, the catalyst may comprise a species that accepts m27.2 eV
from atomic hydrogen such as those of the disclosure wherein the catalyst may be a half-cell
species or formed during the electrolysis or discharge phases. Hydrinos are formed during at
least one of the charge and discharge phases. Regarding the discharge phase, the half-cell
potential of the reduction reaction may be about 1.23 V or be in the range of about 0.6 to 1.4
V relative to the SHE and 25 'C, and the half-cell potential of the oxidation reaction may be
about 0 V or be in the range of about -0.5 to +0.5V relative to the SHE. The cell potential
between the electrolysis cathode and anode during the electrolysis-off or discharge phase may
be about 1.2 V or be in the range of about 0.3 to 2 V relative to the SHE and 25 'C.             In
embodiments      having an elevated temperature,       these room temperature ranges            are
thermodynamically corrected for the operating temperature.
        H+ and 02 may be formed at the anode and hydrogen at cathode during electrolysis.
During the electrolysis-off or discharge phase, H2 may be oxidized to H+ (Eq. (122) at the
electrolysis cathode, and H+ and 02 may undergo reduction at the electrolysis anode to form
H and H2 0 (Eq. (121)) wherein the latter may serve as a catalyst to form hydrinos at the
electrolysis anode.    Thus, the cell may maintain a constant polarity during charge and
discharge with the polarity of the current reversing during each phase of the cycle.           The
output may be power or waveform conditioned. In another embodiment, the reaction given
by Eq. (122) occurs reversibly at both electrodes except that the hydrino product is
irreversible. Exemplary cells are [PtTi/H 2SO 4 or H 3PO 4 (aq)/Pt, intermittent electrolysis] and
                                              117

[Pb/H 2SO 4 (aq)/Pb or PbO intermittent electrolysis].     The acid may be in any desired
concentration such as about 0.1 M to saturated. Exemplary concentrations are 14.7 M H3 PO4
and 5M H 2 SO 4 .
        In another embodiment, the gases may crossover from at least one of the anode to
cathode, and vice versa. Then, during discharge at least one of the half-cell reactions may be
switched such the 02 (Eq. (121) reduction occurs at the electrolysis cathode and H2 oxidation
(Eq. (122) occurs at the electrolysis anode. Then, the current polarity remains constant, but
the voltage polarity of the electrodes switches with the phase of the cycle. The electrode
spacing may be minimized to facilitate the gas crossover. The electrodes may be separated
by a membrane such as a proton-exchange membrane such as a Nafion membrane.                The
circuit between the electrodes may comprise a diode to maintain the constant polarity of the
current. In embodiments, the power from forming hydrinos manifests as at least one of
excess electrical and thermal power over the dissipated electrolysis power.
        In an embodiment of an aqueous intermittent electrolysis cell, H+ and oxygen may be
formed at the electrolysis anode, and OH- and H2 may be formed at the electrolysis cathode

         In an embodiment of a molten electrolyte, the cell temperature is maintained at least
the melting point of the electrolyte and higher. The electrolyte may be a molten hydroxide
that may be a mixture with at least one other compound such as a salt such as a halide salt.
Exemplary suitable hydroxide mixture electrolytes are LiOH-LiBr, LiOH-LiX, LiOH-NaOH,

of H 2 0, 02, and H 2 can be controlled to adjust the half-cell voltage to control the rate of the
hydrino reaction.     In an embodiment, comprising a hydrogen permeable membrane, the
temperature of the cell is maintained at an elevated temperature that achieves a desired
permeation rate. The membrane material, thickness, and hydrogen pressure are also selected
to achieve the desired permeation rate. In an embodiment, the cell temperature is in the range
of about 25 to 2000 'C, 100 to 1000 'C, 200 to 750 'C, or 250 to 500 'C.                If the cell
comprises a permeation membrane and a molten salt electrolyte, the cell temperature is
maintained above the melting point of the electrolyte and at the level that achieves the desired
permeation rate. Thus, in an embodiment, the cell temperature is maintained at least the
melting point of the salt and higher. The temperature above the melting point may be in the

to 1 X 10-8 mole s-1 cm-2. The cell temperature of an intermittent electrolysis cell or a cell
comprising a hydrogen sparging or bubbling electrode is maintained above the melting point
of the electrolyte.    In an exemplary cell comprising the electrolyte LiOH-LiBr having a
eutectic mixture of about (43%-57%) such as the cell [Ni/LiOH-LiBr/Ni + air; intermittent
electrolysis] or [Ni(H 2)/LiOH-LiBr/Ni + air] wherein the hydrogen electrode (designated
Ni(H 2)) comprises an H2 sparging or bubbling electrode, the eutectic electrolyte melting point
is about 265 'C. The cell may be maintained at this temperature and above. The hydrogen
flow rate per geometric area of the H2 bubbling or sparging electrode may be in the range of
about 1 X 10-" mole s-1 cm-2 to 1 X 10-4 mole s-1 cm-2, I X 10-1 mole s-1 cm-2 to I X 10-5
mole s-1 cm-2 , 1 X 10-11 mole s-1 cm-2 to 1 X 10-6 mole s-1 cm- 2 , 1 X 10-1 mole s-1 cm-2 to 1 X
 10-7 mole s-1 cm-2, or 1 X 10-9 mole s-1 cm-2 to 1 X 10-8 mole s-1 cm-2. In an embodiment, the
rate of reaction at the counter electrode matches or exceeds that at the electrode at which
hydrogen reacts.     In an embodiment, the reduction rate of at least one of H 2 0 and 02 is
sufficient to maintain the reaction rate of H or H2. The counter electrode has a surface area
and a material sufficient to support the sufficient rate.
         The electrodes and electrolyte system may be in a vessel closed to atmosphere. In the
case of intermittent electrolytic cell comprising a molten hydroxide salt electrolyte, the water
partial pressure supplied to the cell may be controlled to favor the OH- producing reaction
over other 02 and H2 0 reduction reactions such as those that form at least one of peroxide,
superoxide, and oxide. In an embodiment, at least one of the temperature, 02 pressure, H2 0
pressure, H2 pressure, and OH- concentration are controlled to favor the catalyst-forming
                                                121

half-cell reaction and the counter reaction that results in the optimal formation of hydrinos.
One or more of the corresponding reactions may be given by Eqs. (90-93). The cell may be
closed to air.    In an embodiment, the oxygen of at least one half-cell reaction is from
electrolysis such as oxidation of at least one of H2 0 and OH-. Suitable exemplary cells that
undergo intermittent or pulsed electrolysis are [Ni(H 2)/LiOH-LiBr/Ni], [Ni(H 2)/NaOH
NaBr/Ni], [Ni(H 2)/NaOH-NaI/Ni], [Ni(H 2)/Sr(OH) 2/Ni], and similar cells of the disclosure
wherein some H2 0 is present and intermittent electrolysis may be the source of hydrogen in
replacement of or in addition to H permeation.       H2 0 may be added back to replace any
consumed to form hydrinos. Excess oxygen may also be removed. The water vapor pressure
may be controlled by a generator connected to the cell. The H2 0 vapor generator may have a
temperature lower than that of the cell temperature to control the H2 0 vapor pressure. In an
embodiment, the water vapor generator may comprise an atomizer or nebulizer such as an
ultrasonic one. The H 2 0 vapor may be delivered by a flow such as that of an inert gas such
as a noble gas or N 2. The flow may comprise a carrier gas. The H2 0 may be delivered by
entrainment in the carrier gas. The carrier gas may be bubbled through a H2 0 column to
cause the carrier gas to contain H2 0 vapor. The carrier gas composition, the H2 0 column
height, the column temperature, the gas pressure, the gas entrance size, the presence of a
diffuser and the number and size of any orifices are adjusted to achieve the desired degree of
saturation of the carrier gas with H 2 0 and the H2 0 flow rate into the cell. The gas may be
recirculated. Alternatively, the H2 0 mass balance may be controlled to achieve the desired
H2 0 wt% of the electrolyte or half-cell reactants. In an embodiment, loss of electrolyte by
means such as volatilization of hydroxides such a LiOH can be decreased by lowering the
cell temperature, maintaining an elevated cell pressure, and running the cell at least partially
closed wherein the gases may be supplied by intermittent electrolysis and by lines with
selective directional flow. The water vapor generator or water mass balance may also control
at least one of the water content and pressure of a closed intermittent electrolytic cell having
an acidic electrolyte. Exemplary reactions involving H2 0 are given by Eqs. (121-123).
         In an embodiment, the source of H2 0 to the cell may be the dehydration of the
electrolyte such as a hydroxide. An exemplary reaction of an alkali hydroxide such as LiOH
is
         2LiOH to Li 2 0 + H2 0                                                            (132)
The dehydration reaction may occur even if it is endergonic with energy supplied by at least
one of intermittent electrolysis, the hydrino formation reaction, and heat. In an embodiment
the CIHT or electrolytic cell anode comprises a material such as a metal such as Mo or a Mo
alloy such as Haynes 242, MoNi, MoCu, or MoCo that has an exergonic reaction with H2 0.
The cell source of H 2 0 may be the dehydration reaction that is endergonic in its overall
reaction with the anode. An exemplary reaction is the reaction of the LiOH electrolyte with
Mo to form Mo oxide, Li 2 0, and hydrogen. Then, the cell may be run for a suitable duration
                                               122

to form energy without significant degradation of the anode. The conditions of the cell such
 as the operating temperature may be changed such that the electrolyte could be regenerated
without substantial reaction with the anode.         For example, the cell temperature could be
 lowered and H 2 0 added to the electrolyte to rehydrate it. The regenerated cell may then be
 operated further at the typical operating conditions.
         In an embodiment, the electrolyte comprises a hydroxide such as an alkali hydroxide
 such as LiOH and further comprises the dehydrated form such as the oxide as a mixture
wherein the concentration of the dehydrated form such as Li 2 0 is within a range such that the
 anode is stabilized from oxidation. In an embodiment, the anode such as a Mo anode reacts
with the hydrated form such as LiOH and is stable in the presence of the dehydrated form
 such as Li 2 0. The concentration range of the two forms is such that the oxidation potential
provides stability to the anode to oxidation. The concentration range further provides that
 excess energy is formed during the operation of the cell wherein the source of H may be from
 intermittent electrolysis. In an embodiment, the electrolyte may become further dehydrated
 during operation.     The electrolyte may be rehydrated continuously or periodically or
 intermittently. In the latter case, the H 2 0 addition may occur at a lower temperature than the
 operating temperature to prevent the anode such as a Mo anode from oxidizing during
hydration.      Once rehydrated the cell may be heated and operated at a standard higher
 operating temperature. The electrolyte may further comprise a mixture of a hydroxide, the
 dehydrated form, and at least one other salt such as a halide such as an alkali halide such as
 LiBr.
         In an embodiment, the cells of the intermittent electrolytic cell are arranged in a stack.
 Each cell may comprise a molten electrolyte such as a molten hydroxide and optionally at
 least one other salt or a molten aqueous electrolyte such as an aqueous alkaline electrolyte.
 The cathode of each cell may comprise an air or oxygen electrode. In embodiments, the
 source of oxygen of the cell is at least one of air, external oxygen, and electrolytically
 generated oxygen. In an embodiment, the cathode may comprise at least a portion that is
 exposed to a source of oxygen such as air or 02 gas. The exposed portion may extend out
 from the cell stack and electrolyte to allow 02 or reduced 02 to flow into the electrolyte at the
 cathode-electrolyte interface.     In another embodiment, the cell may be closed and the
hydrogen and oxygen may be generated electrolytically. The system may comprise a heater
to maintain the stack at a desired elevated temperature. The temperature may be at about or
 greater then the melting point of the molten electrolyte.          In an embodiment, the cell
 comprises a jelly-roll or Swiss role design. In an embodiment, a separator or spacer and
 electrolyte are applied between electrodes that may comprise sheets that are rolled up. The
jelly-roll or Swiss role cell may be closed. The cell may be rolled tightly with the oxygen
provided by electrolysis.      In an embodiment, the oxygen reduction electrode such as the
 cathode may be fully submerged in the electrolyte. The intermittent electrolysis electrodes
                                                 123

that supply the hydrogen and oxygen may be different materials such as different metals or
different materials of the disclosure such different electrodes selected from the group of
metals, carbon, carbides, borides, nitrides, and carbonitrile. The cathode material may absorb
oxygen during electrolysis and release it during the discharge phase of the intermittent cycle.
        In an embodiment, the voltage of the half-cell reaction to form the catalyst relative to
25'C and the SHE is about 1.2V. Suitable voltages are in the ranges of about 1.5V to 0.75V,

that form H 20 such as those given by Eqs. (90) and (121).         In an embodiment, the cell
theoretical voltage is about 0 V. The cell reactions may comprise water reduction to OH- and
H2 at the cathode and the reaction of OH- and 1/2H 2 to H 2 0 at the anode. In an embodiment,

having a having a theoretical cell voltage of about greater than 0 V.          In an exemplary
embodiment, cell reactions may comprise water reduction to OH- and H 2 at the cathode and
the reaction of OH- and 1/2H 2 to H2 0 at the anode having a theoretical cell voltage of about 0
V, and also a net cell reaction to form water (Eq. (93)) having a theoretical cell voltage is
greater that OV.

containing a H2 getter 673 wherein un-reacted H2 from the anode source and H2 formed at the
cathode may be collected by the H 2 getter. The H2 having water at least partially removed by
the H 2 0 collection system flows from the first chamber to the second through gas passage
                                              125

675. In an embodiment, a H2 selective membrane exists between the chambers to prevent
H2 0 from entering the second chamber and reacting with the getter. The getter may comprise
a transition metal, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, inner transition metal, rare earth metal,
combinations of metals, alloys, and hydrogen storage materials such as those of the
disclosure. The collected H2 may be returned to the CIHT cell through a passage 676 assisted
by pump 678 or by the pressure created by heating the getter or collected H2 with heater 680.
The flow of H2 and the pressure may be controlled in the chamber by valves 681 and 682,
monitored by a gauge 684. The getter may collect hydrogen with the value 681 open and
valve 682 closed to the cell wherein the heater maintains it at one temperature suitable for
reabsorbing H2. Then, the value 681 may be closed and the temperature increased to a
temperature that causes the hydrogen to be release to a desired pressure measured with gauge
684. Valve 682 may be opened to allow the pressurized hydrogen to flow to the cell. The
flow may be to the anode 653 comprising a H2 permeable wall. Valve 682 may be closed, the
heater 680 reduced in temperature, and the valve 681 opened to collect H2 with the getter 673
in a repeated cycle. In an embodiment, the power to the heater, valves, and gauges may be
provided by the CIHT cell.       In an embodiment, the temperature difference between the
collection systems and cells may be used to achieve the desired pressures when introducing
H 2 or H 2 0 into the cell. For example, H 2 may be at a first temperature and pressure in a
sealed chamber that is immersed in the hot salt to achieve a second higher pressure at the
higher salt temperature. In an embodiment, the CIHT cell comprises a plurality of hydrogen
permeable anodes that may be supplied hydrogen through a common gas manifold.
         In another embodiment of the system shown in FIGURE 5, an 02 source is supplied at
the cathode 652 such as at least one of air, 02, oxide, H20, HOOH, hydroxide, and
oxyhydroxide. The source of oxygen may also be supplied to the cell through selective valve
or membrane 646 that may be a plurality wherein the membrane is 02 permeable such as a
Teflon membrane. Then, system 657 comprises a separator of H2 and other cell gases such as
at least one of nitrogen, water vapor, and oxygen wherein system 671 collects the unused
hydrogen and returns it to the cell such as through the H2 permeable anode 653. The system
657 may condense water. System 667 may in addition or optionally comprise a selective H2
permeable membrane and valve 668 that may be at the outlet of system 657 that retains 02,
N 2, and possibly water and permits H 2 to selectively pass to system 671. In an embodiment,
the vapor pressure of water is controlled at one or more of the cathode 651 and the cell to
control the cell power output.
         In an embodiment, the H2 permeable electrode is replaced with a H2 bubbling anode
653. H2 may be recycled without removing H2 0 using at least one pump such as 678. If
oxygen is supplied to the cell such as through selective valve or membrane 646 or at the 02
porous cathode 652, then it may be removed from the H2 by system 657. An exemplary
porous electrode to supply at least one of H2, H 20, air, and 02 by sparging comprises a tightly
                                                126

bound assembly of a Ni porous body (Celmet #6, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd.) within
an outer alumina tube. If air is supplied to the cell than N 2 is optionally removed from the re
circulated H2 gas.         Any H 2 consumed to form hydrinos or lost from the system may be
replaced.      The H2 may be replaced from the electrolysis of H 20.              The power for the
electrolysis may be from the CIHT cell.
         The hydrogen permeation rate or flow rate for the permeation and bubbling anodes,
respectively, is controlled to optimize the power gain due to the hydrino reaction relative to
the conventional reaction of hydrogen and oxygen form to water. Considering the active
surface area such as that defined by the physical dimensions of the external surface exposed
to the electrolyte, suitable flow rates are in the ranges of about 10-1 to 10-2 moles cm-2 s-1,
about 10-11 to 10-6 moles cm- 2 s-1, about 10-10 to 10-7 moles cm-2 s-1, and about 10-9 to 10-8
moles Cm s . The cathode reduction rate of at least one of 02, H20, and mixtures of 02 and
H2 0 such as in air may be any desirable rate to maintain the cell reaction of a given hydrogen
permeation or flow rate at the anode. Suitable reduction rates expressed as a current per
effective surface are in the ranges of about 0.001 to 1000 mA cm-2, about 0.1 to 100 mA cm-2,
                                  -2
and about 0.5 to 10 mA cm . In an embodiment, the cathode gas may comprise a mixture of
02,  H20, and N 2. The mole fractions may be any desired. Suitable mole fractions are about
those of air (02 - 2 0 % , N2 -80, H2 0 -0.5- 3 %), but any given component may be changed by
to be in the range of about 0.1 to 99 mole %. In other embodiments, the 0 2/N2/ H2 0 mole %s
are in the range of about 1 to 99%, 1 to 99%, and 0.0001 to 99%, respectively, the total
comprising about 100%. Other gases such as Ar of air may be present as well.                         In an
embodiment, CO 2 is scrubbed from the gas entering the cell.
         In an embodiment, at least one of nH, 0, nO, OH, and H2 0 (n = integer) may serve as
the catalyst. H may react with a source of oxygen to form at least one of OH and H20. The

         An acid-base reaction is another approach to H2 0 catalyst.           Thus, the thermal

about ambient to 1500 'C.     The pressure range may be any desired such as in the range of
about 0.01 Torr to 500 atm. The reactions are at least one of regenerative an reversible by the
methods disclosed herein and in my prior US Patent Applications such as Hydrogen Catalyst
Reactor, PCT/US08/61455, filed PCT 4/24/2008; Heterogeneous Hydrogen Catalyst Reactor,

Catalyst Power System, PCT/US12/31369 filed 3/30/2012; herein incorporated by reference
in their entirety.  Reactions that form H2 0 may be reversible by changing the reaction
conditions such as temperature and pressure to allow the reverse reaction that consumes H2 0
to occur as known by those skilled in the art. For example, the H2 0 pressure may be
increased in the backward reaction to reform the reactants from the products by rehydration.
In other cases, the hydrogen-reduced product may be regenerated by oxidation such as by
reaction with at least one of oxygen and H2 0. In an embodiment, a reverse reaction product
may be removed from the reaction such that the reverse or regeneration reaction proceeds.
The reverse reaction may become favorable even in the absence of being favorable based on
equilibrium thermodynamics by removing at least one reverse reaction product.             In an
exemplary embodiment, the regenerated reactant (reverse or regeneration reaction product)
comprises a hydroxide such as an alkali hydroxide.       The hydroxide may be removed by
methods such as solvation or sublimation.       In the latter case, alkali hydroxide sublime
unchanged at a temperature in the range of about 350-400 'C.           The reactions may be
maintained in the power plants systems of my prior US Patent Applications. Thermal energy

from a cell producing power may provide heat to at least one other cell undergoing
regeneration as disclosed previously. Alternatively, the equilibrium of the reactions to form
H2 0 catalyst and the reverse regeneration reaction can be shifted by changing the temperature
of the water wall of the system design having a temperature gradient due to coolant at
selected region of the cell as previously disclosed.
        In an embodiment, the regeneration reaction of a hydroxide and halide compound
mixture such as Cu(OH) 2 + CuBr 2 may by addition of at least one H2 and H 2 0. Products
such as Halides and oxides may be separated by sublimation of the halide.                  In an
embodiment, H2 0 may be added to the reaction mixture under heating conditions to cause the
hydroxde and halde such as CuBr 2 and Cu(OH) 2 to form from the reaction products. In an
embodiment, the regeneration may be achieved by the step of thermal cycling.                In an
embodiment, the halide such as CuBr 2 is H 2 0 soluble whereas the hydroxide such as
Cu(OH) 2 is insoluble.      The regenerated compounds may be separated by filtering or
precipitation. The chemicals may be dried with wherein the thermal energy may be from the
reaction. Heat may be recuperated from the driven off water vapor. The recuperation may be
by a heat exchanger or by using the steam directly for heating or to generate electricity using
a turbine and generator for example.     In an embodiment, the regeneration of Cu(OH) 2 from
CuO is achieved by using a H2 0 splitting catalyst. Suitable catalysts are noble metals on a
support such as Pt/A120 3, and CuAlO 2 formed by sintering CuO and A12 0 3 , cobalt-phosphate,
cobalt borate, cobalt methyl borate, nickel borate, RuO 2, LaMnO 3, SrTiO 3, TiO 2 , and W0 3.
An exemplary method to form an H 20-splitting catalyst is the controlled electrolysis of Co 2+
and Ni 2 + solution in about 0.1 M potassium phosphate borate electrolyte, pH 9.2, at a
potential of 0.92 and 1.15 V (vs., the normal hydrogen electrode), respectively. Exemplary,

reactants and products may be maintained at one or more of about the optimum temperature
at which the free energy is about zero and about the optimum temperature at which the
reaction is reversible to obtain regeneration or steady power for at least a duration longer than

wherein n is an integer and an integer and integer p > 1 may be substituted for 4. In an
embodiment, a compound comprising silicon and oxygen such as SiO 2 or quartz may serve as
a getter for H2 (1/4).  The getter for H2(1/4) may comprise a transition metal, alkali metal,
alkaline earth metal, inner transition metal, rare earth metal, combinations of metals, alloys
such as a Mo alloy such as MoCu, and hydrogen storage materials such as those of the
disclosure.
        The compounds of the present invention are preferably greater than 0.1 atomic
percent pure. More preferably, the compounds are greater than 1 atomic percent pure. Even
more preferably, the compounds are greater than 10 atomic percent pure. Most preferably,

media, fiber optic cables, magnets and magnetic computer storage media, and etching agents,
masking agents, dopants in semiconductor fabrication, fuels, explosives, and propellants.
Increased binding energy hydrogen compounds are useful in chemical synthetic processing
methods and refining methods. The increased binding energy hydrogen ion has application
as the negative ion of the electrolyte of a high voltage electrolytic cell.
        In an embodiment, hydrinos are formed by heating a source of catalyst and a source
of hydrogen such as a solid fuel of the disclosure. The heating may be at least one of thermal
heating and percussion heating. Experimentally, Raman spectroscopy confirms that hydrinos
are formed by ball milling a solid fuel such as a mixture of a hydroxide and a halide such as a
mixture comprising alkali metals such as Li. For example, an inverse Raman effect peak is
observed from ball milled LiOH + LiI and LiOH + LiF at 2308 cm-1. Thus, a suitable
                                                147

exemplary mixture is LiOH + LiI or LiF. In an embodiment, at least one of thermal and
percussion heating is achieved by an explosion. In this case, an additional energetic reaction
is provided by forming hydrinos.
        In an embodiment, H2 (1/p) may serve as a MRI paramagnetic contrast agent since the
1 quantum number is nonzero.
        The nonzeo 1 quantum number allowing the rotational selection rule of the magnitude
of AJ = +1 is permissive of a H2 (1/p) molecular laser.
        In an embodiment, since H2 (1/p) is paramagnetic, it has a higher liquefaction
temperature than H2. Bulk hydrino gas may be collected by cryo-separation methods.

intermittent electrolysis wherein hydrogen was formed at the discharge anode and oxygen at
the discharge cathode from H20.       During discharge, the reactions and the current were
reversed to form nascent H2 0 catalyst and hydrinos to give rise to excess current and energy
such that a net excess electrical energy balance was achieved. In another variant, this cell
type was operated partially open to air. Another type comprised an aqueous electrolyte such
as saturated KOH, and different cathodes and anodes that were operated under intermittent
electrolysis  conditions   open to air. The results from exemplary           cells designated
[anode/electrolyte/cathode]  such as [Ni/LiOH-LiBr-MgO/NiO (closed or air)], and [[Co

 commercial .02" thick MoCu 5/5 at.% foil (Ametek) 1.5" in diameter were welded together
using a .02" thick Ni shim having a 1" ID. The top MoCu foil had a .25" diameter hole in the
 center which a .25" OD 8" tall Ni tube was welded. Cathode: 5mm thick oxidized Ni Celmet
jelly roll 1.5" diameter and 2" tall with a .468" hole at the center. Electrolyte: 15g of LiOH
 and 75g of LiBr were weighed and placed in an alumina crucible, then heated to 430'C.
Assembly: Anode was leak checked down to 0.2 torr using the hydrogen permeation set-up.
 Following the leak check the anode was closed off to remain under vacuum while the
hydrogen supply tank was refilled with hydrogen to 998.1 torr. The anode was then filled and
the pressure recorded as 971.2 torr. The anode was then place into the electrolyte and allowed
to rest during which the pressure in the tank increased slightly to 973.1 torr. This was the
 starting value for the pressure of the cell. These three pressures and the calculated volume of
the entire assembly were/are used to generate calculations for the amount of hydrogen
 moving through the anode diaphragm.

To this point the cell had a net energy of 3.11 Wh. As a result of poor gain we added 0.5g
MoO 2 to regenerate the cell. To do so, the cell was momentarily removed from the electrolyte
bath while the MoO 2 was poured into the electrolyte. The cell assembly was then place back
into the bath and a test schedule applied 1.2V to the cell. An initial current of-300mA was
required, but asymptotically fell to 58mA over which the entire duration lasted 6 hours.
Following the MoO 2 treatment, a schedule of .2/.4s 50mA was applied. The day and voltage

B. Water-Flow, Batch Calorimetry
        The energy and power balance of the catalyst reaction mixtures listed on the right
hand side of each entry in TABLE 5 was obtained using cylindrical stainless steel reactors of
approximately 43 cm3 volume (1" inside diameter (ID), 5" length, and 0.060" wall thickness
having an internal thermocouple well) and a water flow calorimeter comprising a vacuum
chamber containing each cell and an external water coolant coil that collected 99+% of the
energy released in the cell to achieved an error < ±1% . The energy recovery was determined
by integrating the total output power P, over time. The power was given by
        P =mCAT                                                                        (254)
where th was the mass flow rate, C, was the specific heat of water, and AT was the
absolute change in temperature between the inlet and outlet. The reaction was initiated by
applying precision power to external heaters. Specially, 200 W of power was supplied to the
heater.   During this heating period, the reagents reached a hydrino reaction threshold
temperature wherein the onset of reaction was typically confirmed by a rapid rise in cell
temperature. Once the cell temperature reached about 400-500 'C the input power was set to
zero. After 18 minutes, the program directed the power to zero. To increase the rate of heat
transfer to the coolant, the chamber was re-pressurized with 1000 Torr of helium, and the
maximum change in water temperature (outlet minus inlet) was approximately 1.2 'C. The
assembly was allowed to fully reach equilibrium over a 24-hour period as confirmed by the
observation of full equilibrium in the flow thermistors.
                                               163

         In each test, the energy input and energy output were calculated by integration of the
corresponding power. The thermal energy in the coolant flow in each time increment was
calculated using Eq. (245) by multiplying volume flow rate of water by the water density at
 19 'C (0.998 kg/liter), the specific heat of water (4.181 kJ/kg C), the corrected temperature
difference, and the time interval. Values were summed over the entire experiment to obtain
the total energy output. The total energy from the cell E must equal the energy input En
and any net energy E,, . Thus, the net energy was given by
         E,,, = E, - E n.                                                                        (255)
From the energy balance, any excess heat E, was determined relative to the maximum
theoretical E., by
         E, = E,, - E,                                                                           (256)
         The calibration test results demonstrated a heat coupling of better than 98% of the
resistive input to the output coolant, and zero excess heat controls demonstrated that the with
calibration correction applied, the calorimeter was accurate to within less than 1% error. The
results are given as follows where Tmax is the maximum cell temperature, Ein is the input
energy, and dE is the measured output energy in excess of the input energy. All theoretical
energies are negative when exothermic. Positive output values represent more output than
input energy. Reactions wherein products of a prior reaction were run as indicated comprised
tests of regeneration.

  D. Spectroscopic Identification of Molecular Hydrino
           Classical physical laws predict that atomic hydrogen may undergo a catalytic reaction
  with certain species, including itself and nascent H 2 0, that can accept energy in integer
  multiples of the potential energy of atomic hydrogen, m - 27.2 eV, wherein m is an integer.
  The predicted reaction involves a resonant, nonradiative energy transfer from otherwise
  stable atomic hydrogen to the catalyst capable of accepting the energy.                     The product is
  H(1/p), fractional Rydberg states of atomic hydrogen called "hydrino atoms," wherein n =
   1/2, 1/3, 1/4,..., i/p (p<137 is an integer) replaces the well-known parameter n = integer in
  the Rydberg equation for hydrogen excited states.              Each hydrino state also comprises an
  electron, a proton, and a photon, but the field contribution from the photon increases the

Since atomic and molecular hydrinos, like the corresponding excited states have f quantum
states, unique spectral characteristics such as orbital-nuclear splitting, excited-state-type ro
vibrational selection rules, and magnetic interactions are anticipated that depart from the
characteristics of unexcited, ordinary atomic and molecular hydrogen.
         Continuum radiation in the 10 to 30 nm region that matched predicted transitions of H
to hydrino states, were observed only arising from pulsed pinched hydrogen discharges with
metal oxides that are thermodynamically favorable to undergo H reduction to form HOH
catalyst; whereas, those that are unfavorable did not show any continuum even though the
low-melting point metals tested are very favorable to forming metal ion plasmas with strong
short-wavelength continua in more powerful plasma sources [R. L. Mills, R. Booker, Y. Lu,

the catalyst gives rise to a concerted energy exchange of the total energy of 40.8 eV with the

        A system of the present invention is directed to a hydrino fuel cell called a CIHT
(Catalyst-Induced-Hydrino-Transition) cell that generates an electromotive force (EMF) from
                                               170

the catalytic reaction of hydrogen to lower energy (hydrino) states providing direct
conversion of the energy released from the hydrino reaction into electricity. Each CIHT cell
comprises a cathode compartment comprising a cathode, an anode compartment comprising
an anode, and an electrolyte that also serves as a source of reactants to form hydrinos. Due to
oxidation-reduction half cell reactions, a hydrino-producing reaction mixture is constituted
with the migration of electrons through an external circuit and ion mass transport through a
separate internal path through the electrolyte to complete an electrical circuit. In one type of
electrolytically regenerative CIHT cell, atomic hydrogen and oxygen are intermittently
formed by electrolysis of H2 0 in the cell, and the hydrogen catalyst and subsequently
hydrinos are formed by a reaction of the reaction mixture during cell discharge with a net
gain of electrical output. An exemplary CIHT comprised a nickel mat or Mo anode, nickel
oxide cathode, and the molten eutectic salt electrolyte LiOH-LiBr with MgO matrix. The cell
ran off of water supplied as vapor to the cell or extracted from air. The cell was operated
under intermittent electrolysis and discharge. Hydrogen and oxygen were generated during
the electrolysis phase at the negative and positive electrodes, respectively, and served as the
sources of H and H 2 0 catalyst.       CIHT cells were validated by six independent expert
scientists or teams to produce as high as 1000 times more electricity out than that required to
electrolyze H 2 0 as the source of hydrogen to form hydrinos. These cells and other scale-up
cells served as electrode and electrolyte samples for analytical analysis for the production of
the theoretically predicted molecular hydrino product H2(1/4).
         CIHT cells having a molten LiOH-LiBr-MgO electrolyte and a single electrode set or
a stack of CIHT cells having bipolar plate electrodes served as a source of molecular hydrino
for analytical tests such as magic angle spinning 'H              nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MAS       1H  NMR), electron-beam excitation emission spectroscopy, Raman
spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). The single-cell cathode and anode comprised NiO and Ni celmet or Mo,
respectively. The bipolar electrodes each comprised a NiO cathode attached to a separator
plate of a different metal than that of the anode. Exemplary separator plate-anode metal pairs
were 214 alloy-Ni, Ni-Mo, Hastelloy alloys-Mo, and Mo-Ni celmet. The cells were sealed in
a vacuum chamber and were closed except for the flow of H2 0 vapor entrained in argon gas
or from a H2 0 vapor generator. The electrical performance of cells comprising a stack of n
cells was similar to that of the corresponding single cell except that the cell voltage was n
times that of the single cell. The molecular hydrino samples comprised electrolyte, chemical
products, and inorganic compound getters such as KCl, KOH, and KCl-KOH mixture placed
in the sealed container of closed CIHT cells wherein hydrinos generated during operation
were trapped in the matrix of the compound that thereby served as a molecular hydrino getter.
Starting materials not exposed to a hydrino source served as controls.
                                                171

         MAS     'H   NMR, ToF-SIMS,        ESI-ToFMS,    electron-beam     excitation   emission
spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence emission spectroscopy, FTIR, and
XPS analysis were performed on samples of reaction products comprising CIHT electrolyte,
CIHT electrodes, solid fuels products, and inorganic compound getters such as KCl, KOH,
and KCl-KOH mixture placed in the sealed container of closed CIHT cells or thermal
reactors.   The characteristics of molecular hydrino match those of dark matter, and dark
matter (H 2 (1/p)) is anticipated to present in certain materials capable of entrapping it.
Consistent with expectations, KCl getter contained same naturally abundant H 2(1/4) that was
greatly increased with exposure to a source of H 2(1/4).
         MAS NMR of molecular hydrino trapped in protic matrix represents a means to
exploit the unique characteristics of molecular hydrino for its identification via its interaction
with the matrix. A unique consideration regarding the NMR spectrum is the possible
molecular hydrino quantum states. Similar to H 2 exited states, molecular hydrinos H 2 ( / p)
have states with f    = 0,1,2,..., p -1. Even the f =  0 quantum state has a relatively large
quadrupole moment, and additionally, the corresponding orbital angular momentum of f # 0
states gives rise to a magnetic moment [Mills GUTCP] that could cause an upfield matrix
shift. This effect is especially favored when the matrix comprises an exchangeable H such as
a matrix having waters of hydration or an alkaline hydroxide solid matrix wherein a local
interaction with H 2 (1 / p) influences a larger population due to rapid exchange. CIHT cell
getters such as those comprising KOH-KCl and KCl + K wherein K reacted with H 2 0 during
the hydrino reaction to form KOH showed a shift of the MAS NMR active component of the
matrix (KOH) from +4.4 ppm to about -4 to -5 ppm after exposure to the atmosphere inside
of the sealed CIHT cell. KCl + K and other getters in solid fuels reactors also showed the
upfield shifted NMR effect. For example, the MAS NMR spectrum of the initial KOH-KCl
(1:1) getter, the same KOH-KCl (1:1) getter from the scale-up 5 W stack of 10 CIHT cells
comprising [Mo/LiOH-LiBr-MgO/NiO] that output 1029 Wh at 137% gain, and the K + KCl
getter from the solid fuel reaction of FeOOH showed that the known downfield peak of OH
matrix shifted from about +4 ppm to the upfield region of about -4 ppm. Molecular hydrino
produced by the CIHT cell and solid fuels shifted the matrix from positive to significantly
upfield.   The different f quantum numbers possible for the p = 4 state can give rise to
different upfield matrix shifts consistent with observations of multiple such peaks in the
region of -4 ppm.       The MAS NMR peak of KOH matrix upfield shifted by forming a
complex with molecular hydrino can be sharp when the upfield shifted hydroxide ion (OH-)
acts as a free rotor, consistent with prior observations.       The direct observation of the
extraordinary NMR shift of H 2(1/4) may be possible by e-beam or laser heating of the solid
getter matrix to convert it from the para to NMR active ortho form to be recorded before
essentially 100% re-conversion. MASNMR is necessary to overcome the lack of molecular
                                               172

rotation at ambient temperature [Mills GUTCP]; otherwise, field inhomogeneities could not
be averaged out, and the peak would be unobservably broadened [Mills GUTCP].
         Additional evidence supports the hydrino-based shift mechanism. The ro-vibrational
spectrum of H2(1/4) was observed by electron-beam excitation emission spectroscopy of
samples having the upfield shifted MAS NMR spectral peaks. Furthermore, positive ion
ToF-SIMS spectra showed multimer clusters of matrix compounds with di-hydrogen as part
of the structure, M:H 2 (M = KOH or K2 CO 3 ). Specifically, the positive ion spectra of prior
hydrino reaction products comprising KOH and K2 CO 3 [R. L. Mills, E. Dayalan, P. Ray, B.

characterization of novel hydride compounds," Int. J. of Hydrogen Energy, Vol. 26, No. 4,

 K* (H 2 : KOH) and K* (H 2 : K 2 CO3 )n consistent with H2(1/p) as a complex in the
structure. A typical result is that of the positive ToF-SIMS spectrum of K2CO 3 -KCl (30:70
wt%) getter from the scale-up 5 W stack of 10 CIHT cells comprising [Mo/LiOH-LiBr
MgO/NiO] that output 1029 Wh at 137% gain having the upfield shifted MAS NMR spectral
peaks.    In the assignment of peaks having nominal mass m/e = M + 2, both the high
                                                    39       41               35        37
resolution mass and the isotopic abundance of          K and   K as well as      Cl and    CI were
considered.     Similar M:H 2 clusters were observed by ESI-ToFMS.            The energy of the
interaction of H2(1/p) and the matrix compound must be greater than that of thermal energies
of about 0.025 eV at room temperature since the ToF-SIMS and ESI-ToFMS clusters were
stable, and the entire matrix was shifted in some cases in the MAS NMR. A high activation
barrier to rotation is expected from this strong interaction with the matrix. Samples having
upfield MAS NMR shifts also showed Raman matrix shifts of about 0.05-0.075 eV (400-600
cm-1) for a linear series of Stokes peaks wherein the slope between peaks matched H2(1/4)
rotational transitions of 0.241 eV energy difference to a high correlation of about 0.999 or
better.
         The direct identification of molecular hydrino by its characteristic extraordinarily high
ro-vibrational energies was sought using electron-beam excitation emission spectroscopy and
Raman spectroscopy.       Another distinguishing characteristic is that the selection rules for
molecular hydrino are different from those of ordinary molecular hydrogen. H 2 excited state
lifetimes are very short, and ro-vibrational transitions having AJ =0, 1 occur during rapid
electronic transitions in H 2. But, it is not possible for H 2 to undergo a pure ro-vibrational
transition having the selection rule AJ = ±1 since f = 0 and Af = ±1 is required in order to
conserve angular momentum during the transition. In contrast, such transitions are allowed
for molecular hydrinos. The quantum numbers of the atomic electron are p , f , m,, and m,
[Mills GUTCP]. In the case of a hydrino state, the principal quantum number of excited
                                                173

                                1
states is replaced by n =      -.  Similarly to H2 excited states, molecular hydrinos have states
                               p
with      f = 0,1, 2,..., p -1    wherein    the   prolate    spheroidal    photon    fields   of
 H 2 (1/p); p = 1, 2, 3,...,137 have spherical harmonic angular components of quantum
number f relative to the semimajor axis [Mills GUTCP]. Transitions between these prolate
spheroidal harmonic states are permissive of rotational transitions of AJ = ± 1 during a pure
vibrational transition without an electronic transition as observed for H2 excited states. The
lifetimes of the angular states are sufficiently long such that H 2(1/p) may uniquely undergo a
pure ro-vibrational transition having the selection rule AJ = ±1.
         The emitting ro-vibrational molecular hydrino state may be excited by a high-energy
electron collision or the high electric field of a laser wherein due to the rotational energy of
 p 2 (J+1)0.01509 eV [Mills GUTCP] excited rotational states cannot be populated as a
statistical thermodynamic population at ambient temperatures since the corresponding
thermal energy is less than 0.02 eV. Thus, the ro-vibrational state population distribution
reflects the excitation probability of the external source. Moreover, due to the thirty-five
times higher vibrational energy of p 2 0.515 eV over the rotational energy, only the first
level, v = 1, is expected to be excited by the external source. Permitted by the change in f
quantum number, the de-excitation vibrational transition v = 1-> v         = 0 with a rotational
energy up conversion (J'-J"=-1), a down conversion (J'-J"=+1), and no change
(J'-J"=0) gives rise to the P, R, and            Q branches, respectively.   The Q-branch peak
corresponding to the pure vibrational transition v     =1 -  v =0;  AJ=0 is predicted to be the
most intense with a rapid decrease in intensity for the P and R series of transition peaks of
higher order wherein due to the available energy of internal conversion, more peaks of higher
intensity are expected for the P branch relative to the R branch. An influence of the matrix is
expected to cause a vibrational energy shift from that of a free vibrator, and a matrix
rotational energy barrier is anticipated to give rise to about the same energy shift to each of
the P and R branch peaks manifest as a nonzero intercept of the linear energy separation of
the series of rotational peaks.
         Ro-vibrational emission of H 2 (1/ 4) trapped in the crystalline lattice of getters was
excited by an incident 6 KeV electron gun with a beam current of 10-20 pA in the pressure
range of 5 X 10-6 Torr, and recorded by windowless UV spectroscopy. An example of the
resolved ro-vibrational spectrum of H2(1/4) (so called 260 nm band) in the UV transparent
matrix KCl that served as a getter in a 5 W CIHT cell stack shows the peak maximum at 258
nm with representative positions of the peaks at 222.7, 233.9, 245.4, 258.0, 272.2, and 287.6
nm, having an equal spacing of 0.2491 eV. The vibrational energy of diatomic molecules
such as H2(1/p) is given by        -  wherein k is the force constant and p is the reduced mass
                                   p
                                                 174

that is  -  for H2 (1/p). In the case that the molecule is in a crystalline lattice of infinite mass
         2
relative to H, the reduced mass for the vibration of a given H with the other treated as an
infinite mass corresponds to a reduced mass of one giving a shift of the vibrational energy by
               1
a factor of      . The local thermal equilibrium between the phonons of the matrix lattice and
the ro-vibrationally excited molecule is anticipated to result in a cutoff to the energy of the
corresponding series of lines at the matrix-shifted vibrational energy with the rotational
energy expected to be that of the corresponding free rotor which is the case with H 2 in silicon
matrix.    Given that the vibrational and rotational energies of H 2(1/p) are p 2 that of H 2 ,
 p 2 0.515 eV and p 20.01509 eV [Mills GUTCP], respectively, the ro-vibrational and
rotational energies of H2(1/4) in a crystalline lattice are predicted to have a cutoff of 5.8 eV
and an energy spacing of 0.24 eV, respectively. In general, the plot of the energy versus peak
number yields a line given by y = -0.249 eV + 5.8 eV at R = 0.999 or better in very good
agreement with the predicted values for H 2(1/4) for the transitions v = 1 -> v      =  0 and Q(0),
R(0), R(1), R(2), P(1), P(2), P(3), and P(4) wherein Q(0) is identifiable as the most intense
peak of the series.      Furthermore, the broadening of ro-vibrational transitions of H 2(1/4)
relative to ordinary H2 in a crystalline lattice is expected since the energies involved are
extraordinary, being sixteen times higher, and significantly couple to phonon bands of the
lattice resulting in resonance broadening.
         Another example is the intense 260 nm band comprising the peaks Q(0), R(0), R(1),
R(2), P(1), P(2), P(3), and P(4) observed from the KCl getter from a sealed reactor of the gun
powder reaction, KNO 3 with softwood charcoal having the formulation C 7H4 0. The 260 nm,
e-beam band has no structure other than the broad peaks at 1.4 A resolution when observed
using a Jobin Yvon Horiba 1250 M spectrometer. Additionally, structure was found to be
absent at an enhanced 0.25 A resolution as well as at 1.65 cm-1 resolution in the
photoluminescence spectra eliminating the possibility of the series comprising unresolved ro
vibrational bands of a common molecule. Different getter matrices such as KCl versus KOH
caused a discernible difference in the shift of the position of the center of the series about the
Q(0) peak further eliminating the possibility of assignment of the 260 nm band to a series of
common gaseous molecular ro-vibrational bands. Rather, the results support broad rotational
emission of H2(1/4) within the v = 1 -> v = 0 transition as the source. Specifically, the slope
matches the predicted rotational energy spacing of 0.249 eV (p = 4). The high energetics of
the hydrino reaction (200 times conventional chemistry) is possibly a small contributor to the
performance of energetic materials such as gun powder based on the observation of H 2(1/4)
product since the gun powder reaction is accepted to be well characterized.
          The e-beam excitation emission spectrum from KOH getter sealed in the vacuum
chamber containing a 65 mW, eight-layer CIHT stack, each cell comprising [Mo/LiBr-LiOH
MgO/NiO], showed a broad continuum emission feature that matched the outline of the
                                                175

profile of the 260 nm band assigned to H2(1/4) ro-vibration with a maximum intensity of
6000 counts at about 260 nm. The band that was not observed in the getter starting material
was about ten times more intense than typically observed. Intense peaks corresponding to the
260 nm, e-beam band comprising P(1) - P(6) were resolved by Raman spectroscopy.
Moreover, the energies and slight barrier to rotation for the corresponding pure rotational
series were also confirmed by Raman spectroscopy.
         Specifically, H2(1/4) was also sought using Raman spectroscopy wherein due to the
large energy difference between ortho and para, the latter was expected to dominate the
population. Given that para is even, the typical selection rule for pure rotational transitions is
 AJ = ±2 for even integers. However, orbital-rotational angular momentum coupling gives
rise to a change in the f quantum number with the conservation of the angular momentum of
the photon that excites the rotational level wherein the resonant photon energy is shifted in
frequency by the orbital-nuclear hyperfine energy relative to the transition in the absence of
the f quantum number change.          Moreover, fort # 0, the nuclei are aligned along the
internuclear axis as given in Chp 12 of Mills GUT. The rotational selection rule for Stokes
spectra defined as initial state minus final state is AJ =       - J"= -1,   the orbital angular
momentum selection rule is At = 1, and the transition becomes allowed by the conservation
of angular momentum during the coupling of the rotational and the orbital angular
momentum excitations [Mills GUT].           And, no intensity dependency on nuclear spin is
expected. Using a Thermo Scientific DXR SmartRaman with a 532 nm laser in the macro
mode, a new sharp Raman peak was observed for the K + KCl getter of the FeOOH + H 2
solid fuel at 1950 cm-1 that matching the free space rotational energy of H2(1/4) (0.2414 eV)
to four significant figures. This result shows that H2(1/4) is a free rotor which is the case
with H 2 in silicon matrix.
        Using a Thermo Scientific DXR SmartRaman with a 780 nm diode laser in the macro
mode, a 40 cm-I broad absorption peak was observed on MoCu hydrogen permeation anodes
after the production of excess electricity. The peak was not observed in the virgin alloy, and
the peak intensity increased with increasing excess energy. Moreover it was present pre and
post sonication indicating that the only possible elements to consider as the source were Mo,
Cu, H, and 0 as confirmed by SEM-EDS. Permutations of control compounds did not
reproduce the peak.       KOH-KCl gettered the gas form these cell gave a very intense
photoluminescence series of peaks that were assigned to H2(1/4) ro-vibration. Since no other
element or compound is known that can absorb a 40 cm-1 line at 1.33 eV (the energy of the
780 nm laser minus 2000 cm-1) H2(1/4) was considered. The absorption peak starting at 1950
cm-1 matched the free space rotational energy of H2(1/4) (0.2414 eV) to four significant
figures. The absorption was assigned to an inverse Raman effect for the H2(1/4) rotational
energy [Mills GUTCP] for the J'= 0 to J" = 1 transition. This result shows that H2(1/4) is a
free rotor which is the case with H2 in silicon matrix.
                                                176

         Since the H 2(1/4) pure rotational transition was also predicted to be FTIR active, the
spectrum of K + KCl getter of the FeOOH + H 2 solid fuel was recorded with a Nicolet 730
FTIR spectrometer with DTGS detector at resolution of 4 cm-'. The peak corresponding to
P(1) was absent in the starting material but was observed as a strong sharp peak at 1947 cm-1
in the FTIR spectrum. Metaborate has a peak in this region, but the            10B peak is absent.
Moreover, the Raman spectrum of a metaborate-doped KBr crystal purchased from IC Labs
showed no peak in the1950 cm-1 region.
         In addition to molten electrolytic cells, the possibility exists to generate H2 0 catalyst
in aqueous alkaline or carbonate electrolytic cells wherein H is produced on the cathode.
Electrode crossover of H formed at the cathode by the reduction of H2 0 to OH- + H can give
rise to the reaction of Eq. (54). Alternatively, there are several reactions involving carbonate
that can give rise H2 0 catalyst such as those involving a reversible internal oxidation
reduction reaction such as
         CO- + H 2 0 > C02 + 20H-                                                            (262)
as well as half-cell reactions such as
         CO,-+ 2H-> H 20+C0 2 + 2e-                                                          (263)
         CO 2 +1/     2+2e   -> CO-                                                          (264)
XPS was performed on the Ni cathode a 0.6 M K2 CO 3 electrolysis cell having Ni electrodes,
and a peak was observed at 496.4 eV that could not be assigned to any known elements. Na
being the only possibility was easy to eliminate based on the absence of any other
corresponding peaks of this element. The collisional-like Compton ionization to ordinary H
states such as H2 is expected with the ionized electron conserving the incident Al X-ray
energy as kinetic energy since H2(1/4) does not absorb or emit radiation and the ionized state
to form H2 (1 / 4) is an infinitely excited state. Given that the total energy of H 2(1/4) is 522
eV, the binding of H2 in the Ni lattice with energy comparable to the first ionization energy
of H2 would result in a peak at the observed energy [Mills GUTCP].               Depending on the
matrix and final H species other shifts in this region are possible. Peaks have been observed
on CIHT anodes as well as solid fuel products.
         Using a Thermo Scientific DXR SmartRaman with a 780 nm diode laser in the macro
mode, a 40 cm-1 broad absorption peak was observed on MoCu hydrogen permeation anodes
after the production of excess electricity. The peak was not observed in the virgin alloy, and
the peak intensity increased with increasing excess energy and laser intensity. Moreover it
was present pre and post sonication indicating that the only possible elements to consider as
the source were Mo, Cu, H, and 0 as confirmed by SEM-EDX.                  Permutations of control
compounds did not reproduce the peak. In separate experiments, KOH-KCl gettered gas
from these cells gave a very intense photoluminescence series of peaks that were assigned to
H2(1/4) ro-vibration. Since no other element or compound is known that can absorb a single
40 cm-1 (0.005 eV) near infrared line at 1.33 eV (the energy of the 780 nm laser minus 2000

cm-1 ) H 2(1/4) was considered. The absorption peak starting at 1950 cm-1 matched the free
space rotational energy of H 2(1/4) (0.2414 eV) to four significant figures, and the width of 40
cm-1 matches the orbital-nuclear coupling energy splitting [Mills GUTCP].
        The absorption peak matching the H 2(1/4) rotational energy is a real peak and cannot
be explained by any known species. The excitation of the hydrino rotation may cause the
absorption peak by two mechanisms. In the first, the Stokes light is absorbed by the lattice
due to a strong interaction of the rotating hydrino as a lattice inclusion.          This is akin to
resonance broadening observed with the 260 nm e-beam band.               The second comprises a
known inverse Raman effect.        Here, the continuum caused by the laser is absorbed and
shifted to the laser frequency wherein the continuum is strong enough to maintain the
rotational excited state population to permit the antiStokes energy contribution. Typically,
the laser power is very high for an IRE, but molecular hydrino may be a special case due to
its non-zero f quantum number and corresponding selections rules.                So, the results are
discussed from the context of the latter mechanism.
        The absorption was assigned to an inverse Raman effect (IRE) for the H 2(1/4)
rotational energy for the J'  = 1 to J"   =  0 transition. This result shows that H 2(1/4) is a free
rotor which is the case with H 2 in silicon matrix .         Moreover, since H 2 (1/4) may form
complexes with hydroxide as shown by MAS NMR and ToF-SIMs, and a matrix shift is
observed with the electron-bean excitation emission spectrum and the photoluminescence
spectrum due to the influence of the local environment at the H 2(1/4) site in the lattice, the
IRE is anticipated to shift as well in different matrices and also with pressure. Likewise, the
Raman peaks of H 2 as a matrix inclusion shift with pressure.             Several instances were
observed by Raman spectral screening of metals and inorganic compounds.                  Ti and Nb
                                                                             1
showed a small absorption peak of about 20 counts starting at 1950 cm- . Al showed a much
larger peak. Instances of inorganic compounds included LiOH and LiOH-LiBr that showed
the peak at 2308 cm-1 and 2608 cm-1, respectively. An especially strong absorption peak was
observed at 2447 cm-1 from Ca(OH) 2 that forms H 20.         The latter may serve as a catalyst to
form H 2(1/4) upon dehydration of Ca(OH) 2 at 512 'C or by reaction with CO 2 . These are
solid fuel type reactions to form hydrinos as reported previously. LiOH and Ca(OH) 2 both
showed a H 2(1/4) IRE peak, and the LiOH is commercially formed from Ca(OH) 2 by reaction
with Li 2 CO 3 . Thus, Ca(OH) 2  +  Li 2 CO 3 mixture was caused to react by ball milling, and a
very intense H 2 (1/4) IRE peak was observed centered at 1997 cm- .
        H 2(1/4) as the product of solid fuel reactions was reported previously.         The energy
released by forming hydrinos according to Eqs. (44-47) was shown to give rise to high
kinetic energy H-. Using solid fuel Li + LiNH 2 + dissociator Ru-A120       3  that can form H and
HOH catalyst by decomposition of Al(OH) 3 and reaction of Li with H 2 0 and LiNH 2, ions
arriving before m/e = 1 were observed by ToF-SIMS that confirmed the energy release of Eq.
                                                  178

(47) is manifest as high kinetic energy H-. Other ions such as oxygen (m/e = 16) showed no
early peak. The relation between time of flight T, mass m, and acceleration voltage V is
         T=A                                                                                 (265)
where A is a constant that depends on ion flight distance. From the observed ToF-SIMS
early peak at m/e = 0.968 with an acceleration voltage of 3 kV, the kinetic energy imparted to
the H species from the hydrino reaction is about 204 eV that is a match to the HOH catalyst
reaction given by Eqs. (44-47). The same early spectrum was observed in the positive mode
corresponding to H+, but the intensity was lower.
        XPS was performed on the solid fuel. The XPS of LiHBr formed by the reaction of
Li, LiBr, LiNH 2, dissociator R-Ni (comprising about 2wt% Al(OH) 3), and 1 atm H2 , shows a
peak at 494.5 eV and 495.6 eV for XPS spectra on reaction products of two different runs
that could not be assigned to any known elements.             Na, Sn, and Zn being the only
possibilities were easy to eliminate based on the absence of any other corresponding peaks of
these elements since only Li, Br, C, and 0 peaks were observed. The peak matched the
energy of the theoretically allowed double ionization of molecular hydrino H2(1/4).
Molecular hydrino was further confirmed as a product by Raman and FTIR spectroscopy.
The Raman spectrum of solid fuel product LiHBr showed a H2(1/4) inverse Raman effect
absorption peak centered at 1988 cm-1. The FTIR spectrum of solid fuel product LiHBr
showed a new sharp peak at 1987 cm-1 that is a close match to the free rotor energy of
H2(1/4).    Furthermore, the MAS NMR showed a strong up-field shift peak consistent with
prior results.
        An interrelated confirmatory observation of the identification of hydrino is that the
molecular orbital-nuclear coupling energy of H2(1/4) that is manifest as splitting of the pure
rotational Raman transitions is consistent with the spin-nuclear coupling energy predicted and
observed for the corresponding atomic hydrino H(1/4). Similar to the case with the 21 cm
(1.42 GHz) line of ordinary hydrogen, hydrino atoms were identified by its predicted 642
GHz spin-nuclear hyperfine transition observed by TeraHz absorption spectroscopy of
cryogenically cooled H2 below 35K. Using a long path length (60 m), multi-reflection
absorption cell coupled to a Fourier transform interferometer, Wishnow [E.H. Wishnow, The
Far-Infrared Absorption Spectrum of Low Temperature Hydrogen Gas, Ph.D. Thesis,
University of British Columbia, Canada, (1993).] recorded the H2 spectrum at a spectral
resolution of 0.24 cm-1 over the wavenumber, temperature, and pressure ranges of 20-320 cm
 , 21-38 K, and 1-3 atmospheres, respectively. A sharp line at 21.4 cm-1 was observed at 25.5
K, but is absent at 36 K. The wavenumber of the line is a match to the predicted 21.4 cm-1
H(1/4) hyperfine line and could not be assigned to a known species. TeraHz spectroscopy
may also serve to identify orbital-nuclear transitions of H 2(1/4).
                                               179

        Another successful cross-confirmatory technique in the search for hydrino spectra
involved the use of the by Raman spectrometer wherein the ro-vibration of H2(1/4) matching
the 260 nm e-beam band was observed as second order fluorescence.              The first sample
comprised the KOH getter from the 65 mW, eight-layer CIHT stack, each cell comprising
[Mo/LiBr-LiOH-MgO/NiO], that showed an intense (6000 count) e-beam excitation emission
of the 260 nm band profile.        Using the Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM Aramis Raman
spectrometer with a HeCd 325 nm laser in microscope mode with a magnification of 40X, an
intense series of 1000 cm-1 equal-energy spaced Raman peaks were observed at 8340, 9438,
 10,467, 11,478, 12,457, 13,433, and 14,402 cm-1 with the maximum peak intensity at 12,457
cm-1. The conversion of the Raman spectrum into the fluorescence or photoluminescence
spectrum which was then deconvolved revealed that the Raman spectrum is the superposition
of a series of evenly-spaced peaks and a continuum band emission having its maximum
intensity at green wavelengths. Green emission was observed from the sample when laser
irradiated. Green emission was further observed from the KOH getter sample during e-beam
excitation to produce the 260 nm band emission assigned to H 2(1/4) ro-vibration indicating
that the series of peaks are a separate spectral feature from the green fluorescence.       The
fluorescence spectrum in second order calculated from the Raman peak positions comprises
the peaks at 446, 469, 493, 518, 546, 577, and 611 nm. The spacing of 1000 cm-1 or 0.1234
eV matches the second order rotational spectrum of H2(1/4) very well; thus, the series of
peaks matches the second order fluorescence of the 260 nm band first observed by e-beam
excitation. In fact, considering the slight contraction at the extremes of the wavelength range
due to the matrix shift, halving the wavelength of the calculated fluorescence spectrum and
correcting to the transition between matrices results in the e-beam and Raman spectra
superimposing, including the peaks intensities.       Considering maximum peak intensity at
 12,457  cm-1 being Q(0), the assignments are Q(0), R(0), R(1), R(2), R(3), P(1), and P(2) at
 12,457, 11,478, 10,467, 9438, 8340, 13,433, and 14,402 cm-1, respectively. The excitation
was deemed to be by the high-energy UV and EUV He and Cd emission of the laser wherein
the laser optics are transparent to at least 170 nm and the grating (Labram Aramis 2400g/mm
460mm focal length system with 1024 X 26 pm 2 pixels CCD) is dispersive and has its
maximum efficiency at the shorter wavelength side of the spectral range, the same range as
the 260 nm band. For example, cadmium has a very intense line at 214.4 nm (5.8 eV) that
matches the ro-vibrational excitation energy of H2(1/4) in KCl matrix based on the e-beam
excitation data. The CCD is also most responsive at 500 nm, the region of the second order
of the 260 nm band centered at 520 nm. On a repeat scan to higher wavenumbers, additional
members of the P-branch of the ro-vibrational series were observed.
         The 260 nm band was observed in second order as fluorescence emission of
additional reaction products and getters that were shown to comprise H2(1/4) by other
analytical methods. When K2CO 3-KCl (1:1) was used as the getter for the cell [laminated

2.65 Wh discharge energy, 200% gain) the 260 nm e-beam band was observed intensely. The
Raman spectrum was recorded to 22,500 cm-1, and the corresponding laser-excited second
order fluorescence band having a slight shift due to the different matrix was observed to
extend to 17,000 cm-1. The series comprised Q(0), R(0), R(1), R(2), R(3), P(1), P(2), P(3),
P(4), and P(5) at 12,199, 11,207, 10,191, 9141, 8100, 13,183, 14,168, 15,121, 16,064, and
16,993 cm-1, respectively. The photoluminescence band was also correlated with the upfield
shifted NMR peaks. For example, the KOH-KCl (1:1) getter from the scale-up 5 W stack of
10 CIHT cells comprising [Mo/LiOH-LiBr-MgO/NiO] that output 1029 Wh at 137% gain
having upfield shifted matrix peaks at -4.06 and -4.41 ppm showed the series of
photoluminescence peaks corresponding to the 260 nm e-beam band. Q(0), R(0), R(1), R(2),
R(3), R(4), P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4), P(5), and P(6) were observed at 12,199, 11,207, 10,191,
9141, 8100, 13,183, 14,168, 15,121, 16,064, 16,993, and 17,892 cm-1, respectively. This
sample also showed intense M:H 2 (M = KOH or K2 CO 3 ) ToF-SIMS clusters. The equivalent
photoluminescence spectrum also observed from getters in solid fuels reactors such as that of
KCl + K (to form KOH in situ) getter in the reactor with solid fuel FeOOH + H2 + Ni screen
hydrogen dissociator.
        Overall, the Raman results such as the observation of the 0.241 eV (1940 cm-1)
Raman peak and the 0.2414 eV-spaced Raman photoluminescence band that matched the 260
nm e-beam spectrum is strong confirmation of molecular hydrino having an internuclear
distance that is 1/4 that of H2. The evidence in the latter case is further substantiated by being
in a region having no known first order peaks or possible assignment of matrix peaks at four
significant figure agreement with theoretical predictions.
