         Substituted anionic compounds consisting of a backbone
            consisting of a discrete number of saccharide units
[0001]     The present invention relates to anionic compounds intended for therapeutic
and/or prophylactic use, for the administration of an active ingredient or active ingredients
to humans or to animals.
[0002]     The anionic compounds according to the invention of which the backbone consists
of saccharide units comprising carboxyl groups are, owing to their structure and their
biocompatibility, undoubtedly of interest for the pharmaceutical industry, in particular for
stabilizing active ingredients, for example proteins.
[0003]     Polysaccharides and/or oligosaccharides which have properties of creating
interactions    with   active   ingredients,   for   example    proteins,   are   known    from
WO 2008/038111 and WO 2010/041119, which are patent applications filed in the name
of Adocia.
[0004]     In these patent applications, the polymers or oligomers are defined in terms of
their degree of polymerization DP, which is the average number of repeating units
(monomers) per polymer chain. It is calculated by dividing the number average molar
mass by the average mass of the repeated unit. They are also defined in terms of the chain
length distribution, also called the polydispersity index (Ip).
[0005]     These polymers are therefore compounds consisting of chains of which the
lengths are statistically variable, which are highly rich in possible sites of interaction with
protein active ingredients. This multiple-interaction potential could create a lack of
specificity in terms of interaction, whereas a smaller, better defined molecule could make
it possible to be more specific in this respect.
[0006]     Moreover, a polymer chain can interact with various sites present on a protein
ingredient, but can also, owing to the chain length, interact with several protein
ingredients, thereby leading to a bridging phenomenon. This bridging phenomenon may,
for example, result in aggregation of the proteins or in an increase in viscosity. The use of
a small molecule with a well-defined backbone makes it possible to minimize these bridging
phenomena.
[0007]     In addition, a molecule with a well-defined backbone is generally more readily
traceable (MS/MS,     for example) in biological media during pharmacokinetic or ADME
(administration, distribution, metabolism,      elimination)   experiments compared with a
polymer which generally gives a very diffuse signal with a high background noise in mass
spectrometry.
[0008]     In contrast, it is not out of the question for a well-defined and shorter molecule
to possibly exhibit a shortage of possible sites of interaction with protein active ingredients.

                                                     2
[0009]      Notwithstanding their perfectly defined structure, the anionic compounds
according to the invention consisting of a backbone made up of a discrete number u of
between 1 and 8 (1       u  8) of identical or different saccharide units also have the property
of creating interactions with active ingredients, protein active ingredients for example.
[00010] They nevertheless have particular properties with respect to certain active
ingredients which make them            candidates of choice for preparing        pharmaceutical
formulations.
[00011] The      functionalization of these anionic compounds            with  carboxyl    groups
advantageously makes it possible to modulate the interaction forces involved between the
anionic compound and the active ingredient.
[00012] By virtue of the defined structure of the backbone, the functionalization is easier
and more precise and the nature of the anionic compounds obtained is therefore more
homogeneous than when the backbone is of polymeric nature.
[00013] The present invention thus aims to provide anionic compounds intended for the
stabilization, administration and delivery of active ingredients, which can be prepared by
methods that are relatively simple to carry out. The objective of the present invention is
thus to provide anionic compounds capable of enabling the stabilization, administration
and delivery of a large diversity of active ingredients.
[00014] The invention is also directed toward the obtaining of anionic compounds which
can exhibit biodegradability that is sufficiently rapid and suitable for their use in the
preparation of a broad category of pharmaceutical formulations, including for medicaments
intended for chronic and/or high-frequency administration. In addition to the requirement
of biodegradability that can be modulated after administration, the invention aims to
provide anionic compounds which comply with the constraints established by the
pharmaceutical industry, in particular in terms of stability under normal preservation and
storage conditions, and in particular in solution.
[00015] As will be demonstrated in the examples, the substituted anionic compounds
according to the invention make it possible to prepare solutions which are nonturbid in the
presence of certain "model" proteins for formulation, such as lysozyme, which is not
possible with certain polymeric compounds, but are nevertheless capable of interacting
with model proteins such as albumin. This duality makes it possible to modulate their
properties and to obtain good excipient candidates for the formulation of protein active
ingredients without the drawbacks exhibited by some of the compounds described in the
prior art.
[00016] The present invention relates to substituted anionic compounds, in isolated form
or as a mixture, consisting of a backbone made up of a discrete number u of between 1
and 8 (1     u    8) of identical or different saccharide units, linked via identical or different
glycosidic bonds, said saccharide units being chosen from the group consisting of pentoses,

for which i = 1.25 and j = 0.39.
[000479] In one embodiment, an anionic compound according to the invention is sodium
hyaluronate tetrasaccharide functionalized with methyl phenylalaninate for which i = 0.28
and  j = 0.22.
[000480] In one embodiment, an anionic compound according to the invention is sodium
maltotriosemethylcarboxylate        functionalized   with  2-[(2-decanoylamino-6-decanoyl
amino)hexanoylamino]ethanamine for which i = 1.43 and j = 0.21.
[000481] In one embodiment, an anionic compound according to the invention is sodium
maltotriosemethylcarboxylate functionalized         with E-N-dodecanoyl-L-lysine for which

[000483] The invention also relates to the processes for producing substituted anionic
compounds, in isolated form or as a mixture, chosen from the anionic compounds
substituted with substituents of formula I or II.
[000484] In one embodiment, the substituted anionic compounds chosen from the anionic
compounds substituted with substituents of formula I or II are characterized in that they
can be obtained by random grafting of the substituents onto the saccharide backbone.
[000485] In one embodiment, the substituted anionic compounds chosen from the anionic
compounds substituted with substituents of formula I or II are characterized in that they
can be obtained by grafting the substituents at precise positions on the saccharide units
by means of a process which implements steps of protection/deprotection of the alcohol or
carboxylic acid groups naturally borne by the backbone. This strategy results in selective,
in particular regioselective, grafting of the substituents onto the backbone. The protective
groups include, without limitation, those in the textbook described PGM Wuts, et al.,
Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 2007.

                                                   47
[000486] The saccharide backbone can be obtained by degradation of a high-molecular
weight polysaccharide. The degradation routes include, without limitation, chemical
degradation and/or enzymatic degradation.
[000487] The saccharide backbone can also be obtained by formation of glycosidic bonds
between monosaccharide or oligosaccharide molecules using an enzymatic or chemical
coupling strategy. The coupling strategies include those described in the publication JT
Smooth et al., Advances in Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biochemistry 2009, 62, 162-236
and in the textbook TK Lindhorst, Essentials of Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biochemistry
2007, 157-209. The coupling reactions can be carried out in solution or on a solid support.
The saccharide molecules before coupling may bear substituents of interest and/or be
functionalized once randomly or regioselectively coupled to one another.
[000488] Thus, by way of examples, the compounds according to the invention may be
obtained according to one of the following processes:
   -       random grafting of the substituents onto a saccharide backbone;
   -       one or more steps of glycosylation between monosaccharide or oligosaccharide
           molecules bearing substituents;
   -       one or more steps of glycosylation between one or more monosaccharide or
           oligosaccharide molecules bearing substituents and one or more monosaccharide
           or oligosaccharide molecules;
   -       one or more steps of introducing protective groups onto alcohols or acids
           naturally borne by the saccharide backbone, followed by one or more substituent
           grafting reactions and, finally, a step of removing the protective groups;
   -       one or more steps of glycosylation between one or more monosaccharide or
           oligosaccharide molecules bearing protective groups on alcohols or acids
           naturally borne by the saccharide backbone, one or more steps of grafting
           substituents onto the backbone obtained, then a step of removing the protective
           groups;
   -       one or more steps of glycosylation between one or more monosaccharide or
           oligosaccharide molecules bearing protective groups on alcohols or acids
           naturally borne by the saccharide backbone, and one or more monosaccharide
           or oligosaccharide molecules, one or more substituent grafting steps, and then a
           step of removing the protective groups.
[000489] The compounds according to the invention, isolated or as a mixture, can be
separated and/or purified in different ways after they have been obtained, in particular by
means of the processes described above.
[000490] Mention may in particular be made of chromatography methods, in particular
termed "preparative", such as:
        - flash chromatography, in particular on silica, and

                                                   48
          chromatography of the HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) type, in
          particular RP-HPLH or reverse phase HPLC.
[000491] Selective precipitation methods can also be used.
[000492] The invention also relates to the use of the anionic compounds according to the
invention for preparing pharmaceutical compositions.
[000493] The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising one of the
anionic compounds according to the invention as previously described and at least one
active ingredient.
[000494] The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition characterized in that
the active ingredient is chosen from the group consisting of proteins, glycoproteins,
peptides and nonpeptide therapeutic molecules.
[000495] The term "active ingredient" is intended to mean a product in the form of a single
chemical entity and/or in the form of a combination having a physiological activity. Said
active ingredient may be exogenous, i.e. it is provided by the composition according to the
invention. It may also be endogenous, for example growth factors which will be secreted
into a wound during the first healing phase and which may be kept on said wound by the
composition according to the invention.
[000496] Depending on the pathological conditions targeted, it is intended for local and/or
systemic treatment.
[000497] In the case of local and systemic releases, the modes of administration
envisioned     are  via   the   intravenous,     subcutaneous,    intradermal,  transdermal,
intramuscular, oral, nasal, vaginal, ocular, buccal, pulmonary etc. route.
[000498] The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are either in liquid
form, in an aqueous solution, or in the form of a powder, an implant or a film. They also
comprise conventional pharmaceutical excipients well known to those skilled in the art.
[000499] Depending on the pathological conditions and the modes of administration, the
pharmaceutical compositions may advantageously also comprise excipients for formulating
them in the form of a gel, a sponge, an injectable solution, an oral solution, an orally
disintegrating tablet, etc.
[000500] The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition, characterized in that
it is administrable in the form of a stent, a film or coating of implantable biomaterials, or
an implant.

   Compound 1: Sodium maltotriosemethylcarboxylate functionalized with L
   phenylalanine
   [000502] 0.6 g (16 mmol) of sodium borohydride is added to 8 g (143 mmol of hydroxyl
   functions) of maltotriose (CarboSynth) dissolved in water at 651C. After stirring for 30 min,
 5 28 g (238 mmol) of sodium chloroacetate are added. 24 ml of 1ON NaOH (240 mmol) are
   then added dropwise to this solution and then the mixture is heated at 65*C for 90 minutes.
   16.6 g (143 mmol) of sodium chloroacetate are then added to the reaction medium, as are
   14 ml of 1ON NaOH (140 mmol), dropwise. After heating for 1 h, the mixture is diluted
   with water, neutralized with acetic acid and then purified by ultrafiltration on a 1 kDa PES
10 membrane against water. The compound concentration of the final solution is determined
   by the dry extract, and then an acid/base assay in a 50/50 (V/V) water/acetone mixture
   is carried out in order to determine the degree of substitution with methylcarboxylate.
   [000503] According to the dry extract: [compound] = 32.9 mg/g.
   [000504] According      to  the   acid/base   assay,  the    degree    of   substitution   with
15 methylcarboxylate is 1.65 per glucoside unit.
   [000505] The sodium maltotriosemethylcarboxylate solution is acidified on a Purolite
   (anionic) resin in order to obtain maltotriosemethylcarboxylic acid which is then lyophilized
   for 18 hours.
   [000506] 10 g of maltotriosemethylcarboxylic acid (63 mmol of methylcarboxylic acid
20 functions)   are solubilized in DMF and then cooled to 0*C. A mixture of ethyl
   phenylalaninate, hydrochloride salt (5.7 g; 25 mmol)         in DMF is prepared.       2.5 g of
   triethylamine (25 mmol) are added to this mixture. A solution of NMM (6.3 g; 63 mmol)
   and of EtOCOCI (6.8 g, 63 mmol) is then added to the mixture at 0*C. The ethyl
   phenylalaninate solution is then added and the mixture is stirred at 101C. An aqueous
25 imidazole solution (340 g/1) is added and the mixture is then heated to 301C. The medium
   is diluted with water and then the solution obtained is purified by ultrafiltration on a 1 kDa
   PES membrane against 0.1N NaOH, 0.9% NaCl and water. The compound concentration of
   the final solution is determined by the dry extract. A sample of solution is lyophilized and
   analyzed by 1H NMR in        D20  in order to determine the degree of substitution with
30 methylcarboxylates functionalized with phenylalanine.
   [000507] According to the dry extract: [compound 1] = 28.7 mg/g
   [000508] According to the 1H NMR: the degree of substitution with methylcarboxylates

   C. Interaction with albumin
   [000711] It is known that the prior art compounds which do not make it posisble to obtain
15 nonturbid solutions with lysozyme, interact with proteins, in particular with "model"
   proteins such as albumin.
   [000712] In order to determine, following the results obtained with the compounds
   according to the invention in the test with lysozyme (i.e. turbidity measurement assays
   previously described), whether there are nevertheless "model" proteins with which the
20 compounds according to the invention may interact, a test for interaction with albumin was
   carried out.

                                                     79
   [000713] The test carried out is a "fluorescence" test with albumin, which makes it posible,
   by measuring the variations in fluorescence of albumin, to verify whether an interaction
   exists between the compound tested and albumin.
   [000714] The     compound/albumin      solutions are   prepared  from   stock solutions of
 5 compounds and of serum albumin (BSA) by mixing the appropriate volumes in order to
   obtain a fixed BSA concentration at 0.5 mg/ml and compound/BSA weight ratios of 1, 5
   and 10. These solutions are prepared in a PBS buffer at pH 7.4.
   [000715] 200 pl of the various compound/BSA solutions are introduced into a 96-well
   plate. The fluorescence measurements are carried out at room temperature (20*C) with
10 an EnVision@ fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer). The excitation wavelength is
   280 nm and the emission wavelength is 350 nm. This corresponds to the fluorescence of
   the tryptophan residues of albumin (Ruiz-P. et al., M, A. Physico-chemical studies of
   molecular interactions between non-ionic surfactants and bovine serum albumin, Colloids
   Surf. B Biointerfaces 2009). The F (compound/BSA)/FO (BSA alone) ratio makes it possible
15 to evaluate the interaction between the compound and albumin. If this ratio is less than 1,
   this means that the compound induces partial quenching of the albumin fluorescence linked
   to a change in environment of the tryptophan residues. This change reflects an interaction
   between the compound and albumin. It was verified, as a control, that, for all the
   compounds tested, the fluorescence of the compound alone is negligible considering the
20 fluorescence of albumin (fluorescence (compound) < 2% fluorescence (albumin)). The
   results are given in table 5.
