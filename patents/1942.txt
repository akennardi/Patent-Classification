   Detailed Description
10 Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller arranged to implement a game
   where for non-winning outcomes a contribution is made
   towards an increase of a prize amount of at least one
   prize such that the player's losing outcomes result in
15 increased prizes over time. In advantageous embodiment,
   only a specific player can win the increased prizes.
   General construction of gaming system
20 The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
   a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
25 In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
30 For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
35 executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
                                             10133862_1 (GHMatters) P76328.AU.3 3/04/18

                              - 10
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
 5 wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.     For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
10 depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
15 core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
20 input/output components required for the player to enter
   instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
25 embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions          (e.g. to
30 place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
35 with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
                                             10133862_1 (GHMatters) P76328.AU.3 3/04/18

                               - 11
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:             a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
 5 or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
10 10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
15 game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
20 card.   Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
25 the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.   The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
30 module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module.

   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
                                              10133862_1 (GHMatters) P76328.AU.3 3/04/18

                              - 12
   information or images relating to the game.         Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.   A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
 5 from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.  Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
10 crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.   The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
15 type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
20
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
25 communication with the processor 102.   Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
30
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
35 machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
                                              10133862_1 (GHMatters) P76328.AU.3 3/04/18

                               - 13
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.   A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.          Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
 5 random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
10 screen and/or buttons 107   (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
15 may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
20 instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is uses to initiate a play of
   the game.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
25 communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
30 controller, central controller, server or database.                   In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and

   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.              The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.              The
 5 EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
10 or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
15 provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
20 Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
25 simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
30 One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
35 and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.

   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
 5 the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
10 gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.      A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
15 In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.   With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
20 gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
25 that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
30 incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
35 licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
                                             10133862_1 (GHMatters) P76328.AU.3 3/04/18

   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
 5 network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
10 server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.  For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
15 Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
20 terminals.
   Further detail of gaming system
   The game implemented with the gaming system can take a
25 number of different forms, for example, card games such as
   poker, spinning reel game, dice games or ball games.
   Herein the gaming system is described predominantly in
   relation to a video poker card game, however, description
   is also provided of how the gaming system can provide a
30 spinning reel game in order to provide an indication of
   how a skilled person can modify the gaming system to
   accommodate other games. Persons skilled in the art will
   appreciate that other card games can also be employed.
35 The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to place a
   wager which is deducted from the credit meter stored as
   meter data 644 in memory 64 and from which their
                                             10133862_1 (GHMatters) P76328.AU.3 3/04/18

                              - 17
   entitlement to a win or wins in the game can be
   determined. The win entitlement which will be evaluated
   for this play of the game. Placing the wager, or other
   operation of the game play mechanism 56  (such as pressing
 5 a spin or deal button in a spinning reel or card game),
   initiates a play of the game. Persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a player's win entitlement will vary
   from game to game dependent on player selections and the
   type of game.
10
   In one example of video poker, the player places a wager
   and is dealt five cards selected by the game controller of
   the gaming system from a standard 52-card pack. The wager
   can be a base amount or a multiple of the base amount,
15 accordingly the extent of the variation of the win
   entitlement is the amount wagered which controls how many
   multiple of the prize amount in the pay table the player
   is entitled to win. It will be appreciated that in some
   embodiments, only limited wager amounts or a single wager
20 amount may be available. The player has one opportunity to
   discard any number of unwanted cards, and is dealt an
   equal number of replacement cards from the deck.
   Typically, the player indicates which cards they want to
   keep by pressing a hold button associated with the cards
25 to be kept, with the other cards discarded and replaced.
   If after any re-deal, the player then has a hand which is
   in a prize table, the game controller then pays the player
   according to according to the specific hand. If the
   player's final hand is not in the pay table, the wager is
30 lost.
   The pay table includes a plurality of winning outcomes
   and may start, for example, with a pair of jacks or
   better, but the payouts may vary from game to game. The
35 top payout is typically reserved for a royal straight
   flush.
                                             10133862_1 (GHMatters) P76328.AU.3 3/04/18

                               - 18
   In spinning reel games, typical winning outcomes are
   winning combinations of symbols specified in a pay table.
   In most spinning reel games, it is typical for the
   player's entitlement to be affected not only by the amount
 5 they wager but also selections they make  (i.e. the nature
   of the wager) such that a winning outcome will often not
   only need to occur but coincide with a player selection.
   For example, a player's win entitlement may be based on
   how many lines they play in each game -  e.g. a minimum of
10 one line up to the maximum number of lines allowed by the
   game  (noting that not all permutations of win lines may be
   available for selection).  That is, a winning outcome will
   need to occur on a line played by the player for the
   player to receive the award.
15
   In many spinning reel games, the player's win entitlement
   is not strictly limited to the lines they have selected,
   for example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
   players selection of pay lines and are an inherent part of
20 the win entitlement.
   Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, the player may obtain a win entitlement by
   selecting a number of reels to play. Such games are
25 marketed under the trade name "Reel Power" by Aristocrat
   Leisure Industries Pty Ltd. The selection of the reel
   means that each displayed symbol of the reel can be
   substituted for a symbol at one or more designated display
   positions. In other words, all symbols displayed at symbol
30 display positions corresponding to   a selected reel can be
   used to form symbol combinations with symbols displayed at
   a designated, symbol display positions of the other reels.
   For example, if there are five reels and three symbol
   display positions for each reel such that the symbol
35 display positions comprise three rows of five symbol
   display positions, the symbols displayed in the centre row
   are used for non-selected reels. As a result, the total
                                             10133862_1 (GHMatters) P76328.AU.3 3/04/18

                              - 19
   number of ways to win is determined by multiplying the
   number of active display positions of each reels, the
   active display positions being all display positions of
   each selected reel and the designated display position of
 5 the non-selected reels. As a result for five reels and
   fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to win.
   In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
   shown implementing a number of modules based on program
10 code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that various of the modules could be
   implemented in some other way, for example by a dedicated
   circuit.
15 These modules include the outcome generator 622 which
   operates in response to the player's operation of game
   play mechanism 56. The player also initiate a play of the
   game and generates a game outcome for a game round of the
   game. The game outcome will then be evaluated by award
20 evaluator 623. In a video poker game, the first part of
   forming the game outcome is to select an initial five
   cards from a pack of 52 cards stored as part of game rule
   data 641. The cards are selected at random from the pack
   by outcome generator 622 using random number generator
25 621. The selected cards are advised to the display
   controller 624 which causes them to be displayed on
   display 54 so the player can see them. The player then
   operates the game play mechanism 56 to select which cards
   are to be held and which are discarded. Any discarded
30 cards are replaced by the outcome generator 622 randomly
   selecting cards from the remaining 47 cards in the deck.
   These are then displayed to the player on display 54 by
   display controller 626.
35 The outcome evaluator 623 compares the displayed cards to
   a prize table 643 to determine whether there is a winning
   outcome. If there is a winning outcome, the outcome
                                             10133862_1 (GHMatters) P76328.AU.3 3/04/18

                              - 20
   evaluator 623 awards the prize by updating the win meter
   stored as part of meter data 643. Assuming there is no
   gamble function, or this is not activated by the player,
   the amount won is then transferred to the credit meter.
 5
   In this gaming system, when there is not a win          (a "non
   winning outcome"), contribution controller 624 causes a
   portion of the amount wagered to be added to a prize pool
   stored as prize pool data 642, for example 1% of the
10 amount wagered. Contributions are not made when there is a
   winning outcome. Prize pool and prize table controller 625
   monitors the prize pool and determines when the prize pool
   has reached a designated value designed around a measure
   of when the prize pool grown sufficiently to cover an
15 increase to a prize amount for one or more of the prizes
   in the prize table. The prize pool and prize table
   controller 625 then dynamically updates the prize table
   643. This update may be advised to the player on the
   display 54 and/or the player may be able to access the
20 prize table at a time of the player's choosing by
   operating the player interface 50. The number and nature
   of the prizes which are updated will depend on the
   implementation. For example, only one prize may be
   updated, all prizes may be updated, or a subset of prizes
25 are updated. The size and conditions for the updates to
   prize amounts are chosen by the game designer to achieve a
   desired return to player. For example, if the return to
   player is 95% and the odds of particular game outcomes
   will result in a return to player of 90% based on the
30 initial prize amounts, then a further 5% needs to be
   returned by appropriate increases to prize amounts during
   play.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that there may
35 be separate prize pools for each award which is to be
   increased and the prize pool and prize table controller
   625 may monitor each pool and increment the prize when a
                                             10133862_1 (GHMatters) P76328.AU.3 3/04/18

                               - 21
   minimum prize display value is one.
   When a prize that has been incremented is won, prize pool
   and prize table controller 625, sets a new prize amount
 5 which may be the same, lower or higher than the initial
   amount, for example by calculating a new amount based on
   the current prize pool or returning it to a designated
   initial value.
10 In a spinning reel game, the gaming system can implement
   the invention in analogous manner with the outcome
   generator selecting symbols for display from a plurality
   of symbol sets corresponding to respective ones of a
   plurality of spinning reels. The symbol sets can specify a
15 sequence of symbols for each reel such that the outcome
   generator can select all of the symbols by selecting a
   stopping position in the sequence. The displayed symbols
   on active win lines or the like are then evaluated to
   determine whether they correspond to a symbol combinations
20 in the pay table. Winning and non-winning outcomes are
   treated in the same manner describe above.
   The method 700 is summarised in Figure 7 and involves
   initiating 710 a game round, generating 720 a game
25 outcome, and evaluating 730 the game outcome. It is then
   determined 740 whether or not the game outcome was a
   winning outcome. For winning outcomes, prizes are awarded
   750 and reset 760  (if necessary). For non-winning
   outcomes, the prize pool is increased 770 and it is
30 determined 780 whether to increased the prize amount. When
   the prize amount is to be increased, the method involves
   dynamically updating the pay table to show the relevant
   updated amount.
35 Examples
   Example 1 - Spinning reel game, incrementing a prize pool
                                             10133862_1 (GHMatters) P76328.AU.3 3/04/18

   on every game, but only displaying the increment when
   minimums are achieved.
   In this game, 1% of all monies bet are accrued to a prize
 5 pool. The prize pool is allocated to some of the
   advertised prizes. The amount allocated to the prizes is
   different for each prize. E.g. 5 Aces is increased by 30%
   of the prize pool (i.e. 0.3% of turnover),     5 Kings and 5
   queens are each increased by 20% of the prize pool                 (ie
10 0.4% of turnover) and 5 jacks, 10 and 9 are each
   increased by 10%  (i.e. 0.3% of turnover).  The increment is
   shown to the player on a dynamically changing prize screen
   whenever the increment amount reaches the equivalent of a
   full credit value

   Spin 1
   Player is playing a spinning reel game. Each credit is
   worth 5c. The player is playing 5 lines of a maximum
20 possible 20 lines and betting 1 credit per play from a
   maximum possible 10 credits per play. Total bet is 5
   credits = 25c.
   The prize pool is incremented by .25 cents.

   the outcome is no win on any lines - player is paid 0
   credits, and the prize for 5* Aces is now incremented by 1
   credit and the prize for 5* Queens is incremented by 1
   credit and the prize pools are reduced for queens and aces

   5*Aces is 0.4 cents
   5* Kings is 4.15 cents
   5* Queens is 0.15 cents

                               - 24
   The outcome is a win on line 1 of 5* queens. Player is
   paid the advertised prize for 5* queens which is the
   standard prize plus the accumulated prize pool which has
   been added to the standard prize. The prize for 5 * Queens
 5 now returns to the standard value but the accumulated
   prize pool for queens remains at 0.15cents.
   Example 2 -  Spinning reel game, incrementing a prize pool
   for each non-winning line
10
   Similar to the above example, however the prize pool is
   incremented for each non-winning line.
   The player is playing 5 lines at 1 credit per line on 5c                          =
15 1 credit. Total bet is 25cents.
   Prize pool is allocated to only one prize namely 5*Aces.
   Spin 1
20 The outcome is a win on line 3 for 2*9 which is not an
   incrementing prize. The player is paid a prize. Lines 1,
   2, 4 and 5 had non-wins, so the prize pool is incremented
   by  .01% of the bet on lines 1, 2, 4 and 5, so prize pool
   is incremented by .01% of 20c =   .2 cents.
25
   Prize pool for 5* Aces increments to 5.1 cents which is 1
   credit plus 0.1 cent. Because there is a non-win on lines
   1, 2, 4 and 5, the prize for 5* Aces is increased by 1
   credit.
