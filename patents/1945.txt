ABSTRACT
A dispensing assembly (100) for dispensing fluid generally includes a container (104) having
a handle (126) located toward an upper portion of the container (104), and a sprayer (106)
having an arm extending away from the sprayer. The arm (142) of the sprayer (106) defines a
channel (158) configured to receive at least part of the handle (126) of the container (104)
within the channel (158) to thereby couple the sprayer (106) to the container (104).
Such a dispensing assembly (100) can be made by forming the container (104) with a handle
(104) located toward an upper portion of the container (104), and forming the sprayer (106)
with the arm (142) such that the arm (142) can be used to couple the sprayer (106) to the handle
(126) of the container (104), where the arm (142) extends away from the sprayer (16) and
defines the channel (158) for receiving at least part of the handle (126) of the container (104)
into the channel (158).

         [0002[    The present disclosure generally relates to dispensing assemblies, and to
methods of making and using such dispensing assemblies.
                                           Background
         [0003[    This section provides background information related to the present disclosure
which is not necessarily prior art.
         [0004[    Fluids such as pesticides and herbicides are often used in and around homes,
lawns and gardens to kill undesirable insects, plants, etc. Typically, the fluids are provided in
bottles. And, sprayers are coupled to the bottles by tubing for applying the fluids to desired
targets.
                                            Summary
         [0005[    This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a
comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.
         [0006[    Example embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to dispensing
assemblies for dispensing fluids.    In one example embodiment, such a dispensing assembly
generally includes a container having a handle located toward an upper portion of the container,
and a sprayer having an arm extending away from an upper surface of the sprayer. The arm
defines a channel configured to receive at least part of the handle of the container within the
channel to thereby couple the sprayer to the container.
         [0007[    In another example embodiment, a dispensing assembly generally includes a
container having an upper portion, and a sprayer having an arm extending away from the

                                      Detailed Description
         [0047[    Example embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to dispensing
assemblies, and to methods of making and using such dispensing assemblies. The dispensing
assemblies can be used to dispense fluids (e.g., desired liquid formulations, etc.) at desired
locations and to apply the fluids at desired targets such as, for example, unwanted pests, plants,
etc.
         [0048[    The dispensing assemblies of the present disclosure generally include
containers for holding the fluids, and sprayers for dispensing the fluids from the containers.
Various sizes of containers may be used. And, various types of sprayers may be used (e.g.,
pump-type sprayers, piston-operated sprayers, powered sprayers (e.g., battery-powered sprayers,
etc.), etc.).

        [0049[      In some aspects of the present disclosure, the sprayers are configured to
couple to the containers, for example, for use in packaging the dispensing assemblies, shipping
the dispensing assemblies, storing the dispensing assemblies, etc.
        [0050[      In some aspects of the present disclosure, the sprayers are configured to at
least partly nest with the containers when coupled thereto. For example, walls of the containers
may define recesses configured to receive (and allow for nesting of) the sprayers within the
recesses when the sprayers are coupled to the containers. In one example embodiment, a front
wall of a container defines a recess configured to receive a sprayer when the sprayer is coupled
to the container (such that the sprayer nests generally within the front wall of the container). As
part of this nesting feature, upper surfaces, portions, etc. of the sprayers may be disposed
generally along, generally coplanar with, generally aligned with, etc. upper surfaces, portions,
etc. of the containers when the sprayers are coupled to the containers. In addition, end (e.g.,
rearward end, forward end, etc.) surfaces, portions, etc. of the sprayers may be disposed
generally along, generally coplanar with, generally aligned with, etc. end (e.g., rearward end,
forward end, etc.) surfaces, portions, etc. of the containers when the sprayers are coupled to the
containers. And further, the sprayers and the containers may be disposed within footprints of the
containers and/or within perimeters defined by the containers when the sprayers are coupled to
the containers.
        [0051[      In some aspects of the present disclosure, the sprayers may have clip portions
configured to engage (e.g., resiliently engage, frictionally engage, engage based on gravity, etc.)
the containers (e.g., handle portions of the containers, other portions of the containers, etc.) for
coupling the sprayers to the containers.     The clip portions may have shapes (e.g., L-shapes,
shapes with lips, arcuate shapes, shapes with tabs, shapes configured to mate with the containers,
etc.) configured to engage the containers.
        [0052[      In some aspects of the present disclosure, clip portions of the sprayers may
include arms extending away from the sprayers and defining channels configured to receive at
least part of the containers within the channels to couple the sprayers to the containers. The arms
may extend at least partly around portions (e.g., handle portions, other portions, etc.) of the
containers to thereby couple the sprayers to the containers      The arms may be monolithically
formed with the sprayers, or the arms may be formed separately from the sprayers and attached
thereto (e.g., welded to the sprayers, staked to the sprayers, frictionally coupled to the sprayers,

releasably coupled to the sprayers, pivotally coupled to the sprayers, etc.). Further, in some
aspects of the present disclosure, the containers may include grooves configured to receive at
least part of the arms of the sprayers into the grooves when the sprayers are coupled to
containers.
         [0053[     In some aspects of the present disclosure, the containers may have handles
located toward upper portions of the containers, and the arms of the sprayers may have shapes
(e.g., L-shapes, shapes with lips, rounded shapes, etc.) configured to extend at least partly around
the handles of the containers to thereby couple the sprayers to the containers. Further, in some
aspects, the handles of the containers may include grooves configured to receive at least part of
the arms of the sprayers into the grooves when the sprayers are coupled to containers.
         [0054[     In some aspects of the present disclosure, the containers may not include
handles located toward upper portions of the containers. Here, the clip portions of the sprayers
may be configured to engage (e.g., resiliently snap-fit to, etc.) other portions of the containers for
coupling the sprayers to the containers. For example, the containers may be formed with other
structure configured to receive the clip portions. And, the sprayers can thus be coupled to the
containers such that upper portions of the sprayers are generally coplanar, aligned, etc. with
upper portions of the containers. In addition, the sprayers may also be disposed within footprints
of the containers and/or within perimeters defined by the containers when the sprayers are
coupled to the containers.
         [0055[     Example embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the
accompanying drawings.
         [0056[     FIGS. 1-20 illustrate an example embodiment of a dispensing assembly 100
according to the present disclosure. The dispensing assembly 100 can be used in applications
such as, for example, pest control, weed control, etc. In connection with such applications, the
dispensing assembly 100 can be used in settings such as residential settings, commercial settings,
etc. in and around homes, businesses, lawns, gardens, etc. And, any desired fluid may be used
(e.g., dispensed, etc.) in connection with the dispensing assembly 100 including, for example,
pesticides, herbicides, other liquid formulations, etc.
         [0057[     As shown in FIGS. I and 2, the dispensing assembly 100 generally includes a
container 104 and a sprayer 106. The container 104 is configured to hold fluid for use in the
desired application of the dispensing assembly 100. And, the sprayer 106 is configured to draw

fluid out of the container 104 for dispensing, applying, etc. the fluid at desired targets (e.g.,
unwanted insects, plants, etc.) associated with the application of the dispensing assembly 100.
         [0058[     The sprayer 106 of the illustrated dispensing assembly 100 can be selectively
coupled to and uncoupled, removed, etc. from the container 104. For example, the sprayer 106
can be coupled (e.g., resiliently snap-fit, etc.) to the container 104 for commercial presentation
(e.g., at the point of sale of the dispensing assembly 100, etc.), for storage, for transport, etc. of
the dispensing assembly 100. Then, the sprayer 106 can be uncoupled from the container 104
when desired to dispense the fluid from the container 104 (via the sprayer 106). And, the sprayer
 106 can then be recoupled (e.g., resiliently snap-fit, etc.) to the container 104 again for storage,
transport, etc. This will be described in more detail hereinafter.
         [0059[     As shown in FIGS. 3-9, the container 104 of the illustrated dispensing
assembly 100 includes an upper portion 110, a lower portion 112, generally opposing forward
and rearward walls 114, 116, and generally opposing side walls 118, 120.          The upper portion
 110, the lower portion 112, and the walls 114, 116, 118, 120 define a volume within the
container 104 for holding fluid.      The container 104 can have any desired volume within the
scope of the present disclosure, for example (and without limitation), a one-half gallon volume, a
one gallon volume, etc.      What's more, the container 104 can be formed from any suitable
materials (e.g., plastics, polymeric resinous material such as high density polyethylene (HDPE),
composite materials, etc.) and/or by any suitable processes (e.g., molding processes, etc.) within
the scope of the present disclosure.
         [0060[     The upper portion 110 of the container 104 includes a spout 124 (broadly, an
opening) and a handle 126. The spout 124 is in fluidic communication with the container 104
and is configured for receiving fluid into the container 104 and/or for use in dispensing fluid
from the container 104. The handle 126 is configured for use in carrying the container 104 (and
sprayer 106). The handle 126 extends generally horizontally along the upper portion 110 of the
container 104, generally between the side wall 120 and the spout 124.            An opening 128 is
defined generally between the handle 126 and an upper surface of the container 104.               The
opening 128 is oriented such that, when a user grasps the handle 126, the user's hand and/or
fingers can extend into the opening 128 and, if desired, around the handle 126. A groove 130 is
provided around at least part of the handle 126 for use in coupling the sprayer 106 to the
container 104 (as will be described in more detail hereinafter).

         [0061[      The container 104 also includes a cap 134 (broadly, a cover) removably
coupled to the spout 124. The cap 134 allows for selectively covering and uncovering the spout
 124 to selectively allow and inhibit access to the fluid in the container 104. In addition, the cap
 134 is configured to fluidically couple the sprayer 106 to the container 104 (as will be described
in more detail hereinafter). In the illustrated embodiment, the cap 134 is threaded onto the spout
 124. However, in other example embodiments, dispensing assemblies may include caps that are
coupled to spouts of containers differently, for example, press-fit onto the spouts, snap-fit onto
the spouts, friction-fit onto the spouts, coupled to the spouts by fasteners, fixedly coupled to the
spouts (e.g., molded as one piece with the spouts, welded to the spouts, coupled to the spouts via
adhesives, etc.), etc.
         [0062[      With reference now to FIGS. 10-15, the sprayer 106 of the illustrated
dispensing assembly 100 includes a head portion 106a, a handle portion 106b, and an actuator
 138 (e.g., a trigger, etc.). The head portion 106a and the handle portion 106b are arranged in a
pistol-style configuration, with the handle portion 106b contoured to receive a hand of a user and
the actuator 138 located adjacent the handle portion 106b to receive a finger of the user's hand.
As such, in use, a user can with one hand grasp the handle portion 106b of the sprayer 106 and
position a finger on the actuator 138 for dispensing fluid from the container 104, and then with
the other hand carry the container 104 via the handle 126. The user can then move the actuator
 138 (e.g., pull the actuator 138 toward the handle portion 106b, pump the actuator 138, etc.) to
thereby dispense fluid from the container 104. As such the dispensing assembly 100 can provide
a mobile unit for a user to quickly and easily dispense fluid at desired targets. The sprayer 106
can include suitable valves and working mechanisms for dispensing (e.g., for drawing, sucking,
etc.) fluid from the container 104 within the scope of the present disclosure. What's more, the
sprayer 106 can be formed from any suitable materials (e.g., plastics, polymeric resinous
material such as high density polyethylene (HDPE), composite materials, etc.) and/or by any
suitable processes (e.g., molding processes, etc.) within the scope of the present disclosure. In
other example embodiments, dispensing assemblies may include sprayers having head portions
and handle portions arranged in configurations other than pistol-style configurations (e.g., head
portions and handle portions arranged in generally linear configurations, etc.).
         [0063[      The sprayer 106 of the illustrated dispensing assembly 100 also includes a clip
portion 106c located adjacent the head portion 106a for use in coupling the sprayer 106 to the

below the arm 142).      The illustrated arm 142 is formed generally continuously with an upper
surface of the head portion 106a and defines a generally L-shape. The L-shape arm 142 includes
a first portion 142a that is generally coplanar, aligned, etc. with the upper surface of the head
portion 106a and a second portion 142b extending generally downwardly from the first portion
 142a. A free end of the first portion 142a is generally rounded, curved, etc. to form a lip 146. In
the illustrated embodiment, the clip portion 106c is formed as one piece (e.g., monolithically,
unitarily, etc.) with the head portion 106a. For example, the clip portion 106c may be molded as
one piece with the head portion 106a.       In other example embodiments, however, dispensing
assemblies may include sprayers with clip portions formed separately from the sprayers and then
subsequently attached thereto.         In addition, in other example embodiments, dispensing
assemblies may include sprayers with clip portions shaped and/or located differently than
illustrated herein, but still configured to couple the sprayers to containers of the dispensing
assemblies. Also in the illustrated embodiment, the second portion 142b of the arm 142 extends
generally downwardly from the first portion 142a at an angle that is greater than about ninety
degrees. In other example embodiments, dispensing assemblies may include sprayers with arms
having second portions that extend downwardly from first portions at angles other than
illustrated herein, for example, about ninety degrees, less than ninety degrees, etc.
         [0064[      The sprayer 106 of the illustrated dispensing assembly 100 further includes
tubing 150 configured to fluidically couple the sprayer 106 to the container 104 for transporting
fluid from the container 104 to the sprayer 106 (for dispensing). The tubing 150 extends through
the handle portion 106b of the sprayer 106 and, at one end portion (not visible), operatively
couples to the head portion 106a of the sprayer 106 (e.g., to valves, pumps, etc. in the sprayer
 106). An opposite end portion 150a of the tubing 150 is then configured to selectively couple to
the cap 134 of the container 104 (e.g., when desired to dispense fluid from the container 104,
etc.). The tubing 150 is generally flexible. And, the flexibility of the tubing 150 permits the
sprayer 106 to be moved in any direction relative to the container 104. With that said, the end
portion 150a of the tubing 150 can couple to the cap 134 of the container 104 by any suitable
operations.    For example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,469,993 (the entire disclosure of
which is incorporated herein by reference), the cap 134 may include a dip tube (not shown)

extending into the container 104 through the spout 124 and a nozzle (e.g., a spout, etc.) (not
shown) in fluidic communication with the dip tube. The tubing 150 can then couple (e.g., via a
connector on the end portion of the tubing 150, etc.) to the nozzle. The nozzle may then be
configured to pivot between an open position in which fluid can be drawn out of the container
 104 by the sprayer 106, and a closed position inhibiting such movement of the fluid (the tubing
 150 may remain coupled to the nozzle, or the tubing 150 may be uncoupled from the nozzle as
desired).
         [0065[    In the illustrated embodiment, the handle portion 106b of the sprayer 106 is
generally hollow. As such, the tubing 150 can be positioned within the handle portion 106b
when not in use (e.g., for storage, etc.). When desired to dispense fluid from the container 104
using the sprayer 106, the tubing 150 can then be removed from the handle portion 106b of the
sprayer 106 and coupled to the container 104, via the cap 134, for providing fluid from the
container 104 to the sprayer 106 through the tubing 150. After such use, the tubing 150 may be
uncoupled from the cap 134 of the container 104 and repositioned within the handle portion 106b
of the sprayer 106 (if desired).     In other example embodiments, dispensing assemblies may
include structure separate from sprayers of the dispensing assemblies for use in holding,
receiving, storing, etc. tubing (e.g., compartments, containers, etc. formed on, coupled to, etc.
containers of the dispensing assemblies).
         [0066[    FIGS. 16-20 illustrate the dispensing assembly 100 with the sprayer 106
coupled to the container 104. The sprayer 106 is disposed generally along the forward wall 114
of the container 104, generally within a recess 154 defined by the forward wall 114. The head
portion 106a of the sprayer 106 is disposed adjacent the opening 128 of the container 104 (e.g.,
next to the opening 128 of the container 104, at least partly in the opening 128 of the container
 104, at the same vertical level as the opening 128 of the container 104, etc.) and toward the side
wall 120 of the container 104. The actuator 138 of the sprayer 106 is located generally above the
recess 154, and at the same general level as the opening 128 of the container 104. A forward
portion of the handle 126 is received within a channel 156 defined by the ribs 144 of the sprayer
 106. And, the arm 142 of the sprayer 106 is positioned over the handle 126, generally within the
groove 130 of the handle 126, with the handle 126 generally received within a channel 158
defined by the arm 142.      In this position, the generally first portion 142a of the arm 142 is
disposed along an upper portion of the handle 126, the generally second portion 142b of the arm

      WO 2014/062560                                                        PCT/US2013/064815
 142 is disposed along a rearward portion of the handle 126, and the lip 146 of the arm 142 is
disposed generally under the handle 126.       In the illustrated embodiment, the arm 142 of the
sprayer 106 is resiliently flexible to accommodate positioning (and repeated repositioning) of the
arm 142 over (and partly around) the handle 126 (e.g., for repeated removal and reattachment of
the sprayer 106 to the handle 126 of the container 104, etc.). As such, the sprayer 106 (via the
arm 142) is resiliently snap fit onto the handle 126 of the container 104 in the illustrated
embodiment. Further, the weight of the sprayer 106 combined with the offset positioning of the
arm 142 (together with the snap fit coupling of the sprayer 106 onto the handle 126 of the
container 104) may help hold (e.g., via a counterbalance effect, etc.) the sprayer on the container
 104. In other example embodiments, dispensing assemblies may include sprayers and containers
where the weight of the sprayers combined with offset positioning of arms on the sprayers help
hold the sprayers on the containers (e.g., with the arms of the sprayers positioned at least partly
over portions of the containers and independent of snap fit couplings of the sprayers onto the
containers, etc.).
         [0067[      To uncouple the sprayer 106 from the container 104, the arm 142 of the
sprayer 106 can be biased to release the lip 146 from under the handle 126. The sprayer 106 can
then be pivoted off the handle 126 to move the entire arm 142 out of the groove 130 of the
handle 126. Alternatively, the sprayer 106 can be initially pivoted away from the forward wall
 114 of the container 104 to release the handle 126 from the channel 156 defined by the ribs 144
of the sprayer 106. And, the arm 142 of the sprayer 106 can then be manipulated to release the
lip 146 from under the handle 126.
         [0068[      As previously stated, in other example embodiments, dispensing assemblies
may include sprayers with clip portions shaped and/or located differently than illustrated herein.
For example, dispensing assemblies may include sprayers having clip portions with arms having
shapes other than L-shapes (e.g., C-shapes, etc.), but that are still configured to couple (e.g.,
snap-fit, etc.) the sprayers to handles of containers of the dispensing assemblies.       Also for
example, dispensing assemblies may include sprayers having clip portions with arms that define
shapes that generally correspond to shapes of handles of containers to which the sprayers are to
be releasably coupled.
         [0069[      In the illustrated embodiment, the clip portion 106c of the sprayer 106
resiliently snap-fits to the handle 126 of the container 104. This allows for quick coupling and

uncoupling of the sprayer 106 to and from the handle 126 of the container 104. In addition, the
clip portion 106c provides a generally self-contained attachment means of the sprayer 106 to the
container 104. Additional fasteners are not required to couple the sprayer 106 to the container
 104. Further, the clip portion 106c securely couples the sprayer 106 to the container 104 against
inadvertent removal such that, in preparation for initial shipping and sale of the dispensing
assembly 100, additional securing means (e.g., adhesive such as glue and tape, mechanical
straps, shrink wrap, etc.) are not required for securing the sprayer 106 to the container 104.
         [0070[    Also in the illustrated embodiment, the sprayer 106 is coupled to the container
 104 generally within a footprint defined by the container 104 (see, e.g., FIG. 15, etc.), and
generally within a perimeter defined by the upper portion 110, lower portion 112, and walls 114,
 116, 118, 120 of the container 104 (see, e.g., FIGS. 16 and 17, etc.). The recess 154 defined by
the forward wall 114 of the container 104 is configured to accommodate and receive
substantially the entire sprayer 106 (e.g., the sprayer 106 nests within the recess 154 against the
forward wall 114 of the container 104, etc.). As such, a forward side surface of the sprayer 106
is generally flush with a non-recessed surface portion of the forward wall 114. In addition, an
upper surface of the head portion 106a and clip portion 106c of the sprayer 106 are generally
flush, coplanar, etc. with the upper surface of the handle 126.       And, a right side surface (as
viewed in FIG. 18) of the sprayer 106 is generally flush with the side wall 120 of the container
 104. Thus, the sprayer 106 occupies no additional shelf space or box space than the container
 104 would without the sprayer 106, which can allow the dispensing assembly 100 to be
compactly boxed, stored, shipped, displayed, etc.
         [0071[    Also in the illustrated embodiment, the sprayer 106 is coupled to the handle
 126 of the container 104 toward the upper portion of the container 104. As such, the recess 154
defined by the forward wall 114 of the container 104 is positioned generally higher on the
container 104 which provides more volume within the container 104 below the recess 154 (as
compared to other known containers).         As a result, the overall depth of the container 104
(extending between the forward wall 114 and rearward wall 116) can be reduced without
decreasing a total volume of the container 104. For example, the depth of the container 104 may
be reduced by at least about 0.25 inches or more without decreasing the total volume of the
container 104. In turn, the footprint of the container 104 can be reduced without decreasing the
total volume of the container 104. What's more, the actuator 138 of the sprayer 106 is located
                                                   12

generally above the recess 154, such that the recess can have a generally generic shape without
having to specifically accommodate the actuator 138.
         [0072[      Further in the illustrated embodiment, the sprayer 106 is coupled to the
container 104 along the forward wall 114 of the container 104. This positions the sprayer 106 in
an immediately visible location to users (e.g., consumers, etc.) considering the dispensing
assembly 100. As such, the sprayer 106 (e.g., the type of the sprayer 106, the size of the sprayer
 106, etc.) can be readily considered by consumers viewing the dispensing assembly 100 on a
shelf at a retail location in deciding to purchase the dispensing assembly 100.
         [0073[      The dispensing assembly 100 of the illustrated embodiment further provides a
ready to use system for dispensing fluid.       For example, the dispensing assembly 100 can be
provided to a user with a premixed ready to spray liquid formulation in the container 104 and the
sprayer 106 coupled to the container 104 ready for use to dispense the liquid formulation from
the container 104. The sprayer 106 is simply uncoupled from the container 104, and the tubing
 150 then coupled to the cap 134 of the container 104. The actuator 138 of the sprayer 106 can
then be moved to draw fluid out of the container 104 for discharge onto desired targets. As such,
the dispensing assembly 100 is shelf ready (e.g., ready for retailers to place on shelves for sale to
consumers and ready for immediate use by consumers, etc.).
         [0074[      FIGS. 21 and 22 illustrate another example embodiment of a dispensing
assembly 200 according to the present disclosure. The dispensing assembly 200 is substantially
similar to the dispensing assembly 100 illustrated in FIGS. 1-20. For example, the dispensing
assembly 200 generally includes a container 204 and a sprayer 206. And, the sprayer 206 is
configured to couple to the container 204 (in similar fashion to that previously described for the
dispensing assembly 100). In this embodiment, however, the sprayer 206 includes separate first
and second body portions 206d, 206e, as well as a separate arm 242. The first and second body
portions 206d, 206e are coupled (e.g., welded, etc.) together along joint 270, and the arm 242 is
coupled (e.g., welded, etc.) to the second body 206e portion along joint 272. As such, in this
example embodiment, the arm 242 can be formed separate from the body portions 206d, 206e of
the sprayer 206 and subsequently coupled thereto as desired (e.g., when assembling the sprayer
206, when assembling the dispensing assembly 200, etc.).             With that said, it should be
appreciated that the body portions 206d, 206e of the sprayer 206 and the arm 242 of the sprayer
206 can be formed from any suitable process (e.g., a molding process, etc.).

          [0075[    FIGS. 23-26 illustrate another example embodiment of a dispensing assembly
300 according to the present disclosure.      The dispensing assembly 300 of this embodiment is
substantially similar to the dispensing assembly 100 illustrated in FIGS. 1-20. For example, the
dispensing assembly generally includes a container 304 and a sprayer 306. And, the sprayer 306
is configured to couple to the container 304 (in similar fashion to that previously described for
the dispensing assembly 100). In this embodiment, however, the sprayer 306 includes an arm
342 formed separate from the sprayer 306 and coupled thereto.          In particular, the sprayer 306
includes a tab 376 formed along an upper side portion of the sprayer 306, and the arm 342
includes a recess 378. The recess 378 of the arm 342 is configured to fit over the tab 376 of the
sprayer 306, such that the arm 342 can be press-fit (e.g., compression fit, resistance fit, friction
fit, etc.) onto the sprayer 306. Thus, in this embodiment, the arm 342 can again be formed
separate from the sprayer 306 and subsequently coupled thereto as desired (e.g., when
assembling the sprayer 306, when assembling the dispensing assembly 300, etc.). It should be
appreciated that the sprayer 306 and the arm 342 of the sprayer 306 can be formed from any
suitable process (e.g., a molding process, etc.). In some aspects of the present disclosure, the
arm 342 may be further secured to the sprayer 306 by additional means (e.g., heat stake, welds
(e.g., sonic welds, etc.), adhesive (e.g., glue, etc.), mechanical fasteners, etc.). In these aspects,
the tab 376 of the sprayer 306 and the recess 378 of the arm 342 also operate to help align the
arm 342 on the sprayer 306 prior to securing the arm 342 to the sprayer 306 via the additional
means.
          [0076[    In other example embodiments, dispensing assemblies may include sprayers
similar to the sprayer 306 of the dispensing assembly 300, but where arms of the sprayers
include tabs and where the sprayers include recesses configured to receive the tabs of the arms
for use in press-fitting the arms onto the sprayers. As such, it should be appreciated that any
desired combination and/or any desired number of mating components (e.g., male/female
components, etc.) could be used with sprayers and arms for coupling them together within the
scope of the present disclosure, for example, tabs, recesses, nubs, openings, notches, flanges,
flanges with lips, etc. What's more, the mating components may have any suitable configuration
(e.g., horizontal flanges configured to be received in corresponding openings, L-shaped flanges
configured to be received in corresponding openings, nubs configured to be received in
corresponding openings, pins configured to be received in corresponding openings, protrusions

configured to be received in corresponding recesses, etc.). Still further, the mating components
may also operate to help align the arms with the sprayers when coupling them together (with
additional means (as described herein) then also used to help secure the arms to the sprayers).
         [0077[      In one example embodiment, a dispensing assembly includes a sprayer with
an arm having a flange extending generally downwardly at an angle (e.g., about ninety degrees,
greater than about ninety degrees, less than about ninety degrees, etc.) from the arm. And, the
sprayer includes an opening (e.g., in a side surface of the sprayer, etc.) configured to receive
(e.g., to hook, etc.) the flange therein (e.g., in a nesting fashion, etc.) for use in coupling the arm
to the sprayer.    In some aspects, the arm may then be further secured to the sprayer 306 by
additional means (e.g., heat stake, welds (e.g., sonic welds, etc.), adhesive (e.g., glue, etc.),
mechanical fasteners, etc.).
         [0078[      In another example embodiment, a dispensing assembly includes a sprayer
with an arm having a flange extending generally outwardly from an upper surface of the arm

sprayer includes a notch opening (e.g., in an upper surface of the sprayer, etc.) configured to
receive the flange therein (e.g., in a nesting fashion, etc.) for use in coupling the arm to the
sprayer. In some aspects, the arm may then be further secured to the sprayer 306 by additional

an opening (e.g., in a side surface of the sprayer, in an upper surface of the sprayer, etc.)
configured to receive the flange therein for use in coupling the arm to the sprayer. The flange of
the arm includes protrusions (e.g., dimples, tabs, etc.), and the opening of the sprayer includes
corresponding recesses, voids, etc. defined therein for receiving the protrusions to thereby
provide a snap-fit coupling between the arm and the sprayer (e.g., a permanent snap-fit coupling,

handle 426, and a right side surface (as viewed in FIG. 27) of the sprayer 406 is generally flush
with a side wall 420 of the container 404.
         [0083[     In use, to uncouple the sprayer 406 from the container 404, the sprayer 406 is
separated from the arm 442 by moving the tab 476 of the sprayer 406 out of the slot 478 of the
arm 442.      The arm 442 remains coupled to the handle 426 of the container 404.        Then, to
recouple the sprayer 406 to the container 404, the tab 476 of the sprayer 406 is positioned (e.g.,
slid, etc.) back within the recess 478 of the arm 442.
         [0084[     FIGS. 31 and 32 illustrate another example embodiment of a dispensing
assembly 500 according to the present disclosure. The dispensing assembly 500 is substantially
similar to the dispensing assembly 100 illustrated in FIGS. 1-20. For example, the dispensing
assembly 500 generally includes a container 504 and a sprayer 506. And, the sprayer 506 is
configured to couple to the container 504.        In this embodiment, however, the sprayer 506
includes an arm 542 with a generally arcuate shape. The arm 542 can be formed as one piece
with the sprayer 506, or the arm 542 can be formed separate from the sprayer 506 and coupled
thereto within the scope of the present disclosure. In addition, the arm 542 may be resiliently
flexible to help provide a friction fit between the arm 542 and the handle 526 (to thereby help
hold the sprayer 506 on the container 504). In use, the sprayer 506 couples to the container 504
by positioning the arm 542 over a handle 526 of the container 504 (e.g., within a groove 530
provided around at least part of the handle 526, etc.). In this position, a forward portion of the
handle 526 is received within a channel 556 defined by ribs 544 of the sprayer 506. The arm 542
may be resiliently flexible to help provide a friction fit between the arm 542 and the handle 526
(to thereby help hold the sprayer 506 on the container 504). Further, the weight of the sprayer
506 (combined with the offset positioning of the arm 542) may also help hold the sprayer 506 on
the container 504. Ribs may be provided along the arm 542 and/or along the sprayer 506 to help
reinforce the arm 542, for example, when flexing the arm 542 to couple the sprayer 506 to the
container 504, etc.
         [0085[     FIGS. 33-35 illustrate another example embodiment of a dispensing assembly
600 according to the present disclosure. The dispensing assembly 600 is substantially similar to
the dispensing assembly 100 illustrated in FIGS. 1-20.       For example, the dispensing assembly
600 generally includes a container 604 and a sprayer 606. And, the sprayer 606 is configured to
couple to the container 604 (in similar fashion to that previously described for the dispensing
                                                  17

      WO 2014/062560                                                           PCT/US2013/064815
assembly 100). In this embodiment, the sprayer 606 includes an arm 642 pivotally coupled to
the sprayer 606 along hinge 684. The arm 642 can be formed as one piece (e.g., monolithically,
etc.) with the sprayer 606 such that the hinge 684 is a living hinge coupling the arm 642 to the
sprayer 606. Or, the arm 642 can be formed separate from the sprayer 606 and pivotally coupled
thereto via the hinge 684 (e.g., using a piano hinge, etc.). Ribs 644a are formed along an upper
portion of the arm 642. And, corresponding ribs 644b are formed along an upper portion of the
sprayer 606 which are configured to abut the ribs 644a of the arm 642 when the arm 642 is
pivoted upward into position for coupling the sprayer 606 to the container 604. The arm 642
and/or container 604 may further include structure (e.g., tabs, etc.) that operate to secure the arm
642 in the position for coupling the sprayer 606 to the container 604 (e.g., upon pivoting the arm
606 upward, etc.).
         [0086[      Thus, in this embodiment, the sprayer 606 can be initially formed with the
arm 642 positioned generally downward (e.g., adjacent a handle portion 606b of the sprayer 606,
etc.) and not extended (e.g., for shipping, etc.) (FIG. 34). The arm 642 can then be extended, for
example, when assembling the dispensing assembly 600 so that the sprayer 606 can be coupled
to the container 604 (FIG. 35). It should be appreciated that the arm 642 of the sprayer 606 can
have any desired shape within the scope of the present disclosure such as, for example, an L
shape as illustrated in FIGS. 33-35, a C-shape, etc.
         [0087[      In other example       embodiments      of the present   disclosure,  dispensing
assemblies generally includes containers and sprayers. In one of these example embodiments, a
container has a height of about 12 inches, a width of about 7.75 inches, and a depth of about 4.25
inches. A handle opening of the container has a width of about 3.47 inches and a height of about
0.79 inches. And, a sprayer has a height of about 6.1 inches, a width of about 3.3 inches, and a
depth of about 1.1 inches.
         [0088[      In other example       embodiments      of the present   disclosure,  dispensing
assemblies may include sprayers and containers, where the sprayers include arms configured to
resiliently snap-fit to vertical portions of handles of the containers. In so doing, the sprayers may
be located within recesses defined by walls of the containers, and upper surfaces of the sprayers
may be generally aligned with upper surfaces of the containers, when the sprayers are coupled to
the containers. Here, the handles may be oriented along upper surfaces of the containers, along
vertical surfaces (e.g., side walls, etc.) of the containers, etc.

         [0089[     In other example embodiments of the present disclosure, dispensing
assemblies may include sprayers and containers where the sprayers include arms shaped
substantially similar to the arms disclosure herein (e.g., arms 142, 242, 342, 442, 542, 642, etc.),
but generally inverted. Here, the arms of the sprayers may be resiliently flexible to help provide
a snap-fit coupling of the arms generally under (and at least partly around) the handles of the
containers. For example, first portions of the arms may be disposed along lower portions of the
handles, second portions of the arms may be disposed along rearward portions of the handles,
and lips of the arms may be disposed generally over the handles.
         [0090[     In other example embodiments of the present disclosure, dispensing
assemblies may include sprayers and containers where the sprayers (e.g., clip portions of the
sprayers, etc.) couple to portions of the containers other than the handles. In these example
embodiments, the sprayers are still located generally higher on the containers (when coupled to
the containers) such that, for example, upper portions of the sprayers are still positioned
generally coplanar, aligned, flush, etc. with upper portions of the containers (e.g., with upper
portions of the handles of the containers when the containers include handles along their upper
portions; with upper portions, upper surfaces, etc. of the containers when the containers do not
include upper handles, etc.). For example, the sprayers may couple to upper surfaces of the
containers below the handles (e.g., within openings defined below the handles, etc.), or to upper
surfaces of the containers when the containers do not include such upper handles, or to side
surfaces of the containers, or to vertical portions of handles of the containers, etc. Also for
example, the sprayers may couple to the containers within openings defined below the handles of
the containers (e.g., to upper surfaces of the containers below the handles and/or to lower
surfaces of the of the handles.
