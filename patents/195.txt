METHOD OF HOST-DIRECTED ILLUMINATION AND SYSTEM FOR
CONDUCTING HOST-DIRECTED ILLUMINATION
RELATED APPLICATIONS DATA
[0001]      This application is a divisional application of
Australian Patent Application No.   2012211507 which,  in turn, claims
priority under the Paris Convention to USSN 13/209,663 filed in
the United States Patent and Trademark Office on 15 August 2011,
the contents of each of the parent and the basic applications are
incorporated herein by way of cross-reference in their entirety.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 [0002]     This invention relates generally to methods and systems
for verifying the validity of biometric data, and more particularly,
to a method of host-directed illumination for verifying the validity
of biometric data captured from a user at a remote location and
a system for conducting such host-directed illumination.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 [00031     Typically, during network-based biometric authentication
transactions conducted with a user at a remote location, the user
requesting authentication provides a claim of identity and biometric
data.   However, imposters have been known to impersonate users during
remotely conducted network-based biometric authentication
transactions by providing a false claim of identity supported by
fraudulent biometric data in an effort to deceive an authenticating
entity into concluding that the imposter is the person they claim
to be.    Such impersonations are known as spoofing.
 [0004]     Impostors currently use many methods to obtain or create
fraudulent biometric data of others that can be submitted during
authentication transactions.     For facial biometric data imposters
have been known to obtain two-dimensional pictures of others,      from
social networking sites such as Facebook, which can be presented

to a camera during authentication to support a false claim of
identity.      Imposters have also been known to create fraudulent
biometric data by making a physical model of a biometric modality,
such as a fingerprint using gelatin or a three-dimensional face
using a custom mannequin.             Moreover, imposters have been known to
eavesdrop on networks during legitimate network-based biometric
authentication transactions to surreptitiously obtain genuine
biometric data of users.             The imposters then use the obtained
biometric data for playback during fraudulent network-based
authentication transactions.                Such fraudulent biometric data are
known to be difficult to detect using known liveness detection
methods.     Consequently, accurately conducting network-based
biometric authentication          transactions      with biometric data captured
from a user at a remote location depends on verifying                    the physical
presence of the user during the authentication               transaction      as well
as accurately verifying        the identity        of the user with the captured
biometric data.       Verifying that        the biometric data presented during
a network-based biometric authentication transaction conducted at
a remote location is        from a live person at the remote location,
is known as liveness detection or anti-spoofing.
[00051       Methods of liveness detection have been known to use
structure derived from motion of a biometric modality, such as a
face,  to distinguish      a live      user from a photographic image.          Other
methods have been known to detect sequential images of eyes                      or
eyeblink techniques        to determine if face biometric data is               from
a live  user.    However,   such methods may not detect spoofing attempts
that use high definition video playback to present fraudulent
biometric data, and therefore do not provide high confidence
liveness detection support for entities dependent upon accurate
biometric authentication transaction results.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[00061       Accordingly, the present invention provides a liveness
detection system including a processor, and a memory configured

to store  user enrollment data records.        The processor is       programmed
to randomly select a different combination of instructions from
an instruction listing for each authentication transaction.
Moreover,  the processor is     also programmed to compare illumination
characteristics included in biometric data captured from a user
while executing the selected instructions against corresponding
illumination characteristics         expected to result     from capturing the
biometric data to determine whether the user is live, wherein the
captured biometric data including a biometric data component and
illuminations characteristics         generated as a result    of illuminating
the biometric data.
 [0007]     In another broad aspect, the present invention provides
a liveness detection system including a processor, and a memory
configured to store user enrollment data records.                The processor
is programmed to randomly select illumination instructions from
an illumination instruction listing, and compare illumination
characteristics included in biometric data captured from a user
against corresponding illumination characteristics expected to
result from capturing the biometric data to determine whether the
user is live, the biometric data being captured while executing
selected instructions.        Moreover, the processor is         further
programmed to determine illumination characteristic differences
between sequential       images included in captured biometric data,
compare determined illumination characteristic           differences against
corresponding expected illumination characteristic differences
stored in said memory, and determine the user is               live when less
than all  of the determined illumination characteristic              differences
match the corresponding expected illumination characteristic
difference.
 [00081     In another broad aspect, the present invention provides
a method of host-directed illumination including executing
instructions, by a portable authentication device, received over
a network from a host authentication        computer hardware system while

the authentication        device captures biometric data from a user,    the
captured biometric data including illumination characteristics
generated as a result of illuminating the biometric data during
capture, the authentication device being remote from the host
authentication computer hardware system.            Moreover, the method
includes separating the captured biometric data from the
illumination characteristics.           The method further includes
determining illumination characteristic differences between
sequential images, the sequential           images being included in the
captured biometric data.          The method further includes comparing
the determined illumination characteristic differences against
corresponding expected illumination characteristic differences
included in       a user enrollment data record.    Furthermore,  the method
includes determining the user is live when less than all of the
determined illumination characteristic differences match the
corresponding expected illumination characteristic difference.
[00091         In another broad aspect, the present invention further
provides a portable device used for host-directed illumination
including a processor, and a memory configured to store user
enrollment data records.          The memory is in communication with the
processor and has instructions         stored thereon which,  when executed
by said processor,       cause said processor to perform operations,   which
include executing instructions         received over a network from a host
authentication       computer hardware system remote from the device while
the device captures biometric data from a user, wherein the captured
biometric data including illumination characteristics generated
as a result of illuminating the biometric data during capture.
The    instructions, when executed by the processor, further cause
the processor to perform operations which include:           separating the
captured biometric data from the illumination characteristics;
determining illumination characteristic differences between
sequential images, wherein the images being included in         the captured
biometric data;        comparing the determined illumination
characteristic differences against corresponding expected

illumination characteristic differences included in the user
enrollment data record;              and determining that      the user is   live  when
less than all of the determined illumination characteristic
differences match the corresponding expected illumination
characteristic difference.
 [0010]          In another broad aspect, a method of host-directed
illumination for verifying              the validity     of biometric data of a user
is   provided that           includes capturing biometric data from a user with
an authentication device during authentication, and directing
illumination of the biometric data during the capturing operation
from a host authentication system.                    Moreover, the method includes
comparing illumination characteristics of the captured biometric
data against illumination characteristics                   expected to result      from
the directing operation, and determining that the user is a live
user when the illumination characteristics                 of the captured biometric
data match the illumination characteristics                  expected to result     from
the directing operation.
 [0011]          In   another broad aspect,         a computer system for verifying
the validity of biometric data presented by a user during
authentication transactions is provided.                     The computer system
includes a service provider system associated with a business
engaged in        controlling      access to resources and that      contains a data
base.        The service provider system is            configured to control access
to resources relating to users enrolled therein and to conduct
transactions.              Moreover, the computer system includes a host
authentication system that includes an authentication database.
The host authentication system is configured to communicate with
the service provider system over a network, to randomly select
instructions          stored therein     to be executed while capturing biometric
data, to store at least enrollment biometric data of a plurality
of users,       to determine the liveness of a user requesting to conduct
a transaction          requiring access to the resources stored in         the service
provider system, and to authenticate users determined to be live

users.      Furthermore,   the computer system includes an authentication
device configured to communicate with the service provider system
and the host authentication            system over the network,     to illuminate
the biometric modality presented by the user, and to capture
biometric authentication data.
 [0012]        The host authentication         system is   further  configured to
direct the authentication device to illuminate the presented
biometric modality, compare illumination characteristics of
captured biometric data against illumination characteristics
expected to result from illuminating the presented biometric
modality, and determine that the user is                a live user when the
illumination characteristics             of the captured biometric data match
the illumination characteristics expected to result from
illuminating the presented biometric modality.
 [0013]        In yet another broad aspect,         a computer program recorded
on a non-transitory computer-readable recording medium, included
in an authentication computer system, for verifying the validity
of biometric data presented by a user attempting to conduct a
network-based transaction           is  provided.    The computer program causes
the authentication computer system to execute at least randomly
selecting     at least   one instruction        stored in  a host authentication
system and transmitting the at least one instruction to an
authentication device.           Moreover, the computer program causes the
authentication computer system to execute the at least one
instruction with the authentication device while capturing
biometric data from the user with the authentication device.                      The
biometric data is captured as a sequence of photographic images
that     each include a captured biometric data component and captured
illumination characteristics.               Furthermore, the computer program
causes the authentication           computer system to transmit the captured
biometric data to the host authentication system, and to compare
each of the captured illumination characteristics against
corresponding expected illumination characteristics.                    When the

captured illumination characteristics match the corresponding
expected illumination characteristic the computer program causes
the authentication computer system to determine that the user is
a live user.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0019]     Figure 1 is an expanded block diagram of an exemplary
embodiment of a system architecture of an Authentication Computer
(AC) System 10 for verifying     the validity      of biometric data presented
by a user during authentication transactions.                More specifically,
the AC system 10 includes a Remote Authentication                 (RA) Device 12,

a Service Provider (SP)          System 14, and a Host Authentication Computer
 (HAC) System 16.
 [0020]      The RA device 12 is           a smart phone that at least stores
applications therein, displays at least one of text and images,
receives and executes specific            instructions       regarding illumination
during authentication,           and captures authentication         data from a user.
  The RA device 12 includes a front             face 18,    a back face   (not shown),
at least  one camera (not shown),          and at least      one illumination device
 (not shown).      Each of the front         18 and back faces may include at
least one camera.            At least one camera        (not shown),   different from
the RA device 12,           may also be attached to the RA device             12 such
that the attached at least one camera is capable of any type of
movement.     Moreover, each of the front and back faces may include
at least one illumination device arranged in any manner or in any
pattern thereon.            The at least one illumination device may be any
device capable of illuminating biometric data in accordance with
illumination instructions as described herein.                      It should be
appreciated that           any combination of illumination devices included
in  the at least     one illumination device may be operated at different
times to generate different           detectable illumination characteristics
of a presented biometric modality while capturing biometric data.
 [0021]      The     front face 18 includes at least one of buttons and
icons 20 for at least entering commands and invoking applications
stored in   the RA device 12.          Furthermore,       the front  face 18 includes
a display screen 22 such as, but not limited to, a Liquid Crystal
Display   (LCD),      that    displays at least        one of text   and images.    The
display screen 22 may constitute the at least one illumination
device.   Additionally,          the display screen 22 may include the buttons
and icons 20.         Applications stored in the RA device 12 include at
least a security application that causes the RA device 12 to at
least operate the at least one illumination device in response to
illumination instructions received from the HAC system 16.

 [0022]         Although the RA device 12 is           a smart phone,    the RA device
12 may alternatively be any device capable of at least displaying
at least one of text and images, and capturing and transmitting
data.     Such other devices include, but are not limited to, a portable
cellular phone, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, any type of
portable communications device having wireless capabilities such
as a personal digital assistant                  (PDA),  and a personal computer.
 [0023]         The RA device 12 is           configured to communicate with at
least    the SP system 14 and the HAC system 16 over a communications
network 24.          The communications network 24 is a 3G communications
network.        Alternatively,         the communications     network 24 may be any
wireless network including, but not limited to, Wi-Fi,                  Global System
for Mobile        (GSM),       Enhanced Data for GSM Evolution       (EDGE),       and any
combination of a local area network (LAN),                 a wide area network (WAN)
and the Internet.            Moreover,   the RA device 12 is   configured to conduct
at least long range wireless communications such as cellular
telephone calls and to wirelessly access the Internet over the
network 24.        Furthermore,       the RA device 12 may capture authentication
data from users and transmit it              to the HAC system 16.    Alternatively,
the RA device 12 may process the captured authentication                     data prior
to transmitting           it   to the HAC system 16.     For example,    the RA device
12 may capture biometric authentication data, create a biometric
template from the captured data, and then transmit the biometric
template to the HAC system 16.               The RA device 12 does not permanently
store captured authentication data, biometric templates, or any
other information that              may be derived from captured authentication
data.
 [0024]         The SP system 14 is         a computer including components such
as, but not limited to, a database server, an application server,
a directory        server,       a web server,    and a disk storage unit        that  may
be used to store           any kind of data.        The disk storage unit      may store
at least      one database.          The SP system 14 is     configured to at least
communicate with the RA device                 12 and the HAC system 16 over the

network 24,    and control access to resources.        Resources as described
herein include anything that may be protected against access by
unauthorized users.       Consequently, resources may include, but are
not limited to,     financial accounts, data of any type and of any
form, electronic artifacts,          services, computer systems,
applications, buildings, rooms within buildings, and automobiles.
[0025]      Electronic artifacts include items such as, but not
limited to, web documents.          Services include, but are not limited
to,  checking-out an electronic shopping cart at a website and
conducting a payment transaction.            Computer systems include, but
are not limited to, virtual      private    networks and such other networks
or computer systems      running such networks.           Applications as
described herein are computer programs.           For example,        applications
as described herein may include, but are not limited to, applications
that facilitate performing privileged communications and
applications that permit access to privileged information.                           It
should be understood that such applications are made available to
a user only upon authentication of the identity of the user.
Moreover,   it   should be understood that      by virtue       of protecting          the
applications, the functions performed by those applications are
also protected.     Thus,  by virtue     of granting access to applications
upon authentication of the identity of the user, access is                         also
granted to the functions performed by those applications.
Consequently, it should be appreciated that functions caused to
be performed on a computer or computer system by applications                    stored
throughout the AC system 10,           also constitute resources.
[0026]       In the exemplary embodiment, the SP system 14 is
associated with a financial institution.              Thus, the SP system 14
stores and controls access to at least the financial accounts for
each of a plurality of financial institution customers and
facilitates conducting transactions involving the financial
accounts.      By virtue of controlling who may access financial
accounts,  the SP system 14 also facilitates        controlling        the movement

of funds within accounts.            Moreover,      the SP system 14 stores                therein
at least    biographic data for each customer such that                           the biographic
data of each customer is             associated with the financial accounts
of the customer as well as a respective service provider user
identifier.       Biographic data includes any demographic information
regarding an individual including, but not                         limited to,          an
individual's name,           age, date of birth, address, citizenship and
marital status.         Furthermore, the SP system 14 may store therein
policies for at least determining whether a user is authorized to
access resources controlled            by the SP system 14.             As described herein
an authorized user is          a customer of the financial                institution        having
financial accounts stored in and controlled by the SP system 14.
  Such users are authorized to access their                     financial           accounts,      and
conduct transactions           involving their       financial        accounts after           being
successfully authenticated.
 [0027]       Although the SP system 14 is                associated with a financial
institution      the SP system 14 is      in   no way limited to being associated
with a financial       institution.        Alternatively,             the SP system 14 may
be associated with any type of business or entity that controls
access to resources.           For example,     the SP system 14 may be associated
with a security      service company that           facilitates           controlling        access
to buildings.        Although the AC system 10 includes one SP system
14 associated with a financial institution, the AC system 10 may
alternatively include a plurality of SP systems                              14 that are each
associated with a different business or entity.
 [0028]       The   SP system 14 generally does not include rigorous
authentication capabilities.               The HAC system 16                 is designed to
quickly connect to,           and provide rigorous authentication
capabilities to,        operators of the SP system 14.                         By keeping the
HAC system 16 separate from the SP system 14,                           and accessing the
HAC system 16 as a managed service, the operator of the SP system
14 is able to secure rigorous authentication capabilities without
purchasing hardware and software to implement such capabilities

and without incurring costs              associated with training           employees    to
use the HAC system hardware and software.                   Consequently, the HAC
system 16 may facilitate quickly and inexpensively retrofitting
the SP system 14 to provide rigorous authentication.                       The SP system
14 and the HAC system 16 are not the same device or system.
Alternatively, the SP system 14 and the HAC system 16 may be the
same device or system.
[0029]          The HAC system 16 includes components such as, but not
limited to,        a web server,    a database server,      an application       server,
a directory        server and a disk storage unit      that    may be used to store
any kind of data.             The disk storage unit may store at least one
database such as, but not limited to, an authentication database.
 The HAC system 16 also includes a database management server and
an authentication server.               The database management server may be
used to facilitate transferring data to and from the disk storage
device.      The authentication        server performs matching of any feature
or information associated with individuals to authenticate the
identity of individuals             as described herein.
[00301          The HAC system 16 is configured to communicate with the
RA device 12 and the SP system 14 over the network 24.                         Moreover,
the HAC system 16 may perform functions including,                    but not limited
to, authenticating          users, storing   at least one authentication          policy
for determining at least one biometric modality to be used for
authentication, storing at least authentication data of each of
a plurality of authorized users in a respective enrollment data
record, and determining the liveness of a user requesting access
to resources controlled           by the SP system 14.    Although the HAC system
16   is configured to communicate with a single SP system 14 and a
single RA device 12,            the HAC system 16 may alternatively be
configured to communicate with any number of SP systems 14 and any
number of RA devices            12.

 [0031]      The authentication data is biometric data that
corresponds to any biometric modality desired to be used as the
basis of authenticating a user requesting authentication.                    Such
biometric modalities include,        but are not limited to, face,        finger,
iris,   and palm, and any combination of face,         finger,   iris   and palm.
  The biometric data may take any form such as,           but not limited to,
photographic images.      The enrollment data record of each authorized
user stored in the HAC system 16            includes at least enrollment
biometric data,    a unique user identifier,         and the service provider
user identifier of the respective authorized user.                  Enrollment
biometric data is biometric data obtained from the user during
enrollment. The unique user identifier and service provider user
identifier are alphanumeric text            strings of any length and are
different.     By virtue of being stored in the same enrollment data
record,   the enrollment biometric data,         the unique user identifier,
and the service provider user identifier of each authorized user
are associated with each other. Alternatively, such data may be
stored in separate records with links to each other. Biographic
data may also be included in the enrollment data records.
 [0032]      The HAC system 16 may also perform functions such as,
but not limited to, storing     a plurality     of illumination instructions
and expected illumination characteristics, and randomly selecting
illumination instructions      to be executed while capturing biometric
data during authentication transactions.              The randomly selected
illumination instructions      each require executing an action during
authentication that effects illumination characteristics of the
biometric modality presented for capture as a photographic image.
  Because each illumination instruction is randomly selected,
illumination of the biometric modality during authentication is
not known in   advance to an imposter and thus appears unpredictable.
  Consequently, due to the number of different combinations of
illumination instructions      that     may be randomly selected       by the HAC
system 16,    the randomly selected illumination instructions
constitute an unpredictable condition injected into biometric

authentication transactions by the HAC system 16 that facilitate
making it more difficult for imposters to successfully spoof the
HAC system 16.
 [00331         Moreover, the HAC system 16 may perform functions such
as, but not limited to, generating illumination characteristics,
and recognizing a distinctive pattern of an illumination
characteristic generated as a result of executing any of the
illumination instructions.           An illumination instruction executed
while capturing biometric data during authentication generates a
captured illumination characteristic                  (CIC), and an illumination
instruction       executed while collecting         the enrollment biometric data
generates an expected illumination characteristic                   (EIC).      The
expected illumination characteristic                  (EIC) is the illumination
characteristic expected to be generated as a result of executing
the selected illumination instructions while capturing biometric
data during authentication.           It should be understood that the HAC
system 16 may also recognize illumination characteristics in the
form of involuntary movements or reactions of a biometric modality
generated as a result of applying illumination in accordance with
any of the illumination instructions.
 [0034]         Illumination characteristics are generated as a result
of illuminating an object.           Illumination may reflect off of the
object, may be absorbed by the object,               create shadows of the object,
or create patterns on the object.                  Such reflection, absorption,
shadow, and pattern effects generated as a result of illuminating
an object are examples of illumination characteristics.                    The same
type of illumination may react         differently       when applied to different
objects such that       the same type of illumination generates different
illumination characteristics.              For example, the illumination
characteristics       of a two-dimensional photograph of a user subjected
to a given illumination are different than those of a
three-dimensional face of the user subjected to the same
illumination.        Thus, it should be understood that          a two-dimensional

photograph used by an imposter attempting to spoof a facial                 biometric
authentication system may be distinguished from the expected
presence of three-dimensional face biometric data using the
illumination characteristics generated by the same illumination
applied to each.
[00351          Moreover, illumination may cause involuntary movements
or reactions in a presented biometric modality.                   Such involuntary
movements or reactions of a presented biometric modality are also
considered illumination characteristics.                  For example,    when a live
iris is the biometric modality required for biometric
authentication, increasing or decreasing the illumination applied
to the live iris generally causes involuntary constriction or
dilation, respectively, of the pupil.                  When the same increase or
decrease in      illumination is      applied to a two-dimensional photograph
of an iris,       the pupil will not involuntarily constrict or dilate
like a live iris.            Thus,  a two-dimensional photograph used by an
imposter attempting to spoof an iris               based biometric authentication
system may be proven fraudulent.                  Consequently, it should be
understood that       controlling     illumination of biometric modality data
presented during authentication            facilitates     detecting illumination
characteristic differences that may be used to determine the
liveness of the user.
[00361          The HAC system 16 may also use differences in          illumination
characteristics        to determine the liveness of a user.            For example,
the HAC system 16 may determine the CICs and EICs of captured
biometric data,        and compare the CICs against the EICs to determine
whether they match.             When the CICs and the EICs match, a user is
determined to be live.             Alternatively, the HAC system 16 may
determine the difference between sequential CICs and the difference
between sequential EICs, and compare corresponding differences of
the CICs and EICs to ensure that            temporal changes of the CICs agree
with those of the EICs.             Thus, it should be understood that the
HAC system 16 may compare temporal changes in the CICs against

temporal changes in the EICs to ensure that temporal changes of
the CICs agree with those of the EICs.                         When the temporal changes
of the CICs agree with those of the EICs,                        a user is determined to
be live.          It should be appreciated that the HAC system 16 may
determine the illumination characteristics in any manner and may
compare the illumination characteristics in any manner that
facilitates determining the liveness of a user.
[0037]            The RA device 12,            the SP system 14          and the HAC system
16,   respectively,           each include a processor           (not shown)        and a memory
(not shown).           It should be understood that,                   as used herein, the
term processor is not limited to just those integrated circuits
referred to in the art as a processor, but broadly refers to a
computer,        an application        specific     integrated       circuit,      and any other
programmable circuit.               It   should be understood that               the processors
execute instructions,             or computer programs,          stored in       the respective
memories        (not shown) of the RA device 12,                  the SP system 14,             and
the HAC system 16.              The above examples are exemplary only,                      and are
thus not intended to limit                in    any way the definition           and/or meaning
of the term "processor."
[00381            The respective memories             (not shown)        in   the RA device 12,
the SP system 14,              and the HAC system 16 can be implemented using
any appropriate combination of alterable,                       volatile        or non-volatile
memory or non-alterable, or fixed, memory.                           The alterable memory,
whether volatile            or non-volatile,         can be implemented using any one
or more of static or dynamic RAM (Random Access Memory),                                 a floppy
disc and disc drive, a writeable or re-writeable optical disc and
disc drive, a hard drive, flash memory or the like.                                 Similarly,
the non-alterable             or fixed memory can be implemented using any one
or more of ROM (Read-Only Memory),                       PROM   (Programmable Read-Only
Memory),       EPROM     (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory),                         EEPROM
(Electrically         Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory),                        an optical
ROM disc, such as a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM disc, and disc drive or the
like.

[00391     Each of the memories       (not shown) can be a
computer-readable recording medium used to store data,
respectively, in the RA device        12,  the SP system 14,        and the HAC
system 16.   Moreover, each of the respective memories               (not shown)
can be a computer-readable      recording medium used to store          computer
programs or executable instructions that are executed,
respectively, by the RA device        12,  the SP system 14,        and the HAC
system 16.   Moreover, the memories        (not shown) may include smart
cards, SIMs or any other medium from which a computing device can
read computer programs or executable instructions.              As used herein,
the term "computer program" is      intended to encompass an executable
program that exists permanently or temporarily on any
computer-readable recordable medium that causes the computer or
computer processor to execute the program and thus causes the
computer to perform a function.        Applications as described herein
are computer programs.
[0040]     Figure 2 is a diagram illustrating a listing 26 of
exemplary illumination instructions 28          stored in the HAC system
16.  Any one of the illumination instructions           28,  or any combination
of the illumination instructions 28,          may be randomly selected by
the HAC system 16 to be executed while capturing biometric data
during authentication.       Varying the illumination intensity or
spectrum applied to a presented biometric modality over time while
generating a sequence of photographic images or a video sequence
facilitates determining the liveness of a user during
authentication.       Consequently, each of the illumination
instructions 28     is designed to vary the illumination applied to
a presented biometric modality, and may also be designed to vary
the applied illumination over time.
[0041]     The listing    26 includes a first    instruction      28 for varying
illumination over time that may be implemented by turning the at
least one illumination device on or off while taking the sequence

of photographic images,      or controlling      the at least        one illumination
device across a continuous range of intensities or different
wavelengths while taking the sequence of photographic images.                              For
example, the first instruction may be implemented by illuminating
presented biometric data using wavelengths corresponding to any
color in the visible spectrum such as, but not limited to,                               red,
blue, or green.       Alternatively, wavelengths corresponding to
illumination outside the visible            spectrum may be used such as,                  but
not limited to,      near infra-red light,          infra-red light, and
ultraviolet light.       It  should be appreciated that light outside
the visible spectrum could be captured by the RA device                            12 when
capturing biometric data without the user knowing that the light
has been projected on the presented biometric modality data.
 [0042]       Moreover, the listing 26 includes a second instruction
28    for causing the at least one illumination device to project a
detectable pattern     onto a presented biometric modality while taking
the sequence of photographic images.                The detectable pattern is
similar    to those projected by near infrared          illuminators           associated
with autofocus camera systems to assist            in  focusing the camera under
low light    conditions.    The detectable pattern           instruction           may also
cause the at least one illumination device to project any other
patterns, or sequences of patterns over time, while taking the
sequence of photographic images.              It should be appreciated that
projecting     a detectable pattern       onto a presented biometric modality
while capturing a sequence of photographic images facilitates
detecting curvature in an illuminated surface of the presented
biometric modality, which may be used to facilitate detecting the
liveness of a user at a remote location.
 [0043]       Furthermore,   the listing      26 includes a third            instruction
28    for varying the position of illumination with respect to the
presented biometric modality over time.               The third       instruction          may
include physically     moving the at least        one illumination device with
respect to the presented biometric modality while taking the

photographic images.                The third instruction may be repeatedly
implemented to generate a sequence of photographic images, each
taken with the at least one illumination device in a different
position.        Alternatively, the third instruction may include
activating, simultaneously or alternately, illumination devices
not included in the RA device 12,                 that are located at different
positions relative to the biometric modality while taking the
photographic images.              Moreover,   a camera attached to the RA device
12 may be moved independently of the RA device 12 to vary the
positions      of illumination with respect to the presented biometric
modality.
 [0044]        Additionally, the listing 26 includes a fourth
instruction 28         for altering the orientation of the presented
biometric modality.              Such an instruction is an indirect method of
changing the illumination of the biometric modality being captured,
as it alters the relative position of the biometric modality and
incidental sources            of ambient illumination that may be present
during authentication.                 For example, instructions that require
altering     an orientation          of a presented biometric modality over time
may require the user to alter his                 facial orientation in each
photographic image while biometric data of his face is                      captured
in a sequence of photographic images.                   Such facial orientations
include voluntary movements such as,                 but not limited to,       turning
the head to the right, turning the head to the left,                      looking up,
and looking down.          Alternatively,      the fourth instruction     may require
altering the orientation of the presented biometric modality by
moving the presented biometric modality data relative to the at
least     one illumination device.           For example,  the presented biometric
modality data may be moved from a first              to a second position    relative
to the at least one illumination device.
 [0045]        It should be understood that while altering the
orientation of the presented biometric modality movement of an
illuminated region on the presented biometric modality may be

tracked.     The behavior of the illuminated region on a
three-dimensional moving object is different than the behavior on
a two-dimensional moving object.              In addition, the behavior of an
illumination region on a human body will be different than the
behavior on an artificial        model constructed of different          materials.
  Consequently, instructions which alter the orientation of the
presented biometric modality facilitate detecting liveness of a
user at a remote location.
 [0046]      The    listing 26 also includes a fifth instruction that
requires altering the configuration of the presented biometric
modality over time.       The fifth instruction      is also an indirect    method
of changing the illumination of the biometric modality being
captured because it requires altering the presented biometric
modality data over time.          For example, the fifth instruction may
require a user to alter a facial expression in each photographic
image while biometric data of his              face is captured in a sequence
of photographic images.          Such facial expressions include, but are
not limited to,       frowning, smiling, and winking an eye.
Alternatively, when fingerprints are the biometric modality to be
used for authentication, the fifth instruction might require the
user to alter the configuration of fingerprints by requiring the
user to submit specific       fingers,   such as the middle and index fingers
of the right hand, for capture during authentication.                    Moreover,
the fifth instruction might require the user to alter the
presentation of the fingers by spreading or joining some or all
of the fingers.
 [0047]      The    first, second, and third instructions are referred
to herein as direct instructions, and the fourth and fifth
instructions are referred to herein as indirect instructions.
Direct instructions        are illumination instructions        executed by the
RA device 12 while biometric authentication data is captured with
the RA device 12.         Indirect instructions are illumination
instructions      communicated to the user by the RA device 12 that             are

expected to be executed by the user while biometric data is                 captured
with the RA device 12.               Direct instructions are considered to
implement direct            control of illumination by the HAC system 16,         while
indirect       instructions       are considered to implement indirect        control
by the HAC system 16 because they depend on the user to orient or
configure the presented biometric modality data while capturing
biometric data.
 [0048]           It should be understood that each of the illumination
instructions           28 may be repeatedly executed,       or may be executed in
combination with any other illumination instruction 28                    during
authentication            to generate a sequence of photographic images.            For
example, the at least one illumination device may be repeatedly
repositioned during authentication such that the position of the
at least one illumination device with respect to the presented
biometric modality varies over time, while the at least one
illumination device is on in some positions and off in other
positions.         As described herein, each of the sequence of photographic
images is        captured while executing at least one illumination
instruction          28.    Although the listing    26 includes five illumination
instructions, any number of illumination instructions may
alternatively be included in the listing 26.
 [0049]           Figure 3 is a diagram 30 illustrating EICs 32-1 to 32-4
and corresponding CICs              34-1 to 34-4 for a sequence of four
photographic images captured over time during authentication.
Corresponding illumination characteristics of each photographic
image may be compared to determine the liveness of a user.                         For
example,       the EIC 32-1 for a first        photographic image may be compared
against the CIC 34-1 of the first photographic image.                     When a
difference between the corresponding illumination characteristics
32-1 and 34-1 is within an acceptable tolerance,                  the EIC 32-1 is
considered to match the CIC               34-1.   When the corresponding
illumination for each image               in the sequence matches within an
acceptable tolerance the user is determined to be live.

Alternatively the corresponding illumination characteristics CIC,
EIC of any number of images may be required to match in order to
determine that a user is            live.     For example, the corresponding
illumination characteristics CIC,                EIC of three out of four images
may be required to match within the expected tolerance to determine
that a user is       live.
 [00501       As yet another alternative             for determining whether a user
is    live, matching scores generated as a result of comparing the
corresponding illumination characteristics for all of the images
may be combined into a single cumulative matching score for
comparison against an overall threshold score.                         When the     single
cumulative matching score is            at least      equal to the threshold score,
the user is    determined to be live.             In   view of the above,       it   should
be understood that the corresponding illumination characteristics
CIC,    EIC may be manipulated in any manner or scheme, and that any
summarizing technique may be used to determine the liveness of a
user.     Although a sequence of four photographic                   images is     included
in   the diagram 30,     the sequence may alternatively               include any number
of photographic images.
 [0051]       The   information shown in Figure 4 includes the same
information shown in Figure 3, as described in more detail below.
  As   such, information illustrated in Figure 4 that is                      identical
to information illustrated           in  Figure 3 is      identified      using the same
reference numerals used in Figure 3.
 [0052]       Figure 4 is a diagram 36 illustrating the EICs 32-1 to
32-4 and corresponding CICs 34-1 to 34-4 for the sequence of four
photographic images captured over time during authentication.                           This
diagram 36 is    similar    to that    shown in    Figure 3.       However,  differences
between sequential EICs 32-1 to 32-4,                   and differences between
sequential CICs 34-1 to 34-4 are included.                      Specifically, a first
expected difference 38-1 is            determined between EICs 32-1 and 32-2,
a second expected difference 38-2 is determined between EICs 32-2

and 32-3,     and a third   expected difference 38-3 is      determined between
EICs     32-3 and 32-4.      Moreover, a first captured difference 40-1
is determined between CICs 34-1 and 34-2,             a second captured
difference 40-2 is determined between CICs               34-2 and 34-3, and a
third     captured difference      40-3 is  determined between CICs 34-3 and
34-4.      The first 38-1,       second 38-2,  and third 38-3 expected
differences correspond to the first          40-1, second 40-2,    and the third
40-3 captured differences.           Corresponding differences are compared
to ensure that      temporal changes of the CICs 34-1 to 34-4 agree with
those of the EICs 32-1 to 32-4,            respectively.      For example, the
second expected difference 38-2 may be compared against the second
captured difference 40-2 to determine whether the difference between
them is    within an acceptable tolerance.        When the difference between
the differences 38-2 and 40-2 is within the acceptable tolerance,
illumination characteristics are determined to match.                 When all
of the corresponding differences match the user being authenticated
is determined to be a live user.
 [00531        Alternatively, any number of the expected differences
38-1 to 38-3 may be compared against corresponding captured
differences 40-1 to 40-3 to determine that a user is                live.    For
example,     three out of four corresponding differences may be required
to match within the expected tolerance to determine that a user
is    live.    As another alternative for determining whether a user
is    live, matching scores generated as a result of comparing any
number of corresponding differences may be combined into one
cumulative matching score and compared against an overall difference
threshold score.         When the one cumulative matching score is      at least
equal to the overall difference threshold score,                the user is
determined to be live.         In view of the above,  it   should be understood
that    the corresponding differences may be manipulated in           any manner
or scheme, and that any summarizing technique may be used to
determine that a user is           live.

 [0054]         Figure 5 is a flowchart 42 illustrating an exemplary
process used by the AC system 10                 for verifying the validity of
biometric data of a user requesting to conduct a network-based
transaction       that    requires accessing at least          one resource controlled
by the SP system 14 from a remote location.                       For the AC system 10
the process starts           44 with a user of the RA device              12 requesting
46 to remotely conduct a transaction that requires accessing at
least one resource controlled by the SP system 14.                         In response,
the SP system 14 continues processing by transmitting an
authentication request message to the HAC system 16.                         The
authentication request message includes at least the service
provider user identifier of the requesting user.                         Next, the HAC
system 16 continues processing by determining 48                        a biometric
modality to be captured during authentication, randomly selecting
48 at least one illumination instruction for capturing biometric
data during authentication,               generating 48 a capture request message
that includes at least the determined biometric modality and the
selected at least one illumination instruction, and transmitting
48 the capture request message to the RA device 12.                        The selected
at least      one illumination instruction            may include one or more direct
instructions,          one or more indirect      instructions,       or any combination
of direct      and indirect     instructions.          It   should be appreciated that
by virtue of randomly selecting the at least one illumination
instruction to be executed while capturing biometric data from a
user with the RA device 12,               the HAC system 16 continues processing
by directing illumination of the biometric data while capturing
the biometric data from a user.
 [00551         After receiving the capture request message,               the RAdevice
12 continues by displaying the biometric modality to be captured
on the screen 22,           and by notifying the user of any indirect
instructions included in the selected at least one illumination
instruction.          In  the exemplary embodiment the RA device 12 notifies
the user of any indirect instructions by displaying them on the
screen 22 for the user to see.                Next,   the requesting user continues

by reading the screen 22          and capturing biometric data 50
corresponding to the determined biometric modality with the RA
device 12.       When indirect instructions are also displayed on the
screen 22,      the user captures the biometric data while executing
the indirect instructions.
 [00561       It  should be understood that      in   the exemplary embodiment
biometric data is       captured as a plurality     of sequential photographic
images, and that as the user captures the biometric data with the
RA device 12 the user executes the indirect instructions included
in the selected at least one illumination instruction and the
security   application       causes the RA device 12 to execute the direct
instructions included in the selected at least one illumination
instruction.         Thus, biometric data of the determined biometric
modality is captured in accordance with the selected at least one
illumination instruction.           Each of the sequential photographic
images included in        the captured biometric data includes a captured
biometric data component and captured illumination characteristics
superimposed thereon.           It should be appreciated that each of the
captured biometric data components and each of the captured
illumination characteristics         can be varied over time such that    each
image in the sequence has different illumination characteristics.
  Next, the RA device         12 continues processing by transmitting the
captured biometric data to the HAC system 16.
 [0057]       After receiving the captured biometric data, the HAC
system 16 continues processing by determining whether the requesting
user is  a live    user 52 by comparing the illumination characteristics
 (CICs) of the captured biometric data against the illumination
characteristics         (EICs) expected to result from directing the
illumination of the biometric data.             More specifically, the HAC
system 16 continues by determining the first 38-1,               second 38-2,
and third 38-3 expected differences, and separating the captured
biometric data component from the CICs in each photographic image
to determine the first 40-1, second 40-2, and third 40-3 captured

differences.      After determining the expected and captured
differences, the HAC system 16 continues by comparing the first
expected difference 38-1 against the first         captured difference 40-1,
the second expected difference 38-2 against the second captured
difference 40-2,     and the third expected difference 38-3 against
the third captured difference 40-3.            When the result of each
comparison is    determined to constitute       a match,  the requesting user
is  determined to be a live   user.     When the result    of each comparison
does not constitute a match, the requesting user is determined to
be an imposter and the HAC system 16 continues processing by
transmitting a message 54 to the SP system 14 indicating the user
is an imposter and is not authenticated.             Next, processing ends
56.
 [00581      After determining that       the requesting user is   a live user
52,    the HAC system 16 continues processing by authenticating the
requesting user 58 by comparing the enrollment biometric data of
the requesting user against each of the captured biometric data
components.     When the enrollment biometric data matches each of
the captured biometric data components,            the requesting user is
successfully authenticated 58.
 [00591      After successfully authenticating the requesting user
58,   the HAC system 16 continues processing by transmitting         a message
60 to the SP system 14      indicating the requesting user has been
successfully    authenticated.   In response,      the SP system 14 continues
by determining whether the requesting user is authorized 62 to
conduct the requested transaction.            When the requesting user is
authorized,    processing continues by permitting the user to conduct
the transaction 64.      Next, processing ends 56.          However, when the
enrollment biometric data does not match each of the captured
biometric data components the requesting user is not successfully
authenticated 58,     and the HAC system 16 continues processing by
transmitting a message 54 to the SP system 14 indicating that the

requesting user has not been authenticated.                       Next,  processing ends
56.
 [00601         Because the selected at least one illumination
instruction is           executed in response to a communication from the
HAC system 16,         the HAC system 16 directsapplication              of the selected
at least      one illumination instruction              in    the exemplary embodiment.
  Thus, the process of verifying the validity of biometric data
described in        the exemplary embodiment is               a method of verifying      the
validity      of biometric data using host-directed                 illumination,    where
the HAC system 16 is              the host directing       illumination of a presented
biometric modality through the selected at least one illumination
instruction.           Moreover, because the selected at least one
illumination instruction may be executed by the RA device 12 in
response to the communication from the HAC system 16,                      the HAC system
16 effectively directs the RA device 12 to illuminate biometric
modality data presented during authentication.
 [0061]         Although the HAC system 16 determines the liveness of
a requesting user based on expected differences 38-1,                          38-2,   38-3
and captured differences 40-1,                  40-2,   40-3 in the exemplary
embodiment,       in    other embodiments the liveness of a requesting user
may be determined in any manner that facilitates determining the
liveness of a user including, but not limited to, based on direct
comparisons of the EICs 32-1,              32-2,     32-3 against corresponding CICs
34-1,      34-2,   34-3.
 [0062]         Although the requesting user is biometrically
authenticated in the exemplary embodiment when the enrollment
biometric data matches each of the captured biometric data
components,       in    other embodiments the enrollment biometric data need
not match each of the captured biometric data components to
successfully         authenticate       the requesting user.          For example,   three
of four captured biometric data components may be required to match
the enrollment biometric data and successfully authenticate the

requesting user.     Moreover, in such other embodiments any method
may be used to biometrically authenticate users that             is based on
the enrollment biometric data and the captured biometric data
components.
 [00631      Although the RA device 12 notifies      the user of any indirect
instructions included in the selected at least one illumination
instruction by displaying the indirect instructions on the screen
22 in   the exemplary embodiment,   in other embodiments the RA device
12 may notify the user of the indirect instructions in any manner
including, but not limited to,      voice instructions.         Moreover,
although the HAC system 16 transmits a capture request message
including the selected at least one illumination instruction to
the RA device 12 in    the exemplary embodiment,        in other embodiments
the HAC system 16 may transmit a plurality         of capture requests each
including one illumination instruction to be executed while
capturing a corresponding one of the photographic images included
in  the sequence of photographic images.        In  such other embodiments,
the HAC system 16 transmits each of the capture requests prior to
capturing the corresponding one of the photographic images.
 [0064]      Although the SP system 14 determines whether the
requesting user is    authorized to conduct the requested transaction
after the user is successfully biometrically authenticated in the
exemplary embodiment, in other embodiments the SP system 14 may
make this determination before transmitting the authentication
request message to the HAC system 16.           In yet other embodiments,
the HAC system 16 may determine whether the authenticated user is
authorized to conduct the requested transaction instead of the SP
system 14.
 [00651      Although the RA device 12 receives and executes the
selected at least one illumination instruction in the exemplary
embodiment, in alternative embodiments the RA device 12 may not
execute the selected at least one illumination instruction.

Instead, any device different than the RA device that is capable
of receiving and executing the selected at least one illumination
instruction may receive and execute the selected at least one
illumination instruction.           Such different    devices include,     but are
not limited to,          lamps.
[00661          Although the exemplary embodiment describes verifying
the validity of biometric data of a user using the RA device                   12
at a location remote from the SP system 14 and the HAC system 16,
in other embodiments the user may be located in close proximity
to at least one of the SP system 14 and the HAC system 16.                    The
exemplary embodiment describes operations performed by, and
communications sent between, the RA device 12,                the SP system 14,
and the HAC system 16 that facilitate determining whether a user
should be permitted to conduct a requested transaction.                   In other
embodiments the operations may be performed,             and the communications
may be sent,        in any order that facilitates determining whether a
user should be permitted to conduct a requested transaction.
[0067]          The exemplary authentication        process  starts    when a user
of the RA device 12 requests to remotely conduct a transaction                that
requires accessing at least         one resource controlled       by the SP system
14.   However, it should be appreciated that in other embodiments
the authentication         process may start    when the user makes the request
from his home personal computer while in            possession of the RA device
12.   In such other embodiments the SP system 14 communicates with
the personal computer over a first communications channel and the
HAC system 16 communicates with the RA device over a second
communications channel different than the first communications
channel.      Thus,   in  such other embodiments out of band communications
may be conducted between the user's personal computer and the SP
system 14,       and the user's   RA device 14 and the HAC system 16.         Such
out of band communications facilitate              increasing the security of
network-based transactions.

 [00681          It should be understood that by virtue of providing
illumination instructions that are executed while capturing
biometric data during authentication,               the HAC system 16 is     enabled
to control and direct specific aspects of authentication in a
seemingly unpredictable manner to a user that              facilitate    determining
liveness of the user.            As a result of the unpredictable nature of
HAC system control, successful spoofing of authentication systems
is   facilitated to be reduced.
 [00691          The processes and systems         described herein facilitate
increasing the level of trust in biometric authentication
transaction results determined with biometric data captured at a
remote location, and are believed to be applicable to many different
businesses for reducing risks that transactions conducted as a
result of a successful authentication will be conducted
fraudulently.
 [0070]          In  each embodiment,     the above-described processes reduce
the risks that transactions will be conducted fraudulently, and
thus facilitate        enhancing security      of systems and resources involved
in  conducting such transactions.            In exemplary embodiments described
herein,       biometric data is     captured from a user at a remote location
in accordance with selected illumination instructions transmitted
from a host authentication computer system.                   Each of the selected
illumination instructions requires executing an action during
authentication that effects illumination characteristics of a
biometric modality presented for capture in a sequence of
photographic images.            The selected illumination instructions are
executed by at least          one of a remote authentication          device and the
user while the biometric data is captured by the user.                      The host
authentication computer system determines whether the captured
biometric data was captured from a live user by separating a
biometric data component from captured illumination characteristics
included in        each of the photographic images,      generating illumination
characteristics         for each photographic image expected to result           from

capturing the biometric data, and comparing the captured
illumination characteristics against the expected illumination
characteristics for each image.                          When the captured illumination
characteristics match the expected illumination characteristics
for each photographic image,                     the user is determined to be live.
The user is authenticated and after being determined to be an
authorized user is permitted to conduct a requested transaction.
 [0071]          Exemplary embodiments of authentication processes and
systems that provide rigorous liveness detection support are
described above in detail.                     The processes are not limited to use
with the specific computer system embodiments described herein,
but rather, the processes can be utilized independently and
separately from other processes described herein.                                   Moreover, the
invention is not limited to the embodiments of the processes and
systems described above in detail.                             Rather, other variations of
the processes may be utilized within the spirit and scope of the

specification         is  solely       for the purpose of providing a context for
the present invention.                 It   is   not to be taken as an admission that
any or all       of these matters form part                    of the prior     art   base or were
