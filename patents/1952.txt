contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

                                        FIELD OF THE ART
         [0002] The disclosure is in the field of friction reducing polymers and their use in
treating subterranean formations and sea water injection applications.
                                          BACKGROUND
         [0003] In the drilling, completion, and stimulation of oil and gas wells, well treatment
fluids are often pumped into well bore holes under high pressure and at high flow rates. As the
fluid is pumped through the system at high flow rates (thousands of GPM) there is a significant
amount of frictional resistance, which results in large energy requirements.
         [0004] In order to reduce the friction between the well treatment fluid and the bore
linings, friction pressure reducing additives have been combined with the treatment fluids and
added during pumping so as to reduce pump pressure. For example, a type of well treatment
commonly utilized for stimulating hydrocarbon production from a subterranean zone penetrated
by a well bore is hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing, also referred to as fracing (or
fracking), is used to initiate production in low-permeability reservoirs and re-stimulate
production in older producing wells. In hydraulic fracing, a fluid composition is injected into
the well at pressures effective to cause fractures in the surrounding rock formation. Fracing is
used both to open up fractures already present in the formation and create new fractures.
         [0005] Water soluble polymers can be used as friction reducers in well treatment fluids
to reduce the turbulent flow, and lower the energy loss in the fluid due to friction as the fluid is
pumped through the system. These types of treatments are often called "slick water treatments
or slick water fracs." Conventional polyacrylamide polymers provide efficient friction

acrylic acid or acrylamide monomers and ii) vinyl monomers selected from vinyl esters, vinyl
alcohols, and vinyl ethers, including hydrolyzed derivatives thereof. Exemplary polymers can
be used to provide reduction of friction-related          energy losses in hydraulic fracturing
applications.   The polymers include a significant fraction of reactive groups which can be
readily modified. The polymers can be minimally- or substantially-derivatized with various
functional groups to modify the physical properties as desired.
        [0009] As used herein, the terms "polymer," "polymers," "polymeric," and similar
terms are used in their ordinary sense as understood by one skilled in the art, and thus may be

recurring units. Polymers may be formed in various ways, including by polymerizing
monomers and/or by chemically modifying one or more recurring units of a precursor polymer.
A polymer may be a "copolymer" comprising two or more different recurring units formed by,
e.g., copolymerizing two or more different monomers, and/or by chemically modifying one or
more recurring units of a precursor polymer.

amount and type of monomers used, the amount and type of inhibitor used, and a number of
other factors known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiment, a suitable emulsion
polymerization technique may have an initiation temperature of about 250 C. Due to the
exothermic nature of the polymerization reaction, the mixture may be maintained at a higher
temperature than the initiation temperature during procession of the polymerization reaction,

         [0031] TREATMENT FLUID
         [0032] In exemplary embodiments, a treatment fluid, for example a well treatment
fluid, may comprise the friction reducing polymers described herein and water. In exemplary
embodiments, the treatment fluid can be used in any operation where friction reduction is
desired including but not limited to stimulation and completion operations, for example
hydraulic fracturing applications.
         [0033] In exemplary embodiments, a method for reducing friction in a well treatment
fluid comprises adding to the well treatment fluid a friction reducing polymer comprising two or
more recurring units wherein at least one recurring unit is an acrylic acid or acrylamide
monomer and at least one recurring unit is a vinyl monomer selected from a vinyl alcohol, a
vinyl ester, and a vinyl ether.
         [0034] In exemplary embodiments, the well treatment fluid is utilized in, or is a
component of a process for obtaining hydrocarbons from a subterranean well. In exemplary
embodiments, the process is stimulating hydrocarbon production from a subterranean zone
penetrated by a well bore. In exemplary embodiments, the process is hydraulic fracturing. In
exemplary embodiments, the process is sea water injection.
         [0035] In exemplary embodiments, the polymers can be included in the stimulation
fluids or aqueous treatment fluids in an amount sufficient to provide the desired reduction of
friction. In some embodiments, the polymer may be present in an amount in the range of from
about 0.1 to about 40 Gallons Per Thousand Gallons of the aqueous treatment fluid (GPTG). In
some embodiments, the polymer may be present in an amount in the range of from about 0.25
to about 2.5 GPTG of the aqueous treatment fluid.
         [0036] In exemplary embodiments, the polymers can be added to slick water
treatments at concentrations of 0.1 to 40 GPTG of stimulation fluid. In other embodiments, the

      WO 2014/146064                                                         PCT/US2014/030950
friction reducing polymer is added at a concentration of 0.25 to about 2.5 GPTG of stimulation
fluid.
         [0037] In these applications, the fracturing fluid, i.e., well treatment fluid, can be
configured as a gelled fluid, a foamed gel fluid, acidic fluids, water and potassium chloride
treatments, and the like. The fluid is injected at a pressure effective to create one or more
fractures in the subterranean formation. Depending on the type of well treatment fluid utilized,
various additives may also be added to the fracturing fluid to change the physical properties of
the fluid or to serve a certain beneficial function. Optionally, a propping agent such as sand or
other hard material is added which serves to keep the fractures open after the fracturing
operation. Also, fluid loss agents may be added to partially seal off the more porous sections of
the formation so that the fracturing occurs in the less porous strata. Other oilfield additives that
may also be added to the fracturing fluid include emulsion breakers, antifoams, scale inhibitors,
H2 S and or 02 scavengers,      crosslinking agents, surface tension reducers, breakers, buffers,
surfactants and non-emulsifiers, fluorocarbon surfactants, fluid loss additives, foamers,
temperature stabilizers, diverting agents, shale and clay stabilizers, paraffin/asphaltene
inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors, acids and biocides. For example, an acid may be included in the
aqueous treatment fluids, among other things, for a matrix or fracture acidizing treatment. In
fracturing embodiments, propping agent may be included in the treatment fluids to prevent the
fracture from closing when the hydraulic pressure is released.
         [0038] METHODS OF USE
         [0039] In exemplary embodiments, the polymers and treatment fluids described herein
may be used in any subterranean treatment where the reduction of friction is desired.
Exemplary subterranean treatments include, but are not limited to, drilling operations,
stimulation treatments, and completion operations. Those of ordinary skill in the art, with the
benefit of this disclosure, will be able to recognize a suitable subterranean treatment where
friction reduction may be desired.

formation is provided, comprising: adding a friction reducing polymer to a treatment fluid; and

introducing the treatment fluid into the portion of the subterranean formation; wherein the
friction reducing polymer comprises two or more recurring units wherein at least one recurring
unit is an acrylic acid or acrylamide monomer and at least one recurring unit is a vinyl
monomer selected from a vinyl alcohol, a vinyl ester, and vinyl ether. In some embodiments,
the treatment fluid is introduced into the portion of the subterranean formation at a rate and
pressure sufficient to create or enhance one or more fractures in the portion of the subterranean
formation. The portion of the subterranean formation that the treatment fluid is introduced will
vary dependent upon the particular subterranean treatment. For example, the portion of the
subterranean formation may be a section of a well bore, for example, in a well bore cleanup
operation. In the stimulation embodiments, the portion may be the portion of the subterranean
formation to be stimulated.

         [0042] Exemplary emulsion polymers were prepared as described below.
         [0043] The oil phase used for all samples was prepared by dissolving sorbitan
monooleate (20.8 g) in paraffin solvent (186.5 g).
         [0044] The separate aqueous phase for each sample was prepared by mixing acrylamide
(53% aqueous solution), acrylic acid (glacial), and vinyl acetate in the ratios described in Table
1 below, along with deionized water (165.0 g), and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (40%
solution, 0.6 g). Ammonia (29% aqueous solution) was added to adjust the pH of each of the
samples in the range of 6.0-6.5. The aqueous phase was added to the oil phase and
homogenized.
         [0045] Each sample emulsion was added to a 1 liter glass reactor, and sub-surface
sparged with nitrogen for 60 min. The polymerization was initiated by injecting t-butyl
hydroperoxide (3.0% solution, 0.2 g). Sulfur dioxide gas was supplied continuously while
maintaining a nitrogen blanket to control the reaction temperature under 40 C. After the
exotherm ceased, the reaction mixture was heated to 50 C and held for 1.5 h.

        [0047] Example 2. Friction Reduction Characteristics of Exemplary Polymers
        [0048] Exemplary samples 1-6 from Example 1, were tested in a friction loop apparatus
to characterize their friction reduction performance in tap water and brine.
        [0049] The friction loop is a laboratory instrument designed to simulate well fracturing
flow conditions. Fracturing in the field often requires pumping over 50 barrels per minute
through a ~4.5" bore which results in a highly turbulent flow (Reynolds number: 500,000 to
5,000,000). Although it is not possible to achieve this kind of flow in the lab, the friction loop
designed simulates the field conditions to the maximum known extent (Reynolds number:

         [0051] This water or brine was then re-circulated through the friction loop at a flow rate
of 24 gallons per minute across a five-foot section of half-inch diameter pipe (required to
generate the above mentioned Reynolds number). The baseline pressure drop was measured.
The polymer was now added (at a measured concentration of 0.5 gallons of polymer per
thousand gallons of water/brine or 0.5 GPTG) to the recirculating solution, where it inverted
and dissolved. The degree of friction reduction (%FRt) at a given time 't' was calculated from
the initial pressure drop APi and the pressure drop at time t, APt using the equation:
                   AP - AP
