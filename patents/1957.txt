Field of the Invention
[0001] The present invention relates to a support arrangement for supporting structures.
[0002] In particular, although not exclusive, this invention relates to a support arrangement
for supporting structures such as hoardings and panels.
[0003] The present invention also relates to a support-weight, a strengthening post, related
methods of use of the support-weight and/or strengthening post and hoarding and/or fencing
installations including a support-weight and/or a strengthening post.
Background of the Invention
[0004] Structures such as hoardings, panels often time need to be erected to form a "wall" or
"fence" at a construction site or renovation site to fence off areas in which construction or
renovation is being carried out. The structure is typically made of wood, wooden composites,
or plastics and is typically screwed to a support post. However, such an arrangement is not
always able to provide sufficient stability to the structure especially during windy conditions or
when the structure is pushed by people accidentally. Moreover, if the structures are temporary
installations, it is generally not possible to fix the support posts without making any
indentations on the ground.
[0005] It should be noted that although this present invention is described with reference to
supporting hoardings or panels used at a construction or renovation site, the present invention
can also be used to support structures such as billboards, advertisement boards, or screens,
etc., without departing from the scope of the present invention.

                                                 2
[0006] It is to be understood that, if any prior art information is referred to herein, such
reference does not constitute an admission that the information forms part of the common
general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other countries.
Summary of the Invention
[0007] According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a structure
support arrangement for supporting a structure, the structure support arrangement comprising
a body member, a nesting formation defined on the body member and configured to prevent
lateral movement of the structure support arrangement in at least one transverse direction
when the structure support arrangement is nested with a further structure support arrangement
and a post receiving formation defined on the body member and configured for receiving a
support post to support the structure. The nesting formation makes the structure support
arrangement    and the further structure support arrangement stackable and prevents
displacement between the structure support arrangement and the further structure support
arrangement in transverse directions.
[0008] Preferably, the post receiving formation is any one or more selected from an aperture
and a recess.
[0009] Preferably, the structure support arrangement defines at least one support side along
which the structure is supported in operation, and the post receiving formation is located
adjacent to the at least one support side.
[00010] Preferably, the structure support arrangement further comprises one or more plates
secured to the body member, in proximity of the post receiving formation, and adapted to
prevent lateral movement of the support post in at least one transverse direction when the
support post is received in the post receiving formation.
[00011] Preferably, the one or more plates comprise one plate secured to the body member
to at least partially cover an opening of the post receiving formation so as to prevent the
support post from laterally sliding out of the post receiving formation.
[00012] Preferably, the one or more plates comprise two plates secured to the body member,
such that a gap between the two plates, when secured to the body member, is smaller than
the opening of the post receiving formation.
[00013] Preferably, the one or more plates are at least partially embedded in the body member
when secured to the body member.
[00014] Preferably, the one or more plates are removably secured to the body member.

[00015] Preferably, the one or more plates are provided with holes adapted to receive one or
more fasteners in order to secure the one or more plates to the body member.
[00016] Preferably, the body member has threaded holes corresponding with the holes of the
one or more plates.
[00017] Preferably, the one or more plates comprise one plate, the one plate being a pivotable
latch adapted to pivot between an open position and a closed position, such that, in the open
position, the one plate enables the support post to move in and out of the post receiving
formation and in the closed position, the one plate prevents the support post from laterally
moving out of the post receiving formation.
[00018] Preferably, the body member has an embedded pin about which the one plate is
adapted to pivot.
[00019] Preferably, the one or more plates comprise one plate, the one plate being a slidable
latch adapted to slide between an open position and a closed position, such that, in the open
position, the one plate enables the support post to move in and out of the post receiving
formation and in the closed position, the one plate prevents the support post from laterally
moving out of the post receiving formation.
[00020] Preferably, the body member has a sliding cavity along which the one plate is adapted
to slide.
[00021] Preferably, a shape of the post receiving formation conforms to a cross-sectional
shape of the support post.
[00022] Preferably, the shape of the post receiving formation is rectangular.
[00023] Preferably, the structure support arrangement further comprises one or more dovetail
formations defined on the body member and configured for sliding engagement with one or
more dovetail formations on the further structure support arrangement in operation. The
dovetail formations provide additional restriction against the displacement of the structure
support arrangement in transverse directions.
[00024] Preferably, the structure support arrangement further comprises one or more pole
receiving apertures defined on the body member. The one or more pole receiving apertures
allow the structure support arrangement to be used as fence supports. Additionally, the one
or more pole receiving apertures allow a lever to be inserted through the structure support
arrangement, such that, a plurality of stacked structure support arrangements may be pivoted
to receive the support post.

support-weight receives a post of a first fencing panel into its first fencing post recess and a
post of a second fencing panel into its second adjacent fencing post recess.
[00080] Other aspects of the invention are also disclosed.
[00081]         It will be apparent to the skilled person in the art that one or more of the
abovementioned aspects of the invention provide one or more of the following advantages
over the prior art:
(i)     The post receiving formation defined by the body of the support-weight can directly
receive a hoarding panel support post to which a hoarding panel is securable. This provides
the advantage of avoiding any separate connector, extension, or other means to receive the
panel support post which is outside the form of the weight and which may enlarge the footprint
made by the combination of the weight and hoarding panel support post. Space for workers
to operate behind a hoarding panel may be limited, so a small footprint is of great importance.
(ii)    A small footprint of the support-weight also results from: (i) the strengthening post
being directly receivable by the support-weight; and/or (ii) the shape of the support-weight in
a non-rectangular form with a wider central section (in plan view) permitting the mass of a
stack of nestable support-weights to be located closer towards the hoarding panel so the
weight extend less into the working space behind the hoarding than would be the case for

                                                10
comparable rectangular plan view shaped support-weight; and/or the nestability of the
support-weights themselves.
(iii)   The invention has fewer interoperating parts than other systems in the prior art. For a
hoarding installation the invention requires only three components separate from the hoarding
panel, and for a fencing installation the invention requires only one component separate from
the fencing panel.
(iv)    The invention provides for easy stacking of the support-weights using handle
formations so that a support-weight can be picked up and put down without trapping the
operator's fingers. Angled corners also allow the weights to be safely stacked on pallets,
where abutting stacks of weights would again inhibit the operator's ability to safely handle the
weights. The weights are also adapted to be a convenient size and weight for lifting. Other
advantages due to the size and shape of the weights are gained in that fewer weights
(compared with prior art systems) are required to be used in conjunction with the strengthening
post to achieve certification of relevant industry standards. See, for example, Australian
Standards AS4687-2007 - "Temporary Fencing and Hoardings" and AS1170.2-2011
"Structural design actions - Wind actions".
(v)     Use of the strengthening support post raises the fulcrum point of a hoarding installation
so that it is higher than it would be without the use of the support post. This means that
collapsing of the hoarding installation is inhibited when subject to forces against a hoarding
panel.
(vi)    The orientation of a panel support post having a rectangular cross-section such that
the wider dimension of the panel support post is perpendicular to the near edge of the support
weight. This orientation is different to the prior art in which has the wider dimension of the
panel support post run parallel with the near edge of the support-weight. This provides
substantial strength gains, as the forces on the panel support post are concentrated about the
deep axis of the post (for example, in a commonly available shaped post, approximately 90
mm deep) instead of the shallow axis of the stud (for example, in a commonly available shaped
post, approximately 45 mm deep).
(vii)   The invention is able to used with panel support posts of a standard size (for example,
a "2x4" which is approximately 40 mm x 90 mm) and meet the relevant industry standards.
The invention is able to be used with standard grade panel support posts (for example, a
MPG10 grade timber stud).
(viii)  Where a system is not braced (for example, by attachment to a wall or ceiling) lateral,
post installation movement or "snaking" could occur. To avoid this, the invention contemplates
use of a horizontal bar received into a complementary recess in the uppermost support-weight

                                                    11
of a hoarding installation. The horizontal bar may also be affixed to one or more panel support
posts (for example, by means of affixing means (such as a screw) between the panel support
post and the horizontal bar and/or the hoarding panel.
(ix)     The invention provides the user the ability to install a pre-certified and structural
engineer approved counter-weight solution. The user is able to follow a simple process and
ensure that the panels are secure, and the system is safe.
(x)      Once a hoarding installation is complete, the weights cannot be removed without first
removing the panels (which are the area of risk if impacted). By comparison in the prior art
which uses an upright stand, the weights can be added and removed without removing the
panel and this is not tamperproof, but since the panels of a hoarding installation in accordance
with invention may screwed into the panel support post (in the space between the plates),
once the panel is secured to the panel support posts, the support-weights cannot be removed
until after the screws affixing the hoarding are removed, and (by extension) the hoarding panel
itself.

 Description of Embodiments
[00099]           It should be noted in the following description that like or the same reference
numerals in different embodiments denote the same or similar features.

                                                    13
[000100]        Fig. 1 illustrates a plurality of structure support arrangements 1210, 1220 1230,
1240, 1250, and 1260 stacked along a support post 110 in accordance with a preferred
embodiment 100 of the present invention. At a construction site or shop renovation site,
multiple stacks of the structure support arrangements are placed along the boundary of the
site. One or more hoardings or panels are fixed to the support posts 110. This way, a wall or
a fence is formed along the boundary of the site to for example prevent pedestrians from
entering into this site. A structure support arrangement is also herein referred to as a support
weight.
[000101]        Fig. 2, illustrates a top perspective view of a structure support arrangement
1220 of the plurality of structure support arrangements 1210 to 1260, in accordance with a
preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 2, the structure support
arrangement 1220 comprises a body member 210. In one embodiment of the invention, the
body member 210 is made of plastic. Further, in one embodiment, body member 210 is made
using a technique selected from a group of technologies including injection moulding, rotary
moulding and blow moulding.
[000102]        Further, the structure support arrangement 1220 includes a nesting formation
220 defined on the body member 210. The nesting formation 220 is configured to prevent
lateral movement of the structure support arrangement 1220 in at least one transverse
direction when the structure support arrangement 1220 is nested with a further structure
support arrangement, particularly, an adjacent similar structure support arrangement 1210 or
1230.
[000103]        The transverse direction is a direction defined by x and y directions (as
indicated by the x and y arrows in Fig. 3) and is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of
the support post 110 in operation. For example, a transverse direction that is substantially in
x and y plane can be defined by a linear combination of x and y directions.
[000104]        Fig. 3 illustrates the nesting formation 220 in accordance with a preferred
embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 3, the nesting formation 220 comprises
an I-shaped projection 2210 and an -shaped cavity 2220. The I-shaped projection 2210 has
one or more projection heads 2212 and a projection neck 2214 connecting therebetween.
[000105]        Fig. 4 illustrates a bottom           perspective view of the structure   support
arrangement 1220 in accordance with a preferred embodiment 400 of the present invention.
As shown in Fig. 4, the I-shaped cavity 2220 has one or more cavity heads 2222 and a cavity
neck 2224.
[000106]        If the structure support arrangement 1220 is nested with the adjacent similar
structure support arrangement 1210, the two projection heads 2212 of the structure support

                                                 14
arrangement 1220 mate with the two cavity heads 2222 of the adjacent similar structure
support arrangement 1210. Further, the projection neck 2214 of the structure support
arrangement 1220 mates with the cavity neck 2224 of the adjacent similar structure support
arrangement 1210. The adjacent similar structure support arrangement 1210 is installed on
the top of the structure support arrangement 1220. As a result, the lateral movement of the
structure support arrangements 1210 and 1220 relative to each other in at least one transverse
direction can be prevented.
[000107]        On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 1, the one or more cavity heads 2222 and
cavity neck 2224 of the structure support arrangement 1220 mate with the corresponding one
or more projection heads 2212 and projection neck 2214 of the structure support arrangement
1230, which is installed under the structure support arrangement 1220. As a result, the lateral
movement of the structure support arrangements 1220 and 1230 relative to each other in at
least one transverse direction can be prevented.
[000108]        Returning now to Fig. 2, the structure support arrangement 1220 further
comprises a post receiving formation 230 defined on the body member 210. The post receiving
formation 230 is configured for receiving the support post 110. In one embodiment, the post
receiving formation 230 is any one or more selected from an aperture and a recess. The post
receiving formation 230 includes an opening formed on a side (particularly, the support side
510, as shown in Fig. 5) of the structure support arrangement 1220. Further, in one
embodiment, a shape of the post receiving formation 230 conforms to a cross-sectional shape
of the support post 110 in order for the support post 110 to fit into the post receiving formation
230. In another embodiment, the shape of the post receiving formation is rectangular
regardless of the cross-sectional shape of the support post 110.
[000109]        In one embodiment, the structure support arrangement 1220 comprises one or
more plates (i.e., lip plates) 240 secured to the body member 210, in proximity of the post
receiving formation 230. Further, the one or more lip plates 240 are adapted to prevent lateral
movement of the support post 110 in at least one transverse direction when the support post
110 is received in the post receiving formation 230.
[000110]        In one embodiment, one lip plate is secured to the body member 210 to entirely
or partially cover the opening of the post receiving formation 230 so as to prevent the support
post 110 from laterally sliding out of the post receiving formation 230 in at least one transverse
direction.
[000111]        In one embodiment in which two lip plates are used, a gap between the two lip
plates 240, when secured to the body member 210, is smaller than the opening of the post
receiving formation 230, as shown in Fig. 2. Thus, when the support post 110 is received in

                                                 15
the post receiving formation 230, the one or more lip plates prevent the support post 110 from
laterally sliding out of the post receiving formation 230 in at least one transverse direction.
[000112]         In one embodiment of the invention, the one or more lip plates 240 are
removably secured to the body member 210, such as by means of one or more fasteners.
Further, the one or more lip plates 240 are provided with holes adapted to receive the one or
more fasteners in order to secure the one or more lip plates 240 to the body member 210.
Accordingly, the body member 210 has threaded holes corresponding with the holes of the
one or more lip plates 240.
[000113]         In another embodiment, the one or more lip plates 240 are at least partially
embedded in the body member 210 when secured to the body member 210.
[000114]         In another embodiment, the one lip plate 240 is a pivotable latch adapted to
pivot between an open position and a closed position. In the open position, the lip plate 240
enables the support post 110 to move in and out of the post receiving formation 230. In the
closed position, the one lip plate 240 prevents the support post 110 from laterally moving out
of the post receiving formation 230 in at least one transverse direction. Accordingly, the body
member 210 has an embedded pin about which the one lip plate 240 is adapted to pivot. In
yet another embodiment, the one lip plate 240 is a slidable latch adapted to slide between the
open position and the closed position. Accordingly, the body member 210 has a sliding cavity
along which the one lip plate 240 is adapted to slide.
[000115]         In one embodiment, the structure support arrangement 1220 further comprises
one or more dovetail formations 250 defined on the body member 210. Further, the one or
more dovetail formations 250 are configured for sliding engagement with one or more dovetail
formations on the adjacent similar structure support arrangement 1210 in operation. In one
embodiment, the one or more dovetail formations 250 comprise respective one or more
dovetail projections 2510 (shown in Fig. 4) and respective one or more dovetail cavities 2520
(shown in Fig. 2). In sliding engagement, the one or more dovetail projections of the adjacent
similar structure support arrangement 1210 mate with the one or more dovetail cavities 2520
of the structure support arrangement 1220. The one or more dovetail formations 250 provide
additional restriction to the structure support arrangement 1220 against lateral movements in
at least one transverse direction.
[000116]         In one embodiment, the structure support arrangement 1220 further comprises
one or more pole receiving apertures 260 defined on the body member 210. In one
embodiment, the one or more pole receiving apertures 260 are configured to receive poles.
The pole can be part of a structure such as a web with poles at the edges of the web. The
pole at one edge of the web is received into the pole receiving aperture 260 of the structure

                                                  16
support arrangement 1220, and the pole at another edge of the web is received into the pole
receiving aperture of another structure support arrangement. When the web is erected, the
two structure support arrangements servers as the bases of the web and keep the web upright.
[000117]         Referring to Figs 8 and 9 there is illustrated an embodiment of the strength
enhancing structure 102 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The
strength enhancing structure 102 comprises a main body 104 having a first end 1042 and a
second end 1044. The main body 104 may have for example a circular cross-section, a
rectangular cross-section or a trapezoidal cross-section. In one embodiment, the main body
104 has a straight profile throughout the length of the main body 104. In another embodiment,
the main body 104 may have one or more bends at a predetermined angle and at a
predetermined distance from the first end 1042 or the second end 1044. In one embodiment,
the main body 104 has an L-shaped profile. Also, the main body 104 may have an arc-like
profile. The arcs and other bends are provided to the main body 104 in order to provide
additional rigidity to the main body 104 against buckling or other failures due to localized stress
concentration.
[000118]         Further, the main body 104 may be made of, but not limited to, a wood, metal,
an alloy or a rigid material having sufficient compressive and/or tensile strength, depending
upon the material used for making the first part 105 and the second part 110 of the structure
support arrangement 100. Also, the main body 104 may be a solid or a hollow component.
Making the main body 104 hollow provides weight reduction and avoid material wastage. In
that manner, it is envisaged that the material chosen for the hollow main body 104 will have
sufficient strength to withstand the stresses generated during operation.
[000119]         A first connection mechanism 106 is provided at the first end 1042 of the main
body 104. The first connection mechanism 106 is configured to connect the first end 1042 of
the main body 104 of the strength enhancing structure 102 to the body member 210 of the
counterweight 1210, i.e., the first part 105 of the structure support arrangement 100. In various
embodiments, first connection mechanism 106 comprises a first connection plate 1062
extending from the first end 1042 of the main body 104. Also, at least one connection bar 1064
extends from the first connection plate 1062. In one embodiment, the at least one connection
bar 1064 includes two connection bars 1064. The at least one connection bar 1064 is
configured to be securely inserted to the cavity 260 of the body member 210. It is envisaged
here that a dovetail joint may be provided between the at least one connection bar 1064 and
the cavity 260, to ensure that the at least one connection bar 1064 is secured within the cavity
260. Further, it is envisaged that the cross section of the at least one connection bar 1064 is
adapted to conform to the shape of the cavity 260. This secures the first connection

                                                 17
mechanism 106 and thereby, the first end 1042 of the main body 104, in the body member
210.
[000120]        In various other embodiments, the first connection mechanism 106 includes a
first clamping arrangement configured to clamp the first end 1042 to the first part (or the
counterweigh 1210 here). In yet another embodiment, the first connection mechanism 106
includes a first snap fit arrangement having a first spring loaded chuck configured to receive
the first end 1042. In one embodiment, the first connection plate 1062 of the first connection
mechanism 106 has at least one first hole. The at least one first hole may be internally
threaded. Also, the at least one first hole is configured to receive the at least one first fastener
and prevent the movement of the first connection plate 1062 and thereby the movement of the
strength enhancing structure 102, with respect to the first part 105 and the second part 110.
In various embodiments, the at least one first fastener may include any one of a screw, a bolt,
a nut and bolt combination, a stud and many other variations as would be appreciated by a
skilled addressee.
[000121]        The strength enhancing structure 102 also includes a second connection
mechanism 108 at the second end 1044 of the main body 104. The second connection
mechanism 108 is configured to connect the second end 1044 of the main body 104 to the
second part 110 (or the support post 110) of the structure support arrangement 100. In various
embodiments, the second connection mechanism 108 further comprises a second connection
plate 1082 extending from the second end 1042 of the main body 104. And the second
connection plate 1082 has at least one second hole 1084 extending through the second
connection plate 1082. The second connection mechanism 108 also includes at least one
second fastener. In various embodiments, the at least one second fastener may include any
one of a screw, a bolt, a nut and bolt combination, a stud and many other variations as would
be appreciated by a skilled addressee.
[000122]        The at least one second hole is configured to receive the at least one second
fastener to securely connect the second connection mechanism 108 to the second part 110
(or the support post 110) of the structure support arrangement 100 through the at least one
second hole 1084. In various other embodiments, the second connection mechanism 108
includes a second clamping arrangement configured to clamp the second end 1044 to the
second part 110 of the structure support arrangement 100. In yet another embodiment, the
second connection mechanism 108 embodies a second snap fit arrangement having a second
spring loaded chuck configured to receive the second end 1044. Also, a cut-out 1086 is
provided in the second connection plate 1082.

                                                 18
[000123]        The first connection mechanism 106 and the second connection mechanism
 108 are adapted to prevent motion of the strength enhancing structure 102 with respect to the
first part 105 and the second part 110 of the structure support arrangement 100. The strength
enhancing structure 102 is adapted to provide additional strength to the second part 110 (or
the support post 110) via the main body 104.
[000124]        In one embodiment, the strength enhancing structure 102 is removably
attached to the body member 210 and the support post 110. The at least one connection bar
 1064 of the first connection mechanism 106 may form detachable link with the cavity 260
having a press-fit locking and unlocking mechanism. And the second connection mechanism
 108 may be detached from the support post 110 by unfastening the at least one second
fastener on the second connection plate 1082.
[000125]        As can be seen from the above description, the second part 110 of the structure
support arrangement 100 is provided with additional strength by connecting the first end 1042
of the main body 104 of the strength enhancing structure 102 to the first part 1020 of the
structure support arrangement 100 and connecting the second end 1044 of the main body 104
of the strength enhancing structure 102 to the second part 110 of the structure support
arrangement 100. This way, the strength enhancing structure 102 increases the strength of
the support post 110 and the stability of the structure support arrangement 100 when
supporting heavier panels or hoardings fixed to the second post 110 and in different weather
conditions.
[000126]        It should also be noted that the structure support arrangement 100 described
in the present disclosure is just an example of a structure support arrangement the strength
of which the strength enhancing structure 102 can be used to enhance and is not limited to
the configuration described in the present disclosure. That is, the structure support
arrangement 100 can be configured in other ways. For example, the structure support
arrangement 100 can simply include a base (i.e., the first part) and a support post (i.e., the
second part) extending from the base to support a hoarding or a panel.
[000127]        In one embodiment, the structure support arrangement 1220 further comprises
one or more handle formations 270 defined on the body member 210. Further, the one or more
handle formations 270 are configured to facilitate stacking of the structure support
arrangement 1220 with the adjacent similar structure support arrangement 1210 or 1230 in
operation. Fig. 5 illustrates the structure support arrangement 1220 in accordance with another
preferred embodiment 500 of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 5, the structure support
arrangement 1220 defines at least one support side 510 and at least one non-support side

                                                      19
520. Further, the structure is supported along the at least one support side 510 in operation.
Also, the post receiving formation 230 is located adjacent to the at least one support side 510.
[000128]         Also, the one or more pole receiving apertures 260 are located towards an edge
540 of the structure support arrangement 1210. In one embodiment, the edge 540 is located
at the at least one non-support side 520. Also, in one embodiment, the body member 210 is a
hollow member. The hollow member 210 is filled with a coagulable material, such as cement.
The coagulable material provides a sufficient weight to the structure support arrangement.
This provides the structure support arrangement with further stability. A filling aperture 530 is
provided at the hollow member 210 at the at least one non-support side 520. The coagulable
material is filled into the body member 210 through the filling aperture 530.
[000129]         As shown in Fig. 1, multiple structure support arrangements 1210 to 1260 are
stacked to form a stack of structure support arrangements 1210 to 1260. Multiple stacks of
structure support arrangements are placed along the boundary of a site, for example, a
construction site or a shop renovation site. The structures, for example, hoardings or panels,
are fixed to the support posts 110. Thus, a wall or fence along the boundary of the site is
formed to for example prevent pedestrians from entering into this site.
[000130]          However, due to external forces caused by for example storms, the multiple
stacks of structure support arrangements may be displaced. That is, the multiple stacks of
structure support arrangements are no longer positioned along the boundary of the site, and
the structures fixed to the support posts 110 appear to be like a "snake" when viewed from
top. In an extreme case, this may cause the structures to fall off the support posts 110 and
damage pedestrians nearby or workers working at the site.
[000131]          Fig. 6 illustrates a structure support arrangement 1220 in accordance with yet
another preferred embodiment 600 of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 6, the structure
support arrangement 1220 further comprises a recess 610 defined on the body member 210.
The recess 610 is provided along an entire width of the body member 210 with open ends
6110 and 6120 at two sides 620 and 630 of the structure support arrangement 1220,
respectively. The recess 610 is configured to receive a horizontal bar 730 that extends to a
further structure support arrangement, particularly, into the corresponding recess of a further
structure support arrangement (shown in Fig. 7).
[000132]          Fig. 7 illustrates a plurality of structure support arrangement stacks 7110, 7120
and 7130. The stacks 7110 to 7130 are placed along a boundary of a site. A horizontal bar
730 is placed in the recesses 610 of the top structure support arrangement of each stack 7110
to 7130. The horizontal bar 730 connects the plurality of structure support arrangement stacks
7110, 7120 and 7130, and keep the plurality of structure support arrangement stacks 7110,

                                                 20
7120 and 7130 along the boundary of the site. The structures are fixed to support posts 7210,
7220 and 7230.
[000133]        If an external force is applied to the structures, the horizontal bar 730 in the
recesses 610 of the plurality of structure support arrangement stacks 7110, 7120 and 7130
effectively prevents the displacement of the plurality of structure support arrangement stacks
7110, 7120 and 7130, which dramatically reduces the possibility of the falling of the structures
from the support posts 7210, 7220 and 7230. This improves the safety at the site.
[000134]        The structure support arrangement 1210 to 1260 as described above offers a
number of advantages. First, they are easy to manufacture and ship. The design of the body
member provides sufficient prevention against displacement in transverse directions. The
structure support arrangement allows easy support to structures without making any
temporary or permanent indentations on the ground. Further, the structure support
arrangement can be easily reused any number of times between different sites. Also, the
recess for receiving the horizontal bar prevents the snaking of the structures.
[000121]        Fig. 10 and 11 illustrates a structure support arrangement in accordance with
yet another preferred embodiment 800 of the present invention. The body includes a dumbbell
shaped projection 8210 which increases the number of planar circumferential plane walls to
16 compared with 12 planar circumferential plane walls of the I-shaped projection 2210 of
earlier embodiments. This significantly increases the lateral location retention means when
engaging with the complementary dumbbell shaped cavity on the underside of the adjacent
structure support arrangement such as 801 in the stack of nestable structure support
arrangements 801 to 805 of Fig. 14.
[000135]        The counterweight 800 has two plates 8240 which are shaped with a
rectangular outer portion for attaching by screws to the body of the counterweight and with
triangular inner portions or lips that touch at their respective vertex. This substantially covers
the lateral opening into the post receiving formation 230 that the support posts is inserted.
The lateral opening is important to not allow escape of the support post out of the receiving
recess. However, it has another benefit resulting from the size and shape of the lips 8240
which provide cut-away openings 8245 allowing direct access from the outer to the support
post 110. This is particularly shown in the detail of Fig. 17 and wherein a board 120 can be
directly connected to a post 110 when received in the post receiving formation 230 even along
the portion within a stack 810 of nested structure support arrangements 800.
[000136]        As shown in Fig. 10 and Fig 17, the structure support arrangement 1220 further
comprises a recess 8610 defined on the body member 210. The recess 8610 is provided along
an entire width of the body member 210 with open ends at two sides of the structure support

                                                21
arrangement 1220, respectively. The recess 8610 is configured to receive a horizontal bar 730
that extends to a further structure support arrangement, particularly, into the corresponding
recess 8610 of a top of a further structure support arrangement on an adjacent stack 810 to
813 of Fig. 18.
[000137]         Further as shown in Fig. 17 the dovetaiul formations 250 of the earlier
embodiments are modified to be open formations 8250 that still have projections that assist in
preventing lateral motion of nested support-weights.       However when the structure support
arrangement or support-weight is used in a fence support system such as in Fig. 17 the
adjacent fence sections mounted in respective one of the fence post receiving recesses 260
can extend outwardly through the open sides of the open formations 8250 and allow the
adjacent fence sections to be up to 90 degrees to each other. Therefore, the support weight
can also form the function of a corner support of a fence system.
[000138]         As shown in Figs 18 and 19, there is a hoarding installation including a hoarding
panel 120, a panel support post 110, a plurality of stacks 810 to 813 of nestable support
weights 801 to 805, a strengthening post 104, and means to secure the hoarding panel to the
panel support post. A further bracing horizontal bar fits within the lateral recess 8610 of the
top support-weight of each similarly height stack and by the wedging in the recess between
the support post 110 and the side of the open unused dumbbell shaped nesting projection
8210 of the top support weight provides lateral stability and integrity to the hoarding installation
[000139]         The post receiving formation 230 defined by the body of the support-weight 800
can directly receive a hoarding panel support post 110 to which a hoarding panel 120 is
securable. This provides the advantage of avoiding any separate connector, extension, or
other means to receive the panel support post which is outside the form of the weight and
which may enlarge the footprint made by the combination of the weight and hoarding panel
support post. Space for workers to operate behind a hoarding panel may be limited, so a small
footprint is of great importance. Therefore as seen by Fig 16, and 18 the footprint is limited to
the length L of the support-weight
[000140]         A small footprint of the support-weight also results from: (i) the strengthening
post being directly receivable by the support-weight; and/or (ii) the shape of the support-weight
in a non-rectangular form with a wider central section (in plan view) permitting the mass of a
stack of nestable support-weights to be located closer towards the hoarding panel so the
weight extend less into the working space behind the hoarding than would be the case for
comparable rectangular plan view shaped support-weight; and/or the nestability of the
support-weights themselves.

                                                  22
[000141]         The invention has fewer interoperating parts than other systems in the prior art.
For a hoarding installation the invention requires only three components separate from the
hoarding panel, and for a fencing installation the invention requires only one component
separate from the fencing panel.
[000142]         The invention provides for easy stacking of the support-weights using handle
formations 8270 so that a support-weight can be picked up and put down without trapping the
operator's fingers. Angled corners also allow the weights to be safely stacked on pallets,
where abutting stacks of weights would again inhibit the operator's ability to safely handle the
weights. The weights are also adapted to be a convenient size and weight for lifting. Other
advantages due to the size and shape of the weights are gained in that fewer weights
(compared with prior art systems) are required to be used in conjunction with the strengthening
post to achieve certification of relevant industry standards. See, for example, Australian
Standards AS4687-2007 - "Temporary Fencing and Hoardings" and AS1170.2-2011
"Structural design actions - Wind actions".
[000143]         Use of the strengthening support post 104 raises the fulcrum point of a hoarding
installation so that it is higher than it would be without the use of the support post. This means
that collapsing of the hoarding installation is inhibited when subject to forces against a
hoarding panel.
[000144]         The orientation of a panel support post 110 having a rectangular cross-section
such that the wider dimension of the panel support post is perpendicular to the near edge of
the support-weight and thereby rectilinear to the hoarding panel 120. This orientation is
different to the prior art in which has the wider dimension of the panel support post run parallel
with the near edge of the support-weight. This perpendicular direction, providing longitudinal
alignment of the long axis of the cross sectional shape of the panel support post 110 with the
longitudinal length of the support-weight 800, which is also coaxial with the direction of
extension of the support post of the first connection means from the support post, provides
substantial strength gains, as the forces on the panel support post are concentrated about the
deep axis of the post (for example, in a commonly available shaped post, approximately 90
mm deep) instead of the shallow axis of the stud (for example, in a commonly available shaped
post, approximately 45 mm deep).
[000145]         The invention is able to used with panel support posts 110 of a standard size
(for example, a "2x4" which is approximately 40 mm x 90 mm) and meet the relevant industry
standards. The invention is able to be used with standard grade panel support posts (for
example, a MPG10 grade timber stud).

                                               23
[000146]        Where a system is not braced (for example, by attachment to a wall or ceiling)
lateral, post installation movement or "snaking" could occur. To avoid this, the invention
contemplates use of a horizontal bar 730 received into a complementary recess 8610 in the
uppermost support-weight 800 of a hoarding installation. The horizontal bar may also be
affixed to one or more panel support posts 110 (for example, by means of affixing means (such
as a screw) between the panel support post and the horizontal bar and/or the hoarding panel.
[000147]        The invention provides the user the ability to install a pre-certified and structural
engineer approved counter-weight solution. The user is able to follow a simple process and
ensure that the panels are secure, and the system is safe.
[000148]        Once a hoarding installation is complete, the support-weights 800 cannot be
removed without first removing the panels 120 (which are the area of risk if impacted). By
comparison in the prior art which uses an upright stand, the weights can be added and
removed without removing the panel and this is not tamperproof, but since the panels of a
hoarding installation in accordance with invention may screwed into the panel support post (in
the space between the plates), once the panel is secured to the panel support posts, the
support-weights cannot be removed until after the screws affixing the hoarding are removed,
and (by extension) the hoarding panel itself.
