               Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), a monoamine neurotransmitter and local
        hormone, is formed by the hydroxylation and decarboxylation of tryptophan. The great
        est concentration is found in the enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract, the
       remainder being predominantly present in platelets and in the Central Nervous System
        (CNS). 5-HT is implicated in a vast array of physiological and pathophysiological
        pathways. In the periphery, it contracts a number of smooth muscles and induces endo
        thelium-dependent vasodilation. In the CNS, it is believed to be involved in a wide
       range of functions, including the control of appetite, mood, anxiety, hallucinations,
        sleep, vomiting and pain perception.
               Neurons that secrete 5-HT are termed serotonergic. The function of 5-HT is ex
        erted upon its interaction with specific (serotonergic) neurons. Seven types of 5-HT
       receptors have been identified: 5-HT1 (with subtypes 5-HTIA, 5-HTiB, 5-HTID, 5-UTIE
        and 5-HTIF), 5-HT 2 (with subtypes 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2c), 5-HT 3 , 5-HT 4 , 5-HT 5
        (with subtypes 5-HT5A and 5-HT 5B), 5-HT6 and 5-HT 7. Most of these receptors are
        coupled to G-proteins that affect the activities of adenylate cyclase or phospholipase Cy.
               Alterations in the activity of multiple neurotransmitter receptor systems (dopa
        mine, serotonin, glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine) have been implicated in the manifes
(14173015_1):GGG

        Alterations in the activity of multiple neurotransmitter receptor systems (dopa
mine, serotonin, glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine) have been implicated in the manifes
tation of the symptoms of schizophrenia. The most widely accepted "Dopamine Hy
pothesis of Schizophrenia" in its simplest form states that the positive symptoms of this
pathology relate to a functional hyperactivity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system,
while the negative and cognitive aspects can be traced to a functional hypoactivity of
the mesocortical dopaminergic projections. Atypical antipsychotics block the meso
limbic dopaminergic neurotransmission, thereby controlling positive symptoms, with
little or no effect on the nigrostriatal system, leading to less induction of extrapyramidal
side effects (EPS).
        Primary negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia reflect a dysfunction
of the frontal cortex ("hypofrontality"), which is thought to be induced by a decreased
tone in the mesocortical dopaminergic projection field [Davis KL, Kahn RS, Ko G and
Davidson M (1991). Dopamine in schizophrenia: a review and re-conceptualization.
Am JPsychiatry148: 1474 - 86. Weinberger DR and Berman KF (1996). Prefrontal
function in schizophrenia: confounds and controversies. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol
Sci 351: 1495 - 503]. Agents that selectively enhance dopamine levels in the cortex
have the potential to address the negative symptoms of this disorder. Atypical antipsy
chotics lack robust efficacy against negative and cognitive components of the schizo
phrenic syndrome.
        The schizophrenic symptomatology is further complicated by the occurrence of
drug-induced so-called secondary negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, which
are difficult to distinguish from primary negative and cognitive symptoms [Remington
G and Kapur S (2000). Atypical antipsychotics: are some more atypical than others?
Psychopharmacol148: 3 - 15]. The occurrence of secondary negative symptoms not
only limits therapeutic efficacy but also, together with these side effects, negatively af
fects patient compliance.
        It may thus be hypothesized that a novel mechanistic approach that blocks dopa
minergic neurotransmission in the limbic system but does not affect the striatal and pitu
itary projection fields, and stimulates frontocortical projection fields, would provide an
efficacious treatment for all parts of the schizophrenic pathology, including its positive,
negative and cognitive symptoms. Moreover, a selective compound that is substantially

                                               3
free of the ancillary pharmacology that characterizes current agents would be expected
to avoid a variety of off-target side effects that plague current treatments such as extrap
yramidal side effects (EPS) and weight gain.
       The 5-HT 2c receptor, previously named 5-HTI C, is a G-protein-coupled receptor,
which couples to multiple cellular effector systems including the phospholipase C, A
and D pathways. It is found primarily in the brain and its distribution is particularly
high in the plexus choroideus, where it is assumed to control cerebrospinal fluid produc
tion [Kaufman MJ, Hirata F (1996) Cyclic GMP inhibits phosphoinositide turnover in
choroid plexus: evidence for interactions between second messengers concurrently trig
gered by 5-HT 2c receptors. Neurosci Lett 206:153-156]. Very high levels were also
found in the retrosplenial, piriform and entorhinal cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus,
lateral septal nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, amygdala, subiculum and ventral part of
CA3, lateral habenula, substantia nigra pars compacta, several brainstem nuclei and the
whole grey matter of the spinal cord [Pompeiano M, Palacios JM, Mengod G (1994).
Distribution of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptor family mRNAs: comparison between 5
HT2A and 5-HT 2c receptors. Brain Res Mol Brain Res 23:163-178]. A comparison of
the distribution of 5-HT 2c mRNA with that of 5-HT 2c protein in monkey and human
brains has revealed both pre- and postsynaptic localization [Lopez-Gimenez JF, Men
god G, Palacios JM, Vilaro MT (2001) Regional distribution and cellular localization of
5-HT 2c receptor mRNA in monkey brain: comparison with [3H]mesulergine binding
sites and choline acetyltransferase mRNA. Synapse 42:12-26].
       It is anticipated that modulation of the 5-HT 2c receptor will improve disorders
such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, cognitive deficits of schizophrenia, obses
sive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, migraine, epilepsy, substance abuse, eating
disorders, obesity, diabetes, sexual dysfunction/erectile dysfunction, sleep disorders,
psoriasis, Parkinson's disease, pain conditions and disorders, and spinal cord injury,
smoking cessation, ocular hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. Modulators of the 5
HT 2c receptor are also shown to be useful in the modulation of bladder function, includ
ing the prevention or treatment of urinary incontinence.
       There is an ongoing need for providing compounds having high affinity and selec
tivity for the 5-HT 2c receptor. In particular the compounds should have low affinity to
adrenergic receptors, such as the a1 -adrenergic receptor, histamine receptors, such as

                                               4
the H1 -receptor, and dopaminergic receptors, such as the D 2-receptor, in order to avoid
or reduce side effects associated with modulation of these receptors, such as postural
hypotension, reflex tachycardia, potentiation of the antihypertensive effect of prazosin,
terazosin, doxazosin and labetalol or dizziness associated with the blockade of the a1
adrenergic receptor, weight gain, sedation, drowsiness or potentiation of central depres
sant drugs associated with the blockade of the HI-receptor, or extrapyramidal movement
disorder, such as dystonia, parkinsonism, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia or rabbit syn
drome, or endocrine effects, such as prolactin elevation (galactorrhea, gynecomastia,
mentstrual changes, sexual dysfunction in males), associated with the blockade of the
D2 -receptor.
      The present invention provides compounds which have an affinity for the 5-HT 2c,
thus allowing the treatment of disorders related to or affected by the 5-HT 2c receptor.
                            SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
         The invention is directed to tricyclic quino line and quinoxaline derivatives,
compositions comprising such compounds, their use as modulators, especially agonists
or partial agonists, of the 5-HT 2c receptor, their use for preparing a medicament for the
prevention or treatment of conditions and disorders which respond to the modulation of
5-HT 2c receptor, to a method for preventing or treating conditions and disorders which

                                DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         The compounds of the formula I may exist in different spatial arrangements. For
example, if the compounds possess one or more centers of asymmetry, polysubstituted
rings or double bonds, or as different tautomers, the present invention contemplates the
possible use of enantiomeric mixtures, in particular racemates, diastereomeric mixtures
and tautomeric mixtures, such as the respective essentially pure enantiomers, diastere
omers and tautomers of the compounds of formula I and/or their salts.
         It is likewise possible to use physiologically tolerated salts of the compounds of
the formula I, especially acid addition salts with physiologically tolerated acids. Exam
ples of suitable physiologically tolerated organic and inorganic acids are hydrochloric

                                                27

as benzenesulfonic acid and toluenesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid,
lactic acid, tartaric acid, adipic acid and benzoic acid. Other utilizable acids are de
scribed in Fortschritte der Arzneimittelforschung [Advances in drug research], Volume
 10, pages 224 et seq., Birkhauser Verlag, Basel and Stuttgart, 1966.
         The compounds of formula I may also be present in the form of tautomers. In
one aspect, tautomery may be present in compounds I wherein R4a and R4b form togeth
er a group =0 and R       or R   is H. For example, the compounds of formula I may have
the following tautomeric formulae:

In a specific embodiment, the invention relates to compounds I selected from the com
pounds of the examples, either in form of free bases or of any pharmaceutically ac
ceptable salt thereof or a steroisomer thereof.
       The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by using routine tech
niques familiar to a skilled person. In particular, the compounds of the formula I can be
prepared according to the following schemes, wherein the variables, if not stated other

       Compounds I wherein R4 a and R4b are not H or do not form together a group =0
can be prepared by standard derivatization methods of compounds wherein R4a and R4b
form together a group =0. For instance, compounds wherein R4a and R4b form together
a group =S may be prepared by reaction with a sulfurization agent, such as Lawesson's
reagent or P2S5 . Alkyl and related groups as radicals R4a and R4b may be introduced via
Grignard reduction. Amino and related groups may be introduced via reductive amina
tion. Hydroxyl group R4a or R4b may be introduced by reducing the carbonyl group.
This may be alkylated to yield alkoxy and related groups R4a and R4b or substituted by
diverse groups.
       If not otherwise indicated, the above-described reactions are generally carried out
in a solvent at temperatures between room temperature and the boiling temperature of
the solvent employed. Alternatively, the activation energy which is required for the re
action can be introduced into the reaction mixture using microwaves, something which
has proved to be of value, in particular, in the case of the reactions catalyzed by transi
tion metals (with regard to reactions using microwaves, see Tetrahedron 2001, 57, p.

       The acid addition salts of compounds I are prepared in a customary manner by
mixing the free base with a corresponding acid, where appropriate in solution in an or
ganic solvent, for example a lower alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol or propanol, an
ether, such as methyl tert-butyl ether or diisopropyl ether, a ketone, such as acetone or
methyl ethyl ketone, or an ester, such as ethyl acetate.
         Routine experimentations, including appropriate manipulation of the reaction
conditions, reagents and sequence of the synthetic route, protection of any chemical
functionality that may not be compatible with the reaction conditions, and deprotection
at a suitable point in the reaction sequence of the preparation methods are within routine
techniques.
         Suitable protecting groups and the methods for protecting and deprotecting dif
ferent substituents using such suitable protecting groups are well known to those skilled
in the art; examples of which may be found in T. Greene and P. Wuts, Protective
Groups in Organic Synthesis ( 3 rd ed.), John Wiley & Sons, NY (1999), which is herein
incorporated by reference in its entirety. Synthesis of the compounds of the invention
may be accomplished by methods analogous to those described in the synthetic schemes
described hereinabove and in specific examples.
         Starting materials, if not commercially available, may be prepared by procedures
selected from standard organic chemical techniques, techniques that are analogous to
the synthesis of known, structurally similar compounds, or techniques that are analo
gous to the above described schemes or the procedures described in the synthetic exam
ples section.
         When an optically active form of a compound of the invention is required, it
may be obtained by carrying out one of the procedures described herein using an opti
cally active starting material (prepared, for example, by asymmetric induction of a suit
able reaction step), or by resolution of a mixture of the stereoisomers of the compound
or intermediates using a standard procedure (such as chromatographic separation, re
crystallization or enzymatic resolution).
       Similarly, when a pure geometric isomer of a compound of the invention is re
quired, it may be obtained by carrying out one of the above procedures using a pure
geometric isomer as a starting material, or by resolution of a mixture of the geometric

                                               131
isomers of the compound or intermediates using a standard procedure such as chroma
tographic separation.
       Moreover, the present invention relates to compounds of formula I as defined
above, wherein at least one of the atoms has been replaced by its stable, non-radioactive
                                                 13   14
isotope (e.g., hydrogen by deuterium,    12C  by   C,   N by 15N, 160 by 180) and preferably
wherein at least one hydrogen atom has been replaced by a deuterium atom.
       Additionally, the compounds according to the invention include more of the re
spective isotope than occurs naturally occurs and which is present in compounds I.
       Stable isotopes (e.g., deuterium,  1C,   1N, 180) are nonradioactive isotopes which
contain one additional neutron than the normally abundant isotope of the respective at
om. Deuterated compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the
in vivo metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and
metabolic pathway of the non deuterated parent compound (Blake et al. J. Pharm. Sci.
64, 3, 367-391 (1975)). Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe, ef
fective therapeutic drugs, either because the in vivo active compound administered to
the patient or because the metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be
toxic or carcinogenic (Foster et al., Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14, pp. 2-36, Aca
demic press, London, 1985; Kato et al., J. Labelled Comp. Radiopharmaceut.,
36(10):927-932 (1995); Kushner et al., Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol.,77, 79-88 (1999)).
       Incorporation of a heavy atom, particularly substitution of deuterium for hydro
gen, can give rise to an isotope effect that could alter the pharmacokinetics of the drug.
       Stable isotope labeling of a drug can alter its physico-chemical properties such as
pKa and lipid solubility. These changes may influence the fate of the drug at different
steps along its passage through the body. Absorption, distribution, metabolism or excre
tion can be changed. Absorption and distribution are processes that depend primarily on
the molecular size and the lipophilicity of the substance. These effects and alterations
can affect the pharmacodynamic response of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitu
tion affects a region involved in a ligand-receptor interaction.
       Drug metabolism can give rise to large isotopic effect if the breaking of a chemi
cal bond to a deuterium atom is the rate limiting step in the process. While some of the
physical properties of a stable isotope-labeled molecule are different from those of the
unlabeled one, the chemical and biological properties are the same, with one important

                                             132
exception: because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope, any bond involving the
heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond between the light
isotope and that atom. In any reaction in which the breaking of this bond is the rate lim
iting step, the reaction will proceed slower for the molecule with the heavy isotope due
to "kinetic isotope effect". A reaction involving breaking a C--D bond can be up to 700
percent slower than a similar reaction involving breaking a C--H bond. If the C--D bond
is not involved in any of the steps leading to the metabolite, there may not be any effect
to alter the behavior of the drug. If a deuterium is placed at a site involved in the metab
olism of a drug, an isotope effect will be observed only if breaking of the C--D bond is
the rate limiting step. There is evidence to suggest that whenever cleavage of an aliphat
ic C--H bond occurs, usually by oxidation catalyzed by a mixed-function oxidase, re
placement of the hydrogen by deuterium will lead to observable isotope effect. It is also
important to understand that the incorporation of deuterium at the site of metabolism
slows its rate to the point where another metabolite produced by attack at a carbon atom
not substituted by deuterium becomes the major pathway a process called "metabolic
switching".
       Deuterium tracers, such as deuterium-labeled drugs and doses, in some cases re
peatedly, of thousands of milligrams of deuterated water, are also used in healthy hu
mans of all ages, including neonates and pregnant women, without reported incident
(e.g. Pons G and Rey E, Pediatrics 1999 104: 633; Coward W A et al., Lancet 1979 7:
 13; Schwarcz H P, Control. Clin. Trials 1984 5(4 Suppl): 573; Rodewald L E et al., J.
Pediatr. 1989 114: 885; Butte N F et al. Br. J. Nutr. 1991 65: 3; MacLennan A H et al.
Am. J. Obstet Gynecol. 1981 139: 948). Thus, it is clear that any deuterium released, for
instance, during the metabolism of compounds of this invention poses no health risk.
       The weight percentage of hydrogen in a mammal (approximately 9%) and natural
abundance of deuterium (approximately 0.015%) indicates that a 70 kg human normally
contains nearly a gram of deuterium. Furthermore, replacement of up to about 15% of
normal hydrogen with deuterium has been effected and maintained for a period of days
to weeks in mammals, including rodents and dogs, with minimal observed adverse ef
fects (Czajka D M and Finkel A J, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1960 84: 770; Thomson J F,
Ann. New York Acad. Sci 1960 84: 736; Czakja D M et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1961 201:
357). Higher deuterium concentrations, usually in excess of 20%, can be toxic in ani-

                                             133
mals. However, acute replacement of as high as 15%-23% of the hydrogen in humans'
fluids with deuterium was found not to cause toxicity (Blagojevic N et al. in "Dosimetry
& Treatment Planning for Neutron Capture Therapy", Zamenhof R, Solares G and Harl
ing 0 Eds. 1994. Advanced Medical Publishing, Madison Wis. pp.125-134; Diabetes
Metab. 23: 251 (1997)).
       Increasing the amount of deuterium present in a compound above its natural
abundance is called enrichment or deuterium-enrichment. Examples of the amount of
enrichment include from about 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37,
42, 46, 50, 54, 58, 63, 67, 71, 75, 79, 84, 88, 92, 96, to about 100 mol %.
       The hydrogens present on a particular organic compound have different capacities
for exchange with deuterium. Certain hydrogen atoms are easily exchangeable under
physiological conditions and, if replaced by deuterium atoms, it is expected that they
will readily exchange for protons after administration to a patient. Certain hydrogen
atoms may be exchanged for deuterium atoms by the action of a deuteric acid such as
D2 SO 4 /D 2 0. Alternatively, deuterium atoms may be incorporated in various combina
tions during the synthesis of compounds of the invention. Certain hydrogen atoms are
not easily exchangeable for deuterium atoms. However, deuterium atoms at the remain
ing positions may be incorporated by the use of deuterated starting materials or inter
mediates during the construction of compounds of the invention.
       Deuterated and deuterium-enriched compounds of the invention can be prepared
by using known methods described in the literature. Such methods can be carried out
utilizing corresponding deuterated and optionally, other isotope-containing reagents
and/or intermediates to synthesize the compounds delineated herein, or invoking stand
ard synthetic protocols known in the art for introducing isotopic atoms to a chemical
structure. Relevant procedures and intermediates are disclosed, for instance in Lizondo,

       Disorders or diseases of the central nervous system are understood as meaning
disorders which affect the spinal cord and, in particular, the brain. These are, for exam
ple, cognitive dysfunction, attention deficit disorder/hyperactivity syndrome and cogni
tive deficits related with schizophrenia, attention deficit/hyperactivity syndrome, per
sonality disorders, affective disorders, motion or motor disorders, pain, migraine, sleep
disorders (including disturbances of the Circadian rhythm), feeding disorders, diseases
associated with neurodegeneration, addiction diseases, obesity or psoriasis.
         Examples of cognitive dysfunction are deficits in memory, cognition, and learn
ing, Alzheimer's disease, age-related cognitive decline, and mild cognitive impairment,
or any combinations thereof. Examples of personality disorders are schizophrenia and
cognitive deficits related to schizophrenia. Examples of affective disorders are depres
sion, anxiety, bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorders, or any combination
thereof. Examples of motion or motor disorders are Parkinson's disease and epilepsy.
Examples of feeding disorders are obesity, bulimia, weight loss and anorexia, especially
anorexia nervosa. Examples of diseases associated with neurodegeneration are stroke,
spinal or head trauma, and head injuries, such as hydrocephalus.

                                             136
       Pain condition includes nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain or a combination
thereof. Such pain conditions or disorders can include, but are not limited to, post
operative pain, osteoarthritis pain, pain due to inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis pain,
musculoskeletal pain, burn pain (including sunburn), ocular pain, the pain associated
with dental conditions (such as dental caries and gingivitis), post-partum pain, bone
fracture, herpes, HIV, traumatic nerve injury, stroke, post-ischemia, fibromyalgia, reflex
sympathetic dystrophy, complex regional pain syndrome, spinal cord injury, sciatica,
phantom limb pain, diabetic neuropathy, hyperalgesia and cancer.
       In certain other embodiments, the disease condition is bladder dysfunction, in
cluding urinary incontinence.
       Diabetes includes diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, type I diabetes, type II di
abetes, type III diabetes, diabetes secondary to pancreatic diseases, diabetes related to
steroid use, diabetes complications, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance.
       The addiction diseases include psychiatric disorders and behavioral disturbances
which are caused by the abuse of psychotropic substances, such as pharmaceuticals or
narcotics, and also other addiction diseases, such as addiction to gaming (impulse con
trol disorders not elsewhere classified). Examples of addictive substances are: opioids
(e.g. morphine, heroin and codeine), cocaine; nicotine; alcohol; substances which inter
act with the GABA chloride channel complex, sedatives, hypnotics and tranquilizers,
for example benzodiazepines; LSD; cannabinoids; psychomotor stimulants, such as 3,4
methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (ecstasy); amphetamine and amphetamine-like
substances such as methylphenidate, other stimulants including caffeine and nicotine.
Addictive substances which come particularly into consideration are opioids, cocaine,
amphetamine or amphetamine-like substances, nicotine and alcohol. Especially, addic
tion disorders include alcohol abuse, cocaine abuse, tobacco abuse and smoking cessa
tion.
       With regard to the treatment of addiction diseases, particular preference is given
to those compounds according to the invention of the formula (I) which themselves do
not possess any psychotropic effect. This can also be observed in a test using rats,
which, after having been administered compounds which can be used in accordance
with the invention, reduce their self administration of psychotropic substances, for ex
ample cocaine.

                                              137

eases, diabetes related to steroid use, diabetes complications, hyperglycemia and insulin
resistance, and are specifically schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorders, obesity or
substance use disorders.
         The compounds of the invention may be used for a preventive treatment
(prophylaxis), in particular as relapse prophylaxis or phase prophylaxis, but are prefera
bly used for a treatment in its proper sense, i.e. for the treatment of acute or chronic
signs, symptoms and/or malfunctions. The treatment can be orientated symptomatically,
for example as the suppression of symptoms. It can be effected over a short period, be
orientated over the medium term or can be a long-term treatment, for example within
the context of a maintenance therapy.
         In another embodiment, the present invention relates to the use of a compound I
as defined above or an N-oxide, a tautomeric form, a stereoisomer or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof for preparing a medicament for preventing (the development of)

       There are several lines of evidence suggesting that 5-HT 2c agonists or partial ago
nists would have therapeutic use in a variety of diseases, disorders and conditions.
       Knockout mice models lacking the 5-HT 2c receptor exhibit hyperphagia, obesity
and are more prone to seizures and sudden death [Tecott LH, Sun LM, Akana SF,
Strack AM, Lowenstein DH, Dallman MF, Julius D (1995) Eating disorder and epilepsy
in mice lacking 5-HT 2c serotonin receptors. Nature 374:542-546]. They also exhibit
compulsive-like behavior [Chou-Green JM, Holscher TD, Dallman MF, Akana SF
(2003). Compulsive behavior in the 5-HT 2c receptor knockout mouse. Phys. Behav.
78:641-649], hyperresponsiveness to repeated stress [Chou-Green JM, Holscher TD,

hydroxytryptamine 2C receptor mutant mice. J. Neurosci. 22:10039-10045].
       5-HT 2c is unique among other G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in that its
pre-mRNA is a substrate for base modification via hydrolytic deamination of adeno
sines to yield inosines. Five adenosines, located within a sequence encoding the puta
tive second intracellular domain can be converted to inosines. This editing can alter the
coding potential of the triplet codons and allows for the generation of multiple different
receptor isoforms. The edited receptor isoforms were shown to have reduced ability to
interact with G-proteins in the absence of agonist stimulation [Werry, TD, Loiacono R,
Sexton PA, Christopoulos A (2008). RNA editing of the serotonin 5-HT 2c receptor and
its effects on cell signaling, pharmacology and brain function. Pharmac. Therap. 119:7
23].
       Edited 5-HT 2c isoforms with reduced function are significantly expressed in the
brains of depressed suicide victims [Schmauss C (2003) Serotonin 2C receptors: sui
cide, serotonin, and runaway RNA editing. Neuroscientist9:237-242. Iwamoto K, Kato
T (2003). RNA editing of serotonin 2C receptor in human postmortem brains of major
mental disorders. Neurosci. Lett. 346:169-172] and in the learned helplessness rats (a
well established animal model of depression) [Iwamotoa K, Nakatanib N, Bundoa M,
Yoshikawab T, Katoa T (2005). Altered RNA editing of serotonin 2C receptor in a rat
model of depression. Neurosci. Res.53: 69-76] suggesting a link between 5-HT 2c func
tion and depression. There are also implications of edited 5-HT 2c isoforms and spatial
memory [Du Y, Stasko M, Costa AC, Davissone MT, Gardiner KJ (2007). Editing of
the serotonin 2C receptor pre-mRNA Effects of the Morris Water Maze. Gene 391:186
 197]. In addition, fully edited isoforms of the human 5-HT 2c receptor display a striking
reduction in sensitivity to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and to atypical antipsychot
ic drugs clozapine and loxapine, suggesting a possible role of the receptor in the etiolo
gy and pharmacology of schizophrenia [Niswender CM, Herrick-Davis K,. Dilley GE,

       Recently, the availability of potent and selective 5-HT 2c receptor agonists made it
possible to directly investigate the effects of 5-HT 2c agonists and their therapeutic po
tential. Thus recent studies demonstrated that selective 5-HT 2c agonists resulted in de
creased food intake and body weight gain in normal and obese rats [Smith BM, et al.

       Furthermore, selective 5-HT 2c receptor agonists produce antidepressant effects in
animal models of depression comparable to those of SSRIs but with a much faster onset
of action and a therapeutic window that avoids antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunc
tion. These agonists were also effective in animal models of compulsive behavior such
as scheduled induced polydipsia and they also exhibited decreased hyperactivity and
aggression in rodents [Rosenzweig-Lipson S, Sabb A, Stack G, Mitchell P, Lucki I,

       Acute or chronic administration of 5-HT 2c agonists decreases the firing rate of
ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons but not that of substantia nigra. In addition 5
HT 2c agonists reduce dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens but not in the striatum
(the region of the brain mostly associated with extrapyramidal side effects) [Di Matteo,

decrease mesolimibic dopamine levels without affecting the nigrostriatal pathway thus
avoiding the EPS side effects of typical antipsychotics. Several 5-HT 2c receptor ago
nists have shown antipsychotic activity in animal models of schizophrenia without EPS
based on the lack of effect in catalepsy [Marquis KL, Sabb AL, Logue SF, Brennan JA,

their beneficial effects in mood disorders and cognition and their antiobesity like effects

       In the use and the method of the invention, an effective quantity of one or more
compounds, as a rule formulated in accordance with pharmaceutical and veterinary
practice, is administered to the individual to be treated, preferably a mammal, in particu
lar a human being, productive animal or domestic animal. Whether such a treatment is
indicated, and in which form it is to take place, depends on the individual case and is
subject to medical assessment (diagnosis) which takes into consideration signs, symp
toms and/or malfunctions which are present, the risks of developing particular signs,
symptoms and/or malfunctions, and other factors.
         Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of
the present invention can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active compound(s)
that is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular subject (e.g.,
a mammal, preferably, a human (patient)), compositions and mode of administration.
The selected dosage level will depend upon the activity of the particular compound, the
route of administration, the severity of the condition being treated and the condition and
prior medical history of the patient being treated. However, it is within the skill of the
art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired
therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is
achieved.

pharmaceutical composition comprising the compounds of interest in combination with
at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The phrase "therapeutically effective
amount" of the compound of the present invention means a sufficient amount of the
compound to treat disorders, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical
treatment. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds
and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician
within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose
level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disor
der being treated and the severity of the disorder; activity of the specific compound em
ployed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex
and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of
excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used
in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors
well-known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start
doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic
effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.
         The total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a subject
(namely, a mammal, such as a human) ranges from about 0.01 mg/kg body weight to
about 100 mg/kg body weight. More preferable doses can be in the range of from about
0.01 mg/kg body weight to about 30 mg/kg body weight. If desired, the effective daily
dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration. Consequently,
single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up
the daily dose.
         In one aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions. The
pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise the compounds of the
present invention or an N-oxide, a tautomeric form, a stereoisomer or a pharmaceutical
ly acceptable salt or solvate thereof. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present
invention comprise compounds of the present invention that can be formulated together
with at least one non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
         In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical
composition comprising compounds of the present invention or an N-oxide, a tautomer-

                                               146
ic form, a stereoisomer or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and one or more
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, alone or in combination with one or more com
pounds that are not the compounds of the present invention. Examples of one or more
compounds that can be combined with the compounds of the present invention in phar
maceutical compositions, include, but are not limited to, one or more cognitive enhanc
ing drugs.
         The pharmaceutical compositions of this present invention can be administered
to a subject (e.g., a mammal, such as a human) orally, rectally, parenterally, intracister
nally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments or drops),
bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term "parenterally" as used herein, refers to
modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, in
trasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.
         The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" as used herein, means a non
toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formula
tion auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceu
tically acceptable carriers are sugars such as, but not limited to, lactose, glucose and
sucrose; starches such as, but not limited to, corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and
its derivatives such as, but not limited to, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellu
lose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as,
but not limited to, cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as, but not limited to,
peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil;
glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as, but not limited to, ethyl oleate and ethyl
laurate; agar; buffering agents such as, but not limited to, magnesium hydroxide and
aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solu
tion; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compati
ble lubricants such as, but not limited to, sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate,
as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and
perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition,
according to the judgment of the formulator.
         Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for parenteral injection
comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, disper
sions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile

                                              147
injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and
nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such
as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like), vegetable oils (such as
olive oil), injectable organic esters (such as ethyl oleate) and suitable mixtures thereof.
Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as
lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and
by the use of surfactants.
         These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting
agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microor
ganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents,
for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be
desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Pro
longed absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the
inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
         In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to slow
the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This can be
accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material
with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate
of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alter
natively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished
by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.
         Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug
in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio
of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug
release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include
poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared
by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body
tissues.
         The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a
bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid
compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile inject
able medium just prior to use.

                                               148
         Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, pow
ders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be mixed with
at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier, such as sodium cit
rate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, su
crose, glucose, mannitol and silicic acid; b) binders such as carboxymethylcellulose,
alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia; c) humectants such as glyc
erol; d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca
starch, alginic acid, certain silicates and sodium carbonate; e) solution retarding agents
such as paraffin; f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds;
g) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents such as
kaolin and bentonite clay and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium
stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate and mixtures thereof In the
case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.
         Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and
hard-filled gelatin capsules using such carriers as lactose or milk sugar as well as high
molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.
         The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills and granules can be
prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well
known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying
agents and may also be of a composition such that they release the active ingredient(s)
only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed
manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric
substances and waxes.
       The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate,
with one or more of the above-mentioned carriers.
         Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable
emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active com
pounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art
such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as
ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl
benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular,
cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydro-

                                              149
furfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan and mixtures
thereof.
         Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions may also include adjuvants such as
wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfum
ing agents.
         Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending
agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and
sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar
agar, tragacanth and mixtures thereof.
         Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories
which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non
irritating carriers or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository
wax which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore
melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.
         Compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of
liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids
or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated
liquid crystals which are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologi
cally acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The
present compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the
present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients and the like. The preferred lipids
are natural and synthetic phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins) used sepa
rately or together.
         Methods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, Prescott,
Ed., Methods in Cell Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1976), p.
33 et seq.
         Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of the present invention
include powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed
under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed pre
servatives, buffers or propellants which may be required. Ophthalmic formulations, eye
ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of
this invention.

                                              150
         The compounds of the present invention can be used in the form of pharmaceu
tically acceptable salts derived from inorganic or organic acids. The phrase "pharma
ceutically acceptable salt" means those salts which are, within the scope of sound medi
cal judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals
without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like and are commensurate
with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
         Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, S. M.
Berge et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in (J. Pharmaceutical
Sciences, 1977, 66: 1 et seq.). The salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation
and purification of the compounds of the invention or separately by reacting a free base
function with a suitable organic acid. Representative acid addition salts include, but are
not limited to acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate,
bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, digluconate, glycerophosphate, hem
isulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2
hydroxyethansulfonate (isothionate), lactate, malate, maleate, methanesulfonate, nico
tinate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, palmitoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3
phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, phos
phate, glutamate, bicarbonate, p-toluenesulfonate and undecanoate. Also, the basic ni
trogen-containing groups can be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides
such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and io
dides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain
halides such as, but not limited to, decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bro
mides and iodides; arylalkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others.
Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are thereby obtained. Examples of acids
which can be employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include
such inorganic acids as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, and phos
phoric acid and such organic acids as acetic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, 4
methylbenzenesulfonic acid, succinic acid and citric acid.
         Basic addition salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purifi
cation of compounds of this invention by reacting a carboxylic acid-containing moiety
with a suitable base such as, but not limited to, the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate
of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation or with ammonia or an organic primary,

                                                151
secondary or tertiary amine. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not lim
ited to, cations based on alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such as, but not limited to,
lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and aluminum salts and the like and
nontoxic quaternary ammonia and amine cations including ammonium, tetrame
thylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylammonium, dimethylammonium, trime
thylammonium, triethylammonium, diethylammonium, ethylammonium and the like.
Other representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts in
clude ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperidine, piperazine and the
like.
         The compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated as well as solv
ated forms, including hydrated forms, such as hemi-hydrates. In general, the solvated
forms, with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water and ethanol among oth
ers are equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the invention.
       The following examples serve to explain the invention without limiting it.
Examples
The compounds were either characterized via proton-NMR in d 6-dimethylsulfoxide or
d-chloroform or d 4-methanol on a 400 MHz or 500 MHz NMR instrument (Bruker
AVANCE), or by mass spectrometry, generally recorded via HPLC-MS in a fast gradi
ent on C 18-material (electrospray-ionisation (ESI) mode).
The magnetic nuclear resonance spectral properties (NMR) refer to the chemical shifts
(6) expressed in parts per million (ppm). The relative area of the shifts in the 'H-NMR
spectrum corresponds to the number of hydrogen atoms for a particular functional type
in the molecule. The nature of the shift, as regards multiplicity, is indicated as sin
glet (s), broad singlet (s. br.), doublet (d), broad doublet (d br.), triplet (t), broad triplet (t
br.), quartet (q), quintet (quint.) and multiplet (m).
Enantiomers were separated / purified either by chiral supercritical fluid chromatog
raphy (SFC) (method A) or by chiral HPLC (method B).

Method A - Chiral Analytical SFC
Analytical SFC was performed on an Aurora A5 SFC Fusion and Agilent 1100 system
running under Agilent Chemstation software control. The SFC system included a 10
way column switcher, C02 pump, modifier pump, oven, and backpressure regulator.
The mobile phase comprised of supercritical C02 supplied by a beverage-grade C02
cylinder with a modifier mixture of methanol at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. Oven tempera
ture was at 35 0C and the outlet pressure at 150 bar. The UV detector was set to collect
at wavelengths of 220nm and 254 nm. The mobile phase gradient started with 5% modi
fier and held it for 0.1 minutes at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, then the flow rate was
ramped up to 3 mL/min and held for 0.4 min. The modifier was ramped from 5% to
 15% over the next 8 minutes at 3 mL/min then held for 1 minute at 15% modifier (3
mL/min). The gradient was ramped down from 15% to 5% modifier over 0.5 min (3
mL/min). The instrument was fitted with a Chiralpak AS-H column with dimensions of
4.6 mm i.d. x 150 mm length with 5 gm particles.

II.   Biological tests
Functional activity

                                            217
The functional activity of compounds of formula I was assayed by incubation with
U2OS_HTR 2cp-Arrestin cells (DiscoverX, 93-0289C3) to induce beta-arrestin2 re
cruitment to the 5-HT 2c receptor. The agonist-induced recruitment and proximity of the
receptor and beta-arrestin2 leads to complementation and formation of active p
galactosidase. The enzyme complementation results in enzyme activity, which is meas
ured following the termination of the agonist incubation using DiscoveRx's detection
reagent, which contains a chemiluminescent substrate which produces a high intensity
signal. Cells were plated and a medium-change to a 1% serum containing medium was
performed 24h later. The next day, test compounds were added and incubated for 1.5 h
before addition of detection reagent.
The response produced was measured and compared with the response produced by 10
[mu]M 5-HT or the maximal effect induced by 5-HT (defined as 100%) to which it was
expressed as a percentage response (relative efficacy). Dose response curves were con
structed using Graphpad Prism (Graph Software Inc.) or using in house adapted soft
ware using a 4 parameter dose response model with variable slope (fit    = (Bottom +
(Top-Bottom)/(1+10^((LogEC50-x)*HillSlope))res       = (y-fit)). Results are compiled in
the table below.
