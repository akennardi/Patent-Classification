                              CHAIR COVER PLAYSET
               CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[ooo]          This application claims priority to US Non-Provisional Patent
Application, serial number 15839273, filed in the United States Patent Office on
December 12, 2017, which is a non provisional utility application of provisional
patent application, serial number 62/435,663, filed in the United States Patent
Office on December 16, 2016, the contents of each of which is expressly
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
                                  TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]   The present disclosure relates generally to a playset. More particularly, the
present disclosure relates to a set of fabric covers that are configured to simulate
ubiquitous kitchen items and appliances and are provided rigidity and stature by
ordinary household chairs.
                                    BACKGROUND
[0003] Children love to pretend to do the same activities and tasks they observe
their parents and caregivers performing. Accordingly, among the most popular
toys and play items are child-sized items that mimic everyday household items
used by adults.
[0004] The ubiquitous play kitchen has been one of the most popular playsets
throughout the ages. Such kitchen playsets were often hand carved from wood
more than a century ago, were later fabricated from folded sheet metal, and most
recently are assembled from panels and components that are molded from plastic.
[ooo5] Once these playsets are manufactured, they require significant shelf space
at retailers and incur substantial shipping costs during distribution. And once they
are assembled by the end user, they occupy significant playroom floor space and
are not easily moved from place to place - or even from room to room.
Accordingly, it is not possible for a child to bring them along on vacation or when
                                             1

visiting a relative. Furthermore, unlike other toys that may be simply put away
when not in use, a typical kitchen playset nevertheless must remain 'out', since
few families have a convenient storage space that could accommodate such a
bulky item.
[ooo6] While these units may be suitable for the particular purpose employed, or
for general use, they would not be as suitable for the purposes of the present
disclosure as disclosed hereafter.
[0007] In the present disclosure, where a document, act or item of knowledge is
referred to or discussed, this reference or discussion is not an admission that the
document, act or item of knowledge or any combination thereof was at the priority
date, publicly available, known to the public, part of common general knowledge
or otherwise constitutes prior art under the applicable statutory provisions; or is
known to be relevant to an attempt to solve any problem with which the present
disclosure is concerned.
[ooo8] While certain aspects of conventional technologies have been discussed
to facilitate the present disclosure, no technical aspects are disclaimed and it is
contemplated that the claims may encompass one or more of the conventional
technical aspects discussed herein.
                                            2

                                   BRIEF SUMMARY
[ooo9] An aspect of an example embodiment in the present disclosure is to
provide a playset that may be easily deployed for use and may be effectively
stored when not in use. Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a playset that
is configured as one or more chair covers that may be quickly and easily
positioned on any existing household chair just prior to use, and then removed,
folded, and stored when not in use.
[ooio] It is another aspect of an example embodiment in the present disclosure to
provide a playset that employs chair covers that may be adapted to any existing
household chair while providing a consistent play experience. Accordingly, the
chair covers have an upper portion that extends over the chair back and employs
groups of ties to adapt to chair backs having different heights, widths, and
thicknesses. Rigid plates are employed in the upper portion and lower portion to
maintain the stature of the playset, independent of the dimensions of the chair
seat and chair back.
[ooi1] It is another aspect of an example embodiment in the present disclosure to
provide a playset that realistically depicts kitchen items and appliances.
Accordingly, the chair covers include both aesthetic and operable attachments
that simulate the appearance and actions of their real-life counterparts to provide
a fun and engaging play experience for the child.
[0012]  Accordingly, the present disclosure describes a chair cover playset,
including a chair cover for use with a household chair having a lower portion
having a seat and legs and an upper portion having a chair back. The chair cover
has a lower portion having a front panel, a top panel, and side panels that extend
over the lower portion of the chair. The chair cover has an upper panel and a
coextensive rear panel. The upper panel extends upwardly from the top panel,
over the chair back, and then the rear panel extends downwardly behind the chair
back. A plurality of ties secure the chair cover onto the chair by securing the
upper panel to the rear panel. The playset may also include a partial chair cover
having a full height panel that extends behind the chair and a half height panel
that extends in front of the chair back to the top of the seat.
                                            3

[0013] According to some embodiments, there is provided a combination toy and
chair cover, comprising a unitary or integrally attached piece of cloth material,
preferably a durable material, having various items fixed e.g., sewn to it to provide
a three dimensional look and feel, and at least one of the various items being
operable to open and close, the material covering or substantially covering a
chair, preferably an armless chair, and including rigid members which fit into slots
and/or pouches formed in the material. The material may fold up into no more
than a space of about seventeen inches long, twelve inches wide, and two inches
thick, preferably including the rigid members. The toy and chair cover may
represent a kitchen sink, a kitchen counter, a kitchen oven/stove and a kitchen
refrigerator and/or other appliance. In some embodiments, a method of folding up
and/or unfolding the combination toy and chair cover is provided. In some
embodiments a method of fixing the combination toy and chair cover to a chair to
cover the chair and create the toy is provided.
[0014] In accordance with some embodiments, there is a children's toy that is in a
form of a chair cover. Generally, the chair cover may be one elongated piece of
fabric, with various three dimension items fixed to the fabric, and preferably there
are also rigid members to provide a more realistic and useful structure for play.
[0015] In some embodiments, the combination chair cover/toy may be a kitchen
sink, a kitchen counter, a kitchen oven/stove and a kitchen refrigerator and/or
other appliance. The fabric may be foldable into a size preferably no larger than
about seventeen inches long, twelve inches wide, and two inches thick, preferably
including the rigid members. In some embodiments, a method of covering the
chair, and/or a method of uncovering and/or folding up and optionally packaging
the chair cover/toy is provided.
[0016] The present disclosure addresses at least one of the foregoing
disadvantages. However, it is contemplated that the present disclosure may prove
useful in addressing other problems and deficiencies in a number of technical
areas. Therefore, the claims should not necessarily be construed as limited to

        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0037] FIG 1 and FIG 2 illustrate a chair cover 20, that forms a part of a chair
cover playset, shown in conjunction with a household chair 100. The chair cover
playset is configured to simulate real world items, structures, and appliances, such
as those found in a conventional kitchen, using one or more chair covers 20. The
chair covers 20 are deployed, positioned, and removably installed onto one or
more chairs 100, to thereafter provide a fun, entertaining play experience for a
child. Contextually, the chair 100 has a front 10OF and a rear 100R, which
respectively define context for recitations herein of "in front of the chair" and
"behind the chair". The chair 100 has sides 100S, and a lower portion 1OOL that
includes a seat 102 and four legs 104 extending downwardly from the seat 102
and each have a leg bottom 104 B. The seat 102 has a front 102F at the front
 10OF of the chair 100, a rear 102R at the rear 1OR of the chair 100, and a pair of
sides 102S. The seat 102 has a seat top 102T that spans substantially between
the front 102F, rear 102R, and sides 102S. The seat top 102T is generally planar
and horizontal, but may be somewhat convex, concave, and/or pitched toward the
front 102F, rear 102R, or sides 102S. The legs 104 are generally located where
each of the sides 102S of the seat 102 adjoins the front 102F or rear 102R. The
chair 100 also has a chair back 106 that extends upwardly from the seat 102 near
the seat rear 102R. The chair back 106 has a chair back top 106T, a chair back
bottom 106B, and a chair back height defined between the chair back top 106T
and chair back bottom 106B.
[0038] The chair cover 20 is made substantially of flexible fabric or textile, and
includes a lower portion 20L, and an upper portion 20U. The lower portion 20L
includes a front panel 32, a top panel 34, and a pair of side panels 36. The upper
portion 20U includes an upper panel 40 and a rear panel 42. As illustrated, the
upper panel 40 and rear panel 42 are substantially coextensive with each other
and are generally coplanar prior to being attached to the chair 100, as will be
described in further detail hereinbelow.
[0039] Referring now simultaneously to FIG 15, 16, and 17: the front panel 32 has
a top edge 32T, a pair of side edges 32S, and a bottom edge 32B; the top panel
34 has a front edge 34F, a pair of side edges 34S, and a rear edge 34R; and the
                                           8

side panels 36 each have a top edge 36T, a front edge 36F, and a bottom edge
36B. In addition, the upper panel 40 has a bottom edge 40B and a top edge 40T;
and the rear panel 42 has a top edge 42T and a bottom edge 42B. As seen in the
flattened chair cover 20 as illustrated, the front edge 34F of the top panel 34
adjoins and is attached to the top edge 32T of the front panel 34. In addition, the
side edges 34S of the top panel 34 adjoin and are attached to the top edges 36T
of the side panels 36. Further, the rear edge 34R of the top panel 34 adjoins and
is attached to the bottom edge 40B of the upper panel 40. Still further, the top
edge 40T of the upper panel 40 adjoins and is attached to the top edge 42T of the
rear panel 42.
[0040] Referring again to FIG 1 and 2, the side panels 36 are joined to the front
panel 32 by fastening each of the side edges 32S of the front panel 32 to the front
edge 36F of one of the side panels 36. Once so fastened, the lower portion 20L
of the chair cover 20 forms a rectangular prism that is closed on four sides and
open at its bottom and rear. In particular, the top panel 34 is substantially
orthogonal to the front panel 32, and the side panels 36 are substantially
orthogonal to both the front panel 32 and top panel 34 but are substantially
parallel to each other. The bottom edges 36B of the side panels 36 are
substantially aligned with the bottom edge 32B of the front panel 32. In addition,
the upper panel 40 extends orthogonal to the top panel 34, and substantially
parallel to the front panel 32. Once in this configuration, with some modification as
discussed hereinbelow, the chair cover 20 is generally a suitable configuration to
attach onto the chair 100. In particular, referring to FIG 3, the lower portion 1OOL
of the chair 100 extends within the lower portion 20L of the chair cover 20, with
the sides panels 36 extending downwardly along the sides 1OOS of the chair 100;
the front panel 32 extending in front of and downwardly from the front 102F of the
seat 102; and the upper panel 40 extending upwardly from the chair back bottom
 106B at the rear 102R of the seat 102, in front of the chair back 106. The bottom
edges 32B, 36B of the front panel 32 and side panels 36 extend near the leg
bottoms 104B. As illustrated in FIG 3, the rear panel 42 initially continues
upwardly from the upper panel 40, but then as seen in FIG 4 is folded at the top
edges 40T, 42T of the upper panel 40 and rear panel 42 to reverse direction and
extend over the chair back top 106T so that the rear panel 42 then extends behind
                                            9

the chair 100 and the bottom edge 42B of the rear panel 42 extends near the leg
bottoms 104. The chair cover 20 is fastened to the seat by securing the upper
panel 40 to the rear panel 42 as will be described in further detail hereinbelow.
[0041] Referring again to FIG 17, the upper panel 40 and rear panel 42 has side
edges. Namely - the upper panel has a first edge 401 and a second edge 402,
and the rear panel has a first edge 421 and a second edge 422. The first edges
401, 421 are coextensive, as are the second edges 402, 422. The first edges
401, 421 extending parallel to the second edges 402, 422 and together extend
fully between the bottom edge 40B of the upper panel, past the top edges 40T,
42T of the upper panel 40 and rear panel 42, and to the bottom edge 42B of the
rear panel. A plurality of ties 50 are attached along the first edges 401, 421 and
second edges 402, 422 and each extend perpendicular thereto. The ties are thin,
flexible fabric strips that are attached to one of the edges 401, 402, 421, 422, and
each have a free end 50A. In particular, a set of first upper ties 501 are attached
to the first edge 401 of the upper panel 40; a set of second upper ties 502 are
attached to the second edge 402 of the upper panel 40; a set of first rear ties 521
are attached to the first edge 421 of the rear panel 42; and a set of second rear
ties 522 are attached to the second edge 422 of the rear panel 42. In the
embodiment illustrated, each set 501, 502, 521, 522 has three ties 50. Securing
the upper panel 40 to the rear panel 42 involves fastening the first upper ties 501
to the first rear ties 521 and fastening the second upper ties 502 to the second
rear ties 522. Accordingly, the ties 50 in each set 501, 502, 521, 522 are spaced
to align with each other when the chair cover 20 is deployed in the manner
previously described and shown in FIG 3 and FIG 4.
[0042] Referring to FIG 5, a kitchen sink embodiment of the chair cover 20 is
illustrated. In this embodiment, a door panel 70 is attached to the front panel 32.
As illustrated, the playset further includes rigid plates 60 that stiffen the flexible
fabric of the chair cover 20 and help it maintain its position and stature, and
provide a consistent play experience when used on chairs having different sizes
and proportions. In particular, a rigid seat plate 61 is positioned beneath the top
panel 34; a rigid upper plate 62 is positioned behind the upper panel 40; and a
door plate 63 is positioned within the door panel 70. Referring to FIG 2, the upper
                                            10

panel 40 has a front surface 40F and a rear surface 40R. A panel pocket 64 is
attached to the rear surface 40R of the upper panel 40. The panel pocket 64 may
have a flap 65 for selectively allowing access to the panel pocket 64. Referring to
 FIG 14, the panel pocket 64 is a substantially rectangular fabric panel attached to
the rear surface 40R of the upper panel 40 and is sized to contain the
substantially rectangular rigid upper plate 62 and maintain it in position between
the rear surface 40R of the upper panel 40 and the panel pocket 64. The rigid
upper plate 62 is made of a rigid material such as corrugated plastic, foam, or the
like. With the rigid upper plate 62 inserted into the panel pocket 64, now referring
to FIG 3, the panel pocket 64 positions the (now hidden) rigid upper plate 62
between the upper panel 40 and the chair back 106, where it helps maintain the
position and stature of the otherwise flexible chair cover 20. Referring again to
 FIG 2, the rigid seat plate 61 is positioned beneath the top panel 34, and as the
top panel 34 is positioned over the seat 102, the rigid seat plate 61 is thereby
positioned between the top panel 34 and the seat top 102T. The rigid seat plate
61 may be located within another panel pocket, 64A, similar to the panel pocket
64 on the upper panel 40, or may simply be freely placed on the seat top 102T as
the chair cover 20 is installed.
[0043] FIG 5, 6, and 7 illustrate the chair cover 20 in a kitchen sink embodiment.
 In particular, a simulated sink 201 is provided on the top panel 34, a simulated
window 202 is provided on the upper panel 40, and the door panel 70 is depicted
as a cabinet door 203.     The door panel 70 is substantially rectangular in shape
having a hinged end 70A and an opposite free end 70B. The hinged end 70A is
secured to the front surface 32F of the front panel 32, the free end 70B has a
fastening mechanism 72 that selectively mates with a mating fastener 74 on the
front panel 32 to maintain a closed position wherein the door panel 70
substantially parallel to the front panel 32. Note that the fastening mechanism 72
and mating fastener 74 are preferably magnets and magnetically attractive
elements, and may alternatively be hook and loop fasteners, snaps, or other
suitable fasteners. A door pocket 76 may be attached to the door panel 70 to
allow the door plate 63 to extend between the door panel 70 and door pocket 76.
The door plate 63 may have a picture frame shape, to provide the desired rigidity
for the door panel 70, and also allow the door panel 70 to have a transparent
                                            11

window 71 (see FIG 9) for allowing objects behind the door panel 70 to be viewed
through the door panel 70. As illustrated in FIG 7, a pair of storage pockets 210
are located behind the door panel 70. The storage pockets 210 as attached to the
front panel 32 on three sides, and have an open top edge 210T for accepting thin
objects and allowing them to be stored between the storage pocket 210 and the
front panel 32.
[0044] FIG 8 illustrates the chair cover 20 in a countertop embodiment. In
particular, storage pockets 210 are provided on the front panel 32 as simulated
storage drawers 212, complete with handle pulls 214. In addition, simulated
appliances 216 are provided on the upper panel 40. The simulated appliances
have a a top slot 216A adapted for allowing a thin play item 218 to be placed
downwardly between the simulated appliance 216 and the front surface 40F of the
upper panel 40. Some of the simulated appliances 216 may have a transparent
appliance window 217 adapted for viewing one of the play items 218 when placed
between the simulated appliance 216 and the front surface 40F of the upper panel
40.
[0045] Also illustrated in FIG 8 are several shelves 220 attached to the front
surface 40F of the upper panel 40. Each shelf 220 has a main portion 221 having
a pair of ends 221 E, and a pair of side brackets 222. The side brackets 222 are
made of flexible fabric and attach the main portion 221 to the front surface 40F of
the upper panel 40. The main portion 221 has an internal pocket for holding a rigid
shelf plate 66 and a rear slot 224 that provides access to the internal pocket. The
rear slot 224 ordinarily rests against the front surface 40F of the upper panel 40
when the main portion 221 extends perpendicular to the front surface 40F. The
main portion 221 of the shelf 220 may be folded upwardly against the front surface
40F by folding the flexible side brackets 222, exposing the slot 224. In particular,
when the shelf 220 is folded upwardly, the slot extends 224 downwardly and
allows the rigid shelf plate 66 to be inserted into the shelf pocket therein.
[0046] FIG 9 an FIG 10 illustrate the chair cover 20 in an oven and stove
embodiment. In particular, simulated burners 230 are provided on the top panel
34, and simulated control knobs 232 are provided on the front panel 32. The door
panel 70 attached to the front panel 32 is a simulated oven door 234, and a
                                           12

simulated microwave door 236 is hingedly attached to the front surface 40F of the
upper panel 40.
[0047] FIG 11, 12, 13, and 18 illustrate a partial chair cover 80 that may be
included as part of the chair cover playset. The partial chair cover 80 includes a

ice maker 240 is attached to and protrudes outwardly from the full height panel 82.
[0049] In accordance with some embodiments, there is a children's toy that is in a
form of a chair cover. Generally, the chair cover may be one elongated piece of
                                            13

fabric, with various three dimension items fixed to the fabric, and preferably there
may also be rigid members to provide a more realistic and useful structure for
play. Some examples views of exemplary combination chair covers for kitchen
items/appliances may be as shown in some of the accompanying figures. In some
embodiments, these exemplary versions may be a kitchen sink, a kitchen counter,
a kitchen oven/stove and a kitchen refrigerator. Each item may be made primarily
of a large piece of fabric ("primary fabric"), cut as shown in some of the
accompany figures showing unfolded schematic/plan views of each appliance
according to some embodiments. The primary fabric is preferably durable, such as
canvas. Other fabrics such as denim, drapery fabric and/or upholstery fabric
and/or other heavy cotton or synthetic fabrics may also be used. For various
pockets, pouches and mounting pieces, mentioned in the instructions, may be
plastic and/or Velcro@ and/or fabric and/or a combination sewn to the primary
fabric. The various ties mentioned below may be, e.g., nylon or other suitable
fabric sewn to the primary fabric. Wherever "sewn" is mentioned herein, other
mechanism of affixation may be used. In addition, wherever plastic or fabric
pockets or sleeves or the like are mentioned herein, such pockets or sleeves may
be any suitable material, and/or may be located in other positions. Also, while
magnets are referred to herein for closure mechanisms and are preferred for such
mechanisms, placement of the magnets and/or number of the magnets may vary
to achieve the same functions. In addition, other closure mechanisms, although
less preferred, may be used. The fabric may be foldable into a size preferably no
larger than about seventeen inches long, twelve inches wide, and two inches
thick, preferably including the rigid members. Where rigid members are larger,
when deployed, then the seventeen by twelve length and width, they are
preferably formed so as to be foldable and unfoldable. Wherever rigid foam
support pieces or the like are mentioned herein, such pieces may be foam core,
cardboard and/or other materials providing the desired rigidity. Because foam core
is so light, and provides some depth, it is preferred in some embodiments. A
method of covering the chair, and/or a method of uncovering and/or folding up and
optionally packaging the chair cover/toy may be provided. Folding and unfolding is
provided as well as assembly instructions.

[oo5] It is understood that when an element is referred hereinabove as being
"on" another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening
elements may be present therebetween. In contrast, when an element is referred
to as being "directly on" another element, there are no intervening elements
present.
[oo5] Moreover, any components or materials can be formed from a same,
structurally continuous piece or separately fabricated and connected.
[0052]   It is further understood that, although ordinal terms, such as, "first,"
"second," "third," are used herein to describe various elements, components,
regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers
and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used
to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another
element, component, region, layer or section. Thus, "a first element,"
"component," "region," "layer" or "section" discussed below could be termed a
second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the
teachings herein.
[0053] Spatially relative terms, such as "beneath," "below," "lower," "above,"
"upper" and the like, are used herein for ease of description to describe one
element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated
in the figures. It is understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to
encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to
the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is
turned over, elements described as "below" or "beneath" other elements or
features would then be oriented "above" the other elements or features. Thus, the
example term "below" can encompass both an orientation of above and below.
The device can be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations)
and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.
[0054] Example embodiments are described herein with reference to cross
section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments. As
such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of
manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, example
                                             15

embodiments described herein should not be construed as limited to the particular
shapes of regions as illustrated herein, but are to include deviations in shapes that
result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region illustrated or
described as flat may, typically, have rough and/or nonlinear features. Moreover,
sharp angles that are illustrated may be rounded. Thus, the regions illustrated in
the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate
the precise shape of a region and are not intended to limit the scope of the
present claims.
[oo55] In conclusion, herein is presented a chair cover playset. The disclosure is
illustrated by example in the drawing figures, and throughout the written
description. It should be understood that numerous variations are possible, while
adhering to the inventive concept. Such variations are contemplated as being a
part of the present disclosure.
