      A    method       for      cardiac         treatment,         which        includes
acquiring       and   saving       an  initial           map  of   a   chamber        of  a
heart   of a patient in an initial                      ablation procedure, with
locations      of   ablation       lesions        marked     on   the    initial      map.
In  preparation        for   a    redo    ablation         procedure,         subsequent
to  the   initial      ablation       procedure,           a  current       map    of   the
chamber    is     acquired,       the   initial          map  is   registered         with
the   current       map,      and     the       locations        of    the       ablation

                  CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
         This        application            claims         the       benefit         of      U.S.
Provisional            Patent     Application            62/447,936,        filed      January
19,    2017, which is            incorporated herein by reference.
                                FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         The     present        invention        relates        generally         to   systems
and        methods           for    invasive            medical         treatment,             and
specifically to tracking and evaluating such treatment.
                                         BACKGROUND
         Minimally-invasive                  intracardiac              ablation        is      the
treatment           of    choice     for     various         types      of    arrhythmias.
To     perform           such     treatment,            the      physician         typically
inserts          a    catheter      through           the     vascular         system        into
the     heart,        brings      the    distal        end     of    the   catheter          into
contact         with       myocardial          tissue       in      areas      of    abnormal
electrical            activity,         and      then      energizes         one      or    more
electrodes             at     or   near       the      distal        end    in      order        to
create tissue necrosis.
         A     number         of   systems          for     intracardiac             ablation
therapy         are      commercially         available,           such    as     the   CARTO@
system          offered         by    Biosense            Webster         Inc.        (Irvine,
California).                 CARTO   tracks        the     position        and     operating
parameters             of     the   distal          end      of      the   catheter            and
displays           this      information          electronically              on    a   three
dimensional              (3D)    anatomical          map     of     the   heart.          CARTO
enables           the      system       operator           to     electronically               tag
locations           that      have   been       ablated        on     the   map     and      thus
to keep track of the progress of the procedure.
                                                     1

           These         sorts        of      capabilities                 are       described,              for
example,           in      U.S.     Patent          8,900,225,             whose        disclosure              is
incorporated                   herein            by       reference.                     This          patent
describes             a     method        for     performing              a    medical           procedure
in which a probe                    is      brought          into contact with an organ
in      a     body         of    a     patient.                 A     map      of      the        organ         is
displayed,               and     the       location            of     the     probe         relative           to
the       map      is       tracked.              A     therapy           is      applied           via      the
probe        at    multiple           tissue         sites         in    the      organ        with which
the      probe         is     brought          into        contact.              Stability             of    the
contact           between           the        probe          and       the      tissue           sites         is
assessed            while          applying             the        therapy.                 The      map        is
automatically                   marked,           responsively                  to      the        assessed
stability,               to    indicate            the      tissue         sites         at     which        the
therapy was applied.
           Atrial            fibrillation                    (AF)         often            stems           from
arrhythmogenic                    electrical                  activity              originating                 in
areas           in      and       around            the        pulmonary              veins.               This
condition can                 be    treated by a                 pulmonary vein                  isolation
 (PVI)       procedure,             in      which        a    catheter           is     inserted           into
the       left      atrium          and       ablates           myocardial             tissue          around
the         ostia           of     the         pulmonary               veins,           typically              by
applying           radio        frequency             (RF)       energy        to     create         lesions
in      the       tissue.                The       operating              physician              uses        the
catheter              to       create            multiple              overlapping                 ablation
lesions, which                  form wide circumferential ablation                                        (WCA)
lines         in      the      tissue           around          the      pulmonary              veins        and
thus         interrupt             any        conductive               pathways            between           the
pulmonary veins                   and the           atrium.            This       treatment can                be
carried           out,        for       example,             using        the        above-mentioned
CARTO         system,           which         is     capable            of     both         mapping          the
shape         of      and       electrical               activity            in       the      heart         and
                                                             2

applying         the      RF      energy        to    ablate           the    tissue.        When
successful,           PVI     by RF        ablation          (RFA)       completely       blocks
the       arrhythmogenic                  currents           and         thus     permanently
resolves the AF.
         In many cases, however, AF recurs                                after treatment,
sometimes          long        after        the      date        of     the    original       PVI
procedure.               This       sort      of     recurrence            of   AF    has    been
shown       to    be      related          in     a   significant             percentage        of
patients          to         recurrence              of        conduction            from     the
pulmonary          veins          to     the      left       atrium.            To    treat    and
resolve        the      recurrence,             the    physician           must     once    again
insert a catheter into the left atrium and attempt to close
the conduction gaps                  (CGs)     that    exist        in   the WCA lines       with
additional, new RFA lesions in the appropriate locations                                        so
as to completely isolate the PVs.                               This sort of repeat RFA
procedure is known in the art as "redo ablation."
                                              SUMMARY
         Embodiments             of      the       present           invention        that    are
described         hereinbelow              provide        methods          and    systems     for
performing           ablation            procedures,             and      particularly        for
improving the ease and efficacy of redo ablation.
         There     is     therefore          provided,           in     accordance      with    an
embodiment           of      the       invention,             a      method       for    cardiac
treatment, which includes acquiring and saving an                                        initial
map     of   a  chamber          of    a   heart      of     a   patient       in   an   initial
ablation        procedure,            with       locations           of    ablation      lesions
marked      on    the      initial         map.        In      preparation         for    a  redo
ablation        procedure,             subsequent          to      the     initial      ablation
procedure,        a     current        map     of   the    chamber         is   acquired,     the
initial       map     is    registered            with    the       current      map,    and  the
locations         of      the      ablation         lesions          from     the    registered
initial map are marked and displayed on the current map.

          In     some          embodiments,                registering           the      initial           map
includes           identifying               at   least          one   anatomical          landmark          in
both       the      initial            map     and      the       current     map,      and        aligning
the      at    least         one       landmark          identified         in     the     initial          map
with      a    position            of      the    at      least      one   landmark           identified
in      the      current            map.           In       a    disclosed        embodiment,               the
chamber         is      a    left        atrium       of      the    heart,      and    the       at     least
one       landmark             includes            a      carina        between        superior             and
inferior pulmonary veins connecting to the left atrium.
          Additionally                    or       alternatively,                 displaying                the
locations            of     the       ablation          lesions        includes        superimposing
on     the     current            map      wide      circumferential                ablation             (WCA)
lines        produced               in     the     initial           ablation       procedure,              and
the      redo        ablation              procedure             includes       ablating             further
tissue        in     the       chamber          at    sites        chosen      to    close        at    least
one conduction gap in the WCA.
          In      a       disclosed              embodiment,             the      method           includes
sensing         electrical               activity           in    the   chamber        of    the       heart,
and      displaying               an       indication             of   the     sensed         electrical
activity            on      the       current         map,        showing       a   conduction              gap
between             the           ablation             lesions.                 Additionally                 or
alternatively,                     the       redo          ablation        procedure               includes
ablating           further            tissue        in       the    chamber,        and      the       method
includes           marking            and      displaying            on   the     current           map     the
locations of                further ablation                    lesions    created by ablating
the      further            tissue          together            with     the     ablation            lesions
from the registered initial map.
          In       some          embodiments,                  the     ablation          lesions            are
produced by application of                              radio frequency               (RF) energy to
myocardial             tissue           in    the      chamber        of   the      heart,          and     the
initial map and the current map are                                      acquired by inserting
a     probe        into         the        chamber          of     the    heart,        and        tracking

the heart.
      There         is     also        provided,            in       accordance            with      an
embodiment           of     the       invention,              a      system          for     cardiac
treatment,          including           a   probe         configured              for     insertion
into   a    chamber       of    a   heart       of     a   patient.              A   processor       is
configured        to     receive         an   initial          map       of    a    chamber       of   a

program      instructions are stored, which instructions, when
read   by     a   processor,             cause     the      processor             to    receive      an
initial       map      of     a    chamber          of      a    heart          of     a    patient,
acquired in          an initial           ablation procedure, with locations
of  ablation          lesions        marked        on     the       initial          map,     and    to
acquire a current map of the                        chamber in preparation for a
redo      ablation          procedure,             subsequent               to       the     initial
ablation      procedure,           and     to   register            the     initial        map    with

                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
                                           OVERVIEW
       One     of     the     challenges         in     a    redo    ablation         procedure
is   to find the precise locations of the WCA lines made in
                                                     6

the      previous           procedure,           so    that        new   RFA      lesions          can    be
placed         exactly         where        necessary          in     order       to     achieve         re
isolation            of     the    pulmonary          veins.           For     this      purpose,         it
is      desirable             that      data        acquired           during         the       previous
mapping          and       ablation         procedure           be     available           during        the
redo       ablation,           and     particularly              that     these        earlier         data
be      incorporated              into        the     map      of      the     atrium          that      the
physician            is    currently          viewing        while       performing             the    redo
ablation.                Although        some       existing           mapping         tools        permit
the     user       to     superimpose           and     register         different           images       of
the     heart,          they do        not     enable        the      physician          to    view      and
make       use     of     the   mapping         and     ablation         data,        including          the
WCA     lines,          from a       previous        procedure           on    the      current        map.
The      inability           to    incorporate            the      previously-acquired                   map
and        ablation            data       in       the       current          map        results          in
unnecessary               repetitions             of    RFA        and    prolongs            procedure
time.
          More         generally,             physicians             encounter            these        same
sorts        of       challenges            in     treating           various         other         rhythm
disorders           originating            in different chambers of the heart,
such       as     ventricular           tachycardia               (VT) .       Inability            to   use
the       mapping            and      ablation           data        acquired           in      previous
sessions creates                  significant limitations.                         These data can
be      crucial           in    the      redo       cases          for    accurate            targeting
and/or evaluation of the previous ablation.
          Embodiments               of      the      present            invention            that        are
described herein provide novel techniques,                                         implemented in
software,           for registering and superimposing a previously
acquired map and RFA data onto                              the current map that                      is  in
use     by     the      physician          in    a   redo      ablation          procedure.              The
registration                  and       superimposition                  rely          on       accurate
alignment            of     the    previous         and      current        maps,        so    that      the
                                                          7

inner      surfaces         of     the     heart         chamber       in    the     previous          and
current      maps       are      precisely            registered           with      one     another,
even     when    a   long       period          (possibly on            the    order      of     a   year
or    more)     has       elapsed          between           the    previous           and     current
procedures.
        The     alignment            is      typically            based,        inter      alia,        on
matching         anatomical               landmarks,              such       as      the       carinae
between      superior           and     inferior           pulmonary         veins,       which        the
inventors        have       found       to     facilitate           accurate         and     reliable
registration             of        the        left          atrium,         or       other         fixed
anatomical         landmarks            in other arrhythmias and chambers                               of
the     heart.           For        example,            in     other       cardiac         chambers,
anatomical         landmarks             such      as      the    coronary         sinus,        bundle
of    His,    or    superior           and      inferior          venae      cavae       can     be   use
individually           or     in     combination              for    map     registration              and
alignment.              Thus,         although             the     embodiments             that        are
illustrated          in       the      figures           relate        specifically            to     RFA
treatment        of    atrial         fibrillation              in    the    left       atrium,        the
principles          of      the      present            invention          may      similarly           be
applied      in    treatment            of     other       conditions          in    the    atria       or
ventricles, such as ventricular tachycardia.
         Furthermore,               although              the      embodiments             described
hereinbelow relate specifically to RFA, the principles                                                  of
the     present       invention            may      similarly          be    applied,          mutatis
mutandis,         in      facilitating                redo       procedures           using        other
ablation        modalities            that        are      known      in    the     art,      such      as
ultrasonic ablation or cryo-ablation.
        Automatic                registration,                     superimposition                     and
visualization of previous map data and RFA lesion data on
the     current      map       in     this       manner        eliminates           any     need       for
user     involvement            in     reduplication               of    these      data      and     has
been     found to facilitate and shorten redo ablation times.
                                                          8

In    effect,          the      redo     ablation           becomes          an     extension          of    the
previous           procedure.                The      ability          to      view        the      previous
lesion         set      directly           on     the      current           map       also      helps       the
physician            to      understand            the      reasons          for       the     failure         of
the        previous                procedure             and         thus            improve            future
treatments.

CARTO         system,           with        suitable           additions               to     the       system
software.                  System        20       comprises            a      probe,          such        as     a
catheter 24,               and a control              console 34.                In the embodiment
described            hereinbelow,               catheter           24     is     used        in     ablating
sites       of     arrhythmias             in     one      or    more       chambers           of    a    heart
26 of a patient 30.
         An      operator             22,      such       as      a    cardiologist,                  inserts
catheter           24    through         the vascular               system         of patient             30   so
that      the      distal          end    of    the      catheter           enters         a    chamber        of
heart       26.        Operator           22    advances           the      catheter           so    that      an
electrode            28      at     the    distal         tip      of    the        catheter          engages
endocardial              tissue        at     desired          ablation            sites.           Catheter
24    is    typically             connected by              a   suitable            connector          at    its
proximal           end       to    console        34,      and      specifically               to    a    radio
frequency             (RF)       generator          36,       which        generates             RF     energy
for       transmission                 via        catheter            24       to       electrode            28.
Operator           22    actuates          RF generator               36     to     ablate       tissue        at
and/or around suspected sites of arrhythmia in the heart.
         In this pictured embodiment,                                system 20 uses magnetic
position sensing                    to determine position coordinates of                                     the
                                                            9

distal          end     of     catheter            24       inside       heart      26.         For    this
purpose,           a   driver         circuit          38      in     console      34    drives      field
generators            32    to generate magnetic fields within the body
of    patient          30.         Typically,              field       generators          32     comprise
coils,          which        are      placed          below          the    patient's           torso       at
fixed,          known       positions.                These           coils    generate          magnetic
fields         in a predefined working volume that                                   contains heart
26.          A    magnetic            field         sensor            (not    shown)        within       the
distal         end of catheter 24                    generates           electrical signals                 in
response to these magnetic                             fields.           A   signal processor 40
processes             these          signals            in        order       to     determine           the
position           coordinates              of      the       distal       end    of     catheter        24,
typically              including                both           location          and        orientation
coordinates,               and      tracking          these          coordinates          in    order       to
create         a   map of        the      interior            surface       of   the heart.            This
method         of    position           sensing           is      implemented         in     the    above
mentioned            CARTO         system          and       is      well    known       in     the    art.
Alternatively                or     additionally,                   system     20    may      use    other
methods          of    position            sensing           that      are    known       in    the    art,
such as ultrasonic or electrical impedance-based methods.
          In addition,               catheter 24 may comprise a force                               sensor
 (not      shown)        in    its      distal        end,         for measuring           the     contact
force       between          the     catheter           tip       and the wall           of    heart     26.
The       SmartTouchTM             catheter           developed            by    Biosense          Webster
Inc.       for the CARTO system offers this                                  sort of capability.
A    catheter           of     this        sort      is       described,          for      example,         in
U.S.        Patent        Application               Publication             2011/0130648,            whose
disclosure             is      incorporated                  herein       by     reference.              The
force measurement                    is useful            in ensuring that electrode 28
is     in     sufficiently               firm       contact           with    the     heart       wall      to
effectively               transfer             RF     energy           and     ablate         the    heart
tissue.              The      force         measurements                can     also       be     used     by

processor           40     in      tagging        ablation          sites,        as      described
below.
          Processor          40     in    console         34     typically           comprises          a
general-purpose               computer          processor,          with       suitable           front
end      and     interface            circuits        for      receiving           signals          from
catheter 24           and for controlling and receiving inputs                                      from
the      other components               of console          34.       Processor 40             may be
programmed           in     software        to     carry       out     the     functions            that
are      described herein.                 The     software may be               downloaded           to
processor           40     in     electronic          form,        over      a    network,           for
example,           or      it       may      be      provided,           alternatively                or
additionally,              on    tangible,         non-transitory              media,        such     as
optical,         magnetic           or   electronic            memory      media.             Further
alternatively               or      additionally,               some      or       all       of      the
functions of processor 40                       may be carried out by dedicated
or programmable digital hardware components.
          Based      on    the      signals       received         from     catheter           24    and
other       components            of     system       20,      processor           40     drives        a
display          42       to      present         operator           22     with         a      three
dimensional              (3D)      map     44     of     heart        26.         The       map      may
indicate          cardiac         electrophysiological                   activity          measured
by      catheter         24,      as    well      as     providing          visual          feedback
regarding          the     position         of    the     catheter        in     the      patient's
body       and    status         information           and     guidance          regarding           the
procedure that              is    in progress.             Other parameters that may
be      measured         by     catheter         24     and      by     other       elements          of
system 20          and may be shown on display 42                          can      include, for
example,          contact         force      between          the     catheter           and      heart
tissue,        electrical            impedance         of     the    heart       tissue,          local
temperature, and RF power delivered through the catheter.
          Processor           40       assesses          the       parameters              that       it
receives         from system            20   as    indicators          of    the      adequacy        of

ablation     at     each       treated          site     in     heart       26.       When     the
ablation      parameters                at      a     given        site       meet       certain
predefined criteria,                the processor automatically places                            a
mark   46,    also        referred           to     as   a     "tag, "       on   map      44   to
indicate the        site.         The processor may vary the appearance
of  marks     46      (such       as     their        color)       in     response        to   the
parameters       at      each       site.           The     criteria          for    automatic
marking    of     the      ablation          sites      may      be    preconfigured,           or
they   may,       alternatively                 or     additionally,             be      set    by
operator    22,      typically            using       user     interface         controls       50
and   on-screen          menus.              Additionally             or     alternatively,
operator    22     can     use     controls          50  to     instruct        processor       to
place marks 46 at ablation sites.
      Although        in     the     illustrated           embodiment,           catheter       24
is  manipulated           manually           by     operator         22,     system       20   may
alternatively           or       additionally              comprise           an     automated
mechanism      (not      shown)         for      maneuvering           and    operating        the
catheter     within           the       body        of   patient           30.         In     such
embodiments,        processor            40     generates         a    control      input      for
controlling         the      motion          of      catheter          24    based       on    the
signals    provided            by     the      magnetic         field        sensor       in   the
catheter     and       other         system         parameters,             such     as     those
mentioned above.

during   an      initial           PVI       treatment          to     treat      AF,      and    a
subsequent      redo ablation               treatment,          in order to resolve a
recurrence of the AF.                    These figures            are     reproductions of
actual   maps,        taken        from       procedures          performed         about      one
year apart.          The     procedures were               performed using a                CARTO

system, and maps                 60 and 62 were acquired automatically by
the       system         as     the        operating             physician          manipulated                 a
mapping           and     ablation           catheter            within         the     heart.               The
markings           shown      on     map       60      were       likewise         created           by      the
CARTO        system and          include           Visitagm marks                46    (which appear
in    the       figures       as    small         balls        superimposed             on      the      heart

circumferential                 WCA         lines         that        were        ablated           by       the
physician           in    the     initial            treatment,            around       the       ostia       of
the     pulmonary veins.                     No      such      marks        appear       initially            on
map       62,      thus     making           it       difficult           for      operator             22    to
identify           during       the      redo        procedure           which      locations              were
already ablated in the previous procedure.
          Fig.         4     is       a       flow           chart          that       schematically
illustrates              a    method           for       performing             a    redo          ablation
procedure, while                 automatically transferring                            the       locations
of    RFA       lesions       from        a   previous           map       (such    as      map       60)     to
the     current         map     (such        as      map      62),     in     accordance            with      an
embodiment             of   the      invention.                 The      method       is      described,
for     the      sake     of    concreteness                and     clarity,        with         reference
to    the      elements         of    system           20     (Fig.      1)    and   to       a    sequence
of    example          maps     of    the      left        atrium,         shown     in      Figs.        2,    3
and 5-7.            Alternatively, as noted earlier, the method can
be    carried          out using          other         sorts      of     ablation         systems           and
can be applied to other chambers of the heart, as well.

          At      a    preliminary               step         70,     in     an     initial             ablation
procedure, prior to                        the present redo                  ablation,              console 34
acquired           and     saved          an    initial           map     of    the     heart           chamber,
with      locations           of      RFA      lesions           marked       in    the       initial          map,
as    shown         in    Fig.        2,      for     example.             Before         beginning             the
subsequent             redo ablation procedure,                            console 34              acquires        a
current          map     of    the        chamber,            such      as    map     62,        illustrated
in Fig.          3, at a map acquisition step                                72.      Console             34   then
registers            the    initial            map with            the    current         map,         at    a  map
registration step                    74.        This        registration            can be performed
by    identifying              one        or    more         anatomical           landmarks              in    both
the      initial         map       and        the       current         map,       and      aligning            the
landmarks              identified                in         the       initial          map           with       the
positions of              the same             landmarks identified in the                                current
map.
          Fig.       5  is    a     schematic              representation              of      maps         60  and
62     (from        Figs.      2     and       3),      illustrating              landmarks              76,    78,
80    that        are    used        in      registering              the     maps,        in       accordance
with an embodiment                      of the          invention.              Maps       60      and      62  are
shown       side by         side         in    Fig.        5   as    an    aid     to visualization.
In       this        example,               the       carinae           between            superior             and
inferior           pulmonary            veins         82      on    the    left       and       right         sides
of    the      left      atrium           serve        as     landmarks          76    and        78.        These
carinae            may       conveniently                    be      found         automatically                 by
geometrical             analysis             of    maps        60    and      62,    with          or    without
operator            assistance.                     Landmark            80      is     chosen             in    the
present          example         to be         the      apex       of    an    isosceles             triangle,
with         its       base         drawn          between            landmarks              76        and      78.
Console          34    aligns         landmarks              76,    78    and     80    in     maps         60  and
62     and        thus       registers               the       initial          map      with           the     map
surface in the current map.

      Returning            now      to   Fig.        4,      based        on     the        registration
between    the      initial           and     current          maps       at     step         74,     console

in  the present            example)           the     locations             of     the       RFA      lesions
from   the    initial             map,      at     a     marking           step         84.          In    this
manner,    the      Visitag           and/or        other         RFA marks               corresponding
to  the   WCA      lines          from     the       initial           map      are        displayed           at
the  precise         corresponding                 locations             on     the        current         map.
Operator     22      manipulates               catheter            24     and      actuates             system
20  to   ablate          further         tissue           in     the      left        atrium,            at    an
ablation     step        90.         The    operator             (or system 20,                   operating
automatically)            can use         the markings                 on the current                   map to
choose    ablation            sites       in      proximity              to    the        previous           RFA
lesions,     and        specifically                to      close         any       gaps        that       have
opened in the WCA lines that were ablated previously.
      Figs.      6    and        7    are     schematic             representations                    of    map
62,   seen     from          two       different              angles,           illustrating                 the
operations      carried            out     in     steps         84    and      90,       in     accordance
with an embodiment of the                        invention.               Map       62 now includes
both    marks          86,         representing                  ablation               lesions            made
previously        in       the       initial          ablation            procedure,                and      new
marks   92   at      the       sites       ablated           in     the      current           procedure.
Marks   86    are       transferred               to     map       62     from        map       60     on    the
basis   of    the         registration               performed             at       step        74,      while
marks    92    are         added        to      map        62      by     console              34     as     the
corresponding sites are ablated in step 90.
      Figs.      6    and       7    also       show       an     electrical               activity          map

System     20      acquires             this         electrical                activity              map       by
sensing     electrical                activity           in      the      left         atrium,           using
catheter      24      or       another           sensing            catheter               (not       shown).
Electrical       activity              map      88      gives         an     indication                of    the

electrical          activity           in    the    atrial        wall,       which        is   useful,
together         with      marks          86    showing         past        RFA      locations,       in
visualizing the locations                        of gaps         in the WCA lines,                where
arrhythmogenic              electrical            activity          "leaks        through."          The
operator          thus      can      create        new      RFA      lesions          at      locations
that        are    chosen         in       order       to     close        the      gaps       and   can
observe the effect of                      these new lesions                  (indicated by the
corresponding             marks        92)     on   the      electrical            activity        shown
in map 88.
                                        CLINICAL RESULTS
          The    inventors          performed           a   clinical           study       to   examine
the       efficacy         of      utilizing             the      present          techniques         in
reducing         procedure           and      RFA     time      in      redo      PVI.         Software
running        on   the CARTO             system was           used      in    incorporation          of
a previously-acquired map and RFA lesion marks for use in
the current active map.
           Fifty     patients             (Pts)     presenting              for      redo      RFA   for
recurrent atrial                fibrillation were enrolled in the                                study.
Group        (GR)     1    included           23    Pts      who      had      prior        maps    that
could be         merged       into the          current         map.         GR 2      included the
27      Pts      without          available            prior         maps.             Both      groups
underwent           CARTO         3D       mapping         of      the       left        atrium      and
pulmonary veins to                  create an anatomical                      structural shell.
In     GR     1,    the      prior         map    was      merged          into       the      current,
active         map.          Electrical             activity            maps        (specifically,
activation          maps)      were        created        to localize            conduction         gaps
 (CGs),       and focal RFA was delivered only to target the CGs
on      the     WCA     lines        in      order        to     achieve          pulmonary         vein
isolation           (PVI).             In     GR     2,     standard            methods         for   CG
localization and guiding RFA to achieve PVI were used.
                                                        16

      In both groups the              following data were collected and
compared:     RFA        time      (RFA-T),      duration           to   complete       RFA
(RFA-D),   and       total      procedure      duration            (TP-D)   to     achieve
PVI per PV pair            (PVP).     The TP-D is defined as the                    sum of
mapping time and RFA-D.
      Results:        Group       1   had   a     statistically            significant
reduction of the measured procedure parameters                                (minutes),
