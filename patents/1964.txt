                                          BACKGROUND
[0001]      Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general
knowledge in the field.
[0002]      Endotracheal intubation provides the current preferred method for control of the
airway for mechanical ventilation. The process involves passing an endotracheal tube (ETT)
through the mouth, past the tongue, and to and through the vocal cords and larynx to seal the
airway. This protects the openness of the airway and protects the airway from aspiration of
gastric contents, foreign substances, or secretions.
[0003]      Traditional laryngoscopes rely on opening the upper airway to provide a direct line of
sight from the medical practitioner's eye to the larynx. Subsequent developments in
laryngoscopes utilized fiberoptic bundles, sometimes coupled to video displays. More recently,
laryngoscopes with video cameras have made it possible to display the image of the airway
anatomy from a remote position, and in some instances allow the intubator to identify the
relevant anatomical landmarks without repositioning the patient. This technology reduces the
past problem of difficult intubation when the glottis entrance cannot be adequately seen and
further reduces the likelihood of infection by medical personnel being unduly close to the nose
and mouth of the patient can be avoided.
[0004]      Unfortunately, image quality and consistency have reduced the utility of video
laryngoscopes and have caused many practitioners to revert to traditional, direct view
laryngoscopes.

              DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[0018]       The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same
reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the
following detailed description does not limit the invention.
[0019]       Several embodiments of a video-based intubation laryngoscope and system are
described that allow for examination of the upper airway during intubation. The system employs
video laryngoscope embodiments configured to view a patient's glottis, reposition the patient's
epiglottis, view the glottic aperture and convey video images of the patient's upper airway
anatomy including the glottis and/or glottic aperture and surrounding area to a video monitor
viewable by the laryngoscope user.
[0020]       Embodiments of the laryngoscope include both single-use (i.e., disposable) and
reusable laryngoscope blades that include image capturing and lighting elements. The blade is
used to reposition the epiglottis by engagement of the patient's vallecula, or alternatively, directly
lifting the epiglottis to reveal the glottic aperture. During and after insertion of the blade, into the
patient's upper airway, images obtained from the image capturing elements are conveyed to a
video monitor viewable by the laryngoscope user via a data cable. Improved intubation speed
and accuracy are accomplished by providing unobstructed, real time or "live" views that are
immediately viewable on the video monitor.
[0021]       Consistent with embodiments described herein, the laryngoscope blade, the data
cable, and the video monitor may each include logic components configured to enable image
data to be exchanged between the image capturing element and the video monitor in an efficient
and optimized manner.
                                                   -4-

[0022]       In exemplary embodiments, the laryngoscope blade may include logical components
for authenticating the blade with other components in the system (e.g., the video monitor and/or
data cable) and logging use of the laryngoscope blade (e.g., number of times used, dates/times,
etc), and for negotiating with other components in the laryngoscope system (e.g., the blade and
the video monitor) to determine which component has the most up-to-date software, which may
include optimized camera settings and other instructions relevant to the particular laryngoscope
blade.
[0023]       In one exemplary embodiment relating to disposable laryngoscope blades, one or
more components of the image capturing element may be included within the data cable, thus
rendering the remaining image capturing components in the laryngoscope blade less expensive,
which is particularly advantageous for a single use device. In such an embodiment, the data cable
may include one or more logical components configured to identify when a laryngoscope blade
has been connected, which blade has been connected (e.g., type of blade, particular blade, etc.),
and to negotiate with other components in the laryngoscope system (e.g., the blade and the video
monitor) to determine which component has a most up-to-date software, which may include
optimized camera settings and other instructions relevant to the identified laryngoscope blade.
[0024]       In other embodiments, such as reusable laryngoscope blades, the logical components
of the data cable may be integrated within the laryngoscope blade and negotiation may take place
between the laryngoscope blade and the video monitor.
[0025]       As briefly described above, exemplary embodiments of the laryngoscope system
facilitate the exchange of optimized camera settings between system components. As described
in detail below, such optimized camera settings may be specific to each type of laryngoscope
blade and may enable the video camera elements within the laryngoscope blade to capture
                                               -5-

images having a reduced amount of far field dimming in the event that a portion of the patient's
anatomy partially obscures the camera view. This allows practitioners to ascertain the relevant
anatomy, even where such anatomy is the far field of the image.
[0026]      Fig. 1 illustrates a video laryngoscope system 100 consistent with implementations
described herein. As shown, video laryngoscope system 100 comprises a laryngoscope blade
102, a data cable 104, and a video monitor 106. Fig. 2A is an exploded front perspective view of
a single-use laryngoscope blade 102 configured in accordance with embodiments described
herein. Figs. 2B-2E are an assembled front perspective view, side view, front view, and rear view
of blade 102, respectively.
[0027]      As shown in Figs. 1-2E, laryngoscope blade 102 includes a handle portion 108, a
blade portion 110, a distal tip 112, a camera module 114, a light source module 116, a flexible
printed circuit board (PCB) 118, and a cable interface 120.
[0028]      During use, distal tip 112 is used for lifting the epiglottis or for engaging the vallecula
of a patient to lift the epiglottis to reveal the glottic aperture. Camera module 114 and light
source module 116 are positioned on a posterior side of the blade portion 110 and are directed
towards the distal tip 112 so as to capture and transmit images of the distal tip 112 and
corresponding patient anatomy to video monitor 106 via data cable 104.
[0029]      Camera module 114 may include charge-coupled device (CCD) or Complementary
Metal Oxide Silicon (CMOS) configurations that may be placed at a point of angulation of blade
portion 110 near its midpoint to provide for advantageous positioning of camera module 114 at
some distance from the glottic opening to allow a degree of perspective and wide angle viewing.
[0030]      Light source module 116 may include a light emitting diode (LED) lighting array.
                                                    -6-

[0031]      As shown in Fig. 2A, flexible PCB 118 may be configured to couple cable interface
 120 to camera module 114 and light source module 116 and may further include or more
processors or memory devices, as described below. In other embodiments, PCB 118 may include
two or more distinct PCBs joined by wires or other elements.
[0032]      As described briefly above, in some embodiments data cable 104 may include one or
more components of the image capturing element, such as a serializer component. In such an
embodiment, the data cable 104 may further include one or more logical components configured
to identify when a laryngoscope blade has been connected, which blade has been connected, and
to negotiate with video monitor 106 to determine which of the data cable 104 and the video
monitor 106 have the most up-to-date camera settings for use during image capture. In such a
single-use blade embodiment, the combination of the data cable 104 and the laryngoscope blade
 106 may together perform functions corresponding to reusable laryngoscope.
[0033]      Video monitor 106 may provide power to and initiate image capture from
laryngoscope blade 102 via data cable 104. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, video monitor 106
may include a display 122, and a control pad 124. Practitioners (e.g., medical personnel) may
interface with video monitor 106 during use to initiate image capture, freeze a particular frame,
or adjust certain limited settings. Although not shown in the Figures, video monitor 106 may also
include a data cable interface for receiving an end of data cable 104, a battery or other power
source, and a remote monitor interface for enabling the view of display 122 to be transmitted to
one or more other display monitors.
[0034]      Fig. 3 illustrates a simplified exemplary configuration of one or more components
300 of laryngoscope system 100, such as laryngoscope 102, data cable 104, and video monitor
 106. Referring to Fig. 3, component 300 may include bus 310, a processing unit 320, a memory
                                                 -7-

330, an input device 340, an output device 350, and a communication interface 360. Bus 310
may include a path that permits communication among the components 300 of laryngoscope
system 100. In one exemplary implementation, bus 310 may include an 12C bus which supports
a master/slave relationship between components 300. As described below, in exemplary
implementations, the master and slave roles may be negotiated between the components.
[0035]      Processing unit 320 may include one or more processors, microprocessors, or
processing logic that may interpret and execute instructions. Memory 330 may include a random
access memory (RAM) or another type of dynamic storage device that may store information and
instructions for execution by processing unit 320. Memory 330 may also include a read only
memory (ROM) device (e.g., an electrically erasable and programmable ROM (EEPROM)) or
another type of static storage device that may store static information and instructions for use by
processing unit 320. In other embodiments, memory 330 may further include a solid state drive
(SDD).
[0036]      Input device 340 may include a mechanism that permits a user to input information to
laryngoscope system 100, such as a keyboard, a keypad, a mouse, a pen, a microphone, a touch
screen, voice recognition and/or biometric mechanisms, etc. Output device 350 may include a
mechanism that outputs information to the user, including a display (e.g., a liquid crystal display
(LCD)), a printer, a speaker, etc. In some implementations, a touch screen display may act as
both an input device and an output device. In the laryngoscope system 100 depicted in Fig. 1,
only video monitor 106 may be provided with input device 340 and output device 350, however
in other implementations, one or more other components of laryngoscope system 100 may
include such devices. As depicted in Fig. 1, laryngoscope blade 102 and data cable 104 may be
                                                -8-

implemented as headless devices that are not directly provided with input device 340 or output
device 350 and may receive commands from, for example, video monitor 106.
[0037]       Communication interface 360 may include one or more transceivers that
laryngoscope system 100 (e.g., video monitor 106) uses to communicate with other devices via
wired, wireless or optical mechanisms. For example, communication interface 360 may include
a modem or an Ethernet interface to a local area network (LAN) or other mechanisms for
communicating with elements in a communication network (not shown in Fig. 1). In other
embodiments, communication interface 360 may include one or more radio frequency (RF)
transmitters, receivers and/or transceivers and one or more antennas for transmitting and
receiving RF data via a communication network, such as a wireless LAN or Wi-Fi network.
[0038]       The exemplary configuration illustrated in Fig. 3 is provided for simplicity. It should
be understood that laryngoscope system 100 may include more or fewer components than
illustrated in Fig. 3. In an exemplary implementation, laryngoscope system 100 performs
operations in response to one or more processing units 320 executing sequences of instructions
contained in a computer-readable medium, such as memory 330. A computer-readable medium
may be defined as a physical or logical memory device. The software instructions may be read
into memory 330 from another computer-readable medium (e.g., a hard disk drive (HDD), SSD,
etc.), or from another device via communication interface 360. Alternatively, hard-wired
circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement
processes consistent with the implementations described herein. Thus, implementations
described herein are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.
[0039]       Fig. 4 is an exemplary functional block diagram of components implemented in a
single-use laryngoscope blade 102 in accordance with an embodiment described herein. In the
                                                 -9-

embodiment of Fig. 4, all or some of the components may be implemented by processing unit
320 executing software instructions stored in memory 330.
[0040]      As shown, laryngoscope blade 102 may include identification and authentication
logic 405, version checking logic 410, settings storage 415, data logger 420, light source logic
425, image capture logic 430, and image output logic 435.
[0041]       Identification and authentication logic 405 is configured to, upon power up of
laryngoscope blade 102, exchange identification and authentication information with data cable
104 and/or video monitor 106. For example, laryngoscope blade 102 may communicate
identification information to data cable 104 via bus 310 (e.g., the 12 C bus). In one embodiment,
the identification information may comprise information relating to the type of laryngoscope
blade 102, such as the size, application, model, etc. In other implementations, the identification
information may include information specific to the particular laryngoscope blade 102, such as
serial number or other uniquely identifying information.
[0042]       Consistent with embodiments described herein, identification and authentication logic
405 may provide the identifying information to data cable 104 and video monitor 106 for use in
determining whether laryngoscope blade 102 is authorized for use with the data cable 104 and
video monitor 106. For example, as described below, upon receipt of the identification
information from laryngoscope blade 102, the data cable 104 and/or video monitor 106 may
determine whether the laryngoscope blade 102 is authorized for use. In this manner,
unauthorized, third party laryngoscope blades may not be improperly used with the laryngoscope
system described herein.
[0043]       Furthermore, in other embodiments, identification and authentication logic 405 may
be configured to exchange usage information stored in data logger 420 with video monitor 106
                                                 - 10 -

via data cable 104. For example, data logger 420 may be configured to record details regarding
usage (e.g., power up) of the laryngoscope blade 102, such as date, time, and duration of
laryngoscope blade 102. Identification and authentication logic 405 may, during subsequent
power ups, transmit this information to video monitor 106 to for use in determining whether the
laryngoscope blade 102 may be properly used. For example, single-use blades may only be
authorized for power-up a predetermined (e.g., <5) number of times, to ensure that the blades are
not used outside of their intended purpose. For reusable blades, the usage information stored in
data logger 420 may be used to provide historical information, reconditioning recommendations,
etc. In other embodiments, the information may be used to monitor a time between uses, to
determine whether appropriate sterilization procedures have been followed.
[0044]       Version checking logic 410 is configured to, in coordination with similar logic in data
cable 104 and video monitor 106, determine which component has a most recently updated set of
camera settings. For example, because components of medical devices may not be upgradable in
the field, providing an integrated upgrade path within the separate components provides an
efficient manner for rolling out updated camera settings using only a single factory-updated
component, without requiring a dedicated field update process.
[0045]       Consistent with embodiments described herein, upon power up of system 100,
version checking logic 410 determines which of laryngoscope blade 102, data cable, 104, or
video monitor 106 maintains the most recently updated set of camera settings in settings storage
415. If laryngoscope blade 102 is not the device with the most recently updated set of camera
settings, the device having such settings may transmit the camera settings to laryngoscope blade
102 or otherwise make the settings available to image capture logic 430.
                                               - 11 -

[0046]      As described briefly above, in one embodiment, laryngoscope blade 102, data cable,
104, and video monitor 106 may be coupled via an I2C bus, which requires that only one device
be in the "master" role at any one time. Generally, since the main control of system 100 is
initiated by video monitor 106, video monitor 106 is typically in the "master" role. However,
consistent with embodiments described herein, upon system power up, each of video monitor
106, data cable 104, and/or laryngoscope blade 102 may alternatively assume the "master" role
for the purposes of sharing information regarding its set of camera settings.
[0047]      Light source logic 425 is configured to cause light source module 116 to become
illuminated in accordance with settings stored in settings storage 415 or received from video
monitor 106.
[0048]      Image capture logic 430 is configured to capture images via camera module 114
based on the most recently updated set of camera settings identified and stored in settings storage
415 and/or received from video monitor 106. The captured images are then forwarded to image
output logic 435 for relay to video monitor 106. More specifically, image capture logic 430 is
configured to receive image capture control commands from video monitor 106 via data cable
104. In response to an image capture command, image capture logic 430 captures images based
on image capture settings stored in settings storage 415. Depending on whether laryngoscope
blade 102 is a single-use or reusable blade, image output logic 435 may be integrated within
laryngoscope 102 or may include multiple components included within laryngoscope blade 102
and data cable 104.
[0049]      Fig. 5 is an exemplary functional block diagram of components implemented in a data
cable 104 in accordance with an embodiment described herein. In the embodiment of Fig. 5, all
                                                - 12 -

or some of the components may be implemented by processing unit 320 executing software
instructions stored in memory 330.
[0050]      As shown, data cable 104 may include identification and authentication logic 505,
version checking logic 510, and settings storage 515 configured similarly to identification and
authentication logic 405, version checking logic 410, and settings storage 415 described above
with respect to laryngoscope blade 102. For example, identification and authentication logic 505
may include logic for determining an identity of a connected laryngoscope blade 102. In some
implementations, identification and authentication logic 505 may be further configured to
determine whether the blade 102 is suitable for use with data cable 104.
[0051]       Version checking logic 510 includes logic for determining which of data cable 104,
video monitor 106, and/or laryngoscope blade 102 has the most up-to-date set of camera settings
corresponding to the identified laryngoscope blade 102. As described above in relation to version
checking logic 410, version checking logic 510 is similarly configured to alternatively transmit
an indication of the version of the set of camera settings stored in settings storage 515 to each of
video monitor 106 and laryngoscope blade 102 and similarly receive corresponding information
from each of video monitor 106 and laryngoscope blade 102. When it is determined that the
version of the set of camera settings stored in settings storage 515 is the most up-to-date, version
checking logic 510 may provide the settings to image capture logic 430 in laryngoscope blade
102.
[0052]       Data cable 104 may further include image processing logic 520 that performs some or
all of the image processing on images captured by camera module 114. In one embodiment,
image processing logic 520 may include a serializer and/or related logic for preparing images
captured by camera module 114 for output and display by video monitor 106.
                                                - 13 -

[0053]       Fig. 6 is an exemplary functional block diagram of components implemented in a
video monitor 106 in accordance with an embodiment described herein. In the embodiment of
Fig. 6, all or some of the components may be implemented by processing unit 320 executing
software instructions stored in memory 330.
[0054]       As shown, video monitor 106 may include identification and authentication logic 605,
version checking logic 610, settings storage 615, control logic 620, and display logic 625.
Identification and authentication logic 605, version checking logic 610, and settings storage 615
may be configured similarly to identification and authentication logic 405/505, version checking
logic 410/5 10, and settings storage 415/515 described above with respect to laryngoscope blade
 102 and data cable 104. For example, identification and authentication logic 605 may include
logic for determining an identity of a connected laryngoscope blade 102. In some
implementations, identification and authentication logic 605 may be further configured to
determine whether the blade 102 is suitable for use with video monitor 106.
[0055]       Version checking logic 610 includes logic for determining which of data cable 104,
video monitor 106, and/or laryngoscope blade 102 has the most up-to-date set of camera settings
corresponding to the identified laryngoscope blade 102. As described above in relation to version
checking logic 410, version checking logic 610 is similarly configured to alternatively transmit
an indication of the version of the set of camera settings stored in settings storage 615 to each of
data cable 106 and/or laryngoscope blade 102 and similarly receiving corresponding information
from each of video monitor 106 and laryngoscope blade 102 before resuming the "master" role
on bus 310 (e.g., the I2C bus). When it is determined that the version of the set of camera settings
stored in settings storage 615 is the most up-to-date, version checking logic 610 may provide the
settings to image capture logic 430 in laryngoscope blade 102.
                                                - 14 -

[0056]      After version checking logic 610 completes its check, display logic 625 receives the
image data or video signal from laryngoscope blade 102 via data cable 104. As described above,
in some implementations, portions of the processing of the image data may be performed by
image processing logic 520 in data cable 204.
[0057]      Consistent with embodiments described herein, the most up-to-date camera settings
stored in one of settings storage 415, 515, or 615, may include camera settings optimized for
capturing the most useful images in an intra-airway environment. Such an environment typically
exhibits the following characteristics: 1) extremely confined field of view, typically having no
more than a 3" x 3" near circular cavity within which to operate; 2) no primary ambient
environmental lighting; all lighting relies on a fixed single point background light emitted by
light source module 116 provided immediately adjacent to camera module 114; 3) extreme red
spectrum color bias; 4) frequent extreme swings in lighting brightness caused by unpredictable
intrusion of objects into camera field of view when combined with the small usage environment;
and 5) high contrast with both near-field and far-field points of interest. Unfortunately,
conventional camera settings are not optimized for such an environment and, consequently,
images or video quality may suffer and/or pertinent visual details may be lost.
[0058]      As described above, camera module 114 comprises a CCD or CMOS device.
Consistent with embodiments described herein, camera module 114 includes a plurality of
configurable programming registers that allow the image capturing characteristics of camera
module 114 to be optimized. Settings storage 415, 515, and/or 615 in one or more of
laryngoscope blade 102, data cable 104, and video monitor 106 may be programmed to include
one or more sets of customized camera module register values to optimize image and/or video
quality in intra-airway environments. For example, different sets of customized camera module
                                                - 15 -

register values may be stored for different identified laryngoscope blades, such as blades for
adults, versus pediatric blades, etc.
[0059]       Modem camera modules generally include automatic gain control (AGC) and/or
automatic exposure control (AEC), which are designed to improve image quality by
automatically boosting the gain and increasing the exposure in low light images so that objects
can be seen more clearly and reduce the gain and decrease the exposure in bright images to avoid
the subject of the image from being washed out or blurry. Unfortunately, in intra-airway
environments, occluding elements, such as the patient's tongue, an endotracheal tube (ETT), etc.
may briefly block the camera view causing the AGC/AEC to reduce the gain and decrease the
exposure time, thereby losing far field details, which may be necessary for accurate insertion of
the laryngoscope or placement of a corresponding ETT.
[0060]       Consistent with embodiments described herein, camera module registers or settings
relating to the control of AGC and AEC may be optimized. In particular, a setting relating to an
upper limit of an AGC/AEC stable operating region may be modified. The upper limit of the
AGC/AEC stable operating region refers to how high or bright an incoming image or video
signal must become before the camera's gain algorithm mutes or attenuates the signal, by a
preset amount, before sending the signal to video monitor 106. Accordingly, consistent with
described embodiments, the upper limit of the AGC/AEC stable operating region may be raised
(from its default) so that the "trigger point" of upper limit gain attenuation does not occur until
the incoming signal significantly increases. The consequence is that any intruding near-field
object, such as a patient's tongue or a medical intubation tube, would need to either block a
larger portion of the field of view or remain in the field of view much longer.
                                                 - 16 -

[0061]      Consistent with embodiments described herein, a setting relating to the lower limit of
the AGC/AEC stable operating region may also be modified. This setting controls how low or
dim an incoming signal must achieve before the camera's gain algorithm boosts the signal sent to
host. Because a primary objective for intra-airway image capture is to ensure that a patient's far
field vocal chords are visible most of the time during an intubation procedure, the value for the
lower limit of the AGC/AEC stable operating region may be increased (from its default) to
consequently maintain the "window" in which attenuation is active to a minimum.
[0062]      In some embodiments, one or more settings relate to or identify the maximum gain
boost that can be applied when the incoming signal drops below the AGC/AEC lower limit. As
described above, since the AGC/AEC lower limit is raised in accordance with the described
embodiments, the effect is that gain boost would be triggered at gain amounts higher than
traditionally applied. This may cause images to overexpose even at moderate lighting levels,
since the lower limit was now near or above normal lighting levels. To counter this, the
automatic gain ceiling maximum AGC value setting may be lowered (from its default) to limit
the maximum boost that camera module 114 can apply. This helps manage the over exposure
effect and bring it to an acceptable level.Consistent with embodiments described herein, images
captured using the above-described optimized settings results in far end vocal cord viewing that
is, for example, approximately 25 to 166% brighter than traditional laryngoscope systems.
Further, images captured using the above-described optimized settings result in near end
reflectance of, for example, approximately 29% over traditional laryngoscope systems. For the
overall field of view, images captured using the above-described optimized settings result in a
brightness increases of between 50 and 279% over traditional laryngoscope systems for adults
and approximately 6.4% for neonatal patients. Additionally, when imaging the vocal cords, the
                                                - 17 -

color temperature of the images captured using the optimized settings shifts to the more
white/blue light and less red as compared to traditional laryngoscope systems. However, when
imaging the overall field, the color temperature shifts to the more red light and less white/blue as
compared to traditional laryngoscope systems. Consequently, images captured using the above
described optimized settings yield more a significantly more consistent color temperature.
[0063]      Fig. 7 is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary process 700 for capturing images
via video laryngoscope system 100 described herein. In one embodiment, process 700 may begin
when laryngoscope blade 102 is plugged into data cable 104, data cable 104 is plugged into
video monitor 106, and video monitor 106 is powered up (block 702).
[0064]      At block 704, data cable 104 and/or video monitor 106 identify laryngoscope blade
102 and determines whether it is authentic. For example, as described above, identification and
authentication logic 605 requests and receives blade identification information from
laryngoscope blade 102 and determines whether blade 102 is authentic and, potentially, that it
has not exceeded its authorized number of uses. If not (block 704 - NO), the process ends and a
notification or alert is output via video monitor 106 (block 705).
[0065]      However, if blade 102 is identified and determined to be authentic (block 704
YES), two or more of the laryngoscope blade 102, data cable 104, and video monitor 106
negotiate to determine which device has the most up-to-date camera settings relative to the
identified laryngoscope blade 102 (block 706). For example, as described above, each
component may alternatively assume a "master" role on bus 310 to receive version information
from the other components, which are then compared to its current version.
[0066]      At block 708, it is determined whether a device other than laryngoscope blade 102
has the most up-to-date settings. If not (block 708 - NO), the process proceeds to block 712.
                                                 - 18 -

However, when one of the other devices includes the most up-to-date settings, (block 708
YES), the settings are forwarded to camera module 114 in laryngoscope blade 102 for use during
image capture (block 710).
[0067]       At block 712, laryngoscope blade 102 receives an image capture command from
video monitor 106. For example, image capture logic 430 in laryngoscope blade 102 may receive
a request from control logic 620 in video monitor 106. In other embodiments, image capturing
may initiated automatically upon connection of laryngoscope blade 102 to video monitor 106, or
via a control on laryngoscope blade 102. In any event, once initiated, image capture logic 430
may capture images based on the settings received or verified in step 708/7 10 above (block 714).
[0068]       Captured images are forwarded to video monitor 106 via data cable 104 (block 716).
For example, image output logic 435 in laryngoscope blade 102 may output the image data
captured by camera module 114 to data cable 104. As described above, in some
implementations, some or all image processing on the image data may be performed by image
processing logic 520 in data cable 104.
[0069]       Processed image or video data is received by video monitor 106 (block 718) and
output via display 122 (block 720).
