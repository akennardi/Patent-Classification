 Field Of The Invention
         This invention relates to surgical methods and apparatus in general, and
 more particularly to surgical methods and apparatus for manipulating the side
 wall of a body lumen and/or body cavity so as to provide increased visualization
 of the same and/or increased access to the same, and/or for stabilizing instruments
 relative to the same.
 Background Of The Invention
         The human body comprises many different body lumens and body
 cavities. By way of example but not limitation, the human body comprises body

WO 2016/193820                                                            PCT/IB2016/000869
                                              6
 lumens such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels,
 the urinary tract, fallopian tubes, bronchi, bile ducts, etc. By way of further
 example but not limitation, the human body comprises body cavities such as the
 head, chest, abdomen, nasal sinuses, bladder, cavities within organs, etc.
          In many cases it may be desirable to endoscopically examine and/or treat a
 disease process or abnormality which is located within, or on the side wall of, a
 body lumen and/or body cavity. By way of example but not limitation, it may be
 desirable to examine the side wall of the gastrointestinal tract for lesions and, if a
 lesion is found, to biopsy, remove and/or otherwise treat the lesion.
          The endoscopic examination and/or treatment of the side wall of a body
 lumen and/or body cavity can be complicated by the anatomic configuration (both
 regional and local) of the side wall of the body lumen and/or body cavity, and/or
 by the consistency of the tissue making up the side wall of the body lumen and/or
 body cavity, and/or by the tethering of the side wall of the body lumen and/or
 body cavity to other anatomical structures.
          By way of example but not limitation, the intestine is an elongated tubular
 organ having an inner lumen and is characterized by frequent turns (i.e., the
 regional anatomic configuration of the intestine), and comprises a side wall
 characterized by numerous folds (i.e., the local anatomic configuration of the
 intestine), with the side wall tissue having a relatively soft, pliable consistency,
 and with the colon in particular being tethered to the abdomen and/or other
 abdominal structures via soft tissue. It can be difficult to fully visualize the side
 wall of the intestine, and/or to treat a lesion formed on the side wall of the
 intestine, due to this varying side wall anatomic configuration (both regional and
 local), its relatively soft, pliable consistency, and its tethering to other anatomical
 structures via soft tissue. By way of example but not limitation, in the case of
 colonoscopies, it has been found that approximately 5-40% of patients have an
 anatomic configuration (regional and/or local) of the side wall, and/or a tissue

WO 2016/193820                                                         PCT/IB2016/000869
                                             7
 consistency, and/or colon tethering to other anatomical structures, which makes it
 difficult to fully visualize the anatomy (including pathologic conditions of that
 anatomy, such as polyps or tumors) using conventional endoscopes, and/or to
 fully access the anatomy using instruments introduced through conventional
 endoscopes.
          In addition to the foregoing, it has also been found that some body lumens
 and/or body cavities can spasm and/or contract. This spasming and/or contraction
 can occur spontaneously, but it is particularly common when an endoscope or
 other instrument is inserted into the body lumen and/or body cavity. This
 spasming and/or contraction can cause the body lumen and/or body cavity to
 constrict and/or otherwise move and/or change its configuration, which can
 further complicate and/or compromise endoscopic visualization of the anatomy,
 and/or further complicate and/or compromise access to the anatomy using
 instruments introduced through conventional, flexible endoscopes. In addition,
 during examination of the colon, which is typically conducted while both
 advancing and withdrawing the endoscope through the colon, the endoscope may
 grip and/or otherwise gather the colon during advancement and/or withdrawal and
 then suddenly slip and release the colon. This gripping and then sudden release of
 the colon can result in the endoscope moving quickly past significant lengths of
 the colon, thereby making accurate examination of the colon challenging.
          It would, therefore, be highly advantageous to provide novel apparatus
 capable of manipulating the side wall of a body lumen and/or body cavity so as to
 better present the side wall tissue (including visualization of areas which may be
 initially hidden from view or outside the field of view) for examination and/or
 treatment during an endoscopic procedure.
          It would also be highly advantageous to provide novel apparatus capable
 of steadying and/or stabilizing the distal tips and/or working ends of instruments
 (e.g., endoscopes, articulating and/or non-articulating devices such as graspers,

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869
                                            8
 cutters or dissectors, cauterizing tools, ultrasound probes, etc.) inserted into a
 body lumen and/or body cavity with respect to the side wall of the body lumen
 and/or body cavity, whereby to facilitate the precision use of those instruments.
          Among other things, it would be highly advantageous to provide novel
 apparatus capable of steadying and/or stabilizing the distal tips and/or working
 ends of endoscopes (and hence also steadying and/or stabilizing the distal tips
 and/or working ends of other instruments inserted through the working channels
 of those endoscopes, such as graspers, cutters or dissectors, cauterizing tools,
 ultrasound probes, etc.).
          And it would be highly advantageous to provide novel apparatus capable
 of steadying and/or stabilizing the distal tips and/or working ends of instruments
 (such as graspers, cutters or dissectors, cauterizing tools, ultrasound probes, etc.)
 advanced to the surgical site by means other than through the working channels of
 endoscopes.
          It would also be highly advantageous to be able to straighten bends, "iron
 out" inner luminal surface folds and create a substantially static or stable side wall
 of the body lumen and/or body cavity, whereby to enable more precise visual
 examination (including visualization of areas which may be initially hidden from
 view or outside the field of view) and/or therapeutic intervention.
 Summary Of The Invention
          The present invention comprises the provision and use of novel apparatus

 body lumen and/or body cavity, whereby to facilitate the precision use of those
 instruments.
          Among other things, the present invention comprises the provision and use
 of novel apparatus capable of steadying and/or stabilizing the distal tips and/or
 working ends of endoscopes (and hence also steadying and/or stabilizing the
 distal tips and/or working ends of other instruments inserted through the working
 channels of those endoscopes, such as graspers, cutters or dissectors, cauterizing

 Detailed Description Of The Preferred Embodiments
         The present invention comprises the provision and use of novel apparatus
 for manipulating the side wall of a body lumen and/or body cavity so as to better
 present the side wall tissue (including visualization of areas initially hidden or
 outside the field of view) for examination and/or treatment during an endoscopic
 procedure.
         (As used herein, the term "endoscopic procedure" is intended to mean
 substantially any minimally-invasive or limited access procedure, diagnostic
 and/or therapeutic and/or surgical, for accessing,

 endoluminally or transluminally or otherwise, the interior of a body lumen and/or
 body cavity for the purposes of viewing, biopsying and/or treating tissue,
 including removing a lesion and/or resecting tissue, etc.)
          The present invention also comprises the provision and use of novel
 apparatus capable of steadying and/or stabilizing the distal tips and/or working
 ends of instruments (e.g., endoscopes, articulating and/or non-articulating devices
 such as graspers, cutters or dissectors, cauterizing tools, ultrasound probes, etc.)
 inserted into a body lumen and/or body cavity with respect to the side wall of the
 body lumen and/or body cavity, whereby to facilitate the precision use of those
 instruments.
          Among other things, the present invention comprises the provision and use
 of novel apparatus capable of steadying and/or stabilizing the distal tips and/or
 working ends of endoscopes (and hence also steadying and/or stabilizing the
 distal tips and/or working ends of other instruments inserted through the working
 channels of those endoscopes, such as graspers, cutters or dissectors, cauterizing
 tools, ultrasound probes, etc.).
          And the present invention comprises the provision and use of novel
 apparatus capable of steadying and/or stabilizing the distal tips and/or working
 ends of instruments (such as graspers, cutters or dissectors, cauterizing tools,
 ultrasound probes, etc.) advanced to the surgical site by means other than through
 the working channels of endoscopes.
          And the present invention comprises the provision and use of novel
 apparatus capable of straightening bends, "ironing out" folds and creating a
 substantially static or stable side wall of the body lumen and/or body cavity which
 enables more precise visual examination (including visualization of areas which
 may be initially hidden from view or outside the field of view) and/or therapeutic
 intervention.

                                            16
                                  The Novel Apparatus
          In accordance with the present invention, and looking now at Fig. 1, there
 is shown novel apparatus 5 which is capable of manipulating (e.g., stabilizing,
 straightening, expanding and/or flattening, etc.) the side wall of a body lumen
 and/or body cavity so as to better present the side wall tissue (including
 visualization of areas which may be initially hidden from view or outside the field
 of view) for examination and/or treatment during an endoscopic procedure using
 an endoscope 10 (e.g., an articulating endoscope), and/or for stabilizing the distal
 end of endoscope 10 and/or the distal tips and/or working ends of other
 instruments (e.g., graspers, cutters or dissectors, cauterizing tools, ultrasound
 probes, etc., not shown in Fig. 1).
          More particularly, apparatus 5 generally comprises a sleeve 15 adapted to
 be slid over the exterior of the shaft of endoscope 10, a proximal (or "aft")
 balloon 20 (the terms "proximal" and "aft" will hereinafter be used
 interchangeably) secured to sleeve 15 near the distal end of the sleeve, and a base
 25 secured to sleeve 15 at the proximal end of the sleeve. Apparatus 5 also
 comprises a pair of hollow push tubes 30 slidably mounted to sleeve 15 as will
 hereinafter be discussed, the pair of hollow push tubes being connected to one
 another at their distal ends with a raised push tube bridge 31, the raised push tube
 bridge 31 being configured to nest an endoscope therein, and a distal (or "fore")
 balloon 35 (the terms "distal" and "fore" will hereinafter be used interchangeably)
 secured to the distal ends of hollow push tubes 30, such that the spacing between
 aft balloon 20 and fore balloon 35 can be adjusted by the physician (or other
 operator or user) by moving hollow push tubes 30 relative to sleeve 15 (e.g., by
 advancing the two hollow push tubes simultaneously at push tube handle 37, see
 below). See Figs. 1 and 2-4. Apparatus 5 also comprises an associated inflation
 mechanism 40 (Fig. 1) for enabling selective inflation/deflation of one or both of
 aft balloon 20 and fore balloon 35 by the physician (or other operator or user).

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869
                                              17
                                          The Sleeve
           Looking now at Figs. 1-6, sleeve 15 generally comprises an elongated,
 thin-walled tube configured to be slid over the exterior of the shaft of endoscope
  10 (e.g., retrograde from the distal tip of the endoscope) so as to make a close fit
 therewith, with the sleeve being sized and constructed so that it will slide easily
 back over the endoscope during mounting thereon (preferably with the scope
 "dry") but will have sufficient residual friction (when gripped by the hand of the
 physician or other operator or user) with the outer surface of the endoscope such
 that the sleeve will remain in place to allow torqueing (i.e., rotational turning) and
 pushing/pulling of the endoscope during use (e.g., within the colon of a patient).
 In one preferred form of the invention, sleeve 15 can move circumferentially to
 some extent about endoscope 10 (and when gripped securely by the hand of the
 physician or other operator or user, can rotate in conjunction with the shaft of the
 endoscope); but sleeve 15 can only move nominally in an axial direction relative
 to endoscope 10. Sleeve 15 is sized so that when its distal end is substantially
 aligned with the distal end of endoscope 10, sleeve 15 (in conjunction with base
 25) will substantially cover the shaft of the endoscope. In any case, sleeve 15 is
 sized so that when it is mounted to endoscope 10 and endoscope 10 is inserted
 into a patient, sleeve 15 extends out of the body of the patient. In one preferred
 form of the invention, apparatus 5 is provided according to the particular
 endoscope with which it is intended to be used, with apparatus 5 being sized so
 that when base 25 is in engagement with the handle of the endoscope, the distal
 end of sleeve 15 will be appropriately positioned at the distal end of the
 endoscope, i.e., substantially aligned with the distal end of the endoscope or
 slightly proximal to the distal end of the endoscope.
           If desired, the distal end of sleeve 15 may be provided with a radially
 inwardly-extending stop (not shown) to positively engage the distal end surface of

WO 2016/193820                                                           PCT/IB2016/000869
                                            18
 endoscope 10, whereby to prevent the distal end of sleeve 15 from moving
 proximally beyond the distal end surface of endoscope 10. Such a radially
 inwardly-extending stop can also assist in preventing "torque slip" of sleeve 15
 relative to endoscope 10 during torqueing (i.e., rotational turning) of the
 endoscope while within the colon, and/or "thrust slip" of sleeve 15 relative to
 endoscope 10 during forward pushing of the endoscope while within the colon.
          Sleeve 15 preferably has a smooth outer surface so as to be non-traumatic
 to tissue, and is preferably made of a highly flexible material such that the sleeve
 will not inhibit bending of the endoscope during use. In one preferred form of the
 invention, sleeve 15 comprises polyurethane, polyethylene, poly(vinyl chloride)
 (PVC), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), etc., and is preferably transparent (or at
 least translucent) so as to allow distance markings on endoscope 10 to be
 visualized through sleeve 15. And in one preferred form of the invention, sleeve
  15 preferably has nominal hoop strength, so that the physician (or other operator
 or user) can grip endoscope 10 through sleeve 15, e.g., so as to torque the scope.
 If desired, sleeve 15 can include a lubricious coating (e.g., a liquid such as
 perfluoropolyether synthetic oil, a powder, etc.) on some or all of its interior
 and/or exterior surfaces, so as to facilitate disposition of the sleeve over the
 endoscope and/or movement of apparatus 5 through a body lumen and/or body
 cavity. Alternatively, sleeve 15 may be formed of a material which is itself
 lubricious, e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), etc. It should be appreciated that
 the inside surface of sleeve 15 may include features (e.g., ribs) to prevent the
 sleeve from rotating relative to the endoscope during use.
          If desired, a vacuum may be "pulled" between sleeve 15 and endoscope
  10, whereby to secure sleeve 15 to endoscope 10 and minimize the profile of
 sleeve 15. By way of example but not limitation, a vacuum may be introduced at
 the proximal end of sleeve 15 (i.e., at base 25) or a vacuum may be introduced at
 a point intermediate sleeve 15. By way of further example but not limitation, it

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           19
 should also be appreciated that removal of sleeve 15 from endoscope 10 (e.g., at
 the conclusion of a procedure) may be facilitated by introducing a fluid (e.g., air
 or a liquid lubricant) into the space between sleeve 15 and endoscope 10, e.g., at
 the proximal end of sleeve 15 (i.e., at base 25) or intermediate sleeve 15.
                                     The Aft Balloon
         Still looking now at Figs. 1-6, aft balloon 20 is secured to sleeve 15 just
 proximal to the articulating joint of the endoscope near to, but spaced from, the
 distal end of the sleeve. Aft balloon 20 is disposed concentrically about sleeve
  15, and hence concentrically about an endoscope 10 disposed within sleeve 15.
 Thus, aft balloon 20 has a generally toroidal shape. Aft balloon 20 may be
 selectively inflated/deflated by means of a proximal inflation/deflation tube 45
 which has its distal end in fluid communication with the interior of aft balloon 20,
 and which has its proximal end in fluid communication with a fitting 46 mounted
 to base 25. Fitting 46 is configured for connection to the aforementioned
 associated inflation mechanism 40. Fitting 46 is preferably a luer-activated valve,
 allowing inflation mechanism 40 to be disconnected from fitting 46 without
 losing pressure in aft balloon 20. Inflation/deflation tube 45 may be secured to
 the exterior surface of sleeve 15 or, more preferably, inflation/deflation tube 45
 may be contained within a lumen 47 formed within sleeve 15.
         Preferably aft balloon 20 is disposed a short distance back from the distal
 end of sleeve 15, i.e., by a distance which is approximately the same as the length
 of the articulating portion of a steerable endoscope 10, such that the articulating
 portion of the steerable endoscope will be disposed distal to aft balloon 20 when
 the steerable endoscope is disposed in sleeve 15. This construction allows the
 flexible portion of the steerable endoscope to be articulated even when aft balloon
 20 has been inflated in the anatomy so as to stabilize the adjacent non-articulating
 portion of the endoscope relative to the anatomy, as will hereinafter be discussed

WO 2016/193820                                                        PCT/IB2016/000869
                                          20
 in further detail. Thus, when inflated, aft balloon 20 provides a secure platform
 within the anatomy for maintaining endoscope 10 in a stable position within a
 body lumen or body cavity, with endoscope 10 centered within the body lumen or
 body cavity. As a result, endoscope 10 can provide improved visualization of the
 anatomy. Furthermore, inasmuch as endoscope 10 is securely maintained within
 the body lumen or body cavity by the inflated aft balloon 20, instruments
 advanced through the internal lumens (sometimes referred to as the "working
 channel" or "working channels") of endoscope 10 will also be provided with a
 secure platform for supporting those instruments within the body lumen or body
 cavity.
         When aft balloon 20 is appropriately inflated, the aft balloon can
 atraumatically engage and form a sealing relationship with the side wall of a body
 lumen within which apparatus 5 is disposed.
         In one preferred form of the invention, aft balloon 20 is formed out of
 polyurethane.
                                       The Base
         Base 25 is secured to the proximal end of sleeve 15. Base 25 engages
 endoscope 10 and helps secure the entire assembly (i.e., apparatus 5) to
 endoscope 10. Base 25 preferably comprises a substantially rigid or semi-rigid
 structure which may be gripped by the physician (or other operator or user) and
 pulled proximally, whereby to allow the physician (or other operator or user) to
 pull sleeve 15 over the distal end of endoscope 10 and then proximally back along
 the length of endoscope 10, whereby to mount sleeve 15 to the outer surface of
 the shaft of the endoscope. In one preferred form of the invention, base 25 is
 pulled proximally along the endoscope until base 25 seats against the handle of
 the endoscope, thereby prohibiting further proximal movement of base 25 (and
 hence thereby prohibiting further proximal movement of sleeve 15). In one

WO 2016/193820                                                         PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           21
 preferred form of the invention, base 25 makes a sealing engagement with
 endoscope 10.
             The Pair Of Hollow Push Tubes And The Push Tube Handle
         The pair of hollow push tubes 30 are slidably mounted to sleeve 15,
 whereby the distal ends of the hollow push tubes (and the raised push tube bridge
 31 connecting the distal ends of the pair of hollow push tubes 30) can be extended
 and/or retracted relative to sleeve 15 (e.g., by advancing or withdrawing the
 hollow push tubes via push tube handle 37, see below), and hence extended
 and/or retracted relative to the distal end of endoscope 10 which is disposed in
 sleeve 15. Preferably, hollow push tubes 30 are slidably disposed in support tubes
 50 which are secured to the outer surface of sleeve 15 or, more preferably, are
 contained within lumens 52 formed within sleeve 15. Support tubes 50 are
 preferably formed out of a low friction material (e.g., polytetrafluoroethylene,
 also known as "PTFE") so as to minimize resistance to movement of hollow push
 tubes 30 relative to support tubes 50 (and hence minimize resistance to movement
 of hollow push tubes 30 relative to sleeve 15). In this respect it should be
 appreciated that minimizing resistance to the movement of hollow push tubes 30
 relative to support tubes 50 improves tactile feedback to the user when hollow
 push tubes 30 are being used to manipulate fore balloon 35. In one form of the
 invention, support tubes 50 are flexible (so as to permit endoscope 10, and
 particularly the articulating portion of steerable endoscope 10, to flex as needed
 during the procedure); however, support tubes 50 also provide some column
 strength. Thus, when support tubes 50 are mounted within lumens 52 formed in
 sleeve 15, the assembly of sleeve 15 and hollow support tubes 50 is flexible yet
 has a degree of column strength (whereas sleeve 15 alone is flexible but has
 substantially no column strength). In the event that hollow push tubes 30 are
 contained within lumens 52 formed in sleeve 15, and in the event that support

WO 2016/193820                                                         PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           22
 tubes 50 are not disposed between hollow push tubes 30 and lumens 52, lumens
 52 are preferably lubricated so as to minimize friction between hollow push tubes
 30 and lumens 52.
         The distal ends of the pair of hollow push tubes 30 are connected together
 with a raised push tube bridge 31 (Fig. 7). Raised push tube bridge 31 provides a
 rounded structure at the distal ends of hollow push tubes 30 which simultaneously
 serves to (i) connect the distal ends of hollow push tubes 30 together, and (ii)
 eliminate abrupt ends at the distal end of hollow push tubes 30 which could cause
 trauma to tissue, e.g., during distal advancement of hollow push tubes 30. Raised
 push tube bridge 31 is configured to nest an endoscope therein (Fig. 8).
         In one preferred form of the invention, raised push tube bridge 31 is also
 hollow. In this form of the invention, the hollow raised push tube bridge 31 may
 be formed integral with hollow push tubes 30, i.e., the hollow push tubes 30 and
 the hollow raised push tube bridge 31 may form one continuous tube (Figs. 9-11).
 Or, in this form of the invention, the hollow raised push tube bridge 31 may be
 formed separately from hollow push tubes 30 and the hollow raised push tube
 bridge 31 may be joined to hollow push tubes 30 during manufacturing (Fig. 12).
         In one preferred form of the invention, raised push tube bridge 31 may be
 substantially solid and is connected with hollow push tubes 30 during
 manufacture.
         If desired, raised push tube bridge 31 may be inclined distally, e.g., in the
 manner shown in Figs. 7-12.
         Alternatively, if desired, raised push tube bridge 31 may be set
 substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axes of hollow push tubes 30, e.g.,
 in the manner shown in Fig. 13.
         Furthermore, if desired, raised push tube bridge 31 may be in the form of a
 ring, with endoscope 10 nesting within the interior of the ring, e.g., in the manner
 shown in Fig. 14.

WO 2016/193820                                                         PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           23
          The proximal ends of hollow push tubes 30 are connected to push tube
 handle 37. As a result of this construction, pushing distally on push tube handle
 37 causes the distal ends of hollow push tubes 30 to move distally (at the same
 rate) relative to sleeve 15 (whereby to move fore balloon 35 distally relative to aft
 balloon 20) and pulling proximally on push tube handle 37 causes the distal ends
 of hollow push tubes 30 to retract proximally (at the same rate) relative to sleeve
  15 (whereby to move fore balloon 35 proximally relative to aft balloon 20). Note
 that by moving hollow push tubes 30 distally or proximally at the same rate, the
 distal ends of the hollow push tubes are maintained parallel to each other. A
 clamp 53 (Figs. 37 and 60) is provided at base 25 for holding hollow push tubes
 30 in a selected disposition relative to base 25 (and hence in a selected disposition
 relative to sleeve 15).
          Hollow push tubes 30 and raised push tube bridge 31 are preferably
 formed out of a relatively flexible material which provides good column strength,
 e.g., a thermoplastic polyethylene resin such as IsoplastTM (available from The
 Lubrizol Corporation of Wickliffe, Ohio), polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon,
 etc. It should be appreciated that hollow push tubes 30 and raised push tube
 bridge 31 can comprise a single material or a plurality of materials, and that the
 stiffness of hollow push tubes 30 and raised push tube bridge 31 can vary along
 their length. By way of example but not limitation, the distal-most portion of
 hollow push tubes 30 and raised push tube bridge 31 can be formed of the same
 material as the remainder of the hollow push tubes but have a lower modulus so
 as to be more flexible than the remainder of the hollow push tubes, or the distal
 most portion of hollow push tubes 30 and raised push tube bridge 31 can comprise
 a different, more resilient flexible material. By way of example but not limitation,
 the distal-most portion of hollow push tubes 30 and raised push tube bridge 31
 can comprise Nitinol. By way of further example but not limitation, the distal
 most portion of hollow push tubes 30 and raised push tube bridge 31 can comprise

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869

 a stainless steel coil covered with an outer jacket of polytetrafluoroethylene
 (PTFE), with the distal-most jacket/more-proximal tubing together providing a
 sealed lumen for inflating/deflating fore balloon 35. By forming hollow push
 tubes 30 and raised push tube bridge 31 with distal ends which are more flexible
 than the remainder of the hollow push tubes, the hollow push tubes 30, raised
 push tube bridge 31 and fore balloon 35 can together function as a lead (with a
 soft atraumatic tip) for apparatus 5 and endoscope 10, as discussed further below.
          In one preferred form of the invention, hollow push tubes 30 are
 configured to maintain a parallel disposition when they are in an unbiased state,
 i.e., when no force is being applied to hollow push tubes 30. This is true
 regardless of the state of inflation or deflation of fore balloon 35. The provision
 of raised push tube bridge 31 can help maintain the parallel disposition of hollow
 push tubes 30.
          The distal-most portion of hollow push tubes 30 can be configured to bend
 inwardly or outwardly if desired e.g., via their connection to raised push tube
 bridge 31. With such a configuration, when the distal ends of hollow push tubes
 30 are held longitudinally stationary (e.g., by an inflated fore balloon, as will
 hereinafter be discussed) and a sufficient distally-directed force is applied to
 hollow push tubes 30, the middle portions of hollow push tubes 30 (i.e., the
 portions between the inflated fore balloon 35 and sleeve 15) can bend or bow
 outwardly, whereby to push outwardly on the side wall of the body lumen which
 apparatus 5 is disposed in, thereby providing a "tenting" effect on the side wall of
 the body lumen and/or body cavity in the space between aft balloon 20 and fore
 balloon 35. This "tenting" effect can significantly enhance visibility and/or tissue
 stability in the area distal to endoscope 10, by pushing outwardly on the side wall
 of the body lumen and/or body cavity in which apparatus 5 is disposed.
          It should also be appreciated that by forming hollow push tubes 30 out of a
 flexible material, it is possible to manually adjust their position during use (e.g.,

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869
                                            25
 by using a separate tool, by torqueing the apparatus, etc.) so as to prevent the
 hollow push tubes 30 from interfering with visualization of the patient's anatomy
 and/or interfering with diagnostic or therapeutic tools introduced into the space
 between the fore and aft balloons 35, 20. By way of example but not limitation, if
 apparatus 5 is disposed in the anatomy in such a way that a hollow push tube 30
 blocks visual or physical access to a target region of the anatomy, the flexible
 hollow push tube(s) may be moved out of the way by using a separate tool or
 instrument, or by rotating the apparatus with a torqueing motion so as to move the
 flexible hollow push tube(s) out of the way, etc. By way of further example but
 not limitation, by constructing hollow push tubes 30 so that they are circular and
 flexible and of a diameter significantly smaller than the round circumference of
 endoscope 10, the movement of the round endoscope, when articulated, can
 simply push the hollow push tubes out of the way and provides a unobstructed
 visual path to the tissue of interest.
          It should also be appreciated that, if desired, hollow push tubes 30 can be
 marked with an indicator including distance markers (not shown in the figures),
 e.g., colored indicators or radiopaque indicators, so that a physician (or other
 operator or user) observing the surgical site via endoscope 10 or by radiological
 guidance (e.g., X-ray fluoroscopy) can ascertain the relative disposition of hollow
 push tubes 30 at the surgical site both longitudinally and/or circumferentially with
 respect to the side wall of the body lumen and/or other body cavity.
          Hollow push tubes 30 have their internal lumens (i) in fluid
 communication with the interior of fore balloon 35 (Figs. 1-5, 15 and 16), e.g., via
 a plurality of openings 32, and (ii) in fluid communication with a fitting 56
 mounted to base 25. Fitting 56 is configured for connection to the
 aforementioned associated inflation mechanism 40, in order that fore balloon 35
 may be selectively inflated/deflated with air or other fluids (including liquids).

WO 2016/193820                                                           PCT/IB2016/000869
                                            26
 Fitting 56 is preferably a luer-activated valve, allowing inflation mechanism 40 to
 be disconnected from fitting 56 without losing pressure in fore balloon 35.
          More particularly, in one preferred form of the present invention, and
 looking now at Fig. 17, push tube handle 37 comprises a hollow interior 57.
 Hollow push tubes 30 are mounted to push tube handle 37 so that hollow push
 tubes 30 will move in conjunction with push tube handle 37, and so that the
 hollow interiors of hollow push tubes 30 are in fluid communication with the
 hollow interior 57 of push tube handle 37. Push tube handle 37 also comprises a
 fitting 58 which is in fluid communication with hollow interior 57 of push tube
 handle 37. A flexible tube 59 connects fitting 58 with an internal chamber (not
 shown) in base 25, with this internal chamber in base 25 being in fluid
 communication with the aforementioned fitting 56. As a result of this
 construction, when push tube handle 37 is moved distally, hollow push tubes 30
 are moved distally, and hence fore balloon 35 is moved distally; and when push
 tube handle 37 is moved proximally, hollow push tubes 30 are moved proximally,
 and hence fore balloon 35 is moved proximally. Furthermore, when positive fluid
 pressure is applied to fitting 56 in base 25, positive fluid pressure is applied to the
 internal lumens of hollow push tubes 30, and hence to the interior of fore balloon
 35 (i.e., via openings 32), whereby to inflate fore balloon 35; and when negative
 fluid pressure is applied to fitting 56 in base 25, negative fluid pressure is applied
 to the internal lumen of hollow push tubes 30, and hence to the interior of fore
 balloon 35 (i.e., via openings 32), whereby to deflate fore balloon 35.
          It should be appreciated that the provision of a pair of hollow push tubes
 30, connected together at their distal ends by a raised push tube bridge 31,
 provides numerous advantages. By way of example but not limitation, the
 provision of a pair of hollow push tubes 30, connected together at their distal ends
 by a raised push tube bridge 31, provides a symmetric force to fore balloon 35
 when the fore balloon is advanced distally into a body lumen, as will hereinafter

WO 2016/193820                                                         PCT/IB2016/000869
                                          27
 be discussed. Furthermore, the provision of a pair of hollow push tubes 30,
 connected together at their distal ends by a raised push tube bridge 31, provides
 equal outward forces against the adjacent anatomy when the pair of hollow push
 tubes are employed to straighten out the anatomy in the area proximate the distal
 end of endoscope 10, thereby enhancing visualization of, and/or access to, the
 anatomy, as will hereinafter be discussed. In addition, the provision of a pair of
 hollow push tubes 30, connected together at their distal ends by a raised push tube
 bridge 31, ensures that fore balloon 35 remains centered on endoscope 10, thereby
 facilitating un-docking of fore balloon 35 from endoscope 10 and re-docking of
 fore balloon 35 over endoscope 10, as will hereinafter be discussed. In addition,
 the provision of a pair of hollow push tubes 30, connected together at their distal
 ends by a raised push tube bridge 31, helps ensure that fore balloon 35 is stable
 relative to the tip of the endoscope, minimizing rotational movement of the fore
 balloon when inflated. Furthermore, the provision of a pair of hollow push tubes,
 connected together at their distal ends by a raised push tube bridge 31, provides a
 redundant air transfer system for inflating or deflating fore balloon 35. And the
 provision of a pair of hollow push tubes 30, connected together a their distal ends
 by a raised push tube bridge 31, presents a rounded, blunt distal end for hollow
 push tubes 30, thereby ensuring atraumatic advancement of fore balloon 35 within
 the anatomy.
                                    The Fore Balloon
          Fore balloon 35 is secured to the distal ends of hollow push tubes 30, with
 raised push tube bridge 31 being disposed within the interior of fore balloon 35,
 whereby the spacing between aft balloon 20 and fore balloon 35 can be adjusted
 by moving hollow push tubes 30 relative to sleeve 15, i.e., by moving push tube
 handle 37 relative to sleeve 15. Furthermore, hollow push tubes 30 provide a

WO 2016/193820                                                             PCT/IB2016/000869
                                             28
 conduit between the interior of fore balloon 35 and fitting 56, whereby to permit
 selective inflation/deflation of fore balloon 35 via fitting 56.
          Significantly, fore balloon 35 is configured so that (i) when it is deflated
 (or partially deflated) and it is in its "retracted" position relative to sleeve 15 (Fig.
 2), fore balloon 35 provides an axial opening 63 (Figs. 15, 16 and 19) sufficient to
 accommodate sleeve 15 and the shaft of endoscope 10 therein, with raised push
 tube bridge 31 extending concentrically about axial opening 63, whereby fore
 balloon 35 can be "docked" over sleeve 15 and endoscope 10, and (ii) when fore
 balloon 35 is in its "extended" position relative to sleeve 15 and is appropriately
 inflated (Fig. 4), axial opening 63 is closed down (and preferably completely
 closed off). At the same time, when appropriately inflated, the fore balloon can
 atraumatically engage and form a sealing relationship with the side wall of a body
 lumen and/or body cavity within which apparatus 5 is disposed. Thus, when fore
 balloon 35 is appropriately inflated, the fore balloon can effectively seal the body
 lumen and/or body cavity distal to fore balloon 35, by closing down axial opening
 63 and forming a sealing relationship with the side wall of the body lumen and/or
 body cavity within which apparatus 5 is disposed. In this way, when hollow push
 tubes 30 are advanced distally so as to separate fore balloon 35 from aft balloon
 20, and when fore balloon 35 and aft balloon 20 are appropriately inflated, the
 two balloons will create a sealed zone therebetween (sometimes hereinafter
 referred to as "the therapeutic zone").
          It will be appreciated that, when fore balloon 35 is reconfigured from its
 deflated condition to its inflated condition, fore balloon 35 expands radially
 inwardly (so as to close down axial opening 63) as well as radially outwardly (so
 as to engage the surrounding tissue). Note that hollow push tubes 30 and raised
 push tube bridge 31 are disposed within fore balloon 35 in such a way that their
 presence within the fore balloon does not physically interfere with inflation or
 deflation of fore balloon 35.

WO 2016/193820                                                         PCT/IB2016/000869
                                            29
          Thus it will be seen that fore balloon 35 has a "torus" shape when deflated
 (to allow it to seat over the distal end of the endoscope) and a substantially "solid"
 shape when inflated (to allow it to close off a body lumen or body cavity).
          To this end, and looking now at Figs. 18 and 19, fore balloon 35 is
 preferably manufactured as a single construct comprising a body 67 having a
 proximal opening 69 and a distal opening 71, a proximal extension 73 having a
 "key-shaped" cross-section comprising lobes 74, and a distal extension 76 having
 a circular cross-section. Note that lobes 74 are disposed on proximal extension 73
 with a configuration which matches the configuration of hollow push tubes 30
 (i.e., where apparatus 5 comprises two hollow push tubes 30 diametrically
 opposed to one another, proximal extension 73 will comprise two lobes 74
 diametrically opposed to one another - for the purposes of the present invention,
 proximal extension 73 and lobe(s) 74 may be collectively referred to as having a
 "key-shaped" cross-section). During assembly, proximal extension 73 is everted
 into the interior of body 67, hollow push tubes 30 are seated in lobes 74 of
 proximal extension 73, (with the interiors of hollow push tubes 30 being in fluid
 communication with the interior of body 67 and with raised push tube bridge 31
 disposed within the interior of body 67), and then distal extension 76 is everted
 into the interior of proximal extension 73, whereby to provide a fore balloon 35
 having axial opening 63 extending therethrough, with hollow push tubes 30 being
 secured to fore balloon 35 and communicating with the interior of fore balloon 35,
 and with raised push tube bridge 31 being disposed concentrically about axial
 opening 63. Significantly, axial opening 63 is sized to receive the distal end of
 endoscope 10 therein, and raised push tube bridge 31 is sized to nest endoscope
  10 in the area beneath the raised push tube bridge 31. Also significantly, the
 formation of fore balloon 35 by the aforementioned process of everting proximal
 extension 73 into the interior of body 67, and then everting distal extension 76
 into the interior of proximal extension 73, provides multiple layers of balloon

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869
                                             30
 material around hollow push tubes 30, thereby providing a more robust balloon
 construction. Among other things, providing multiple layers of balloon material
 around hollow push tubes 30 adds cushioning to the distal ends of hollow push
 tubes 30, thereby providing an even more atraumatic distal tip to hollow push
 tubes 30 and further ensuring that the distal tips of hollow push tubes 30 do not
 damage the adjacent tissue.
          In one preferred form of the invention, fore balloon 35 is formed out of
 polyurethane.
          It should be appreciated that when fore balloon 35 is in its deflated
 condition, the material of fore balloon 35 substantially encompasses the distal
 ends of hollow push tubes 30 and raised push tube bridge 31 (while still allowing
 hollow push tubes 30 to be in fluid communication with the interior of fore
 balloon 35, i.e., via openings 32), thereby providing an atraumatic tip for
 advancing fore balloon 35 distally through a body lumen. Furthermore, hollow
 push tubes 30, raised push tube bridge 31 and the deflated fore balloon 35 can,
 together, essentially function as a soft-tipped lead for apparatus 5 and endoscope
  10, as discussed further below (Fig. 93).
          If desired, one or both of aft balloon 20 and fore balloon 35 can be marked
 with an indicator (e.g., a color indicator or a radiopaque indicator) so that a
 physician (or other operator or user) observing the surgical site via endoscope 10
 or radiological guidance (e.g., X-ray fluoroscopy) can ascertain the disposition of
 one or both of the balloons at the surgical site.
          Alternative Construction For The Base And The Push Tube Handle
          As noted above, and as shown in Fig. 1, apparatus 5 comprises a base 25
 which is secured to sleeve 15 at the proximal end of the sleeve and which carries
 fittings 46, 56 for inflating/deflating aft balloon 20 and/or fore balloon 35,
 respectively. Apparatus 5 also comprises a push tube handle 37 which has hollow

WO 2016/193820                                                         PCT/IB2016/000869
                                            31
 push tubes 30 mounted thereto, with hollow push tubes 30 physically supporting
 (and providing fluid communication to) the interior of fore balloon 35. As also
 noted above, proximal inflation/deflation tube 45 provides fluid communication
 between fitting 46 of base 25 and the interior of aft balloon 20; and a flexible tube
 59 provides (with other elements) fluid communication between fitting 56 of base
 25 and the interior of hollow push tubes 30 (and hence the interior of fore balloon
 35).
          With the construction shown in Fig. 1, base 25 supports and guides hollow
 push tubes 30 as they are advanced distally or retracted proximally, but base 25
 does not directly support and guide push tube handle 37 as it is advanced distally
 or retracted proximally.
          To that end, if desired, and looking now at Figs. 20-25, apparatus 5 may
 comprise a similar but somewhat different base (i.e., the base 25A) and a similar
 but somewhat different push tube handle (i.e., the push tube handle 37A). Base
 25A comprises an extension 205 which has the aforementioned fittings 46, 56
 mounted thereto. Extension 205 comprises a center slot 210 and a pair of side
 slots 215. Push tube handle 37A comprises a C-shaped body 220 having hollow
 push tubes 30 mounted thereto, and having a center locking element 225 and a
 pair of finger grips 230 mounted thereto. Locking element 225 preferably
 comprises a screw shaft 235 and a screw knob 240, such that screw knob 240 can
 be advanced towards or away from body 220 by turning the screw knob.
          Push tube handle 37A is mounted within extension 205 of base 25A so
 that screw shaft 235 is slidably received in center slot 210 and so that finger grips
 230 are slidably received in side slots 215, whereby to provide support and
 guidance to push tube handle 37A.
          As a result of this construction, push tube handle 37A can be moved
 distally or proximally by moving screw shaft 235 and finger grips 230 distally or
 proximally, whereby to move fore balloon 35 distally or proximally; and push

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           32
 tube handle 37A can be locked in position relative to body 25A by turning screw
 knob 240 so that it securely engages the outer surface of extension 205, whereby
 to lock fore balloon 35 in position relative to body 25A. Note that torsion can be
 applied to fore balloon 35 by applying torsion to finger grips 230, e.g., by moving
 one side wing 230 distally while pulling the other side wing 230 proximally.
         Figs. 26-30 show different configurations for screw knob 240.
         If desired, lubricious washers 245 may be added to the assembly to reduce
 friction (Fig. 31), or texture may be added to surfaces (e.g., the underside of screw
 knob 240 as shown in Fig. 32) so as to increase friction. Furthermore, finger grips
 230 may be shaped differently than those illustrated in Figs. 20-30, or moved to a
 different portion of the assembly. See, for example, Fig. 33, which shows finger
 grips 230 formed as part of a second knob 250 which keys to the slider assembly.
         It should also be appreciated that, if desired, push tube handle 37A may
 comprise a generally C-shaped body having a different configuration from the C
 shaped body 220 shown in Figs. 23, 25, 31 and 33. By way of example but not
 limitation, and looking now at Fig. 34, C-shaped body 220 may comprise a pair of
 downwardly extending legs 255 connected by a linkage 260.
                                The Inflation Mechanism
         Inflation mechanism 40 provides a means to selectively inflate aft balloon
 20 and/or fore balloon 35.
         In one preferred form of the present invention, and looking now at Figs. 1
 and 35, inflation mechanism 40 comprises a single-line syringe inserter 140
 comprising a body 145 and a plunger 150. Preferably a spring 153 is provided in
 body 145 to automatically return plunger 150 at the end of its stroke. Syringe
 inserter 140 is connected to one or the other of fittings 46, 56 via a line 155.
 Thus, with this construction, when single-line syringe inserter 140 is to be used to
 inflate aft balloon 20, syringe inserter 140 is connected to fitting 46 via line 155

WO 2016/193820                                                            PCT/IB2016/000869
                                             33
 so that the output of single-line syringe inserter 140 is directed to aft balloon 20
 (i.e., via proximal inflation/deflation tube 45). Correspondingly, when single-line
 syringe inserter 140 is to be used to inflate fore balloon 35, syringe inserter 140 is
 connected to fitting 56 via line 155 so that the output of single-line syringe
 inserter 140 is directed to fore balloon 35 (i.e., via flexible tube 59 and the
 interiors of hollow push tubes 30 and out of openings 32).
           In another preferred form of the present invention, and looking now at Fig.
 36, inflation mechanism 40 comprises an elastic bulb 156 having a first port 157
 and a second port 158. A one-way valve 159 (e.g., a check valve) is disposed in
 first port 157 so that air can only pass through first port 157 when traveling in an
 outward direction. Another one-way valve 159 (e.g., a check valve) is disposed in
 second port 158 so that air can only pass through second port 158 when traveling
 in an inward direction. When elastic bulb 156 is compressed (e.g., by hand), air
 within the interior of elastic bulb 156 is forced out first port 157; and when elastic
 bulb 156 is thereafter released, air is drawn back into the interior of elastic bulb
  156 through second port 158.
           As a result of this construction, when elastic bulb 156 is to be used to
 inflate aft balloon 20, first port 157 is connected to fitting 46 via line 155 so that
 the positive pressure output of elastic bulb 156 is directed to aft balloon 20.
 Elastic bulb 156 may thereafter be used to deflate aft balloon 20, i.e., by
 connecting second port 158 to fitting 46 via line 155 so that the suction of elastic
 bulb 156 is directed to aft balloon 20. Correspondingly, when elastic bulb 156 is
 to be used to inflate fore balloon 35, first port 157 is connected to fitting 56 via
 line 155 so that the positive pressure output of elastic bulb 156 is directed to fore
 balloon 35. Elastic bulb 156 may thereafter be used to deflate fore balloon 35,
 i.e., by connecting second port 158 to fitting 56 via line 155 so that the suction of
 elastic bulb 156 is directed to fore balloon 35.

                                           34
          Alternatively, and looking now at Figs. 37 and 38, a syringe 160 may be
 used to inflate aft balloon 20 and/or fore balloon 35. Inflation mechanism 160
 comprises a body 161 and a plunger 162. Preferably a spring (not shown) is
 provided in body 161 to automatically return plunger 162 at the end of its power
 stroke. Syringe 160 is connected to fittings 46, 56 via a line 163. With this
 construction, syringe 160 comprises a valve 165 for connecting syringe 160 to
 fore balloon 35 or aft balloon 20, and a valve 170 for selecting inflation or
 deflation of the connected-to balloon.
          Thus, with this construction, when syringe 160 is to be used to inflate aft
 balloon 20, valve 165 (a two-position valve that connects valve 170 to either the
 fore balloon or the aft balloon) is set so that the syringe 160 is connected through
 fitting 46 to aft balloon 20, and valve 170 (a 2-way crossover valve which allows
 the one-way valves to be arranged to inflate in one configuration and deflate in
 the other configuration) is set so that syringe 160 is providing inflation pressure.
 Thereafter, when aft balloon 20 is to be deflated, valve 170 is set to its deflate
 position.
          Correspondingly, when syringe 160 is to be used to inflate fore balloon 35,
 valve 165 is set so that syringe 160 is connected through fitting 56 to fore balloon
 35, and valve 170 is set so that syringe 160 is providing inflation pressure.
 Thereafter, when fore balloon 35 is to be deflated, valve 170 is set to its deflate
 position.
          In another preferred form of the present invention, and looking now at
 Figs. 39-58, inflation mechanism 40 comprises a hand inflator 300 also formed in
 accordance with the present invention. Hand inflator 300 generally comprises a
 housing 305 carrying a bulb or "pump" 310, an aft balloon inflation line 315 (for
 connection to fitting 46 of apparatus 5, see Fig. 1), a fore balloon inflation line
 320 (for connection to fitting 56 of apparatus 5, see Fig. 1), and internal
 pneumatic apparatus 325 (Fig. 42) for directing air between pump 310 and aft

WO 2016/193820                                                         PCT/IB2016/000869

 balloon inflation line 315 and fore balloon inflation line 320 (and for venting air
 from aft balloon inflation line 315 and fore balloon inflation line 320), all as will
 hereinafter be discussed.
          As seen in Figs. 42 and 43, internal pneumatic apparatus 325 comprises a
 check valve 330, a check valve 335, a check valve 340, a multi-way valve 345, a
 fore balloon indicator 350, an aft balloon indicator 355, a check valve 360, a
 check valve 365, an "air in" port 367 and an "air out" port 368. A selector knob
 370 (Figs. 39, 40 and 41) is attached to multi-way valve 345 so as to allow the
 user to set multi-way valve 345 as desired, and openings 375, 380 (Fig. 40) are
 formed in housing 305 so as to expose fore balloon indicator 350 and aft balloon
 indicator 355, respectively, to the view of the user.
          Looking now at Figs. 44 through 47, internal pneumatic apparatus 325 is
 configured so that (i) aft balloon 20 can be selectively inflated by pump 310, (ii)
 aft balloon 20 can be selectively deflated by pump 310, (iii) fore balloon 35 can
 be selectively inflated by pump 310, and (iv) fore balloon 35 can be selectively
 deflated by pump 310.
          More particularly, when aft balloon 20 is to be inflated, and looking now
 at Fig. 44, selector knob 370 is set so that multi-way valve 345 creates a fluid line
 connecting "air in" port 367, check valve 340, check valve 335, pump 310, check
 valve 330, aft balloon indicator 355, check valve 365, aft balloon inflation line
 315 and aft balloon 20, so that repeated compressions of pump 310 inflates aft
 balloon 20, with the pressure within aft balloon 20 being indicated by aft balloon
 indicator 355.
          When aft balloon 20 is to be deflated, and looking now at Fig. 45, selector
 knob 370 is set so that multi-way valve 345 creates a fluid line connecting aft
 balloon 20, aft balloon inflation line 315, check valve 365, aft balloon indicator
 355, check valve 340, check valve 335, pump 310, check valve 330 and "air out"

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869

 port 368, so that repeated compressions of pump 310 deflates aft balloon 20, with
 the pressure within aft balloon 20 being indicated by aft balloon indicator 355.
         When fore balloon 35 is to be inflated, and looking now at Fig. 46,
 selector knob 370 is set so that multi-way valve 345 creates a fluid line
 connecting "air in" port 367, check valve 340, check valve 335, pump 310, check
 valve 330, fore balloon indicator 350, check valve 360, fore balloon inflation line
 320 and fore balloon 35, so that repeated compressions of pump 310 inflates fore
 balloon 35, with the pressure within fore balloon 35 being indicated by fore
 balloon indicator 350.
         When fore balloon 35 is to be deflated, and looking now at Fig. 47,
 selector knob 370 is set so that multi-way valve 345 creates a fluid line
 connecting fore balloon 35, fore balloon inflation line 320, check valve 360, fore
 balloon indicator 350, check valve 340, check valve 335, pump 310, check valve
 330 and "air out" port 368, so that repeated compressions of pump 310 deflates
 fore balloon 35, with the pressure within fore balloon 35 being indicated by fore
 balloon indicator 350.
         In one preferred form of the invention, and looking now at Figs. 48 and
  13K, fore balloon indicator 350 and aft balloon indicator 355 each comprise a
 piston 385. Piston 385 is created by attaching two end caps 390, 395 together
 with a pliable extrusion 400. End cap 390 is securely mounted to housing 305
 and is pneumatically connected by a tube 405 to the system pressure which is to
 be measured (i.e., to a balloon, either the fore balloon 35 or the aft balloon 20,
 depending on whether piston 385 is employed in fore balloon indicator 350 or aft
 balloon indicator 355). End cap 395 rides along tube 405 and abuts a spring 410
 which engages a wall 415 of housing 305. End cap 395 includes an alignment
 feature 420 which is slidably disposed in a guide (not shown) in housing 305, and
 a color pressure indicator 425 which is visible through one or the other of the
 aforementioned openings 375, 380 (depending on whether piston 385 is employed

WO 2016/193820                                                           PCT/IB2016/000869
                                            37
 in fore balloon indicator 350 or aft balloon indicator 355). End cap 395 acts as
 the pressure indicator, inasmuch as the longitudinal position of second end cap
 395 along tube 405 (relative to wall 415) is an indicator of system pressure. In
 essence, the two end caps 390, 395 and extrusion 400 effectively constitute a
 piston (i.e., piston 385) which expands and contracts as the system pressure
 changes, with system pressure being reflected by the disposition of color pressure
 indicator 425 relative to one or the other of the aforementioned openings 375,
 380.
           When there is no pressure in the system (i.e., when the fore balloon or the
 aft balloon is entirely deflated), the indicator remains in the position shown in Fig.
 50. In this position, extrusion 400 is collapsed and folded upon itself. When
 pressure is introduced into the system (and hence, into tube 405) and a balloon
 (i.e., fore balloon 35 or aft balloon 20) begins to inflate, end cap 395 begins to
 move relative to tube 405, compressing spring 410. The distance that end cap 395
 moves depends on the pressure in the system (i.e., the pressure within tube 405),
 the diameter of the extrusion, and the bias force of the spring. Fig. 51 shows
 piston 385 and extrusion 400 fully extended (i.e., indicating maximum pressure
 within the system or, to put it another way, complete inflation of either fore
 balloon 35 or aft balloon 20). Ideally, the fully-extended position of color
 pressure indicator 425 relative to openings 375, 380 in housing 305 correlates to
 the maximum allowable pressure of fore balloon 35 or aft balloon 20.
           It should be appreciated that since the position of a color pressure
 indicator 425 relative to an opening 375, 380 in housing 305 is reflective of the
 pressure within the system (i.e., the pressure within either fore balloon 35 or aft
 balloon 20), in one preferred form of the present invention, various colors (e.g.,
 green, yellow and red) are used to correspond to various predetermined pressures
 within the system.

WO 2016/193820                                                           PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           38
          Thus, the design shown in Figs. 48-53 comprises a colored indicator (i.e.,
 color pressure indicator 425) attached to the "dynamic" (i.e., moving) end cap 395
 of piston 385. The color scheme on each indicator alerts the user as to how "full"
 (i.e., how inflated) each of the balloons (i.e., fore balloon 35 or aft balloon 20) is.
 However, it should also be appreciated that, if desired, the indicator could
 comprise numeric pressure values instead of colors. Alternatively, the pressure
 level could be indicated by a strip of colors (or numbers) fixed to the housing (i.e.,
 adjacent openings 375, 380 in housing 305). In this form of the invention, the end
 cap 395 comprises a pointer which extends out of opening 375 or 380 and, as the
 piston expands (i.e., as pliable extrusion 400 expands and end cap 395 moves
 toward wall 415 against the power of spring 410) and contracts (i.e., as pliable
 extrusion 400 contracts and end cap 395 moves away from wall 415 under the
 power of spring 410), the pointer points to the appropriate pressure indication
 mark on housing 305.
          The design shown in Figs. 48-53 illustrates the two end caps 390, 395 of
 piston 385 being separated by a tubular pliable extrusion 400. However, it should
 also be appreciated that, if desired, pliable extrusion 400 may be replaced by a
 balloon 430 (Fig. 54). Balloon 430 is preferably spherical (Fig. 54), although it
 may also comprise other shapes if desired (see, for example, Fig. 55, which shows
 a generally diamond-shaped balloon 430, and Fig. 56 which shows a generally
 tubular balloon 430). Or, if desired, balloon 430 may be used to push a flag
 upward, i.e., perpendicular to the axis of the balloon, instead of expanding a
 piston along its axis. See Figs. 57 and 58.
          In yet another form of the invention, inflation mechanism 40 may
 comprise an automated source of fluid pressure (either positive or negative), e.g.,
 an electric pump.
          If desired, and looking now at Fig. 59, a relief valve 175 can be connected
 to the inflation/deflation line which connects to fore balloon 35 so as to ensure

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869
                                            39
 that the pressure within fore balloon 35 does not exceed a predetermined level.
 Similarly, and still looking now at Fig. 59, a relief valve 180 can be connected to
 the inflation/deflation line which connects to aft balloon 20 so as to ensure that
 the pressure within aft balloon 20 does not exceed a predetermined level.
          Alternatively, and/or additionally, one or more pressure gauges 182 (Fig. 1
 or Fig. 38) may be incorporated into the fluid line connected to aft balloon 20,
 and/or the fluid line connected to fore balloon 35, whereby to provide the
 physician (or other operator or user) with information relating to the pressure
 inside aft balloon 20 and/or fore balloon 35 so as to avoid over inflation and/or to
 help the physician (or other operator or user) ascertain the inflation state of a
 balloon during a procedure.
          Furthermore, it will be appreciated that as fore balloon 35 moves between
 its "retracted" position (Fig. 2) and its "extended" position (Fig. 4), the flexible
 tube 59 connecting push tubes 30 to base 25 (and hence to fitting 56) may gather
 about base 25, potentially interfering with the physician's (or other operator's or
 user's) actions. Accordingly, if desired, and looking now at Fig. 60, a flexible
 tube retraction system 185 may be provided (e.g., within base 25) to take up slack
 in flexible tube 59 when fore balloon 35 is extended.
                     Hand Inflator Incorporating A Novel Manifold
          As discussed above, in one preferred form of the invention, inflation
 mechanism 40 comprises a hand inflator 300 (Figs. 39-58) for selectively
 inflating/deflating a selected one of fore balloon 35 and aft balloon 20. Hand
 inflator 300 generally comprises a manual pump (e.g., bulb 310) for providing an
 air pressure/suction source, and a multi-way valve 345 for directing the flow of air
 from/to bulb 310 to/from a selected one of fore balloon 35 and aft balloon 20.
          In one form of the present invention, and looking first at Figs. 61 and 62,
 multi-way valve 345 preferably takes the form of a novel manifold 500 disposed

                                           40
 within housing 305 of hand inflator 300. Manifold 500 generally comprises a
 bottom plate 505 fluidically connected to bulb 310, a rotatable middle plate 510,
 and a top plate 515 fluidically connected to fore balloon 35, aft balloon 20, fore
 balloon indicator 350 and aft balloon indicator 355. A shaft 520 passes through,
 and connects together, top plate 515, middle plate 510 and bottom plate 505, as
 will hereinafter be discussed in further detail.        Looking next at Fig. 63,
 bottom plate 505 generally comprises a body 525 having a cavity 530 formed
 therein. Bottom plate 505 also comprises an inflation port 535 configured to be
 fluidically connected to an air pressure source (e.g., bulb 310) and a deflation port
 540 configured to be fluidically connected to an air suction source (e.g., bulb
 310). Inflation port 535 and deflation port 540 are fluidically connected to cavity
 530, as will hereinafter be discussed in further detail.
         Cavity 530 of bottom plate 505 comprises (i) a central opening 545 which
 passes through body 525 of bottom plate 505 for rotatably receiving shaft 520
 therein, and (ii) a plurality of O-rings 550 which are disposed in cavity 530 and
 arranged concentrically about central opening 545. O-rings 550 define two ring
 shaped zones which are disposed coaxially relative to one another and which can
 be fluidically isolated from one another (i.e., when middle plate 510 is mounted
 on top of bottom plate 505 and covers cavity 530, as will hereinafter be
 discussed). More particularly, O-rings 550 define an inner deflation zone 555 and
 an outer inflation zone 560 disposed coaxially about inner deflation zone 555.
 Inner deflation zone 555 comprises an opening 565 which is fluidically connected
 to deflation port 540, and outer inflation zone 560 comprises an opening 570
 which is fluidically connected to inflation port 535. In one preferred form of the
 invention, bottom plate 505 also comprises a check valve 575 fluidically
 connected to deflation port 540 for allowing bulb 310 to "re-form" (i.e., draw air
 through check valve 575) when it is not possible to draw air from atmosphere

 through inner deflation zone 555 (it will be appreciated that check valve 575 is
 functionally equivalent to the check valve 340 shown in Fig. 65).
         Looking next at Fig. 64, middle plate 510 comprises a body 580 having a
 smooth bottom surface 585 for sealingly engaging O-rings 550 disposed in cavity
 530 of bottom plate 505 (whereby to fluidically seal inner deflation zone 555 and
 outer inflation zone 560), and a smooth top surface 590 for sealingly engaging top
 plate 515, as will hereinafter be discussed in further detail. Body 580 of middle
 plate 510 comprises a central opening 595 which passes through body 580 of
 middle plate 510 and is configured to engage shaft 520 (e.g., central opening 595
 may comprise a non-circular cross-section which mates with a portion of shaft
 520 having a corresponding non-circular cross-section) such that rotation of shaft
 520 causes corresponding rotation of middle plate 510. Middle plate 510 also
 comprises an inner hole 600 and an outer hole 605 which are disposed on a
 common radius and which pass through body 580 of middle plate 510. Inner hole
 600 is disposed so as to be in common orbit with, and fluidically connected to,
 inner deflation zone 555 of bottom plate 505 when middle plate 510 is mounted
 over bottom plate 505. Outer hole 605 is disposed so as to be in common orbit
 with, and fluidically connected to, outer inflation zone 560 of bottom plate 505
 when middle plate 510 is mounted over bottom plate 505.
         Looking next at Figs. 65-67, top plate 515 comprises a body 610 having a
 bottom surface 615, a top surface 620 and a central opening 625 passing through
 body 610 for rotatably receiving shaft 520. Top plate 515 also comprises an aft
 balloon connection port 630 for fluidically connecting aft balloon 20 to manifold
 500, an aft balloon indicator port 635 for fluidically connecting aft balloon
 indicator 355 to manifold 500, an aft balloon channel 640 extending between aft
 balloon connection port 630 and aft balloon indicator port 635, a fore balloon
 connection port 645 for fluidically connecting fore balloon 35 to manifold 500, a
 fore balloon indicator port 650 for fluidically connecting fore balloon indicator

          Bottom surface 615 of body 610 comprises an aft balloon inflation port
 660 and an aft balloon deflation port 665 which open on bottom surface 615 and
 which are fluidically connected to aft balloon channel 640. Bottom surface 615 of
 body 610 also comprises a fore balloon inflation port 670 and a fore balloon
 deflation port 675 which open on bottom surface 615 and which are fluidically
 connected to fore balloon channel 655. A plurality of O-rings 680 are disposed
 about ports 660, 665, 670, 675 for effecting sealing engagement of ports 660, 665,
 670, 675 with top surface 590 of middle plate 510 as will hereinafter be discussed
 in further detail. In one preferred form of the present invention, bottom surface
 615 of body 610 also comprises a balance O-ring 685 for helping to maintain
 sealing engagement of O-rings 680 with top surface 590 of middle plate 510, as
 will hereinafter be discussed in further detail.
          In one preferred form of the invention, top plate 515 also comprises an aft
 balloon channel check valve 690 disposed in top plate 515 (it will be appreciated
 that check valve 690 is functionally equivalent to the check valve 365 shown in
 Fig. 65). Aft balloon check valve 690 is in fluid communication with aft balloon
 channel 640 and prevents over-inflation of aft balloon 20 by releasing air to
 atmosphere when the air pressure within aft balloon channel 640 (which is the
 same as the air pressure within aft balloon 20) exceeds a predetermined threshold.
 In one preferred form of the invention, top plate 515 also comprises a fore balloon
 channel check valve 695 disposed in top plate 515 (it will be appreciated that
 check valve 695 is functionally equivalent to the check valve 360 shown in Fig.
 43). Fore balloon check channel valve 695 is in fluid communication with fore
 balloon channel 655 and prevents over-inflation of fore balloon 35 by releasing
 air to atmosphere when the air pressure within fore balloon channel 655 (which is

 the same as the air pressure within fore balloon 35) exceeds a predetermined
 threshold.
                           Assembly of The Novel Manifold
         Looking next at Figs. 68 and 69, manifold 500 is assembled such that
 middle plate 510 is rotatably disposed between bottom plate 505 and top plate
 515, with shaft 520 passing through central opening 625 of top plate 515, through
 central opening 595 of middle plate 510 and through central opening 545 of
 bottom plate 505. More particularly, the distal end of shaft 520 comprises a distal
 bearing 700 which is secured to shaft 520 by a retainer clip 705. The proximal
 end of shaft 520 comprises a proximal bearing 710 which is secured to the
 proximal end of shaft 520, with a spring 715 being disposed between proximal
 bearing 710 and top surface 620 of top plate 515. A selector knob 720 is fixedly
 mounted to the proximal end of shaft 520 such that rotation of selector knob 720
 causes corresponding rotation of shaft 520 (and hence corresponding rotation of
 middle plate 510). Shaft 520 is able to rotate freely within central opening 625 of
 top plate 515 and central opening 545 of bottom plate 505, and to also rotate
 freely within proximal bearing 710 and distal bearing 700. However, shaft 520
 engages central opening 595 of middle plate 510 such that rotation of shaft 520
 causes corresponding rotation of middle plate 510, whereby to permit a user to
 selectively rotate middle plate 510 (i.e., by rotating selector knob 720, which, in
 turn, rotates middle plate 510).
         It will be appreciated that when the various components are assembled on
 shaft 520, bottom plate 505, middle plate 510 and top plate 515 are "sandwiched"
 between distal bearing 700 and proximal bearing 710 under compression provided
 by spring 715, whereby to maintain constant contact (i) between bottom surface
 585 of middle plate 510 and O-rings 550 of bottom plate 505, (ii) between top
 surface 590 of middle plate 510 and O-rings 680 of top plate 515 (i.e., between

          As a result, an air-tight air pathway is maintained through manifold 500
 between a selected one of (i) inflation port 535 or deflation port 540, and (ii) a
 selected one of fore balloon 35 or aft balloon 20, such that bulb 310 may be used
 to selectively inflate or deflate a selected one of fore balloon 35 or aft balloon 20,
 as will hereinafter be discussed in further detail.
          More particularly, it will be appreciated that rotating selector knob 720
 causes shaft 520 to rotate, thereby causing middle plate 510 to rotate. When this
 occurs, inner hole 600 and outer hole 605 of middle plate 510 also rotate relative
 to bottom plate 505 and top plate 515. Since inner hole 600 of middle plate 510 is
 aligned in common orbit with inner deflation zone 555 of bottom plate 505, inner
 hole 600 is always aligned with inner deflation zone 555, regardless of the
 rotational position of middle plate 510 (and hence, inner hole 600 is always
 fluidically connected to deflation port 540, i.e., vis-a-vis opening 565 in inner
 deflation zone 555). Similarly, since outer hole 605 of middle plate 510 is aligned
 in common orbit with outer inflation zone 560 of bottom plate 505, outer hole 605
 is always aligned with outer inflation zone 560 (and hence, outer hole 605 is
 always fluidically connected to inflation port 535 vis-a-vis opening 570 in outer
 inflation zone 560).
          It will also be appreciated that when middle plate 510 is rotated (i.e., by
 rotating selector knob 720), inner hole 600 of middle plate 510 may be positioned
 so that it is (i) aligned with aft balloon deflation port 665, or (ii) aligned with fore
 balloon deflation port 675, or (iii) unaligned with a port 665, 675 (and hence open
 to atmosphere). Similarly, outer hole 605 of middle plate 510 may be positioned
 so that it is (i) aligned with aft balloon inflation port 660, or (ii) aligned with fore

WO 2016/193820                                                           PCT/IB2016/000869
                                            45
 balloon inflation port 670, or (iii) unaligned with a port 660, 670 (and hence open
 to atmosphere). In this respect it will be appreciated that the provision of O-rings
 680 and balance O-ring 685 creates a small gap between bottom surface 615 of
 top plate 515 and top surface 590 of middle plate 510, such that when either (or
 both) of inner hole 600 and/or outer hole 605 of middle plate 510 are unaligned
 with a port 665, 675, 660, 670, inner hole 600 and/or outer hole 605 are connected
 with atmosphere.
          As a result of this construction, it will be appreciated that middle plate 510
 can be selectively rotated so as to occupy one of five states: (1) an aft balloon
 inflation state, wherein outer hole 605 of middle plate 510 is aligned with aft
 balloon inflation port 660 of top plate 515 and inner hole 600 of middle plate 510
 is open to atmosphere ("State 1"); (2) an aft balloon deflation state wherein outer
 hole 605 of middle plate 510 is open to atmosphere and inner hole 600 of middle
 plate 510 is aligned with aft balloon deflation port 665 of top plate 515 ("State
 2"); (3) a fore balloon inflation state wherein outer hole 605 of middle plate 510 is
 aligned with fore balloon inflation port 670 of top plate 515 and inner hole 600 of
 middle plate 510 is open to atmosphere ("State 3"); (4) a fore balloon deflation
 state wherein outer hole 605 of middle plate 510 is open to atmosphere and inner
 hole 600 of middle plate 510 is aligned with fore balloon deflation port 675
 ("State 4"); or (5) an inactive state wherein neither outer hole 605 nor inner hole
 600 of middle plate 510 is aligned with a port 660, 665, 670, 675 in top plate 515,
 i.e., wherein both outer hole 605 and inner hole 600 are open to atmosphere and
 with ports 660, 665, 670, 675 of top plate 515 being fluidically sealed against top
 surface 590 of middle plate 510 ("State 5").
          Thus it will be seen that the relative positions of aft balloon inflation port
 660, aft balloon deflation port 665, fore balloon inflation port 670 and fore
 balloon deflation port 675 within bottom surface 615 of top plate 515 can be

WO 2016/193820                                                         PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           46
 arranged such that rotation of middle plate 510 causes selective switching
 between the States 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 discussed above.
          By way of example but not limitation, in one preferred form of the present
 invention, State 1 is effected when knob 720 is in the "8 o'clock" position, State 2
 is effected when knob 720 is in the "4 o'clock" position, State 3 is effected when
 knob 720 is in the "10 o'clock" position, and State 4 is effected when knob 720 is
 in the "2 o'clock" position. In this form of the invention, State 5 is effected
 whenever knob 720 is rotated to a position intermediate the aforementioned
 positions.
          1. Aft Balloon Inflation. Looking now at Figs. 70-72, there is shown the
 path that air travels through manifold 500 when middle plate 510 is in State 1
 discussed above for effecting aft balloon inflation (i.e., when middle plate 510 is
 rotated such that outer hole 605 of middle plate 510 is aligned with aft balloon
 inflation port 660 of top plate 515 and inner hole 600 of middle plate 510 is open
 to atmosphere). In State 1, when bulb 310 is squeezed and released, free air from
 atmosphere is drawn into inner hole 600 of middle plate 510, passes into inner
 deflation zone 555 of bottom plate 505, through opening 565 in inner deflation
 zone 565, through deflation port 540, into bulb 310 and then back out of bulb 310,
 into inflation port 535, through opening 570, into outer inflation zone 560,
 through outer hole 605 of middle plate 510, into aft balloon inflation port 660,
 through aft balloon channel 640, out of aft balloon connection port 630 and into
 aft balloon 20. It should be appreciated that as this occurs, and looking now at
 Fig. 72, aft balloon deflation port 665, fore balloon inflation port 670 and fore
 balloon deflation port 675 are all fluidically sealed against top surface 590 of
 middle plate 510 so that air cannot enter or leave via ports 665, 670, 675, and
 hence, when manifold 500 is in State 1, inflation of aft balloon 20 does not have
 any effect on fore balloon 35.

                                           47
          2. Aft Balloon Deflation. Looking next at Figs. 73 and 74, there is shown
 the path that air travels through manifold 500 when middle plate 510 is in State 2
 discussed above for effecting aft balloon deflation (i.e., when middle plate 510 is
 rotated such that outer hole 605 of middle plate 510 is open to atmosphere and
 inner hole 600 of middle plate 510 is aligned with aft balloon deflation port 665).
 In State 2, when bulb 310 is squeezed and released, air from aft balloon 20 is
 drawn into aft balloon connection port 630, through aft balloon channel 640, out
 aft balloon deflation port 665, through inner hole 600 of middle plate 510, into
 inner deflation zone 555, through opening 565, out deflation port 540, into bulb
 310, back out of bulb 310, into inflation port 535, through opening 570 in outer
 inflation zone 560, into outer inflation zone 560, through outer hole 605 of middle
 plate 510 and out to atmosphere. It should be appreciated that as this occurs, aft
 balloon inflation port 660, fore balloon inflation port 670 and fore balloon
 deflation port 675 are all fluidically sealed against top surface 620 of middle plate
 510 so that air cannot enter or leave via ports 660, 670, 675, and hence, when
 manifold 500 is in State 2, deflation of aft balloon 20 does not have any effect on
 fore balloon 35.
          3. Fore Balloon Inflation. Looking next at Figs. 75 and 76, there is shown
 the path that air travels through manifold 500 when middle plate 510 is in State 3
 discussed above for effecting fore balloon inflation (i.e., when middle plate 510 is
 rotated such that outer hole 605 of middle plate 510 is aligned with fore balloon
 inflation port 670 of top plate 515 and inner hole 600 of middle plate 510 is open
 to atmosphere). In State 3, when bulb 310 is squeezed and released, free air from
 atmosphere is drawn into inner hole 600 of middle plate 510, passes into inner
 deflation zone 555 of bottom plate 505, through opening 565 in inner deflation
 zone 565, through deflation port 540, into bulb 310 and then back out of bulb 310,
 into inflation port 535, through opening 570, into outer inflation zone 560,
 through outer hole 605 of middle plate 510, into fore balloon inflation port 670,

WO 2016/193820                                                         PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           48
 through fore balloon channel 655, out of fore balloon connection port 645 and
 into fore balloon 35. It should be appreciated that as this occurs, aft balloon
 deflation port 665, aft balloon inflation port 660 and fore balloon deflation port
 675 are all fluidically sealed against top surface 590 of middle plate 510 so that
 air cannot enter or leave via ports 665, 660, 675, and hence, when manifold 500 is
 in State 3, inflation of fore balloon 35 does not have any effect on aft balloon 20.
         4. Fore Balloon Deflation. Looking next at Figs. 77 and 78, there is
 shown the path that air travels through manifold 500 when middle plate 510 is in
 State 4 discussed above for effecting fore balloon deflation (i.e., when middle
 plate 510 is rotated such that outer hole 605 of middle plate 510 is open to
 atmosphere and inner hole 600 of middle plate 510 is aligned with fore balloon
 deflation port 675). In State 4, when bulb 310 is squeezed and released, air from
 fore balloon 35 is drawn into fore balloon connection port 645, through fore
 balloon channel 655, through fore balloon deflation port 675, through inner hole
 600 of middle plate 510, into inner deflation zone 555, through opening 565,
 through deflation port 540, into bulb 310, back out of bulb 310 into inflation port
 535, through opening 570 in outer inflation zone 560, into outer inflation zone
 560, and through outer hole 605 of middle plate 510 and into atmosphere. It
 should be appreciated that as this occurs, aft balloon inflation port 660, aft balloon
 deflation port 665 and fore balloon inflation port 670 are all fluidically sealed
 against top surface 590 of middle plate 510 so that air cannot enter or leave ports
 660, 665, 670, and hence, when manifold 500 is in State 4, deflation of fore
 balloon 35 does not have any effect on aft balloon 20.
         5. Fore Balloon And Aft Balloon Sealed Against Inflation/Deflation.
 When middle plate 510 is disposed in State 5 discussed above (i.e., when middle
 plate 510 is rotated such that inner hole 600 and outer hole 605 are both open to
 atmosphere), aft balloon inflation port 660, aft balloon deflation port 665, fore
 balloon inflation port 670 and fore balloon deflation port 675 are all sealed

WO 2016/193820                                                           PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           49
 against top surface 590 of middle plate 510. In State 5, squeezing and releasing
 of bulb 310 has no effect on either fore balloon 35 or aft balloon 20 (inasmuch as
 air is drawn into inner hole 600 of middle plate 510, enters inner deflation zone
 555, passes through opening 565, passes out deflation port 540 and into bulb 310,
 and is then passed from bulb 310, into inflation port 535, through opening 570
 and into outer inflation zone 560, and then out through outer hole 605 to
 atmosphere).
                              Alternative Novel Manifold
          It should be appreciated that other manifolds may be utilized in inflation
 mechanism 40 in place of the novel manifold 500 discussed above.
          By way of example but not limitation, and looking now at Fig. 79, there is
 shown another novel manifold 500A for selectively inflating or deflating a
 selected one of aft balloon 20 and fore balloon 35. Manifold 500A serves the
 same function as manifold 500 discussed above (i.e., manifold 500A selectively
 controls a plurality of airway paths in order to permit a user to selectively inflate
 or deflate a selected one of aft balloon 20 and fore balloon 35 using a single user
 interface), however, manifold 500A employs a somewhat different construction
 than manifold 500.
          Looking now at Fig. 80, manifold 500A generally comprises a rotatable
 control dial and a plurality of tubes (labelled 1-6 in Fig. 80), with the control dial
 being configured to selectively close-off one or more of the plurality of tubes and
 to selectively open one or more of the plurality of tubes as the rotatable control
 dial is rotated. More particularly, and still looking at Fig. 80, there is shown a
 rotatable control dial 800 comprising a body 805. Body 805 comprises a first
 groove 810 having a first cutout section 815 and a second cutout section 820, a
 second groove 825 having a first cutout section 830 and a second cutout section
 835, a third groove 840 having a cutout section 845, a fourth groove 850 having a

WO 2016/193820                                                         PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           50
 cutout section 855, a fifth groove 860 having a cutout section 865 and a sixth
 groove 870 having a cutout section 875.
          The plurality of tubes discussed above are fixed in place relative to
 rotatable control dial 800 and each of the plurality of tubes passes through one of
 first groove 810, second groove 825, third groove 840, fourth groove 850, fifth
 groove 860 and sixth groove 870. More particularly, a first tube 880 in fluid
 connection with bulb 310 and atmosphere passes through first groove 810, a
 second tube 885 in fluid connection with bulb 310 and atmosphere passes through
 second groove 825, a third tube 890 in fluid connection with aft balloon 20 and
 bulb 310 passes through third groove 840, a fourth tube 895 in fluid connection
 with aft balloon 20 and bulb 310 passes through fourth groove 850, a fifth tube
 900 in fluid connection with fore balloon 35 and bulb 310 passes through fifth
 groove 860, and a sixth tube 905 in fluid connection with fore balloon 35 and bulb
 310 passes through sixth groove 870.
          First groove 810, second groove 825, third groove 840, fourth groove 850,
 fifth groove 860 and sixth groove 870 are sized such that first tube 880, second
 tube 885, third tube 890, fourth tube 895, fifth tube 900 and sixth tube 905 are
 "pinched off' such that air cannot flow throw the tube whenever the tube is
 disposed in a section of its respective groove 810, 825, 840, 860, 870 which is not
 a cutout section. As a result, air can only flow through a given tube 880, 885,
 890, 895, 900, 905 when the tube is disposed in a cutout section formed in the
 groove that the tube is disposed in.
          More particularly, first tube 880 only permits passage of air through the
 tube when it is disposed in either cutout section 815 or cutout section 820 of first
 groove 810, second tube 885 only permits passage of air through the tube when it
 is disposed in either cutout section 830 or cutout section 835, third tube 890 only
 permits passage of air through the tube when it is disposed in cutout section 845,
 etc. Since tubes 880, 885, 890, 895, 900 and 905 are fixed in location relative to

WO 2016/193820                                                         PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           51
 control dial 800, when control dial 800 is selectively rotated by a user, cutout
 sections 815, 820, 830, 835, 845, 855, 865 and 875 move relative to tubes 880,
 885, 890, 895, 900 and 905. By controlling where the cutout sections 815, 820,
 830, 835, 845, 855, 865 and 875 are formed in body 805 of control dial 800, it is
 possible to control which of the tubes 880, 885, 890, 895, 900 and 905 will be
 "pinched off' and which will reside in a cutout section 815, 820, 830, 835, 845,
 855, 865 and 875 when control dial 800 is rotated to a given position. Thus it is
 possible to control the flow of air to and from bulb 310, and to simultaneously
 control the flow of air to and from a selected one of aft balloon 20 and fore
 balloon 35, by selectively moving control dial 800 to a specific position. Further
 details regarding the flow of air through manifold 500A are provided in Figs. 81
 and 82.
                   Venting Of Balloons Through Packaging Design
          In one preferred form of the present invention, and looking now at Fig. 83,
 novel apparatus 5 is sealed within a sterile package 1000 until novel apparatus 5 is
 to be used. Package 1000 is typically provided in the form of a bottom tray 1005
 which is sized to hold novel apparatus 5, and a cover 1010 for mating to, and
 sealing off, bottom tray 1005. Fore balloon 35 and aft balloon 20 are in their
 deflated condition when novel apparatus 5 is sealed within sterile package 1000.
          While fore balloon 35 and aft balloon 20 are stored within package 1000
 in their deflated condition, it has been found that it is sometimes possible for a
 small amount of residual air to remain within fore balloon 35 and/or aft balloon
 20 and/or the various fluid pathways leading to fore balloon 35 and/or aft balloon
 20 (e.g., hollow push tubes 30, push tube bridge 31, proximal inflation/deflation
 tube 45, etc.). As a result, when novel apparatus 5 (sealed within package 1000)
 is thereafter shipped to a recipient via a means of transportation where package
  1000 is exposed to a substantial change in air pressure (e.g., when novel apparatus

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           52
 5 is shipped to a recipient via an airplane), the change in air pressure can cause
 the residual air remaining within fore balloon 35 and/or aft balloon 20 (and/or the
 various fluid pathways leading to fore balloon 35 and/or aft balloon 20) to
 expand. Such expansion while novel apparatus 5 is sealed within package 1000
 can cause damage to fore balloon 35, aft balloon 20 and/or other components of
 novel apparatus 5.
          One possible solution to the foregoing problem is to fully evacuate all of
 the air from fore balloon 35, aft balloon 20 and all of the pathways, leading to fore
 balloon 35 and aft balloon 20 before novel apparatus 5 is sealed within package
  1000. However, it has been found that it can be challenging to evacuate all of the
 air from fore balloon 35, aft balloon 20 and the pathways leading to fore balloon
 35 and aft balloon 20. In addition, it has also been found that it can be
 challenging to ensure that no air is thereafter able to leak back into any of the
 evacuated components of novel apparatus 5.
          Another possible solution is to allow the air within the interior of package
  1000 to freely enter and exit the components of novel apparatus 5, e.g., by leaving
 one or both of fittings 46, 56 open to airflow, etc. However, with such an "open
 valve" configuration, the recipient (e.g., the surgeon) would need to be diligent in
 closing any open valves prior to using novel apparatus 5. It is possible that a
 recipient may inadvertently leave a valve open that should be closed prior to using
 novel apparatus 5, thereby causing malfunction of novel apparatus 5.
          Thus there is a need for a new and improved way to maintain a free
 exchange of air between the interior of package 1000 and fore balloon 35 and aft
 balloon 20, while automatically sealing off that free exchange of air when the user
 removes novel apparatus 5 from package 1000.
          To this end, and looking now at Fig. 84, a fore balloon venting check
 valve 1015 and an aft balloon venting check valve 1015A are provided in hand
 inflator 300, with fore balloon venting check valve 1015 being disposed in fore

WO 2016/193820                                                           PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           53
 balloon inflation line 320 and with aft balloon venting check valve 1015A being
 disposed in aft balloon inflation line 315. For clarity of illustration, only fore
 balloon venting check valve 1015 is shown in Figs. 85-88 and discussed in detail
 hereinbelow, however, it should be appreciated that aft balloon venting check
 valve 1015A is identical in construction and function to fore balloon venting
 check valve 1015 (although aft balloon venting check valve 1015A is disposed in
 aft balloon inflation line 315 rather than in fore balloon inflation line 320).
          Looking now at Figs. 85-88, fore balloon venting check valve 1015 and aft
 balloon venting check valve 1015A are disposed in the bottom surface of housing
 305 of hand inflator 300, such that they are in fluid communication with fore
 balloon inflation line 320 and aft balloon inflation line 315, respectively, and
 hence in fluid communication with fore balloon 35 and aft balloon 20,
 respectively. More particularly, fore balloon venting check valve 1015 comprises
 a lumen 1020 having a first end in fluid communication with fore balloon
 inflation line 320 and a second end having an opening 1025 formed in the outer
 surface of housing 305. A ball (e.g., a rubber ball) 1030 is movably disposed
 within lumen 1020 and is biased against opening 1025 by a spring 1035. When
 ball 1030 is biased against opening 1025, air cannot pass through opening 1025
 and into (or out of) fore balloon inflation line 320, i.e., fore balloon 35 is sealed
 off against the free passage of air into (or out of) fore balloon 35.
          Bottom tray 505 comprises an upwardly-extending finger 1040 which is

 housing 305 when novel apparatus 5 (and, more specifically, hand inflator 300) is
 disposed within bottom tray 1005 of package 1000. Finger 1040 is sized such that
 when it is received within opening 1025, a finger 1040 engages ball 1030 and
 drives ball 1030 against the power of spring 1035, whereby to unseat ball 1030
 from opening 1025. At the same time, a gap remains between finger 1040 and the
 sides of opening 1025, whereby to allow air to pass from the interior of package

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869

  1000 through fore balloon venting check valve 1015, through fore balloon
 inflation line 320 and into fore balloon 35, and vice versa (Fig. 87).
         Bottom tray 1005 comprises a similar finger 1040A for forcing check
 valve 1015A open when hand inflator 300 is seated in bottom tray 1005 of
 package 1000.
         If desired, an upwardly-extending stop (not shown) may also be provided
 on bottom tray 1005 of package 1000 for engaging the bottom surface of housing
 305 of hand inflator 300 when hand inflator 300 is disposed within bottom tray
  1005 of package 1000, whereby to ensure that an air gap is maintained between
 the bottom surface of hand inflator 300 and the bottom surface of bottom tray
  1005, and hence ensure that air is free to flow through check valves 1015, 1015A
 when hand inflator 300 is seated in bottom tray 1005 of package 1000.
         As a result of this construction, when novel apparatus 5 is disposed in
 bottom tray 1005, fingers 1040, 1040A open fore balloon venting check valve
  1015 and aft balloon venting check valve 1015A, respectively, so that air is
 permitted to freely enter into, and exit out of, fore balloon 35 and aft balloon 20
 via fore balloon venting check valve 1015 and aft balloon venting check valve
  1015A, respectively. This eliminates the aforementioned problems associated
 with exposing package 1000 to substantial changes in air pressure (e.g., during
 shipping) and prevents damage to apparatus 5 during shipping.
         When apparatus 5 is to be used, cover 1010 is removed from package
  1000 and novel apparatus 5 is removed from bottom tray 1005. When this occurs,
 fingers 1040, 1040A are withdrawn from fore balloon venting check valve 1015
 and aft balloon venting check valve 1015A, respectively, thereby allowing these
 check valves to return to their "closed" positions.
         Thus it will be seen that fore balloon venting check valve 1015 and aft
 balloon venting check valve 1015A act to protect novel apparatus 5 from

 exposure to air pressure differentials during shipping/storage and does so in a
 passive fashion that does not require the recipient to close any valves.
                   Preferred Method Of Using The Novel Apparatus
          Apparatus 5 may be used to manipulate, (e.g., stabilize, straighten, expand
 and/or flatten, etc.) the side wall of a body lumen and/or body cavity so as to
 better present the side wall tissue (including visualization of areas which may be
 initially hidden from view or outside the field of view) for examination and/or
 treatment during an endoscopic procedure using endoscope 10, and/or to stabilize
 the distal tips and/or working ends of instruments (e.g., graspers, cutters or
 dissectors, cauterizing tools, ultrasound probes, etc.), e.g., advanced into the
 therapeutic zone.
          More particularly, in use, sleeve 15 is first mounted to endoscope 10 (Fig.
  1). This may be accomplished by pulling base 25 proximally over the distal end
 of endoscope 10 and then pulling proximally along the length of endoscope 10
 until the distal end of sleeve 15 is substantially aligned with the distal tip of
 endoscope 10. At this point, aft balloon 20 is deflated, fore balloon 35 is deflated,
 and fore balloon 35 is docked over the distal end of endoscope 10, with
 endoscope 10 nesting in the area beneath raised push tube bridge 31. Endoscope
  10 and apparatus 5 are ready to be inserted as a unit into the patient.
          Looking next at Fig. 89, endoscope 10 and apparatus 5 are inserted as a
 unit into a body lumen and/or body cavity of the patient. By way of example but
 not limitation, endoscope 10 and apparatus 5 are inserted as a unit into the
 gastrointestinal (GI) tract of the patient. Endoscope 10 and apparatus 5 are
 advanced along the body lumen and/or body cavity to a desired location within
 the patient (Figs. 90 and 91).
          When apparatus 5 is to be used (e.g., to manipulate the side wall of the
 gastrointestinal tract so as to provide increased visualization of the same and/or

WO 2016/193820                                                             PCT/IB2016/000869
                                            56
 increase access to the same, and/or for stabilizing instruments relative to the
 same), aft balloon 20 is inflated so as to stabilize apparatus 5 (and hence
 endoscope 10) within the body lumen and/or body cavity. See Fig. 92. This may
 be done using the aforementioned associated inflation mechanism 40.
         In this respect it will be appreciated that inasmuch as the articulating
 portion of the endoscope resides distal to aft balloon 20, the endoscope will be
 able to articulate distal to aft balloon 20 so as to facilitate visualization of the
 anatomy even after aft balloon 20 is inflated. Significantly, such visualization is
 enhanced, inasmuch as aft balloon 20 stabilizes endoscope 10 within the
 gastrointestinal tract and distends the colon and increases the colon to a fixed
 diameter directly adjacent to aft balloon 20.
         Next, hollow push tubes 30 are advanced distally in the body lumen and/or
 body cavity (i.e., so as to move fore balloon 35 further ahead of aft balloon 20) by
 pushing distally on push tube handle 37. Thus, hollow push tubes 30, and hence
 fore balloon 35, move distally relative to endoscope 10 (which is stabilized in
 position within the gastrointestinal tract by the inflated aft balloon 20). Note that
 raised push tube bridge 31 provides an atraumatic tip for the distal ends of hollow
 push tubes 30, thereby ensuring atraumatic advancement of fore balloon 35. Note
 that the deflated fore balloon 35 covers the distal ends of hollow push tubes 30
 and raised push tube bridge 31 during such distal advancement of fore balloon 35,
 thereby ensuring atraumatic advancement of fore balloon 35. Note that
 atraumatic advancement of fore balloon 35 may be further enhanced by forming
 the distal ends of hollow push tubes 30 and raised push tube bridge 31 out of a
 more resilient material.
         When hollow push tubes 30 have advanced fore balloon 35 to the desired
 position distal to endoscope 10, fore balloon 35 is inflated (Fig. 93) so as to
 secure fore balloon 35 to the anatomy. Again, this may be done using the
 aforementioned associated inflation mechanism 40. As fore balloon 35 is

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           57
 inflated, the inflated fore balloon 35, the inflated aft balloon 20, and hollow push
 tubes 30 will all complement one another so as to stabilize, straighten, expand
 and/or flatten the side wall of the body lumen and/or body cavity so as to better
 present the side wall tissue (including visualization of areas which may be
 initially hidden from view or outside the field of view) for examination and/or
 treatment during an endoscopic procedure using endoscope 10. In this respect it
 will be appreciated that the inflated fore balloon 35 and the inflated aft balloon 20
 will together expand and tension the side wall of the body lumen and/or body
 cavity, and hollow push tubes 30 will tend to straighten the anatomy between the
 two inflated balloons when the fore balloon is extended distally from the aft
 balloon. In this respect it will also be appreciated that once aft balloon 20 and
 fore balloon 35 have both been inflated, fore balloon 35 will create a substantially
 full-diameter seal across the body lumen and/or body cavity (because the inflated
 fore balloon closes down the axial opening 63 extending through the fore balloon
 when the fore balloon is in its deflated state), and aft balloon 20 will cooperate
 with sleeve 15 and endoscope 10 to create another substantially full-diameter
 barrier across the body lumen and/or body cavity. Thus, the inflated fore balloon
 35 and the inflated aft balloon 20 will together define a substantially closed region
 along the body lumen and/or body cavity (i.e., an isolated therapeutic zone which
 prevents the passage of fluid and/or other liquids by virtue of the air-tight seals
 established by the inflated fore balloon 35 and aft balloon 20). The side wall of
 the body lumen and/or body cavity will be tensioned by inflation of fore balloon
 35 and aft balloon 20, whereby to better present the side wall of the body lumen
 and/or body cavity for viewing through endoscope 10.
          It should be appreciated that the expansion and tensioning of the side wall
 of the body lumen and/or body cavity effected by the inflated fore balloon 35, the
 inflated aft balloon 20, and hollow push tubes 30, can be further enhanced by
 advancing the fore balloon when it is inflated and gripping the side wall of the

WO 2016/193820                                                              PCT/IB2016/000869
                                             58
 body lumen and/or body cavity, whereby to further tension the side wall of the
 body lumen and/or body cavity.
          Significantly, inasmuch as the inflated fore balloon 35 and the inflated aft
 balloon 20 together define a substantially closed region along the body lumen
 and/or body cavity (i.e., an isolated therapeutic zone), this region can then be
 inflated (Fig. 24) with a fluid (e.g., air, C0 2, etc.) so as to further tension the side
 wall of the body lumen and/or body cavity, whereby to better present the side wall
 of the body lumen and/or body cavity for viewing through endoscope 10 and
 stabilize the side wall so as to facilitate more precise therapeutic interventions.
          If desired, fore balloon 35 can be retracted toward aft balloon 20 (i.e., by
 pulling push tube handle 37 proximally), while remaining inflated (and hence
 maintaining a grip on the side wall of the body lumen and/or body cavity), so as
 to move the visible mucosa and further improve visualization and access (see Fig.
 95), e.g., so as to position a particular target area on the side wall of the body
 lumen and/or body cavity at a convenient angle relative to the endoscope and
 endoscopic tools.
          Alternatively, if desired, once aft balloon 35 has been inflated, hollow
 push tubes 30 may be advanced distally a portion - but only a portion - of their
 full distal stroke, then fore balloon 35 may be inflated so as to grip the side wall
 of the body lumen and/or body cavity, and then hollow push tubes 30 may be
 further advanced distally. This action will cause flexible hollow push tubes 30 to
 bow outwardly (see Figs. 96-99), contacting the side wall of the body lumen
 and/or body cavity and pushing the side wall of the body lumen and/or body
 cavity outwardly, e.g., in a "tenting" fashion, whereby to further enhance
 visualization of the side wall of the body lumen and/or body cavity by endoscope
  10.
          If desired, instruments 190 (Fig. 100) may be advanced through working
 channels of endoscope 10 so as to biopsy and/or treat pathologic conditions (e.g.,

WO 2016/193820                                                            PCT/IB2016/000869
                                             59
 excise pathological anatomy). It will be appreciated that such instruments will
 extend through the distal end of the endoscope, which is effectively stabilized
 relative to the anatomy via aft balloon 20, so that the working ends of instruments
  190 will also be highly stabilized relative to the anatomy. This is a significant
 advantage over the prior art practice of advancing instruments out of the non
 stabilized end of an endoscope. Preferably instruments 190 include articulating
 instruments having a full range of motion, whereby to better access target
 anatomy.
          Furthermore, if bleeding were to obscure a tissue site, or if bleeding were
 to occur and the surgeon is unable to identify the source of the bleeding, the
 isolated therapeutic zone permits rapid flushing of the anatomic segment in which
 the therapeutic zone lies (e.g., with a liquid such as saline) with rapid subsequent
 removal of the flushing liquid (see Figs. 101-103).
          Also, if desired, fore balloon 35 can be directed with high precision to a
 bleeding site, whereupon fore balloon 35 may be used (e.g., inflated) to apply
 local pressure to the bleeding site in order to enhance bleeding control (see Fig.
  104). This can be done under the visualization provided by endoscope 10.
          If it is desired to reposition endoscope 10 within the anatomy with
 minimal interference from apparatus 5, fore balloon 35 is returned to its torus
 configuration (i.e., partially deflated), the fore balloon is retracted proximally and
 "re-docked" on the distal end of endoscope 10 (with endoscope 10 nesting in the
 area beneath raised push tube bridge 31), aft balloon 20 is deflated, and then
 endoscope 10 (with apparatus 5 carried thereon) is repositioned within the
 anatomy. Note that where fore balloon 35 is to be re-docked on the distal end of
 endoscope 10, fore balloon 35 is preferably only partially deflated until fore
 balloon 35 is re-docked on the distal end of the endoscope, since partial inflation
 of fore balloon 35 can leave fore balloon 35 with enough "body" to facilitate the

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869
                                             60
 re-docking process. Thereafter, fore balloon 35 may be fully deflated if desired,
 e.g., so as to positively grip the distal end of endoscope 10.
          Alternatively, if desired, fore balloon 35 may be used as a drag brake to
 control retrograde motion of the endoscope. More particularly, in this form of the
 invention, endoscope 10 and apparatus 5 are first advanced as a unit into the body
 lumen and/or body cavity until the tip of the endoscope is at the proper location.
 Next, aft balloon 20 is inflated, hollow push tubes 30 are advanced distally, and
 then fore balloon 35 is inflated (Fig. 105). Visualization and, optionally,
 therapeutic treatment may then be effected at that location. When the apparatus is
 to be moved retrograde, aft balloon 20 is deflated, fore balloon 35 is partially
 deflated, and then the endoscope is withdrawn proximally, dragging the semi
 inflated fore balloon 35 along the body lumen and/or body cavity (Fig. 106), with
 fore balloon 35 acting as something of a brake as the endoscope is pulled
 proximally, thereby enabling more controlled retrograde movement of the
 endoscope and hence better visualization of the anatomy. If at some point it is
 desired, aft balloon 20 and fore balloon 35 can be re-inflated, as shown in Fig.
  107, with or without introduction of a fluid into the "isolated therapeutic zone"
 established between the two balloons, so as to stabilize, straighten, expand and/or
 flatten the anatomy.
          It is also possible to use aft balloon 20 as a brake when withdrawing the
 endoscope (and hence apparatus 5) from the anatomy, either alone or in
 combination with the aforementioned braking action from fore balloon 35.
          At the conclusion of the procedure, endoscope 10 and apparatus 5 are
 withdrawn from the anatomy. Preferably this is done by deflating (or partially
 deflating) fore balloon 35, retracting hollow push tubes 30 so that fore balloon 35
 is "re-docked" onto the distal end of endoscope 10 (with endoscope 10 nesting in
 the area beneath raised push tube bridge 31), fully deflating fore balloon 35 so
 that it grips the distal end of the endoscope, deflating aft balloon 20 (if it is not yet

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869
                                             61
 deflated), and then withdrawing endoscope 10 and apparatus 5 as a unit from the
 anatomy.
         It should be appreciated that apparatus 5 may also be used advantageously
 in various ways other than those disclosed above. By way of example but not
 limitation, when endoscope 10 (and apparatus 5) is to be advanced within the
 colon, it may be desirable to first project fore balloon 35 distally under visual
 guidance of the endoscope so that fore balloon 35 leads the distal end of the
 endoscope. As a result, when the endoscope is advanced distally, with fore
 balloon 35 being deflated (or partially deflated), the fore balloon and flexible
 hollow push tubes 30 (and raised push tube bridge 31) may act as an atraumatic
 lead (guiding structure) for the endoscope as the endoscope advances through the
 colon. Significantly, inasmuch as the distal ends of hollow push tubes 30 are
 preferably highly flexible, as the advancing fore balloon 35 encounters the colon
 wall (e.g., at a turn of the colon), the flexible hollow push tubes can deflect so that
 the fore balloon tracks the path of the colon, thereby aiding atraumatic
 advancement of the endoscope along the colon. It should also be appreciated that
 apparatus 5 may also be used advantageously in other ways to facilitate further
 examinations of the luminal surface otherwise difficult to be performed currently.
 Such an example is endoscopic ultrasound examination of the lumen which would
 be facilitated by the fluid-filled inflated fore balloon and ultrasound probe
 examination.

         Aft balloon 20 is bonded to sleeve 15 along at least the distal edge of aft
 balloon 20 and the proximal edge of aft balloon 20 (i.e., the distal and proximal
 edges where aft balloon 20 meets sleeve 15), such that an airtight seal is created
 between aft balloon 20 and sleeve 15. Pushrod lumens 52 and aft balloon

WO 2016/193820                                                             PCT/IB2016/000869

 inflation lumen 47 are disposed in contact with, and parallel to, sleeve 15, with
 pushrod lumens 52 passing entirely through aft balloon 20 (i.e., through both the
 proximal and distal edges of aft balloon 20 where aft balloon 20 meets sleeve 15)
 and with aft balloon inflation lumen 47 passing through the proximal edge of aft
 balloon 20 and extending into the interior of aft balloon 20. As a result, aft
 balloon 20 must be sealingly bonded to sleeve 15 about a series of components
 (i.e., pushrod lumens 52 and aft balloon inflation lumen 47) which collectively
 present a non-circular cross-sectional profile at the bonding sites.
          In practice, it has been found that it is challenging to effect airtight thermal
 bonding of aft balloon 20 to sleeve 15, inasmuch as the presence of pushrod
 lumens 52 and aft balloon inflation lumen 47 create open wedges (or corners)
 which the material of aft balloon 20 must fill in order to ensure airtight bonding of
 aft balloon 20 to sleeve 15.
          More particularly, and looking now at Fig. 108, gaps 1100 exist in the
 space between pushrod lumens 52 and sleeve 15, gap 1105 exists in the space
 between aft balloon inflation lumen 47 and sleeve 15, and gaps 1110 exist in the
 space between a pushrod lumen 52 and aft balloon inflation lumen 47. The
 presence of gaps 1100, 1105 and 1110 at the proximal edge of aft balloon 20, and
 the presence of gaps 1100 at the distal edge of aft balloon 20, compromise the
 airtight sealing of aft balloon 20 to sleeve 15, since it is difficult to make the
 material of aft balloon 20 adhere to the irregular perimeter defined by pushrod
 lumens 52 and aft balloon inflation lumen 47. Stated another way, it can be
 challenging to make the material of aft balloon 20 enter into gaps 1100, 1105 and
  1110.
          Thus it would be desirable to provide a new and improved means to fill
 gaps 1100, 1105 and 1110 so that aft balloon 20 can be thermally bonded to
 sleeve 15 in an airtight sealing engagement.

 there are provided novel extruded inserts 1115 which have a cross-sectional
 profile matching the aforementioned gaps 1100. Extruded inserts 1115 are sized
 to fill gaps 1100 at the location where the proximal edge of aft balloon 20 and the
 distal edge of aft balloon 20 are bonded to sleeve 15 around pushrod lumens 52.
 Extruded inserts 1110 are preferably flexible and may be of any desired length
 (e.g., extruded inserts 1115 may extend along substantially the entire length of
 sleeve 15, or extruded inserts 1115 may extend only along a portion of sleeve 15
 where aft balloon 20 is bonded to sleeve 15, or a plurality of extruded inserts 1115

 distal to aft balloon 20 to a location just proximal to aft balloon 20.

           It should be appreciated that where additional components/lumens (e.g.,
 working channels) are disposed coaxially about sleeve 15, additional extruded
 inserts 1115, 1120, 1125, etc. may be provided, and/or other extruded inserts of
 different sizes and/or cross-sectional profiles may be provided, without departing
 from the scope of the present invention.
                           Improved Fore Balloon Construction
           With the "double eversion" fore balloon construction discussed above,
 fore balloon 35 is formed as a hollow balloon body 67 having two extensions (i.e.,
 proximal extension 73 and distal extension 76) which are both everted inwardly
 (i.e., the proximal extension is everted first, the distal extension is everted second)
 into the interior of body 67 and thermally bonded together to form fore balloon
 35. With this approach, fore balloon 35 comprises a torus, whereby to facilitate
 docking of fore balloon 35 over the distal end of sleeve 15 (i.e., the distal end of
 endoscope 10) when fore balloon 35 is in its deflated condition. At the same

WO 2016/193820                                                        PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           65
 time, fore balloon 35 can provide a full-diameter barrier across an anatomical
 passageway when fore balloon 35 is in its inflated condition.
          However, it has been found that it can be challenging to effect good
 thermal bonding between inwardly-everted proximal extension 73 and inwardly
 everted distal extension 76, inasmuch as both proximal extension 73 and distal
 extension 76 are located within the interior body 67 of fore balloon 35 during
 bonding, and therefore can be difficult to access during component bonding.
          One solution to this problem, and looking now at Figs. 115-119, is the
 provision of an alternative fore balloon 35A. Fore balloon 35A is manufactured
 as a single construct comprising a body 67A having a proximal opening 69A and
 a distal opening 71A, a proximal extension 73A having a "key-shaped" cross
 section comprising lobes 74A, and a distal extension 76A having a circular cross
 section. Note that lobes 74A of proximal extension 73A have a configuration that
 matches the configuration of hollow push tubes 30 (i.e., where apparatus 5
 comprises two hollow push tubes 30 diametrically opposed to one another,
 proximal extension 73A comprises two lobes 74A diametrically opposed to one
 another - for the purposes of the present invention, proximal extension 73A and
 lobe(s) 74A may be collectively referred to as having a "key-shaped" cross
 section). Proximal extension 73A is relatively short and is preferably flared
 outwardly at its proximal end, whereby to facilitate docking of fore balloon 35A
 over sleeve 15 and/or endoscope 10 as will hereinafter be discussed in greater
 detail. Furthermore, proximal extension 73A preferably comprises a proximally
 extending tongue 77 for facilitating docking of fore balloon 35A over the
 proximal end of sleeve 15 (and/or the proximal end of endoscope 10).
          Thus it will be appreciated that fore balloon 35A is formed in a manner
 generally similar to the aforementioned fore balloon 35, except that proximal
 extension 73A of fore balloon 35A differs from the aforementioned proximal

WO 2016/193820                                                        PCT/IB2016/000869
                                          66
 extension 73 of fore balloon 73 (i.e., by being formed with a shorter length, a
 flared proximal end and a tongue 77).
          Fore balloon 35A is also assembled in a somewhat different manner than
 the aforementioned fore balloon 35, as will hereinafter be discussed in greater
 detail. More particularly, and looking now at Figs. 120-122, hollow push tubes
 30 are seated in lobes 74A of proximal extension 73A, with proximal extension
 73A extending proximally away from fore balloon 35A and with distal extension
 76 extending distally away from fore balloon 35A. Hollow push tubes 30 are
 advanced distally into the interior of body 67A of fore balloon 35A such that the
 interiors of hollow push tubes 30 are in fluid communication with the interior of
 body 67A and with raised push tube bridge 31 disposed within the interior of
 body 67A. If desired, an assembly mandrel M may be used during assembly in
 order to provide support for the components during insertion of hollow push tubes
 30 into fore balloon 35A of fore balloon 35A (see Fig. 120).
          Next, processing mandrel M is removed (if one is used), and distal
 extension 76A is everted into the interior of body 67A of fore balloon 35A and
 passed proximally through body 67A, and through the interior of proximal
 extension 73A, until distal extension 76A extends to the proximal opening of
 proximal extension 73A. As a result of this construction, proximal extension 76A
 extends through body 67A, and both proximal extension 73A and distal extension
 76A extend proximally away from body 67A of fore balloon 35A, and push tubes
 30 are disposed between proximal extension 73A and distal extension 76A
 proximal to body 67A of fore balloon 35A. Thus, in this form of the invention,
 proximal extension 73A is not everted into the interior of fore balloon 35A,
 rather, proximal extension 73A remains extending proximally away from fore
 balloon 35.

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           67
         Proximal extension 73A and distal extension 76A are then bonded
 together at their proximal ends, with push tubes 30 being sealed therebetween,
 such that airtight thermal bonding is effected.
         As a result of the foregoing, fore balloon 35A has a toroidal configuration,
 comprising a boy 67 having a center opening formed by (i) proximal extension
 73A/everted distal extension 76A on the proximal side of body 67A, and (ii)
 everted distal extension 76A within the interior of body 67A.
         Significantly, this form of the invention results in fore balloon 35A having
 a toroidal shape which does not require thermal bonding to be carried out within
 the interior of body 67A of fore balloon 35A, thereby simplifying assembly.
 Furthermore, by forming proximal extension 73A as a relatively short structure
 having an outwardly flared proximal end, and by providing tongue 77 on the
 proximal edge of proximal extension 73A, proximal extension 73A can facilitate
 docking of fore balloon 35A over sleeve 15 and/or endoscope 10.
         If desired, and looking now at Fig. 123, novel extruded inserts 1130 may
 be provided alongside hollow push tubes 30 so as to facilitate bonding hollow
 push tubes 30 to proximal extension 73A and to the everted distal extension 76A.
         Furthermore, if desired, additional material and/or extrusions may be
 provided along either (or both of) proximal extension 73A and distal extension
 76A, and/or around the proximal opening of proximal extension 73A, so as to
 provide increased rigidity to those portions of fore balloon 35A.
               Forming The Aft Balloon With An Everted Construction
         If desired, aft balloon 20 may be formed with an everted construction.
 More particularly, and looking now at Figs. 124 and 125, there is shown an aft
 balloon 20A which generally comprises a distal extension 1135 and a proximal
 extension 1140. During construction, distal extension 1135 is everted back
 through the center of aft balloon 20A so as to form a generally toroidal balloon

WO 2016/193820                                                         PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           68
 structure which is secured to sleeve 15. In this form of the invention, a tube 1145
 has its distal end 1150 disposed exterior to the everted distal extension 1135, and
 interior to the outside wall of aft balloon 20A, and its proximal end 1155
 connected to the aforementioned proximal inflation/deflation tube 45, so that air
 (or another fluid) can be introduced into aft balloon 20A and removed from aft
 balloon 20A.
                                Additional Constructions
          If desired, apparatus 5 may be constructed so that hollow push tubes 30
 may be advanced or retracted, to a limited extent, independently of one another,
 as well as in conjunction with one another - such limited independent
 advancement or retraction of hollow push tubes 30 can aid in steering the
 partially- or fully-deflated fore balloon 35 through the body lumen and/or body
 cavity, whereby to facilitate advancement or retraction of endoscope 10 through
 the body lumen and/or body cavity, and/or such independent advancement or
 retraction of hollow push tubes 30 can facilitate applying a "turning force" to the
 anatomy with an inflated fore balloon 35, whereby to better present the anatomy
 for visualization and/or treatment.
          By way of example but not limitation, in this form of the invention, and
 looking now at Fig. 126, hollow push tubes 30 are each independently slidably
 mounted to push tube handle 37 so that hollow push tubes 30 can move, to some
 extent, independently of push tube handle 37 and each other. Stops 191 limit
 distal movement of hollow push tubes 30 relative to push tube handle 37 so that a
 hollow push tube cannot be moved completely out of push tube handle 37. As a
 result of this construction, when fore balloon 35 is to be moved distally, hollow
 push tubes 30 are moved distally, either together or, to the extent allowed by
 raised push tube bridge 31, independently of one another. And when fore balloon
 35 is to be moved proximally, hollow push tubes 30 are moved proximally, either

WO 2016/193820                                                           PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           69
 together or independently of one another, to the extent allowed by raised push
 tube bridge 31. At any point in a procedure, hollow push tubes 30 can be moved,
 to the extent allowed by raised push tube bridge 31, independently of one another
 so as to "turn" the fore balloon, e.g., such as when fore balloon 35 is inflated and
 engaging the anatomy, whereby to apply a "turning force" to the anatomy, or
 where fore balloon 35 is partially inflated and is being used as an atraumatic tip
 for the advancing assembly, whereby to help "steer" the assembly through the
 anatomy. Note that raised push tube bridge 31 at the distal ends of hollow push
 tubes 30 provides a limiting mechanism to limit the extent to which hollow push
 tubes 30 may be moved, longitudinally, independently of one another, in order to
 prevent excessive turning of fore balloon 35, and/or hollow push tube cross-over,
 and/or hollow push tube entanglement, and/or hollow push tube misalignment,
 etc. Note also that hollow push tubes 30 may be held in a particular disposition
 by mounting hollow push tubes 30 in the aforementioned clamp 53 (Figs. 37 and
 60).
          It should also be appreciated that it is possible to modify the construction
 of sleeve 15 so as to support instruments (or hollow instrument guide tubes)
 external to endoscope 10. More particularly, looking again at Figs. 5 and 6, it will
 be seen that in the construction shown in Figs. 5 and 6, sleeve 15 comprises a
 lumen 47 for receiving inflation/deflation tube 45 for inflating/deflating aft
 balloon 20, and a pair of lumens 52 for receiving support tubes 50 which receive
 push tubes 30 for manipulating and inflating/deflating fore balloon 35. However,
 if desired, sleeve 15 may include additional lumens for supporting instruments (or
 hollow instrument guide tubes) external to endoscope 10.
          More particularly, and looking now at Fig. 127, there is shown an end
 view of another form of sleeve 15 which includes a plurality of lumens 195 for
 slidably receiving instruments 190 therein. Note that, when inflated, aft balloon
 20 provides a secure platform for maintaining endoscope 10 and sleeve 15 within

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           70
 a body lumen or body cavity, with endoscope 10 and sleeve 15 centered within
 the body lumen or body cavity. As a result, the distal ends of lumens 195 of
 sleeve 15 will also be securely maintained within the body lumen or body cavity
 so as to provide a secure support for instruments advanced through lumens 195 of
 sleeve 15.
          The proximal ends of lumens 195 may extend to, and through, base 25, in
 which case instruments may be inserted into lumens 195 at base 25, or the
 proximal ends of lumens 195 may terminate proximal to base 25 (but still outside
 the body of the patient), in which case instruments may be inserted into lumens
  195 intermediate sleeve 15. By way of example but not limitation, where
 endoscope 10 is 180 cm in length and instruments 190 are 60 cm in length, it can
 be advantageous to insert instruments 190 into lumens 195 at a point closer to
 balloons 20, 35 (rather than at base 25). Note that in Fig. 127, the lumen 47 for
 receiving inflation/deflation tube 45 and inflation/deflation tube 45 for
 inflating/deflating aft balloon 20 are not visible, since the view is distal-facing
 and is taken at a location distal to where lumen 47 and inflation/deflation tube 45
 terminate on sleeve 15.
          Figs. 128-131 show various instruments 190 extending out of lumens 195.
 Note that instruments 190 preferably comprise articulating instruments, e.g.,
 graspers 190A in Figs 128-13 1, a cauterizing device 190B in Figs. 128-129,
 scissors 190C in Figs. 130 and 131, and a suction device 190D in Figs. 128-13 1.
          It should be appreciated that where sleeve 15 comprises its central
 passageway for receiving endoscope 10, lumen 47 for receiving inflation/deflation
 tube 45, lumens 52 for receiving support tubes 50 which receive hollow push
 tubes 30, and/or lumens 195 for slidably receiving instruments 190 therein, sleeve
  15 is preferably formed by an extrusion process.
          In one preferred form of the invention, lumen 47 for receiving
 inflation/deflation tube 45, lumens 52 for receiving support tubes 50 which

WO 2016/193820                                                         PCT/IB2016/000869
                                           71
 receive hollow push tubes 30, and/or lumens 195 for slidably receiving
 instruments 190 may have a fixed configuration (i.e., a fixed diameter), so that
 sleeve 15 has a fixed outer profile.
          In another preferred form of the invention, lumen 47 for receiving
 inflation/deflation tube 45, lumens 52 for receiving support tubes 50 which
 receive hollow push tubes 30, and/or lumens 195 for slidably receiving
 instruments 190 may have an expandable configuration (i.e., they may have a
 minimal profile when empty and expand diametrically as needed when filled), so
 that the overall profile of sleeve 15 is minimized.
          It should also be appreciated that where sleeve 15 comprises a plurality of
 lumens 195 for slidably receiving instruments 190 therein, it can be desirable to
 provide greater structural integrity to the distal ends of lumens 195 so as to
 provide improved support for the instruments 190 received within lumens 195.
 To this end, a support ring may be provided at the distal end of sleeve 15, wherein
 the support ring provides openings for the passage of hollow push tubes 30 and
 openings for the passage of instruments 190. Note that the openings in such a
 support ring for the passage of instruments 190 preferably make a close fit with
 the instruments so as to provide excellent instrument support at the distal end of
 sleeve 15.
          Alternatively and/or additionally, lumens 195 may accommodate hollow
 instrument guide tubes which themselves accommodate instruments therein. Such
 hollow instrument guide tubes can provide greater structural integrity to the distal
 ends of lumens 195 so as to provide improved support for the instruments 190
 received within lumens 195.
          And such hollow instrument guide tubes may be of fixed geometry or of
 bendable or articulating geometry. See, for example, Fig. 132, which shows
 hollow instrument guide tubes 200 extending out of lumens 195 and receiving
 instruments 190 therein. Note that hollow instrument guide tubes 200 may be

WO 2016/193820                                                           PCT/IB2016/000869
                                            72
 independently movable relative to one another (and independently movable
 relative to sleeve 15). Note also that instruments 190 preferably make a close fit
 with hollow instrument guide tubes 200 so as to provide excellent instrument
 support at the distal end of sleeve 15.
         In another form of the present invention, the toroidal construction of fore
 balloon 35 may be replaced by a "conventional" balloon construction, i.e., by a
 balloon having a substantially uniform, full-diameter cross-section. In this form
 of the invention, the deflated fore balloon is not "docked" over the endoscope
 during insertion - instead, the deflated fore balloon resides alongside the
 endoscope during insertion; and in this form of the invention, the fore balloon is
 not "re-docked" back over the endoscope during withdrawal - instead, the balloon
 resides distal to the endoscope (or alongside the endoscope) during withdrawal. It
 will be appreciated that, in this form of the invention, the raised push tube bridge
 31 can help retain the deflated fore balloon alongside the endoscope.
                                       Applications
         Thus it will be seen that the present invention comprises the provision and
 use of novel apparatus for manipulating the side wall of a body lumen and/or
 body cavity so as to better present the side wall tissue (including visualization of
 areas which may be initially hidden from view or outside the field of view) for
 examination and/or treatment during an endoscopic procedure, e.g., to straighten
 bends, "iron out" inner luminal surface folds and create a substantially static or
 stable side wall of the body lumen and/or body cavity which enables more precise
 visual examination (including visualization of areas which may be initially hidden
 from view or outside the field of view) and/or therapeutic intervention. By way
 of example but not limitation, the novel apparatus can be used to stabilize,
 straighten, expand and/or flatten bends and/or curves and/or folds in the side wall
 of the intestine so as to better present the side wall tissue (including visualization

WO 2016/193820                                                          PCT/IB2016/000869
                                            73
 of areas which may be initially hidden from view or outside the field of view) for
 examination and/or treatment during an endoscopic procedure.
          The present invention also comprises the provision and use of novel
 apparatus capable of steadying and/or stabilizing the distal tips and/or working
 ends of instruments (e.g., endoscopes, articulating and/or non-articulating devices
 such as graspers, cutters or dissectors, cauterizing tools, ultrasound probes, etc.)
 inserted into a body lumen and/or body cavity during an endoscopic procedure
 with respect to the side wall of the body lumen and/or body cavity, whereby to
 facilitate the precision use of those instruments.
          By way of example but not limitation, the present apparatus can provide a
 stable platform (i.e., a stable endoscope, stable therapeutic tools and a stable colon
 wall, all stable with respect to one another) for the performance of numerous
 minimally-invasive procedures within a body lumen and/or body cavity, including
 the stabilization of an endoscope and/or other surgical instruments (e.g., graspers,
 cutters or dissectors, cauterizing tools, ultrasound probes, etc.) within the body
 lumen and/or body cavity, e.g., during a lesion biopsy and/or lesion removal
 procedure, an organ resection procedure, endoscopic submucosal dissection
 (ESD), endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), etc., while at the same time
 stabilizing the colon (including decreasing deformation of the colon wall) so as to
 enable more precise visualization, intervention and/or surgery.
          Significantly, the present invention provides novel apparatus capable of
 steadying and/or stabilizing the distal tips and/or working ends of endoscopes
 (and hence also steadying and/or stabilizing the distal tips and/or working ends of
 other instruments inserted through the working channels of those endoscopes,
 such as graspers, cutters or dissectors, cauterizing tools, ultrasound probes, etc.)
 with respect to the side wall of the body lumen and/or body cavity, and stabilizing
 the side wall of the body lumen and/or body cavity relative to these instruments.

WO 2016/193820                                                            PCT/IB2016/000869
                                             74
         And the present invention provides novel apparatus capable of steadying
 and/or stabilizing the distal tips and/or working ends of instruments (such as
 graspers, cutters or dissectors, cauterizing tools, ultrasound probes, etc.) advanced
 to the surgical site by means other than through the working channels of
 endoscopes.
         The novel apparatus of the present invention can be used in substantially
 any endoscopic procedure to facilitate the alignment and presentation of tissue
 during an endoscopic procedure and/or to stabilize the working end of an
 endoscope (and/or other instruments advanced through the endoscope) relative to
 tissue or to assist in the advancement of the endoscope during such a procedure.
         The present invention is believed to have widest applications with respect
 to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (e.g., large and small intestines, esophagus,
 stomach, etc.), which is generally characterized by frequent turns and which has a
 side wall characterized by numerous folds and disease processes located on and
 between these folds. However, the methods and apparatus of the present
 invention may also be used inside other body lumens (e.g., blood vessels,
 lymphatic vessels, the urinary tract, fallopian tubes, bronchi, bile ducts, etc.)
 and/or inside other body cavities (e.g., the head, chest, abdomen, nasal sinuses,
 bladder, cavities within organs, etc.).
                                        Modifications
         While the present invention has been described in terms of certain
 exemplary preferred embodiments, it will be readily understood and appreciated
 by those skilled in the art that it is not so limited, and that many additions,
 deletions and modifications may be made to the preferred embodiments discussed
 above while remaining within the scope of the present invention.
