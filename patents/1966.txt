       IMPROVEMENTS TO EQUIPMENT AND METHODS FOR DOWNHOLE
      SURVEYING AND DATA ACQUISITION FOR A DRILLING OPERATION
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]       The present invention relates to equipment, system and methods for
improved downhole surveying and data acquisition at a drill site, such as for
obtaining a core orientation sample and handling data relating to the sample.
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
[0002] Drillers contracted by mining companies are required to drill numbers of
exploratory subsurface drill holes at a chosen mine site to extract underground
core samples in order to determine locations of mineralisation and the feasibility
to proceed with mineral extraction.
[0003]       Such operations extract a core during drilling (in 'diamond drill-bit
drilling' the bit has a centre hole which allows the core sample to enter through
during drilling). Core lengths are variable, but usually between 3m and 6m
lengths and are extracted progressively for the entire hole.
[0004]       Each extracted core sample is marked for its orientation position
before extraction, with additional survey data of that cores position such as
azimuth (angle of North-South deviation), dip angle, depth the core was extracted
from and other additional data to verify data correctness. Financial costs
associated with such operations are based on distance (metres) drilled, number
of holes, sub-surface targets reached and number of targets concluded.
[0005]       Drill-rig activity:
[0006]       1) Equipment needed to achieve the above basic requirements

                                              2
[0007]       Inventory of instrumentation and ancillary equipment required to carry
out drilling activity such as surveying and core orientation. These pieces of
equipment and sub-assemblies have to be possibly transported to remote
locations by air cargo, helicopter or by road. In remote areas suitable for mining
and drilling operations, such roads are often unsealed and within harsh
environmental conditions.
[0008]       2) Extracting core samples during drilling
[0009]       a) A core-orientation unit is attached to a 'back-end assembly', which is
inserted into a drill hole during drilling and is brought to the surface when the core
sample is extracted with the core orientation unit.
[0010]       b) The core orientation unit needs to be removed (unscrewed) from the
back-end assembly to begin the process of orienting the extracted core. The core
is removed after orientation marking, and then the core orientation unit is re
installed to the back-end assembly before inserting into the drill hole for the next
core sample extraction. This process is time consuming and costly considering
the high cost of the drill rig on-site and that this process is repeated every 3 or 6
metres of drilling. Drilling depths are usually between 500 metres and 2 km, with
deeper drilling expected in the future. To speed up the process, a pair of core
orientation units are used on two identical assemblies and alternated when drilling
for core samples, however the operator still needs to go through the motion of
removing and re-installing the core orientation unit for every sample retrieved.
[0011]       c) As drilling depths increases, the drill bit size is reduced to cope with
the deeper hole drilling, as a consequence, a smaller size diameter core
orientation unit is required to follow the reduced hole size. As a norm, drillers
need to have three sizes of core orientation units, two of each size, making a total
of six core orientation units. These units are usually made of heavy thick walled
stainless steel to withstand high pressures during deep hole drilling. This adds
substantial weight to the core orientation equipment inventory.

                                              3
[0012]     3) Surveying the drill hole at different depths
[0013]     a) In order to identify the exact underground locations of each
extracted core sample, a number of surveys of the drill hole need to be carried
out in between the drilling and core extraction process. A survey instrument is
used in the drill hole to measure azimuth, hole inclination (or dip), and other data.
As a minimum, hole surveys need to be taken every 30 metres of drilling. The
hole path/trajectory is then extrapolated mathematically and the extracted 6m
core samples positioning is then calculated from the plotted path.
[0014]      b) The process of surveying a drill hole at a determined depth involves
inserting a 'Survey instrument probe' into a pressure protected brass barrel,
attaching the probe pressure barrel to three lengths of 1.2m aluminium rod
extensions (to avoid anomalous magnetic readings when the probe is in close
proximity to the drill bit and steel drill pipe extensions), attaching the entire length
to a back-end assembly, which is then inserted into the end of the drilled hole and
through the hollowed centre of the circular drill bit. With the drill bit and steel
piping pulled back past the survey probe and the three rod extensions, a survey
reading can then be recorded at the last drilled position of the drill hole. This total
assembly including the survey probe, its brass pressure barrel and three
aluminium extension rods again adds substantial weight and considerable
assembly/disassembly time to the survey process.
[0015]     c) On retrieving the probe assembly, the probe needs to be removed
from the brass pressure barrel in order to retrieve the recorded survey readings
from the drill hole. This can be a lengthy process with added care required not to
damage the instrument during handling or being dropped in water or mud as
would normally be the condition at a drill-rig site.
[0016]     4) Maintaining a progressive drilling log

                                                4
[0017]         a) A mandatory requirement for all drilling activity is to record events,
activities, instrument data and progress/achievement of underground targets.
Traditionally (and still used in many drill rigs globally), the method of recording
and logging of drilling activity is carried out painstakingly using manual pen and
paper recording methods.
[0018]         b) The pieces of paper are compiled and manually checked for errors
or omissions, corrected after discussions with drill rig operators and on-site
geologists, and then sent to the drilling companies' administrative office for
manual transfer of data from the 'progressive log of drilling' sheets to computer
terminals.
[0019]         c) To accommodate for multiple site log data entry, there is usually a
pool of typists performing the data entry task. Having to re-enter data in this
manner can sometimes cause data errors which would then have to be re
checked and corrected as necessary. There is also the need to interpret the
handwritten sheets to ensure data is recorded in the required format so it can be
used by    3 rd party software programs which eventually provide billing to the mining
companies that contract the drilling companies.
[0020]         d) If sufficient detailed information can be recorded on the progressive
log of drilling sheet process, the drilling company has the added advantage of
extracting metrics from the recorded data that can provide a thorough analysis of
drill-rig costs (labour and consumables), efficiencies, safety issues etc. This
additional data is not always available due to insufficient data recording at the drill
rigs because of inaccessibility of the data or time constraints when drilling
towards underground targets within a limited time. Summary of current
operational methods used for basic activities at drill-rig sites to orient core
samples, measure survey data and record all activity at the drill rig site.
[0021]         To accomplish the above, drill-rig operators use core orientation tools,
survey probes and a number of manual pen and paper recording means to log

                                            5
drilling activity and events. Core orientation and Survey tools are available from a
number of different international suppliers and attempts have been made to
electronically record/log rig activity using 'Tough-books' and other commercially
available laptops and hand-held computers. The problems experienced from
present operating methods comes from having to manually record data from the
variety down-hole instruments source from various        3 rd party suppliers, which may
or may not have compatible formats, then transferring the data to the overall
manual logging sheets or laptop as required for eventual recording and billing to
customer.
[0022]       This current method is prone to human error, possible data
incompatibility and excessive time required to compile information which would
require further re-compilation at head office to include other neighbouring drill-rig
data and activity/events. Time delays and inherent inaccuracies as a result of
manual human data recording can cause delays in invoicing and receiving
payment, and at worst, not charging for all items due to missing or poor recording
methods.
[0023]       A further inconvenience to the driller is the need to keep an inventory
of third party core orientation/survey instruments, different manufacturer spare
parts and related consumables such as batteries, long and cumbersome brass
pressure barrels to protect survey instruments, sealing/waterproofing '0' rings
and grease to install associated pressure barrel housings before using the survey
probes. Apart from having to take stock of a large, and separately cased (if at all)
collection of instruments with associated hardware and consumables, the
operator has to gain familiarity with each instrument's method of operation and be
able to manually record and integrate the various data formats and results into a
common 'paper form' which can be later manually keyed in for geologist use or
accounting purposes.
[0024]       The present invention seeks to alleviate or overcome one or more of
the aforementioned problems.

                                             6
[0025]      With this in mind, it is desirable of one or more forms of the present
invention to provide a system or method that utilises a reduced number of
components compared with standard systems and which enables common
communication between various components.
[0026]      It is further desirable of one or more embodiments of the present
invention to make use of electronic hardware and software to reduce time and
cost, with a reduction in overall equipment count and weight and the capability to
simplify and streamline instrumentation and operator procedures.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0027]      One or more preferred forms of the present invention advantageously
reduces complex operational methods prevalent at most drill rig sites, such as
cumbersome handling and operation, incompatible equipment data outputs, and
keeping track of multiple activity and events while operating the drill rig according
to specified targets in a given time/cost budget.
[0028]      At least one embodiment of the present invention provides a system
incorporating reduced instrumentation component physical size(s) with the aid of
component/module miniaturisation. This reduction in physical size of components
allows for thicker wall pressure housings that enable component use in deep hole
exploration/drilling.
[0029]      Where preferred, use of composite materials may replace heavier
brass and steel housings, making it possible to package pieces of equipment into
one or more manageable (and preferably light weight) carrying cases. This adds
the further advantage of lower shipment costs and portability, while being able to
keep track of all components which fit into moulded receptacles in its carrying
case. The instruments and hardware components in a system according to one
or more embodiments of the present invention are built to be fully data and
function compatible, so much so that a (preferably hand-held) control device is

                                            7
able to be used to initiate, interrogate and control all the survey/core-orientation
instruments as well as log all drilling activity/events occurring at the rig.
[0030]      As a system that offers essential instrumentation required for drill site
measurement and logging, there is considerable reduction in size and the number
of pieces of equipment in the system compared to presently known and used
systems at mining drill-rig sites worldwide.
[0031]      The following are components of a system according to at least one
embodiment of the present invention that contribute to size reduction:
 a) Magnetic Survey instrument probe in a short length form less than 500mm,
     permanently encased in its own pressure barrel able to withstand pressures
     up to 6000 psi required for deep hole drilling applications. There is no need to
     dismantle the pressure barrel to operate or retrieve data from the probe.
 b) Compact but extendable lightweight 'rod extensions' to extend the Survey
     probe past the drill bit to avoid magnetic interference. Having a single short
     lightweight telescopically extendable piece is critical to keeping overall weight
     down. At present, the drilling industry typically uses three 1.2 metre
     solid/heavy aluminium rods joined together to achieve this.
 c) Lightweight composite material constructed dual core orientation instruments
     which can be started and after retrieval set up for core orientation, both
     without the need to be detached from the running gear/back-end
     assembly/core barrel.
 d) Adaptor attachments to each end of the core orientation instruments render
     the unit the capability to be used in all standard drill-hole sizes without having
     to stock different size instruments creating unnecessary duplication and
     additional space/weight. The attachments are compatible to LTK60, NQ, PQ,

                                              8
     HQ and HQ2 drill strings and other drill string sizes commonly used in the
     industry.
 e) A controller or communication device, preferably a hand held controller, (with
     additional optional pocket size slave controller) that is able to operate all of
     the instruments in the system as well as optionally record and log all events
     and activity occurring at the drill-rig site.
 f) An easily attachable hand controller/communicator charging device (e.g.
     mains power or charging from a vehicle battery) which also optionally
     incorporates a satellite modem communicator for instant transfer of site data
     and progress logging for analysis, multi-rig monitoring or accounting
     purposes.
[0032]      To further reduce human error and increase efficiency at the drill rig
site, the included common hand-held controller is able to directly record rig
operating conditions by optionally retrofitting rig instrumentation with compatible
wireless data interface modules. This enables fast and accurate rig status data
acquisition, further automating progressive log of drilling activity.
[0033]      The system and method of the present invention provides on-site
multiple function data integration of simultaneous activity occurring at the rig site
without the need for manual recording or calculations. Human error factors are
reduced leading to increased work efficiency and safety.
[0034]      An aspect of the present invention provides a survey system for
obtaining data from a drilling operation, the system including at least one core
orientation instrument for use in determining orientation of a core sample, at least
one downhole survey probe for use in determining characteristics relating to a
borehole created during a drilling operation, and a common single controller
configured to control or communicate with both the at least one survey probe and
the at least one core orientation instrument.

                                           9
[0035]      The controller may be arranged to capture survey data and core
orientation data, and to transmit said survey and core orientation data in
electronic form to a data capture means for later use.
[0036]      The controller may include means to capture or receive progress log of
drilling data.
[0037]      The controller may be arranged to transmit said progress log of drilling
data to the data capture means.
[0038]      The system may further include at least one telescopic rod extension
for direct or indirect connection to the survey probe or the core orientation
instrument. The telescopic rod extension may include at least one side wall
incorporating or predominantly formed of composite material.
[0039]       By including one or more adapters for attachment to an end or both
ends of the core orientation instrument or survey probe, said adapter(s) may vary
the effective diameter of the core orientation instrument or survey probe for
attachment to drill string extension components having a respective connecting
thread diameter greater than the diameter of a connecting thread of the core
orientation instrument or survey probe.
[0040]      A respective said adapter may be releasably attachable to the core
orientation instrument or to the survey probe. Multiple sizes, such as small
medium and large (relative to one another) diameter adapters may be provided.
A large diameter one of the adapters may be arranged to connect to a smaller
diameter said adapter, or said large diameter adapter is arranged to replace said
smaller or medium (intermediate size) diameter adapter.
[0041]      A survey system including multiple components may be arranged to be
housed in a portable container for transport and deployment at a drilling site, the
multiple components including a survey probe, a core orientation instrument and

                                            10
a single controller configured to control or communicate with the survey probe
and core orientation instrument.
[0042]      The system may further include a telescopic rod extension, thereby
alleviating the need for multiple extension rods of fixed length.
[0043]       Multiple sized adapter collars may be used in adapting the core
orientation instrument to threadingly engage with a selected extension barrel.
[0044]      A further aspect of the present invention provides a method of
collecting survey data from a drilling operation, the method including: providing a
survey system, the system including at least one survey probe, at least one core
orientation instrument and a common single controller, collecting data in the
controller from the survey probe and the core orientation instrument, and
transmitting said collected data to a data capture means.
[0045]      The method may include the controller communicating with at least
one survey probe, core orientation instrument or drilling operation remote from
the controller.
[0046]      Another aspect of the present invention provides at least one adaptor
for attachment to an end of a core orientation instrument or survey probe for use
in a survey system, the adaptor including attachment means to releasably attach
the adaptor, and thereby the core orientation instrument or survey probe, to at
least one drill string component.
[0047]      The core orientation instrument or survey probe can then be used in a
variety of (standard) drill-hole sizes at or greater than the size of the instrument or
probe without having to stock different size instruments creating unnecessary
duplication and additional space/weight. The adaptor(s) may be compatible to
LTK60, NQ, PQ, HQ and HQ2 drill strings and other drill string sizes commonly
used in the industry.

                                           11
[0048]       Preferably at least one said adaptor is provided for each of the two
ends of a core orientation instrument or survey probe. Thus, each end of the
instrument or probe can be adapted to connect to a selected same size or larger
size drill string component ahead of and behind the instrument or probe.
[0049]       The at least one adaptor may be releasably attached to the instrument
or probe, such as by one or more screw threads, retaining screws, bolts, clips or
pins. The adaptor may include a screw thread at one end thereof for releasable
engagement with an corresponding screw threaded end of the instrument or
probe, and another screw thread at the opposite end of the adaptor for
engagement with a corresponding screw thread of another adaptor or a drill string
component. Thus single or multiple adaptors may be used to convert the smaller
diameter instrument or probe to larger diameter drill string components.
[0050]       The adaptor may include at least one aperture through a side wall
thereof, which allows light from an optical instrument to pass to or from the core
orientation instrument or survey probe relative, or to allow lubrication fluid to flow
through the adaptor, to or from an exterior.
[0051]       A weld connection may be provided between the adaptor and the core
orientation instrument, the survey probe or the at least one drill string component
to prevent subsequent release of the adaptor.
[0052]       A second controller may be provided. This may be in the form of a
handheld device, optionally with reduced functionality compared with the common
controller, such as a master controller and slave controller arrangement. The
second controller may be configured to communicate with the common controller.
[0053]       A controller power pack may be provided to supply electrical power to
the second controller, and optionally a communication dock enabling data
communication between a portable memory device and the second controller
when the second controller is docked therewith may be provided. The dock may

                                          12
include a USB port for removable connection of a USB device, such as a memory
stick or 'thumb drive'.
[0054]      The common controller may be arranged and configured to capture
survey data or core orientation data, and to transmit said survey or core
orientation data in electronic form to a data capture means for later use.
[0055]      The second controller may also be arranged and configured to capture
survey data or core orientation data, and to transmit said survey or core
orientation data in electronic form to a data capture means for later use.
[0056]      The second controller may be arranged and configured to transmit
data to the common controller for assimilation or use with other data in the
common controller or for transmission to an external data capture device.
[0057]      The common controller may include means to capture or receive
progress log of drilling data. The common controller may also be arranged and
configured to transmit said progress log of drilling data to the data capture means.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
[0064]      A known system 10 will first be described with reference to Figure 1.
Figure 1 shows a comparison of currently required equipment to carry out
surveying, core orientation using three sizes for varying drill hole diameters in
deep hole drilling, and logging all events and activity at a drill-rig site.
[0065]       Extracting core samples during drilling
[0066]      As with the description of known systems and components in the
background section above, the common system 10 and method for core
extraction and orientation requires a process of dismantling at least two assembly
sections to complete the orientation. As every 3m or 6m requires core
orientation, a significant amount of time is spent during this process. For deep
hole drilling where at least three hole sizes are encountered, the equipment count
(and weight) for core orientation equipment almost trebles (as seen in Figure 1).
This occurs because a relatively wide borehole can first be drilled. As friction
increases with depth, a narrower hole is needed, and then again a third much
narrower drill. Thus, three different diameters of core orientation instruments 18,
20, 22 are required to match the three different drill widths. This significantly

                                            14
increases the number of components required in a known system. Matching
extension barrels (drill string extensions) are also required to connect the core
orientation instrument 18, 20, 22 to the drill string. Because there are three hole
sizes, there are three matching extension barrels 24. A core orientation
instrument controller 28 is used to control and communicate with the core
orientation instrument. This is in addition to a separate survey probe controller,
typically because these instruments may come from different manufacturers or
are supplied as stand alone sub systems.
[0067]      Surveying the drill hole at different depths
[0068]      The survey instrument/ probes 12 used in today's mining industry are
of an average length of 1m or more. They all require operation in a brass
pressure barrel 14 which needs to be disassembled from one end (at least) to
start the probe's operation and again to stop operation and extract data after
removal from a drill-hole. It is inherent for all magnetic survey instruments that an
average of 5m separation of its sensors from the drill bit and steel drill pipes is
required before making a valid reading. This is achieved using multiple solid
aluminium rod extensions 16. A survey instrument controller 26 is used to control
the survey instrument and obtain data from the instrument.
[0069]       Keeping a Progressive Log of Drilling
[0070]      As described above and shown in Figure 1, the industry norm is to use
handwritten forms and faxes 30 through to typing pools for data entry 32 and
eventual analysis/reporting of data and accounting 34. This long standing
method is plagued with human error and lost opportunity through inefficient
double and triple handling of data collection and recording drill-rig activity. Client
billing cycles are delayed and only sparse analysis (if at all) is available from the

[0071]      An embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figure 2. Such a
system requires fewer components than needed in a known system.
Replaceable adapters on the core orientation unit replace the various sizes of
core orientation units in known systems. This is a significant saving in equipment
costs and operational costs, as well as avoiding the need to transport the
additional electronic equipment to and from sites.
[0072]      Extracting core samples during drilling
[0073]      For extraction of core samples, the system 38 shown in Figure 2 uses
a single size (smallest diameter size) core orientation unit 18 with multiple size
adaptors 46, 48 to match with different stages of deep-hole drilling. This
beneficially avoids the need for multiple size core orientation instruments used in
the known systems.
[0074]      Drill string extensions 50, 52, 54 are utilised. Only one section needs
to be dismantled to remove the core sample as this core orientation unit has a
unique facility to communicate internal data without the need to remove the unit
from its back-end attachment.
[0075]      Surveying the drill hole at different depths
[0076]      A system of the present invention can utilise state-of-the-art SMT
(Surface Mount Technology) or wire bonding miniaturisation to achieve a survey
instrument probe 40 no longer than half a metre (500mm), be fully encased in its
own brass pressure housing, will not need dismantling for the start/stop/extract
data process, and achieves magnetic sensor separation using an
extendable/telescopic, preferably composite, material extension rod 42. The
probe 40 is designed to operate in harsh environments, and with thicker wall
pressure housing (due to internal electronic component miniaturisation), is easily
adaptable for deep-hole drilling.

[0077]       Keeping a Progressive Log of Drilling
[0078]       As seen in Figure 2, a system of the present invention integrates all
functions of an electronic controller 56 with core orientation and survey
instrumentation 40, 44, thereby only requiring a single controller rather than the
multiple controllers of the known art. The controller can provide seamless and
instant electronic data capture and communication for the drilling companies,
newly designed hardware and software functions will empower the driller to
operate from a central singular (hand-held) controller, with full access and
monitoring/validation of all instrument data, consumables, drilling target
progressive achievement and full analysis of work progress at the mine site.
[0079]       The single common controller for communicating with and controlling
the core orientation instrument/unit and also the probe(s) avoids the need for
multiple controllers. Furthermore, data capture by one controller allows different
data sets to be compared or used to derive further data. For example magnetic
field data from a probe can be combined with core orientation data to help
determine subsurface geological features or potential sites for deposits.
[0080]       Figure 3 shows a core orientation instrument 60 with a central body 62
for housing electronics, a first threaded end 76 and a second threaded end 78.
The first threaded end is arranged to receive an adaptor 64. This adaptor has an
external threaded portion 70 for connection to drill string component, such as a
greaser unit (not shown). This first adaptor 64 includes an internal thread 80
arranged to threadingly engage with the external first threaded end 76. After
screwing the adaptor 64 onto the first end of the core orientation instrument, a
circlip 68 is applied to retain the adaptor in place. The circlip engages into
grooves 72 through the wall of the adaptor. To prevent the adaptor from
unscrewing form the end of the core orientation instrument, the circlip will engage
against a shoulder of the end of the core orientation instrument. The circlip must
be removed before the adaptor can be unscrewed. At the other end of the core
orientation instrument, another external thread 78 is arranged to engage with an

                                           17
adaptor 66. This adaptor has spaced apertures 74 to allow light to transmit data
from the core orientation instrument to a light receiver or controller. This adaptor
can connect the core orientation instrument to a core barrel. It will be appreciated
that the adaptors can be used with other survey tools, such as survey probes.
[0081]      Figures 4a and 4b show an adaptor in cross section. Figure 4a shows
the adaptor before it is threaded onto the end of the core orientation instrument,
and Figure 4b shows the adaptor attached and the retaining circlip in place.
[0082]      Figures 5a to 5c show alternative arrangements for releasably
attaching the adaptor to the core orientation instrument. Figure 5a shows a circlip
type retainer, Figure 5b shows a multiple retaining screw (grub screw) alternative.
The retaining screws screw into threaded holes through the wall of the adaptor
and bite into the wall of the core orientation instrument or engage into holes in the
casing of the body. In Figure 5c, a screw threaded locking collar or sleeve 84
threads onto an external thread 82 of the adaptor. Tightening the collar or sleeve
clamps the adaptor to the core orientation instrument.
[0083]     The external threads 70, 78 of the adaptors can be sized to suit the
matching required size of the drill string components. Thus, instead of requiring
various sizes of core orientation instrument or other survey instrument, only one
smaller size of instrument is required and the end connections can be adapted by
use of the adaptors to suit a required size of corresponding drill string
components. This reduces the number of components required for a survey
system, reduces overall capital cost, avoids the need for multiple electronics
instruments, and makes the entire system portable in a transportable case.
[0084]      In use, the second controller may be used to capture data for one
surveying task, such as core orientation data, whilst the common controller
(considered a master or primary controller) is used for data on a second task,
such as handling a log of drilling or survey probe data. All data may be combined
by data transmission into one of the controllers, preferably the common controller.

                                           18
Data transmission may be infra red or wireless communication directly from one
controller to the next, or from on controller via a docking station to a memory
device and thence into the second controller. Alternatively, data from both
controllers may be transmitted to a remote device, such as a computer, for further
processing.
[0085]      The docking station may also act as a power charger for an on-board
battery in one or both controllers. An AC and/or car battery supply
adapter/transformer may be provided as part of the downhole survey system
equipment to aid with power and charging of the controllers. Data transmission
equipment may also be provided, such as a Wifi or satellite communication
enabled device to transmit data to a remote location or device.
[0086]      Figure 6 shows components of a downhole survey system 100
according to an embodiment of the present invention. The components are
housed in a container for safe transport to and from a drill site and for secure
storage. This prevents damage to the components and ensures all components
in the system are accounted for by providing a particular storage position for each
component. The components in the embodiment are shown housed in a
protective foam inlay 102 that sits inside the container (not shown). The
components include a downhole probe 104, and extension rod 106 (which may
be of a preselected length or may be telescopic) to connect the probe to a drill
string or other components. One or more downhole instruments, such as core
orientation units 108,110, can be included. The system further includes the option
to use adaptors 112,114,116,118 etc, to connect one or more of the instruments
and/or probes to a drill string. The adaptors are provided according to one or
more embodiments of the adaptor of the present invention. One or more of the
adaptors includes at least one aperture for entry/exit of light for communicating
data to or from an instrument or probe. The system further includes a hand held
electronic common controller 120 to receive, transmit and store data relating to a
drilling operation obtained by the probe or a core orientation unit. The controller is
termed a common controller because it operates with both the probe and at least

                                              19
one of the instruments. Such a controller can communicate with the probe and
one or more of the other instruments in the system to receive or send data or
instructions to operate the probe or instrument(s) or report on drilling activities,
such as a log of drilling. The controller includes a display screen. A second
controller 121 is also provide stored underneath the common controller. This
second controller can be a slave controller providing reduced functionality
compared to the common controller. The second controller can be used to
communicate with one of the probe or instrument while the common controller is
used to communicate with another of the probe or instrument, or to report on
drilling activities, such as a log of drilling. A charging device 122 is also provided.
This acts as a power source to charge an on-board respective battery for the
common controller and/or second controller. The charging device may provide
communication through wifi and/or satellite to a remote device or location. A
shock absorber device 124 is also provided to limit shocks through the probe and
instrument(s) when in use downhole. Tools, such as spanners 126 are also
provided, as well as a core orientation determining device 128.
