    A MULTI-SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATIONAL TOY BEAD
     FOR INFANTS AND A TOY PIECE OF JEWELRY COMPRISING A
                        PLURALITY OF SUCH TOY BEADS
 5     1. TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
           The present invention relates to a multi-skill development and educational
   toy bead dedicated to simultaneously improving dexterity, ability, capacity,
   creativity and concentration of young children.
       2. TECHNOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
10         A toy bead is a spherical or partly spherical pearl comprising an internal
   path adapted to receive a yarn so that a user can thread a plurality of beads on the
   yarn to form a bracelet, necklace, ring or similar piece of jewelry for kids.
           A toy bead is well known in the art and is mainly used as a recreational
   activity for kids to make piece of jewelry.
15         EP 3037577A1 discloses a beads connecting toy comprising a base for
   fabricating a beaded toy which is based on a strand set member which has a strand
   set locking portion formed at one end side and at the other end side thereof a
   beading strand on which beads are put, two base strands and an engaging strand
   which interweaves the beading strand, the two base strands and the beads together
20 for engagement, a one-end-side locking portion which is provided at one end side
   of the connecting toy main body and where the strand set locking portion is
   locked in place, and an other-end-side locking portion which is provided at the
   other end side of the connecting toy main body and where the two base strands
   and the beading strand are locked in place.
25         Such beads connecting toy enable children to make a bracelet with a
   certain degree of difficulty which is appropriate to teenagers. It is not suitable for
   young children and infants for which such beads connecting toy is too difficult to
   handle. In addition, once a piece of jewelry is built, the only way to create another

                                                2
   piece of jewelry is to undo totally the first piece of jewelry and to restart a second
    creation.
           US 6220010B1 discloses an ornamental chain made up of successive
    elements, in which at least one of said elements includes a hollow body inside
 5 which an insert is fixed that is designed to retain a link member that is linked to an
    adjacent element of the chain, said insert being constituted by at least one sleeve.
    The sleeve includes a slot that is wide enough to enable the shank of the link
    member to pass there through.
            Such ornamental chain enables a child to plug together successive beads
10 by use of link members arranged between beads. It is therefore possible to easily
   build up some bracelet or similar piece of kid jewelry and to undo such piece of
   jewelry without major difficulty. However, one drawback of this toy is that it uses
    small pieces of link members that can be lost which will make the toy useless. In
    addition, the creativity is limited to the succession of beads used and can become
15 boring after a couple of plays.
           The invention aims at overcoming at least some of the drawbacks of
   known toy beads.
        3. AIMS OF THE INVENTION

        4. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION
            The invention relates to a toy bead comprising:
15       two conjugated parts, each part comprising a proximal end and a distal end,
         proximal ends of said conjugated parts comprising conjugated screwing
            means adapted to screw conjugated parts to each other in order to build the
            bead,
         distal ends of said conjugated parts comprising plugging means, either male
20          or female, adapted to plug said parts respectively to parts of other toy
            beads comprising corresponding plugging means,
         each conjugated part further comprising an internal canal extending from its
            proximal end to its distal end and opening to each end, the internal canal of
            one part being collinear to the internal canal of the its conjugated part
25          when the conjugated parts are screwed to each other, so that a yarn can be
            threaded successively into internal canals of said conjugated parts.
            A toy bead according to the invention enables a child, in particular a young

                                              4
    child to simultaneously develop his capacity to lace, twist and plug. In addition, a
   toy bead according to the invention enables a kid to develop his creativity by
    offering the possibility to combine one part of a bead with another part of another
   bead to form a new and unique bead. In addition, beads can be linked to each
 5  other by the plugging means without the need of additional coupling elements. In
    addition, the invention enables a child to create a first piece of jewelry and to
    easily adapt or modify this creation without the need to undo totally the first piece
    of jewelry. A child can remove one bead from the piece of jewelry built by
   unplugging this bead from the two adjacent beads, and then change the
10  appearance of the removed bead, for example by unscrewing the two conjugated
   parts, to replace one or the two parts, to screw the new parts together, and to plug
   this new bead to the remaining chain of beads to build a modified piece of
   jewelry.
            Advantageously, the orientation and position of screwing means and
15 plugging means on the toy bead ensure two movements that are perpendicular to
    each other, a first movement of twisting to screw/unscrew the parts together
   which is performed in a twisting/untwisting plan (the plan of the proximal ends of
   the parts), and a linear movement to plug/unplug the bead from an adjacent bead,
   which is performed in a plan perpendicular to the twisting/untwisting plan. These
20  movements participate in the development of the ability of an infant.
            A toy according to the invention is progressive for an infant. In particular,
    at a very young age, the infant can only use the plugging functionality of the toy
   bead. When he grows up, he can further use the screwing and interchangeability
    functionality of the toy bead and/or the lacing functionality.
25          A toy bead according to the invention can present a first state, said built
    state, in which the two conjugated parts are screwed to each other, and a second
    state, said split state, in which the two conjugated parts are separated from each
    other. In the built state, the toy bead can be plugged into similar adjacent toy
   beads and further thread the beads together. In the split state, each part of the bead

                                              5
   can be assembled to another part of another bead to form a new bead.
        The form, dimension, aesthetical aspect of each conjugated part can be of
   different types. However, in a first embodiment, each conjugated part is
   hemispherical, the distal end being located on the top of the hemisphere and the
 5 proximal end being located at the base of the hemisphere.
        Hemispheric parts enable forming rounded beads, similar to pearls used for
   adults' pieces of jewelry. This said, in other embodiments, parts can be cubic or of
   any shape, for example a shape of a cartoon character or an animal.
        Advantageously and according to the invention, plugging means of each part
10 extend in the direction of the internal canal of this part.
        Such embodiment facilitates the insertion of a yarn once the beads are
   plugged to each other. In this embodiment, plugging means are hollowed and
   extend in the direction of the canal so that a yarn can be passed through the canal
   and through the plugging means.
15      Once the bead is built, namely once two conjugated parts are screwed
   together, the plugging means extend in the direction of the internal canals of said
   parts and this direction is perpendicular to the plan of the screwing means.
        Advantageously and according to the invention said plugging means of said
   conjugated parts are respectively male and female.
20      In this embodiment, plugging means of the conjugated parts of the bead
   comprise a male plugging mean and a female plugging mean shaped so that the
   male plugging mean can fit into the female plugging mean.
        Advantageously and according to the invention, the internal canal of each
   conjugated part comprises a proximal end shaped to receive the male plugging
25 mean of said conjugated parts.
        Such embodiment enables an infant to use parts of beads according to this
   embodiment as modules of a construction game. In particular, each conjugated
   part of any toy bead according to this embodiment can sit on a conjugated part of
   a toy bead according to this embodiment equipped with male plugging mean. In
30 other words, a conjugated part of a bead equipped with male plugging mean can
   form a base element (the proximal end of the conjugated part lying on a plane

                                             6
   surface) that supports the conjugated part by means of plugging the male plugging
   mean into the internal canal of the conjugated part which is shaped to receive the
   male plugging mean of the conjugated part of the bead.
        In other words, the proximal end of the internal canal forms, in this
 5 embodiment, a female plugging mean conjugated to the male plugging mean of
   the conjugated part. Therefore, conjugated parts of a bead according to this
   embodiment can either be assembled to each either by their respective screwing
   means, or be plugged to each other by fitting the male plugging mean of the
   conjugate part equipped with male plugging mean into the proximal end of the
10 internal canal of the conjugated part equipped with the female plugging mean.
        Advantageously and according to the invention, the toy bead further
   comprises a centrally hollowed intermediate part with two ends, each end
   comprising screwing means adapted to be screwed reciprocally to the screwing
   means of each conjugated part, so that the intermediate part can join the
15 conjugated parts together and extend in between the two parts when the bead is
   built.
        Such embodiment provides another functionality which is to create a 3-parts
   bead. The intermediate part is adapted to be screwed to each conjugated part. In
   other words, a bead according to this embodiment can either be formed by the two
20 conjugated parts screwed to each other, or be formed by the two conjugated parts
   and the intermediate part. Another advantage of this embodiment is that the
   intermediate part can present an external shape enabling to customize the bead. In
   one embodiment, the intermediate part is flat so that the general spherical shape of
   the bead is preserved. Therefore, the bead according to this embodiment presents
25 a general spherical shape with an intermediate radial disk extending in between
   the two conjugated parts.
        The intermediate part is centrally hollowed, which means that it comprises a
   central hole. This hole enables the passage of a yarn when the bead is built.
        The invention also concerns a toy piece of jewelry comprising a plurality of
30 toy beads, each toy bead comprising two conjugated parts, each part comprising a
   proximal end and a distal end,

                                             7
        proximal ends of said conjugated parts comprising conjugated screwing
           means adapted to screw conjugated parts to each other in order to build
           said bead,
        distal ends of said conjugated parts comprising plugging means, either male
 5         or female, adapted to plug said parts respectively to parts of another toy
           bead of the toy jewelry,
        each conjugated part further comprising an internal canal extending from its
           proximal end to its distal end and opening to each end, the internal canal of
           one part being collinear to the internal canal of the its conjugated part
10         when the conjugated parts are screwed to each other, so that a yarn can be
           threaded successively into internal canals of said conjugated parts.
           Advantageously and according to the invention, screwing means of each
   bead are identical so that each part of any bead can be combined to one part of
   any other bead of the toy piece of jewelry.
15         Advantageously and according to the invention said plugging means of
   each bead are identical so that each part of any bead can be plugged into one part
   of any other bead of the toy piece of jewelry.
           The invention can be opened using a screwing system to combine beads
   together. It provides several educational functionalities such as lacing, twisting
20 and plugging.
           The invention provides a plugging capacity as each bead has a male and/or
   female end that allows the beads to be connected together. The invention provides
   a lacing functionality as each bead has a path going through its body allowing the
   user to insert a thread through the bead. The invention also provides twisting
25 functionality as each bead contains two parts that can be open using a screwing
   system. The diameter of each bead is the same in order that half beads can be
   connected together and allows multiple combinations.

        6. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE
            INVENTION
            In the figures, scales and proportions are not strictly respected, for the
   purposes of illustration and clarity. Identical, similar or analogous elements are
 5 designated by the same reference signs in the different embodiments. Although
   the description refers to one or more embodiments, this does not necessarily mean
   that each reference relates to the same embodiment or that features apply only to
   one embodiment. Single features of various embodiments may also be combined
   in order to provide other embodiments.
10          Figures 1 and 2 represents a toy bead 10 according to a first embodiment
   of the invention in the built state. The toy bead 10 comprises two conjugated parts
    11, 12, said hereafter the upper part 11 and the lower part 12 of the toy bead 10.
   Each part presents a hollowed hemispherical shape. Such hollowed hemispherical
   shape defines an internal wall and an external wall. In particular, the lower part 12
15 comprises an internal wall 13 and an external wall 14. The external well 14 can
   present some specific design.
            The upper part 11 comprises a proximal end comprising screwing means
    11 a adapted to be screwed in conjugated screwing means 12a of the lower part 12.
            As shown on the figures 1 and 2, the screwing means 12a of the lower part
20  12 are formed in the internal wall 13 and the screwing means 11 a of the upper part
    11 are formed in an extension of the external wall of the upper part.
            The screwing means 1la, 12a of the two conjugated parts 11, 12 of the toy
   bead 10 can be combined together to link the two parts together.
            The man of the art will understand that the screwing means can be
25 arranged differently without changing the results achieved by the invention. In
   particular, the screwing means of the lower part can be formed in the extension of
   the external wall while the screwing means of the upper part can be formed in the
   internal wall of the upper part.

                                              10
            Figure 1 shows the toy bead built when the lower part 12 and the upper
   part 11 are screwed to each other by an action of twisting the parts respectively.
            Figure 1 also shows the internal canal 15 of the lower part 12. The upper
   part 11 of the toy bead comprises a similar internal canal so that, when the parts
 5  11, 12 are screwed to each other, the internal canal of the toy bead, formed by the
    internal canal of the upper part and the internal canal of the lower part, extends
    from the distal end of the lower part to the distal end of the upper part. A yarn 22
    can be introduced into the canal in order to form a piece of jewelry by combining
    several toy beads according to the invention as shown on Figure 6.
10          As shown on Figure 1, the toy bead further comprises plugging means 17,
    18, also said snapping means. In the embodiment shown on the Figures, plugging
    means 17 are male while plugging means 18 are female.
            Such plugging means 17, 18 enables an infant to connect beads together by
    slightly pressing both ends together. Therefore, the male plugging means 17
15  enters into the female plugging means 18 in order to connect two toy beads
   together, as shown on Figure 5.
            The yarn 22 can be introduced into the canal, either after beads are
   plugged to each other or before plugging beads to each other.
            Beads according to the invention can also be used to create a piece of
20 jewelry without the use of any yarn as the beads can be linked to each other by the
   plugging means.
            In other words, toy beads according to the invention are versatile and
   provide a wide range of usage for infants.
            Figure 3 represents a toy bead 100 according to a second embodiment of
25 the invention in the built state. The toy bead 100 comprises two conjugated parts
    110, 120, said hereafter the upper part 110 and the lower part 120 of the toy bead
    100. Each part presents a hollowed hemispherical shape.
            Screwing means of toy bead 100 are not visible on the Figure 3 as the toy

                                             11
   bead is in the built state. However, the plugging means 170, 180, respectively
   male plugging means 170 and female plugging means 180 are shown.
            Figure 4 shows the internal structure of the toy bead 100. In particular, it
   shows the internal canal 150 of the lower part 120 and the internal canal 160 of
 5 the upper part 110. It also shows the screwing means 110 a of the upper part 110
   screwed in the screwing means 120a of the lower part 120. As it is apparent on
   this Figure, when the upper part and the lower part are screwed to each other, the
   internal canal is formed and can receive a yarn to create a piece of jewelry by
   combining together several toy beads according to the invention, either according
10 to the first embodiment or to the second embodiment or to any other embodiment
   that will differ from the first or second embodiments essentially by the outside
   aspect of the parts.
            As it is also apparent from Figure 4, the internal canal 150 of the lower
   part 120 comprises a proximal end shaped to receive the male plugging mean 170
15 of the upper part 110. Therefore, it is possible to use the upper part 110 as a base
   (illustrated on Figure 10) and to plug the lower part 120 on top of the upper part
    110. In this new configuration, the said upper part 110 is actually the lower part,
   forming the base, and the said lower part is actually the upper part.
            As it is also apparent from Figure 4, the internal canal 160 of the upper
20 part 110 also comprises a proximal end shaped to receive the male plugging mean
   of the upper part of another bead.
            This embodiment enables to use the parts of the bead as modules of a
   construction game. This capability will be described in more details in relation to
   Figure 9 and 10.
25          Figure 7 shows the toy bead 10 according to the first embodiment and the
   toy bead 100 according to the second embodiment, respectively in the split state
   and in the built state. It also shows the interchangeability functionality of toy
   beads according to the invention. In particular, the upper part 110 can be screwed
   either to the lower part 120 or to the lower part 12 to form a mix toy bead. The

                                             12
   lower part 120 can be screwed either to the upper part 11 or to the upper part 110.
        Figure 8 shows a toy bead 200 according to another embodiment of the
   invention. It comprises two conjugated parts 210, 220, said hereafter the upper
   part 210 and the lower part 220 of the toy bead 200.
 5      The toy bead further comprises an intermediate part 215 with two ends, each
   end comprising screwing means adapted to be screwed reciprocally to the
   screwing means of each conjugated part.
        As shown on the right of the figure, once the bead 200 is built, the
   intermediate part 215 extends in between the upper part 210 and the lower part
10 220. The intermediate part 215 presents a general flat shape on Figure 8.
   However, the man of the art will understand that the intermediate part can be of
   any shape without modifying the object of the invention.
        Figures 9 and 10 illustrate the construction capabilities of toy beads according
   to embodiments in which the internal canal of each conjugated part comprises a
15 proximal end shaped to cooperate with the male plugging mean of said conjugated
   parts in order to use the different conjugated parts as construction elements.
   Therefore, beads according to this embodiment can form a meccano kit.
        In particular, the proximal end of the internal canal forms, in this
   embodiment, a female plugging mean conjugated to the male plugging mean of
20 the conjugated part. T
        As it can be seen on Figure 9, the construction comprises four different parts,
   the said lower part 220 of Figure 8 equipped with female plugging mean, the
   intermediate part 215 of Figure 8, the said upper part 11 of Figure 1 equipped
   with make plugging mean and a lower part 320 not yet represented equipped with
25 female plugging mean.
        The said lower part 220 is screwed with the intermediate part 215. The said
   upper part 11 is plugged into the internal canal of the said lower part 220. The
   said lower part 320 is then screwed to the upper part 11.
        The construction represented on Figure 10 comprises four different parts, the
30 said upper part 110 of Figure 1 equipped with male plugging mean, a lower part
   420 not yet represented equipped with female plugging mean, and the bead of

                                           13
   Figure 1 comprising said upper part 110 and said lower part 120 screwed to each
   other.
        Said upper part 11 forms the base of the construction of Figure 10. The lower
   part 420 equipped with female plugging mean is fitted on top of said upper part 11
 5 by plugging the male plugging mean of said upper part 11 into the internal canal
   of said lower part 420. Then, the bead according to Figure 1 is plugged into the
   female plugging mean of said lower part 420.
        As the man of the art will immediate perceived in view of the different
   examples, a multiple of different construction can be performed by the use of
10 beads according to the invention.
           The toy bead of the invention is not only limited to the embodiments
   describes. In particular, it is obvious that other shapes, dimensions, outside
   aspects of the toy bead can be used without changing the scope and results
   achieved by the invention.
