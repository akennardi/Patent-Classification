                 METHOD OF CLEANING RESIDUAL PESTICIDE FROM AN
                                     AGRICULTURAL VESSEL
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
         [0001] The present invention generally relates to methods of cleaning residual pesticide
from an agricultural vessel, and to kits and compositions useful for the practice of such methods.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
         [0002] Auxin herbicides, such as 2,4-D and dicamba, are highly effective for the control
of broadleaf weeds, particularly weeds that have become resistant to glyphosate. Dicamba, for
example, causes significant damage to plants even at extremely low application levels.
         [0003] When a pesticidal composition is sprayed, a residual amount of the active
pesticidal agent typically remains in the tank. This pesticidal residue, if left untreated, can pose
a significant problem for farmers by unintentionally damaging crops and desirable plants. As a
result, special precautions must be taken to prepare spray tanks for subsequent use following the
application of pesticides. This problem is particularly acute for auxin herbicides, such as
dicamba, where even small amounts of herbicidal residue could result in significant damage to
sensitive crop plants.
         [0004] Due to the high potency of dicamba, three full rinses of the spray tank are
traditionally required to ensure zero crop damage from the residue. Typical cleaning methods
require the cleaning rinse to stand in the spray tank for at least four hours, and preferably should
be allowed to soak overnight. This process, although effective, is both expensive and
cumbersome. The rinses require additional water in the field, and the long soaking period
reduces the time that the equipment is available for spraying crops.
         [0005] An alternative method of degrading pesticidal residue in the field, which reduces
the water use and time required for the farmer to switch to another pesticide, is therefore highly
desirable.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
         [0006] Briefly, therefore, the present invention is directed to methods of preparing a tank
for use in connection with a second pesticide following use of the tank in connection with a first
pesticide. In various embodiments, the first pesticide is an herbicide. The first and second
pesticides may be the same pesticide (e.g., dicamba). In various embodiments, the method
comprises introducing a cleaning mixture into a tank containing a residual amount of a first

    WO 2013/165905                                                           PCT/US2013/038660
                                                2
pesticide; the cleaning mixture comprises (a) a source of transition metal ions, and (b) a source
of hydrogen peroxide. Optionally, the cleaning solution may further comprise water. The
method further comprises allowing the cleaning mixture to remain in the tank for a time
sufficient to degrade at least a portion of the residual amount of the first pesticide, thereby
forming a waste mixture comprising degradation products of the first pesticide; and removing
the waste mixture from the tank.
        [0007] The present invention is further directed to kits for use in cleaning a tank
following the use of the tank in connection with a pesticide. Generally, the kits comprise a
source of hydrogen peroxide and a source of transition metal ions.
        [0008] In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the transition metal ions are
polyvalent iron ions.
        [0009] Other objects and features will be in part apparent and in part pointed out
hereinafter.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
        [0014] In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that the Fenton
reaction may be utilized to provide an economical and effective means of degrading residual
pesticides (e.g., herbicides) in agricultural vessels (e.g., spray tanks).
        [0015] In the Fenton reaction, in which a source of iron ions is utilized, ferrous iron ions
are oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radicals:
                 Fe2 + H2 02 -> Fe3 + OH- + OH-                  (1)

    WO 2013/165905                                                           PCT/US2013/038660
                                               3
         [0016] A second reaction, in which the iron (III) product compound is reduced in the
presence of hydrogen peroxide, makes the Fenton reaction catalytic with respect to iron:
                Fe3 + H2 02 -> Fe2 + H+ + HOO-                (2)
         [0017] In most environments, reaction (2) is several orders of magnitude slower than
reaction (1), and thus becomes the rate-limiting step where an excess of H2 0 2 is present.
         [0018] More generally, other transition metals have also been observed to catalyze
reactions similar to the Fenton reaction, wherein transition metal ions react with hydrogen
peroxide to produce hydroxyl radicals. For example, the transition metal may be selected from
the group consisting of copper, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese,
cobalt, nickel, cerium, ruthenium, aluminum, antimony, zinc, titanium, tin, barium, and
combinations thereof. Preferably, the transition metal ions are polyvalent. Cobalt is an example
of a transition metal known to engage in a Fenton-like reaction with hydrogen peroxide.
Accordingly, although the methods, compositions, and kits described herein are described
primarily with respect to the traditional Fenton reaction, which involves polyvalent iron ions as
the metal catalyst, one skilled in the art would understand that the present invention
encompasses the use of other transition metals as described above.
         [0019] When hydroxyl radicals are produced in the presence of a pesticide, the pesticide
is degraded into reaction products that do not retain pesticidal activity. Surprisingly, it has been
discovered that this reaction may be incorporated into an improved process for cleaning
pesticidal residue from spray tanks that provides a high level of effectiveness and requires
significantly less cleaning time than traditional rinses. The result is a convenient and
inexpensive solution that is beneficial for both farmers and custom applicators. In particular, the
methods of the present invention are suitable for in-field applications and also are more rapid
than conventional tank cleaning methods. For example, as detailed elsewhere herein, the
methods of the present invention are suitable for tank cleaning that occurs over a period of no
more than 30 minutes and, in various preferred embodiments, methods that occur over a shorter
period of time (e.g., less than about 10 minutes, or even less than about 5 minutes).
         [0020] Generally, the method involves the preparation of an aqueous cleaning mixture
comprising a source of transition metal ions (e.g., polyvalent iron ions) and a source of hydrogen
peroxide. The cleaning mixture is introduced into a tank containing a residual amount of the
pesticide, and is allowed to remain in the tank for a time sufficient to substantially degrade the

    WO 2013/165905                                                             PCT/US2013/038660
                                                4
pesticidal residue. As used herein, "degradation" refers to the process whereby the pesticide
decomposes into reaction products that do not retain pesticidal activity.
         [0021] Optionally, the present method may incorporate a pre-rinse step, wherein an
amount of an aqueous medium (e.g., water) is introduced into the tank prior to the cleaning step.
The pre-rinse step is useful to reduce any excessive pesticidal residue that may be present in the
tank, thereby decreasing the total amount of pesticide that remains to be degraded by the
cleaning solution. The waste product formed by the pre-rinse step, referred to herein as a diluted
pesticidal residue mixture, comprises a portion of the residual first pesticide. Typically, at least
a portion of the diluted pesticidal residue mixture is removed from the tank (e.g., by spraying)
prior to introduction of the cleaning mixture into the tank.
         [0022] Typically, the aqueous medium (e.g., rinse water) is introduced into the tank in a
volumetric ratio, with respect to the pesticidal residue at a typical pesticidal concentration, of at
least about 1:1, at least about 2:1, at least about 5:1, at least about 10:1, at least about 20:1, or at
least about 50:1.
         [0023] Generally, the amount of pesticide remaining in the tank and any appurtenant
apparatus (e.g., spray lines, pumps, etc.) can be reliably estimated by one skilled in the art based
on the size and shape of the tank, the spray apparatus, and the concentration of the first pesticide
mixture. In most cases, the amount of dead volume present in a spray tank, and in any
equipment connected thereto (e.g., a boom spray apparatus), will be known to the skilled worker
and/or the equipment manufacturer, and may be used to obtain a reasonably accurate estimate of
the amount of pesticidal residue remaining therein. Once the amount of pesticidal residue
remaining in the tank is estimated, appropriate amounts of the sources of transition metal ions
and hydrogen peroxide forming the cleaning mixture can be selected for introduction into the
tank. More particularly, appropriate molar ratios of hydrogen peroxide to pesticidal residue and
to the transition metal ions are disclosed below and can be used to determine appropriate
quantities of the sources of hydrogen peroxide and transition metal ions to form the cleaning
mixture.
         [0024] Where the spray tank is a component of a larger system, for example a boom
spray system, the cleaning mixture can also be used to clean the hoses, pumps, and spray nozzles
incorporated therein. Typically, water may be added to the cleaning mixture in an amount
sufficient to allow the cleaning mixture to recirculate through the system (e.g., the boom spray
system). The volume of liquid necessary for effective recirculation is dependent on the
particular equipment to be cleaned, and can be reliably determined by one skilled in the art.

    WO 2013/165905                                                         PCT/US2013/038660
                                               5
        [0025] Generally, the amount of water incorporated into the cleaning mixture will
correspond to the amount necessary to effectively recirculate the mixture through the system, as
described above. This water may be provided by the source of transition metal ions, source of
hydrogen peroxide, and/or as additional water added along with the source of transition metal
ions and source of hydrogen peroxide. Typically, water constitutes at least about 50%, at least
about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at
least about 98%, or at least about 99% by mass of the cleaning mixture.
        [0026] After the pesticidal residue has been degraded, a waste mixture comprising
degradation products of the first pesticide is formed, which should be removed from the tank.
Typically, the waste mixture is removed from the tank by spraying. Generally, a final water
rinse following the addition of the cleaning mixture is not required.
        [0027] A significant advantage of the present invention, as compared to the prior art, is
that the present methods may be performed in a relatively brief amount of time. More
particularly, it has been surprisingly discovered that Fenton-type chemistry is effective for
degradation of pesticidal residues over time scales such that tank cleaning methods
incorporating Fenton chemistry are dramatically shorter than the tank cleaning methods typically
employed in the prior art. For example, the duration between introduction of the cleaning
mixture into the tank and removal of the waste mixture from the tank is typically less than about
2 hours. Depending on the concentration of iron ions and hydrogen peroxide in the cleaning
mixture, and the amount of pesticidal residue in the tank, the duration may be less than about 1
hour, less than about 1 hour, less than about 30 minutes, less than about 25 minutes, less than
about 20 minutes, less than about 15 minutes, less than about 10 minutes, or even less than about
5 minutes.
        [0028] In most cases, at least about 50% by weight, at least about 60% by weight, at
least about 70% by weight, at least about 80% by weight, at least about 90% by weight, at least
about 95%, or at least about 99% by weight of the pesticidal residue is degraded prior to
removal of the waste mixture from the tank.
        [0029] In various embodiments, a pre-rinse step is not incorporated and the method
proceeds over a duration of no more than about 30 minutes. That is, the waste mixture is
removed from the tank (e.g., by spraying) within no more than about 30 minutes of introduction
of the cleaning mixture into the tank (e.g., within no more than about 15 minutes or no more
than about 5 minutes). Further in accordance with such embodiments, suitable degradation of

    WO 2013/165905                                                          PCT/US2013/038660
                                                6
the pesticidal residue (e.g., at least about 70% or at least about 80% by weight) is achieved
during such methods.
        [0030] The method may generally be used to degrade various pesticides known in the
art. Typically, the first pesticide comprises one or more first herbicides. Non-limiting examples

         [0032] Preferably, the present method is effective to degrade the residue of auxin
herbicides. Exemplary auxin herbicides include 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 4-(2,4
dichlorophenoxy)butanoic acid (2,4-DB), dichloroprop, (4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)acetic acid
(MCPA), 4-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)butanoic acid (MCPB), mecoprop, dicamba, picloram,
quinclorac, agriculturally acceptable salts or esters of any of these herbicides, and mixtures
thereof.
         [0033] The present method is particularly effective for the degradation of dicamba and
2,4-D. Without being bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the dominant
degradation pathway utilized by the present method involves an attack on the ether linkages
present in the dicamba and 2,4-D molecules. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
analysis involving dicamba as described in the working examples herein shows a decrease in the
dicamba molecule concentration followed by a corresponding increase in the concentration of
2,4-dichlorosalicylate as a degradation product. In certain embodiments, in addition to dicamba
or 2,4-D, the present method is also effective for the degradation of flumioxazin.
         [0034] The polyvalent iron ions may be derived from any water-soluble compound
comprising iron in a +2 or +3 oxidation state. Suitable compounds include ferric ammonium
sulfate, ferric chloride, ferric oxide, ferric oxide hydrate, ferric sulfate, ferrous ammonium
sulfate, ferrous oxide, ferrous chloride, ferrous sulfate and/or iron salts of di-, tri- or other
polycarboxylic acids such as iron citrate. Ferrous sulfate, ferric chloride and iron citrate are
preferred sources of iron ions for use with the present method.
         [0035] Ferrous sulfate is a particularly preferred source of iron ions. Ferrous sulfate
dissolves readily in water, and has been found to exhibit favorable reaction kinetics as compared
to other sources of polyvalent iron. Additionally, ferrous sulfate does not cause damage to most
plastics or stainless steel, materials which are commonly used in pesticidal tanks.

         [0036] The concentration of transition metal ions in the source of transition metal ions is
typically at least about 5 grams per liter (g/L), at least about 7.5 g/L, at least about 10 g/L, at
least about 12.5 g/L, at least about 15 g/L, at least about 17.5 g/L, at least about 20 g/L, or at
least about 25 g/L.
         [0037] Aqueous hydrogen peroxide is readily available from commercial suppliers, and
is a preferred reagent for use with the present method. Alternatively, the method may utilize one
or more compounds that react or dissociate to produce hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous
environment. Exemplary reagents of this type include sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate,
and other sources of peroxides, such as adducts of urea and peroxide.
         [0038] Typically, hydrogen peroxide is incorporated into the cleaning mixture in a
concentration of at least about 100 grams per liter of cleaning mixture. To reduce cleaning time
and increase the rate of pesticidal degradation, a higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide may
be incorporated into the cleaning mixture. Typically, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in
the source of hydrogen peroxide is at least about 125 g/L, at least about 150 g/L, at least about
175 g/L, at least about 200 g/L, at least about 225 g/L, or at least about 250 g/L.
         [0039] In cases where it is possible to accurately estimate the amount of pesticidal
residue remaining in the tank, the amount of hydrogen peroxide added to the cleaning mixture
may be adjusted accordingly. Typically, the molar ratio of hydrogen peroxide to residual
pesticide is at least about 10:1, at least about 25:1, at least about 50:1, at least about 75:1, at least
about 100:1, at least about 125:1, or at least about 150:1. Generally, higher hydrogen peroxide
to pesticide ratios provide for faster degradation of the pesticidal residue.
         [0040] In certain embodiments, the molar ratio of hydrogen peroxide to residual
pesticide (e.g., first pesticide) is from about 10:1 to about 60:1, from about 10:1 to about 50:1, or
from about 10:1 to about 40:1. In other embodiments, the molar ratio of hydrogen peroxide to
residual pesticide (e.g., first pesticide) is from about 15:1 to about 35:1, from about 20:1 to
about 35:1, or from about 25:1 to about 35:1. In still other embodiments, the molar ratio of
hydrogen peroxide to residual pesticide (e.g., first pesticide) is from about 10:1 to about 30:1, or
from about 10:1 to about 20:1.
         [0041] Generally, the relative amounts of the hydrogen peroxide source and the
transition metal source are incorporated into the cleaning mixture such that the initial molar ratio
of hydrogen peroxide to transition metal ions is from about 500:1 to about 1:1. More typically,
the initial molar ratio of hydrogen peroxide to transition metal ions is at least about 5:1, at least
about 8:1, at least about 10:1, at least about 12:1, at least about 15:1, at least about 20:1, at least

    WO 2013/165905                                                             PCT/US2013/038660

about 25:1, or at least about 50:1 with hydrogen peroxide being in molar excess. As used
herein, the term "initial molar ratio" at least refers to the molar ratio of the hydrogen peroxide to
transition metal ions at the outset of the cleaning operation (e.g., when the sources of hydrogen
peroxide and transition metal ions are combined prior to initiation of the Fenton reaction). This
does not, however, exclude the possibility that such molar ratios may persist during the cleaning
operation. Typically, the source of hydrogen peroxide will be added to the cleaning mixture in a
mass ratio of at least about 0.5:1, at least about 1:1, at least about 2:1, at least about 5:1, or at
least about 10:1 as compared to the source of transition metal ions.
         [0042] Additional considerations may apply when the pesticidal residue comprises a
species that chelates or otherwise binds with free metal ions in solution. For example, many
phosphate-containing herbicides (e.g., glufosinate) are known to be effective chelators. A
particularly notable example of a species known to chelate free metal ions is N
(phosphonomethyl)glycine, commonly referred to as glyphosate.
         [0043] Glyphosate is a highly effective and commercially important broad spectrum
herbicide useful in controlling the growth of germinating seeds, emerging seedlings, maturing
and established woody and herbaceous vegetation, and aquatic plants. Glyphosate is used as a
post-emergent herbicide to control the growth of a wide variety of annual and perennial grass
and broadleaf weed species in cultivated crop lands, including cotton production, and is the
active ingredient in the ROUNDUP family of herbicides available from Monsanto Company
(Saint Louis, MO).
         [0044] In addition to its herbicidal properties, glyphosate, by virtue of the presence of
carboxyl and a phosphonomethyl groups or ligands, can function as a strong complexing agent
and can chelate or otherwise bind with free metal ions in solution. In particular, glyphosate has
been observed to chelate or bind with polyvalent iron ions, which are preferred for use with the
methods described herein. As a consequence, the present methods require more metal ions to be
added to the cleaning mixture when glyphosate is present in the herbicidal residue to
compensate for this effect.
         [0045] Frequently, herbicidal glyphosate formulations also contain relatively low
concentrations of N-(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid (PMIDA) and/or salts thereof which
are intermediate compounds produced during the glyphosate manufacturing process. Like
glyphosate, PMIDA also chelates or binds with metal ions, and therefore also contributes to the
requirement of additional transition metal ions added to the cleaning mixture.

    WO 2013/165905                                                           PCT/US2013/038660
                                               10
         [0046] For example, it has been observed that when no metal chelation is present (i.e., in
the absence of glyphosate), suitable degradation of dicamba residue may occur with very low
amounts of metal catalyst in the cleaning mixture (e.g., < 1 mM). In the presence of glyphosate,
however, herbicidal degradation was only observed with cleaning mixtures having transition
metal ion concentrations that provided at least a 1:1 molar ratio of polyvalent iron ions to
glyphosate, acid equivalent (a.e.).
         [0047] Accordingly, when glyphosate is present, the molar ratio of transition metal ions
to glyphosate is preferably greater than 1:1. Typically, the ratio is at least about 2:1, at least
about 3:1, or at least about 4:1. In certain embodiments, the molar ratio of transition metal ions
to glyphosate is from about 1:1 to about 8:1, from about 1:1 to about 6:1, or from about 2:1 to
about 4:1.
         [0048] Generally, the methods of the present invention do not require the use of a pH
adjusting agent. Aqueous solutions of iron (II), typically derived from a source such as ferrous
sulfate, have been found to be effective without adjustment of pH.
         [0049] The use of a pH adjusting agent may be desirable, however, when aqueous
solutions of iron (III) are employed. At a pH of up to about 2, ferric iron has a strong tendency
to hydrolyze to form a binuclear species, [Fe(H 20) 4(OH) 2Fe(H 20) 4] 4* and at a pH above about 2
to 3 polynuclear Fe-OH species. The latter results in the precipitation of colloidal or hydrous
ferric oxide.
         [0050] The cleaning mixture preferably has a pH of from about 2 to about 4. Sodium
hydroxide is typically used to raise the pH, if necessary, while a lower pH is typically achieved
through addition of the acidic counterion corresponding to the iron source (e.g., H 2 SO 4 when
ferrous sulfate is used, or HCl when ferric chloride is used). Glyphosate salts, if present in the
herbicidal residue, typically act to buffer the system to a pH of approximately 4.
         [0051] As shown in Equation 1, reproduced below, the Fenton reaction involves the
oxidation of ferrous iron ions by hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radicals:
                Fe2 + H2 02 -> Fe3 + OH- + OH-                (1)
         [0052] This reaction requires stoichiometric amounts of Fe2 + and hydrogen peroxide to
produce an equivalent molar quantity of hydroxyl radicals. The Fenton reaction is catalytic,
however, to the extent that the iron (III) product compound is reduced in the presence of
hydrogen peroxide:

    WO 2013/165905                                                           PCT/US2013/038660

                  Fe3 + H2 02 -> Fe2 + H+ + HOO-               (2)
         [0053] In the conventional Fenton process, reaction (2) is several orders of magnitude
slower than reaction (1), and thus becomes the rate-limiting step in environments where an
excess of H2 0 2 is present. Alternative pathways for reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II), however, are
known in the art, and are predominantly used in many applications of Fenton chemistry for
water or soil treatment.
         [0054] For example, an alternative version of reaction (2) uses photochemical energy,
rather than ambient thermal energy, to reduce the Fe(III) species to Fe(II):
                  Fe  + H2 0 2 ->hv  Fe2 + H+ + HOO-                   (2B)
         [0055] In this reaction, the Fe(OH)2 + ion absorbs light at wavelengths up to about 410
nm, which falls in the near-UV region of the spectrum. The photochemical reduction process
including the combined process of reactions (1) and (2B) is generally known as the photo
assisted Fenton (or photo-Fenton) reaction.
         [0056] Advantageously, the present method has been shown to work without the
requirement of UV lighting or other photons to assist the reaction. This is beneficial, in part,
because the UV lighting and other equipment required to carry out the photo-Fenton reaction can
be fragile, unwieldy, and expensive, particularly when the reaction is scaled up to the level
required for the agricultural uses described herein. Experiments were conducted using foil
wrapped containers, wherein the present method was used to degrade herbicidal residue in the
absence of UV light. The foil-wrapped container results showed no significant differences in
reaction kinetics as compared to equivalent experiments conducted in the presence of UV light.
As a result, the present method does not require the cleaning mixture to be subjected to an
artificial light source while in the tank. The tank material may be substantially opaque to
ultraviolet light. In addition, the present method is suitable for use in large-scale agricultural
operations.
         [0057] As a further alternative to the UV-induced catalysis described above, an applied
electric current may be used to reduce the iron (III) species, thereby regenerating the iron ions in
solution. Advantageously, the present method does not require the use of electrochemistry, in

    WO 2013/165905                                                           PCT/US2013/038660

in the tank.
Kits
         [0058] The present invention is further directed to kits for use in connection with the
methods described herein.
         [0059] Generally, the kit comprises a source of polyvalent iron ions and a source of
hydrogen peroxide. The sources of polyvalent iron ions and hydrogen peroxide, respectively,
may be selected as described above. The kit may further comprise instructions for carrying out
the methods described herein.
         [0060] Typically, the source of hydrogen peroxide and the source of polyvalent iron ions
should be packaged separately, such that they do not interact prior to the formation of the
cleaning solution.
         [0061] Following are Examples presented to illustrate the present invention and are not
intended to limit the scope of this invention. The examples will permit better understanding of
the invention and perception of its advantages and certain variations of execution.
EXAMPLES
Example 1
         [0062] An experiment was conducted to measure the reaction kinetics of the present
method with respect to dicamba. Ferric chloride (FeCl 3) was used as the source of iron.
Aqueous hydrogen peroxide (30% w/w) was used as the peroxide source.
         [0063] An additional sample was prepared with glyphosate to measure the effect of iron
chelation on the dicamba degradation process.
         [0064] Hydrogen peroxide was added to the reaction vessel in a molar ratio of 100:1
with respect to dicamba. In the absence of glyphosate, the results show that the dicamba
concentration was degraded to below detectable limits in 24 hours. In the sample containing
glyphosate, however, the reaction was effectively stopped due to chelation of the iron species.
The results of these trials are summarized in Table 1 below.

varying peroxide levels on the degradation reaction kinetics. Aqueous hydrogen peroxide,
sodium percarbonate, and OXICLEAN were each used at 100:1 and 10:1 molar ratios with
respect to dicamba, in samples both with and without the presence of glyphosate. Control
samples were also prepared with one or more herbicides in the absence of a source of hydrogen
peroxide, a source of iron, or both.

dicamba remaining in the reaction mixture. The pH of the reaction mixture was also recorded.

Example 3
        [0068] An experiment was conducted to investigate whether the chelation effect of
glyphosate can be overwhelmed by including additional amounts of iron. Samples were
prepared using ferric chloride (FeCl 3) and ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4 ), respectively, which were
incorporated at molar ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 with respect to glyphosate.
        [0069] Aqueous hydrogen peroxide (30% w/w) was used as the peroxide source, and
was provided in a 100:1 molar ratio with respect to dicamba. A small number of control
samples, as shown in the table below, were prepared in the absence of a peroxide source.
        [0070] For samples comprising both glyphosate and dicamba, the herbicides were
present in a molar ratio of 1.5:1, respectively.
        [0071] The results showed that at both 1:1 and 2:1 molar ratios of iron salt to glyphosate,
the dicamba was fully degraded after 24 hours, with the concentration being either not detectable
(ND) or detectable but not quantifiable (< 5 ppm) (DBNQ).

        [0073] Experiments were conducted using a dicamba / glyphosate tank mix formulation.
        [0074] The herbicidal formulation was diluted to a concentration of 0.6% (g/g), which is
appropriate for commercial spray applications. Further dilutions were made from this stock
solution. Ferric chloride hexahydrate was provided by FISHER and diluted to a 10% (g/g)
solution on an anhydrous basis with distilled water. Aqueous hydrogen peroxide (30%) was
provided by SIGMA-ALDRICH and was used as received.

          [0075] Experiments were performed in the hood using 8 drachm (~30 ml) glass vials.
Reagents were added to the vials in the following order: dicamba solution, ferric chloride
solution, and aqueous hydrogen peroxide. One milliliter samples were taken from each vial at
5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minute intervals and placed into HPLC vials containing a 10% solution of
N-(phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid (PMIDA) . The PMIDA quenched the reaction by
rapidly chelating iron and preventing it from degrading peroxide. The amount of PMIDA
solution in each vial was calculated such that the sum of the moles of glyphosate and PMIDA
were a 10% excess of the moles of iron present.
          [0076] Samples were analyzed using ion chromatography coupled with mass
spectroscopy (IC/MS/MS) to determine the dicamba concentration with time. Results were
reported on a mass basis in parts-per-million (ppm) of the sample.

Example 5
        [0078] Using data generated in connection with the experiments described in Example 4,
reaction kinetics were calculated for degradation of dicamba in the presence of glyphosate. The
results are generally consistent with first order kinetics for all of the reagents.
        [0079] For example, Fig. 1 shows the expected concentration of dicamba with respect to
time on a logarithmic scale. The reaction rate constant (represented by the slope of the line) is
not significantly impacted by the initial dicamba concentration, implying first-order behavior.
Fig. 2 depicts the reaction rate constant as a function of initial hydrogen peroxide concentration.
Generally, the data indicate that hydrogen peroxide has a first order effect on reaction rate. Fig.
3 depicts the reaction rate constant as a function of the iron to glyphosate molar ratio. Note that
approximately 1.56 molar equivalents of iron are required to start the reaction in the presence of
glyphosate. Also noteworthy is that the impact of increasing iron concentration is
approximately 10 times greater than that achieved by increasing the concentration of hydrogen
peroxide.
        [0080] The reaction rate can reasonably be described by the equation below
                d [D]
                 a-t =4F-Fj[P[D](1)
Where D is the dicamba concentration in ppm, F is the molar ratio of total iron to glyphosate,
and P is the peroxide concentration. From the kinetic data, k = 7.2 x 10-7 min-' and F0 = 1.56
mol iron / mol glyphosate. The rate equation is able to accurately fit the observations made in
Examples 1-4 regarding changing peroxide and dicamba concentrations.

Example 6
         [0081] The Fenton method, which was applied to degrade dicamba in Examples 1-4, was
applied to 2,4-D to investigate whether this herbicide could also be degraded. The solutions set
forth in Table 8, below, were prepared and placed in separate glass vials. The solutions were
then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography at 12 days following the first mixing.
As shown in the table below, no dicamba or 2,4-D was detected in any of the samples
comprising Fenton reagents.

Example 8
        [0088] This example describes a small-scale demonstration of the efficacy of the present
invention in largely eliminating injury to soy due to residual levels of three herbicides: dicamba,
2,4-D and flumioxazin, all in the presence of glyphosate. Four simulated spray solutions were
prepared. All of the solutions were prepared assuming a 10 gallon/acre spray rate with a
glyphosate rate of 1.0 lb acid equivalent (a.e.) per acre (1120 g/ha). The source of the
glyphosate was Roundup Powermax@ herbicide. In addition, the spray solutions contained
dicamba diglycolamine salt (Clarity@) or 2,4-D amine sometimes in combination with
flumioxazin derived from Valor herbicide.
        [0089] 60 ml of the simulated spray solutions were transferred to 250 ml beakers. A
ferrous sulfate solution (10% iron) was added to each solution in an amount that provided 3
moles of iron per mole of glyphosate. 30 moles of hydrogen peroxide per mole of dicamba or

15 or 30 moles of hydrogen peroxide per mole of 2,4-D was then added. The flask was swirled
and allowed to stand for 20 minutes. Oxygen evolution occurred with mild foaming.
        [0090] Immediately after 20 minutes had elapsed, the treated solutions were diluted 30x
and sprayed over glyphosate-tolerant soybeans at a 10 gallon per acre rate. As a control,
untreated solution, was diluted 30x and sprayed at the same rate. Soybean injury was rated 7
days after spraying. Injury to soy was dramatically reduced in all cases.
