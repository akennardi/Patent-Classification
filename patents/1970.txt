Field of the Invention
[0003] The field of the invention is electrochemistry. The devices and systems described
involve the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into useful products, the
electrolysis of water, fuel cells and electrochemical water purification.

                                               2
Background of the Invention
[0004] There is a desire to decrease carbon dioxide (C0 2) emissions from industrial facilities
and power plants as a way of reducing global warming and protecting the environment. One
solution, known as carbon sequestration, involves the capture and storage of CO2. Often the
C02 is simply buried. It would be beneficial if instead of simply burying or storing the C02,
it could be converted into another product and put to a beneficial use.
[0005] Over the years, a number of electrochemical processes have been suggested for the
conversion of C02 into useful products. Some of these processes and their related catalysts
are discussed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,959,094; 4,240,882; 4,349,464; 4,523,981 ; 4,545,872;

[0006]     Processes utilizing electrochemical cells for chemical conversions
have been known for years. Generally an electrochemical cell contains an
anode, a cathode and an electrolyte. Catalysts can be placed on the anode, the
cathode, and/or in the electrolyte to promote the desired chemical reactions.
During operation, reactants or a solution containing reactants are fed into the
cell. Voltage is then applied between the anode and the cathode, to promote the
desired electrochemical reaction.
[0007]     When an electrochemical cell is used as a CO 2 conversion system, a
reactant comprising C0 2 , carbonate or bicarbonate is fed into the cell. A voltage
is applied to the cell, and the CO 2 reacts to form new chemical compounds.
[0008]     Several different cell designs have been used for CO 2 conversion.
Most of the early work used liquid electrolytes between the anode and cathode
while later scientific papers discussed using solid electrolytes.
[0009]     U.S. Patent Nos. 4,523,981; 4,545,872; and 4,620,906 disclose the use
of a solid polymer electrolyte membrane, typically a cation exchange
membrane, wherein the anode and cathode are separated by the cation exchange
membrane. More recent examples of this technique include U.S. Patent Nos.
7,704,369; 8,277,631; 8,313,634; 8,313,800; 8,357,270; 8,414,758; 8,500,987;

and 8,696,883. In these patents, a liquid electrolyte is used in contact with a
cathode.

                                         -4
[0010]     Prakash, G., et al. "Electrochemical reduction of CO 2 over Sn-Nafion
coated electrode for a fuel-cell-like device", JournalofPower Sources 223
(2013), pages 68-73 ("PRAKASH"), discusses the advantages of using a liquid
free cathode in a cation exchange membrane style CO 2 electrolyzer although it
fails to teach a liquid free cathode. Instead, a liquid solution is fed into the
cathode in the experiments discussed in PRAKASH.
[0011]     In a liquid free cathode electrolyzer no bulk liquids are in direct
contact with the cathode during electrolysis, however there can be a thin liquid
film on or in the cathode. In addition the occasional wash or rehydration of the
cathode with liquids may occur. Advantages of using a liquid free cathode
included better CO 2 mass transfer and reduced parasitic resistance.
[0012]     Dewolf, D., et al. "The electrochemical reduction of CO 2 to CH 4 and
C2 H4 at Cu/Nafion electrodes (solid polymer electrolyte structures)" Catalysis
Letters 1 (1988), pages 73-80 ("DEWOLF"), discloses the use of a liquid free
cathode in a cation exchange membrane electrolyzer: an electrolyzer with a
cation-conducting polymer electrolyte membrane separating the anode from the
cathode. DEWOLF reports an observed maximum faradaic efficiency (the
fraction of the electrons applied to the cell that participate in reactions
producing carbon containing products) of 19% for CO 2 conversion into useful
products and a small steady state current of 1 mA/cm 2.
[0013]     Various attempts have been made to develop a dry cell to be used in a
CO 2 conversion system, as indicated in Table 1 below. However, a system in
which the faradaic efficiency in a constant voltage experiment is greater than
32% has not been achieved. Furthermore, the reported rates of CO 2 conversion
current (calculated as the product of the faradaic efficiency for CO 2 conversion
and the current in the cell after 30 minutes of operation) have been less than 5

                                          -5
mA/cm 2: too small for practical uses.
[0014]     There are a few reports that claim higher conversion efficiencies. In
particular, Shironita, S., et al., "Feasibility investigation of methanol generation
by C02 reduction using Pt/C-based membrane electrode assembly for a
reversible fuel cell", J. Power Sources 228 (2013), pages 68-74 ("SHIRONITA
I"), and Shironita, S., et al., "Methanol generation by C02 reduction at a Pt
Ru/C electrocatalyst using a membrane electrode assembly", J. Power Sources
240 (2013), pages 404-4 10 ("SHIRONITA II"), reported "coulombic
efficiencies" up to 70 %. However columbic efficiency is different from
faradaic efficiency. A system can have a high coulombic efficiency for the
production of species adsorbed on the electrocatalyst, but may only observe a
small faradaic efficiency (0.03% in SHIRONITA I and SHIRONITA II) for
products that leave the catalyst layer. This phenomena is adequately explained
in Rosen, B.A., et al., "In Situ Spectroscopic Examination of a Low
Overpotential Pathway for Carbon Dioxide Conversion to Carbon Monoxide",
J. Phys. Chem. C, 116 (2012), pages 15307-15312, which found that when CO 2
is reduced to adsorbed CO during CO 2 conversion by cyclic voltammetry, most
of the CO does not leave the electrolyzer.
[0015]    Recently, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2012/0171583
(the '583 publication) disclosed a cation exchange membrane design that could
be run with a liquid free cathode. The application states that a "system may
provide selectivity of methanol as part of the organic product mixture, with a
30% to 95% faradaic yield for carbon dioxide to methanol, with the remainder
evolving hydrogen." However, the application does not provide data
demonstrating a 30% to 95% faradaic yield. Furthermore, in trying to repeat the
experiment, a steady state faradaic efficiency near zero during room temperature

                                         -6
electrolysis was observed. These results are further laid out in Comparison
Example 1 below.
 [0016]    In conclusion, faradaic efficiencies of less than 30% are not practical.
What is needed is a process that has a faradaic efficiency of at least 50%,
preferably over 80%. Furthermore, a device with a low CO 2 conversion current
is impractical. What is needed is a device with a CO 2 conversion current of at
least 25 mA/cm 2.
Summary of the Invention
 [0017]    The low faradaic efficiencies and conversion currents seen in current
CO 2 electrolyzers with liquid free cathodes can be overcome by an anion
exchange membrane electrolyzer with an anode and cathode separated by a
Helper Membrane. Helper Membranes can increase the faradaic efficiency of
the cell. They can also allow product formation at lower voltages than without
the Helper Membrane.
 [0018]    Helper Membranes are related to the Helper Catalysts described in
earlier U.S. Patent Applications Serial Nos. 12/830,338 and 13/174,365,
International Patent Application No. PCT/US2011/042809, and U.S. Patent No.
8,956,990. Helper Membranes like the disclosed Helper Catalysts increase the
faradaic efficiency and allow significant currents to be produced at lower
voltages.
 [0019]    In at least some embodiments the Helper Membrane can include an
imidazolium, pyridinium, or phosphonium ligand.
 [0020]    A membrane can be classified as a Helper Membrane if it meets the
  following test:

                          -7
1. A cathode is prepared as follows:
   a.    A silver ink is made by mixing 30 mg of silver
         nanoparticles (20-40 nm, stock # 45509, Alfa Aesar,
         Ward Hill, MA) with 0.1 ml demonized water (18.2
         Mohm, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and 0.2 ml
         isopropanol (stock # 3032-16, Macron Fine Chemicals,
         Avantor Performance Materials, Center Valley, PA). The
         mixture is then sonicated for 1 minute.
   b.    The silver nanoparticle ink is hand painted onto a gas
         diffusion layer (Sigracet 35 BC GDL, Ion Power Inc.,
         New Castle, DE) covering an area of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm.
2. An anode is prepared as follows:
   a.    RuO2 ink is made by mixing 15 mg of RuO2 (stock #
         11804, Alfa Aesar) with 0.2 ml demonized water (18.2
         Mohm Millipore), 0.2 ml isopropanol (stock # 3032-16,
         Macron) and 0.1 ml of 5% Nafion solution (1 100EW,
         DuPont, Wilmington, DE)
   b.    The RuO2 ink is hand-painted onto a gas diffusion layer
         (Sigracet 35 BC GDL, Ion Power) covering an area of 2.5
         cm x 2.5 cm.
3. A 50-300 micrometer thick membrane of a "test" material is
   made by conventional means such as casting or extrusion.
4. The membrane is sandwiched between the anode and the
   cathode with the silver and ruthenium oxide catalysts facing the
   membrane.
5. The whole assembly is mounted in Fuel Cell Technologies
   (Albuquerque, NM) 5 cm2 fuel cell hardware with serpentine

                  flow fields.
           6.     CO 2 humidified at 50'C is fed into the cathode at a rate of 5
                  seem with the cell at room temperature and pressure, the anode
                  side is left open to the atmosphere at room temperature and
                  pressure, 3.0 V is applied to the cell, and the cathode output
                  composition is analyzed after the cell has been running for 30
                  minutes at room temperature.
           7.     Selectivity is calculated as follows:
                 Selectivity   =            (CO Productionrate)
                                 (CO production rate+H 2 productionrate)
where the CO and H 2 production rates are measured in standard cubic
centimeters per minute (sccm) leaving the electrolyzer.
[0021]    If Selectivity is greater than 50%, and the CO 2 conversion current at
3.0 V is 20 mA/cm 2 or more, the membrane containing the material is a Helper
Membrane, for which:
          (CO 2 conversion current)     =  (Total cell current) * (Selectivity)
[0022]    An electrochemical device for converting CO 2 to a reaction product
includes an anode, a cathode, and an anion-conducting polymer electrolyte
membrane interposed between the anode and the cathode, wherein at least a
portion, if not the entire of polymer electrolyte membrane, is a Helper
Membrane. In some embodiments the membrane is essentially immiscible in
water.

device comprising a Helper Membrane, the faradic efficiency is at least 50%. In
some embodiments the Helper Membrane comprises a polymer containing at
least one of an imidazolium ligand, a pyridinium ligand, and a phosphonium
ligand.
[0025]    In some embodiments, the device also contains a Catalytically Active
Element such as Au, Ag, Cu, Sn, Sb, Bi, or In.
[0026]    In some embodiments the membranes are between 25 and 1000
micrometers thick.
[0027]     In some embodiments, the membranes contain reinforcing polymers
such polybenzimidazole (PBI), poly(p-phenylene oxide) (PPO), polyamide
(Nylon), polyethylene (PE), or related reinforcing polymers.

Specific Description
[0051]     Generally an electrochemical cell contains anode 50, cathode 51 and
electrolyte 53 as indicated in FIG. 1. A membrane 52 can also be included in the
cell. Catalysts may be placed on anode 50, and/or cathode 51, and/or in
electrolyte 53 to promote the desired chemical reactions. During operation,
reactants or a solution containing reactants is fed into the cell. Then a voltage is
applied between the anode and the cathode, to promote an electrochemical
reaction.
[0052]     Alternately, when the device is used as a fuel cell, reactants or a
solution containing reactants is fed into the cell, and a voltage spontaneously
develops between the anode and cathode. This voltage can produce a current
through an external circuit connecting the anode and cathode.
[0053]     When an electrochemical cell is used as a CO 2 conversion system, a
reactant comprising C0 2 , carbonate or bicarbonate is fed into the cell. A voltage
is applied to the cell, and the CO 2 reacts to form new chemical compounds.
[0054]     The present electrochemical device for the electrochemical conversion
of C0 2 , water, carbonate, and/or bicarbonate into another chemical substance
has an anode, a cathode, and a Helper Membrane.
[0055]     In some embodiments there are no, or substantially no, bulk liquids in
contact with the cathode during cell operation, and the faradaic efficiency for
CO 2 conversion is at least 33%, more preferably at least 50%, or most
preferably at least 80%.

                                        - 15
[0056]     The device can also include at least one Catalytically Active Element.
"Catalytically Active Element" as used here refers to a chemical element that
can serve as a catalyst for the electrochemical conversion of CO 2 or another
species of interest in a desired reaction. In particular, the device can include one
or more of the following Catalytically Active Elements: V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,
Cu, Sn, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg, Al, Si,
In, Tl, Pb, Bi, Sb, Te, U, Sm, Tb, La, Ce, and Nd. Research has established that
Pt, Pd, Au, Ag, Cu, Ni, Fe, Sn, Bi, Co, In, Ru and Rh work well with Au, Ag,
Cu, Sn, Sb, Bi, and In working especially well. The products of the reaction can
include, among other things: CO, HCO-, H2 CO, (HC02)-, H 2 CO 2 , CH 30H, CH 4 ,
C2 H4 , CH 3 CH 2OH, CH 3COO-, CH 3COOH, C2 H6 , (COOH) 2 , (COO-) 2 ,
H 2 C=CHCOOH, CF 3COOH, other organic acids, carbonates, di-phenyl
carbonate, and polycarbonates.
[0057]     Without further elaboration, it is believed that persons familiar with
the technology involved here using the preceding description can utilize the
invention to the fullest extent. The following examples are illustrative only, and
are not meant to be an exhaustive list of all possible embodiments, applications
or modifications of the invention.
Specific Example 1
[0058]     Specific Example 1 illustrates a procedure to create an electrolyzer
with a Helper Membrane. The embodiment of Specific Example 1 demonstrates
improved performance over earlier electrochemical cells used for CO 2
conversion.
[0059]     Measurements were conducted in an electrolysis cell with an anode,
cathode, and anion-conducting polymer electrolyte membrane held in Fuel Cell
Technologies 5 cm 2 fuel cell hardware with serpentine flow fields.

                                        - 16
[0060]    The cathode in Specific Example 1 was prepared as follows. Silver ink
was made by mixing 30 mg of silver nanoparticles (20-40 nm, 45509, Alfa
Aesar, Ward Hill, MA) with 0.1 ml demonized water (18.2 Mohm, EMD
Millipore, Billerica, MA) and 0.2 ml isopropanol (3032-16, Macron Fine
Chemicals, Avantor Performance Materials, Center Valley, PA). The mixture
was then sonicated for 1 minute. The silver ink was then hand-painted onto a
gas diffusion layer (Sigracet 35 BC GDL, Ion Power Inc., New Castle, DE)
covering an area of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm.
[0061]    The anode in Specific Example 1 was prepared as follows. RuO2 ink
was made by mixing 15 mg of RuO2 (11804, Alfa Aesar) with 0.2 ml demonized
water (18.2 Mohm Millipore), 0.2 ml isopropanol (3032-16, Macron) and 0.1 ml
of 5% Nafion solution (11 OOEW, DuPont, Wilmington, DE). The RuO2 ink was
then hand-painted onto a gas diffusion layer (Sigracet 35 BC GDL, Ion Power,
Inc.) covering an area of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm.
[0062]    The PSMMIM membrane was prepared following the synthetic route
in FIG. 2. "PSMMIM" refers to a co-polymer of polystyrene and poly 1-(p
vinylbenzyl)-3-methyl-imidazolium:
where X- is an anion and m > 0 and n > 0.
[0063]    The first inhibitor free styrene was prepared by washing styrene
(Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) with two equal volumes of 7.5% aqueous

                                        - 17
sodium hydroxide. The inhibitor free styrene was then washed with four equal
volumes of water to make sure it was neutralized, and was then dried over
anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Inhibitor TBC in 4-vinylbenzyl chloride (4
VBC) was removed by extraction with 0.5% potassium hydroxide solution until
a colorless extract was obtained. This extract was washed with water until
neutral and then was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
[0064]     Poly(4-vinylbenzyl chloride-co-styrene) was then synthesized by
heating a solution of inhibitor free styrene (Sigma-Aldrich) (10.0581 g, 96.57
mmol) and 4-vinylbenzyl chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) (6.2323 g, 40.84 mmol) in
chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich) (15 ml) at 60-65'C in an oil bath for 12-18
hours under argon gas with AIBN (a,a'-Azoisobutyronitrile, Sigma-Aldrich)
(0.1613 g, 0.99 wt% based on the total monomers weight) as initiator. The
copolymer was precipitated in CH 30H/THF (methanol/tetrahydrofuran) and
dried under vacuum.
[0065]     Polystyrene methyl-methyimidazolium chloride (PSMMIM 2.3:1) was
synthesized by adding 1-methylimidazole (Sigma-Aldrich) (2.8650 g, 0.0349
mol) to the solution of the poly(4-VBC-co-St) (5.0034g) in anhydrous NN
Dimethylformamide (DMF) (Sigma-Aldrich) (30 mL). The mixture was then
stirred at room temperature for 0.5-1 hour, and then heated at 110-120'C for
50.3 hours to form a PSMMIM 2.3:1 solution.
[0066]     "4-VBC-co-St" or "poly(4-vinylbenzyl chloride-co- styrene)" as used
here refers to a co-polymer of styrene and 4-vinylbenzyl chloride:

                                        - 18
[0067]     The membranes were prepared by casting the PSMMIM solution
prepared above directly onto a flat glass surface. The thickness of the solution
on the glass was controlled by a film applicator (MTI Corporation, Richmond,
CA) with an adjustable doctor blade. The membranes were then dried in a
vacuum oven at 80'C for 300 minutes, and then 120'C for 200 minutes.
Chloride ion in the membranes was removed by soaking the membranes in 1 M
KOH solution for 24 hours.
[0068]     The resultant membrane was tested and determined to meet the
classification as a Helper Membrane according to the test set forth in the
Summary of the Invention section of the present application. The membrane
was sandwiched between the anode and the cathode with the metal layers on the
anode and cathode facing the membrane, and the whole assembly was mounted
in a Fuel Cell Technologies 5 cm 2 fuel cell with serpentine flow fields.
[0069]     CO 2 humidified at 50 0 C was fed into the cathode at a rate of 5 sccm,
the cell was operated at atmospheric pressure with the anode inlet and outlet left
open to the atmosphere, 3.0 V were applied to the cell, and the cathode output
composition was analyzed with an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (GC)/TCD
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with a Carboxen 1010 PLOT
GC column (30 m x 320 um) (Sigma Aldrich). No heating was applied to the
cell.
[0070]     Initially the cell produced 100 mA/cm 2 , but the current dropped and

                                         - 19
held steady at 80 mA/cm 2 after a few minutes of operation. GC analysis after 30
minutes of operation showed that the output of the cell contained C0 2 , CO and a
small amount of hydrogen. Selectivity was calculated at 94% where:
                 Selectivity  =          (CO Productionrate)
                                (CO production rate+H 2 productionrate)
[0071]     Therefore PSMMIM is properly classified as a Helper Membrane.
[0072]     In a second trial, water was fed into the anode of the cell to keep the
PSMMIM hydrated. In that case the membrane was able to maintain over 90%
selectivity for 200 hours.
[0073]     During both runs the leakage current was checked and was negligible.
Furthermore there were no other products on the cathode. As such, the faradaic
efficiency was equal to the Selectivity.
Comparative Example 1
[0074]     Comparative Example 1 measured the steady state current and
faradaic efficiency of an electrolyzer constructed following the teachings of the
'583 publication, which claimed to disclose a system that "may provide
selectivity of methanol as part of the organic product mixture, with a 30% to
95% faradaic yield for carbon dioxide to methanol, with the remainder evolving
hydrogen." However the '583 publication fails to provide data demonstrating a
30% to 95% faradaic yield when the cathode is liquid free. In Comparative
Example 1 a cell was built following the teachings in the '583 publication and
the faradaic efficiency was measured at room temperature with a liquid free
cathode.
[0075]     Following the teachings in the '583 publication, the cathode was
prepared as follows. First a platinum nanoparticle ink was made by mixing 10

                                        - 20
mg of platinum black (12755, Alfa Aesar) with 0.2 ml demonized water (18.2
Mohm Millipore) and 0.2 ml isopropanol (3032-16, Macron). The mixture was
then sonicated for 1 minute. The platinum nanoparticle ink was then hand
painted onto a gas diffusion layer (Sigracet 35 BC GDL, Ion Power) covering
an area of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm.
[0076]     The platinum catalyst layer was then coated with a thin layer of poly
(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP, average MW: ~60,000, Sigma Aldrich) by brushing
0.2 ml of 1% P4VP ethanol solution. Then the platinum catalyst layer was
immersed in 1 M H 2 SO 4 solution (A300C-212, Fisher Chemical, Pittsburgh,
PA) to protonate pyridine.
[0077]     The anode was prepared as in Specific Example 1. Specifically, RuO2
ink was made by mixing 15 mg of RuO2 (11804, Alfa Aesar) with 0.2 ml
demonized water (18.2 Mohm Millipore), 0.2 ml isopropanol (3032-16, Macron)
and 0.1 ml of 5% Nafion solution (1 100EW, DuPont). The RuO2 ink was then
hand-painted onto a gas diffusion layer (Sigracet 35 BC GDL, Ion Power)
covering an area of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm.
[0078]     Next a proton exchange membrane (Nafion 117, DuPont) was
sandwiched between the anode and cathode with the metal coatings facing the
membrane, and the whole assembly was mounted in Fuel Cell Technologies 5
cm 2 fuel cell hardware with serpentine flow fields.
[0079]     The cell was tested using the procedures in Specific Example 1.
Specifically CO 2 humidified at 50 0 C was fed into the cathode at a rate of 5
sccm, the cell was at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, the anode
inlet and outlet were left open to the atmosphere, 3.0 V were applied to the cell,
and the cathode output composition was analyzed with an Agilent 6890 gas

                                        - 21
chromatograph (GC)/TCD equipped with a Carboxen 1010 PLOT GC column
(30 m x 320 um). No heating was applied to the cell.
[0080]     The total cell current was found to be 80 mA/cm 2 but no methanol or
other CO 2 reduction products could be detected. Instead hydrogen was the only
product detected by GC. There was no evidence for methanol condensation in
the tubing. Based on the measurements, the selectivity and faradaic efficiency of
a cell constructed following the teachings of the '583 publication with a liquid
free cathode is near zero. The CO 2 current is also near zero at room temperature.
[0081]     Note that the GC results show that the methanol concentration in the
gas phase is negligible, and methanol cannot condense at room temperature
until the partial pressure of methanol in the gas phase reaches about 13 kPa,
where 13 kPa is the vapor pressure of methanol at room temperature.
[0082]     SHIRONITA I also was unable to detect CO 2 reduction products in a
similar experiment, but was able to detect products when heating the cell to
90'C. However in any case the faradaic efficiency was still low.
[0083]     Table 1 lists the observed faradaic efficiencies and CO 2 conversion
currents at room temperature for various membranes and catalyst(s)
combinations for various cells disclosed in prior research as well as the results
from Specific Example 1 and Comparative Example 1. The faradaic efficiencies
were calculated after 1 hour in a steady state, constant voltage experiment. In
some cases higher efficiencies are reported by cycling the potential. As can be
seen, the use of the Helper Membrane raised the faradaic efficiency by roughly
a factor of 3 and the product current by a factor of 16.

Comparative Example 2
[0084]     Comparative Example 2 was conducted to determine whether Nafion,
sulfonated Poly(Ether Ether Ketone) "SPEEK", polyvinyl alcohol (PVA),
polyethylenimine (PEI), CMI-7000, AMI 7001, phosphoric acid doped PBI or
Neosepta membranes act as Helper Membranes when pretreated as described in
the earlier literature as described in Table 1.
[0085]     Nafion 117 was purchased from Ion Power Technologies, Inc., of
Wilmington, DE. It was boiled in 5% H2 0 2 for 1 hour and it was then boiled in
Millipore water for 1 hour. The Nafion 117 was then boiled in 0.5 M sulfuric
acid for an hour, and then boiled again in Millipore water for 1 hour.
[0086]     Neosepta BP-1E was purchased from Ameridia Division of Eurodia
Industrie S.A. in Somerset, NJ. It was pretreated by dipping it in water as
recommended by the manufacturer. It was then tested to determine whether it
met the classification as a Helper Membrane according to the test set forth in the
Summary of the Invention section of the present application. The selectivity was
34%, below the 50% require to be classified as a Helper Membrane.
[0087]     CMI-7000 and AMI-7001 were purchased from Membranes
International Inc. of Ringwood, NJ. An alkali doped AMI-7001 was prepared
following the procedure outlined in Aeshala, L., et al., "Effect of cationic and

                                         - 24
anionic solid polymer electrolyte on direct electrochemical reduction of gaseous
CO 2 to fuel", Journalof CO 2 Utilization 3 (2013), pages 49-55 ("AESHALA
I"). First the AMI-7001 was soaked in a 0.5 molar potassium hydroxide (KOH)
solution overnight to create basic sites in the membrane. Excess KOH was then
washed off by soaking the membrane in water for 6 hours. The membrane was
then tested to determine whether it met the classification as a Helper Membrane
according to the test set forth in the Summary of the Invention section of the
present application. Both the selectivity (25%) and product current (2.5
mA/cm 2 ) were low, as reported in Table 2 below, indicating that an alkali doped
AMI-7001 membrane as pretreated according to AESHALA I is not a Helper
Membrane.
 [0088]     Similarly, the acid doped CMI-7000 was pretreated following the
procedure outlined in AESHALA I. First the membrane was soaked in 0.5 M
H2 SO 4 overnight, then it was soaked in water for 6 hours. The membrane was
then tested to determine whether it met the classification as a Helper Membrane
according to the test set forth in the Summary of the Invention section of the
present application. GC analysis showed only traces of CO formation,
indicating that this membrane is not a Helper Membrane.
 [0089]     Alkali doped PVA was synthesized following the procedure outlined
in Aeshala, L., et al., "Effect of solid polymer electrolyte on electrochemical
reduction of C0 2 ", Separation and Purification Technology 94 (2012), pages
 131-137 ("AESHALA II"). PVA (stock #36308 1) was purchased from Sigma
Aldrich Corporation. 9 grams of PVA were dissolved in 90 ml of water at 90'C.
The solution was cast onto a petri dish. After the cast films had dried, they were
immersed in glutaraldehyde (10% in acetone solutions) mixed with small
quantities of catalytic HCl for one hour to encourage cross-linking. The films

                                        - 25
were then rinsed several times with Millipore water, activated by immersion in
0.5 M NaOH for 24 hours, and then rinsed before use. The membrane was then
tested to determine whether it met the classification as a Helper Membrane
according to the test set forth in the Summary of the Invention section of the
present application. While the selectivity (52%) was relatively high, the product
current (7.5 mA/cm 2 ) was low, as reported in Table 2 below, indicating that an
alkali doped PVA membrane as pretreated according to AESHALA II is not a
Helper Membrane.
[0090]     An alkali doped PVA/PEI composite was synthesized following the
procedure outlined in Aeshala, L., et al., "Electrochemical conversion of CO 2 to
fuels: tuning of the reaction zone using suitable functional groups in a solid
polymer electrolyte", Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 16 (2014), pages 17588-17594
(AESHALA III). A PEI (item number 408727) was purchased from Sigma
Aldrich Corporation. 6 grams of PVA and 3 grams of PEI were dissolved in 90
ml of water at 90'C. The solution was cast onto a petri dish. After the cast films
had dried, they were immersed in glutaraldehyde (10% in acetone solutions)
mixed with small quantities of catalytic HCl for one hour to encourage cross
linking. The films were then rinsed several times with Millipore water. They
were then activated by immersion in 0.5 M NaOH for 24 hours and then rinsed
before use.
[0091]     The membrane was then tested to determine whether it met the
classification as a Helper Membrane according to the test set forth in the
Summary of the Invention section of the present application. Both the
selectivity (16%) and the product current (1.6 mA/cm 2 ) were low, as reported in
Table 2 below, indicating that an alkali doped PEI/PVA membrane as pretreated
according to AESHALA III is not a Helper Membrane.

                                       - 26
 [0092]    SPEEK was prepared following the procedure in the procedure
outlined in AESHALA II. A PEEK film was purchased from CS Hyde
Company (Lake Villa, IL). 1 g of the PEEK was exposed to 50 ml of
concentrated sulfuric acid for 50 hours under constant agitation. All of the
PEEK had dissolved at the end of the 50 hours and had converted to SPEEK.
200 ml of Millipore water was placed in an ice bath and allowed to cool to near
00 C. The SPEEK solution was then slowly poured into the Millipore water
under constant agitation. The SPEEK precipitated out of the water solution, was
filtered, and was then washed multiple times to remove excess sulfuric acid.
The SPEEK was then dried at 100'C for 8 hours in a vacuum oven. Next the
SPEEK was dissolved in dimethylacetamide. The resultant solution was cast on
a glass slide. The membrane was then tested to determine whether it met the
classification as a Helper Membrane according to the test set forth in the
Summary of the Invention section of the present application. Both the
selectivity (2.5%) and the product current (0.13 mA/cm 2 ) were low, as reported
in Table 2 below, indicating that a SPEEK membrane as pretreated according to
AESHALA II is not a Helper Membrane.
 [0093]    Phosphoric Acid doped PBI was prepared as follows. PBI was
purchased from PBI Performance Products, Inc. (Rock Hill, SC) and acid doped
by immersing it in 0.5 M H3 PO 4 for 24 hours. It was then soaked in water for 1
hour to remove excess acid. The membrane was then tested to determine
whether it met the classification as a Helper Membrane according to the test set
forth in the Summary of the Invention section of the present application. Again
the current and selectivity were low.
 [0094]    Notice that Nafion, SPEEK, alkali doped PVA, alkali doped PVA/PEI,
Acid doped CMI-7000, Alkali doped AMI-7001 Neosepta, and P-PBI are not

                                            - 27
Helper Membranes.
Specific Example 2
 [0095]    The object of this example was to determine whether changes in the
membrane doping could activate a membrane for CO 2 conversion. AMI-7001
and CMI-7000 were chosen as test examples since they have the same
polystyrene backbone as in PSMMIM and PSDMIM, but different amine
groups, so they might be able to be activated.
 [0096]    The AMI-7001 was pretreated by soaking the membrane in a 1 M
NaCl solution for one hour, followed by soaking in water for about 3 hours.
 [0097]    The selectivity rose to 70%. The current density was still low (3.5
mA/cm 2 ). So this membrane is still not a Helper Membrane but its performance
is much better.
 [0098]    The CMI-7000 was pretreated using the same procedure. Again, the
selectivity rose to 72%. The current density was still low (15 mA/cm 2 ).
 [0099]    Still, it is likely that the current could be raised if thinner membranes
were made with the same bulk composition as AMI-7001 and CMI-7000, and
then the membranes were doped with NaCl. Such a membrane could be a
Helper Membrane.
Specific Example 3
 [0100]    The objective of Specific Example 3 is to provide another example of
a Helper Membrane.
 [0101]    Preparation of PSDMIM: Poly(4-vinylbenzyl chloride-co-styrene) was
prepared as in Specific Example 2. 1,2-dimethylimiazole (Sigma-Aldrich)
(2.8455 g, 0.0296 mol) is added to the solution of the poly(4-VBC-co-St)

                                        - 28
(5.0907 g) in anhydrous N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (Sigma-Aldrich) (30
mL). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 0.5-1 hour, and then
heated at 110-120'C for 66.92 hours. PSDMIM was obtained as a yellowish
solid after purification by precipitation into diethyl ether.
[0102]     A PSDMIM membrane was formed as in Specific Example 2. Then
the membrane was tested as in Specific Example 1. The results are given in
Table 2 below. PSDMIM refers to a co-polymer of styrene and 1-(p
vinylbenzyl)-2,3-dimethyl-imidazolium:
where X- is a anion and m > 0 and n > 0.
Specific Example 4
[0103]     The objective of Specific Example 4 is to provide an example of a
Helper Membrane with a pyridinium group.
[0104]     Preparation of PSMP: poly(4-vinylbenzyl chloride-co-styrene) was
prepared as in Specific Example 2. Pyridine (Sigma-Aldrich) is added to the
solution of the poly(4-VBC-co-St) (5.0907 g) in anhydrous N,N
Dimethylformamide (DMF) (Sigma-Aldrich) (30 mL). The mixture was stirred
at room temperature for 0.5 - 1 hour, and then heated at 110-120'C for 66.92
hours. PSMP was obtained as a brownish solid after purification by
precipitation into diethyl ether. PSMP refers to a material that contains a co-

                                         -  29
polymer of styrene and 1-(p-vinylbenzyl)-pyridinium.
[0105]      A PSMP membrane was formed as in Specific Example 2. The
resultant membrane did not have a uniform thickness, but the membrane was
still suitable to test. The film was tested as in Specific Example 1 and qualified
as a Helper Membrane.
[0106]      Table 2 shows the faradaic efficacies and currents observed for the
Helper Membranes disclosed in this application along with those of the
membranes discussed in earlier studies. In all cases the membranes were tested
and determined to meet the classification as a Helper Membrane according to
the test set forth in the Summary of the Invention section of the present
application.

Specific Example 5
[0107]     The objective of this example was to examine the effects of the
fraction of the amine in the polymer on the performance. The Helper Membrane
was made from methylimidazolium-poly(4-vinylbenzylchloride-co-styrene)
chloride (PSMIM-Cl) polymer solution of various compositions.
[0108]     PSMIM-Cl solution (in anhydrous dimethylformamide) was prepared
by a two-step reaction process: (1) Poly(4-VBC-co-St) synthesis from the
reaction of styrene (St) with 4-vinylbenzyl chloride (4-VBC) in chlorobenzene
under argon gas (S.J. Smith, Urbana, IL) protection with 2,2'-Azobis(2
methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) as initiator. (2) Poly(4-VBC-co-St) was reacted
with 1-methylimidazole at 50-120'C for more than 48 hours to obtained
PSMIM-Cl polymer solution.
[0109]     Synthesis of poly(4-vinylbenzyl chloride-co-styrene): A solution of
inhibitor free styrene (Sigma-Aldrich) (10.0581 g, 96.57 mmol) and 4
vinylbenzyl chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) (6.2323 g, 40.84 mmol) in chlorobenzene
(Sigma-Aldrich) (15 ml) was heated at 60-65'C in an oil bath for 12-18 hours
under argon gas with AIBN (Sigma-Aldrich) (0.1613 g, 0.99 wt% based on the
total monomers weight) as initiator. The copolymer was precipitated in CH 30H/
THF and dried under vacuum. VBC content in the copolymer was 38.26 wt%.
[0110]     Synthesis of methylimidazolium-poly(4-VBC-co-St) chloride (MIM
poly(4-VBC-co-St)-Cl): 1-methylimiazole (Sigma-Aldrich) (2.8650 g, 0.0349

                                        -31
mol) was added to the solution of the poly(4-VBC-co-St) (5.0034 g) in
anhydrous NN-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (Sigma-Aldrich) (30 ml). The
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 0.5-1 hour, and then heated at 110
 120'C for 50.3 hours.
 [0111]   Membranes preparation: The membrane preparation steps were: (1)
Cast PSMIM-Cl polymer solution prepared above onto a flat glass (8 cm x 10
cm) with a 0.1 to 1 ml pipette. (2) Put the glass plate with membranes in an
oven (MTI Corporation); the membranes were then dried at 80'C for 4 hours
and then 120'C for another 2 hours under the protection of nitrogen. (3) After
the oven temperature cooled down to room temperature, the membranes were
taken out and soaked in a 1 M KOH (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) bath.
Membranes were peeled off from the substrates and soaked in 1 M KOH
solution for at least 24 hours for complete anion exchange (Cl- -* OH-) before
testing.
 [0112]   The synthesis procedure for the PSMIM-Cl polymer solution with
VBC content of 38.26 wt% and the membrane fabrication procedure were used
for the synthesis of PSMIM-Cl with VBC compositions of 46 wt% and 59 wt%
respectively. The testing results of these membranes are summarized in Table 3
below. Membrane current density increases with increasing functional group
VBC content in the copolymer, while mechanical strength of membranes get
worse. The membrane with 59 wt% VBC is very soft and its mechanical
strength is very weak.

[0113]     Fitting the data to an exponential curve, and extrapolating to lower
VBC content shows that the current will be above 20 mA/cm2 whenever there is
at least 15% VBC in the polymer. This corresponds to a styrene to (p
vinylbenzyl)-3-methyl-imidazolium ratio of no more than 7.
Specific Example 6
[0114]     The objective of this example is to provide examples of reinforced
helper membranes. In particular, Helper Membranes will be provided made
from blends of methylimidazolium-poly(4-vinylbenzylchloride-co- styrene)
chloride (PSMIM-Cl) and polymer matrix such as polybenzimidazole (PBI),
poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,2-phenylene oxide) (PPO), Nylon 6/6, or polyethylene
(PE).
[0115]     PSMIM-Cl solution (in anhydrous dimethylformamide) was prepared
by a two-step reaction process: (1) poly(4-VBC-co-St) was synthesized from the
reaction of styrene (St) with 4-vinylbenzyl chloride (4-VBC) in chlorobenzene
under argon gas (S.J. Smith) protection with 2,2'-Azobis(2-methylpropionitrile)
(AIBN) as initiator; 2) poly(4-VBC-co-St) was reacted with imidazole at 50
120'C for more than 48 hours to obtained PSMIM-Cl solution.
[0116]     PBI polymer solution was prepared by diluting 27.5264 g of about

                                       - 33
26.6 wt% PBI solution (PBI Performance Products. Inc., Charlotte, NC) with
anhydrous dimethylacetamide (DMAc) (Sigma Aldrich) to 78.3578 g. The
concentration of the resulting PBI solution was 9.34 wt%.
[0117]    Nylon 6/6 solution was prepared by adding 4.6065 g of Nylon 6/6
(Sigma Aldrich) into 24.3218 g of about 97% formic acid (Acros Organics,
Geel, Belgium) and 2.5625 g anhydrous methanol (Avantor Performance
Materials Inc.) mixture. Nylon pellets were allowed to dissolve for several
hours at room temperature, then in a Branson 2510 sonication bath (Sonics
Online, Richmond, VA) until a homogeneous white emulsion was obtained. The
concentration of the resulting Nylon solution is 14.83 wt%.
[0118]     10.2 wt% PPO solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5099 g of PPO
(Sigma Aldrich) in 5 mL chlorobenzene (Fisher Scientific).
[0119]     15 wt% PE solution was prepared by dissolving 4.5 g of PE (Sigma
Aldrich) in 30 ml xylenes (Fisher Scientific). PE completely dissolved in
xylenes at 70-80'C.
[0120]    Preparation procedure of Helper Membrane #4 from blends of
PSMIM-Cl and PBI: (1) Add 0.1 ml PBI polymer solution into 4 ml PSMIM-Cl
solution (VBC content in the copolymer was 46 wt%) and light brown
precipitate was immediately formed. The solid in the polymer solution was
dispersed by ultra-sonication with an ultrasonic probe (tip diameter 3 mm)
(Sonic & Materials. Inc., Newtown, CT) until a homogeneous brown emulsion
was obtained. (2) Cast the resulting polymer solution on a glass plate (8 cm x 10
cm) with a 0.1 to 1 ml pipette. (3) Put the glass plate with membranes in an
oven (MTI Corporation); the membranes were then dried at 80'C for 4 hours
and then 120'C for another 3 hours under the protection of nitrogen. (4) After

                                       - 34
oven temperature cooled down to room temperature, take the membranes out
and soaked in a IM KOH (Fisher Scientific) bath, membranes were peeled off
from the substrates and soaked in 1 M KOH solution for at least 24 hours for
complete anion exchange (Cl- -* OH-) before testing.
 [0121]   The obtained light brown PSMIM-Cl and PBI blend membranes were
transparent and homogeneous with very good mechanical strength.
 [0122]   The PSMIM-Cl and PBI blend membrane #4 preparation procedure
was used for the preparation of PSMIM-Cl and PBI blend membranes #5, 6 and
7. The ratio of PSMIM-Cl solution to PBI solution was varied, as shown in
Table 4 below.
 [0123]   The membranes were tested and determined to meet the classification
as a Helper Membrane according to the test set forth in the Summary of the
Invention section of the present application. The testing results are summarized

dispersed by ultra-sonication with an ultrasonic probe (tip diameter 3 mm)
(Sonic & Materials. Inc.) until no obvious large particles were observed. (2) The
resulting polymer solution was cast on a glass plate (8 cm  x  10 cm) with a 0.1 to
1 ml pipette. Polymer phase separation was observed. (3) The glass plate with
membranes was put in an oven (MTI Corporation); the membranes were then

[0125]     The dried PSMIM-Cl and PPO blend membrane was transparent, and
it turned white in KOH solution. The membrane mechanical strength was good.

(2) The resulting polymer solution was cast on a glass plate (8 cm   x 10 cm) with

were then dried at 80'C for 4 hours and then 120'C for another 3 hours under
nitrogen protection. (4) After the oven temperature cooled down to room

soaked in 1 M KOH solution for at least 24 hours for complete anion exchange
(Cl- -* OH-) before testing.
[0132]     The obtained PSMIM-Cl and PE membrane was off-white with decent
mechanical strength.
[0133]     The PSMIM-Cl and PE blend membrane #11 preparation procedure
was used for the preparation of PSMIM-Cl and PE blend membrane #12. The
ratio of PSMIM-Cl solution to PE solution is shown in Table 7 below.
[0134]     The membranes were tested and determined to meet the classification
as a Helper Membrane according to the test set forth in the Summary of the
Invention section of the present application. The test results are summarized in

[0135]    Notice that these four polymer mixtures are Helper Membranes, and
they are all stronger than PSMMIM.
[0136]    Many polymers related to PBI, PPO, Nylon and PE could also be
added to the membrane to improve its strength. PE is a polyolefin. Other
polyolefins and chlorinated or fluorinated polyolefins could also be blended
with PSMMIM to produce a helper catalyst. PBI contains cyclic amines in its
repeat unit. Other polymers containing cyclic amines could also be blended with
PSMMIM to produce a Helper Membrane. PPO contains phenylene groups.
Other polymers containing phenylene or phenyl groups could also be blended
with PSMMIM to produce a Helper Membrane. Nylon contains amine and
carboxylate linkages. Other polymers containing amine or carboxylate linkages
could also be blended with PSMMIM to produce a Helper Membrane.
Specific Example 7
[0137]    The objective of this example is to identify a Helper Membrane that
does not contain styrene. In particular it will be shown that a terpolymer of
methyl methacrylate (MMA), butyl acrylate (BA), and the 1-methyl imidazole
adduct of VBC, which will be referred to as methylimidazolium
poly(vinylbenzylchloride-co-methyl methacrylate-co-butylacrylate) chloride
(PVMBMIM-Cl) is a Helper Membrane.
[0138]    PVMBMIM-Cl solution was prepared by a two-step reaction process:
(1) poly(VBC-co-MMA-co-BA) synthesis from the reaction of 4-vinylbenzyl
chloride (VBC), methyl methacrylate (MMA) and butylacrylate (BA) in toluene
under nitrogen gas (S.J. Smith) protection with 2,2'-Azobis(2
methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) as initiator; then (2) reacting poly(VBC-co-MMA
co-BA) with 1-methylimidazole at room temperature for more than 24 hours to
obtained PVMBMIM-Cl polymer solution.

butylacrylate): monomers (Sigma-Aldrich) (MMA: 4.511 g, BA: 4.702 g, VBC:
4.701 g) were polymerized in toluene (Sigma-Aldrich) (25 ml) with AIBN
(0.0811 g) as initiator. The reaction was kept at 50-550 C for 41.62 hours under
nitrogen protection with vigorous stirring. Terpolymer was precipitated out in
methanol (Avantor Performance Materials Inc.) and washed with methanol for
several times. The obtained polymer powder was dried in an oven at 80'C for 2
hours and then 120'C for another 2 hours. 6.4319 g polymer powder was
collected (yield: 46.23%). VBC content in the copolymer was 33.79 wt%.

chloride (PVMBMIM-Cl): 1-methylimidazole (Sigma-Aldrich) (0.55 ml,
0.5616 g) was added to the solution of the poly(VBC-co-MMA-co-BA) (2.06 g)
in anhydrous NN-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (Sigma-Aldrich) (15 ml). The
mixture was stirred at room temperature for more than 26 hours.
 [0141]   Membrane preparation: 1) PVMBMIM-Cl polymer solution prepared
above was cast onto a flat glass (8 cm x 10 cm) with a 0.1 to 1 ml pipette. (2)
The membrane was air dried at room temperature for overnight. (3) The glass
plate with membranes was put in an oven (MTI Corporation); the membranes
were then dried at 80'C for 2 hours and then 120'C for another 2 hours under
the protection of nitrogen. (4) After the oven temperature cooled down to room
temperature, the membranes were taken out and soaked in a 1 M KOH (Fisher
Scientific) bath. Membranes were peeled off from the substrates and soaked in 1
M KOH solution for at least 24 hours for completely anion exchange (Cl
OH-) before testing.
 [0142]    The PVMBMIM-Cl membrane was transparent with very good
mechanical strength. The membranes were tested according to the test set forth

                                        - 41
in the Summary of the Invention section of the present application with results
set forth in Table 8 below.

[0143]      The membranes were tested and determined to meet the classification
as a Helper Membrane according to the test set forth in the Summary of the
Invention section of the present application. The membrane supported 55
mA/cm 2 of CO 2 conversion current at an applied potential of 2.8 V. The
selectivity was about 90%. Therefore, PVMBMIM is a Helper Membrane.
Specific Example 8
[0144]      The objective of this example is to demonstrate that hydrophilic
materials can be added to the membrane to improve water retention. In this
example, hygroscopic oxide materials were introduced during the membrane
preparation to improve water uptake and water retention in the membrane.
Hygroscopic oxide materials include silica (SiO 2 ), zirconia (ZrO2), and titania
(TiO 2 ). In this example, zirconia was tested.
[0145]      Zirconium (IV) propoxide (70 wt. % in propanol, 333972, Sigma
Aldrich) was mixed with the polymer solution prepared as set forth in Specific
Example 1 for the synthetic route depicted in FIG. 2 to 15 wt% in DMF. The
mixture was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 30 minutes to obtain a

                                       - 42
homogeneous solution. The solution containing zirconia was cast to form a
membrane on a glass slide following the procedure set forth in Specific
Example 1 for casting the PSMMIM solution. The membrane was dried at 80'C
for 1 hour and 120'C for 30 minutes in a vacuum oven. Then the membrane was
detached from the glass slide in 1 M KOH solution and allowed to exchange to
the hydroxide form. The membrane was rinsed with demonized water to remove
free KOH and was sandwiched between an Ag cathode and a RuO2 anode
following the procedure set forth in the Summary of the Invention section of the
present application to classify as a Helper Membrane. The whole assembly was
mounted in a Fuel Cell Technologies 5 cm 2 fuel cell. The membrane showed 60
mA/cm 2 at 2.8 V with 84% selectivity so the membrane is a Helper Membrane.
Specific Example 9
[0146]    The objective of this example is to demonstrate that a deliquescent
material, ZnBr, can be added to the membrane to improve water retention.
[0147]    The cathode was prepared as follows. First a silver nanoparticle ink
was prepared via the addition of 50 mg of silver nanoparticles (20-40 nm,
45509, Alfa Aesar) to 0.8 mL of demonized water (18.2 Mohm, Millipore) and
0.4 mL of isopropanol (3032-16, Macron). The mixture was then sonicated for
one minute. The resulting silver ink was air-brushed onto carbon fiber paper
(Toray Paper 120, 40% wet-proofing, Toray Industries Inc., Tokyo, Japan)
covering an area of 5 cm x 5 cm. This square was then cut into four equally
sized squares of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm each.
[0148]    The anode was prepared the same way in each cell, as follows. First a
ruthenium oxide nanoparticle ink was prepared via the addition of 50 mg of
RuO2 nanoparticles (11804, Alfa Aesar) to 0.8 mL of demonized water (18.2

                                       - 43
Mohm, Millipore) and 0.4 mL of isopropanol (3032-16, Macron). The mixture
was then sonicated for one minute. The resulting RuO2 ink was air-brushed onto
carbon fiber paper (Toray Paper 120, 40% wet-proofing) covering an area of 5
cm x 5 cm. This square was then cut into four equally-sized squares of 2.5 cm x
2.5 cm each.
[0149]    For the cell with ZnBr added to the membrane surface, 25 mg of ZnBr
(Sigma Aldrich, 02128) were spread across the surface of a PSMMIM
membrane prepared as set forth in Specific Example 5 for the synthesis of
poly(4-vinylbenzyl chloride-co-styrene). For the cell with ZnBr incorporated
into the membrane solution, 7.5 mg of ZnBr were added to 3 ml of membrane
solution prior to casting. The PSMMIM membrane was then cast and prepared
in the typical fashion as described previously.
[0150]    For each cell, the cathode, PSMIM membrane, and anode were
sandwiched together such that the metal catalysts of each electrode faced the
membrane. The assembly was mounted in a Fuel Cell Technologies 5 cm 2 fuel
cell with serpentine graphite flow fields.
[0151]    Each cell was tested by holding the cell at 2.8 V for at least one hour.
Air was permitted to flow over the anode flow field while humidified CO 2 was
passed through the cathode flow field at a flow rate of 15 sccm.
[0152]    In the case of the membrane with a ZnBr coating, the initial current
was only 22 mA/cm 2 but it was very stable. No membrane dry-out was detected.
[0153]     The membrane that had been soaked in ZnBr initially showed 60
mA/cm 2 current, but fell to 22 mA/cm 2 after about 1 hour.
[0154]     Still, both membranes are Helper Membranes.

                                       - 44
Specific Example 10
 [0155]    The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate that Helper
Membranes are useful for water electrolyzers.
 [0156]   A 50-300 micron thick PSMMIM membrane was synthesized as in
Specific Example 1. The membrane was sandwiched between the anode and the
cathode with the catalysts facing the membrane. A cathode is prepared as
follows: a cathode ink was made by mixing 30 mg of IrO2 nanoparticles
(A17849, Alfa Aesar) with 0.2 ml demonized water (18.2 Mohm, Millipore) and
0.4 ml isopropanol (3032-16, Macron). The mixture was then sonicated for 1
minute. The cathode ink was sprayed onto a gas diffusion layer (Sigracet 35 BC
GDL, Ion Power) covering an area of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm. An anode was prepared
as follows: a catalyst ink was made by mixing 15 mg of Pt black (43838, Alfa
Aesar) with 0.2 ml demonized water (18.2 Mohm Millipore), 0.2 ml isopropanol
(3032-16, Macron). The anode catalyst ink was hand-painted onto a gas
diffusion layer (Sigracet 35 BC GDL, Ion Power) covering an area of 2.5 cm x
2.5 cm. The whole assembly was mounted in Fuel Cell Technologies 5 cm 2 fuel
cell hardware with serpentine flow fields. A 1 M KOH solution of water is fed
to both cathode and anode chambers at a flow rate of 5 sccm. The cell was run
at room temperature either potential dynamically or at constant current. For
instance, the current output was 300 and 400 mA/cm 2 at a cell potential of 1.8 V
and 1.9 V, respectively.
 [0157]    The use of an anion exchange membrane also enables the use of non
precious metal as catalysts. Nickel foam (EQ-bcnf- 16m, MTI) was used as both
cathode and anode. A current density of 80 mA/cm 2 was achieved at a cell
potential of 2 V and room temperature.

Specific Example 11
[0158]     This example shows that Helper Membranes are also useful for
alkaline membrane fuel cells.
[0159]     Pt black (43838, Alfa Aesar) was used as the catalysts for both
cathode and anode. The catalysts ink was made by mixing 15 mg of Pt black
with 0.4 ml of anion exchange polymer solution (1 wt% in DMF) and was hand
painted onto a gas diffusion layer (Sigracet 35 BC GDL, Ion Power) covering
an area of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm. The electrodes were dried under vacuum at 120'C
for 30 minutes. A 50-300 micrometer thick membrane prepared as set forth in
Specific Example 1 for the preparation of the first inhibitor-free styrene was
sandwiched between cathode and anode, with the respective catalysts facing the
membrane. The entire assembly was mounted in Fuel Cell Technologies 5 cm 2
fuel cell hardware with serpentine flow fields. H 2 and 02 were humidified via
350 cc water bottles at room temperature, and were fed to anode and cathode
chambers at 20 ccm, respectively. The cell was run at room temperature and
atmosphere pressure. The cell was conditioned by repeatedly applying a cell
potential of 0.3 V and 0.6 V for 1 hour until the cell performance was stable.
Currents of 60 mA and 150 mA were achieved at 0.6 V and 0.2 V, respectively.
A power of 36 mW was attained at ambient conditions.

[0160]     The objective of this example is to provide a Helper Membrane made
from methylimidazolium-poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) bromide

according to the literature (Reactive & Functional Polymers 70 (2010) 944
950), a detail procedure can be summarized as follows: NBS (2.84g, 15.96
mmol) (Sigma-Aldrich) and AIBN (0. 12g, 0.73 mmol) were added to a solution
of PPO (2.839, 24.08 mmol) (Sigma-Aldrich) in chlorobenzene (200 ml). The
mixture was stirred at 125-135'C for 4-6 hours under nitrogen protection, the
reaction mixture was then added to excess methanol to precipitate the product.
After filtration and washing with methanol for several times, the polymer was
dried at room temperature under vacuum for more than 2 days. 2.45 g of light
yellow powder was collected (yield: 51.14%). The bromination ratio of PPO-Br
was calculated from the integration of the NMR methyl peak and methylene
peak (18.30%):

according to the literature (Journal of Membrane Science 425-426 (2013) 131

(Sigma-Aldrich) and AIBN (0.4g, 2.4 mmol) were added to a solution of PPO
(2.89, 24.1 mmol) (Sigma-Aldrich) in chlorobenzene (160ml). The mixture was
stirred at 125-135'C for 18 hours under nitrogen protection, the reaction
mixture was then added to excess Methanol to precipitate the product. After
filtration and washing with methanol for several times, the polymer was dried at
room temperature under vacuum for more than 2 days. 3.04 g of light yellow

mixture was stirred at room temperature to 65'C for 18 hours. Brown polymer
separated from the solution at the end of the reaction.

[0168]     The objective of this example is to determine whether a
methylimidazolium-poly(4-vinylbenzylchloride membrane with no styrene is
also a Helper Membrane.
[0169]     The objective of this example is to provide a Helper Membrane made
from methylimidazolium-poly(vinylbenzylchloride) chloride (PVMIM-Cl)
polymer solution.
[0170]    PVMIM-Cl solution was prepared from commercial available
poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) (PVBC) and 1-methylimidazole as shown in the

[0171]    Synthesis of methylimidazolium-PVBC (PVMIM-Cl): 1
methylimiazole (Sigma-Aldrich) (2.33 ml, 29.23 mmol) was added to the
solution of the PVBC (Sigma-Aldrich) (4.9466 g) in anhydrous NN
Dimethylformamide (DMF) (Sigma-Aldrich) (40 mL). The mixture was stirred
at room temperature for 46.9 hours. PVMIM-Cl polymer solution was not stable
and not suitable for long time storage.
[0172]    Membranes preparation: (1) Cast PVMIM-Cl polymer solution
prepared above onto a flat glass (8 cm x 10 cm) with a 0.1 to 1 ml pipette. (2)
Put the glass plate with membranes in an oven (MTI Corporation); the
membranes were then dried at 80'C for 4 hours and then 120'C for another 2
hours under the protection of nitrogen. (3) After the oven temperature cooled
down to room temperature, the membranes were taken out and soaked in a 1 M
KOH (Fisher Scientific) bath. Membranes were peeled off from the substrates
and soaked in 1 M KOH solution for at least 24 hours for complete anion
exchange (Cl- -* OH-) before testing.
[0173]    In this case, when the membrane was exposed to water, it swelled to
form a gel-like structure which was too soft to test. So it is uncertain as to
whether the membrane is a Helper Membrane. This example indicates that
methylimidazolium-poly(4-vinylbenzylchloride membrane with no styrene, PBI
or other copolymers is not a suitable membrane. Instead, at least 10% of one of
another polymer such as styrene or PBI is needed to make a suitable membrane.

The mixtures were kept at room temperature and ultrasonicated for 1 hour. (4)
The resulting polymer solution was cast on a glass plate (8 cm x 10 cm) with a
0.1 to 1 ml pipette. (5) The glass plate with membranes was put in an oven
(MTI Corporation); the membranes were then dried at 70'C overnight and then
120'C for another 3 hours under vacuum. (6) After the oven temperature cooled
down to room temperature, the membranes were taken out and soaked in DI
water. (7) The membrane was dried at 200'C for 1 hour. (8) The PVBC/PBI
membrane was soaked in 1-methylimidazole solution for 2 days. (9) The
membrane was rinsed with DI water and the membrane was then soaked in a 1
M KOH (Fisher Scientific) bath for at least 24 hours for complete anion
exchange (Cl- -* OH-) before testing.
