                   CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001]     The present application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Application No.
61/602,418, filed on February 23, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety.
                                     TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]     The present technology relates generally to aromatic-cationic peptide compositions
and methods of use in treating, preventing or ameliorating the symptoms of autoimmune
diseases or conditions.
                                        BACKGROUND
[0003]     Autoimmune diseases are characterized by immunologic responses to aspects of
the body's own tissues. Autoimmune diseases can be broadly divided into two categories
depending on the principal clinical and pathological disease features: those that damage
many organs (systemic), and those where only a single organ or tissue is directly damaged
by the autoimmune process (localized). Systemic autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid
arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic sclerosis,
among others, are often characterized by autoantibodies reactive with a wide variety of
autoantigens including DNA, cell surface molecules, and intracellular matrix proteins.
Although the causes of systemic autoimmunity remain unclear, several immunological
mechanisms have been implicated, along with genetic and environmental factors.
                                          SUMMARY
[0004]     In some aspects, the present technology provides methods for treating a subject
suffering from an autoimmune disease, for reducing cardiolipin oxidation in a subject
suffering from an autoimmune disease, and/or for reducing inflammation in a subject
suffering from an autoimmune disease by administering a therapeutically effective amount
of an aromatic-cationic peptide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to the subject.
In some embodiments of the methods, the autoimmune disease is characterized by an
increased level of antibodies against cardiolipin. In some embodiments, the autoimmune
disease is systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome.

  WO 2013/126775                                                            PCT/US2013/027430
[0005]     In some embodiments of the methods disclosed herein, the aromatic-cationic
peptide administered to the subject includes one or more peptides selected from the group
consisting of 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-02), Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-20), D
Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-31), 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19), where
(atn)Dap is j-anthraniloyl-L-a, -diaminopropionic acid, and 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys
NH 2 (SS-36), where Ald is -(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine. In some
embodiments, the salt is an acetate salt or trifluoroacetate salt. In some embodiments, the
peptide comprises D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1).
[0006]      In some embodiments, administering a therapeutically effective amount of an
aromatic-cationic peptide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to the subject in
need thereof (e.g., to treat an autoimmune disease, to reduce cardiolipin oxidation and/or to
reduce inflammation in a subject suffering from an autoimmune disease) results in a
reduction of one or more symptoms of an autoimmune disease. For example, in some
embodiments, the subject is suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus, and aromatic
cationic peptide administration reduces or ameliorates one or more symptoms of systemic
lupus erythematosus, wherein the symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus are one or
more symptoms selected from the group consisting of: increased cardiolipin antibody levels,
fever, vascular thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, heart valve disease, livedo reticularis,
pleuritis, pleural effusion, lupus pneumonitis, chronic diffuse interstitial lung disease,
pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary emboli, pulmonary hemorrhage, shrinking lung
syndrome, pericarditis, myocarditis, endocarditis, anemia, low platelet and white cell count,
prolonged partial thromboplastin time, osteoarticular tuberculosis, myalgia, malar rash,
discoid lupus, allopecia, mouth, nasal, urinary tract and vaginal ulcers, polyneuropathy, and
intracranial hypertension syndrome.
[0007]     In some embodiments, the aromatic-cationic peptide is administered orally,
parenterally, intravenously, subcutaneously, transdermally, topically or by inhalation.

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0033]    It is to be appreciated that certain aspects, modes, embodiments, variations and
features of the invention are described below in various levels of detail in order to provide a
substantial understanding of the present invention. The definitions of certain terms as used
in this specification are provided below. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and
scientific terms used herein generally have the same meaning as commonly understood by
one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.
[0034]    In practicing the present disclosure, many conventional techniques of cell biology,
molecular biology, protein biochemistry, immunology, and bacteriology are used. These
techniques are well-known in the art and are provided in any number of available
publications, including CurrentProtocolsin MolecularBiology, Vols. I-III, Ausubel, Ed.
(1997); Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A LaboratoryManual, Second Ed. (Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989).
[0035]    As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an"
and "the" include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. For
example, reference to "a cell" includes a combination of two or more cells, and the like.
[0036]    As used herein, the "administration" of an agent, drug, or peptide to a subject
includes any route of introducing or delivering to a subject a compound to perform its
intended function. Administration can be carried out by any suitable route, including orally,
nasally, parenterally (intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or subcutaneously),
topically, epicutaneously, rectally, intradermally, transdermally, inhalation, intraarterially,
intracerebrally, interosseusly, intrathecally, iontophoretically, ocularly, intravaginaly, etc.
Administration includes self-administration and the administration by another.
[0037]    As used herein, the term "amino acid" includes naturally-occurring amino acids
and synthetic amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that
function in a manner similar to the naturally-occurring amino acids. Naturally-occurring
                                                 6

  WO 2013/126775                                                           PCT/US2013/027430
amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are
later modified, e.g., hydroxyproline, y-carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino
acid analogs refers to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally
occurring amino acid, i.e., an a-carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an
amino group, and an R group, e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide,
methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or
modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally
occurring amino acid. Amino acid mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a
structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid, but that
functions in a manner similar to a naturally-occurring amino acid. Amino acids can be
referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter
symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission.
[0038]     As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers to a quantity sufficient to
achieve a desired therapeutic and/or prophylactic effect. In the context of therapeutic or
prophylactic applications, the amount of a composition administered to the subject will
depend on the type and severity of the disease and on the characteristics of the individual,
such as general health, age, sex, body weight and tolerance to drugs. It will also depend on
the degree, severity and type of disease. The skilled artisan will be able to determine
appropriate dosages depending on these and other factors. The compositions can also be
administered in combination with one or more additional therapeutic compounds. In some
embodiments the term "effective amount" refers to a quantity sufficient to achieve a desired
therapeutic effect, e.g., to aleviate or ameliorate the signs or symptoms of a disease or
condition, such as antiphospholipid syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus.
[0039]     As used herein, "exogenous nucleic acid" refers to nucleic acid (e.g., DNA, RNA)
that is not naturally present within a host cell but is introduced from an outside source. As
used herein, exogenous nucleic acid refers to nucleic acid that has not integrated in to the
genome of the host cell but remains separate, such as a bacterial plasmid nucleic acid. As
used herein, "bacterial plasmid" refers to a circular DNA of bacterial origin which serves as
a carrier of a sequence of interest and a means for expressing that sequence in a bacterial
host cell.
[0040]     An "isolated" or "purified" polypeptide or peptide is substantially free of cellular
material or other contaminating polypeptides from the cell or tissue source from which the
                                                 7

  WO 2013/126775                                                          PCT/US2013/027430
agent is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when
chemically synthesized. For example, an isolated aromatic-cationic peptide or an isolated
cytochrome c protein would be free of materials that would interfere with diagnostic or
therapeutic uses of the agent or would interfere with conductance, or electric properties of
the peptide. Such interfering materials may include enzymes, hormones and other
proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous solutes.
[0041]    As used herein, "inducible promoter" refers to a promoter that is influenced by
certain conditions, such as temperature or the presence of specific molecules, and promotes
the expression of operably linked nucleic acid sequences of interest only when those
conditions are met.
[0042]    As used herein, "constitutive promoter" refers to a promoter that facilitates
expression of operably linked nucleic acid sequences of interest under all or most
environmental conditions.
[0043]    As used herein, the terms "polypeptide", "peptide", and "protein" are used
interchangeably herein to mean a polymer comprising two or more amino acids joined to
each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds, i.e., peptide isosteres. Polypeptide
refers to both short chains, commonly referred to as peptides, glycopeptides or oligomers,
and to longer chains, generally referred to as proteins. Polypeptides may contain amino
acids other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. Polypeptides include amino acid
sequences modified either by natural processes, such as post-translational processing, or by
chemical modification techniques that are well known in the art.
[0044]    As used herein, "recombinant bacteria" refers to bacteria that have been
engineered to carry and /or express one or more exogenous nucleic acid (e.g., DNA)
sequences.
[0045]    As used herein, the terms "treating" or "treatment" or "alleviation" refers to both
therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to
prevent or slow down (lessen) the targeted pathologic condition or disorder. It is also to be
appreciated that the various modes of treatment or prevention of medical conditions as
described are intended to mean "substantial", which includes total but also less than total
treatment or prevention, and wherein some biologically or medically relevant result is
achieved.

  WO 2013/126775                                                           PCT/US2013/027430
[0046]    As used herein, "prevention" or "preventing" of a disorder or condition refers to a
compound that reduces the occurrence of the disorder or condition in the treated sample
relative to an untreated control sample, or delays the onset or reduces the severity of one or
more symptoms of the disorder or condition relative to the untreated control sample.
Aromatic-cationic peptides
[0047]    The present technology relates to the use of aromatic-cationic peptides. In some
embodiments, the peptides are useful in aspects related to treating or ameliorating
symptoms, conditions or diseases characterized by the presence of anti-cardiolipin
antibodies, such as antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus.
[0048]    The aromatic-cationic peptides are water-soluble and highly polar. Despite these
properties, the peptides can readily penetrate cell membranes. The aromatic-cationic
peptides typically include a minimum of three amino acids or a minimum of four amino
acids, covalently joined by peptide bonds. The maximum number of amino acids present in
the aromatic-cationic peptides is about twenty amino acids covalently joined by peptide
bonds. Suitably, the maximum number of amino acids is about twelve, about nine, or about
six.
[0049]    The amino acids of the aromatic-cationic peptides can be any amino acid. As used
herein, the term "amino acid" is used to refer to any organic molecule that contains at least
one amino group and at least one carboxyl group. Typically, at least one amino group is at
the a position relative to a carboxyl group. The amino acids may be naturally occurring.
Naturally occurring amino acids include, for example, the twenty most common
levorotatory (L) amino acids normally found in mammalian proteins, i.e., alanine (Ala),
arginine (Arg), asparagine (Asn), aspartic acid (Asp), cysteine (Cys), glutamine (Gln),
glutamic acid (Glu), glycine (Gly), histidine (His), isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), lysine
(Lys), methionine (Met), phenylalanine (Phe), proline (Pro), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr),
tryptophan, (Trp), tyrosine (Tyr), and valine (Val). Other naturally occurring amino acids
include, for example, amino acids that are synthesized in metabolic processes not associated
with protein synthesis. For example, the amino acids ornithine and citrulline are
synthesized in mammalian metabolism during the production of urea. Another example of a
naturally occurring amino acid includes hydroxyproline (Hyp).

[0050]      The peptides optionally contain one or more non-naturally occurring amino acids.
Optimally, the peptide has no amino acids that are naturally occurring. The non-naturally
occurring amino acids may be levorotary (L-), dextrorotatory (D-), or mixtures thereof Non
naturally occurring amino acids are those amino acids that typically are not synthesized in
normal metabolic processes in living organisms, and do not naturally occur in proteins. In
addition, the non-naturally occurring amino acids suitably are also not recognized by
common proteases. The non-naturally occurring amino acid can be present at any position
in the peptide. For example, the non-naturally occurring amino acid can be at the N
terminus, the C-terminus, or at any position between the N-terminus and the C-terminus.
[0051]      The non-natural amino acids may, for example, comprise alkyl, aryl, or alkylaryl
groups not found in natural amino acids. Some examples of non-natural alkyl amino acids
include a-aminobutyric acid, j-aminobutyric acid, y-aminobutyric acid, 6-aminovaleric
acid, and c-aminocaproic acid. Some examples of non-natural aryl amino acids include
ortho-, meta, and para-aminobenzoic acid. Some examples of non-natural alkylaryl amino
acids include ortho-, meta-, and para-aminophenylacetic acid, and y-phenyl-j-aminobutyric
acid. Non-naturally occurring amino acids include derivatives of naturally occurring amino
acids. The derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids may, for example, include the
addition of one or more chemical groups to the naturally occurring amino acid.
[0052]      For example, one or more chemical groups can be added to one or more of the 2',
3', 4', 5', or 6' position of the aromatic ring of a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue, or the 4',
5', 6', or 7' position of the benzo ring of a tryptophan residue. The group can be any
chemical group that can be added to an aromatic ring. Some examples of such groups
include branched or unbranched C1 -C 4 alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl,
butyl, isobutyl, or t-butyl, CI-C 4 alkyloxy (i.e., alkoxy), amino, C 1-C 4 alkylamino and C1 -C 4
dialkylamino (e.g., methylamino, dimethylamino), nitro, hydroxyl, halo (i.e., fluoro, chloro,
bromo, or iodo). Some specific examples of non-naturally occurring derivatives of
naturally occurring amino acids include norvaline (Nva) and norleucine (Nle).
[0053]      Another example of a modification of an amino acid in a peptide is the
derivatization of a carboxyl group of an aspartic acid or a glutamic acid residue of the
peptide. One example of derivatization is amidation with ammonia or with a primary or
secondary amine, e.g. methylamine, ethylamine, dimethylamine or diethylamine. Another
example of derivatization includes esterification with, for example, methyl or ethyl alcohol.

  WO 2013/126775                                                           PCT/US2013/027430
Another such modification includes derivatization of an amino group of a lysine, arginine,
or histidine residue. For example, such amino groups can be acylated. Some suitable acyl
groups include, for example, a benzoyl group or an alkanoyl group comprising any of the
C1 -C4 alkyl groups mentioned above, such as an acetyl or propionyl group.
[0054]    The non-naturally occurring amino acids are suitably resistant or insensitive, to
common proteases. Examples of non-naturally occurring amino acids that are resistant or
insensitive to proteases include the dextrorotatory (D-) form of any of the above-mentioned
naturally occurring L-amino acids, as well as L-and/or D- non-naturally occurring amino
acids. The D-amino acids do not normally occur in proteins, although they are found in
certain peptide antibiotics that are synthesized by means other than the normal ribosomal
protein synthetic machinery of the cell. As used herein, the D-amino acids are considered to
be non-naturally occurring amino acids.
[0055]     In order to minimize protease sensitivity, the peptides should have less than five,
less than four, less than three, or less than two contiguous L-amino acids recognized by
common proteases, irrespective of whether the amino acids are naturally or non-naturally
occurring. In one embodiment, the peptide has only D-amino acids, and no L-amino acids.
If the peptide contains protease sensitive sequences of amino acids, at least one of the amino
acids is preferably a non-naturally-occurring D-amino acid, thereby conferring protease
resistance. An example of a protease sensitive sequence includes two or more contiguous
basic amino acids that are readily cleaved by common proteases, such as endopeptidases
and trypsin. Examples of basic amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine.
[0056]    The aromatic-cationic peptides should have a minimum number of net positive
charges at physiological pH in comparison to the total number of amino acid residues in the
peptide. The minimum number of net positive charges at physiological pH will be referred
to below as (pm). The total number of amino acid residues in the peptide will be referred to
below as (r). The minimum number of net positive charges discussed below are all at
physiological pH. The term "physiological pH" as used herein refers to the normal pH in
the cells of the tissues and organs of the mammalian body. For instance, the physiological
pH of a human is normally approximately 7.4, but normal physiological pH in mammals
may be any pH from about 7.0 to about 7.8.

  WO 2013/126775                                                           PCT/US2013/027430
[0057]    "Net charge" as used herein refers to the balance of the number of positive charges
and the number of negative charges carried by the amino acids present in the peptide. In
this specification, it is understood that net charges are measured at physiological pH. The
naturally occurring amino acids that are positively charged at physiological pH include L
lysine, L-arginine, and L-histidine. The naturally occurring amino acids that are negatively
charged at physiological pH include L-aspartic acid and L-glutamic acid.
[0058]    Typically, a peptide has a positively charged N-terminal amino group and a
negatively charged C-terminal carboxyl group. The charges cancel each other out at
physiological pH. As an example of calculating net charge, the peptide Tyr-Arg-Phe-Lys
Glu-His-Trp-D-Arg has one negatively charged amino acid (i.e., Glu) and four positively
charged amino acids (i.e., two Arg residues, one Lys, and one His). Therefore, the above
peptide has a net positive charge of three.
[0059]    In one embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a relationship between the
minimum number of net positive charges at physiological pH (pm) and the total number of
amino acid residues (r) wherein 3 pm is the largest number that is less than or equal to r + 1.
In this embodiment, the relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges
(pm) and the total number of amino acid residues (r) is as follows:
           TABLE 1. Amino acid number and net positive charges ( 3 pm p+1)

[0060]    In another embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a relationship between
the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and the total number of amino acid
residues (r) wherein 2 pm is the largest number that is less than or equal to r + 1. In this
embodiment, the relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges (pm)
and the total number of amino acid residues (r) is as follows:

[0061]       In one embodiment, the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and the total
number of amino acid residues (r) are equal. In another embodiment, the peptides have
three or four amino acid residues and a minimum of one net positive charge, suitably, a
minimum of two net positive charges and more preferably a minimum of three net positive
charges.
[0062]       It is also important that the aromatic-cationic peptides have a minimum number of
aromatic groups in comparison to the total number of net positive charges (pt). The
minimum number of aromatic groups will be referred to below as (a). Naturally occurring
amino acids that have an aromatic group include the amino acids histidine, tryptophan,
tyrosine, and phenylalanine. For example, the hexapeptide Lys-Gln-Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Trp has
a net positive charge of two (contributed by the lysine and arginine residues) and three
aromatic groups (contributed by tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan residues).
[0063]      The aromatic-cationic peptides should also have a relationship between the
minimum number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of net positive charges at
physiological pH (pt) wherein 3a is the largest number that is less than or equal to pt + 1,
except that when pt is 1, a may also be 1. In this embodiment, the relationship between the
minimum number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of net positive charges (pt) is
as follows:
         TABLE 3. Aromatic groups and net positive charges (3a < pt+1 or a= pt=l)

[0064]       In another embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a relationship between
the minimum number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of net positive charges
(pt) wherein 2a is the largest number that is less than or equal to pt + 1. In this embodiment,

the relationship between the minimum number of aromatic amino acid residues (a) and the
total number of net positive charges (pt) is as follows:
       TABLE 4. Aromatic groups and net positive charges (2a < pt+1 or a= pt=1)

[0065]     In another embodiment, the number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of
net positive charges (p1 ) are equal.
[0066]     Carboxyl groups, especially the terminal carboxyl group of a C-terminal amino
acid, are suitably amidated with, for example, ammonia to form the C-terminal amide.
Alternatively, the terminal carboxyl group of the C-terminal amino acid may be amidated
with any primary or secondary amine. The primary or secondary amine may, for example,
be an alkyl, especially a branched or unbranched C1-C4 alkyl, or an aryl amine.
Accordingly, the amino acid at the C-terminus of the peptide may be converted to an amido,
N-methylamido, N-ethylamido, N,N-dimethylamido, N,N-diethylamido, N-methyl-N
ethylamido, N-phenylamido or N-phenyl-N-ethylamido group. The free carboxylate groups
of the asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid residues not occurring at the
C-terminus of the aromatic-cationic peptides may also be amidated wherever they occur
within the peptide. The amidation at these internal positions may be with ammonia or any
of the primary or secondary amines described above.
[0067]     In one embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptide is a tripeptide having two net
positive charges and at least one aromatic amino acid. In a particular embodiment, the
aromatic-cationic peptide is a tripeptide having two net positive charges and two aromatic
amino acids.
[0068]     In yet another aspect, the present technology provides an aromatic-cationic peptide
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof such as acetate salt or trifluoroacetate salt. In
some embodiments, the peptide comprises
         1.      at least one net positive charge;
        2.       a minimum of three amino acids;

total number of net positive charges (pr) wherein 2a is the largest number that is less than or

[0083]   In some embodiments, peptides useful in the methods of the present invention are
those peptides which have a tyrosine residue or a tyrosine derivative. In some
embodiments, derivatives of tyrosine include 2'-methyltyrosine (Mmt); 2',6'
dimethyltyrosine (2'6'Dmt); 3',5'-dimethyltyrosine (3'5'Dmt); N,2',6'-trimethyltyrosine
(Tmt); and 2'-hydroxy-6'-methyltryosine (Hmt).

[0084]    In one embodiment, the peptide has the formula Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (referred
to herein as SS-01). SS-01 has a net positive charge of three, contributed by the amino
acids tyrosine, arginine, and lysine and has two aromatic groups contributed by the amino
acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. The tyrosine of SS-01 can be a modified derivative of
tyrosine such as in 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine to produce the compound having the formula
2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH      2 (referred to herein as SS-02).
[0085]    In a suitable embodiment, the amino acid residue at the N-terminus is arginine. An
example of such a peptide is D-Arg-2',6'Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (referred to herein as SS-31).
[0086]    In another embodiment, the amino acid at the N-terminus is phenylalanine or its
derivative. In some embodiments, derivatives of phenylalanine include 2'
methylphenylalanine (Mmp), 2',6'-dimethylphenylalanine (Dmp), N,2',6'
trimethylphenylalanine (Tmp), and 2'-hydroxy-6'-methylphenylalanine (Hmp). An example
of such a peptide is Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (referred to herein as SS-20). In one
embodiment, the amino acid sequence of SS-02 is rearranged such that Dmt is not at the N
terminus. An example of such an aromatic-cationic peptide has the formula D-Arg
2',6'Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1).
[0087]    In yet another embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptide has the formula Phe-D
Arg-Dmt-Lys-NH 2 (referred to herein as SS-30). Alternatively, the N-terminal
phenylalanine can be a derivative of phenylalanine such as 2',6'-dimethylphenylalanine
(2'6'Dmp). SS-01 containing 2',6'-dimethylphenylalanine at amino acid position one has
the formula 2',6'-Dmp-D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-NH 2 .
[0088]    In some embodiments, the aromatic cationic peptide comprises 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg
Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is j-anthraniloyl-L-a,-diaminopropionic acid,
2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH      2 (SS-36), where Ald is -(6'-dimethylamino-2'
naphthoyl)alanine, 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH         2 (SS-37), where Ald is 0-(6'
dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, D-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SPI-23 1), and 2',6'-Dmt-D
Arg-Phe-(dns)Dap-NH 2 where (dns)Dap is P-dansyl-L-a,-diaminopropionic acid (SS-17).
[0089]    The peptides mentioned herein and their derivatives can further include functional
analogs. A peptide is considered a functional analog if the analog has the same function as
the stated peptide. The analog may, for example, be a substitution variant of a peptide,
wherein one or more amino acids are substituted by another amino acid. Suitable
                                                28

substitution variants of the peptides include conservative amino acid substitutions. Amino
acids may be grouped according to their physicochemical characteristics as follows:
          (a)     Non-polar amino acids: Ala(A) Ser(S) Thr(T) Pro(P) Gly(G) Cys (C);
          (b)     Acidic amino acids: Asn(N) Asp(D) Glu(E) Gln(Q);
          (c)     Basic amino acids: His(H) Arg(R) Lys(K);
          (d)     Hydrophobic amino acids: Met(M) Leu(L) Ile(I) Val(V); and
          (e)     Aromatic amino acids: Phe(F) Tyr(Y) Trp(W) His (H).
[0090]      Substitutions of an amino acid in a peptide by another amino acid in the same
group is referred to as a conservative substitution and may preserve the physicochemical
characteristics of the original peptide. In contrast, substitutions of an amino acid in a
peptide by another amino acid in a different group is generally more likely to alter the
characteristics of the original peptide. Non-limiting examples of analogs useful in the
practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, the aromatic-cationic
peptides shown in Table 5.

Peptide Synthesis
[0099]    The peptides may be synthesized by any of the methods well known in the art.
Suitable methods for chemically synthesizing the protein include, for example, those
described by Stuart and Young in Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, Second Edition, Pierce
Chemical Company (1984), and in Methods Enzymol., 289, Academic Press, Inc, New York
(1997).
[0100]    One way of stabilizing peptides against enzymatic degradation is the replacement
of an L-amino acid with a D-amino acid at the peptide bond undergoing cleavage.
Aromatic cationic peptide analogs are prepared containing one or more D-amino acid
residues in addition to the D-Arg residue already present. Another way to prevent
enzymatic degradation is N-methylation of the a-amino group at one or more amino acid
residues of the peptides. This will prevent peptide bond cleavage by any peptidase.
Examples include: H-D-Arg-Dmt-Lys(NMe)-Phe-NH2; H-D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe(NMe)
NH 2; H-D-Arg-Dmt-Lys(NMe)-Phe(NMe)-NH2; and H-D-Arg(N"Me)-Dmt(NMe)
Lys(N"Me)-Phe(NMe)-NH 2 . N"-methylated analogues have lower hydrogen bonding
capacity and can be expected to have improved intestinal permeability.
[0101]    An alternative way to stabilize a peptide amide bond (-CO-NH-) against enzymatic
degradation is its replacement with a reduced amide bond (T[CH 2-NH]). This can be
achieved with a reductive alkylation reaction between a Boc-amino acid-aldehyde and the
amino group of the N-terminal amino acid residue of the growing peptide chain in solid
phase peptide synthesis. The reduced peptide bond is predicted to result in improved
cellular permeability because of reduced hydrogen-bonding capacity. Examples include: H
D-Arg-W[CH 2 -NH]Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2, H-D-Arg-Dmt-W[CH 2 -NH]Lys-Phe-NH 2, H-D-Arg
Dmt-LysT[CH 2 -NH]Phe-NH 2 , H-D-Arg-Dmt-T[CH 2-NH]Lys-T[CH 2-NH]Phe-NH 2 , etc.
Lipids
[0102]    Cardiolipin is an important component of the inner mitochondrial membrane,
where it constitutes about 20% of the total lipid composition. In mammalian cells,

  WO 2013/126775                                                          PCT/US2013/027430
cardiolipin is found almost exclusively in the inner mitochondrial membrane where it is
essential for the optimal function of enzymes involved in mitochondrial metabolism.
[0103]    Cardiolipin is a species of diphosphatidylglycerol lipid comprising two
phosphatidylglycerols connected with a glycerol backbone to form a dimeric structure. It
has four alkyl groups and potentially carries two negative charges. As there are four distinct
alkyl chains in cardiolipin, the molecule has the potential for great complexity. However, in
most animal tissues, cardiolipin contains 18-carbon fatty alkyl chains with 2 unsaturated
bonds on each of them. It has been proposed that the (18:2)4 acyl chain configuration is an
important structural requirement for the high affinity of cardiolipin to inner membrane
proteins in mammalian mitochondria. However, studies with isolated enzyme preparations
indicate that its importance may vary depending on the protein examined.
[0104]    Each of the two phosphates in the molecule can capture one proton. Although it
has a symmetric structure, ionization of one phosphate happens at different levels of acidity
than ionizing both, with pK1 =3 and pK2 > 7.5. Hence, under normal physiological
conditions (a pH of approximately 7.0), the molecule may carry only one negative charge.
Hydroxyl groups (-OH and -0-) on the phosphate form stable intramolecular hydrogen
bonds, forming a bicyclic resonance structure. This structure traps one proton, which is
conducive to oxidative phosphorylation.
[0105]    During the oxidative phosphorylation process catalyzed by Complex IV, large
quantities of protons are transferred from one side of the membrane to another side causing
a large pH change. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it has been suggested that
cardiolipin functions as a proton trap within the mitochondrial membranes, strictly
localizing the proton pool and minimizing pH in the mitochondrial intermembrane space.
This function is thought to be due to the unique structure of cardiolipin, which, as described
above, can trap a proton within the bicyclic structure while carrying a negative charge.
Thus, cardiolipin can serve as an electron buffer pool to release or absorb protons to
maintain the pH near the mitochondrial membranes.
[0106]    In addition, cardiolipin has been shown to play a role in apoptosis. An early event
in the apoptosis cascade involves cardiolipin. As discussed in more detail below, a
cardiolipin-specific oxygenase produces cardiolipin-hydroperoxides which causes the lipid
to undergo a conformational change. The oxidized cardiolipin then translocates from the

inner mitochondrial membrane to the outer mitochondrial membrane where it is thought to
form a pore through which cytochrome c is released into the cytosol. Cytochrome c can
bind to the IP3 receptor stimulating calcium release, which further promotes the release of
cytochrome c. When the cytoplasmic calcium concentration reaches a toxic level, the cell
dies. In addition, extra-mitochondrial cytochrome c interacts with apoptotic activating
factors, causing the formation of apoptosomal complexes and activation of the proteolytic
caspase cascade.
[0107]    Another consequence is that cytochrome c interacts with cardiolipin on the inner
mitochondrial membrane with high affinity and forms a complex with cardiolipin that is
non-productive in transporting electrons, but which acts as a cardiolipin-specific
oxygenase/peroxidase. Indeed, interaction of cardiolipin with cytochrome c yields a
complex whose normal redox potential is about minus (-) 400 mV more negative than that
of intact cytochrome c. As a result, the cytochrome c/cardiolipin complex cannot accept
electrons from mitochondrial complex III, leading to enhanced production of superoxide
whose dismutation yields H2 0 2 . The cytochrome c/cardiolipin complex also cannot accept
electrons from superoxide. In addition, the high affinity interaction of cardiolipin with
cytochrome c results in the activation of cytochrome c into a cardiolipin-specific peroxidase
with selective catalytic activity toward peroxidation of polyunsaturated molecular
cardiolipin. The peroxidase reaction of the cytochrome c/cardiolipin complex is driven by
H2 0 2 as a source of oxidizing equivalents. Ultimately, this activity results in the
accumulation of cardiolipin oxidation products, mainly cardiolipin-OOH and their reduction
products, cardiolipin-OH. As noted above, it has been shown that oxygenated cardiolipin
species play a role in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and release of pro
apoptotic factors (including cytochrome c itself) into the cytosol. See e.g., Kagan et al.,
Advanced DrugDelivery Reviews, 61 (2009) 1375-1385; Kagan et al., Mol. Nutr. Food Res.
2009 January; 53(1): 104-114, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.
[0108]     Cytochrome c is a globular protein whose major function is to serve as electron
carrier from complex III (cytochrome c reductase) to complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) in
the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The prosthetic heme group is attached to the
cytochrome c at Cys14 and Cys17, and is additionally bound by two coordinate axial
ligands, His18 and Met8O. The 6 th coordinate binding to Met8O prevents the interaction of
the Fe with other ligands such as 02, H2 0 2 , NO, etc.

[0109]      A pool of cytochrome c is distributed in the intermembrane space, with the rest
being associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) via both electrostatic and
hydrophobic interactions. Cytochrome c is a highly cationic protein (8+ net charge at
neutral pH) that can bind loosely to the anionic phospholipid cardiolipin on the IMM via
electrostatic interaction. And, as noted above, cytochrome c can also bind tightly to
cardiolipin via hydrophobic interaction. This tight binding of cytochrome c to cardiolipin
results from the extension of an acyl chain of cardiolipin out of the lipid membrane and
extending into a hydrophobic channel in the interior of cytochrome c (Tuominen et al.,
2001; Kalanxhi & Wallace, 2007; Sinabaldi et al., 2010). This leads to the rupture of the
Fe-Met8O bond in the cytochrome c heme pocket and results in a change in the heme
environment, as shown by the loss of the negative Cotton peak in the Soret band region
(Sinabaldi et al., 2008). It also leads to exposure of the heme Fe to H2 0 2 and NO.
[0110]      Native cytochrome c has poor peroxidase activity because of its 6th coordination.
However, upon hydrophobic binding to cardiolipin, cytochrome c undergoes structural
changes that breaks the Fe-Met8O coordination and increases the exposure of the heme Fe to
H 2 0 2 , and cytochrome c switches from an electron carrier to a peroxidase, with cardiolipin
being the primary substrate (Vladimirov et al., 2006; Basova et al., 2007). As described
above, cardiolipin peroxidation results in altered mitochondrial membrane structure, and the
release of cytochrome c from the IMM to initiate caspase-mediated cell death.

cardiolipin or both, hinder the cardiolipin - cytochrome c interaction, inhibit the
oxygenase/peroxidase activity of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c complex, inhibit cardiolipin
hydroperoxide formation, inhibit the translocation of cardiolipin to the outer membrane
and/or inhibit the release of cytochrome c from the IMM. Additionally or alternatively, in

some embodiments, the aromatic-cationic peptides disclosed herein include one or more of
the following characteristics or functions: (1) are cell permeable and target the inner
mitochondrial membrane; (2) selectively bind to cardiolipin via electrostatic interactions
which facilitates the interaction of the peptide with cytochrome c; (3) interact with
cytochrome c that is free and either loosely-bound or tightly-bound to cardiolipin; (4)
protect the hydrophobic heme pocket of cytochrome c and/or inhibit cardiolipin from
disrupting the Fe-Met8O bond; (5) promote     7-n*  interactions with the heme porphorin; (6)
inhibit cytochrome c peroxidase activity; (7) promote kinetics of cytochrome c reduction;
(8) prevent inhibition of cytochrome c reduction caused by cardiolipin; (9) promote electron
flux in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and ATP synthesis. In some
embodiments, the ability of the peptide to promote electron transport is not correlated with
the ability of the peptide to inhibit peroxidase activity of the cytochrome c/cardiolipin
complex. Thus, in some embodiments, the administered peptides inhibit, delay or reduce
the interaction between cardiolipin and cytochrome c. Additionally or alternatively, in
some embodiments, the administered peptides inhibit, delay or reduce the formation of
cytochrome c/cardiolipin complexes. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments,
the administered peptides inhibit, delay or reduce the oxygenase/peroxidase activity of the
cytochrome c/cardiolipin complexes. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments,
the administered peptides inhibit, delay or reduce apoptosis.

Prophylactic and Therapeutic Uses of Aromatic-Cationic Peptides
[0113]    The aromatic-cationic peptides described herein are useful to prevent or treat
disease. Specifically, the disclosure provides for both prophylactic and therapeutic methods
of treating a subject at risk of (or susceptible to) disease by administering the aromatic
cationic peptides described herein. Accordingly, the present methods provide for the
prevention and/or treatment of disease in a subject by administering an effective amount of
an aromatic-cationic peptide to a subject in need thereof.
[0114]    In one aspect, the disclosure provides a method of reducing the number of
mitochondria undergoing mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), or preventing
mitochondrial permeability transitioning in a mammal in need thereof, the method
comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of one or more aromatic
cationic peptides described herein. In another aspect, the disclosure provides a method for
increasing the ATP synthesis rate in a mammal in need thereof, the method comprising
administering to the mammal an effective amount of one or more aromatic-cationic peptides
described herein. In yet another aspect, the disclosure provides a method for reducing
oxidative damage in a mammal in need thereof, the method comprising administering to the
mammal an effective amount of one or more aromatic-cationic peptides described herein.
[0115]    Oxidative Damage. The peptides disclosed herein are useful in reducing oxidative
damage in a mammal in need thereof. Mammals in need of reducing oxidative damage are
those mammals suffering from a disease, condition or treatment associated with oxidative
damage. Typically, the oxidative damage is caused by free radicals, such as reactive
                                                 42

  WO 2013/126775                                                          PCT/US2013/027430
oxygen species (ROS) and/or reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Examples of ROS and RNS
include hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion radical, nitric oxide, hydrogen, hypochlorous
acid (HOCl) and peroxynitrite anion. Oxidative damage is considered to be "reduced" if the
amount of oxidative damage in a mammal, a removed organ, or a cell is decreased after
administration of an effective amount of the aromatic cationic peptides described above.
Typically, the oxidative damage is considered to be reduced if the oxidative damage is
decreased by at least about 10%, at least about 250%, at least about 50%, at least about 75%,
or at least about 90%, compared to a control subject not treated with the peptide.
[0116]     In some embodiments, a mammal to be treated can be a mammal with a disease or
condition associated with oxidative damage. The oxidative damage can occur in any cell,
tissue or organ of the mammal. In humans, oxidative stress is involved in many diseases.
Examples include atherosclerosis, Parkinson's disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction,
Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, fragile X syndrome and chronic
fatigue syndrome.
[0117]     In some embodiments, a mammal may be undergoing a treatment associated with
oxidative damage. For example, the mammal may be undergoing reperfusion. Reperfusion
refers to the restoration of blood flow to any organ or tissue in which the flow of blood is
decreased or blocked. The restoration of blood flow during reperfusion leads to respiratory
burst and formation of free radicals.
[0118]     In one embodiment, the mammal may have decreased or blocked blood flow due
to hypoxia or ischemia. The loss or severe reduction in blood supply during hypoxia or
ischemia may, for example, be due to thromboembolic stroke, coronary atherosclerosis, or
peripheral vascular disease. Numerous organs and tissues are subject to ischemia or
hypoxia. Examples of such organs include brain, heart, kidney, intestine and prostate. The
tissue affected is typically muscle, such as cardiac, skeletal, or smooth muscle For instance,
cardiac muscle ischemia or hypoxia is commonly caused by atherosclerotic or thrombotic
blockages which lead to the reduction or loss of oxygen delivery to the cardiac tissues by
the cardiac arterial and capillary blood supply. Such cardiac ischemia or hypoxia may cause
pain and necrosis of the affected cardiac muscle, and ultimately may lead to cardiac failure.
[0119]    The methods can also be used in reducing oxidative damage associated with any
neurodegenerative disease or condition. The neurodegenerative disease can affect any cell,
                                               43

  WO 2013/126775                                                          PCT/US2013/027430
tissue or organ of the central and peripheral nervous system. Examples of such cells, tissues
and organs include, the brain, spinal cord, neurons, ganglia, Schwann cells, astrocytes,
oligodendrocytes and microglia. The neurodegenerative condition can be an acute
condition, such as a stroke or a traumatic brain or spinal cord injury. In another
embodiment, the neurodegenerative disease or condition can be a chronic neurodegenerative
condition. In a chronic neurodegenerative condition, the free radicals can, for example,
cause damage to a protein. An example of such a protein is amyloid -protein. Examples
of chronic neurodegenerative diseases associated with damage by free radicals include
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis (also known as Lou Gherig's disease).
[0120]    MitochondrialPermeability Transitioning. The peptides disclosed herein are
useful in treating any disease or condition that is associated with mitochondria permeability
transitioning (MPT). Such diseases and conditions include, but are not limited to, ischemia
and/or reperfusion of a tissue or organ, hypoxia and any of a number of neurodegenerative
diseases. Mammals in need of inhibiting or preventing of MPT are those mammals
suffering from these diseases or conditions.
[0121]    Apoptosis. The peptides disclosed herein are useful in treating diseases or
conditions that are associated with apoptosis. Exemplary diseases or conditions include, but
are not limited to, cancers such as colorectal, glioma, hepatic, neuroblastoma, leukaemias
and lymphomata, and prostate; autoimmune diseases such as myasthenia gravis, systemic
lupus erythematosus, inflammatory diseases, bronchial asthma, inflammatory intestinal
disease, pulmonary inflammation; viral infections such as adenovirus and baculovirus and
HIV-AIDS; neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, retinitis pigmentosa and epilepsy; haematologic diseases such
as aplastic anaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, T CD4+ lymphocytopenia, and G6PD
deficiency; tissue damage such as caused by myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular
accident, ischaemic renal damage and polycystic kidney. Thus, in some embodiments,
aromatic-cationic peptides as disclosed herein (such as D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2, Phe
D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2, 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2, where (atn)Dap is 0
anthraniloyl-L-a,-diaminopropionic acid, 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 , where Ald is
(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 , where Ald is
j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine and D-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2, 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg
                                                44

  WO 2013/126775                                                           PCT/US2013/027430
Phe-(dns)Dap-NH 2 where (dns)Dap is P-dansyl-L-a,j-diaminopropionic acid or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, such as acetate or trifluoroacetate salt) are
administered to a subject (e.g., a mammal such as a human) in need thereof. As noted
above, it is thought that the peptides contact (e.g., target) cytochrome c, cardiolipin or both,
hinder the cardiolipin - cytochrome c interaction, inhibit cardiolipin-hydroperoxide
formation, inhibit the translocation of cardiolipin to the outer membrane, and/or inhibit the
oxygenase/peroxidase activity. Thus, in some embodiments, the administered peptides
inhibit, delay or reduce the interaction between cardiolipin and cytochrome c. Additionally
or alternatively, in some embodiments, the administered peptides inhibit, delay or reduce
the formation of cytochrome c/cardiolipin complexes. Additionally or alternatively, in
some embodiments, the administered peptides inhibit, delay or reduce the
oxygenase/peroxidase activity of the cytochrome c/cardiolipin complexes. Additionally or
alternatively, in some embodiments, the administered peptides inhibit, delay or reduce
apoptosis.
         a.     Antiphospholipid Syndrome and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
[0122]     The peptides disclosed herein are useful in treating autoimmune diseases or
conditions, such as systemic autoimmune diseases. Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) and
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are examples of systemic autoimmune diseases that are
characterized by the presence of circulating autoantibodies including anticardiolipin
antibodies, anti-P2 glycoprotein I, and lupus anticoagulant. As with other autoimmune
diseases, the immune system attacks the body's cells and tissues, resulting in inflammation
and tissue damage. APS is associated with vascular thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, heart
valve disease, livedo reticularis, and/or pregnancy morbidity such as fetal death,
miscarriage, and pre-eclampsia. SLE may be a subset of APS that is characterized by
inflammatory reactions involving connective tissues. Inflammatory symptoms or conditions
in SLE include: fever; lung conditions such as pleuritis, pleural effusion, lupus pneumonitis,
chronic diffuse interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary emboli,
pulmonary hemorrhage, and shrinking lung syndrome; heart inflammation, including
pericarditis, myocarditis, and endocarditis; hematologic conditions such as anemia, low
platelet and white cell count; prolonged partial thromboplastin time; musculoskeletal issues
such as joint pain and inflammation, osteoarticular tuberculosis, and myalgia; dermatologic
conditions such as malar rash, discoid lupus, allopecia, mouth, nasal, urinary tract and
vaginal ulcers; neurological conditions such as headaches, depression, anxiety,
                                                45

  WO 2013/126775                                                            PCT/US2013/027430
polyneuropathy, psychosis, intracranial hypertension syndrome. The course of disease is
characterized by periods of acute flares alternating with remissions. There is currently no
specific treatment for APS or SLE, and available treatment usually only involves preventing
the acute flares and reducing their severity and duration when they occur.
[0123]     Cardiolipin oxidation may be an important process in the inflammatory aspects of
both APS and SLE. Accordingly, the aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure
(such as but not limited to 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH        2 (SS-02), Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys
NH 2 (SS-20) and D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH         2 (SS-31), Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH      2
(SS-19), where (atn)Dap is -anthraniloyl-L-a, -diaminopropionic acid, and 2',6'-Dmt-D
Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36), where Ald is j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, 2',6'
Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH        2 (SS-37), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, such
as acetate and trifluoroacetate salt) can be used to treat both of these diseases by preventing
cardiolipin oxidation, cellular apoptosis, and resultant inflammation via extracellular
exposure of cardiolipin to cardiolipin antibodies in a subject and/or the production of
cardiolipin antibodies in a subject.
                 1.      Cardiolipin oxidation and extracellular exposure on apoptotic cells
[0124]     The peptides disclosed herein are useful to prevent, inhibit or diminish cardiolipin
oxidation. Cardiolipin is a unique phospholipid that is almost exclusively found on the
inner mitochondrial membrane and at contact sites connecting the outer membrane and
inner membrane. Cardiolipin domains are required for proper cristae formation and they are
involved in the organization of respiratory complexes into higher-order supercomplexes to
facilitate electron transfer. Cardiolipin is also required to keep cytochrome c in close
proximity to the respiratory complexes for efficient electron transfer. The positively
charged cytochrome c interacts with the highly anionic cardiolipin via electrostatic
interactions.
[0125]     This cardiolipin-cytochrome c interaction is weakened by cardiolipin peroxidation,
and the loss of this free cytochrome c into the cytosol initiates caspase-dependent apoptosis
(Shidoji et al., 1999, Biochem Biophys Res Commun 264, 343-347). A remodeling of lipid
membranes occurs during apoptosis, and phosphatidylserine moves from the inner leaflet of
the plasma membrane to the outer leaflet. In a similar fashion, cardiolipin and its
metabolites can relocate from the mitochondria to other intracellular organelles and to the
                                                46

  WO 2013/126775                                                           PCT/US2013/027430
cell surface (M. Sorice et al., 2004, Cell Death Differ 11, 1133-1145). Thus, cardiolipin on
the surface of apoptotic cells may be the trigger for anti-cardiolipin antibodies.
                 2.     Cardiolipin oxidation and APS
[0126]     Cardiolipin has been shown to be expressed on the surface of apoptotic cells and
are recognized by antiphospholipid antibodies purified from patients with APS (M. Sorice et
al., 2004, Cell Death Differ 11, 1133-1145). In addition, the expression of cardiolipin
precedes the translocation of phosphatidylserine to the cell surface and DNA fragmentation.
Horkko et al. reported that anti-phospholipid antibodies only bind to oxidized cardiolipin,
and not reduced cardiolipin (Horkko et al., 1997, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 94:10356
 10361). This is consistent with the fact that cardiolipin must be oxidized to release
cytochrome c and relocate to the cell surface. Furthermore, reactive groups of oxidized
cardiolipin may form covalent adducts with 02GP 1, and these adducts may be epitopes for
anticardiolipin antibodies.
                 3.     Mitochondrial ATP depletion and SLE
[0127]     The peptides disclosed herein (such as but not limited to 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe
Lys-NH 2 (SS-02), Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-20) and D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH            2
(SS-31), Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is 0-anthraniloyl-L-a,P
diaminopropionic acid, and 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36), where Ald is 0-(6'
dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 (SS-37), or
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, such as acetate and trifluoroacetate salt) are
useful in to enhance ATP levels in dysfunctional mitochondria. Abnormal T-cell activation
and cell death are thought to underlie the pathology of SLE, and like APS, cardiolipin
peroxidation may contribute to this phenomenon. As in APS, anti-cardiolipin antibodies are
found in SLE patients (Woo et al., Korean J Lab Med. 2010 Feb;30(1):38-44).
Lymphocytes and PMNs from SLE patients exhibit elevated mitochondrial potential,
increased reactive oxygen species production, decreased intracellular ATP, increased lactate
levels, and reduced intracellular glutathione (Perl et al., 2004, Int Rev Immunol 23:293-313;
Perl et al., 2004, Trends Immunol 25, 360-367; Gergely, Jr. et al., 2002, Arthritis Rheum
46:175-190; Li et al., 2012, Clin Dev Immunol 2012, 548516). Thus, immune cells in SLE
patients are prone to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Consistent with this
                                                47

  WO 2013/126775                                                           PCT/US2013/027430
theory, SLE T cells exhibit enhanced spontaneous apoptosis (Perl et al., 2004, Trends
Immunol 25, 360-367).
[0128]    Lymphocyte necrosis may also contribute to the inflammatory reaction common in
SLE. Intracellular ATP concentration in lymphocytes is thought to be a key switch in the
cell's selection to die via apoptosis or necrosis. Deficiencies in intracellular ATP cause
lymphocytes to be more likely to die of necrosis, which may contribute to inflammation in
SLE patients. Thus, without wishing to be bound by theory, ATP deficiency in the
lymphocytes of SLE patients may predispose them to death by necrosis and lead to
increased inflammatory symptoms.
                4.       Preventing inflammation in APS or SLE using aromatic-cationic
                         peptides
[0129]    Aromatic-cationic peptides disclosed herein (such as but not limited to 2',6'-Dmt
D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-02), Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-20) and D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys
Phe-NH 2 (SS-31), Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH          2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is 0
anthraniloyl-L-a, -diaminopropionic acid, and 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36),
where Ald is j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald
NH 2 (SS-37), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, such as acetate and
trifluoroacetate salt), are useful to prevent cardiolipin peroxidation. Such peptides are also
useful to prevent inflammation in APS and SLE by preventing relocation of cardiolipin to
the cell surface, thus eliminating epitopes for the generation of cardiolipin antibodies,
preventing the reaction of cardiolipin with anti-cardiolipin antibodies, or by preventing ATP
depletion and resulting necrosis in lymphocytes. Cardiolipin peroxidation is primarily
mediated by the peroxidase activity of cytochrome c. About 15-20% of mitochondrial
cytochrome c is tightly bound in a complex with cardiolipin via hydrophobic interaction
whereby one or more acyl chains of cardiolipin is inserted into the hydrophobic channel of
cytochrome c. The insertion of the acyl chain into cytochrome c disrupts the coordinate
bond between Met8O and the heme Fe and exposes the sixth coordinate of heme Fe to H 2 0 2 ,
thus converting this enzyme into a peroxidase that can selectively catalyze the oxidation of
cardiolipin.
[0130]    The aromatic-cationic peptides disclosed herein, (such as but not limited to 2',6'
Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH        2 (SS-02), Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 (SS-20) and D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt
Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-31), Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH           2 (SS-19), where (atn)Dap is
                                                48

  WO 2013/126775                                                           PCT/US2013/027430
anthraniloyl-L-a, -diaminopropionic acid, and 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36),
where Ald is j-(6'-dimethylamino-2'-naphthoyl)alanine, 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald
NH 2 (SS-37), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, such as acetate and
trifluoroacetate salt), are cell-permeable and can selectively target and concentrate in the
inner mitochondrial membrane. The aromatic-cationic peptides selectively target anionic
phospholipids such as cardiolipin, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, and
phosphatidylglycerol, with cardiolipin having the highest affinity with some peptides (see
e.g., Example 21). In some embodiments, the aromatic-cationic peptides interact with
cytochrome c and the interaction is enhanced in the presence of cardiolipin. In some
embodiments, the peptides can penetrate within the cytochrome c protein in close proximity
of the heme, and this penetration is enhanced in the presence of cardiolipin (see e.g.,
Example 22-25).
[0131]    Without wishing to be bound by theory, by penetrating into the heme environment
of cytochrome c, it is likely that the aromatic-cationic peptides interfere with the structural
interaction between cardiolipin and cyt c, and prevent the rupture of the Met8O-Fe
coordinate and prevent cytochrome c from becoming a peroxidase (see e.g., Example 24).
These aromatic-cationic peptides also increase x-z* interaction in the heme region and
promote cytochrome c reduction.
[0132]    The aromatic-cationic peptides disclosed herein can also enhance mitochondrial
respiration, increase oxidative phosphorylation capacity, and reduce mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species (see e.g., Examples 16 and 20). As a result, they can protect lymphocyte
mitochondrial function, reduce cardiolipin peroxidation, inhibit apoptosis and necrosis, and
inhibit or reduce the exposure of cardiolipin to trigger antibody production and/or inhibit
contact between cardiolipin and cardiolipin antibodies.
[0133]    Determination of the BiologicalEffect of the Aromatic-CationicPeptide-Based
Therapeutic. In various embodiments, suitable in vitro or in vivo assays are performed to
determine the effect of a specific aromatic-cationic peptide-based therapeutic and whether
its administration is indicated for treatment. In various embodiments, in vitro assays can be
performed with representative animal models, to determine if a given aromatic-cationic
peptide-based therapeutic exerts the desired effect in preventing or treating disease.
Compounds for use in therapy can be tested in suitable animal model systems including, but

the art can be used prior to administration to human subjects.
[0134] ProphylacticMethods. In one aspect, the invention provides a method for
preventing, in a subject, disease by administering to the subject an aromatic-cationic peptide
that prevents the initiation or progression of the condition. In prophylactic applications,
pharmaceutical compositions or medicaments of aromatic-cationic peptides are
administered to a subject susceptible to, or otherwise at risk of a disease or condition in an
amount sufficient to eliminate or reduce the risk, lessen the severity, or delay the outset of
the disease, including biochemical, histologic and/or behavioral symptoms of the disease, its
complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of
the disease. Administration of a prophylactic aromatic-cationic can occur prior to the
manifestation of symptoms characteristic of the aberrancy, such that a disease or disorder is
prevented or, alternatively, delayed in its progression. The appropriate compound can be
determined based on screening assays described above.
[0135]    Therapeutic Methods. Another aspect of the technology includes methods of
treating disease in a subject for therapeutic purposes. In therapeutic applications,
compositions or medicaments are administered to a subject suspected of, or already
suffering from such a disease in an amount sufficient to cure, or at least partially arrest, the
symptoms of the disease, including its complications and intermediate pathological
phenotypes in development of the disease.
Modes of Administration and Effective Dosages
[0136]    Any method known to those in the art for contacting a cell, organ or tissue with a
peptide may be employed. Suitable methods include in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo methods.
In vivo methods typically include the administration of an aromatic-cationic peptide, such as
those described above, to a mammal, suitably a human. When used in vivo for therapy, the
aromatic-cationic peptides are administered to the subject in effective amounts (i.e.,
amounts that have desired therapeutic effect). The dose and dosage regimen will depend
upon the degree of the injury in the subject, the characteristics of the particular aromatic
cationic peptide used, e.g., its therapeutic index, the subject, and the subject's history.
[0137]    The effective amount may be determined during pre-clinical trials and clinical
trials by methods familiar to physicians and clinicians. An effective amount of a peptide

useful in the methods may be administered to a mammal in need thereof by any of a number
of well-known methods for administering pharmaceutical compounds. The peptide may be
administered systemically or locally.
[0138]     The peptide may be formulated as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term
"pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means a salt prepared from a base or an acid which is
acceptable for administration to a patient, such as a mammal (e.g., salts having acceptable
mammalian safety for a given dosage regime). However, it is understood that the salts are
not required to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as salts of intermediate
compounds that are not intended for administration to a patient. Pharmaceutically
acceptable salts can be derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases
and from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids. In addition, when a
peptide contains both a basic moiety, such as an amine, pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic
moiety such as a carboxylic acid or tetrazole, zwitterions may be formed and are included
within the term "salt" as used herein. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable
inorganic bases include ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium,
manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, and zinc salts, and the like. Salts derived from
pharmaceutically acceptable organic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary
amines, including substituted amines, cyclic amines, naturally-occurring amines and the
like, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine,
diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine,
ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine,
hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperadine,
polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine,
tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable
inorganic acids include salts of boric, carbonic, hydrohalic (hydrobromic, hydrochloric,
hydrofluoric or hydroiodic), nitric, phosphoric, sulfamic and sulfuric acids. Salts derived
from pharmaceutically acceptable organic acids include salts of aliphatic hydroxyl acids
(e.g., citric, gluconic, glycolic, lactic, lactobionic, malic, and tartaric acids), aliphatic
monocarboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, butyric, formic, propionic and trifluoroacetic acids),
amino acids (e.g., aspartic and glutamic acids), aromatic carboxylic acids (e.g., benzoic, p
chlorobenzoic, diphenylacetic, gentisic, hippuric, and triphenylacetic acids), aromatic
hydroxyl acids (e.g., o-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 1-hydroxynaphthalene-2
carboxylic and 3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acids), ascorbic, dicarboxylic acids

(e.g., fumaric, maleic, oxalic and succinic acids), glucoronic, mandelic, mucic, nicotinic,
orotic, pamoic, pantothenic, sulfonic acids (e.g., benzenesulfonic, camphosulfonic, edisylic,
ethanesulfonic, isethionic, methanesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, naphthalene- 1,5
disulfonic, naphthalene-2,6-disulfonic and p-toluenesulfonic acids), xinafoic acid, and the
like. In some embodiments, the salt is an acetate salt. Additionally or alternatively, in other
embodiments, the salt is a trifluoroacetate salt.
[0139]     The aromatic-cationic peptides described herein can be incorporated into
pharmaceutical compositions for administration, singly or in combination, to a subject for
the treatment or prevention of a disorder described herein. Such compositions typically
include the active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the term
"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes saline, solvents, dispersion media, coatings,
antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like,
compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Supplementary active compounds can also
be incorporated into the compositions.
[0140]     Pharmaceutical compositions are typically formulated to be compatible with its
intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral
(e.g., intravenous, intradermal, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous), oral, inhalation,
transdermal (topical), intraocular, iontophoretic, and transmucosal administration.
Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can
include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline
solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic
solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such
as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of
tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such
as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in
ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. For
convenience of the patient or treating physician, the dosing formulation can be provided in a
kit containing all necessary equipment (e.g., vials of drug, vials of diluent, syringes and
needles) for a treatment course (e.g., 7 days of treatment).
[0141]     Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use can include sterile aqueous
solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous
                                                52

  WO 2013/126775                                                           PCT/US2013/027430
preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration,
suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor ELTM (BASF,
Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, a composition for
parenteral administration must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy
syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and
must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and
fungi.
[0142]    The aromatic-cationic peptide compositions can include a carrier, which can be a
solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example,
glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable
mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a
coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of
dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be
achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens,
chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thiomerasol, and the like. Glutathione and other
antioxidants can be included to prevent oxidation. In many cases, it will be preferable to
include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or
sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions
can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for
example, aluminum monostearate or gelatin.
[0143]    Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound
in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients
enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are
prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle, which contains a basic
dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the
case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, typical methods of
preparation include vacuum drying and freeze drying, which can yield a powder of the
active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered
solution thereof.
[0144]    Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the
purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with
excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules. Oral
                                                53

  WO 2013/126775                                                          PCT/US2013/027430
compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash.
Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as
part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of
the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as
microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose,
a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as
magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening
agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl
salicylate, or orange flavoring.
[0145]    For administration by inhalation, the compounds can be delivered in the form of an
aerosol spray from a pressurized container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant,
e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. Such methods include those described in
U.S. Pat. No. 6,468,798.
[0146]     Systemic administration of a therapeutic compound as described herein can also be
by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration,
penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such
penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal
administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal
administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays. For transdermal
administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams
as generally known in the art. In one embodiment, transdermal administration may be
performed my iontophoresis.
[0147]    A therapeutic protein or peptide can be formulated in a carrier system. The carrier
can be a colloidal system. The colloidal system can be a liposome, a phospholipid bilayer
vehicle. In one embodiment, the therapeutic peptide is encapsulated in a liposome while
maintaining peptide integrity. As one skilled in the art would appreciate, there are a variety
of methods to prepare liposomes. (See Lichtenberg et al., Methods Biochem. Anal., 33:337
462 (1988); Anselem et al., Liposome Technology, CRC Press (1993)). Liposomal
formulations can delay clearance and increase cellular uptake (See Reddy, Ann.
Pharmacother.,34(7-8):915-923 (2000)). An active agent can also be loaded into a particle
prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients including, but not limited to,
soluble, insoluble, permeable, impermeable, biodegradable or gastroretentive polymers or
                                                54

liposomes. Such particles include, but are not limited to, nanoparticles, biodegradable
nanoparticles, microparticles, biodegradable microparticles, nanospheres, biodegradable
nanospheres, microspheres, biodegradable microspheres, capsules, emulsions, liposomes,
micelles and viral vector systems.
[0148]    The carrier can also be a polymer, e.g., a biodegradable, biocompatible polymer
matrix. In one embodiment, the therapeutic peptide can be embedded in the polymer
matrix, while maintaining protein integrity. The polymer may be natural, such as
polypeptides, proteins or polysaccharides, or synthetic, such as poly a-hydroxy acids.
Examples include carriers made of, e.g., collagen, fibronectin, elastin, cellulose acetate,
cellulose nitrate, polysaccharide, fibrin, gelatin, and combinations thereof. In one
embodiment, the polymer is poly-lactic acid (PLA) or copoly lactic/glycolic acid (PGLA).
The polymeric matrices can be prepared and isolated in a variety of forms and sizes,
including microspheres and nanospheres. Polymer formulations can lead to prolonged
duration of therapeutic effect. (See Reddy, Ann. Pharmacother.,34(7-8):915-923 (2000)).
A polymer formulation for human growth hormone (hGH) has been used in clinical trials.
(See Kozarich and Rich, Chemical Biology, 2:548-552 (1998)).
[0149]    Examples of polymer microsphere sustained release formulations are described in
PCT publication WO 99/15154 (Tracy et al.), U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,674,534 and 5,716,644 (both
to Zale et al.), PCT publication WO 96/40073 (Zale et al.), and PCT publication WO
00/38651 (Shah et al.). U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,674,534 and 5,716,644 and PCT publication WO
96/40073 describe a polymeric matrix containing particles of erythropoietin that are
stabilized against aggregation with a salt.
[0150]    In some embodiments, the therapeutic compounds are prepared with carriers that
will protect the therapeutic compounds against rapid elimination from the body, such as a
controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems.
Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate,
polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylacetic acid. Such
formulations can be prepared using known techniques. The materials can also be obtained
commercially, e.g., from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal
suspensions (including liposomes targeted to specific cells with monoclonal antibodies to
cell-specific antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can

  WO 2013/126775                                                          PCT/US2013/027430
be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as
described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811.
[0151]     The therapeutic compounds can also be formulated to enhance intracellular
delivery. For example, liposomal delivery systems are known in the art, see, e.g., Chonn
and Cullis, "Recent Advances in Liposome Drug Delivery Systems," Current Opinion in
Biotechnology 6:698-708 (1995); Weiner, "Liposomes for Protein Delivery: Selecting
Manufacture and Development Processes," Immunomethods, 4(3):201-9 (1994); and
Gregoriadis, "Engineering Liposomes for Drug Delivery: Progress and Problems," Trends
Biotechnol., 13(12):527-37 (1995). Mizguchi et al., Cancer Lett., 100:63-69 (1996),
describes the use of fusogenic liposomes to deliver a protein to cells both in vivo and in
vitro.
[0152]     Dosage, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the therapeutic agents can be
determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals,
e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the
dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and
therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50.
Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that
exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that
targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage
to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.
[0153]     The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in
formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies
preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or
no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form
employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods,
the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose
can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that
includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half
maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be
used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be
measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.

[0154]    Typically, an effective amount of the aromatic-cationic peptides, sufficient for
achieving a therapeutic or prophylactic effect, range from about 0.00000 1 mg per kilogram
body weight per day to about 10,000 mg per kilogram body weight per day. Suitably, the
dosage ranges are from about 0.000 1 mg per kilogram body weight per day to about 100 mg
per kilogram body weight per day. For example dosages can be 1 mg/kg body weight or 10
mg/kg body weight every day, every two days or every three days or within the range of 1
 10 mg/kg every week, every two weeks or every three weeks. In one embodiment, a single
dosage of peptide ranges from 0.1-10,000 micrograms per kg body weight. In one
embodiment, aromatic-cationic peptide concentrations in a carrier range from 0.2 to 2000
micrograms per delivered milliliter. An exemplary treatment regime entails administration
once per day or once a week. In therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at
relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or
terminated, and preferably until the subject shows partial or complete amelioration of
symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patient can be administered a prophylactic regime.
[0155]     In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of an aromatic-cationic
peptide may be defined as a concentration of peptide at the target tissue of 10-12 to 10-6
molar, e.g., approximately 10-7 molar. This concentration may be delivered by systemic
doses of 0.01 to 100 mg/kg or equivalent dose by body surface area. The schedule of doses
would be optimized to maintain the therapeutic concentration at the target tissue, most
preferably by single daily or weekly administration, but also including continuous
administration (e.g., parenteral infusion or transdermal application).
[0156]     In some embodiments, the dosage of the aromatic-cationic peptide is provided at
about 0.001 to about 0.5 mg/kg/h, suitably from about 0.01 to about 0.1 mg/kg/h. In one
embodiment, the is provided from about 0.1 to about 1.0 mg/kg/h, suitably from about 0.1
to about 0.5 mg/kg/h. In one embodiment, the dose is provided from about 0.5 to about 10
mg/kg/h, suitably from about 0.5 to about 2 mg/kg/h.
[0157]    The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage
and timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to, the severity of
the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and
other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective
amount of the therapeutic compositions described herein can include a single treatment or a
series of treatments.

Aromatic-cationic peptides in electron transfer
[0159]    Mitochondrial ATP synthesis is driven by electron flow through the electron
transport chain (ETC) of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Electron flow through
the chain can be described as a series of oxidation-reduction processes. Electrons pass from
electron donors (NADH or QH2), through a series of electron acceptors (Complexes I-IV),
and ultimately to the terminal electron acceptor, molecular oxygen. cytochrome c, which is
loosely associated with the IMM, transfers electrons between Complexes III and IV.
[0160]    Rapid shunting of electrons through the ETC is important for preventing short
circuiting that would lead to electron escape and generation of free radical intermediates.
The rate of electron transfer (ET) between an electron donor and electron acceptor decreases
exponentially with the distance between them, and superexchange ET is limited to 20A.
Long-range ET can be achieved in a multi-step electron hopping process, where the overall
distance between donor and acceptor is split into a series of shorter, and therefore faster, ET
steps. In the ETC, efficient ET over long distances is assisted by cofactors that are
strategically localized along the IMM, including FMN, FeS clusters, and hemes. Aromatic
amino acids such as Phe, Tyr and Trp can also facilitate electron transfer to heme through
overlapping r clouds, and this was specifically shown (see experimental examples) for
cytochrome c. Amino acids with suitable oxidation potential (Tyr, Trp, Cys, Met) can act as
stepping stones by serving as intermediate electron carriers. In addition, the hydroxyl group
of Tyr can lose a proton when it conveys an electron, and the presence of a basic group
nearby, such as Lys, can result in proton-coupled ET which is even more efficient.
[0161]    Overexpression of catalase targeted to mitochondria (mCAT) has been shown to
improve aging (e.g., reduce the symptoms) and prolong lifespan in mice. These examples
identify "druggable" chemical compounds that can reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress
and protect mitochondrial function. As mitochondria are the major source of intracellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS), the antioxidant must be delivered to mitochondria in order
to limit oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA, proteins of the electron transport chain
                                              58

  WO 2013/126775                                                          PCT/US2013/027430
(ETC), and the mitochondrial lipid membranes. We discovered a family of synthetic
aromatic-cationic tetrapeptides that selectively target and concentrate in the inner
mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Some of these peptides contain redox-active amino acids
that can undergo one-electron oxidation and behave as mitochondria-targeted antioxidants.
The peptides disclosed herein, such as the peptide D-Arg-2'6'-Dmt-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2
reduces mitochondrial ROS and protect mitochondrial function in cellular and animal
studies. Recent studies show that this peptide can confer protection against mitochondrial
oxidative stress comparable to that observed with mitochondrial catalase overexpression.
Although radical scavenging is the most commonly used approach to reduce oxidative
stress, there are other potential mechanisms that can be used, including facilitation of
electron transfer to reduce electron leak and improved mitochondrial reduction potential.
[0162]    Abundant circumstantial evidence indicates that oxidative stress contributes to
many consequences of normal aging and several major diseases, including cardiovascular
diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Oxidative stress is generally
defined as an imbalance of prooxidants and antioxidants. However, despite a wealth of
scientific evidence to support increased oxidative tissue damage, large-scale clinical studies
with antioxidants have not demonstrated significant health benefits in these diseases. One
of the reasons may be due to the inability of the available antioxidants to reach the site of
prooxidant production.
[0163]    The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) is the primary intracellular
producer of ROS, and mitochondria themselves are most vulnerable to oxidative stress.
Protecting mitochondrial function would therefore be a prerequisite to preventing cell death
caused by mitochondrial oxidative stress. The benefits of overexpressing catalase targeted
to mitochondria (mCAT), but not peroxisomes (pCAT), provided proof-of-concept that
mitochondria-targeted antioxidants would be necessary to overcome the detrimental effects
of aging. However, adequate delivery of chemical antioxidants to the IMM remains a
challenge.
[0164]     One peptide analog, D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 , possesses intrinsic
antioxidant ability because the modified tyrosine residue is redox-active and can undergo
one-electron oxidation. We have shown that this peptide can neutralize H 2 0 2 , hydroxyl

[0165]    The design of the mitochondria-targeted peptides incorporates and enhances one or
more of the following modes of action: (i) scavenging excess ROS, (ii) reducing ROS
production by facilitating electron transfer, or (iii) increasing mitochondrial reductive
capacity. The advantage of peptide molecules is that it is possible to incorporate natural or
unnatural amino acids that can serve as redox centers, facilitate electron transfer, or increase
sulfydryl groups while retaining the aromatic-cationic motif required for mitochondria
targeting.
                                         EXAMPLES
[0166]    The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which
should not be construed as limiting in any way.
General Methods
[0167]     Cytochrome c reduction: Increasing amounts of aromatic-cationic peptides were
added to a solution of oxidized cytochrome c. The formation of reduced cytochrome c was
monitored by absorbance at 500 nm. The rate of cytochrome c reduction was determined by
non-linear analysis (Prizm software).
[0168]    Time-resolved UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy was used to study the electron
transport process of cytochrome c in the presence of peptides. Reduced cytochrome c was
monitored by absorbance at a broad-band spectral range (200- 1100 nm). The absorption
changes were recorded with a UV/Visible spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 3300 pro, GE) in
quartz cells with path lengths of 1 or 2 mm. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and glutathione were
used as electron donors to reduce oxidized cytochrome c. The rate constant of cytochrome
c reduction was estimated by adding various concentrations of peptides. The dose
dependence of the peptides was correlated to the cytochrome c reduction kinetics.
[0169]    Mitochondrial02 consumption and A TPproduction: Fresh mitochondria were
isolated from rat kidney as described previously. Electron flux was measured by 02
consumption (Oxygraph Clark electrode) as previously described using different substrates
for C1 (glutamate/malate), C2 (succinate), and C3 (TMPD/ascorbate). Assays were carried
out under low substrate conditions in order to avoid saturating the enzyme reactions. ATP
                                                60

  WO 2013/126775                                                          PCT/US2013/027430
production in isolated mitochondria was determined kinetically using the luciferase method
(Biotherma) in a 96-well luminescence plate reader (Molecular Devices). The initial
maximal rate for ATP synthesis was determined over the first minute.
[0170]    Cyclic voltammetry: Cyclic voltammetry was performed using the Bioanalytical
System CV-50W Voltammetric Analyzer using an Ag/AgCl/1 M KCl reference electrode
with a potential of +0.237 V versus NHE (Biometra, G6ttingen, Germany), and a platinum
counter electrode. Gold wire electrodes were cleaned following an established protocols.
Electrochemical studies of cytochrome c in solution were performed using
mercaptopropanol-modified electrodes (incubation 24 h in 20 mM mercaptopropanol).
Cyclic voltammograms with 20 gM cytochrome c in 1 M KCl and 10 mM sodium
phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 /7.8 were recorded. The formal potential was calculated as the
midpoint between the anodic and cathodic peak potentials at different scan rates (100-400
mV/s) and diffusion coefficients from the peak currents at different scan rates according the
Randles-Sevcik equation.
Example 1. Synthesis of Aromatic-Cationic Peptides.
[0171]    Solid-phase peptide synthesis is used and all amino acids derivatives are
commercially available. After completion of peptide assembly, peptides are cleaved from
the resin in the usual manner. Crude peptides are purified by preparative reversed-phase
chromatography. The structural identity of the peptides is confirmed by FAB mass
spectrometry and their purity is assessed by analytical reversed-phase HPLC and by thin
layer chromatography in three different systems. Purity of >98% will be achieved.
Typically, a synthetic run using 5 g of resin yields about 2.0-2.3 g of pure peptides.
Example 2. The peptide D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) facilitates cytochrome c
reduction.
[0172]    Absorption spectroscopy (UltroSpec 3300 Pro; 220-1100 nm) was used to
determine if SS-31 modulates cytochrome c reduction (FIG. 1). Reduction of cytochrome c
with glutathione is associated with multiple shifts in the Q band (450-650 nm), with a
prominent shift at 550 nm. Addition of SS-31 produced significant spectral weight shift at
550 nm (FIG. 1A). Time-dependent spectroscopy show that SS-31 increased the rate of
cytochrome c reduction (FIG. IB). These data suggest that SS-31 altered the electronic
structure of cytochrome c and enhanced the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ heme. Accordingly,
the aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are useful for altering the structure
                                               61

  WO 2013/126775                                                          PCT/US2013/027430
and oxidation state of cytochrome c, and are useful for the prevention or treatment of
diseases or disorders characterized by dysregulation of cytochrome c.
Example 3. The peptide D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) enhances electron diffusion
through cytochrome c.
[0173]    Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to determine if SS-31 altered electron
flow and/or reduction/oxidation potentials of cytochrome c (FIG. 2, upper panel). CV was
done using an Au working electrode, Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and Pt auxiliary
electrode. SS-31 increased current for both reduction and oxidation processes of
cytochrome c (FIG. 2, upper panel). SS-31 does not alter reduction/oxidation potentials
(FIG. 2, upper panel), but rather increases electron flow through cytochrome c, suggesting
that SS-31 decreases resistance between complexes III to IV. For FIG 2 (lower panel) all
voltammetric measurements were performed using the BASi-50W Voltammetric Analyzer
coupled to a BASi C3 Cell Stand. An Ag/AgCl electrode was used as reference and glassy
carbon and platinum electrodes were use for standard measurements. Prior to each
measurement solutions were fully de-gassed with nitrogen to avoid electrode fouling.
Cyclic voltammograms were taken for Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer, buffer plus
cytochrome c, and buffer plus cytochrome c plus two different SS-31 doses as shown in FIG
2 (lower panel). The current (electron diffusion rate) increases almost 200%, as the SS-31
dose is doubled with respect to cytochrome c (cytochrome c:SS-31=1:2). The result
indicates that SS-31 promotes the electron diffusion in cytochrome c. Thus, the aromatic
cationic peptides of the present disclosure are useful for the prevention or treatment of
diseases or disorders characterized by dysregulation of cytochrome c, for enhancing
electron diffusion through cytochrome c, and for designing more sensitive bio-detectors.
Example 4. The peptide D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) enhances electron capacity
in cytochrome c.
[0174]    Photoluminescence (PL) was carried out to examine the effects of SS-31 on the
electronic structure of conduction band of the heme of cytochrome c, an energy state
responsible for electronic transport (FIG. 3). A Nd:YDO4 laser (532.8 nm) was used to
excite electrons in cytochrome c (FIG. 3A). Strong PL emission in cytochrome c state can
be clearly identified at 650 nm (FIG. 3B). The PL intensity increased dose-dependently
with the addition of SS-31, implying an increase of available electronic states in conduction
band in cytochrome c (FIG. 3B). This suggests that SS-31 increases electron capacity of
conduction band of cytochrome c, concurring with SS-3 1-mediated increase in current
                                               62

  WO 2013/126775                                                          PCT/US2013/027430
through cytochrome c. Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are
useful for the prevention or treatment of diseases or disorders characterized by
dysregulation of cytochrome c, for enhancing electron capacity in cytochrome c, and for
treatment of diseases or disorders characterized by dysregulation of electron capacity in
cytochrome c.
Example 5. The peptide D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) induces novel 7E-7E
interactions around cytochrome c heme.
[0175]    Circular dichroism (Olis spectropolarimeter, DSM20) was carried out to monitor
Soret band (negative peak at 415 nm), as a probe for the   7-n* heme environment in
cytochrome c (FIG. 4). SS-31 promoted a "red" shift of this peak to 440 nm, suggesting that
SS-31 induced a novel heme-tyrosine     7-n* transition within cytochrome c, without
denaturing (FIG. 4). These results suggest that SS-31 must modify the immediate
environment of the heme, either by providing an additional Tyr for electron tunneling to the
heme, or by reducing the distance between endogenous Tyr residues and the heme. The
increase in 7 - n* interaction around the heme would enhance electron tunneling which
would be favorable for electron diffusion. Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the
present disclosure are useful for the prevention or treatment of diseases or disorders
characterized by dysregulation of cytochrome c, and to induce novel 7t-7t interactions around
cytochrome c heme.
Example 6. The peptide D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) increases mitochondrial 02
consumption.
[0176]    Oxygen consumption of isolated rat kidney mitochondria was determined using the
Oxygraph (FIG. 5). Rates of respiration were measured in the presence of different
concentrations of SS-31 in state 2 (400 iM ADP only), state 3 (400 iM ADP and 500 iM
substrates) and state 4 (substrates only). All experiments were done in triplicate with n = 4
7. The results show that SS-31 promoted electron transfer to oxygen without uncoupling
mitochondria (FIG. 5). Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure
are useful for promoting electron transfer to oxygen without uncoupling mitochondria,
increasing 02 consumption, and treating diseases or conditions related to dysregulation of
02  consumption in mitochondria.
                                               63

  WO 2013/126775                                                          PCT/US2013/027430
Example 7. The peptide D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-31) increases ATP synthesis in
isolated mitochondria.
[0177]    The rate of mitochondrial ATP synthesis was determined by measuring ATP in
respiration buffer collected from isolated mitochondria 1 min after addition of 400 mM
ADP (FIG. 6). ATP was assayed by HPLC. All experiments were carried out in triplicate,
with n=3. Addition of SS-31 to isolated mitochondria dose-dependently increased the rate
of ATP synthesis (FIG. 6). These results show that the enhancement of electron transfer by
SS-31 is coupled to ATP synthesis. Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present
disclosure are useful for increasing ATP synthesis in mitochondria and for treating diseases
or disorder characterized by dysregulation of ATP synthesis.
Example 8. The peptide D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-31) enhances respiration in
cytochrome c-depleted mitoplasts.
[0178]    To demonstrate the role of cytochrome c in the action of SS-31 on mitochondrial
respiration, the effect of SS-31 on mitochondrial 02 consumption was determined in
cytochrome c-depleted mitoplasts made from once-frozen rat kidney mitochondria (FIG. 7).
Rates of respiration were measured in the presence of 500 piM Succinate with or without
 100 iM SS-31. The experiment was carried out in triplicate, with n=3. These data suggest
that: 1) SS-31 works via IMM-tightly bound cytochrome c; 2) SS-31 can rescue a decline in
functional cytochrome c. Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure
are useful for the prevention or treatment of diseases or disorders characterized by
dysregulation of cytochrome c.
Example 9. The peptides D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) and Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys
NH 2 (SS-20) facilitate cytochrome c reduction.
[0179]    SS-31 and SS-20 can accelerate the kinetics of cytochrome c reduction induced by
glutathione (GSH) as a reducing agent (FIG. 8). Reduction of cytochrome c was monitored
by increase in absorbance at 550 nm. Addition of GSH resulted in a time-dependent
increase in absorbance at 550 nm (FIG. 8). Similar results were obtained using N
acetylcysteine (NAC) as a reducing agent (not shown). The addition of SS-31 alone at 100
gM concentrations did not reduce cytochrome c, but SS-31 dose-dependently increased the
rate of NAC-induced cytochrome c reduction, suggesting that SS-31 does not donate an
electron, but can speed up electron transfer. Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the
present disclosure are useful for the prevention or treatment of diseases or disorders
                                               64

  WO 2013/126775                                                         PCT/US2013/027430
characterized by dysregulation of cytochrome c and are useful for facilitating cytochrome c
reduction.
Example 10. The peptides D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-31) and Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys
NH2 (SS-20) increase mitochondrial electron flux and ATP synthesis.
[0180]    Both SS-20 and SS-31 can promote electron flux, as measured by 02 consumption
in isolated rat kidney mitochondria (FIG. 9). SS-20 or SS-31 was added at 100 gM
concentrations to isolated mitochondria in respiration buffer containing 0.5 mM succinate
(complex II substrate) and 400 gM ADP. Similar increases in 02 consumption were
observed when low concentrations of complex I substrates (glutamate/malate) were used
(data not shown). The increase in electron flux was correlated with a significant increase in
the rate of ATP production in isolated mitochondria energized with low concentrations of
succinate (FIG. 10). Accordingly, targeting SS-20 and SS-31 to the IMM can facilitate
electron flux in the electron transport chain and improve ATP synthesis, especially under
conditions of reduced substrate supply.
Example 11. Cytochrome c isolation and purification
[0181]    Methods to isolate and purify cytochrome c are known in the art. One exemplary,
non-limiting method is provided. Cytochrome c has several positively charged groups,
giving it a pI of around 10. Thus, it is normally bound to the membrane of mitochondria by
ionic attraction to the negative charges of the phospholipids on the membrane. The tissue
and mitochondria are first broken up by homogenization in a blender at low pH, in an
aluminum sulfate solution. The positively charged aluminum ions can displace the
cytochrome c from the membrane by binding to the negatively charged phospholipids and
free the protein in solution. Excess aluminum sulfate is removed by raising the pH to 8.0,
where the aluminum precipitates in the form of aluminum hydroxide.
[0182]    After filtration to eliminate the precipitated aluminum hydroxide, ion-exchange
chromatography is used to separate proteins as a function of their charge. Cytochrome c has
several positively charged groups; typically, the column is made out of Amberlite CG-50, a
negatively charged or cation-exchange resin.
[0183]    Once the eluent has been collected, ammonium sulfate precipitation is used to
selectively precipitate the remaining contaminant proteins in the cytochrome c preparation.
Most proteins precipitate at 80% saturation in ammonium sulfate, whereas cytochrome c
                                                 65

  WO 2013/126775                                                           PCT/US2013/027430
remains soluble. The excess of salts present in the solution are then removed by gel
filtration chromatography which separates protein on the basis of their size.
[0184]     To assess the purification, samples of the preparation are collected at each step of
the purification. These samples are then assayed for total protein content using the Bradford
method, and their cytochrome c concentration is measure by spectrophotometry.
Example 12. The peptides 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH2 (SS-19), 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg
Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 (SS-37), and Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36) interact with
hydrophobic domain of cardiolipin (CL).
[0185]     The peptides 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-(atn)Dap-Lys-NH 2 (SS-19) and 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg
Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 (SS-37) cationic peptides carry net positive charge at neutral pH. They
are expected to associate with anionic phospholipid cardiolipin based on electrostatic
interaction. The interaction of small peptides with lipid membranes can been studied using
fluorescence spectroscopy (Surewicz and Epand, 1984). The fluorescence of intrinsic Trp
residues exhibits increased quantal yield upon binding to phospholipid vesicles, and this
was also accompanied by a blue shift of the maximum emission indicative of the
incorporation of the Trp residue in a more hydrophobic environment. Polarity-sensitive
fluorescent probes were incorporated into the peptides and fluorescence spectroscopy was
used to determine if SS-19, SS-37 and SS-36 interact with CL. Results are shown in FIG.
 11.
[0186]     The peptide 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19) contains anthraniloyl
incorporated into diaminopropionic acid. Anthraniloyl derivatives fluoresce in the 410-420
nm range when excited at 320-330 nm (Hiratsuka T, 1983). The quantum yield of
anthraniloyl derivatives is strongly dependent on the local environment, and can increase 5
fold going from water to 80% ethanol, together with a blue shift in the emission maxima (k
max) of <10 nm (Hiratsuka T, 1983). Fluorescence emission spectrum of SS-19 (1 gM)
alone, and in the presence of increasing concentrations of CL (5 to 50 gg/ml), was
monitored following excitation at 320 nm using Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence
spectrophotometer. Addition of CL (5-50 gg/ml) led to 2-fold increase in quantal yield of
SS-19 with no significant shift in Xmax (FIG. 11 A). These findings suggest that SS-19
interacts with the hydrophobic domain of CL.
[0187]     The peptide 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH       2 (SS-37) contains an additional
amino acid, aladan (Ald), which has been reported to be particularly sensitive to the polarity
                                               66

  WO 2013/126775                                                         PCT/US2013/027430
of its environment and it has been used to probe the electrostatic character of proteins
(Cohen et al., 2002). When excited at 350 nm, Xmax shifts from 542 nm in water to 409 nm
in heptane, accompanied by a significant increase in quantal yield (Cohen et al., 2001).
Fluorescence emission spectrum of SS-37 (1 gM) alone, and in the presence of increasing
concentrations of CL, was monitored following excitation at 350 nm. Addition of CL (5 to
50 gg/ml) led to a 3-fold increase in quantal yield of SS-37 as well as a clear blue shift in k
max, from 525 nm without CL to 500 nm with 50 gg/ml CL (FIG. 1IB). These results
provide evidence that SS-37 interact with hydrophobic domain of CL.
[0188]    The peptide 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36) contains Ald in place Phe 3 in
SS-02. Fluorescence emission spectrum of SS-36 (1 gM) alone, and in the presence of
increasing concentrations of CL, was monitored following excitation at 350 nm. SS-36 was
the most sensitive to the addition of CL, with dramatic increase in quantal yield and blue
shift observed with much lower added amounts of CL (1.25 to 5 gg/ml). The Xmax shifted
from 525 nm without CL to 500 nm with as little as 1.25 gg/ml CL, and quantal yield
increased by more than 100-fold with the addition of 5 gg/ml of CL (FIG. 1IC). These
results provide evidence that SS-36 interacts strongly with the hydrophobic domain of CL.
Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are useful for the
prevention or treatment of diseases or disorders characterized by dysregulation of
cardiolipin.
Example 13. Interaction of the peptide 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19) with
cytochrome c.
[0189]    Fluorescence quenching was used to demonstrate the interaction of the peptide
Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19) with cytochrome c. Maximal fluorescence
emission of SS-19 was monitored at 420 nm following excitation at 320 nm using Hitachi
F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Results are shown in FIG. 12.
[0190]    SS-19 fluorescence (10 gM) was quenched by sequential addition of 0.2 mg
isolated rat renal kidney mitochondria (FIG. 12A, M + arrows), suggesting uptake of SS-19
by mitochondria. Quenching of SS-19 was significantly reduced when cytochrome c
depleted mitoplasts (0.4 mg) were added, suggesting that cytochrome c plays a major role in
the quenching of SS-19 by mitochondria (FIG. 12B). SS-19 fluorescence (10 gM) was
similarly quenched by sequential addition of 2 gM cytochrome c (FIG. 12C, C + arrows).
The quenching by cytochrome c was not displaced by sequential additions of bovine serum
                                              67

  WO 2013/126775                                                             PCT/US2013/027430
albumin (FIG. 12C, A + arrows) (500 gg/ml). These data indicate that SS-19 is likely to
interact very deep in the interior of cytochrome c in the heme environment. The interaction
of SS-19 with cytochrome c is linearly dependent on the amount of cytochrome c added
(FIG. 12D). Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are useful for
the prevention or treatment of diseases or disorders characterized by dysregulation of
cytochrome c.
Example 14. The peptides 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS- 19), 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg
Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 (SS-37) and 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36) interact with
cytochrome c and CL.
[0191]    Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to demonstrate the interaction of the peptides
2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH        2 (SS-19), 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-Ald-NH 2 (SS-37),
and 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2 (SS-36) interact with cytochrome c in the presence of
CL. Results are shown in FIG. 13
[0192]    Fluorescence emission of SS-19 (10 gM) was monitored in real time
(Ex/Em=320nm/420 nm) using Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Addition
of cytochrome c (2 gM) led to immediate quenching of the fluorescence signal (FIG. 13A)
[0193]    Fluorescence emission of SS-19 (10 gM) was monitored in real time
(Ex/Em=320nm/420 nm) using Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Addition
of CL (50 gg/ml) led to increase in SS-19 fluorescence. Subsequent addition of cytochrome
c (2 gM) led to larger extent of quenching of SS-19 fluorescence compared to addition of
cytochrome c without CL (FIG. 13B). These data indicate that the interaction of SS-19 with
cytochrome c is enhanced in the presence of CL. CL may potentiate the interaction between
SS-19 and cytochrome c by serving as an anionic platform for the two cationic molecules.
[0194]    SS-37 fluorescence (10 gM) was similarly quenched by sequential addition of 2
gM cytochrome c in the presence of CL (50 gg/ml) (FIG. 13C, C + arrows). The quenching
by cytochrome c was not displaced by sequential additions of bovine serum albumin (500
gg/ml) (FIG. 13C, A + arrows). Thus interaction of these peptides with CL does not
interfere with their ability to interact very deep in the interior of cytochrome c.
[0195]    SS-36 also contains the polarity-sensitive fluorescent amino acid aladan. Addition
of CL (2.5 gg/ml) led to increase in SS-36 fluorescence (FIG. 13D). After subsequent
addition of cytochrome c(2 gM) the emission spectrum of SS-36 shows dramatic quenching
                                                 68

  WO 2013/126775                                                           PCT/US2013/027430
of peptide's fluorescence with large blue shift of the emission maxima (510 nm to 450 nm)
(FIG. 13D). These data suggest that the peptide is interacting with a hydrophobic domain
deep in the interior of cytochrome c-CL complex. Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides
of the present disclosure are useful for the prevention or treatment of diseases or disorders
characterized by dysregulation of cardiolipin and/or cytochrome c, and/or diseases or
disorders characterized by dysregulation of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction.
Example 15. The peptides 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-(atn)Dap-NH 2 (SS-19), Phe-D-Arg-Phe
Lys-NH 2 (SS-20), D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-31), 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Ald-Lys-NH 2
(SS-36) and D-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SPI-231) protect the heme environment of
cytochrome c from the acyl chain of CL.
[0196]    Circular dichroism (CD) was carried out to examine the effects of the peptides on
protecting the heme environment of cytochrome c from the acyl chain of CL. For heme
proteins, the Soret CD spectrum is strictly correlated with the heme pocket conformation. In
particular, the negative 416-420 nm Cotton effect is considered diagnostic of Fe(III)-Met8O
coordination in native cytochrome c (Santucci and Ascoli, 1997). Loss of the Cotton effect
reveals alterations of the heme pocket region which involve the displacement of Met8O from
the axial coordination to the heme iron. CD spectra were obtained using AVIV CD
Spectrometer Model 410. Results are shown in FIG. 14.
[0197]    Changes in the Soret CD spectrum of cytochrome c (10 gM) were recorded in the
absence (dotted line) and presence (dashed line) of 30 gg/ml CL, plus addition of different
peptides (10 gM) (solid line) (FIG. 14). CD measurements were carried out using 20 mM
HEPES, pH 7.5, at 25 0 C and expressed as molar ellipticity (0) (m Deg). The addition of CL
resulted in the disappearance of the negative Cotton effect, and this was completely
prevented by the addition of these peptides. These results provide clear evidence that the
peptides interact with the heme pocket of cytochrome c and protect the Fe-Met8O
coordination. Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are useful
for the prevention or treatment of diseases or disorders characterized by dysregulation of
cardiolipin and/or cytochrome c, and/or diseases or disorders characterized by dysregulation
of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction.    In addition, aromatic-cationic peptides of the
present disclosure are useful to protect the heme environment of cytochrome c from the acyl
chain of cardiolipin.

Example 16. The peptides D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-31), Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys
NH2 (SS-20), and D-Arg-Tyr-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SPI-231) prevent the inhibition of cytochrome
c reduction caused by CL.
[0198]    Cytochrome c is a carrier of electrons between respiratory complex III and IV in
mitochondria. Cytochrome c is reduced (Fe2 ) after it accepts an electron from cytochrome
c reductase, and it is then oxidized to Fe3 by cytochrome c oxidase. The CL associated
cytochrome c has a redox potential which is significantly more negative than native
cytochrome c, and the reduction of cytochrome c is significantly inhibited in the presence of
CL (Basova et al., 2007).
[0199]    Reduction of cytochrome c (20 gM) was induced by the addition of glutathione
(500 gM) in the absence or presence of CL (100 gg/ml) (FIG. 15A). Reduction of
cytochrome c was monitored by absorbance at 550 nm using a 96-well UV-VIS plate reader
(Molecular Devices). Addition of CL decreased the rate of cytochrome c reduction by half.
Addition of SS-31 (20, 40 or 100 gM) dose-dependently prevented the inhibitory action of
CL (FIG. 15A).
[0200]    SS-31 dose-dependently overcame the inhibitory effect of CL on kinetics of
cytochrome c reduction induced by 500 gM GSH or 50 gM ascorbate (FIG. 15B). SS-20
and SP-231 also prevented CL inhibition of cytochrome c reduction elicited by 500 gM
GSH (FIG. 15C). Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are
useful for the prevention or treatment of diseases or disorders characterized by
dysregulation of cardiolipin and/or cytochrome c, and/or diseases or disorders characterized
by dysregulation of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction. In addition, aromatic-cationic
peptides of the present disclosure are useful to prevent the inhibition of cytochrome c
reduction caused by cardiolipin.
Example 17. The pep tides D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) and Phe-D-Arg-Phe
Lys-NH 2 (SS-20) enhances 02 consumption in isolated mitochondria.
[0201]    Both SS-20 and SS-31 can promote electron flux, as measured by 02 consumption
in isolated rat kidney mitochondria. SS-20 or SS-31 was added at 10 gM or 100 gM
concentrations to isolated mitochondria in respiration buffer containing glutamate/malate
(complex I substrate), 0.5 mM succinate (complex II substrate) or 3 gM TMPD/1 mM
ascorbate (direct reductant of cytochrome c). 400 gM ADP was added to initiate State 3
respiration. Results are shown in FIG. 16.

  WO 2013/126775                                                           PCT/US2013/027430
[0202]    SS-31 increased 02 consumption in state 3 respiration with either complex I or
complex II substrates, or when cytochrome c is directly reduced by TMPD/ascorbate (FIG.
 16A). SS-20 also increases 02 consumption in state 3 respiration when these substrates
were used (FIG. 16B; data with glutamate/malate and TMPD/ascorbate not shown).
[0203]    These data suggest that SS-31 increases electron flux in the electron transport
chain, and that the site of action is between cytochrome c and complex IV (cytochrome c
oxidase). Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are useful for
promoting electron transfer to oxygen without uncoupling mitochondria, increasing 02
consumption, and treating diseases or conditions related to dysregulation of 02 consumption
in mitochondria.
Example 18. The peptide D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) increases ATP synthesis
in isolated mitochondria.
[0204]    Increase in electron flux in the electron transport chain can either result in increase
in ATP synthesis or increase in electron leak and generation of free radicals. ATP synthesis
in isolated mitochondria was assayed by HPLC. SS-31 dose-dependently increased ATP
synthesis, suggesting that the increase in electron flux is coupled to oxidative
phosphorylation (FIG. 17). Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present
disclosure are useful for increasing ATP synthesis in mitochondria and for treating diseases
or disorder characterized by dysregulation of ATP synthesis.
Example 19. The peptide D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) enhances respiration in
cytochrome c -depleted mitoplasts.
[0205]    A model of cytochrome c tightly bound to mitochondrial cardiolipin was used to
investigate interaction of SS-31 with cytochrome c-CL complex in mitochondria. After
removal of outer membrane with digitonin, mitoplasts were washed with 120 mM KCl to
remove all free and electrostatically associated cytochrome c, leaving only cytochrome c
tightly bound to CL. D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) enhances complex II respiration in
mitoplasts with cytochrome c tightly bound to inner mitochondrial membrane in a dose
dependent manner (FIG. 18). These data suggests that SS-31 directly interacts with
cytochrome c -CL complex and promotes electron transfer from complex III to complex IV.

Example 20. The peptide D-Arg-2',6'-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 (SS-3 1) prevents CL from
switching cytochrome c from an electron carrier into a peroxidase activity.
[0206]     The six coordination of the heme in cytochrome c prevents direct interaction of
H 2 0 2 with the catalytic metal site, and native cytochrome c in solution is a poor peroxidase.
Upon interaction with CL, cytochrome c undergoes a structural change with rupture of the
Fe-Met8O coordination. This results in the exposure of the heme Fe3 to H 2 0 2 , and
peroxidase activity increases dramatically (Vladimirov et al., 2006; Sinibaldi et al., 2008).
The mechanism of action of cytochrome c peroxidase is similar to that of other peroxidases,
such as horse radish peroxidase (HRP). Thus it is possible to use the amplex red-HRP
reaction to investigate cytochrome c peroxidase activity. In the presence of peroxidase,
amplex red (AR) reacts with H 2 0 2 to form the red-fluorescent oxidation product, resorufin
(Ex/Em    = 571/585).
[0207]     Cytochrome c (2 gM) was mixed with CL (25 gg/ml) and 10 gM H 2 0 2 in 20 mM
HEPES, pH 7.4. Amplex red (50 gM) was then added and fluorescence emission monitored
in real time using Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Addition of amplex red
elicited rapid increase in fluorescence signal due to resorufin formation, providing direct
evidence for peroxidase activity of cytochrome c /CL complex (FIG. 19A). Inclusion of SS
31 decreased the rate of amplex red peroxidation, suggesting that SS-31 interacts directly
with cytochrome c to prevent CL-induced peroxidase activity (FIG. 19A).
[0208]     Addition of SS-31 dose-dependently reduced the kinetics of cytochrome c
peroxidase activity (FIG. 19B) but had no effect on HRP activity (data not shown). FIG.
 19C shows a comparison of various peptides on their ability to inhibit cytochrome c
peroxidase activity at a fixed concentration of 10 gM. Accordingly, aromatic-cationic
peptides of the present disclosure are useful for the prevention or treatment of diseases or
disorders characterized by dysregulation of cardiolipin and/or cytochrome c, and/or diseases
or disorders characterized by dysregulation of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction. In
addition, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are useful for inhibiting
peroxidase activity in cytochrome c.
Example 21. The peptide analog SS-02 interacts with cardiolipin and liposomes that
contain cardiolipin.
[0209]     Fluorophore-labeled SS-02 was used to investigate the interaction of SS-02 with
the phospholipid cardiolipin, as well as other phospholipids. The fluorophores

anthraniloyl (atn; Xex  = 320 nm) and aladan (ald; Xex  = 360 nm) were incorporated within
the peptide structure of SS-02, as shown in FIG. 20A. The resulting peptides are termed
"[atn]SS-02" or "SS-19" and "[ald]SS-02" or "SS-36," respectively. The structure of SS-31
is also shown for comparison. Each of the fluorophores are known to show enhanced
fluorescence emission in hydrophobic environment. In addition, ald is a dielectric-sensitive
probe that produces progressive blue shift in its emission maxima (Xmax) as the polarity of
its environment decreases. Both the atn and ald fluorophores are also very small so they do
not substantially alter the physicochemical properties of the tetrapeptide (P. W. Schiller et
al., 2005, J Pept Res 65, 556-563).
        Materials and Methods
[0210]     1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl
sn-glycero-3 -phosphate (POPA), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine
(POPS), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PE), and 1,2
dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(l'-rac-glycerol) (DPPG) were obtained from Avanti
Polar Lipids Inc (Alabaster, AL).
[0211]    Liposomes were prepared using individual phospholipids POPC and cardiolipin
(CL) mixed in a 1:1 ratio and dried under nitrogen. The lipids were then mixed in 20 mM
Hepes (pH 7.4) by vortexing, and then sonicated five times for 30 seconds on ice using an
ultrasonic probe tip sonicator (Cole-Palmer Ultrasonic Homogenizer, 20 kHz, Cole-Parmer
Instrument Company, Vernon Hills, IL). Liposomes were used immediately after
preparation.
[0212]    Changes in the emission intensity of the [atn]SS-02 and the [ald]SS-02 were
measured using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The different solvents
used to dissolve the various phospholipids (chloroform, methanol and ethanol) had
negligible effect on the fluorescence spectrum of [atn]SS-02 and [ald]SS-02. All
experiments were done in low ionic solution (deionized water) to optimize electrostatic
interactions of peptides with phospholipids.
        Results
[0213]    Increasing concentrations of cardiolipin (5, 10, 25, and 50 gg/mL) were added to 1
gM [atn]SS-02, and the emission intensity between 350 nm and 500 nm was measured. The

  WO 2013/126775                                                         PCT/US2013/027430
addition of cardiolipin increased the emission intensity of [atn]SS-02 in a concentration
dependent manner (FIGS. 20B and 20G), suggesting interaction of this peptide with the
hydrophobic environment of cardiolipin. Addition of increasing concentrations of
cardiolipin (1.25, 2.5, and 5 gg/mL) to 1 gM [ald]SS-02 showed and even more pronounced
concentration-dependent effect (FIG. 20C). In addition, cardiolipin produced a blue shift in
the Xmax of aladan from 540 nm to 510 nm, further indicating that this compound is
localized in an hydrophobic environment.
[0214]    This SS-02-phospholipid interaction is specific for phospholipids with anionic
headgroups such as phosphatidic acid (POPA), phosphatidylglycerol (DPPG),
phosphatidylserine (POPS) and cardiolipin (CL). FIG. 20D shows representative emission
spectra of 1 gM [ald]SS-02 alone, and following the addition of 10 pg/mLof POPS, POPA,
DPPG or cardiolipin. Cardiolipin shows the highest affinity with [ald]SS-02 (FIG. 20D).
No interaction was observed between [ald]SS-02 and phospholipids that also contain
positive-charged amines in their headgroup, such as phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and
phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) (FIG. 20E), or with the neutral cholesterol (data not
shown).
[0215]    The interaction of [atn]SS-02 with free cardiolipin was also compared with that of
[atn]SS-02 and a liposomal mixture of cardiolipin and POPC. Cardiolipin is normally only
found in the inner mitochondrial membrane, together with phosphatidylcholine and
phosphatidylethanolamine. Because of its small head group and four acyl chains,
cardiolipin induces membrane curvature where the hydrophobic parts are exposed between
neighboring molecules. When mixed with other bilayer phospholipids, cardiolipin is likely
to form a non-bilayer microenvironment, possibly leading to a different interaction with SS
02.
[0216]    A mixture of 1 gM [atn]SS-02 was made with liposomes composed of a 1:1 ratio
of CL and POPC, and the emission intensity was measured. The graph in FIG. 20F shows a
similar concentration-dependent interaction between [atn]SS-02 and cardiolipin/POPC
liposomes (FIG. 20F). These results confirm that the SS peptides have high affinity for
cardiolipin and this accounts for the selective concentration of the SS peptides in the inner
mitochondrial membrane. Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure
are useful for the prevention or treatment of diseases or disorders characterized by

dysregulation of cardiolipin and/or cytochrome c, and/or diseases or disorders characterized
by dysregulation of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction.
Example 22. The peptide SS-02 interacts with soluble cytochrome c.
[0217]     Cytochrome c exists in three pools in mitochondria - a freely soluble pool in the
intermembrane space, a pool that is loosely attached to cardiolipin via electrostatic
interaction, and about 15-20% that is in a tight complex with cardiolipin via hydrophobic
interaction. In order to determine whether SS-02 interacts with cytochrome c, fluorescence
quenching of labeled SS-02 by cytochrome c was examined.
        Materials and Methods
[0218]     Interaction of SS peptides with horse heart cytochrome c in the absence or
presence of free cardiolipin or cardiolipin/POPC (1:1) liposomes (prepared as described in
Example 22) was examined by fluorescence quenching of [atn]SS-02 (Xex/Xem          =  320/420
nm) and [ald]SS-02 (Xex/Xem      = 360/5 10 nm) upon addition of cytochrome c (using a
Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer). The solvents used to dissolve cardiolipin
and POPC had negligible effect on cytochrome c-dependent quenching of these peptides.
All experiments were done in low ionic solution (deionized water) or 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4.
[0219]    Uptake of [atn]SS-02 by isolated mitochondria or cytochrome c-deficient
mitoplasts was determined by fluorescence quenching of [atn]SS-02 (Xex/Xem        = 320/420)
upon addition of a fresh mitochondrial or mitoplast suspension (0.35 mg).
[0220]    Mitochondria were isolated from the kidney of male Sprague-Dawley rats
(Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Wilmington, MA) weighing 250 to 300 g.
Excised kidneys were cut and incubated in wash buffer (200 mM mannitol, 10 mM sucrose,
5 mM HEPES, 1 g/L fatty-acid-free BSA, to pH to 7.4 with KOH) on ice for 10 minutes.
Samples were washed 2 times in isolation buffer (wash buffer with 1 mM EGTA),
homogenized for 3 minutes, and then centrifuged in 20 ml of isolation buffer at 900 x g for
 10 minutes. The white fatty acid layer was then removed and the pellet was discarded. The
supernatant was centrifuged at 11,000 x g for 10 minutes, and the pellet was re-suspended
in 800 [tl of wash buffer and kept on ice for further analysis.

  WO 2013/126775                                                          PCT/US2013/027430
[0221]    Mitoplasts deficient in cytochrome c were prepared by first treating fresh or once
frozen mitochondria with 3.3 mg/ml digitonin for 45 minutes on ice, in order to remove the
mitochondrial outer membrane. To remove electrostatically-bound cytochrome c, 150 mM
KCl pH 7.4 was then added to the mix and centrifuged at 19,000 x g for 30 minutes. The
pellet was collected and re-dissolved in wash buffer and stored on ice until use. Only
mitoplast preparations that responded to the addition of 200 nM exogenous cytochrome c by
4-5 fold increase in mitochondrial respiration (oxygen consumption) were used in the study.
        Results
[0222]    Fluorescence quenching studies show that the SS peptides can interact with soluble
cytochrome c. Addition of cytochrome c resulted in concentration-dependent quenching of
both [atn]SS-02 and [ald]SS-02 with no change in Xmax (FIGS. 21A and 21B). This
quenching by cytochrome c is dose-dependent and readily observed at 1:1 ratio of peptide to
cytochrome c (FIG. 21C). Furthermore, this quenching could not be displaced by albumin.
Fluorescence emission of [ant]SS-02 was quenched by sequential addition of 2 pM of
cytochrome c (labeled C in FIG. 21H). Additions of 75 ptg/ml of BSA (labeled A in FIG.
21H) (total of 300 tg/ml) did not reverse quenching. Fluorescence emission of [ant]SS-02
was also specific for the peptides, as no quenching was observed with other mitochondria
targeted fluorescent probes such as TMRM (tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester). Additions
of 2 pM of cytochrome c (labeled C in FIG. 211) slightly quenched TMRM fluorescence
and 75 ptg/ml of BSA (labeled A in FIG. 211) (total of 225 tg/ml) completely reversed
quenching.
[0223]    It is known that the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp57 in cytochrome c is 98%
quenched by the heme group in natively-folded cytochrome c and is reduced to 40% when
cytochrome c is unfolded (Tsong, 1973, Biochemistry 12:2209-2214). Thus, such
pronounced quenching of SS peptide analogs by cytochrome c suggests that the peptides are
localized in close proximity to the heme to allow energy transfer to this resonance acceptor.
[0224]    The interaction of the SS peptides with cytochrome c was found to be enhanced in
the presence of cardiolipin. The quenching of [atn]SS-02 at 420 nm by cytochrome c in the
absence and presence of cardiolipin was compared. The addition of 2 pM cytochrome c to
 1 pM [atn]SS-02 resulted in ~20% quenching of the fluorescent signal in the absence of
cardiolipin, but almost 50% quenching in the presence of 10 tg/mL cardiolipin (FIG. 21D).
                                                76

  WO 2013/126775                                                          PCT/US2013/027430
The interaction between cytochrome c and [atn]SS-02 was potentiated by either free
cardiolipin or cardiolipin liposomes in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 21E). This finding
shows that the presence of cardiolipin allowed [atn]SS-02 to penetrate even closer to the
heme group deep within cytochrome c to increase resonance transfer.
[0225]    The polarity-sensitive [ald]SS-02 allowed further investigation of the interaction of
SS-02 with cytochrome c in the presence of cardiolipin. The addition of cytochrome c to
cardiolipin and [ald]SS-02 caused a further blue shift in the Xmax from 510 nm to 450 nm,
showing that the peptide penetrated further into the deepest hydrophobic environment of the
heme (FIG. 21F).
[0226]    Finally, to determine if these peptides can interact with cytochrome c that is
hydrophobically bound to cardiolipin, a study was undertaken to examine the quenching of
[atn]SS-02 by cytochrome c-deficient mitoplasts that have been treated with 125 mM KCl
to remove electrostatically-bound cytochrome c. FIG. 21G shows that the quenching of
[atn]SS-02 was appreciable in cytochrome c-deficient mitoplasts but was less than in intact
mitochondria containing all three pools of cytochrome c. All together, these data show that
the SS peptides can interact with free, electrostatically-bound, and hydrophobically-bound
cytochrome c, and the peptides are localized very close to the heme environment.
Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are useful for the
prevention or treatment of diseases or disorders characterized by dysregulation of
cardiolipin and/or cytochrome c, and/or diseases or disorders characterized by dysregulation
of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction.
Example 23. SS-31 and SS-02 inhibit cytochrome c oxidation by cardiolipin.
[0227]    The peptides SS-31 and SS-02 were studied in order to determine whether they had
any functional effects on the interaction between cytochrome c and cardiolipin. Cardiolipin
is known to alter the function of cytochrome c, and readily oxidizes ferrous cytochrome c to
ferric cytochrome c. The oxidation of ferrous cytochrome c in the presence of cardiolipin
can be detected by loss of the 550 nm peak (A5 50 ) in the absorbance spectrum of
cytochrome c. Thus, the peptides SS-31 and SS-02 were examined for their ability to affect
the loss of absorbance by cytochrome c caused by cardiolipin.

        Materials and Methods
[0228]    Cytochrome c (20 tM) was reduced by 50 tM ascorbic acid until all available
functionally active cytochrome c was reduced. The reduction of cytochrome c was
monitored by the appearance of a peak at 550 nm in its absorbance spectrum (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). 100 tg/ml of cardiolipin was then added to the fully reduced
cytochrome c in the presence or absence of SS peptides, and the oxidation of cytochrome c
followed by the rate of decrease in the 550 nm peak. The rate of oxidation was calculated
based on slope of the change in absorbance intensity of 550 nm over 570 nm.
        Results
[0229]    The loss of the 550 nm peak (A550) in the absorbance spectrum of cytochrome c
was prevented by the addition of SS-31 in a concentration-dependent manner (FIG. 22A).
This inhibition of cytochrome c oxidation was also observed for SS-02, [atn]SS-02, and
[ald]SS-02 (FIG. 22B). These data suggest that the aromatic-cationic peptides can interfere
with the structural interaction between cardiolipin and cytochrome c in the heme
environment. Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are useful
for the prevention or treatment of diseases or disorders characterized by dysregulation of
cardiolipin and/or cytochrome c, and/or diseases or disorders characterized by dysregulation
of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction. In addition, aromatic-cationic peptides of the
present disclosure are useful for inhibiting cytochrome c oxidation by cardiolipin.
Example 24. SS-02 and SS-31 peptide analogs interact close to the heme of cytochrome c.
[0230]    Circular dichroism studies have shown the loss of the major negative Cotton peak
in the Soret band of cytochrome c upon the addition of cardiolipin. The negative Cotton
peak reflects electronic interactions (ir-r*) between the heme and aromatic residue side
chains, and the stability of the Fe-Met8O linkage. Thus, Circular Dichroism analysis was
used to examine the impact of the SS peptide analogs on cardiolipin-induced changes in the
heme environment of cytochrome c.
        Materials and Methods
[0231]    Circular Dichroism (CD) spectra were collected with an AVIA 62 DS
spectrophotometer equipped with a sample temperature controller. CD spectra of the Soret

region (370-450 nm) were recorded with 10-mm path length cells containing 20 mM Hepes,
pH 7.4, and 10 iM cytochrome c, in the presence or absence of 30 pig/ml cardiolipin and
different SS peptide analogs (SS-02, [atn]SS-02, [ald]SS-02, and SS-31). The maximum
lipid concentration was kept low to avoid spectral distortions due to excessive light
scattering. All measurements were done at 25'C. All spectra were corrected for
background, and the final spectrum shown represents the average of at least three
experiments.
         Results
[0232]     The addition of cardiolipin (30 tg/ml) to 10 pM cytochrome c resulted in the loss
of the negative Cotton peak at 419 nm and this was prevented by the addition of either SS
02 or its fluorescent analogs ([atn]SS-02 and [ald]SS-02), or SS-31, in a 1:1 ratio with
cytochrome c (FIG. 23). These data show that these aromatic-cationic peptides interact with
cytochrome c in close proximity to the heme and prevent cardiolipin from breaking the
ir-r*  interaction with aromatic side chains, and possibly preventing the rupture of the Fe
Met8O coordination. Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are
useful for the prevention or treatment of diseases or disorders characterized by
dysregulation of cardiolipin and/or cytochrome c, and/or diseases or disorders characterized
by dysregulation of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction.
Example 25. SS-02 and SS-31 peptide analogs inhibit peroxidase activity of cvtochrome c.
[0233]     Unlike pentacoordinated hemes such as hemoglobin and myoglobin, the two axial
ligands (His18 and Met8O) of Fe in cytochrome c prevent direct interaction of H 2 0 2 with the
catalytic metal site and cytochrome c in water has very low peroxidase activity. In the
presence of cardiolipin, the peroxidase activity of cytochrome c increases by 2 orders of
magnitude. By preventing the disruption of the Fe-Met8O bond induced by cardiolipin, the
aromatic-cationic peptides may inhibit cytochrome c peroxidase activity. In order to
examine inhibition of cytochrome c peroxidase activity by SS peptide analogs, Amplex@
Red was used to measure peroxidase activity in the presence of cytochrome c, cardiolipin,
and H 2 0 2 .

        Materials and Methods
[0234]    Assessment of cytochrome c peroxidase activity was achieved using the Amplex@
Red assay (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Amplex@ Red is a reagent that
reacts with H202 in a 1:1 stoichiometry to produce highly fluorescent resorufin (kex/kem =
570/585) in the presence of a peroxidase. In this assay, cytochrome c is added in place of
horseradish peroxidase. 2 ptM cytochrome c was incubated with cardiolipin or cardiolipin
POPC liposomes (10 ptg/ml) for 1 min in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) or deionized water prior
to the addition of 50 ptM Amplex@ Red reagent and 10 iM H2 0 2 , and the reaction was
allowed to proceed for an additional 5 minutes. The continuous time course data were
obtained using Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. When comparing the
different SS peptide analogs (10 tiM) in inhibiting peroxidase activity cytochrome c (2 piM)
in the presence of cardiolipin (100 pig/ml), a microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used for
comparison, and the HRP concentration (0.001 U/ml) was optimized to match the rate of
Amplex@ Red peroxidation by cardiolipin-cytochrome c complex.
        Results
[0235]    All four SS peptide analogs inhibited peroxidase activity of the cardiolipin
cytochrome c complex (FIG. 24). SS-02 and [atn]SS-02 reduce the peroxidation rate of
cytochrome c to about 70% and 75% of control (respectively) , while [ald]SS-02 and SS-31
reduce the peroxidation rate of cytochrome c to about 20% and 35% of control
(respectively). Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are useful
for the prevention or treatment of diseases or disorders characterized by dysregulation of
cardiolipin and/or cytochrome c, and/or diseases or disorders characterized by dysregulation
of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction. In addition, aromatic-cationic peptides of the
present disclosure are useful for inhibiting peroxidase activity in cytochrome c.
Example 26. Comparison of the ability of different peptide analogs to prevent the inhibition
of cytochrome c reduction caused by cardiolipin.
[0236]    Although the addition of cardiolipin greatly inhibits the rate of cytochrome c
reduction induced by either glutathione or ascorbate, addition of SS-31 dose-dependently
prevents this inhibition (see Example 16 and FIG. 14B). A study was undertaken to
                                               80

  WO 2013/126775                                                          PCT/US2013/027430
compare the ability of SS-31 to block the inhibition of cytochrome c reduction with that of
SS-02, [atn]SS-02, and [ald]SS-02.
         Materials and Methods
[0237]    The time course of cytochrome c reduction by ascorbate was recorded at 550 nm
and 570 nm using a 96-well plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For all
reactions, cytochrome c was preincubated with cardiolipin in the presence or absence of SS
peptides for 1 min. 20 iM of cytochrome c and 100 mg/ml of cardiolipin were found to be
optimal, where cardiolipin would inhibit 90% to 100% of cytochrome c reduction regardless
of the reducing agent. Ascorbate (50 tiM) was added to initiate the reduction of cytochrome
c, and the absorbance was recorded for 5 min. The rate of reduction was calculated based
on slope of the change in absorbance intensity of 550 nm over 570 nm.
         Results
[0238]    As shown in the bar graph of FIG. 25, the rate of cytochrome c reduction was
reduced to 10% in the presence of cardiolipin. SS-3 1 was the most effective of the four
peptides in preventing all the functions of the cardiolipin-cytochrome c complex, with the
ability to allow 100% of the cytochrome c reduction rate while in the presence of
cardiolipin. The reduction rate of cytochrome c in the present of SS-02 was about 60%, the
reduction rate in the presence of [atn]SS-02 was about 50%, and the reduction rate in the
presence of [ald]SS-02 was about 90%. Accordingly, aromatic-cationic peptides of the
present disclosure are useful for the prevention or treatment of diseases or disorders
characterized by dysregulation of cardiolipin and/or cytochrome c, and/or diseases or
disorders characterized by dysregulation of the cardiolipin/cytochrome c interaction, such as
systemic autoimmune diseases, e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus and/or antiphospholipid
syndrome. Aromatic-cationic peptides of the present disclosure are useful to prevent the
inhibition of cytochrome c reduction caused by cardiolipin.
