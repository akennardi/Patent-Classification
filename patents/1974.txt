HIGH-EFFICIENCY SOLAR CELL STRUCTURES AND METHODS OF MANUFACTURE
                                       Technical Field
        The present disclosure relates to solar cells.         More particularly, the present
disclosure relates to improved solar cell structures and methods of their manufacture for
increased cell efficiency.
                                         Background
        The reference to prior art in this specification is not and should not be taken as an
acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that the referenced prior art forms part of the
common general knowledge in Australia or in any other country.
        Solar cells are providing widespread benefits to society by converting essentially
unlimited amounts of solar energy into useable electrical power. As their use increases,
certain economic factors become important, such as high-volume manufacturing and
efficiency.
        High volume manufacturing is generally considered to attain a high degree of cost
effectiveness and efficiency if the number of manufacturing steps, and the complexity of
each step, can be minimized.
        Finished solar cell efficiencies of 20% or more are highly desired in the industry,
however, known embodiments of such efficient cells often suffer from cell structure
complexity and/or manufacturing complexity.
        What is required therefore, are solar cells which attain high operational efficiency,
and which can be manufactured in a cost effective manner.
        In the specification the term "comprising " shall be understood to have a broad
meaning similar to the term "including" and will be understood to imply the inclusion of a
stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other
integer or step or group of integers or steps. This definition also applies to variations on
the term "comprising" such as "comprise" and "comprises".

                                           Description
        With reference to the energy band diagram and partial cross-sectional views of
exemplary solar cells of Figs. 1-5, solar radiation is assumed to preferentially illuminate
one surface of a solar cell, usually referred to as the front side. To achieve high energy
conversion efficiency of incident photons into electric energy, an efficient absorption of
photons within the silicon substrate material forming the cell is important. This can be
achieved by a low parasitic optical absorption of photons within all layers except the
substrate itself.
         For the sake of simplicity, the geometrical surface shape of layer surfaces (e.g.,
surface texture such as pyramids, or other surface texture, can be formed on layer
surfaces) is not portrayed in these drawings, however, it is understood that the
geometrical shape and/or surfaces may be textured in any shape beneficial for improved
solar cell efficiency, and falls within the scope of the disclosure.
        One important parameter for high solar cell efficiency is surface passivation.
Surface passivation provides suppression of recombination of electrons and holes at or in
the vicinity of certain physical surfaces within the solar cell. Surface recombination can
be reduced by the application of dielectric layers. These layers reduce the interface
density of states and therefore reduce the number of recombination centers.             Two
examples are thermally grown silicon oxide and PECVD deposited silicon nitride. Another
example of a surface passivating layer is intrinsic amorphous silicon. These layers can
also provide an electrical charge which reduces the number of carriers of the opposite
polarity and reduces recombination rates via this mechanism. Two examples are silicon
nitride and aluminum oxide.
        Another method of reducing the amount of carriers of one type close to a surface
is the diffusion of doping atoms either of the same or the opposite doping of the layer
                                                8

doping type.     In this case doping levels in excess of the layer doping are necessary to
obtain a high-low junction (also commonly called back surface field or front surface field)
or a p-n junction. This can be combined with other methods of surface passivation
mentioned above.
         Surface passivation can play an important role in achieving highly efficient solar
cells. In most of the solar cell structures described below in accordance with the present
disclosure, multiple layers or multifunctional layers can provide excellent surface
passivation.    This can be achieved via a very steep doping profile and an additional
passivation of the interface using a layer with low interface state density and a high band
gap resulting in a tunneling barrier for substrate minority carriers to pass.                 A
corresponding energy band diagram is shown in Fig. 1. The solid lines depict the case of
an n-type crystalline silicon wafer with a passivated interface and doped polycrystalline
silicon passivation layers. The dotted lines represent the case of an n-type crystalline
silicon wafer and a double layer structure of intrinsic amorphous silicon followed by doped
amorphous silicon layer, sometimes referred to as a heterojunction cell.
        These structures provide another benefit for a highly efficient solar cell: the
recombination in areas underneath the contacts can be as low as in areas without
contacts. The contacts can be shielded by the passivation. As a result, the contact area
can be optimized for optical properties, thus minimizing resistive losses, but carrier
recombination is decoupled.
         Depending on the choice of materials, and doping types and concentrations, the
disclosed cell structures may be categorized as front-junction or back-junction cells. In a
front-junction cell the minority carriers (in the case of a p-type wafer these are electrons)
are collected on the side of illumination. In a back junction cell the minority carriers are
collected at the side opposed to the illumination.         Current flow patterns are shown
generally in the partial cross-sectional solar cell views of Figs. 2-5 for p-type and n-type
wafers.
         Fig. 2 shows carrier flow for a solar cell 20, in which minority carriers (solid lines)
flow to front electrodes 21 from a p-type wafer 25 having a front junction. The electrons
need to use lateral flow within the thin n-type emitter 22 to reach the electrodes 21, and
the lateral sheet resistance of the emitter 22 increases resistive losses. The majority
carriers (dashed lines) can use the shortest geometrical path to the full area back
electrode 29.
                                                9

         Fig. 3 shows carrier flow for a solar cell 30 from p-type wafer 35 having a back
junction.    The majority carriers (dashed lines) can use the entire wafer conductivity to
reach the front electrodes 31.      The minority carriers (solid lines) can use the shortest
geometrical path to reach the rear n-type emitter 38, and their transport within the emitter
is vertical instead of mainly lateral. This back junction structure reduces the requirements
for lateral conductivity of the emitter layer.
         Fig. 4 shows carrier flow for a solar cell 40, in which minority carriers (solid lines)
flow to front electrodes 41 from an n-type wafer 45 having a front junction. The holes
need to use lateral flow within the thin p-type emitter 42 to reach the electrodes 41, and
the lateral conductivity of the emitter determines the resistive losses.          The majority
carriers (dashed lines) can use the shortest geometrical path to the full area back
electrode 49.
         Fig. 5 shows carrier flow for a solar cell 50 from an n-type wafer 55 having a back
junction.    The majority carriers (dashed lines) can use the entire wafer conductivity to
reach the front electrodes 51.      The minority carriers (solid lines) can use the shortest
geometrical path to reach the rear p-type emitter 58, and their transport within the emitter
is vertical instead of mainly lateral. This back junction structure reduces the requirements
for lateral conductivity of the emitter layer.
         A back junction cell with a full area back contact has the advantage that the
minority carriers do not have to flow laterally through the emitter to reach the contacts,
their transport within the emitter is mainly vertical. This reduces the losses associated
with the lateral transport of the minority carriers within the emitter. Since the full contact
area coverage is a requirement to benefit from this property of the structure, a shielded
contact is important, e.g., since the metal contacts the layer everywhere ("full area contact
coverage"), there is no need for the minority carriers to flow laterally toward the nearest
contact, like they do within the emitter in, e.g., Fig. 4.
Exemplary Cell Structures: n-type front, n- or p-type wafer, p-type back:
         Fig. 6 is a partial cross-sectional view of a solar cell 60 having an n-type front, n
or p-type wafer, and p-type back.
         The metal electrodes 61 and 69 are positioned on the outer layers 62 and 68,
respectively. This has the benefit that the metal does not need to penetrate underlying
layers before it contacts the wafer. Furthermore the silicon bulk wafer 65 is shielded from
the contact interfaces and hence the contact interface carrier recombination is minimized.
This structure has an n-type front surface, which for a p-type wafer 65 collects the
                                                10

minority carriers (electrons) on the front. Therefore a maximum lateral sheet resistance
of, for example, 500 Ohm/sq of the combined layers 62, 63 and 64 is required. For an n
type wafer this structure collects the minority carriers (holes) on the back. Therefore the
current flow pattern in the solar cell is different and the requirements of lateral conductivity
of layer 62 are less critical. Exemplary layers of cell 60 include the following:
         61: Front metal electrode.
         62: Transparent and conductive film, refractive index in the range of 1.4 < n < 3;

transparent conductive oxides like indium tin oxide, aluminum doped zinc oxide, fluorine
doped tin oxide, tantalum oxide, antimony tin oxide, germanium oxide, zirconium oxide,
titanium oxide, gallium oxide, cadmium antimony oxide.

         Fig. 7 is a partial cross-sectional view of a solar cell 70 having n-type front, n- or p
type wafer, p-type back, in a bifacial configuration.         Cell 70 is similar to cell 60 but
includes localized electrodes 79 on the back. Because of the localized structure on the
back, photons impinging from the rear of the solar cell can be absorbed within the wafer
75 and produce electron-hole pairs. This can increase the power output generated by the
solar cell under outdoor operating conditions where albedo can be used at low additional
module manufacturing and installation cost.

especially beneficial for material combinations where the conductive layers on the front
surface of cell structures 60 and 70 have a high absorption. By placing the electrode 81
directly on the contacting layer 83 the conductivity requirements of layer 82 are waived

         Fig. 9 is a partial cross-sectional view of a solar cell 90 having n-type front, n-type
wafer, p-type back, and including a multifunctional transparent, conductive, highly doped
silicon compound layer. This aspect of the disclosure is an improvement to the other
disclosures above, because the functions of layers 62 and 63 of, e.g., solar cell 60 of Fig.
6 (and any other similar layers in any other embodiments disclosed herein) are combined
into a multifunctional layer 93a depicted in Fig. 9.           This layer can be electrically
passivating, transparent, and sufficiently conductive for a vertical carrier flow to the
electrodes (back junction solar cell), provides the junction with the wafer 95 and/or
reduces the reflectance of the incoming light (e.g., antireflection coating). On the rear,
layer 97a can combine the functions of layers 67 and 68 of, e.g., solar cell 60 of Fig. 6
(and any other similar layers in any other embodiments disclosed herein).            Layer 97a
provides the junction with the wafer 95, has a refractive index which results in a high
reflectivity for photons of more than 900 nm wavelength and is sufficiently conductive for
vertical carrier flow from the wafer 95 to the metal electrode 99. Exemplary layers of cell
90 include the following:
         91: Front metal electrode.
         93a: Electrically passivating, transparent and conductive film, refractive index in
the range of 1.4 < n < 3; thickness in the range of 20 nm <thickness<110 nm ; specific

diamond-like carbon.
         Any of the above examples may include oxygen and hydrogen (n-doped
SiCxOyHz; n-doped SiNxOyHz).
         94: Electrically passivating interface layer; thickness <10 nm; no conductivity

         99: back metal electrode.
         Fig. 10 is a partial cross-sectional view of a solar cell 100 having n- or p-type
wafer, n-type front, including certain front layer improvements, and p-type back. The rear
surface structures (omitted for convenience) can be implemented according to any of the
other structures described herein.
         This structure is especially beneficial for material combinations where the layers
x3 and x4 on, e.g., the front surface of structures disclosed above, have unacceptably
high absorption. (The x3 and x4 notation is further explained below and represents any of
the above layers with reference numerals ending in 3,3a, 4, 4a, respectively). In cell 100,
by placing layers 103 and 104 under the contacts only, their optical properties (refractive
index, absorption) are not important for cell efficiency. Resistance losses only occur
through vertical carrier flow to the contacts 101.      Layers 102, 104b and 105b also do not
have to shield the contact, so they can be optimized for transmissivity and surface
passivation.     If they do provide lateral conductivity, this will facilitate the current flow
towards the contacts and the contact structures can be placed further apart from each
other. This reduces optical shading losses. This structure works best with a back junction
since the lateral conductivity requirements of layer 102, 104b and 105b are waived.
Exemplary layers of cell 100 include the following:
         101: Front metal electrode.
         102: Antireflection film, refractive index in the range of 1.4 < n < 3; thickness <150
nm.     Examples include silicon nitride, silicon carbide, silicon oxide, titanium oxide,
transparent conductive oxides.
         103: Electrically passivating conductive film, e.g., thickness <50 nm ; e.g., specific
resistivity in the range of rho < 1000 Ohm cm. Examples include:
-        n-type amorphous or polycrystalline silicon carbides: phosphorus doped silicon
carbide, nitrogen doped silicon carbide;
-        n-type amorphous or polycrystalline silicon: phosphorus doped amorphous silicon,
nitrogen doped amorphous silicon;
-        n-type amorphous        or  poly-crystalline diamond-like-carbon:     nitrogen   doped
diamond-like carbon.
                                                 16

         Any of the above examples may include oxygen and hydrogen (n-doped
SiCxOyHz; n-doped SiNxOyHz).
         104: Electrically passivating interface layer; thickness <10 nm; no conductivity
requirements because of small thickness; no absorption restrictions due to small
thickness.     Examples include silicon oxide, silicon nitride, intrinsic amorphous silicon,
intrinsic polycrystalline silicon, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, phosphorus nitride,
titanium nitride.
         104b: Electrically passivating interface layer; thickness <110 nm.          Examples
include silicon oxide, silicon nitride, intrinsic amorphous silicon, intrinsic polycrystalline
silicon, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, phosphorus nitride, titanium nitride, silicon
carbide or stacks of two or more of these materials.
          105: n-type or p-type crystalline silicon wafer; thickness is in the range of w<300
um, base resistivity for n-type wafers 0.5 Ohm cm < rho < 20 Ohm cm, for p-type wafers
0.1 Ohm cm < rho < 100 Ohm cm.
         105b: phosphorus diffused silicon layer (optional), sheet resistance >70 Ohm/sq.
         The structures above are not mutually exclusive, and any feature of one structure,
can apply to any other structure herein, in accordance with the present disclosure.
Exemplary Cell Structures: p-type front, n- or p-type wafer, n-type back:
         Fig. 11 is a partial cross-sectional view of a solar cell 110 having a p-type front, n
or p-type wafer, and n-type back.
         In this cell, the metal electrodes 111and 119 are placed on the outer layers 112
and 118, respectively. This provides the benefit that the metal does not need to penetrate
underlying layers before it contacts the wafer. Furthermore the silicon bulk wafer 115 is
shielded from the contact interfaces and hence the contact interface carrier recombination
is minimized. This structure has a p-type front surface, for an n-type wafer this structure
collects the minority carriers (holes) on the front.     Therefore a maximum lateral sheet
resistance of 500 Ohm/sq of the combined layers 112, 113 and 114 is allowed. For a p
type wafer this structure collects the minority carriers (electrons) on the back. Therefore
the current flow pattern in the solar cell is different and the requirements on the lateral
conductivity of layer 112 are less critical.       Exemplary layers of cell 110 include the
following:
         111: Front metal electrodes.

p-type wafer, n-type back, in a bifacial configuration.     Cell 120 is similar to cell 110 but
includes localized electrodes 129 on the back. Because of the localized structure on the
back, photons impinging from the rear of the solar cell can be absorbed within the wafer
125 and produce electron-hole pairs. This can improve the efficiency of the solar cell
under outdoor operating conditions where albedo can be used at low additional module
manufacturing and installation cost.
        Fig. 13 is a partial cross-sectional view of a solar cell 130 having p-type front, p
type wafer, n-type back, and includes isolating the antireflection coating. This structure is
especially beneficial for material combinations where the conductive layers on the front
surface of cell structures 110 and 120 have a high absorption. By placing the electrodes
131 directly on the contacting layer 133 the conductivity requirements of layer 132 are
waived and traditional antireflection coating films (which are insulators) can be used. This

         Fig. 15 is a partial cross-sectional view of a solar cell 150 having n- or p-type
wafer, p-type front, including certain front layer improvements, and n-type back. The rear
surface structures (omitted for convenience) can be implemented according to any of the
other structures described herein.
                                                22

         This structure is especially beneficial for material combinations where the layers
xx3 and xx4 on, e.g., the front surface of structures disclosed above, have unacceptably
high absorption. In cell 150, by placing layers 153 and 154 under the contacts only, their
optical properties (refractive index, absorption) are not important for cell efficiency.
Resistance losses only occur through vertical carrier flow to the contacts 151.          Layers
152, 154b and 155b also do not have to shield the contact, so they can be optimized for
transmissivity and surface passivation.        If they do provide lateral conductivity, this will
facilitate the current flow towards the contacts and the contact structures can be placed
further apart from each other. This reduces optical shading losses. This structure works
best with a back junction since the lateral conductivity requirements of layer 152, 154b
and 155b are waived. Exemplary layers of cell 150 include the following:
          151: Front metal electrode.
          152: Antireflection film, refractive index in the range of 1.4 < n < 3; thickness
thickness<1 10 nm. Examples include silicon nitride, silicon carbide, silicon oxide, titanium
oxide.
          153: Electrically passivating conductive film, thickness <110 nm; specific resistivity
in the range of rho < 1000 Ohm cm. Examples include:
-         p-type amorphous or polycrystalline silicon carbides: boron doped silicon carbide,
aluminum doped silicon carbide, gallium doped silicon carbide;
-         p-type amorphous or polycrystalline silicon: boron doped silicon, aluminum doped
silicon, gallium doped silicon;
-         p-type amorphous or poly-cystalline diamond-like-carbon: boron doped diamond
like carbon, aluminum doped diamond-like carbon.
         Any of the above examples may include oxygen and hydrogen (p-doped
SiCxOyHz; p-doped SiNxOyHz).
          154: Electrically passivating interface layer; thickness <10 nm; no conductivity
requirements because of small thickness; no absorption restrictions due to small
thickness.     Examples include silicon oxide, silicon nitride, intrinsic amorphous silicon,
intrinsic polycrystalline silicon, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, phosphorus nitride,
titanium nitride.
          154b: Electrically passivating interface layer; thickness <10 nm. Examples include
silicon oxide, silicon nitride, intrinsic amorphous silicon, intrinsic polycrystalline silicon,
aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, phosphorus nitride, titanium nitride, silicon carbide.
                                                 23

          155: n-type or p-type crystalline silicon wafer; thickness is in the range of w<300
um, base resistivity for n-type wafers 0.5 Ohm cm < rho < 20 Ohm cm, for p-type wafers
0.1 Ohm cm < rho < 100 Ohm cm.
         155b: phosphorus diffused silicon layer (optional), sheet resistance >70 Ohm/sq.
        The structures above are not mutually exclusive, and any feature of one structure,
can apply to any other structure herein, in accordance with the present disclosure.
Exemplary Cell Structures - Alternative Electrode Configurations:
         Fig. 16 is a partial cross-sectional view of a solar cell 160 having glass or other
transparent film with embedded electrodes, compressed or bonded to the cell.              This
alternative applies to any of the structures above, and can include an n- or p-type front, n
or p-type wafer, and p- or n-type back. As an alternative to the metal electrodes being
deposited directly on the cell, the metal electrodes 161 and 169 are embedded in a glass
or other laminating films 161a and 169a.              When the glass or laminating film is
compressed or laminated under pressure, the embedded electrodes make contact on top
of the outer layers 162 and 168, respectively. This has the benefit that the metal does not
need to be deposited directly onto the cell itself, thereby eliminating a typical source of
film stress which can cause cell bowing. This is particularly useful when dealing with very
large area wafers, such as thin-film silicon sheets and/or very thin wafers. In many of the
embodiments above, the metal electrodes do no need to penetrate underlying layers
before they contact the cell.       Moreover, various conducing materials can be used to
enhance the electrical conductivity between the metal electrodes 161 and 169 and the
surface of the outer layers 162 and 168. These conducting materials could include but
are not limited to anisotropic conducting films (ACF), conductive epoxies, or spring-like
contact probes. Exemplary layers of cell 160 include the following (which can be formed
of any of the materials above, omitted here for simplicity):
161 a: Glass plate or transparent film carrying embedded metal electrodes.
161:     Front metal electrode.
162:    Transparent and conductive film.
163:     Electrically passivating and conductive film.
164:     Electrically passivating interface layer.
165:     n-type or p-type crystalline silicon wafer; thickness is the range of w<300 um.
166:     Electrically passivating interface layer.
                                                24

167:    Electrically passivating and conductive film.
168:    Transparent and conductive film.
169:    Back metal electrode.
169a: Glass plate or transparent film carrying embedded metal electrode.
        Fig. 17 is a partial cross-sectional view of a solar cell 170 having glass or other
transparent film with embedded electrodes, compressed or bonded to the cell, having
localized electrodes 179 on the back. Because of the localized electrode structure on the
back, photons impinging the rear of the solar cell can be absorbed within the wafer 175
and produce electron-hole pairs in this bifacial configuration.      This can improve the
efficiency of the solar cell under outdoor operating conditions where albedo can be used
at low additional module manufacturing and installation cost.
        This alternative applies to any of the structures above, and can include an n- or p
type front, n- or p-type wafer, and p- or n-type back.       As an alternative to the metal
electrodes being deposited directly on the cell, the metal electrodes 171 and 179 are
embedded in a glass or other laminating films 171a and 179a.            When the glass or
laminating film is compressed or laminated under pressure, the embedded electrodes
make contact on top of the outer layers 172 and 178, respectively. This has the benefit
that the metal does not need to be deposited directly onto the cell itself, thereby
eliminating a typical source of film stress which can cause cell bowing. This is particularly
useful when dealing with very large area wafers, such as thin-film silicon sheets and/or
very thin wafers. In many of the embodiments above, the metal electrodes do no need to
penetrate underlying layers before they contact the cell.     Moreover, various conducing
materials can be used to enhance the electrical conductivity between the metal electrodes
171 and 179 and the surface of the outer layers 172 and 178.             These conducting
materials could include but are not limited to anisotropic conducting films (ACF),
conductive epoxies, or spring-like contact probes. Exemplary layers of cell 170 include
the following (which can be formed of any of the materials above, omitted here for
simplicity):
171 a: Glass plate or transparent film carrying embedded metal electrodes.
171:    Front metal electrode.
172:    Transparent and conductive film.
173:    Electrically passivating and conductive film.
                                              25

174:    Electrically passivating interface layer.
175:    n-type or p-type crystalline silicon wafer; thickness is the range of w<300 um.
176:    Electrically passivating interface layer.
177:    Electrically passivating and conductive film.
178:    Transparent and conductive film.
179:    Back metal electrode.
179a: Glass plate or transparent film carrying embedded metal electrode.
        The structures above are not mutually exclusive, and any feature of one structure,
can apply to any other structure herein, in accordance with the present disclosure.
Fabrication Methods:
        The following process flows are examples of methods to produce the structures
disclosed above; but other methods are possible without departing from the scope of the
present disclosure. Initially, the incoming wafer is obtained free of surface damage, may
be textured or otherwise modified in its geometrical shape, and has a clean surface. As
discussed above, and for the sake of simplicity, the geometrical surface shape of layer
surfaces (e.g., surface texture such as pyramids, or other surface texture, can be formed
on layer surfaces) is not portrayed in these drawings, however, it is understood that the
geometrical shape and/or surfaces may be textured in any shape beneficial for improved
solar cell efficiency, and falls within the scope of the disclosure.
        Subsequent processing steps can be as follows (the use of the designation such
as "xx4" or any other similarly designated number connotes the analogous layers of any
of the above structures of Figs. 1-18 ending in "4" or "4a" such as 4, 14, 134, 4a, 14a,
134a, etc):
-       Deposition or growth of the interface passivation layers xx4 and xx6;
-       Deposition of layers xx3 and xx7;
-       Thermal treatment;
-       Optional deposition of layers xx2 and xx8 (including possibly a low reflective index
layer for a good internal mirror on the back - refractive index basically smaller than 3.0,
smaller than 2.6, smaller than 2.0, smaller than 1.5); and
-       Metallization.
                                                26

         In any of the structures above, the layers (e.g., xx2, xx3, xx4, xx6, xx7 and xx8)
are electrically conductive are electrically conductive, i.e., the metallization can be placed
directly on the outer layer.   (In typical high-efficiency solar cells this is not the case since
surface passivation is usually done by materials that are also electrical insulators.) This
allows for innovative metallization schemes, for example, the solar cells can be laminated
into a module which has the electrodes embedded in the glass or in the lamination
sheets.    Furthermore, conductive sheets can be applied to mechanically strengthen the
cells. Another way of metallization could involve the deposition of thin lines of metals.
Due to the conductivity of the surfaces, the requirements on the metal paste are reduced
because they directly contact the outer layers and do not need to etch through an
insulating layer in order to contact the solar cell. Another example would be the direct
evaporation or sputtering of metal onto the conductive surfaces.
         Most layers within the solar cell structures described above can be deposited or
grown with methods such as PECVD, APCVD, LPCVD, PVD, plating etc. For some layers
and combinations of layers, innovative methods of producing the layers and structures
may be useful. For example, thermal oxidation or plasma deposition or plasma assisted
oxidation can be used to form the interface passivating layer(s).
         For example, in order to achieve a highly efficient solar cell with a cost-effective
production method, it is advantageous to deposit films of different characteristics only on
one side. While this can be difficult to do, (e.g., for a standard tube furnace deposition of
e.g. LPCVD deposited polycrystalline silicon), a PECVD deposition can be done on one
side of a wafer without deposition on the other side. PECVD tools are available on an
industrial scale but may only operate in temperature regimes where amorphous or
microcrystalline silicon layers can be deposited. In the described cell structures,
amorphous silicon layers can be turned into polycrystalline silicon layers by thermal
treatment.    This also holds true for doped amorphous silicon layers or compounds of
amorphous silicon carbides, etc. This crystallization negatively affects the passivation
quality of the silicon/amorphous silicon interface layer (if it exists in the cell structure).
However, layers xx4 and xx6 buffer the wafer surface from the crystallized polysilicon
layer. Therefore, the interface is still passivated after the thermal treatment and the layer
systems are stable at the thermal-treatment temperature.
         In accordance with the present disclosure, during the crystallization process many
properties of the layer change: Donors or acceptors get activated, the optical transmission
increases, hydrogen effuses from the layer. The thermal treatment may activate doping
                                                27

atoms in the compound and result in diffusion of dopant atoms into a substrate wafer to
provide a high-low junction or a p-n junction.
         In accordance with the present disclosure, good passivation of layers xx4 and xx6
persists and/or improves after high temperature thermal treatment. Passivation may be
adequate after deposition, but the high temperature thermal treatment can improve its
character. The passivation is temperature-stable (from 5000C, or 6000C, or 7000C,            to
1100 C or more) because of the composition of the layers. Thermal treatment at 500 C
or more therefore comprises an aspect of the present disclosure. Other potential benefits
of the structure may include: thermal treatment may not modify the crystallinity of the
silicon substrate, at least at the interface, because the first interface layer is amorphous
SiO2, and/or because the conductive layer is SiC.            Therefore another aspect of the
present disclosure contemplates providing a thermal treatment without modifying the
crystallinity of the silicon substrate, and/or that the interface passivation layer acts as a
buffer for re-crystallization during thermal treatment.
         If the layer composition is chosen correctly, a layer deposited in a single process
can split into two (or more) layers. The incorporated oxygen in the amorphous deposited
layer migrates toward the silicon interface and a thin oxide can be grown.              If this
mechanism is exploited by the use of oxide containing films xx3 and xx7, the passivating
interface layers xx4 and xx6 do not need to be produced prior to layers xx3 and xx7,
therefore all described structures can also work without layers xx4 and xx6. At the same
time the film crystallizes and dopants may be activated. This effect can be employed to
create structures such as cells 90 and 140 disclosed above, in a very short process flow,
but it is not restricted to this application.      For that reason layers xx3 and xx7 in all
structures can be used to employ this mechanism if they contain a low amount of oxygen
and the list of examples is expanded by the same layers containing oxygen.
         In case the passivating interface layers xx4 and xx6 and the highly doped layers
xx3 and xx7 were deposited or grown with built-in stress, or the thermal treatment for
crystallization described above creates stress, this can negatively affect the passivation
properties of the wafer surface xx5.        In order to prevent this negative effect, and with
reference to the partial cross sectional view of solar cell 180 of Fig. 18 a thin silicon film
1831 and 1871 can be deposited on top of the passivation films 184 and 186, to act as a
buffer layer.     Fig. 18 illustrates this concept of a silicon buffer layers 1831 and 1871
between the passivation layers 184 and 186 and the highly doped layers 183a, and 187a,
respectively. This concept is particularly beneficial for cells 90 and 140 disclosed above,
but its application is not limited to these structures.
                                                28

         This silicon buffer layer can be, for example, undoped polysilicon.     In this case,
since the film can be deposited on both sides, a standard tube furnace can be used. In a
process sequence where the passivation layers 184 and 186 are a thin thermal oxide, the
process of oxidation can directly be followed by the deposition of polycrystalline silicon, in
the same furnace but a different tube (saving handling of wafers) or even in the same
tube.     The doping needed for passivation can be produced by driving dopants
incorporated in films      183a and 187a, with the temperature treatment             used for
crystallization at the same time drives the dopants from layers 183a and 187a into layers
1831 and 1871 respectively, making them passivating and conductive.             The allowed
thickness of the buffer layer depends on the doping level of the doped layers which are
deposited on top as well as on the time/temperature profile that is used for crystallization
of this doped top layer. The undoped layer is doped during this thermal treatment by the
doped layers 183a and 187a. The buffer layers 1831 and 1871can also be composed of
multiple silicon layers.
         Another effect of the thermal treatment is the re-organization of the passivating
interface layers 184 and 186. Depending on their thickness, the thermal treatment and
the layers over them, these layers shrink and via-holes open (e.g., perforation occurs)
such that the adjacent layers 1831 and 1871 can make contact to the wafer 185 directly.
A very small fraction of the interface allows the carriers to bypass the layers 184 and 186.
If the thermal treatment is chosen in a way that no or insufficient via-holes open up, the
layers 184 and 186 need to be thin enough to allow for tunneling of the carriers.
         Other aspects of the present disclosure include improved methods of metallization
fabrication. In one example, metallization for any of the above structures can be formed
in accordance with previously filed U.S. Provisional Application entitled "Method for
Forming Structures in a Solar Cell," filed 21 April 2009 and assigned application number

Applications, metallization may be formed according to a method of forming a conductive
contact/heterocontact pattern on a surface of solar cell, including forming a thin
conductive layer over at least one lower layer of the solar cell, and ablating a majority of
the thin conductive layer using a laser beam, thereby leaving behind the conductive
contact/heterocontact pattern.       A self-aligned metallization may be formed on the
conductive contact pattern.        The   lower layer may include a passivation and/or
                                               29

antireflective layer beneath the thin conductive layer, wherein the conductive contact
pattern forms an electrical contact through the at least one lower layer to a semiconductor
layer of the solar cell.

accordance with previously filed U.S. Provisional Application entitled "Localized Metal

contact in the area of the layer.        A remaining region of the layer may comprise a
functional layer of the solar cell and need not be removed; e.g., a transparent, conductive
film, and anti-reflective film, and/or passivation as disclosed above.
        The present disclosure extends to any one or a combination of the solar cell
structures disclosed above, including generally a central substrate, conductive layer(s),
