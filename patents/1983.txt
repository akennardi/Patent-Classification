Abstract
A chair to be used with dining tables whereby the height and width of dining tables have been
factored into the design. It is made of powder-coated steel. It consists of two legs, each with two
supports connecting them to the seat. The seat is curved and round in shape. The backrest is mounted
to the seat via its central support stem, which is mounted near the back of the seat. The backrest
resembles a leaf and the legs resemble skis or ice skates. The single stemmed backrest required some
amounts of engineering to make it have function as well as form. The legs are joined by a horizontal
support at the base. It takes a conventional four leg approach to chair construction and changes it to
present two ski-like legs. The legs reference skiing and ice skating.

Description
It is a chair designed primarily for dining tables, average height and width of
dining tables have been factored in to the design. It has been designed with
ergonomics in mind, in regards to the chairs proportions and the curvature of
both the seat and the backrest. It is made of powder-coated steel. It consists of
two legs, each with two supports connecting them to the seat. The seat is curved
and round in shape. The backrest is mounted to the seat via its central support
stem, which is mounted near the back of the seat. The backrest resembles a leaf
and the legs resemble skis or ice skates.

Claims
This chair looks nostalgic, yet it is truly innovative. The single stemmed backrest
required some amounts of engineering to make it have function as well as form.
The result is an uncommon design that looks like it couldn't work, but it does.
The legs are joined by a horizontal support at the base. This feature, like the
backrest is something unseen in furniture. It takes a conventional four leg
approach to chair construction and changes it to present two ski like legs. The
legs reference skiing and ice skating.
