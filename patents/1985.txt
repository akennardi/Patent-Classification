                                             Abstract
        Example vehicle alignment systems for use at loading docks are disclosed herein. An
example vehicle alignment system includes a sensor system to detect a surface of a vehicle,
where the sensor system obtains a feedback signal representative of a spatial orientation of
the detected surface relative to a reference as the vehicle approaches a doorway of the loading
dock. A controller detects a threshold deviation in the spatial orientation of the detected
surface of the vehicle relative to the reference based on the feedback signal. A display varies
an output signal in response to the detected deviation in the spatial orientation of the detected
surface relative to the reference.

               VEHICLE ALIGNMENT SYSTEMS FOR LOADING DOCKS
                                      Field of the Disclosure
[0001]      The present disclosure relates generally to vehicle loading docks and, more
specifically, to vehicle alignment systems for loading docks.
                                           Background
[0002]      Typical loading docks provide an area for trucks to back up to an elevated platform
of a building so that cargo can be exchanged with the truck and/or its trailer. The cargo is
transferred though a dock doorway of the building and a rear access door of the truck. To
facilitate or improve the loading and/or unloading operations, some loading docks include
equipment such as weather barriers, dock levelers and/or vehicle restraints.
[0003]      Weather barriers, such as dock seals and dock shelters, are installed on the exterior
of the building along the perimeter of the dock doorway. During loading and unloading of
cargo, weather barriers seal or shelter a gap that would otherwise exist between the rear of the
truck and the dock face of the building. By sealing or sheltering this area, weather barriers
reduce (e.g., minimize) exchange of air and/or contaminants between the outdoor
environment and the interiors of the truck and the building. Specific examples of dock
shelters and dock seals are disclosed in US patents 6,205,721; 6,233,885; 7,185,463 and
8,307,588, which are incorporated herein by reference.
[0004]      Dock levelers typically comprise a pivotal or otherwise vertically adjustable deck
with a retractable lip extension. The deck and lip provide an adjustable bridge between the
truck and the building's elevated platform. The adjustable bridge serves as a path across
which material handling equipment can travel as the equipment carries cargo to and from the
truck. Examples of such material handling equipment include forklifts, pallet trucks, and
automatic guided vehicles (e.g., laser guided vehicles). Examples of dock levelers are
disclosed in US patents 5,440,772; 6,311,352; and 7,213,285, which are incorporated herein
by reference.
[0005]     Vehicle restraints help secure a truck at the dock during loading and/or unloading
operations. Vehicle restraints are often installed on the exterior of the building, beneath the
doorway. Vehicle restraints usually have a moveable barrier to selectively block and release
                                                -1 -

the vehicle's RIG (rear impact guard or sometimes known as an ICC bar). Some vehicle
restraints also include means for supporting the underside of the RIG to impede downward
movement of the trailer bed of the truck as the weight of cargo and material handling
equipment is added to the truck. Some example vehicle restraints are disclosed in US patents
8,678,736 and 8,616,826, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.

                                        Detailed Description
[0053]     Example vehicle alignment methods, systems, apparatus and/or articles of
manufacture for use at loading docks are disclosed herein. Example vehicle alignment
systems disclosed herein monitor, align and/or guide a vehicle that is parked at or
approaching a loading dock. Some example vehicle alignment systems disclosed herein
include one or more example sensor systems that monitor spatial characteristics of a vehicle
(e.g., surfaces of interest of a vehicle), such as an orientation (e.g., of a RIG) of a vehicle as
the vehicle moves or backs into a loading dock and/or as the vehicle is being loaded and/or
unloaded of cargo. The example monitored orientation may be with respect to any spatial
characteristic such as, for example, the vehicle's angular position, lateral position and/or
distance away from a reference point such as, for example, a doorway of the loading dock. In
some examples, a display may provide a visual indication of the vehicle's alignment to help
guide a driver of the vehicle to properly dock the vehicle. Some example sensor systems
disclosed herein monitor the orientation of the vehicle's standardized RIG (rear impact
guard). In some examples, an example sensor system disclosed herein moves vertically to
follow corresponding vertical movement of the RIG. In some examples, an example sensor
system disclosed herein may be mounted to a vertically movable portion of a vehicle
restraint.
[0054]     FIGS. 1 - 6 show an example vehicle alignment system 10 to help determine or
confirm that a vehicle 12 is aligned with a doorway 14 of a loading dock 16. An alignment
as disclosed herein, for example, pertains to the vehicle's angular alignment, lateral
alignment and/or distance from a dock face 18 and/or any other target reference of the dock
16. For example, angular alignment is a measure of the perpendicularity between the
vehicle's longitudinal centerline 22 and a front edge 24 of (e.g., below) the dock doorway 14.
In some examples, a lateral alignment is a measure of the placement, position and/or
orientation (e.g., horizontally centered) of the vehicle's longitudinal centerline 22 relative to a
reference (e.g., the dock doorway 14, a longitudinal centerline 26 of a dock leveler 28). In
some examples, a lateral alignment is a measure of how close the vehicle's longitudinal
centerline 22 is (e.g., horizontally centered) relative to a reference (e.g., a longitudinal
centerline 26 of a dock leveler 28).
                                                 -5-

[0055]      The term, "vehicle" may include any wheeled apparatus with a cargo bay for
transporting cargo. Examples of the vehicle 12 include, but are not limited to, a truck, an
enclosed trailer, a van, and/or an open trailer. In some examples, the vehicle 12 has a vehicle
doorway 20 with one or more doors 30 for providing access to a vehicle's cargo bay. Some
examples of the one or more doors 30 swing open, as shown in FIG. 1. Other examples of
the one or more doors 30 translate between open and closed positions, such as a rollup door
or segmented articulated door (e.g., similar to a conventional garage door).
[0056]      Additional features of the vehicle 12 include a rear surface 32 (FIGS. 3 and 7), a
first lateral side 34, a second lateral side 36 (FIG. 7) and a roof 38. In some examples, the
lateral sides 34 and 36 include swung-open door panels. The rear surface 32 is any surface of
the vehicle 12 that faces generally in the vehicle's rearward travel direction 40 as the vehicle
12 backs into the dock 16. For example, the rear surface 32 is generally orientated toward the
dock face 18 when the vehicle 12 backs into the dock 16. The vehicle's rearward travel
direction 40 is generally opposite to a forward direction 42 in which dock face 18 faces.
[0057]      Some examples of the vehicle 12 include a RIG 44 (e.g., a rear impact guard, also
known as an ICC bar). A RIG or ICC bar is a structural beam that is elongate in a lateral
direction 46 and extends horizontally across the rear of the vehicle 12, below the vehicle's
doorway 20. The RIG 44 helps prevent an automobile or another vehicle from under-riding
the vehicle 12 in a rear-end collision.
[0058]      The term, "loading dock" or "dock" refers to any area comprising a driveway 48
leading to the doorway 14 through which cargo passes between the vehicle 12 and a platform
50 of a building 52. The platform 50 is elevated relative to the driveway 48 even though the
platform 50, in some examples, is the floor of the building 52. To facilitate the transfer of
cargo, some examples of the loading dock 16 include the dock leveler 28. In some examples,
the dock leveler 28 includes a pivotal and/or otherwise vertically adjustable deck 54 with an
extendible lip 56, where the deck 54 and the lip 56 provide an adjustable bridge between the
vehicle 12 and the platform 50.
[0059]      Some examples of the loading dock 16 include a vehicle restraint 58 to help ensure
that the vehicle 12 is properly parked and secured at the dock 16 during loading and/or
unloading operations. The vehicle restraint 58 shown in FIGS. 1-6 is schematically
illustrated to represent a device having a movable barrier 60 to selectively block and release
the vehicle's RIG 44. Some examples of the vehicle restraint 58 also include a structure, a
support, a brace, and/or other means for supporting the underside of the RIG 44 to impede or
restrict downward movement of the vehicle's truck or trailer bed as the weight of cargo
                                                 -6-

and/or material handling equipment is added to the vehicle 12. Some examples of the vehicle
restraint 58 are disclosed in US patents 8,678,736 and 8,616,826, which are incorporated
herein by reference. Although the vehicle alignment system 10 can be used with any type of
vehicle restraint, some examples of system 10 disclosed herein work particularly well with
vehicle restraints that have an upwardly biased stored position, where rearward travel of the
vehicle 12 along a (e.g., a ramp) portion of the vehicle restrain forcibly lowers the restraint to
an operative RIG-blocking position.
[0060]     Additionally or alternatively, some examples of the loading dock 16 include a
weather barrier 62 that, during loading and/or unloading operations, reduces (e.g., minimizes)
the exchange of air (e.g., and any contaminants and/or precipitation in the air) between the
outdoor environment and the interiors of the vehicle 12 and/or the building 52. The weather
barrier 62 is schematically illustrated to represent different types of weather barriers
including, but not limited to, dock shelters and/or dock seals. Some example dock shelters
and/or dock seals are disclosed, for example, in US patents 6,205,721; 6,233,885; 7,185,463
and 8,307,588, which are incorporated herein by reference.
[0061]     In the example illustrated in FIGS. 1 - 6, the vehicle alignment system 10
comprises a sensor system 64 (e.g., example sensor systems 64a-j shown in FIGS. 7-44 and
disclosed below), a controller 66, and a display 68 (e.g., example displays 68a-e shown in
FIGS. 7-44 and disclosed below). The sensor system 64 is schematically illustrated to
represent any device and/or a collection of devices that generates a feedback signal 70 in
response to detecting a feature (e.g., a spatial parameter, a RIG, a surface such as an upper
comer of a trailer, an edge or midpoint of a bay opening, etc.) of the vehicle 12, where the
detected feature provides an indication of at least some part of the vehicle's orientation,
condition and/or position (e.g., the vehicle's alignment relative to a reference point).
Examples of the sensor system 64 include, but are not limited to, a sensor system 64a of
FIGS. 8 - 18, a sensor system 64b of FIG. 19, a sensor system 64c of FIGS. 20 and 21, a
sensor system 64d of FIGS. 22 and 23, a sensor system 64e of FIGS. 24-26, a sensor system
64f of FIG. 29, a sensor system 64g of FIGS. 30-33 and 37-39, a sensor system 64h of FIGS.
34-36, a sensor system 64i of FIGS. 40-43, and/or a sensor system 64j of FIG. 44. Examples
of the sensor system 64 operate under various principles, examples of which include, but are
not limited to, active infrared, passive infrared, ultrasonic, radar, microwave, laser,
electromagnetic induction, pressure (e.g., pressure pad), electomechanics (e.g., a limit
switch), ultra-IR LED, time-of-flight pulse ranging technology, photoelectric (e.g.,
photoelectric eye), video analytics, photo analytics, and/or various combinations thereof.
                                                -7-

Example formats of the feedback signal 70 include, but are not limited to, a binary value
(e.g., on/off), a digital value, an analog value, an image (e.g., an image file), a video (e.g., a
video file), and/or various combinations and pluralities thereof.
[0062]     Some example features of the vehicle 12 detected by the sensor system 64 include,
but are not limited to, an edge of a body (e.g., a trailer), a surface, the absence of a surface, an
outline of a structure (e.g., a perimeter of the cargo bay opening), an image of a body (e.g., an
image of a trailer), etc. In some examples, the part or parts of the vehicle 12 that are
monitored, detected and/or sensed by the sensor system 64 can vary. Examples of such parts
include, but are not limited to, the vehicle's rear surface 32 (e.g., including but not limited to
a rear surface of the RIG 44), the vehicle's first lateral side 34, the second lateral side 36, the
roof 38, an upper rear edge 72 of the vehicle 12, a first rear edge 74 of the vehicle 12, a
second rear edge 76 of the vehicle 12, a door panel, the RIG 44, lateral edges 78 of the RIG
44, upper and/or lower edges of the RIG 44, and/or any other surface and/or edge of the
vehicle 12, etc.
[0063]     Examples of the vehicle's orientation include, but are not limited to, the
perpendicularity of the vehicle's longitudinal centerline 22 relative to the front edge 24 (e.g.,
of the doorway 14 and/or the dock face 18), a proximity (e.g., alignment of) the vehicle's
longitudinal centerline 22 (e.g., horizontally centered) relative to the dock doorway 14, and/or
a proximity (e.g., alignment of) the vehicle's longitudinal centerline 22 (e.g., horizontally
centered) relative to the dock leveler's longitudinal centerline 26 and/or a longitudinal
centerline of the vehicle restraint 58. Examples of the vehicle's condition include, but are not
limited to, whether the vehicle 12 has a RIG, a size (e.g., a length or a width) of the RIG 44,
and/or the straightness of the RIG 44. Examples of the vehicle's position include, but are not
limited to, a distance between the RIG 44 and the dock face 18, a distance between the RIG
44 and the front edge 24, and/or the vehicle's distance from the doorway 14 and/or from the
front edge 24.
[0064]     The feedback signal 70 from the sensor system 64 is communicated to the
controller 66 for interpretation and/or processing. The controller 66 as shown in FIGS. 1-6 is
schematically illustrated to represent any circuitry (e.g., wiring, relays, IC circuit, computer,
microprocessor, programmable logic controller, logic circuit and/or various combinations
thereof) that receives and/or analyzes the feedback signal 70 to determine an alignment
between, for example, the vehicle 12 and the dock doorway 14 and/or to command an
operation of the display 68 based on feedback signal 70. The controller 66 can reside at any
convenient location, and/or various parts of the controller 66 can be distributed over multiple
                                                 -8-

locations. Example locations of the controller 66 include, but are not limited to, housed
within a separate enclosure, housed within an enclosure that contains one or more parts of the
display 68, housed within an enclosure that contains one or more parts of the sensor system
64, and/or various combinations thereof. In some examples, all or part of the sensor system
64 share a common enclosure with all or part of the display 68.
[0065]      The display 68 is schematically illustrated to represent any device (or plurality of
devices) that provides a visual indication of the vehicle's alignment (e.g., angular alignment,
lateral alignment, etc.), distance from the dock face 18 (or distance from an alternate
reference), condition (e.g., a condition of the RIG 44), instructions, warnings and/or prompts.
Examples of the display 68 include, but are not limited to, a display 68a of FIGS. 9 - 13, a
display 68b of FIGS. 14 - 19, a display 68c of FIGS. 24, 25, 26 and 29, a display 68d of FIG.
27, a display 68e of FIG. 28, one or more lights, lights of different shapes, lights of different
color, a text message, a symbol, an icon, a flashing light, virtual traveling lights, LED lights,
a video monitor, and/or various combinations thereof, etc.
[0066]      FIG. 1 shows the vehicle 12 backing into the dock 16 by traveling in rearward
direction 40 toward the loading dock 16, and FIG. 2 shows the vehicle 12 (e.g., properly or
sufficiently) docked at the loading dock 16. The docking sequence is illustrated in FIGS. 3
6, where FIG. 3 shows the vehicle 12 backing into the loading dock 16, and FIG. 4 shows the
vehicle's RIG 44 engaging a lead-in edge 80 of the vehicle restraint 58. In some examples,
as the vehicle 12 continues traveling back from the example position of FIG. 4 to the example
position of FIG. 5, the RIG 44 slides along lead-in edge 80 to force a main body 82 of the
vehicle restraint 58 down underneath the RIG 44, as shown in FIG. 5. Once the vehicle 12 is
properly parked for loading and/or unloading operations, the barrier 60 of the vehicle restraint
58 rises in front of the RIG 44, as shown in FIG. 6, to restrain or secure the vehicle 12 at a
docked position. The sensor system 64 monitors or senses the docking process, the controller
66 receives, analyzes or interprets the feedback signal 70 from the sensor system 64, and the
display 68 communicates the status and/or results based on the feedback signal 70 to the
vehicle's driver or other personnel in the area of the loading dock 16 and/or the dock
doorway 14.
[0067]      In the examples shown in FIGS. 8 - 18, the sensor system 64a includes a plurality
of overhead sensors 64' that emit and/or receive a beam-like projection 84 (e.g., active
infrared, passive infrared, ultrasonic, radar, microwave, laser, ultra-IR LED, time-of-flight
pulse, photoelectric, video image, photo image, etc.) directed (e.g., generally vertically or
downwardly) to detect the presence and/or an alignment (e.g., an offset absence) of the
                                                -9-

vehicle 12 relative to a reference (e.g., the dock doorway 14). In some examples, the
projection 84 is referred to as a field of view. In the example of FIGS 8 - 18, four sensors 64'
are utilized, where the two (e.g., laterally) outer sensors 64' (e.g., outer sensor pair) detect the
lateral alignment of generally wider examples of the vehicle 12, as shown in FIGS. 9 - 13,
and the two more (e.g., centrally located) inner sensors 64' (e.g., inner sensor pair) detect the
lateral alignment of more narrow examples of the vehicle 12, as shown in FIGS. 14 - 18.
[0068]      FIG. 9 shows the two outer sensors 64' being uninterrupted (e.g., non-activated,
non-triggered) by the vehicle 12 while the two inner sensors 64' are interrupted (e.g.,
activated, triggered) by the vehicle's roof 38. This feedback provided by the outer sensors
64' and the inner sensors 64' can indicate that the vehicle 12 (e.g., a longitudinal centerline
of the vehicle 12) is aligned (e.g., substantially aligned, laterally centered, etc.) relative to a
reference such as, for example, the dock doorway 14. The interrupted/uninterrupted states of
sensors 64' are communicated to the controller 66, which interprets the feedback and controls
the display 68a accordingly. In the case of FIG. 9, the controller 66 commands the display
68a to emit and/or otherwise generate a (e.g., central) light 86 indicating proper, sufficient or
satisfactory (e.g., lateral) alignment of the vehicle 12 (e.g., a longitudinal axis and/or other
surface of the vehicle 12) relative to the dock doorway 14.
[0069]      FIG. 10 shows the vehicle 12 (e.g., a longitudinal axis and/or other surface of the
vehicle 12) shifted or offset slightly (e.g., offset slightly to the left within an acceptable
threshold) relative to a reference (e.g., the dock doorway 14). As shown in the example of
FIG. 10, the two outer sensors 64' are uninterrupted by the vehicle 12 while the two inner
sensors 64' are interrupted. In this example case, the generally wider the vehicle 12 is within
an allowable tolerance (e.g., a lateral distance of being laterally centered) relative to the dock
doorway 14. The interrupted/uninterrupted states of the sensors 64' are communicated to the
controller 66, which interprets the feedback and commands the display 68a to emit the (e.g.,
central) light 86 indicating the vehicle 12 is within an acceptable tolerance of proper lateral
alignment relative to, for example, the dock doorway 14.
[0070]      FIG. 11 shows the vehicle 12 shifted or offset (e.g., offset so far to the left outside
an acceptable threshold) that one of the outer sensors 64' (e.g., the far left outer sensor 64' in
the orientation of FIG. 11) is interrupted by the vehicle 12. Regardless of the states of the
other three sensors 64', the controller 66 interprets the interruption of the triggered (e.g., the
far left) outer sensor 64' to indicate that the vehicle 12 is shifted outside an alignment
threshold (e.g., too far to the left as shown in FIG. 11) relative to, for example, a reference
(e.g., a centerline of the doorway 14 or the restraint 18). Consequently, the controller 66
                                                 - 10 -

commands the display 68a to emit a signal indicative of the vehicle 12 being unaligned (e.g.,
offset too far) relative to a reference (e.g., a centerline of the doorway 14 or the restraint 18).
In the illustrated example of FIG. 11, the display 68a emits, for example, a left arrow light 88.
[0071]      FIG. 12 is similar to FIG. 10 but with the vehicle 12 shifted or offset slightly to the
right instead of the left in the orientation of FIG. 12 within an acceptable alignment tolerance
relative to a reference (e.g., the dock doorway 14). The two outer sensors 64' as shown in
FIG. 12 are uninterrupted by the vehicle 12 while the two inner sensors 64' are interrupted.
In this case, the generally wider the vehicle 12 is within the allowable alignment tolerance
(e.g., laterally centered) relative to a reference (e.g., a dock doorway 14). The
interrupted/uninterrupted states of sensors 64' are communicated to the controller 66. In
response to the feedback from the sensors 64', the controller 66 commands the display 68a to
emit the (e.g., central) light 86 to indicate that the vehicle 12 is within the acceptable
tolerance or alignment (e.g., a lateral alignment) relative to the reference (e.g., the doorway
14).
[0072]      FIG. 13 shows vehicle 12 shifted or offset (e.g., offset so far to the right in the
orientation of FIG. 13) outside of the alignment tolerance such that the (e.g., far right) outer
sensor 64' in the orientation of FIG. 13 is interrupted by the vehicle 12. Regardless of the
states of the other three sensors 64', the controller 66 interprets or determines the interruption
of the triggered (e.g., far right) outer sensor 64' to indicate that the vehicle 12 (e.g., a
longitudinal axis or centerline of the vehicle 12) is outside the alignment tolerance or
threshold (e.g., shifted too far to the right in the orientation of FIG. 12) relative to the
reference (e.g., the dock doorway 14). Consequently, the controller 66 commands the display
68a to emit a signal indicative of the vehicle 12 being outside the alignment threshold (e.g.,
unaligned or offset too far) relative to a reference (e.g., the dock doorway 14, a centerline of
the dock doorway 14 and/or the vehicle restraint 18).. In the illustrated example of FIG. 13,
the display 68a emits a right arrow light 90.
[0073]      FIGS. 14 - 18 are similar to and correspond to FIGS. 9 - 13, respectively. In the
example of FIGS. 14 - 18, the vehicle 12 (e.g., a trailer or body of the vehicle 12) is narrower
than (e.g., a trailer or body of) the example vehicle 12 in FIGS. 9 - 13. The example system
10 of FIGS. 14 - 18 includes the display 68b having a series of lights 92 (e.g., series of
LEDs) that are controlled to indicate various alignment conditions of the vehicle 12 relative
to a reference such as, for example, the dock doorway 14.
[0074]      FIG. 14 shows the two outer sensors 64' being uninterrupted by the vehicle 12
while the two inner sensors 64' are interrupted by the vehicle's roof 38. Such an
                                                  - 11 -

interruption/uninterrupted pattern indicates that the vehicle 12 is aligned (e.g., laterally
centered) relative to the reference and/or the dock doorway 14. The interrupted/uninterrupted
states of the sensors 64' are communicated to the controller 66, which interprets or analyzes
the feedback and controls the display 68b. In the example case of FIG. 14, the controller 66
commands the display 68b to steadily energize all of the lights 92, thereby indicating proper
lateral alignment of the vehicle 12 relative to a reference (e.g., the dock doorway 14).
[0075]      FIG. 15 shows the vehicle 12 shifted or offset slightly (e.g., to the left in the
orientation of FIG. 15) relative to a reference (e.g., the dock doorway 14). In the illustrated
example of FIG. 15, the two outer sensors 64' are uninterrupted by the vehicle 12 while the
two inner sensors 64' are interrupted. In this case, the vehicle 12 is still within an allowable
tolerance of being aligned (e.g., laterally centered) relative to the reference (e.g., dock
doorway 14). The interrupted/uninterrupted states of the sensors 64' are communicated to the
controller 66, which interprets the feedback and commands the display 68b to steadily
energize all of the lights 92, thereby indicating the vehicle 12 is within an acceptable
tolerance of being aligned (e.g., proper lateral alignment) relative to the reference.
[0076]      FIG. 16 shows vehicle 12 shifted or offset (e.g., so far to the left in the orientation
of FIG. 16) outside an alignment threshold such that one of the (e.g., right) inner sensors 64'
is uninterrupted by the vehicle 12. Regardless of the states of the other three sensors 64', the
controller 66 interprets or determines the uninterrupted state of the (e.g., right) inner sensor
64' as a result that the vehicle 12 is not aligned (e.g., shifted too far to the left) relative to the
reference. Consequently, the controller 66 commands the display 68b to emit a signal
indicative of a misalignment between the vehicle 12 and the reference (e.g., an alignment
outside the alignment threshold). In the illustrated example, the display 68b energizes the
lights 92 in a sequential pattern that provides a visual illusion of a movement 94 (e.g., a series
of lights providing a "visual illusion of movement"). In some examples, the lights 94 appear
to move to in a first direction (e.g., to the right) to indicate the direction the vehicle 12 should
shift or move (e.g., laterally) to improve the vehicle's (e.g., lateral) alignment relative to the
reference (e.g., within the acceptable alignment tolerance). In some examples, the lights 94
appear to move in a second direction (e.g., to the left) to indicate the direction the vehicle 12
is laterally offset relative to the reference (e.g., the doorway 14). In some examples, the
lights 92 illuminate an arrow-like pattern.
[0077]      FIG. 17 is similar to FIG. 15 but with the vehicle 12 shifted or offset slightly (e.g.,
to the right instead of the left) relative to the reference. The two outer sensors 64' are
uninterrupted by the vehicle 12 while the two inner sensors 64' are interrupted. In this case,
                                                  - 12 -

the narrower vehicle 12 is within the allowable alignment tolerance aligned (e.g., laterally
centered) relative to the doorway 14. The interrupted/uninterrupted states of the sensors 64'
are communicated to the controller 66, which responds by commanding the display 68b to
steadily energize all of the lights 92, thereby indicating the vehicle 12 is within an acceptable
tolerance of alignment (e.g., proper lateral alignment) relative to the reference.
[0078]      FIG. 18 shows the vehicle 12 shifted or offset outside the alignment tolerance (e.g.,
so far to the right in the orientation of FIG. 18) such that the (e.g., left) inner sensor 64' is
uninterrupted by the vehicle 12. Regardless of the states of the other three sensors 64', the
controller 66 interprets the uninterrupted state of the (e.g., left) inner sensor 64' as evidence
that the vehicle 12 is shifted too far to the right. Consequently, the controller 66 commands
the display 68b to energize the lights 92 in a sequential pattern that provides a visual illusion
of a movement 96. In some examples, the lights 92 appear to move to the left to indicate the
direction the vehicle 12 should shift in order to improve the vehicle's lateral alignment. In
some examples, the lights 92 appear to move to the right to indicate the direction the vehicle
12 is laterally offset relative to the doorway 14. In some examples, the lights 92 illuminate
an arrow-like pattern.
[0079]      In the example shown in FIG. 19, the example sensor system 64b includes two
pluralities of overhead sensors 64' that each emit and/or receive a beam-like projection 84
directed (e.g., generally vertically and/or downwardly) to detect the presence or an alignment
(e.g., an offset absence) of the vehicle 12 relative to a reference (e.g., the dock doorway 14).
The controller 66 compares the feedback from the sensors 64' to determine whether the
vehicle 12 is within an alignment threshold (e.g., laterally aligned). In some examples, the
sensors 64' are separate discrete elements, in which each element is separated by a distance.
In some examples, multiple sensors 64' are packaged in a single housing, whereby a single
sensor assembly emits and/or receives a plurality of generally parallel projections 84.
[0080]      In the example shown in FIGS. 20 and 21, the sensor system 64c includes two
sensors 64' that each emit and/or receive a beam-like projection 84 directed (e.g., generally
horizontally, sideways and/or perpendicularly) relative to the vehicle's lateral sides (e.g., the
first lateral side 34, the second lateral side 36, a side of a trailer, a side of a truck, a side of a
swung-open door 30). In some examples, the sensors 64' are supported by brackets 98 that
are attached to the dock face 18 or to some other structure of the building 52 and/or the dock
16. Each sensor 64' generates feedback that indicates or otherwise provides a distance from
the associated lateral side (e.g., the first lateral side 34 or the second lateral side 36) of the
vehicle 12. The controller 66 compares the feedback from the sensors 64' to one or more
                                                  - 13 -

threshold values to determine whether the vehicle 12 is aligned (e.g., centered or laterally
offset) within an alignment threshold, and commands the display 68 accordingly. For
example, if a distance value provided by the first sensor 64' (e.g., the top sensor in the
orientation of FIG. 20) is equal to or substantially equal to a distance value provided by the
second sensor 64' (e.g., the bottom sensor), the controller 66 determines that the vehicle 12 is
within the alignment threshold. In some examples, substantially equal distances include a
difference between the first distance value and the second distance value that is
approximately between 0.1 inches and 12 inches. In some examples, the controller 66 adjusts
the display 68 to identify which of the first lateral side 34 or the second lateral side 36
satisfies or exceeds the one or more threshold values.
[0081]      In a similar example, shown in FIGS. 22 and 23, the sensor system 64d comprises
two sensors 100 each in the form of an electromechanical switch (e.g., a limit switch). Each
sensor 100 includes and/or is associated with a mechanical actuator 102 (e.g., a lever, a
paddle, pivotal plate, a trigger, a finger, a feeler, etc.) that triggers the sensor 100 to change
state upon the actuator 102 engaging one of the vehicle's first lateral side 34 or second lateral
side 36 and/or door panels. Each sensor 100 provides feedback indicating the sensor's state.
The controller 66 interprets the feedback from the sensors 100 to determine whether the
vehicle 12 is centered or is laterally offset outside the alignment threshold, and commands the
display 68 accordingly. FIG. 22 shows the vehicle 12 laterally centered with neither sensors
100 being triggered and FIG. 23 shows one sensor 100 triggered due to the vehicle 12 being
outside of the alignment threshold relative to a reference (e.g., too far laterally off center with
respect to the second lateral side 36 while the first lateral side 34 untriggered.
[0082]      FIGS. 24, 25 and 26 show an example vehicle alignment system 104 that includes
the sensor system 64e comprising one or more cameras 106 (e.g., a video camera and/or a
still camera) aimed to capture at least one image of the vehicle 12. Upon capturing the at
least one image, the sensor system 64e generates an image signal 70a (feedback) having one
or more images (e.g., a first image 108a and a second image 108b). The controller 66
receives and/or interprets the image signal 70a to determine whether the vehicle 12 is within
an alignment threshold (e.g., laterally centered (lateral position), angularly aligned (angular
orientation), and/or sufficiently close to dock face 18 (front-to-back position)). The
controller 66 compares the image signal 70a to a reference 110 (e.g., a reference Cartesian
coordinate axis having any number of individual axes) to determine whether the image signal
70a deviates (e.g., laterally, angularly, and/or front-to-back) beyond one or more acceptable
                                                 - 14 -

limits or threshold. In some examples, the reference 110 is a template image to be compared
with one or more image signals 70a acquired by the one or more cameras 106.
[0083]      Based on the comparison, the controller 66 commands the display 68c to indicate
whether the vehicle's position or angular orientation (during approach or after docking) is
acceptable or within one or more tolerance values (e.g., threshold values indicative of a
distance, an angle or orientation, a number of pixels from one or more cameras 106, etc.). In
the illustrated examples of FIGS. 24-26, the display 68c provides a first signal 112 or a
second signal 114, wherein the first signal 112 indicates an acceptable approach or docked
position, and the second signal 114 indicates an unacceptable approach or docked position.
In some examples, the signals 112 and 114 are emitted from a single light source and are
distinguishable by blinking frequency. In some examples, the blinking frequency varies in
response to the vehicle's severity of misalignment relative to the reference. For example, the
farther away a lateral distance from an acceptable tolerance threshold the misalignment, the
greater the blinking frequency. In some examples, the signals 112 and 114 are emitted from
separate light sources and are distinguishable by color. In some examples, the color of light
varies in response to the vehicle's severity of misalignment.
[0084]      Some example images are shown in FIGS. 24 -26.          In FIG. 24, images 108a and
108b show that the vehicle's rear edges 76 and 74 are aligned with both axes of reference 110
(the axes of reference 110 includes a horizontal axis 1 Ox and a vertical axis 1 Oy), thereby
indicating that vehicle 12 is aligned relative to a reference (e.g., the dock doorway 14) within
an acceptable threshold (e.g., properly centered and angularly aligned relative to the dock
doorway 14 and/or the dock face 18). In FIG. 25, images 108a and 108b show that the
vehicle's rear edges 76 and 74 are offset (e.g., to the left in the orientation of FIG. 25) relative
to a vertical axis 1 Oy, thereby indicating that the vehicle 12 is laterally offset (e.g., to the left
outside of an acceptable alignment threshold). In FIG. 26, images 108a and 108b show that
the vehicle's second rear edge 76 is farther back than the vehicle's first rear edge 74, thereby
indicating that vehicle 12 is angularly misaligned relative to a reference (e.g., the x-axis 11 Ox
and/or the y-axis 1 Oy).
[0085]      Some examples of the display 68 (e.g., the displays 68a-e) provide one or more
distinguishable visual signals that represent different alignment or position conditions so that
the vehicle's driver can determine the type of misalignment relative to a reference, for
instance, whether the vehicle 12 is only angularly misaligned, whether the vehicle 12 is only
laterally misaligned, whether the vehicle 12 is misaligned both laterally and angularly,
whether the vehicle 12 is offset laterally (e.g., to the right or to the left), whether the vehicle
                                                - 15 -

12 is only slightly misaligned (e.g., within an alignment threshold), and whether the vehicle
12 is severely misaligned (e.g., outside of an alignment threshold). One or more
determinations of slightly misaligned and/or severely misaligned may be determined by
comparing one or more sensor system 64 values with one or more threshold values. The
visual signals from the display 68 or 68c can be distinguishable by way of color, flashing
frequency, text message, arrows, travel direction of virtual moving lights, etc.
[0086]     FIG. 27, for example, shows a display 68d having an (e.g., a circular) array of lights
116 that are sequentially energized to create a visual illusion of movement in a rotational
direction, e.g., a clockwise direction 118 or a counterclockwise direction 120. In some
examples, the rotational direction indicates in which direction the vehicle 12 should be
rotated to correct a misalignment. In some examples, the rotational direction indicates the
angular direction that the vehicle 12 is misaligned. In some examples, the rotational direction
indicates the direction the vehicle's driver should rotate the steering wheel in order to correct
a lateral and/or angular misalignment. Additionally or alternatively, FIG. 28 shows the
display 68e with separate arrow lights 122 and 124 for indicating clockwise or
counterclockwise rotation.
[0087]      FIG. 29 shows an example vehicle alignment system 126 that is similar to the
vehicle alignment system 104 shown in FIGS. 24 - 26. However, the sensor system 64f of
the vehicle alignment system 126 of FIG. 29 has only one overhead camera 106 aimed to
capture at least one image of the vehicle 12. Upon capturing the at least one image, the
sensor system 64f generates an image signal 70b (feedback) including one or more images.
The controller 66 receives and interprets the image signal 70b to determine whether the
vehicle 12 is aligned (e.g., laterally centered (lateral position), angularly aligned (angular
orientation), and/or sufficiently close to dock face 18 (front-to-back)). The controller 66
compares the image signal 70b to a reference 128 to determine whether the image signal 70b
deviates (e.g., laterally, angularly, and/or front-to-back) beyond an acceptable limit.
[0088]     Based on the comparison, the controller 66 commands the display 68c to indicate
whether the vehicle's position or angular orientation (during approach or after docking) is
acceptable or within one or more tolerance values. In the example of FIG. 29, the image 130
shows that during the vehicle's approach, the vehicle's rear edges 76 and 74 indicate that the
vehicle 12 is aligned relative to the reference 128 (e.g., properly centered laterally and are
angularly aligned). However, the controller 66 determines that, based on a dimension 132 the
vehicle 12 of the illustrated example is spaced too far away from dock face 18 (e.g., the front
to-back being outside an acceptable threshold).
                                                - 16 -

[0089]     In some examples, such as those shown in FIGS. 30 - 42, various examples of the
sensor system 64 (e.g., the sensor systems 64g and 64h) monitor the position and/or angular
orientation of the RIG 44. The US Interstate Commerce Commission's standardization of
RIGs can make the RIG 44 a more accurate or convenient target for monitoring than other
structural features of the vehicle 12. As such, a reference (e.g., a template) having a shape
and/or dimensions associated with a structural feature of interest (e.g., the RIG 44) may be
compared with information acquired by the sensor system 64.
[0090]     In the example of FIGS 30 - 33, the sensor system 64g is installed below the dock
doorway 14 with the sensor system's field of view or projection 84' aimed at the RIG 44.
The controller 66 determines the RIG's lateral alignment based on the field of view's
symmetry (e.g., FIG. 31) or lack of symmetry (e.g., FIGS. 32 and 33). FIG. 31 shows the
RIG 44 laterally centered, FIG. 32 shows the RIG 44 offset laterally to one side (e.g., outside
a desired alignment threshold), and FIG. 33 shows the RIG 44 laterally offset to the other side
(e.g., outside a desired alignment threshold). In some examples, a similar sensing concept is
used for detecting the angular orientation of the RIG 44.
[0091]     In the example shown in FIGS. 34 - 36, the sensor system 64h includes a series of
sensors 64' operating in a manner similar to that shown in FIG. 19. In FIGS. 34 - 36,
however, the sensors 64' detect lateral alignment and/or misalignment of the RIG 44 rather
than the lateral alignment and/or misalignment of the vehicle's roof 38, as shown in FIG. 19.
The controller 66 compares the feedback from sensors 64' to determine whether the vehicle's
RIG 44 is laterally misaligned relative to a reference (e.g., a centerline of the vehicle restraint
58). FIG. 34 shows the RIG 44 laterally centered, FIG. 35 shows the RIG 44 offset laterally
to one side (e.g., outside a desired alignment threshold), and FIG. 36 shows the RIG 44
laterally offset to the other side (e.g., outside a desired alignment threshold). In some
examples, the example sensing system 64h may detect the angular orientation of the RIG 44
(e.g., similar to the example system 64i of FIGS 40 - 42).
[0092]     The example shown in FIGS. 37 - 39 is similar to the examples of FIGS. 30 - 36.
However, in FIGS. 37 - 39, the example sensor system 64g aligns itself (e.g., vertically)
relative to various elevations of the RIG 44. In some examples, after the vehicle 12 is
restrained at the dock 16, the sensor system 64g has the ability to subsequently follow the
vertical movement of the RIG 44 and/or the vehicle restraint 58. To enable the sensor
system 64g to follow vertical movement of the RIG 44 and/or the vehicle restraint 58, the
sensor system 64g is mounted to a vertically movable support. In some examples, such a
                                                 - 17 -

vertically movable support is a main body 82 of the vehicle restraint 58. In other examples,
the vertically movable support is separate from the vehicle restraint 58.
[0093]     In the example illustrated in FIGS. 37 - 39, the sensor system 64g is attached to the
main body 82 (attached either directly or via some suitable bracket), and a spring or biasing
element 134 (e.g., or comparable actuator) urges the main body 82 upward to a stored
position (FIGS. 37 and 39). In some examples, the vehicle 12 backing into the loading dock
16 from the position of FIG. 4 to that of FIG. 5 forces the main body 82 downward
underneath the RIG 44. As a result, the sensor system 64g is positioned at the same elevation
as the RIG 44. Thus, due to the spring 134, the main body 82 and the sensor system 64g
follow (e.g., continuously) any subsequent vertical movement of the RIG 44. Such
movement of the RIG 44 can occur due to cargo and/or other weight being added and/or
removed from the vehicle 12. FIG. 38 shows the RIG 44, the main body 82 and the sensor
system 64g at a first elevation (e.g., aligned at a height relative to a driveway on which the
vehicle is parked or a floor of the loading dock 16), and FIG. 39 shows the RIG 44, the main
body 82 and the sensor system 64g at a second or lower elevation different than the first
elevation. At these two elevations and at various intermediate elevations between these two
example elevations, the sensor system 64g remains vertically aligned relative to the RIG 44.
[0094]     FIGS. 40 - 42 show the sensor system 64i having two sensors 64' to monitor the
angular orientation of the RIG 44. The example sensor system 64i can be mounted to any
suitable structure 136. Examples of the structure 136 include, but are not limited to, the
vehicle restraint 58, the main body 82, the dock face 18, the platform 50, the dock leveler 28,
a bracket, etc. FIG. 40 shows a top view of the RIG 44 aligned angularly relative to a
reference within an acceptable threshold (e.g., having the proper angular orientation), FIG. 41
shows the top view of the RIG 44 being angularly misaligned in one direction (e.g., outside
of the alignment threshold), and FIG. 42 shows the top view of the RIG 44 being misaligned
(e.g., outside of the alignment threshold) in the opposite direction. The controller 66
interprets the feedback from the sensor system 64i to determine whether the vehicle's RIG 44
is in proper angular alignment and/or is at a desired or proper distance from structure 136.
[0095]     The sensor system 64i of FIG. 43 is similar to the sensor system 64i of FIGS. 40
42. However, in FIG. 43, the sensor system 64i is positioned to sense a rear surface 32 or
some other feature of the vehicle 12 other than the RIG 44 (e.g., a vertical or horizontal edge
of the vehicle defining the cargo bay opening of a trailer). The controller 66 interprets the
feedback from the sensor system 64i to determine whether the vehicle 12 is in proper angular
                                               - 18 -

alignment and/or is within a desired or proper distance from the dock doorway 14 for safe
loading and/or unloading operations.
[0096]      In the example shown in FIG. 44, a bracket 138 aims sensor system 64j to lateral
side 36 of vehicle 12. Sensor system 64j includes two spaced apart sensors 64' to monitor the
angular orientation of vehicle 12.
[0097]     Although numerous mounting locations for various examples of the sensor system
64 are disclosed herein, example methods, apparatus, systems and/or articles of manufacture
disclosed herein are not limited thereto. In some examples, for instance, the sensor system 64
is installed in a location for not only detecting the position and/or orientation of the vehicle
12, but is installed so as to also detect the position or movement of various dock-related
equipment such as, for example, the deck 54, the lip 56, the vehicle restraint 58, a door
associated with the dock doorway 14, and/or a door of vehicle 12. In some examples, the
sensor system 64 includes one or more sensors installed within an interior of the building 52
with the sensor's projection 84 or 84' passing through the dock doorway 14.
[0098]      FIG. 45 is a block diagram representative of an example implementation of the
example controller 66 of FIGS. 1-44. In the illustrated example of FIG. 45, the controller 66
includes a vehicle alignment manager 450, a sensor system interface 452, a sensor
interruption manager 454, an alignment indicator manager 456, a sensor distance manager
458, a reference manager 460, a reference data store 462, a vehicle restraint interface 464,
and a sensor alignment manager 466. The example sensor system interface 452, the example
sensor interruption manager 454, the example alignment indicator manager 456, the example
sensor distance manager 458, the example reference manager 460, the example reference data
store 462, the example vehicle restraint interface 464, the example sensor alignment manager
466, and the example vehicle alignment manager 450 are communicatively connected via an
example communication bus 468.
[0100] In operation, the example sensor system interface 452 facilitates control and data
acquisition of one or more sensors of the example sensor system 64. As described above,
example sensors of the sensor system 64 may include, but are not limited to example sensor
systems 64a-j shown in FIGS. 7-44 that employ active infrared, passive infrared, ultrasonic,
radar, microwave, laser, electromagnetic induction, pressure, electromechanics, ultra-IR
LED, time-of-flight pulse ranging, photoelectric, video analytics, and/or photo analytics. The
example sensor system interface 452 obtains information from the sensor system 64 via the
feedback signal(s) 70, which represent a binary value (e.g., on/off), a digital value, an analog
value, an image and/or a video. In some examples, the sensor system 64 retrieves, receives
                                                - 19 -

and/or otherwise obtains information from the feedback signal(s) as a voltage signal (e.g., a
direct current voltage value) that, when compared to a sensor device look-up table (reference)
reveals a corresponding physical state (e.g., a pressure value in pounds per square inch, a
distance in centimeters, etc.). While the aforementioned example refers to a voltage signal,
example methods, systems, apparatus and/or articles of manufacture disclosed herein are not
limited thereto. In some examples, the sensor system 64 obtains a current value (e.g., 4-20
milliamp) such that circuit break detection may be identified and/or to obtain error resistant
measurements in relatively noisy (e.g., electromagnetic noise) environments.
[0101] The example sensor interruption manager 454 of the illustrated example of FIG. 45
identifies instances when a sensor 64, such as the example overhead sensors 64' (sensors 64a
and/or sensors 64b) shown in FIGS. 8-19, is/are interrupted or non-interrupted. As described
above, the example overhead sensors 64' emit and/or receive a beam projection (e.g., active
infrared, passive infrared, ultrasonic, radar, microwave, laser, ultra-IR-LED, time-of-flight
pulse, photoelectric, etc.) to detect the presence or absence of the vehicle 12. In some
examples, the beam projection sensors (e.g., overhead sensors 64' of FIGS. 8-19) provide a
binary output as either on or off (e.g., zero or one) depending on whether an object
breaks/interrupts the beam.
[0102] However, in still other examples, the employed sensors 64 generate an output value
indicative of a distance from an object (see sensor system 64c of FIGS. 20 and 21), such as a
distance from a lateral side (e.g., the first lateral side 34, the second lateral side 36, etc.) of
the vehicle 12. The example sensor distance manager 458 of FIG. 45 receives, retrieves
and/or otherwise obtains the output signal from the sensor system 64c and determines a
corresponding distance to the object that intersects the beam projection 84.
[0103] In some examples, the employed sensors 64 are electromechanical in nature and,
when such sensors make physical contact with one or more portions of the example vehicle
12, an output signal indicative of contact is received, retrieved and/or otherwise obtained by
the example sensor interruption manager 454. For example, FIGS. 22 and 23 illustrate the
sensor system 64d that is triggered in response to the actuator 102 engaging one of the
vehicle's first lateral side 34 or second lateral side 36. While the illustrated examples of
FIGS. 22 and 23 include the first lateral side 34 or the second lateral side 36, example
methods, apparatus, systems and/or articles of manufacture disclosed herein are not limited
thereto. Any other portion(s) of the example vehicle 12 may contact the example actuator
102 to cause an indication of alignment. In some examples, the indication of alignment (or
misalignment) may be a binary signal from the sensor system 64d, in which the actuator 102
                                                  - 20 -

is either contacted or non-contacted (not engaged via contact by the vehicle 12). In some
examples, the sensor system 64d produces discrete values of varying degrees of contact that
range from non-contact to a maximum contact value indicative of a distance value.
[0104] In some examples, the sensor system interface 452 interacts with sensors that acquire
video and/or picture images to be used with one or more reference templates to determine
alignment and/or misalignment conditions. In the illustrated examples of FIGS. 24-26 and
29, the example sensor system interface 452 communicates with the sensor system 64e and
the sensor system 64f, which include one or more cameras 106. As described above, the
example cameras 106 capture video or still images of one or more portions of the vehicle 12.
Images captured by the example cameras 106 are analyzed by the example reference manager
460 to determine whether an alignment violation condition is true. In some examples, the
reference manager 460 retrieves, receives and/or otherwise receives reference template(s)
from the example reference data store 462. In the illustrated example of FIG. 24, the
reference 110 includes a Cartesian coordinate axis (e.g., the horizontal axis 1 Ox and the
vertical axis 1 10y) as a template to which one or more images captured by the camera(s) 106
is/are compared. In the event the captured image crosses and/or otherwise impedes the
example reference 110, the vehicle alignment manager 450 deems a misalignment condition
to be true.
[0105] In some examples, the vehicle alignment manager 450 invokes the reference manager
460 to determine whether the vehicle 12 includes standardized equipment. As described
above, the US Interstate Commerce Commission has standardized RIGs such that parameters
(dimensions) thereof are consistently employed on vehicles 12. Such dimensions are, in
some examples, stored in the example reference data store 462 and, when compared by the
example reference manager 460 to sensor 64 input, determine the presence or absence of
standardized equipment on the example vehicle 12, as shown in FIGS. 30-36.
[0106] In some examples, the vehicle alignment manager 450 identifies instances of
alignment and/or misalignment after the vehicle 12 is restrained to the loading dock 16. As
described above, the example sensor system 64g is installed in a manner to align with one or
more vertical positions of the vehicle 12 by way of its placement on the example vehicle
restraint 58 or a main body 82 of the vehicle restraint. For instance, movement of the
example vehicle 12 may occur after being restrained due to cargo and other weight being
added or removed from the vehicle 12, as shown in FIGS. 37-39. The example vehicle
restraint interface 464 monitors the state of the example movable barrier to determine
whether the vehicle 12 is restrained or not restrained. In response to the example vehicle
                                               - 21 -

restraint interface 464 determining that the vehicle 12 is restrained, the example sensor
alignment manager 466 identifies one or more reference points of the vehicle 12, such as an
orientation of the example RIG 44. A value associated with the initial orientation of the
example RIG 44 is stored in a memory, such as in the example reference data store 462, for
later comparison that may identify one or more instances of misalignment. For example, in
the event the example vehicle 12 is initially restrained to the example dock 16 in an unloaded
condition, and an excess amount of cargo is loaded onto the vehicle 12, the example sensor
system 64g value is compared to the initial value to determine if one or more thresholds is/are
exceeded. As such, misalignment conditions may be identified before during cargo loading
and/or unloading.
[0107] When any of the example sensor interruption manager 454, example sensor distance
manager 458 and/or the example reference manager 460 indicate a condition of alignment
and/or misalignment, the example alignment indicator manager 456 generates one or more
signals to cause a display to alert personnel of alignment and/or misalignment. In some
examples, the alignment indicator manager 456 generates control signals for the display 68 of
FIGS. 1-3, 6, 8-19, 21, 24-29 and 38. As described above, the example display 68 may
operate in any configuration of illumination or shape.
[0108] While an example manner of implementing the controller 66 of FIGS. 1-44 is
illustrated in FIG. 45, one or more of the elements, processes and/or devices illustrated in
FIG. 45 may be combined, divided, re-arranged, omitted, eliminated and/or implemented in
any other way. Further, the example sensor system interface 452, the example sensor
interruption manager 454, the example alignment indicator manager 456, the example sensor
distance manager 458, the example reference manager 460, the example reference data store
462, the example vehicle restraint interface 464, the example sensor alignment manger 466
and/or, more generally, the example vehicle alignment manager 450 of FIG. 45 may be
implemented by hardware, software, firmware and/or any combination of hardware, software
and/or firmware. Thus, for example, any of the example sensor system interface 452, the
example sensor interruption manager 454, the example alignment indicator manager 456, the
example sensor distance manager 458, the example reference manager 460, the example
reference data store 462, the example vehicle restraint interface 464, the example sensor
alignment manger 466 and/or, more generally, the example vehicle alignment manager 450
could be implemented by one or more analog or digital circuit(s), logic circuits,
programmable processor(s), application specific integrated circuit(s) (ASIC(s)),
programmable logic device(s) (PLD(s)) and/or field programmable logic device(s)
                                               - 22 -

(FPLD(s)). When reading any of the apparatus or system claims of this patent to cover a
purely software and/or firmware implementation, at least one of the example sensor system
interface 452, the example sensor interruption manager 454, the example alignment indicator
manager 456, the example sensor distance manager 458, the example reference manager 460,
the example reference data store 462, the example vehicle restraint interface 464, the example
sensor alignment manger 466 and/or, more generally, the example vehicle alignment manager
450 is/are hereby expressly defined to include a tangible computer readable storage device or
storage disk such as a memory, a digital versatile disk (DVD), a compact disk (CD), a Blu
ray disk, etc. storing the software and/or firmware. Further still, the example vehicle
alignment manager 450 of FIG. 45 may include one or more elements, processes and/or
devices in addition to, or instead of, those illustrated in FIG. 45, and/or may include more
than one of any or all of the illustrated elements, processes and devices.
[0109] Flowcharts representative of example machine readable instructions for implementing
the vehicle alignment manager 450 of FIG. 45 are shown in FIGS. 46-51. In these examples,
the machine readable instructions comprise one or more programs for execution by a
processor such as the processor 5212 shown in the example processor platform 5200
discussed below in connection with FIG. 52. The program may be embodied in software
stored on a tangible computer readable storage medium such as a CD-ROM, a floppy disk, a
hard drive, a digital versatile disk (DVD), a Blu-ray disk, or a memory associated with the
processor 1012, but the entire program and/or parts thereof could alternatively be executed by
a device other than the processor 1012 and/or embodied in firmware or dedicated hardware.
Further, although the example program is described with reference to the flowcharts
illustrated in FIGS. 46-51, many other methods of implementing the example vehicle
alignment manager 450 may alternatively be used. For example, the order of execution of the
blocks may be changed, and/or some of the blocks described may be changed, eliminated, or
combined.
[0110] As mentioned above, the example processes of FIGS. 46-51 may be implemented
using coded instructions (e.g., computer and/or machine readable instructions) stored on a
tangible computer readable storage medium such as a hard disk drive, a flash memory, a
read-only memory (ROM), a compact disk (CD), a digital versatile disk (DVD), a cache, a
random-access memory (RAM) and/or any other storage device or storage disk in which
information is stored for any duration (e.g., for extended time periods, permanently, for brief
instances, for temporarily buffering, and/or for caching of the information). As used herein,
the term tangible computer readable storage medium is expressly defined to include any type
                                                - 23 -

of computer readable storage device and/or storage disk and to exclude propagating signals
and to exclude transmission media. As used herein, "tangible computer readable storage
medium" and "tangible machine readable storage medium" are used interchangeably.
Additionally or alternatively, the example processes of FIGS. 46-51 may be implemented
using coded instructions (e.g., computer and/or machine readable instructions) stored on a
non-transitory computer and/or machine readable medium such as a hard disk drive, a flash
memory, a read-only memory, a compact disk, a digital versatile disk, a cache, a random
access memory and/or any other storage device or storage disk in which information is stored
for any duration (e.g., for extended time periods, permanently, for brief instances, for
temporarily buffering, and/or for caching of the information). As used herein, the term non
transitory computer readable medium is expressly defined to include any type of computer
readable storage device and/or storage disk and to exclude propagating signals and to exclude
transmission media. As used herein, when the phrase "at least" is used as the transition term
in a preamble of a claim, it is open-ended in the same manner as the term "comprising" is
open ended.
[0111] The program 4600 of FIG. 46 begins at block 4602 where the example sensor system
interface 452 activates the sensor system(s) 64a and/or sensor system(s) 64b, as shown in the
illustrated examples of FIGS. 7-19. In the illustrated example of FIG. 46, the sensor system
64a and/or the sensor system 64b activated by the sensor system interface 452 produces a
beam-like projection 84 that, when broken and/or otherwise occluded by a portion of the
vehicle 12, generates a binary output. In some examples, the sensor system 64a generates a
logical TRUE value (e.g., voltage high, "1," etc.) when the projection 84 is unbroken, and a
logical FALSE value (e.g., voltage low, "0," etc.) when the projection 84 is broken. In other
examples, the logical output is reversed.
[0112] In some examples, pairs of sensors are employed to identify vehicles of different
sizes, in which some vehicles are wider than other vehicles. In the illustrated examples of
FIGS. 8-18, an outer sensor pair is employed to detect the lateral alignment of generally
wider examples of the vehicle 12 and an inner sensor pair is employed to detect the lateral
alignment of generally narrower examples of the vehicle 12. The example sensor interruption
manager 454 receives, retrieves and/or otherwise obtains an output signal from the example
inner sensor pair to determine whether the projection 84 is broken (block 4604). If the
projection 84of the inner sensor pair is not broken (block 4604) (e.g., only one projection 84
of one of the sensors 64' of the inner sensor pair of the example of FIGS. 14-18 is broken),
then the example alignment indicator manager 456 causes one or more displays 68 to
                                               - 24 -

generate an indication of misalignment in a manner consistent with the example of FIGS. 16
and 18 (block 4606). Additionally, the example alignment indicator manager 456 causes the
one or more displays 68 to generate detailed information regarding a manner of offset detail,
such as an indication that a driver of the vehicle 12 should adjust in a rightward direction (see
FIG. 16), or that the driver of the vehicle 12 should adjust in a leftward direction (see FIG.
18) (block 4606).
[0113] In the event that the vehicle 12 is identified as breaking and/or otherwise interrupting
the projection 84 for the inner sensor pair (block 4604), then the example sensor interruption
manager 454 determines whether one or more of the sensors of the outer sensor pair is
uninterrupted and/or otherwise not occluded by an object (block 4608). If both of the sensors
of the example outer sensor pair are unbroken in a manner consistent with the example of
FIGS. 9, 10 and 12, then the example alignment indicator manager 456 causes the one or
more displays 68 to generate an indication of alignment (block 4610). However, in the event
that one of the sensors of the outer sensor pair is blocked (block 4608), which is an indication
of a condition of misalignment as shown in example FIGS. 11 and 13, then the example
alignment indicator manager 456 causes the one or more displays 68 to generate an indication
of misalignment. Additionally, the example alignment indicator manager 456 causes the one
or more displays 68 to include detailed information regarding a manner of how the vehicle 12
is misaligned, thereby affording the driver an opportunity to apply corrective action(s). For
instance, the illustrated example of FIG. 11 illustrates the leftmost outer sensor 64' blocked
and the display 68a illuminates a left arrow light 88, while the illustrated example of FIG. 13
illustrates the rightmost outer sensor 64' blocked and the display 68a illuminates a right
arrow light 90. In operation, the example program 4600 of FIG. 46 may repeat as needed to
continually provide feedback to the operator of the vehicle 12 during one or more attempts to
dock.
[0114] The program 4700 of FIG. 47 begins at block 4702 where the example sensor system
interface 452 activates the sensor system(s) 64c, as shown in the illustrated examples of
FIGS. 20 and 21. In the illustrated example of FIG. 47, the sensor system 64c activated by
the sensor system interface 452 produces a beam-like projection 84 that generates feedback
indicative of a distance from an object occluding the beam-like projection 84. The example
sensor distance manager 458 determines whether a portion of the vehicle 12 (e.g., a first
lateral side 34, a second lateral side 36, a rear surface 32, a RIG 44, etc.) satisfies (e.g.,
remains below) a threshold distance value (block 4704). If so, then the example alignment
indicator manager 456 causes one or more displays 68 to generate an indication of alignment
                                                - 25 -

(block 4706), otherwise the example alignment indicator manager 456 generates an indication
of misalignment (block 4708). Additionally, the example alignment indicator manager 456
may generate additional detail and/or signals to cause the one or more displays 68 to convey
corrective action(s) to be taken by a driver of the vehicle 12 when misalignment occurs.
[0115] The program 4800 of FIG. 48 begins at block 4802 where the example sensor system
interface 452 activates the sensor system(s) 64d, as shown in the illustrated examples of
FIGS. 22 and 23. In the illustrated example of FIG. 48, the sensor system 64d includes an
electromechanical switch (e.g., a limit switch) that produces a binary feedback signal to
indicate a tripped condition or untripped condition. In some examples, a tripped condition is
represented by a logical TRUE signal (e.g., high voltage, "1," etc.) and an untripped
condition is represented by a logical FALSE signal (e.g., low voltage, "0," etc.). In some
examples, the sensor system 64d generates a feedback signal indicative of a linear amount by
which the switch is moved.
[0116] In the illustrated example of FIG. 48, the sensor system 64d produces a binary
feedback signal, and the sensor interruption manager 454 determines whether the actuator
102 is triggered (block 4804). If not, then the example alignment indicator manager 456
causes one or more displays 68 to generate an indication of alignment (block 4806). On the
other hand, in the event the example sensor interruption manager 454 determines that the
actuator 102 is triggered (block 4804), as shown in the illustrated example of FIG. 23, then
the example alignment indicator manager 456 causes one or more displays 68 to generate an
indication of misalignment (block 4808).
[0117] The program 4900 of FIG. 49 begins at block 4902 where the example sensor system
interface 452 activates the sensor system(s) 64e and/or sensor system(s) 64f, as shown in the
illustrated examples of FIGS. 24-26 and 29. In the illustrated example of FIG. 49, the
reference manager 460 queries the reference data store 462 to obtain a reference 110 (block
4904) to which feedback from sensor(s) may be compared to identify instances of alignment
and misalignment. As described above, an example reference 110 is shown in FIG. 24 to
include a horizontal axis 11 Ox and a vertical axis 1 Oy. The example reference manager 460
compares the acquired feedback signal from the example sensor system 64e (e.g., a video
signal) with the first axis of interest (block 4904), such as the horizontal axis 11 Ox, and
determines whether a violation occurs (block 4906). If no violation occurs (block 4906), then
the example alignment indicator manager 456 causes one or more displays 68 to generate an
indication of alignment (block 4908), and the example reference manager 460 determines
whether an additional axis of interest is to be checked for a violation (block 4910). If not,
                                                - 26 -

control returns to block 4904 to continue monitoring the first axis of interest. However, if the
example reference manager 460 determines that another axis of interest is to be checked
(block 4910), the example reference manager selects the next axis of interest (e.g., the
vertical axis 1Oy) (block 4912), and control returns to block 4906 to determine whether the
additional axis of interest invokes a violation condition. In the event the example reference
manager 460 identifies that any axis of interest causes a violation (block 4906), the example
alignment indicator manager 456 causes the one or more displays 68 to generate an indication
of misalignment in a manner consistent with the examples of FIGS. 27 and/or 28 (block
4914). As described above, monitoring programs, such as the example program 4900 of FIG.
49, may operate in a loop fashion to continuously monitor for alignment and/or misalignment
conditions during one or more attempts by a driver to dock the example vehicle 12.
[0118] The program 5000 of FIG. 50 begins at block 5002 where the example system
interface 452 activates the sensor system(s) 64g-i, as shown in the illustrated examples of
FIGS. 30-36. The sensor system(s) may employ any sensing technique such as, but not
limited to, video, still image, light sensors, arrays of sensors, etc. The example reference
manager 460 invokes the example reference data store 462 to acquire information (e.g., a
template) indicative of standardized component(s) that may be on the example vehicle 12.
As described above, standardized RIG devices may be constructed in a manner having
physical dimensions that are consistent across many vehicles. The example reference
manager 460 determines whether the sensor system(s) 64g-i match one or more standardized
equipment parameters (block 5004). If so, then the example reference manager 460
compares retrieved, received and/or otherwise obtained sensor data with orientation
thresholds relative to the identified standardized component (e.g., the RIG 44) (block 5006).
On the other hand, if one or more standardized components of the vehicle 12 are not
identified (block 5004), then the example reference manager 460 compares retrieved,
received and/or otherwise obtained sensor data with orientation thresholds relative to physical
features of the example vehicle 12, such as a rear surface (block 5008). In either case, the
reference manager 460 determines whether a violation occurs (block 5010). If not, the
example alignment indicator manager 456 causes one or more displays 68 to generate an
indication of alignment (block 5012). However, in the event the example reference manager
460 determines a violation (block 5010), the example alignment indicator manager 456
causes one or more displays 68 to generate an indication of misalignment (block 5014).
[0119] The program 5100 of FIG. 51 begins at block 5102, where the example sensor system
interface 452 activates the sensor system(s) 64g, as shown in the illustrated examples of
                                                 - 27 -

FIGS. 37-39. In the illustrated example of FIG. 51, the vehicle restraint interface 464
determines whether the vehicle 12 is restrained and/or otherwise locked to the loading dock
16 (block 5104). If not, the example program 5100 awaits for one or more indications that
the vehicle 12 is restrained, otherwise in response to an indication that the vehicle 12 is
restrained (block 5104), the example reference manager 460 scans for standardized
equipment that may be attached to or otherwise a part of the vehicle 12 (block 5106). In
some examples, if the vehicle 12 does not have one or more pieces of standardized
equipment, the example sensor system(s) 64g identify one or more reference points of the
example vehicle 12, such as a front edge 24.
[0120] When the reference point is identified (block 5106), the example sensor alignment
manager 466 identifies one or more reference point(s) (block 5108) and stores the associated
initial orientation information in the example reference data store 462 (block 5110). As
descried above, one or more aspects of the example vehicle 12 may change in response to
loading or unloading of the vehicle 12.
[0121] In the event the reference manager 460 identifies a change from the initial position of
the vehicle 12 (block 5112), the new position/orientation information (e.g., a distance in
inches) is compared to a threshold (block 5114), such as a threshold stored in the example
reference data store 462. If the example threshold value is satisfied (block 5114), the
example alignment indicator manager 456 causes one or more displays 68 to generate an
indication of alignment (block 5116). However, if the example threshold value is not
satisfied (e.g., exceeded) (block 5114), then the example alignment indicator manager 456
causes one or more displays 68 to generate an indication of misalignment (block 5118). In
some examples, the indication of misalignment may indicate an overload condition warning
message and/or a recommendation to remove some cargo. In other examples, the indication
of misalignment may indicate a recommendation to check and/or adjust a leveling suspension
system of the example vehicle 12 to accommodate for the excessive vertical change. If the
example vehicle restraint interface 464 determines that the vehicle 12 is still locked to the
loading dock 16 (block 5120), then control returns to block 5112 to continue to monitor for
changes in the orientation of the vehicle. However, when the example vehicle restraint
interface 464 determines that the vehicle 12 is unlocked from the loading dock 16 (block
5120), the example program 5100 ends.

benefits including, but not limited to, the following:
[0132] In some examples, a vehicle alignment system to monitor a vehicle at a loading dock
includes an inner sensor pair to detect a surface of the vehicle. In some such examples, the

A controller detects a threshold deviation in the spatial orientation of the detected surface of
the vehicle relative to the reference based on at least one of the first feedback signal of the

of the vehicle relative to the reference when a first sensor of the inner sensor pair is
interrupted and a second sensor of the inner sensor pair is uninterrupted.
[0134] In some examples, the second feedback signal provides an indication of a

feedback signal. In some examples, a display generates an indication representative of the
deviation in the lateral position of the RIG relative to the reference based on the feedback
