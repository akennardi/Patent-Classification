ABSTRACT
The invention relates generally to health tests and needs to examine
bodily fluids such as blood. A centrifuge comprises a sample chamber
(101), an opening (102) to an inner surface (103) of the sample
chamber and a contact part (104) for coupling the centrifuge to an
actuator (105). The centrifuge is configured to gather the heaviest
component of a bodily fluid sample into a sedimentation basin (106)
that is located on the utmost surface of the sample chamber from an
axis of rotation (107). The centrifuge further comprises flexible
material in the sample chamber 1) to use the sample chamber as a
pipette bulb such that its squeezing causes a suction force (108) to
obtain the bodily fluid sample into the sample chamber, or 2) to
accelerate a sedimentation of the bodily fluid sample by increasing a
distance (109) between the sedimentation basin and the axis of
rotation.

                           Centrifuge and system for bodily fluid sample
   Technical field: the present application relates generally to health tests and needs to
   examine bodily fluids, especially blood samples.
             Background of the invention
 5           In the past the most medical tests were performed in medical laboratories, which
   entailed sending specimens from a point of care and then waiting hours or days the results.
   It is forecasted that the in-vitro-diagnostics (IVD) and point-of-care (POC) testing are
   driving the health care markets. Another driving force is the importance of getting medical
   results faster. Many IVD tests can be used at the POC, or they are patient self-tests, and
10 some of them are rapid tests that give the results in a few minutes.
             In vivo refers to diagnostic tests conducted within a living organism. Conversely,
   in-vitro-diagnostics refers to tests that are conducted outside a living body. A blood
   glucose test is an example of the IVD test intended for patients with diabetes. Other IVD
   test examples are: a pregnancy test, an infectious disease test, and an STD (sexually
15 transmitted disease) test.
             Different bodily fluid samples are needed for IVD tests. The most common are
   blood or urine samples. For example, blood sampling is performed for tests or other
   procedures. Generally, blood sampling include arterial blood sampling, such as by radial
   artery puncture, capillary blood sampling (generally using a lancet), and venous blood
20 sampling in which blood samples are collected in capped test tubes.
             Numerous IVD tests are based on serum/plasma and the separation of whole
   blood into its components is required. Centrifugation is a well-known method by which
   plasma and serum is separated. The centrifugation is time consuming and requires heavy
   laboratory equipment. Additionally, the further processing and analysis requires multiple
25 steps where additional laboratory tasks are required. A drawback of the prior art is that
   centrifuges are expensive and slow from a point of view POC testing and self-testing.

                                                    2
             Various methods and devices for blood separation have been presented over the
   years. Diane L. et al, discusses many of these in US4933092. For example, a layer of glass
   fibres can be used to separate the blood components. Blood separation devices utilizing
   glass fibre membranes tend to separate serum at a relatively slow speed. Another drawback
 5 is that the glass fibre retains significant quantities of serum or plasma in the interstices of
   the membrane, which causes that the amount of a blood sample should relatively large.
             Regarding the specimen collection, bodily fluid analysation, and/or blood
   separation US2014/273187 discusses point of care sensor systems that include a portable
   reader and a disposable cartridge with a membrane or filter, W02003/060479 discusses a
10 sample testing device, buffer fluid, and a filter for holding a test strip, EP2684607
   discusses filters and fluid analysis cartridges, and US2005/232813 discusses filters and
   capillary tubes, and W02007/075922 discusses a portable sample analyser that includes a
   disposable fluidic cartridge.
             US4854933 describes a small-sized, cost-effective centrifuge for separating
15 plasma from a blood sample. The centrifuge is made of semi-rigid plastic in one piece, for
   example, by blow-moulding.
             Summary of the invention
             An objective of the invention is an apparatus for a fast blood component
20 separation. Another objective of the invention is that the serum or plasma included in a
   blood sample can be utilized in point-of-care testing. Another objective of the invention is
   a small-sized, easy and fast to use, and/or cost-effective centrifuge and the centrifuge
   based system for self-tests and other (health) tests. In addition to blood, the tests may be
   based on other bodily fluids: saliva, urine, perspiration, tears, sperm, or interstitial fluid.
25           The invention concerns a centrifuge for a bodily fluid sample. A single bodily
   fluid sample can be immediately tested when it is obtained. In one embodiment of the
   invention the centrifuge resembles a pipette such that its sample chamber is used a pipette
   bulb. In more detail, by squeezing the sample chamber and then releasing it the bodily
   fluid sample is obtained into the sample chamber.

                                                  3
            In one embodiment, flexible material of the sample chamber results in that a
   sedimentation basin recedes from a rotation axis and thus a radius of the rotation increases
   and accelerates the sedimentation of the bodily fluid sample.
            The centrifuge comprises
 5          a sample chamber for receiving the bodily fluid sample through an opening to an
   inner surface of the sample chamber and
            a contact part for coupling the centrifuge to an actuator and
            the centrifuge is configured to gather the heaviest component of the bodily fluid
   sample into a sedimentation basin when a rotation caused by the actuator affect the
10 centrifuge, the sedimentation basin locating on the utmost surface of the sample chamber
   from an axis of rotation.
            The centrifuge further comprises
            flexible material in the sample chamber for at least one of the following purposes:
   1) to use the sample chamber as a pipette bulb such that squeezing of the sample chamber
15 causes a suction force to obtain the bodily fluid sample from the opening into the sample
   chamber, 2) to accelerate a sedimentation of the bodily fluid sample by increasing a
   distance between the sedimentation basin and the axis of rotation.

             Detailed description of the invention
             It is appreciated that the following embodiments are exemplary. Although the
10 specification may refer to "one" or "some" embodiment(s), the reference is not necessarily
   made to the same embodiment(s), or the feature in question may apply to multiple
   embodiments. Single features of different embodiments may be combined to provide
   further embodiments.
             Let us assume that there is a motor or an actuator to provide the required
15 circulation force to a separator. There may be a vent hole, i.e. an opening, on the side of
   the separator to insert fluid to the separator and/or take the separated fluid, such as blood
   component, out of the separator. Alternatively the vent hole may be on the center of the
   separator. The separator can be also termed a centrifuge.
             FIG. 1 shows a cross-section of a centrifuge 100 that is configured to separate a
20 component of a bodily fluid sample. Blood is an example of the bodily fluid sample and
   serum/plasma is an example of the component. Generally speaking, centrifuge 100 is
   intended for at least one of the following bodily fluid samples: blood, saliva, urine,
   perspiration, tears, sperm, or interstitial fluid. Centrifuge 100 comprises a sample chamber
   101 for receiving the bodily fluid sample through an opening 102 so that the bodily fluid
25 sample touches an inner surface 103 of sample chamber 101 and rests against inner surface
   103 in the sample chamber. Centrifuge 100 can be implemented in various manners and
   thus, for example, a location of opening 102 is not defined in Fig. 1.

                                                    5
             Centrifuge 100 may be small-sized and its diameter is, for example, two cm.
   Centrifuge 100 is intended for a single bodily fluid sample. It is possible to receive the
   sample to centrifuge 100 immediately after taking the sample.
             Centrifuge 100 further comprises a contact part 104 for coupling sample chamber
 5  101 to an actuator 105. Contact part 104 may be a hole in centrifuge 100. In Figure 1
   contact part 104 is a protrusion that fits into a counterpart of actuator 105 and a friction
   keeps it in the counterpart.
             Actuator 105 may be a hand-hold apparatus that can rotate sample chamber 101
   fast enough about contact part 104 to cause the sedimentation in the bodily fluid sample
10 (details of actuator 105 are omitted from the figure).
             Centrifuge 100 further comprises a sedimentation basin 106 for gathering the
   heaviest component of the body fluid sample when actuator 105 is coupled to contact part
    104 and rotates sample chamber 101. The heaviest component has the greatest mass per
   unit volume compared to the other component(s) included in the body fluid sample. The
15 rotation of sample chamber 101 causes the sedimentation that separates the heaviest
   component, such as blood cells, from the bodily fluid sample. Sedimentation basin 106
   locates inside sample chamber 101 on the utmost surface from an axis of rotation 107 (axis
   of rotation 107 is illustrated with a dashed line).
             Contact part 104 is positioned in relation to sample chamber 101 so that axis of
20 rotation 107 penetrates it and sample chamber 101 and enables a rotation of sample
   chamber 101 in a balanced manner or an unbalanced manner. Because centrifuge 100 is
   lightweight, it can be safely rotated even in the unbalanced manner so that the separation of
   the components of the bodily fluid sample is successful.
             Centrifuge 100 further comprises flexible material for at least one of the two
25 following purposes. The first purpose is to use sample chamber 101 as a pipette bulb such
   that squeezing of sample chamber 101 causes a suction force 108 to obtain the bodily fluid
   sample into sample chamber 101.

                                                    6
             The second purpose of centrifuge 100 is to accelerate sedimentation of the bodily
   fluid sample by increasing a distance 109 between sedimentation basin 106 and axis of
   rotation 107 when centrifuge 100 is rotated by actuator 105.
             In one embodiment sample chamber 101 comprises a coating on inner surface
 5  103. One purpose for the coating is to prevent the chemicals of plastic to react with the
   bodily fluid sample and contaminate the sample, if sample chamber 101 is made of plastic.
   Another purpose for the coating is to prevent a clotting of blood.
             Still another purpose for the coating of inner surface 103 of sample chamber 101
   is to prevent the (blood) sample to grip to inner surface 103 of sample chamber 101,
10 because the amount of the sample may be tiny, only few drops, and thus the sample should
   be carefully utilized to obtain reliable test results. Teflon may be an appropriate substance
   to make the coating slippery. A layer of liquid perfluorocarbon is another substance to
   reduce the friction of the coating, especially TLP (tethered-liquid perfluorocarbon)
   developed at Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).
15           In one embodiment centrifuge 100 is reusable. In more detail, centrifuge 100 and
   its sample chamber 101 are cleanable with a liquid. The liquid may be pure water or it may
   contain a cleaning/sterilizing substance. In one embodiment centrifuge 100 is a disposable
   centrifuge such that centrifuge 100 is intended to be used only once.
             FIG. 2 shows in four views centrifuge 100 implemented as a pipette type
20 centrifuge. In this embodiment centrifuge has 100 the both above-mentioned purposes: 1)
   to use the sample chamber 100 as a pipette bulb and 2) to accelerate sedimentation of the
   bodily fluid sample. In one embodiment centrifuge 100 has a strengthened structure
   between sample chamber 100 and opening 102 in order to tolerate the rotation. In one
   embodiment the structure is strengthened by increasing a thickness of a centrifuge wall.

    100. Opening 102 is here a pipette opening and sample chamber 100 is a pipette bulb such
   that the squeezing (two force vectors in view 'Al') causes a temporary vacuum inside
   sample chamber 100 and aspiring of a blood drop from a finger's surface happens by
   allowing sample chamber 100 to enlarge to its original size.

             View 'A2' illustrates centrifuge 100 when blood drops are received into sample
   chamber 101 and centrifuge 100 is attached to a bit adapter 200 of an actuator. The
   actuator is, for example, a drill and bit adapter 200 is, for example, an adapter that can be
   screwed in relation to the actuator to move three bits included in the adapter. Those three
 5 bits press centrifuge 100 at its opening 102.
             View 'B' illustrates centrifuge 100 when it is rotated at a full speed with the
   actuator. The rotation has caused distance 109 between sedimentation basin 106 of
   centrifuge 100 and axis of rotation 107. View 'B' provides a cross-section of sample
   chamber 101 such that line between utmost circumference 201 of sample chamber 101 and
10 opening 102 represents surface 202 of a blood sample. Ovals in sample chamber 101
   represent blood cells 203 which are ended due to the sedimentation into sedimentation
   basin 106. The rest portion of the blood sample, i.e. plasma 204, is located between blood
   cells 203 and surface 202 of the blood sample.
             View 'C' illustrates centrifuge 100 when the rotation has been stopped. Blood
15 cells 203 are located nearest a pipette body 205 that is a tubular part of centrifuge 100
   between sample chamber 101 and opening 102. Blood cells 203 can be squeezed through
   pipette body 205 and opening 102 out of centrifuge 100. Therefore, centrifuge 100 enables
   taking a sample of blood cells.
             FIG. 3 shows in fours views centrifuge 100, wherein centrifuge 100 comprises an
20 attachment point 301 for attaching centrifuge 100 to a rotation axle.
             View 'A' illustrates aspirating a blood drop from a finger into centrifuge 100. A
   person has stopped squeezing sample chamber 101 and suction force 108 causes aspirating
   of a blood drop from a finger's surface into opening 102 of centrifuge 100. A pipette body
   302 is a centrifuge part that is located between opening 102 and sample chamber 101.
25           View 'B' illustrates centrifuge 100 when sample chamber 101 has enlarged to its
   normal size and includes a bodily fluid sample 304 (blood). Before attaching centrifuge
   100 a person has turned it such that sample chamber 101 is located closer to the earth than
   opening 102 of centrifuge 100. Then the person has pushed an axle 303 of actuator 105
   into attachment point 301 which is in this example a pipe.

             View 'C' illustrates rotating the pipette type of centrifuge by actuator 105. Pipette
   body 302 is so rigid that rotating of centrifuge 100 does not substantially affect distance
   109 between sedimentation basin 106 and axis of rotation 107.
             View 'D' illustrates the situation after the sedimentation of bodily fluid sample
 5 304. The person can detach centrifuge 100 from axle 303 and then squeeze sides 305, 306
   to force a light component 307 of bodily fluid sample 304 out of centrifuge 100.
             Pipette body 302 is in this example arranged about 45 degrees angle in relation to
   a horizontal level. Pipette body 302 (or pipette body 205) can be arranged in 0-90 degrees
   angle in relation to the horizontal level. In one embodiment pipette body 302 is parallel
10 with the horizontal level to avoid a bending force at attachment point 301.
             In one embodiment attachment point 301 is the pipe penetrating pipette body 302.
   In another embodiment attachment point 301 is located outside of pipette body 302.
             FIG. 4 shows in five views of centrifuge 100, wherein centrifuge 100 is
   implemented as a disc type of centrifuge.
15           View 'A' illustrates receiving a blood sample in sample chamber 101. A person's
   finger 401 is located on top of opening 102 and a blood drop 402.
             View 'B1'   illustrates a situation in which opening 102 is closed with a stopper
   403 to prevent a spilling of the blood sample and sample chamber 101 is rotating at full
   speed. Due to the flexible material, sedimentation basin 106 has slightly receded from the
20 axis of rotation (not shown). Stopper 403 is, for example, a plug with a little rod 404 to
   grip with fingers. Blood cells 203 are ended due to the sedimentation into sedimentation
   basin 106, i.e. to the sides of sample chamber 101. Stopper 403 keeps the sample inside the
   centrifuge 100 and it further prevents the blood sample from drying when actuator 105
   rotates centrifuge 100. Another purpose for stopper 403 is that it remains sample chamber
25 101 sterile from the manufacturing of centrifuge 100 to usage of it. Still another purpose
   for stopper 403 is that it keeps a special gel (for blood) in sample chamber 101. Basically,
   it is possible to use centrifuge 100 without a stopper on opening 102, if the amount of the
   bodily fluid sample is small enough. In more detail, the stopper could be omitted, if the
   bodily fluid sample does not reach opening 102 within the rotation.

             View 'B2' illustrates from a bird's perspective when sample chamber 101 is
   rotating at full speed. A circle between utmost circumference 201 of sample chamber 101
   and opening 102 represents surface 202 of a blood sample. The centrifugal force affects so
   that the blood sample is located in sedimentation basin 106 which is in this embodiment of
 5 centrifuge utmost surface 201 from axis of rotation 107. Ovals in sample chamber 101
   represent blood cells 203 and they form one component of the blood sample and said
   component has a greater mass per unit volume than the rest portion of the blood sample.
   The rest portion of the blood sample, including plasma 204, is located between blood cells
   203 and surface 202 of the blood sample.
10           View 'C' illustrates a situation in which centrifuge 100 is stopped and due to the
   gravitation, blood cells 203 are dropped to the bottom of sample chamber 101. In this
   embodiment the bottom part of sample chamber 101 operates as a bottom basin 405 for
   storing the heaviest component. Thus, blood cells 203 end into bottom basin 405 when the
   sedimentation has reached a predetermined level and centrifuge 100 is stopped.
15           View 'D' illustrates taking plasma 406 from sample chamber 101. A person has
   removed stopper 403 and pushed the end of a pipette 407 through opening 102. In one
   embodiment centrifuge 100 comprises transparent material to provide a view into
   centrifuge 100. In one embodiment centrifuge 100 is made of transparent material so that
   the person can see through centrifuge 100 the upper surface of plasma 406 and the
20 boundary surface between plasma 406 and blood cells 203 and therefore the person can
   target the end of pipette 407 into plasma 406. It is possible to provide such air pressure to
   the end of pipette 407 that plasma 406 does not enter into pipette 407. When the end of
   pipette 407 is in the layer of blood cells 203 the person stops squeezing, and allows the
   bulb of pipette 407 to enlarge, to take blood cells 203 into pipette 407. Thus, the invention
25 is not limited to the use of the lightest layer of the bodily fluid sample but the other layer(s)
   of the sample can be examined, too.
             View 'D' further illustrates a sample plane 408. Sample plane 408 is a part of the
   bottom of sample chamber 101 locating higher from the earth than bottom basin 405. A
   benefit of (the disc type of) centrifuge 100 is that bottom basin 405 keeps blood cells, or
30 other heaviest components out of sample plane 408 leaving sample plane 408 for a light

                                                   10
   component. Then it is easier for the person to take only the light component into pipette
   407. In more detail, the person can touch to the sample plane 408 with the end of pipette
   407 and get a haptic feedback that the end is in plasma 406.

   100 is shaped so that it can rotate on axis of rotation 107 as fast as possible. A benefit of
   (the propeller type of) centrifuge 100 is that a long radius 501 of the rotation accelerates
   effectively the sedimentation of a bodily fluid sample.
10           View 'C' shows a cross-section of the propeller type of centrifuge 100 from the
   side of centrifuge 100 when the rotation is stopped. The ends of (the propeller type of)
   centrifuge 100 are twisted downwards (towards the earth). Due to the flexible or bendable
   material a distance between sedimentation basin 106 and axis of rotation 107 can vary, i.e.
   a rotation of sample chamber 101 causes sedimentation basin 106 to recede from axis of
15 rotation 107. Various types of plastics and rubber are appropriate materials to be used as
   the flexible material in centrifuge 100 and in sample chamber 101.
             In view 'C' the sedimentation of a bodily fluid sample has happened and the
   heaviest component 502 of the bodily fluid sample has ended due to the gravity to the
   bottom of sample chamber 101.
20           FIG. 6A shows a counterpart 601 for coupling centrifuge 100 to actuator 105.
   Contact part 104 and counterpart 601 include threads for attaching and detaching them
   from each other such that threads 602 are formed onto contact part 104 and threads 603 are
   formed onto actuator 105. This kind actuator coupling can be used, for example, with
   centrifuge 100 shown in Fig. 5.
25           A bit adapter 200 (in Fig. 2) is another example of counterpart 601. In one
   embodiment, as illustrated in Fig. 3, axle 303 is intended to be used as counterpart 601.

                                                   11
             FIG. 6B shows actuator 105 equipped with an electric motor 611. Actuator 105 is
   size of an electric toothbrush and has a similar a loadable accumulator 612. Electric motor
   611 can rotate axle 303 that is in one embodiment firmly attached to counterpart 601. The
   components of the bodily fluid sample may remix together, if centrifuge 100 stops too
 5 rapidly after the sedimentation. Therefore, in one embodiment of centrifuge 100 the
   rotational speed of actuator 100 is adjustable to avoid a remixing of the components. This
   feature can be implemented by using a motor control, for example, a pulse-width
   modulation (PWM).
             The motor control is advantageous, if the components of the bodily fluid sample
10 will easily remix. If the remixing does not happen easily, actuator 105 can be an on/off
   type of actuator. When actuator 105 is turned from the on state to the off state, the friction
   finally stops the rotation of centrifuge 100. It is recommendable to hold centrifuge 100 and
   actuator 105 on a horizontal plane (a table) to avoid the remixing.
             FIG. 7 shows a nomogram 700 for centrifuge 100. Nomogram 700 comprises a
15 scale 701 for RFC, a scale 702 for RPM, and a scale 703 for Radius, i.e. the rotation radius
   of centrifuge 100. The terms RFC, RPM, and Radius are explained and a formula for RPM
   is shown in the following:
                  RCF     = relative centrifugal force (g)
                  RPM     = centrifuge speed in
                             revolutions per minute
                  Radius = distance in mm from center of
                             centrifuge spindle to bottom of
                             Amicon device when in rotor
                                ORCF                     =RPM
                   (1.118x10*)     (Radius in mm)
             A dashed line 704 gives an example of use of nomogram 700. Dashed line 704
20 discloses that in order to exceed RFC value 500 RPM value should be more than 2500 and
   Radius should be about 75 mm.
             Numerous IVD tests are based on serum/plasma and the separation of whole
   blood into its components is thus required. In the prior art the centrifugation is time
   consuming and requires heavy laboratory equipment. Additionally, the further processing
25 and analysis requires multiple steps where additional laboratory tasks are required. Those

                                                   12
   laboratory tasks can be avoided by using centrifuge 100. Let as assume that centrifuge 100
   rotates with a required RCF value, such as 1200 (1000-1500 is commonly used in 10 min
   separation) to separate the blood into components. The required RPM (revolutions per
   minute) can be approximated with the nomogram 700, or it can be calculated more
 5 precisely with the formula shown in the above. The required RPM with 1200 RCF is
   approximately 10100 when the radius of the separator is 1 cm.
             FIG. 8 shows a system 800 intended for testing or analysing at least one body
   fluid sample. Previous Figs. 2-5 show some examples of centrifuge 100. Centrifuge 100 is
   included in the all embodiments of system 800 but the rest of components 801-803 are
10 optional, i.e. they are not necessarily included in system 800.
             A sample input device is intended for inputting the bodily fluid sample through
   opening 102 to sample chamber 101. A capillary pipe 801 is an example of the sample
   input device and a pipette and an injection needle are other examples.
             A benefit of centrifuge 100 shown in Fig. 2 (the pipette type of centrifuge) and
15 centrifuge 100 shown in Fig. 3 (the pipette with an attachment point) is that there is no
   need for an additional sample input device, because centrifuge 100 is intended to be used
   as the sample input device, i.e. as a pipette.
             A test cassette 802 is intended for testing a component of the bodily fluid sample
   (the test cassette is also termed a test device in the prior art).
20           A component transfer device is intended for transferring the component of the
   bodily fluid sample into test cassette 802. Capillary pipe 801, pipette 407, and the injection
   are examples of the component transfer device, or generally speaking, they are examples of
   a part 803 for moving the bodily fluid sample or its component.
             Test cassette 802 comprises a well 804 into which the component to be tested is
25 transferred with the component transfer device. A side of well 804 includes an aperture
   (not shown) through which the component can enter inside test cassette 802.

                                                  13
              Test cassette 802 further comprises an indicator 805 for indicating a test result.
   Indicator 805 shows to a person whether the test result is positive or negative. In addition
   or alternative, the indicator 805 shows to the person whether the test succeeded, i.e. the test
   result is reliable. The test cassettes are known devices and they have been manufactured
 5 for various purposes. Allergy tests, a pregnancy test, and an alcohol test are some examples
   of tests in which the test cassettes and system 800 can be used. The alcohol test is also an
   example of the saliva test. The invention is not limited to blood sample tests.
              Centrifuge 100 may be a part of various systems 800. Centrifuge 100 and system
   800 may be utilized in the IVD or POC testing but they can be utilized also in hospitals, for
10 example. Persons of systems 800 may be (health care) professionals, pharmacists, or
   common people. Parts of system 800 can be packed with instructions into a carton box.
               Centrifuge 100 may be a part of a large (health care) system that comprises a
   processor and a memory. In one embodiment system 800 is capable to a lab-on-chip
   analysis and communication through a person interface, for example, with a person taking
15 the sample.
              In one embodiment system 800 is capable to provide the test results/analysis to
   (health care) persons, devices, or services locally, or over a network.
              While the present invention has been described in connection with a number of
   exemplary embodiments, and implementations, the present invention is not so limited, but
20 rather covers various modifications, and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the
   purview of the prospective claims.
