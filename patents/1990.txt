                                           ABSTRACT
A medical/surgical lavage unit that includes a tip assembly with an irrigation tube and a
suction tube. The irrigation tube is disposed within and axially offset from the suction tube.
The suction tube has a lumen with a relatively wide cross-sectional length that reduces
clogging of waste in the lumen.

     MEDICAL/SURGICAL LAVAGE UNIT WITH A TIP ASSEMBLY THAT
  INCLUDES AN IRRIGATION TUBE DISPOSED INSIDE A       SUCTION TUBE
         AND THAT IS AXIALLY OFFSET FROM THE SUCTION TUBE
[0001]       The entire content of the complete specification of Australian
  Patent Application No. 2013355202 as originally filed is incorporated
herein by reference.
                       Field of the Invention
 [0001A]     This invention relates generally to a lavage unit
that simultaneously discharges irrigation fluid to a body
site and draws material from the site.        More particularly,
the lavage unit of this invention has       features to minimize
the clogging of the material withdrawn from the site.
                    Background of the Invention
[0002]       In many surgical and medical procedures, a lavage
unit is    employed to deliver fluid to a particular location
on or in the body of a person receiving medical attention.
For example, during orthopedic surgery, a lavage unit may be
employed to deliver pressurized pulses of water or saline
solution to an exposed surface of the bone in order to clean
the bone. There are also some non-surgical procedures
performed which likewise make it desirable to apply pulses
of water to a specific site on an individual's skin. Thus,
if an individual is suffering from some type of bed sore or
some other type of skin wound, it is       a common practice to
use a lavage unit to clean the wound prior to applying a
dressing to the wound.
[0003]       A common type of medical/surgical lavage unit
includes a handpiece to which a tip assembly is        selectively
attached. Often, inside the handpiece is a small pump that
periodically delivers a quantity of pressurized fluid.
Alternatively, the pressurized fluid is delivered to the
handpiece from an external pump. The fluid is discharged
through a discharge tube integral with the tip assembly to
the selected site on or in the patient. These lavage units
deliver fluid in pressurized pulses       for two reasons. One
                                   1

reason is that fluid pulses quickly strike the site to which
they are applied and leave the site;  this action serves to
foster the desirable removal of debris from the site.
Secondly, the discrete fluid pulses do not obstruct the view
of the site as much as it can be obstructed when exposed to
a continuous flow of pressurized fluid.
[0004]     Most lavage units, in addition to having a conduit
through which the sterile fluid is discharged, have a
conduit through which the discharged fluid is removed from
the site to which it is applied. Typically, the fluid is
initially withdrawn from the site through a suction tube,
also part of the tip assembly. The fluid, as well as any
debris in the fluid stream, then flow through a conduit
integral with the handpiece. The handpiece suction conduit
is connected to a second suction tube that is connected to a
suction system separate from the irrigator. Thus, given
their ability to essentially simultaneously clean a site on
a patient and remove the debris generated by the cleaning
process, it should be readily apparent why irrigators have
become useful tools for facilitating many medical and
surgical procedures.
[0005]     Further, it is the common practice to manufacture
both the handpiece and tip assembly of lavage unit as use
once items.   One reason these units are use-once is
economics.   The cost of forming these devices out of
sterilizable components and then sterilizing the devices
after each use can be greater than the cost of providing a
quantity of use-once device.   A second reason these units
are use-once items is  related to weight.  The weights of
components  forming a handpiece manufactured to be
sterilizable are greater than the weights  of comparable
components  forming a use-once handpiece.  During a
procedure,  such as bone cleaning, it may be necessary to
hold the lavage unit steady for time periods that run into
                               2

the minutes.   Making the lavage unit as light as possible
reduces the muscle fatigue of the individual required to
hold the unit steady for an extended periods of time.
[0006]     Applicant's US Pats. No.  6,022,329 and No.
7,153,287, both of which are explicitly incorporated herein
by reference, disclose use-once lavage units.    In these
patents and in other publications, lavage units are
sometimes referred to as irrigators.
[0007]     The lavage units of the incorporated by reference
patents work reasonably well.    Still, sometimes with these
lavage units, as well as other lavage units the suction
tubes  integral with the tip assemblies clog with debris.
This means use of the unit has to be interrupted in order to
either clear the clog or to attach a replacement tip
assembly.   Taking the time to perform either of these
procedures runs contrary to the goal   of modern medical
practice, that a procedure should be performed as quickly as
possible so as to minimize the time the patient is both held
under anesthesia or has internal body tissue that is   exposed
to the ambient environment.
[0008]     Further as with any product, there is  always a
desire to hold the costs of product to a minimum.    One area
in which this has  affected lavage handpiece design is the
trigger.   The trigger is the manual member the practitioner
depresses to selectively actuate the pump motor.    In some
situations,  the practitioner may want to rapidly control the
on/off discharging of the lavage fluid by the pump.    When
this type of control is required, the trigger needs to
operate as a momentary contact switch.    In some situations
the practitioner may want the pump to remain on for an
extended period of time, 30  seconds or more.  If the trigger
is of the momentary contact variety, the practitioner has    to
exert mental and physical effort ensuring the trigger
remains in the on state, the trigger should operate as a
                               3

switch that is selectively toggled on and off.     This is a
reason why it would be useful to provide a lavage unit with
a toggle switch that   is toggled between the on and off
states.   However, sometimes, in same procedure the
practitioner may want the trigger to function as both as
momentary contact switch on one phase of the procedure and,
in another phase of the procedure, as a toggle switch.      To
date it has proven difficult to provide a use-once lavage
handpiece with a trigger that can operate both as a contact
switch and a toggle switch.
                    Summary of the  Invention
[0009]     This invention is  directed to a new and useful
lavage unit.   The lavage unit of this invention includes
both a handpiece with a pump and a tip assembly that extends
distally forward from the handpiece.
[00010]    Both the handpiece and tip assembly of this
invention are formed to reduce the likelihood that debris
entrained in the suction flow from patient clog the suction
flow path.   Specifically, the tip assembly includes an
irrigation tube disposed inside the suction tube.     These two
tubes,  and their complementary lumens are not coaxial.     This
feature of the invention increases the cross section
distance of the axes of the suction lumen.     Internal  to the
handpiece the suction path includes a pair of bores.      These
bores are axially offset.    Further these bores are not
circular.   These bores overlap is such a way as to present a
relatively wide flow through path.     This feature of the
invention both reduces the likelihood of clogging and the
low cost manufacture of the pump.
[00011]    The handpiece of this invention includes a multi
position trigger.   Normally, the trigger is in the off
state.   The trigger can be displaced an initial   distance.
When the trigger is displaced the initial distance,     the
                                4

trigger functions as a momentary contact switch;   the release
of the trigger immediately returns the trigger to the off
state.  The trigger can also be displaced a second distance
that is greater than the first distance.    When the trigger
is displaced the second distance, the trigger engages a
complementary stop.   The trigger stays in static on state
position.   The handpiece pump remains in the on state until
an addition effort is made to displace the trigger.    The
displacement of the trigger to the third position returns
the trigger to the off state.    Thus the trigger of this
invention operates as both a momentary contact switch and a
toggle switch that can be set to a constant on state or
constant off state.
[00012]   In some but not all versions of the invention, the
displacement of the trigger to the second position causes
the trigger to engage and be held in position by a stop.
The stop in some versions of the invention is a feature
formed in one of the shell members from which the housing of
the handpiece is  formed.

                      Detailed Description
I.    Overview
[00052]    Figures 1-3 depict the basic components of a
lavage unit 50 of this invention.       Lavage unit 50 includes a
handpiece 64 to which a tip assembly 650      is removably
attached.   An irrigation tube 56 runs from a source of
irrigating fluid 54 to the handpiece 64.       A suction tube 66
is mounted to the handpiece 64.      Suction tube  66 extends
proximally to both a waste collection container 63 and a
suction source 61.    (Here "proximally" means towards the
practitioner holding handpiece 64,      away from the patient to
which the tip assembly 650   is applied.     "Distally" means
away from the practitioner and towards the patient.)
Internal to the handpiece 64 is     a pump 420  to which the
distal end of irrigation tube 56 is connected.       Pump 420  is
driven by a motor 360.    The on/off state of the motor 360      is
controlled by a trigger 561   that is pivotally mounted to the
underside of the handpiece 64.      The speed at which the motor
360  and, by extension the rate at which pump 420     operates,
is  controlled by a speed setting switch 562.      Switch 562  is
slidably mounted to the proximal end of the handpiece      64.
[00053]    Tip assembly 650  includes a rigid irrigation
tube 750,  seen in Figure 28.    Irrigation tube   750 is
disposed inside a suction tube     730.   A spray shield 770  is
removably disposed over suction tube 730.       When the tip
assembly 650 is attached to the handpiece 64,      a first fluid
                                 8

communication path is established between the outlet port of
pump 420   and irrigation tube 750.     A  second fluid
communication path is established between the proximal end
of suction tube    730 and suction tube 66 that is    attached to
and extends from the handpiece 64.
II.    Handpiece
[00054]     Handpiece 64 includes a right and left shells      70
and 210,   respectively, as seen in Figures 4 and 5.
Collectively, shells     70 and 210 form the housing or body of
the handpiece    64.   The shells 70  and 210 have proximal and
distal sections that have proximal to distal longitudinal
axes that are not linear.      Thus, the proximal sections of
the shells collectively form a handgrip 65 of handpiece 64.
The distal sections of the shells collectively form a
barrel   67 of the handpiece 64.     Shells 70  and 210 are formed
out of plastic such as ABS.
[00055]     As  seen in Figures 5 and 6, right shell 70    is
formed so as to have a base 69.       A rectangular notch 72   in
the proximalmost     rim, rim 71, of the shell 70.    Two brackets
74  and 78 extend upwardly from the shell base so as to
partially extend into the space internal to shell 70
subtended by notch 72.      Bracket 74,   as seen in Figure 6A, is
L-shaped in that it has a minor portion that extends
distally inwardly from the shell proximalmost rim 71.
Brackets 74    and 78 are generally planar.     At the ends of
brackets 74    and 78 adjacent each other each bracket 74 and
78  is  formed with a step 75   and 79, respectively.    Each step
75  and 79 is   located distally forward of the bracket 74 and
78,  respectively, from which the step extends.       A rib 76 and
80 protrudes proximally from each step 75       and 79,
respectively.     Ribs 76 and 80 are convex in shape.     It
should be understood that     steps 75 and 79 are spaced apart
from each other.
                                  9

[00056]       Forward of steps 75 and 79 two bosses 84 extend
upwardly from the inner surface of the shell base.                                 Each
boss   84 is    formed with a closed end bore                        (not identified).
Bosses 84 are located towards the upper rim, rim 83                                of the
shell   70.     A boss 86 extends upwardly from the inner surface
of the shell base.              Boss 86 is         located below and distally
forward of bosses 84.                A closed end bore               (not identified)
extends inwardly from the exposed face of boss 86.
[00057]       Four ribs          88,   92,    96,   and 102 extend upwardly from
the shell base.            Ribs 88,        92,   96,   and 102        are located
forward of boss 86.                The ribs      88,   92,    96 and 102 are
generally parallel to each other and extend laterally across
the shell base,          from a location adjacent the top of the
shell towards the lower rim 139.                       Rib 88       is formed to have
two spaced apart tabs 90 that extend upwardly from the main
body of the rib.            Between tabs           90,  rib 88 has a top surface
 (not identified) that is concave in shape.                              Each of ribs 92
and 96 has an inwardly curved face such that the face serves
as the base of a notch defined by the rib                             (faces and notches
not identified).            Rib 102 generally protrudes above the
inwardly curved faces of ribs                    92 and 96.           Rib 102 is    further
formed to have a U-shaped notch                      (not identified).
[00058]       Two     bosses        106    and    108    extend        upwardly    from   the
shell   base.       Bosses        106   and    108    are   both       located   forward   of
rib 102.       Boss 106         is   located       towards        the    upper  rim   of  the
shell   70.      The boss         108   is    located     towards        the  lower   rim of
the   shell    70.       Boss       108    is    smaller       in    diameter     than   boss
106.      Both    bosses        106    and     108    are   formed        with  closed    end
bores,      (not   identified).               Boss    108   is      of   smaller    diameter
than boss     106.
[00059]       Forward of bosses 106 and 108,                        the right shell 70
is  formed with a boss 110.                   Boss 110     is located between and
distally forward of bosses                   106 and 108.           The boss    110 is
formed with a closed end bore,                     (not identified).            Four
                                                10

equiangularly spaced apart reinforcing webs 112 project
radially outwardly from the outer surface of the boss 110.
The webs 112  taper downwardly from the outer face of the
boss  110.  The webs 112 extend to a ring 114 that extends
upwardly from the inner surface of the base of shell 70.
The ring 114  extends above the surface of shell 70 a
distance less than the distance boss 110 extends above the
shell.
[00060]    A bracket 122, seen best in Figure 6B,     is  also
integrally formed with the right shell 70.       The bracket 122
seats on three parallel bars 118    that project outwardly from
the inner surface to the shell    70.   Bars 118 and bracket 122
are both located between and below boss      108 and boss 110.
The bracket 122  is generally elongated shaped structure such
that the major axis of the bracket, the longitudinal axis,
extends along a line that extends between the lower and
upper rims of the shell.   Bracket 122    is  formed so the lower
end of the bracket has  a convex shaped bottom surface 124.
Extending proximally and upwardly from surface 124 the
bracket has  a first proximal side surface 126 that generally
tapers proximally and upwardly away from surface 124.        Above
surface 126,  the bracket has a second proximal side
surface 128  that is convex in shape.     Side surface 128 thus
defines a notch in the bracket 122.      Above surface 128,    the
bracket is  shaped to define a step surface 130.      The step
surface 130 extends generally distally forward from the
outer top edge of the second side surface 128.       Step
surface 130  is concave in shape.     The bracket 122 is   further
formed to have a third proximal side surface 132.        The third
proximal side surface 132 extends upwardly and proximally
away from the distal end of step surface 130.       The third
proximal side surface 132 merges into a top surface 134.
The top surface 134 is  generally semicircular in shape.        A
                               11

distal side surface, surface 136,       extends downwardly from
top surface 134 to bottom surface 124.
[00061]     Below and forward of bracket 122,     the lower
rim 139 of the right side shell 70 is       formed to define an
elongated notch 140.      Notch 140   is present where the shell
bends  from forming the grip portion 67 of the handpiece to
the barrel portion 65.       Proximal to notch 140 a pin 135
extends upwardly from shell base 69.        Pin 135   is spaced
inwardly from the lower rim 139 of the shell.          A J-shaped
bracket 137 extends outwardly from the shell base         69.
Bracket 137    substantially but not completely surrounds
pin 135.    Right side shell 70 is     shaped so that bracket 137
does not surround the distally facing surface of pin 135.
[00062]     Above notch 140,    three parallel rails 142,     148  and
152 extend upwardly from the inner surface of the base of
shell  70.    The rails  142,  148 and 152  are located in the
portion of the shell     70 that form the barrel section of the
handpiece 64 Rail 142     is located towards the upper end of
shell  70.    Rail 152 is  located towards the lower end of the
shell.   Rail 148   is located between rails    142 and 152.       The
rails  142,   148 and 152  each have a proximal end that is
located on a common line that extends laterally across the
shell  70.    Webs 142 and 152   extend distally further than
rail  148.     Three webs 144 extend upwardly from the inner
surface of the base or shell 70.        Each web 144   also extends
outwardly from the top surface of rail 142.         A  rim 146
protrudes outwardly from the outer faces of web 142.           More
specifically, the rim 146 protrudes outwardly from the upper
portion of the rail     142.
[00063]     A  cylindrical boss 150    is formed integrally with
rail  148.    Boss 150 is  located at the proximal end of the
rails  148 so as to be located rearwardly of rails        142 and
152.   The boss   150 is  formed with a closed end bore,      (not
identified).     A rim 153 extends outwardly from the bottom of
                                   12

the exposed face of rail    152.   Rims 146 and 153    are both
formed with indentations 151 identified only on rim 146.
Indentations 151 extend inwardly from the opposed surfaces
of rims 146 and 153 that face each other.
[00064]    Three webs 154,   156 and 158    extend upwardly from
the shell base   69 and outwardly from the bottom face surface
of the rail 152.     Web 154  is located adjacent the proximal
end of the rail   152.   The shell 70 is    formed so that a
cylindrical boss 155 extends upwardly from the base of the
shell.   Boss 155  is integral with the end of web 154       spaced
from rail  152.   A closed end bore     (not identified) extends
from the exposed face of boss     155.    Web 156 is  located
forward web 154 and is    longer in length     (distance projecting
from rail  152)  than web 154.    Web 158   is the distal most
located web and is shorter in length than web 154.         A
step  160 projects outwardly from the bottom of rail 152.
Step  160 is  similar in shape to step 146 of rail 142.
[00065]    Two additional cylindrical bosses, bosses       162 and
164,  extend upwardly from inner surface of shell 70.         The
boss  162 is  located immediately above the distal end of
rail  142.   Boss 164 is  located immediately below the distal
end of rail 152.    Not identified are the closed end bores
formed in bosses   162 and 164.
[00066]    Right shell 70 is   further formed to define a
notch 168 in the top located rim 167.        The notch 168   extends
from the proximal end of the shell 70       along the whole of the
grip-forming portion 67 of the shell.        Notch 168 also
extends a short distance along the barrel-forming portion 65
of the shell 70.    The shell 70    is further formed to define a
ledge  170 that projects outwardly from the shell base        69 a
short distance below notch 168.       The ledge 170   occupies the
space below the notch 168 and extends a short distance,
approximately 1 cm forward of the distal end of the notch.
Webs  172 extend to the ledge 170.       Plural webs 172,  five
                                 13

shown, extend upwardly from the shell base so as to extend
between the upper rim and ledge 170.       Webs 172 have concave
faces.    More particularly ledge 170 and webs 172 are
dimensioned to compression hold the suction tube         66 in the
space above the ledge.
[00067]     In the depicted version of the invention, bracket
76 extends downwardly from the undersurface of ledge 170.
Webs  88,  92, 96, 102 and 144 also each extend downwardly
from the undersurface   of the ledge    170.
[00068]     Three parallel yokes   176,  178,  and 180 extend
upwardly from the inner surface of shell       70.   Yokes 176,   178
and 180   are located forward of rails    142 and 152 and have
co-linear lateral   axes that are along a line located between
rails  142 and 152.   The yokes  176,   178 and 180   are generally
in the form of planar structures.       Each yoke   176,  178 and
180 is  shaped to define a notch that has an arcuate base,
 (notches not identified).   Two additional     yokes 182   also
extend upwardly from the inner surface of shell 70.          Yokes
182 are parallel with each other.       Each yoke   182 extends
downwardly from the inner surface of the upper rim of the
shell.    The most proximal of the yokes 182     is approximately
longitudinally aligned with yoke 178.        The distal of the two
yokes  182 is  located forward of yoke 180.      Each yoke 182    is
formed to define a notch with a curved base        (notches not
identified).
[00069]     The base of the right shell 70     is formed to have a
through opening 186.    Through opening 186 is located between
yokes  178 and 180.   The through opening 186 is generally
rectangularly shaped.    In the depicted version of the
invention the proximal most corners of through opening 186
are rounded.    The major axis of the through opening 186 is
parallel to the longitudinal axes of yokes 178        and 180.
Spaced forward of the through opening 186,       the right shell
is  formed to have a recessed panel     188,  the distal end of
                                14

which is only partially seen in Figure 5.       The shell 70   is
shaped so that panel  188 extends proximally rearward from
the distal end of the shell.     Panel 188 thus defined a
recess in the outer surface of shell base 69.       This recess
leads  into the inside of the shell 70.
[00070]    The distally directed rim of shell 70     is  formed
with two semi-circular notches, notches     194 and 196.
[00071]    From Figures 7 and 8 it can be seen that      left
shell 210 has a shape that is a mirror image of right
shell  70.  The left shell 210 has a base 272 and a set of
rims that extend inwardly from the base.       When shells 70   and
210 are placed together, the right shell rims      71,  139,  167
and 193  abut left shell rims 274,   312,  318  and 346,
respectively.
[00072]    The left shell 210 is   formed so as to have a
distal end rim, rim 274 that is    formed with a notch 276.
The left shell notch 276 is   symmetric to the right shell
notch 72.   Here, the "symmetry" between shells     70 and 210
components  is around a plane that extends top-to-bottom
between the shells.   The left shell   is formed with two
brackets, brackets 278 and 280 that are located proximally
forward of and extend over notch 276.      Bracket 278 is
symmetric in location and shape to right shell bracket 74.
Bracket 280 is symmetric in location and shape to right side
bracket 78.   Thus while not identified, bracket 278 can be
considered to be formed to have a step 75      and a rib 76.
Bracket 280 has a step 79 and a rib 80.
[00073]    Four posts, posts 284,   296, 308   and 326 extend
outwardly from the inner surface of shell base 272.        Each
post 284,  296, 308 and 320  is formed to have a pin 287      (only
one identified) that extends outwardly from the free end of
the post.   Pins 286 have a diameter that    is smaller than
that of posts 284,  296, 308  and 326.    Shells 70  and 210 are
constructed so that when the shells are pressed together to
                                15

assemble handpiece     64:   the pin 287 integral with post 284
seats  in the bore hole integral with right shell boss 86;
the pin 287 integral with post 296 seats        in the bore
integral with right side boss       106;  the pin 287 integral with
post 308  seats in the bore integral with boss 155;       and the
pin 287 integral with post 326 seats in the bore integral
with boss   162.   The shell components     are further dimensioned
seating of the pins 287 in the complementary bosses         serves
to snap or compression fit the two shells        70 and 210
together.
[00074]     Between posts 284 and 296, ribs 286, 288,       290 and
292 extend outwardly from the inner surface of shell
base 212.    Rib 284 is    symmetric in shape and location to
right side rib    88.   Rib 284 is thus    formed with tabs 90.
Rib 288 is   symmetric in shape and location to right side
rib  92.  Rib 290 is symmetric in shape and location to right
side rib  96.    Rib 292 is symmetric in shape and location to
right side rib    102.
[00075]     The left shell 210 is      further formed so that
forward of and below post 296 a bracket 298 extends
outwardly from the inner surface of the shell base 212.
Bracket 298 is symmetric with respect to right shell bracket
122.   Accordingly, while not identified, it is understood
that bracket 298 has the same surfaces 124,        126, 128,  130
132,  134 and 136 as bracket 122.
[00076]     Two bosses   304 and 308 project outwardly from left
side shell base 272.       Boss 304   is symmetric in position to
right shell boss 110.       Boss 308   is symmetric in position to
right side boss 150.       Each boss 304 and 308   is formed with a
closed end bore,     (bores not identified).     Reinforcing
webs 306 extend outwardly from the perimeter of each
boss 304  to the shell base 272.
[00077]     Left shell 210 has a lower rim 312.       The bottom
rim 312  is  formed with a notch 314 that is      symmetric in
                                   16

shape and location to notch 140       integral with right
shell  70.   Immediately forward of notch 314,     a boss 316
extends upwardly from left shell base 272.        Boss 316 is
symmetric with right shell boss 164.        The boss 316 is formed
with a closed end bore,     (not identified).
[00078]     Opposite lower rim 312,     the left shell 210 has    a
top rim 318.    The shell 210 is     shaped so that a notch 320
extends distally forward from the proximal end of rim 318.
Notch 320 is   symmetric with respect to right shell
notch 168.    A ledge 322 projects outwardly from shell
base 212 below notch 320.      The left shell ledge 322    is
symmetric with respect to the right shell ledge 170.          The
left shell 210 is   further formed to have webs 324.       Webs 324
are symmetric with respect to right shell webs 172.         When
handpiece 64 is assembled, irrigation tube 56 rests        on
ledge  322 and abuts webs 324.
[00079]     Forward of post 326, the left shell 210 is      formed
with three parallel yokes     330,   332 and 334.  Yoke 330   is
symmetric in shape and location with respect to right shell
yoke  176.   Yoke 332 is  symmetric in shape and location with
respect to right side yoke 178.        Yoke 334 is symmetric in
shape and location with respect to right side yoke        180.
[00080]     Located above yokes 332     and 334 are two additional
parallel yokes, yokes    336.   Each yoke 336 is symmetric in
shape and location to a separate one of the right shell
yokes  182.   Yokes 336 extend outwardly from the inner
surface of top rib 318.
[00081]     Left shell 210 is   formed with a through
opening 340   and a recessed panel 342.      Through opening 340
is symmetric and shape and location with respect to the
through opening 186 integral with the right shell 70.
Panel  342 is  symmetric with respect to the right shell
recessed panel   188.  The left shell 210 has a distal rim,
rim 346.    Rim 346 is formed to have semi-circular two
                                  17

notches 348  and 350.  Notch 348   is symmetric with respect to
right shell notch 194.   Notch 350   is symmetric with respect
to left shell notch 196.
[00082]    Returning to Figures 3 and 4, it is understood
that motor 360 is  sandwiched between shells 70    and 210.      The
motor has a main body 362 that has plural    cylindrical
sections of diameters  that are similar in length.      A
cylindrical head 364 extends forward from body 362.        A
rotating shaft 366 extends forward from the head 364.         Motor
head 364 has  a diameter less than that of the body 362.
Shaft  366 has a diameter less than that of the motor
head 364.   The motor body 362 is   seated against the notch
defining inwardly curved faces of right sleeve ribs 92 and
96 and the complementary faces of the left sleeve ribs 288
and 290.   The proximal end of the body 362   is disposed
against the distally directed face of shell ribs 88       and 286.
The distal end of the motor body is disposed against the
proximally directed faces of shell ribs    102 and 292.      The
motor head 364 extends through the notches defined by the
shell ribs  102 and 292.
[00083]    A gear 370 is fitted to the free end of the motor
shaft  366 to rotate with the shaft.    Gear 370 engages a face
gear 372  also internal to the handpiece 64.    The face
gear 372,  as seen in Figure 9,   includes a disc shaped
base 374.   Teeth 376 extend upwardly from the base 374 so as
to extend around the outer perimeter of the base.       A raised
circular pedestal 378 extends upwardly from the center of
base 374.   Inner and outer sleeves 380   and 384,
respectively, extend upwardly from the exposed surface of
pedestal 378.   Pedestal 378 and sleeves 380   and 384    are
coaxial with the center axis, the rotational axis of gear
base 372.   The inner surface of outer sleeve 384    is   spaced
radially outwardly away the inner sleeve 380.      Arcuately
spaced apart webs 382 extend between the outer surface of
                               18

the inner sleeve 380 to the adjacent inner surface of the
outer sleeve 384.   Not identified is    the coaxial through
bore that extends through the inner sleeve 380      and the
underlying pedestal 378.    The outer sleeve is    formed with
teeth 386.
[00084]    A pin 390, seen in Figure 4, rotatably holds the
face gear 370  in handpiece 64.    Pin 390 extends through the
axial bore through pedestal 378    and inner sleeve 380.    One
end of pin 390 is  seated in the bore integral with right
shell boss 110.   The opposed end of pin 390    is  seated in the
bore integral with left shell boss 304.      The face gear 370
is positioned so the gear base 372 is     adjacent right shell
boss  110.  When handpiece 64 is   assembled, shaft gear 370
engages face gear teeth 376.
[00085]    The face gear 370  drives an eccentric gear 396
also rotatably disposed in the handpiece 64.       The eccentric
gear 396,  seen best in Figure 10,   is  formed with a circular
base 398.   The base 398 is  formed with a number of arcuately
spaced apart through openings 402.      Base 398 is  also formed
to have a number of arcuately spaced apart recesses 404.
The recesses 404  are located inwardly of the outer perimeter
of the base.   In the depicted version of the invention, the
recesses subtend different arcs.     Further, the recess 404
that extends the large arc intersects plural openings 402.
Teeth 406 protrude outwardly from the outer perimeter of
base 398.   A cylindrical head 408 protrudes upwardly from
gear base 398.   The center longitudinal axis of the head 408
is laterally offset from the rotation axis of the base 398.
The eccentric gear is  further formed to have a through
bore 410.   Bore 410 extends through the rotational axis of
the base and an outer portion of head 408     that extends over
the rotational axis of the base 398.      Gear 396 is formed
with two voids 412.   Voids 412 extend through the head 408
                                19

and the portion of the base 398 below the head.       Voids 412
are symmetric around a plane that bisects bore 410.
[00086]     A pin 416,   seen in Figure 4, rotatably holds the
eccentric gear 396 in the handpiece 46.       One end of pin 416
is seated in the bore integral with right shell boss 150.
The opposed end of pin 416 seats in bore integral with left
shell boss 308.    When the handpiece 64 is    assembled,
eccentric gear teeth 406 engage teeth 386 of the face
gear 372.
[00087]     The pump 420   includes a pump housing 422 now
described by reference to Figures 11-14.       The pump
housing 422   is formed from a single piece of molded plastic
and includes a base 424.      The base 424  includes an outer
sleeve 426 that along the outer surface is      of generally of
constant diameter.     A  lip 428 protrudes radially outwardly
from the proximal end of sleeve 426.       A ring 430 extends
proximally rearward from lip 428.      Ring 430  is located
inwardly of the outer perimeter of lip 428.       In the depicted
version of the invention, ring 430 has an inner diameter
that is  greater than the outer diameter of outer sleeve 426.
Pump housing is   further formed so that along the outer
surface of the ring a step 432 extends circumferentially
around the ring.    The outer diameter of the proximal portion
of the ring 430   is thus less than the outer diameter to the
distal portion of the ring, the portion distal to step 432.
Two flexible legs 434 extend rearwardly from lip 428.
Legs 434  are diametrically opposed to each other.      Each
leg 434  is  formed with an inwardly directed foot 436.
[00088]     Pump housing 422   is formed with an inner
sleeve 438 that   is coaxial with and disposed in outer
sleeve 426.    Inner sleeve 438 extends distally from the
proximal end of the outer sleeve 426.       The inner sleeve 438
terminates at a location approximately at the mid plane
through the outer sleeve.      Not identified is the circular
                                  20

web internal to the outer sleeve that extends to the inner
sleeve.   Sleeves 426 and 438  are dimensioned that that there
is an annular gap between the sleeves      (gap not identified).
At the proximal end of the inner sleeve 438      a circular
lip 442 projects inwardly from the sleeve.
[00089]    The outer sleeve 426 is further formed so that
three bores collectively extend through the sleeve.        A first
bore, bore 446 is  defined by the inner wall of the inner
sleeve 438.   A second bore, bore 480    is located immediately
forward of bore 446.   The third bore, bore 482      forms the
distal end opening into the outer sleeve 426.        The
sleeve 426 is formed so that bore 482 has      a diameter greater
than that of bore 480.
[00090]    Pump housing 422  is further formed to have a
cylindrical neck 484.   Neck 484 extends perpendicularly
upwardly from outer sleeve 426.      The pump housing 484   is
formed so that the neck 484   extends upwardly along an axis
that,  in addition to being perpendicular to the longitudinal
axis through sleeve 426 is   laterally offset from the
longitudinal axis through sleeve 426.       Neck 484  is formed
with a channel 486.   As seen in Figures 12 and 13,
channel 486 opens into the annular gap between outer and
inner sleeves 426 and 438.
[00091]    Housing neck 484 extends to a head 490.       Pump
housing head 490 has a main section, not      identified, that is
formed from a number of subs-section that can generally be
considered polygonal in shape.      In the disclosed version of
the invention, the head 490   is   formed with a top located
opening 492.   The opening 492 is    coaxial with neck
channel 486.   Opening 492  is present as a result of the
injection molding process used to form pump housing 422.
More specifically, the opening 492 is present as a result of
the component of the mold that defines neck channel 486.
During the process of manufacturing handpiece 64 a cap 494
                                21

seen only in Figure 4,  is fitted on the top of housing
head 490  to close opening 492.
[00092]    The pump housing 422   is formed so that two
fittings, fittings 496 and 504, extend proximally from the
proximally directed face of the head 490.      Fitting 496 is
the fitting to which the distal end of irrigation tube 56 is
fitted.   The housing 422 is formed with a closed end
bore 498  that extends through fitting 496 partially through
the head 490  to the neck channel 486.    The bore 498  thus is
the conduit through which the irrigating fluid flows from
the irrigation tube into the pump housing base 424.
[00093]    A cylindrical nose 502   extends distally forward
from the housing head 490.   Nose 502   is formed with a
cylindrical bore 512 that extends proximally rearward from
the distal front end of the nose.     Nose 502  and bore 512
share a common longitudinal axis.     An extension of this axis
would extend through the housing head 490 between where the
fittings 496 and 504 extend from the head.      Two channels 506
and 508  function as the fluid communication path through the
head from fitting 502  to bore 512.    Channels 506 and 508   are
along axes that are planar.   A   first one of the channels,
channel 506,  extends distally forward through fitting 504
and the proximal portion of the head.     Channel 508 extends
proximally from the base of bore 508    into the distal portion
of head 490.   Both channels 506 and 508 have D-shaped cross
sectional profiles.   Channels 506 and 508   are not coaxial.
Instead, pump housing 422  is formed so that widest portion
of channel 506 is  in registration with the widest portion of
channel 508.   The housing head is further formed so that the
most distal portion of channel 506 tapers into channel 508.
Similarly, the most proximal portion of channel 508     tapers
into channel 506.   Thus, channels 506 and 508 collectively
form a non-linear path through pump housing 422.
                               22

 [00094]    Upon assembly of handpiece 64,       the pump housing
base 424   is  sandwiched between right shell yokes 176,       178
and 180   and complementary left shell yokes 330,       332  and 334.
The distally directed surface of housing lip 428         is disposed
against the proximally directed surfaces of yokes         178 and
320.    Pump housing head 490    is   seated in the notches
integral to right shell yokes       182 and the notches defined by
the complementary left shell yokes 336.
 [00095]    A bellows 514,    seen best in Figures 15 and 16,
also part of pump 420,     extends proximally from the housing
base 424.     Bellows 514  is  formed from a flexible
thermoplastic and has     a cylindrical main body 516 formed
with circumferentially extending pleats         (not identified).
Bellows body 516 has a proximal closed end.          A button 519
extends outwardly from the closed end of bellows body 516.
A neck 517,    that has a diameter less than that of
button 519,    connects the button to the closed end of the
body 516.     A lip 518 extends radially outwardly and
circumferentially around the open end of bellows body 516.
A  ring 520 extends from the outer perimeter of lip 518
towards housing ring 430.       More particularly, bellows
ring 520   extends snuggly around housing ring 430.         An 0
ring 524,   seen only in Figure 15,      is seated on the step 432
integral with ring 430.       The 0-ring 524 is pressed between
the housing ring 430 and bellows lip 518.          The 0-ring 524
contributes to the seal between the bellows 514         and pump
housing base 424.     The housing legs 434 extend over the
outer surfaces of bellows ring 520.         The housing feet 436
extend over the bellows lip 518        so as to hold the bellows to
the pump housing 424.
 [00096]    A duck billed valve 526,      also part of pump 420,   is
seated in the bore defined by housing bore 446.          Valve 526
is  arranged so that the open end of the valve is directed
towards the bellows 520.       The lips of the valve 526 are
                                   23

directed towards tube bore 480.     Valve 526 has  a base 528
that extends radially outwardly from the valve around the
open end of the valve.    Base 528  is curved in cross  section.
The outer perimeter of the valve base 528 extends over the
proximal end of the inner sleeve 438    and the adjacent
lip 442.
[00097]     When handpiece 64 is assembled, bellows lip 516 is
disposed against the distal facing surfaces of yokes 176
and 330.    This component contact prevents the proximal
movement of both the pump housing 420    and the bellows
lip 516.
[00098]     A yoke 534, also part of pump 420,  is moveably
disposed in handpiece 64.    As seen best in Figure 17,
yoke 534,   which is a single piece unit, includes a generally
rectangular frame 536.    The longitudinal axis of the
frame  536 is parallel with the longitudinal axis of the
handpiece barrel.    Frame 536 is  formed from a number of
longitudinally and lateral extending beams 538     and 540,
respectively.    The two most proximally located lateral beams
540 are curved so as to define an oval opening 542     in the
frame.   The major axis opening 542 is perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis major axis of the frame 536.      Open 542 has
a minor width that is dimensioned to receive eccentric gear
head 406.
[00099]     Yoke 538 further includes two parallel disks 544
and 546 that are located at the distal end of frame 536.
Disks  544 and 546, which are spaced apart from each other,
are located in planes perpendicular to the plane of yoke
frame  536.   The disks are centered on an extension of the
longitudinal axis through the frame.     The distalmost disk,
disk 546 is   formed with a U-shaped notch 550.    The center of
the base of notch 546 is located on the extension of the
longitudinal axis through the frame.     Disks 544  and 546 are
spaced apart distance that facilitates the snug fitting of
                                24

bellows button 519 between the disks.      Disk 546 is  shaped so
that notch 550 can receive bellows neck 517.
[000100]   Upon assembly of handpiece 64,     the yoke 534  is
positioned to seat on right shell rails     142,  148, and 152.
More particularly the yoke 534     is disposed between rim 144
of rail 142  and rim 153 of rail 152.     When the yoke 534    is
so positioned, head 408  of eccentric gear 396 seats in the
yoke frame opening 542.    The bellows button 519 s is     seated
between disks 544  and 546.   Owing to the construction of
both the bellows 514 and the yoke 534,     the bellows body 516
expands and contracts with the reciprocation of the yoke.
[000101]   A cable 551 seen in Figure 18 and in dashed lines
in Figure 18A, is  typically bundled with the assembly that
comprises the paired irrigation tube 56 and suction tube 66.
The proximal end of the cable is     connected to a power
supply 549 associated with the lavage unit 50.       This power
supply 549 may take the form of a battery pack.
Alternatively, the power supply may take the form of a
device that converts AC voltage into DC voltages that are
two different potentials.     The exact structure of the power
supply is not a part of the structure of the lavage unit 50
of this application.   In Figure 18A the power supply 549 is
depicted as four series connected cells      (individual cells
not identified).
[000102]   Internal to the cable 551 are plural     insulated
wires.   For ease of illustration, these wires are only shown
in Figure 18A.   One wire, wire 552,    is connected to a
contact 553 attached to motor 360.      The proximal end of wire
552 is  typically connected to the ground associated with the
power supply 549.   Cable 550  includes two additional wires,
wires 554 and 558.   Wires  554 and 558   are the wires over
which energization signals having different potentials are
sourced from the power supply 549 to the handpiece.        In
Figure 18A this  is depicted by wires 552 and 554 being
                                25

collectively connected to all four cells and wires 552 and
558 being collectively connected to only two cells.
Wire 554  is connected to a conductive post 556 that projects
from a first one of the right shell bosses 84.      Wire 558   is
connected to a conductive post 560 that projects from the
second right shell boss 84.
[000103]   The switch 562 is  slidably mounted to the proximal
end of handpiece 64.   Switch 562,   now described with respect
to Figures 19 and 20,  includes a plate 564   that is generally
rectangularly shaped.   A closed loop rib 566 protrudes
outwardly from the proximally directed surface of plate      564.
Rib 566 is generally in the form of a rectangle with rounded
corners.   The rib 566 is dimensioned to define a space,      (not
identified,)  for receiving the tip of thumb or finger.      An
elongated foot 568  extends perpendicularly forward from the
distally directed surface of plate 564.     Foot  568 is
generally triangularly shaped.     The switch 562  is formed so
to have a void space  570 that extends inwardly from the
distal end of foot 568.    Two parallel ribs 572   also project
outwardly from the distally directed face of plate      564.
Ribs 572,  in addition to being parallel to each other, are
parallel to the plane in which foot 568 is    disposed.    A
conductive contact 576 is   seated in and extends outwardly
from foot void space  570.
[000104]   Switch 562 is mounted to the handpiece so that the
proximally directed face of plate 564    is disposed against
the inner surfaces of shells 70    and 210.  The proximally
directed face of switch plate 564    is accessible through the
opening in the handpiece formed by the contiguous notches 72
and 276. The distally directed face of plate 564     is  located
immediately rearward of right side shell brackets 74      and 78
and the complementary left shell brackets 278 and 280.
[000105]   Switch 562 slidably moves within the space in
which the switch is mounted.     Switch 562 is held in one
                                26

position by the abutment of the lower located rib 572
against the lower surface of complementary handpiece ribs
76.    The switch is held in the second position by the
abutment of the upper located rib 572      against the top
surface of rib    80.  Owing to the flexible nature of brackets
74   and 278 and brackets 78   and 280,  manual force can flex
the brackets and associated ribs so as to allow the sliding
movement of switch 562.     Contact 576 is disposed between
conductive posts 556 and 560.       Depending on the position of
switch 562,   the contact 576 abuts either post 556 or post
560.
[000106]    An insulated wire 578 extends from contact 576.
The terminal 577    that connects wire 578 to connector 576 is
seen in Figure 4.     This terminal 577   is connected to a tab
 (not identified) that is part of contact 576.      The opposed
end of wire 578    is connected to a contact 582 moveably
mounted to right shell 70.      Contact 582, best seen in
Figure 18B,   is the form of an arcuately shaped flexible
piece of metal.     At one end contact 582 has a curved
head 584   the head of the contact seats in the void space
between tab 143 and the shell lower rim 139.       In Figure 18,
trigger 561   is not seen so the position of the contact
relative to right side shell 70      can be better seen.
Adjacent head 584,    the contact has a tab 585.    Tab 585 is
the structural component of the contact to which a
connector 587    (Figure 4) is  attached.   The connector 587  is
the component that holds the end of wire 578 to contact 582.
[000107]    The body of contact 582    curves first distally away
from the head.     The free end of the contact 582   curves
upwardly and proximally towards the distally directed face
of the motor 360.     The free end of the contact 582    is
positioned to abut a conductive post 586 that projects
upwardly from boss 108.     Owing to the shape of the contact
and the restraining force of tab 143,      contact 582 is
                                  27

normally spaced from post 586.       An insulated wire 588
extends from post 586 to the second connector 589 attached
to motor 360.
[000108]     When handpiece 64 is assembled, contact 582     is
positioned so that the contact head 584 seats around shell
pin 135.     The body of the contact 582   extends distally away
from the pin in the space adjacent the distal end of shell
bracket 137.
[000109]     The trigger 561,  as seen best in Figures 21    and
22,  is  formed from a single piece of plastic.     The
trigger 561     is shaped to have a front panel  602 that is
generally rectangular in shape.       Two parallel side
panels   604 extend proximally rearward from the oppose side
edges of the front panel     602.  The side panels 604,  in
addition to extending proximally curve downwardly below the
front panel 602.      A finger 605 protrudes forward from the
proximal end of each side panel 604.       Each finger 605 has   a
main body that is     spaced above the side panel  604 with which
the finger is integral.      Each finger 605  is able to flex and
return to its initial position relative to the associated
side panel     604.  A bottom panel 606,  only the edges of which
are seen in the Figures, extends rearwardly from the front
panel   602 and between the side panels 604.     A tab  610
extends distally and perpendicularly from the front
panel   602.    Tab 610 is located in a plane that intersects
the top to bottom longitudinal axis through the front
panel   602.    A cylindrical beam 612 extends through tab    610.
The longitudinal axis of beam 612 is      thus parallel to the
lateral   axis that extends side to side through the front
panel   602.
[000110]     A  rectangularly shaped tab 616 extends upwardly
from the proximal end edge of the bottom panel 606.         Tab 616
is  located between and spaced apart from the surrounding
side panels     604.  The tab 616 is  able to flex relative to
                                  28

the rest of the trigger 561.     A bar 618 extends laterally
across the top of the tab 616.     The bar 618 projects
outwardly from the proximally directed face of the tab     616.
In the depicted version of the trigger a small tab 620 is
shown adjacent the bar protruding outwardly from one of the
side panels  604.   The trigger 561  is shaped so that tab 616
extends a short distance above the adjacent side panels.      A
cylindrical beam 622 extends across the top of tab 616.
Beam 622 has  a radius that facilitates the seating of the
tab in the notch defined side surfaces 128    and step surfaces
130 of shell brackets 122 and 296.
[000111]   Upon assembly of handpiece 64,   the opposed ends of
trigger beam 612   seat in the opposed bores formed in right
shell boss 164 and left shell boss 316.     The trigger 561
extends through the opening formed by contiguous notches 140
and 314.   The trigger 561  is able to pivot around the
longitudinal axis through beam 612.     Downward movement of
the trigger 561   is limited by the abutment of bar 616
against the inner surfaces of shell bottom rims 139 and 312
that define the proximal ends of notches 140 and 314.
Upward movement of the trigger 461 is    limited by the
abutment of fingers   605 against the interlocked boss 155   and
post 308.
III.       TIP ASSEMBLY
[000112]   The tip assembly 650 as seen in Figure 23,
includes a connector 652,   a body 720  and the spray shield
770.  Connector 652 is   the component of the tip assembly
that is  removably attached to the handpiece   64.  The
body 720  includes the irrigation tube 730   through which the
fluid discharged by the pump is discharged and the
surrounding suction tube 750.     The spray shield 770  is
removably attached over the distal end of the body 720.
                                29

[000113]   From Figures 24-26 it can be seen that
connector 652 is   formed from a single piece of plastic and
is  shaped to have a plate  670 that is   approximately oval is
shape.   A leg  654 extends reward from each opposed sides,
the opposed major side edges of the plate.       Each leg 654    is
generally in the form of a rectangular panel.       The legs 654
are flexible relative to plate     670.  Each leg 654 is    formed
to have a raised a recess 656 that extends inwardly from the
outer exposed face of the leg.      The recesses  656 are
dimensioned to receive the tip of the finger.       A foot   660
extends outwardly from the exposed face each leg.       Each
foot  660 is spaced from the recess 656 forming portion of
the leg by a gap 658.    Gaps 658 have a proximal-to-distal
width that accommodate the seating of the portions of the
shell bases 69 and 272 that extend between openings 186 and
338  and the complementary recessed panels    188 and 342.     The
feet  660 extend laterally, top to bottom, along legs 654.
Each foot  660 has  at the proximal end of the foot, a
surface 662  that tapers outwardly and distally forward away
from the leg 654 with which the foot is formed.
[000114]   A rim 672 extends distally forward around the
outer perimeter of the connector plate     670.   The
connector 652 is   further formed so that rim 672 has     a
recessed surface 675 that at the distal front end of rim is
located inwardly from the rest of the rim       The rim 672 is
formed so that recessed surface 675 extends
circumferentially around the rim.
[000115]   The connector 652 is    further formed so that a tube
like irrigation fitting 676 extends through the plate        670.
Irrigation fitting has   three sections each with a constant
outer diameter that are located proximal to the plate.         A
first  section, section 678,  is   located immediately adjacent
the plate  670.   A second section, section, 680 extends
proximally from section 680.     A  third section, section 682
                                30

extends proximally from section 680 and is     the most proximal
portion of irrigation fitting 676.      Section 680 has   an outer
diameter less than the outer diameter of section 678.
Section 682 has an outer diameter less than the outer
diameter of section 680.    section
[000116]   Irrigation fitting has   an elongate section,
section 673  that extends forward of the plate    670 and is
coaxial with sections 676,   678 and 680.    Section 673 has    an
outer diameter that extending distally from the plate       670,
decreases.   A nose 684 forms the most distal portion of the
irrigation fitting 676.    Nose  684 has  an outer diameter less
that of the adjacent section 682.     The most distal end of
the nose is  tapered such that extending proximally from the
distal end of the nose the outer diameter of the distal end
portion increases.   The connector 652 is    further formed so
that three concentric bores 690,    692  and 694 extend through
the irrigation fitting.    Bore 690 extends distally from the
proximal end of fitting section 680 to approximately where
fitting sections 676 and 678 meet.      Bore 690 is  of constant
diameter.   Bore 692 extends from the distal end of bore 690
through fitting sections 678 and 673.      The diameter of
bore 692 decreases with distance from bore 690.       Bore  694
begins  at approximately the location where nose 682 emerges
from fitting section 682.    Bore 694   is of constant diameter
and extends to the distal end of the irrigation fitting 676.
[000117]   Connector plate  670 is  also formed to have a
generally tubular suction fitting 702     that extends
proximally rearward from the plate so as to rearward of
rim 672.   Suction fitting 702 has a proximal most head
section 704.   The head section 704 has an outer diameter
less than that of the main body of the fitting 702       (main
body not identified).   A bore 706 extends axially through
the suction fitting 602.    The connector 652 is    formed so
                                31

that as the bore extends proximally from the opening in
plate   670 there is a decrease in the diameter of the bore.
[000118]    The connector 652 is     further formed so that four
parallel spaced apart ribs 708,       710, 712 and 714   extend
upwardly from the elongate section 682 of the irrigation
fitting 676.    Ribs 708  and 714 extend outwardly from the
opposed outer sides of section 682.        Ribs 710 and 712   are
located between ribs   708 and 714      Ribs 710  and 712 extend
upwardly from the top surface of fitting section 682.           Each
708,  710,  1712 and 714  terminates at a location adjacent
where bore 706 starts    to taper inwardly from distally
directed face of plate 706.      The ribs 708,    710,  712 and 714
each have a top surface     (surfaces not identified) that from
the distal end of the irrigation fitting elongate
section 682   curves in a concave shape upwardly and
proximally, then tapers linearly upwardly and the curves in
a convex shape to the plate 670.        The ribs are formed so
that the top surfaces of ribs 708       and 714  are located above
the top surfaces of ribs 710     and 712.
[000119]    The tip assembly body 720, now described by
reference to Figures 27-29, is       formed as a single-piece
unit.    The body is shaped to have head 722.       The head 722
has an oval shaped lip 724.      Lip 724   is dimensioned to fit
snuggly over the rim 672 integral with connector 652.           Not
identified are the outwardly stepped surfaces formed in the
inner wall of lip against which rim 672 and the distally
located recessed surface 675 of the rim seat.          The head 722
defines a void space   725 located forward of lip.        The head
722  is  asymmetrically shaped in that the outer surface of
the head, adjacent the top of lip 724       tapers to a location
offset from the minor axis running through center of the
opening defined by the lip.      More particularly the head
defines a void space   725 dimensioned to extend a short
distance distally relative to where bore 706 extends from
                                  32

plate  652 and a longer distance distally so as to
accommodate the elongate section 582     of the irrigation
fitting 676.   Thus, the head 720   is  shaped so that the cross
sectional area of the head, in planes perpendicular to the
longitudinal proximal-to-distal axis along tip assembly
body 720,  decreases as the head extends distally forward.
[000120]   Suction tube 730 has constant inner and outer
diameters and extends distally forward from the distal end
of head 722.   Approximately 2 cm from the distal end of the
tube,  suction tube 730 is  formed to have four tabs   732,
 (only three seen in Figure 27,)   that project outwardly from
the outer surface of the tube.     Two tabs  732 are parallel
with each other and extend outwardly from the tube adjacent
the top of the tube 730.    The remaining two tabs 732   are
symmetrically located with respect to the first two tabs
relative to a plane that extends through the longitudinal
axis that extends between the proximal and distal ends of
the tube 730.
[000121]   The suction tube 730   is further formed to have two
notches 734  that extend inwardly from distal end of the
tube.   Notches 734 are U-shaped.    The notches 734 are
symmetrically located and around a longitudinal axis that
extends between the proximal and distal ends of the tube.
If tabs 732  are considered extending from the top and bottom
portions of the suction tube 730,    notches 734 extend
inwardly from the opposed sides of the tube.
[000122]   Irrigation tube  750 is  disposed inside suction
tube 730.   The irrigation tube   750 is  not coaxial with the
suction tube 730.   Instead, the irrigation tube 750, which
has an outer diameter less than that of the inner diameter
of the suction tube 730,   extends outwardly from the inner
wall of the suction tube 730.     Thus,  owing to the position
of the irrigation tube in the suction tube, the suction tube
can be considered to have a through lumen 736 that,     as seen
                                33

in Figure 29,  is  crescent shaped.       Tip assembly body 720    is
further formed so that the irrigation tube 750        terminates at
a location proximal to the distal end of the suction
tube 750.
[000123]   The irrigation tube 750      is  formed to have a number
of contiguous coaxial bores.       A  first bore, bore 752     extends
forward from the proximal end of the tube 750.          Bore 752   is
of constant diameter.     A bore 754    is  located immediately in
front of bore 752.    Bore 754   tapers inwardly as it extends
distally.   Bores 752 and 754    are collectively designed to
receive and compression hold in place the nose 684          integral
with the connector irrigation fitting 676.         Forward of
bore 754  tube 750 has   a bore 756 of constant diameter.         In
terms of length, bore 756 is the shortest in length of the
bores that extend through the irrigation tube        750.    A
bore 758  extends from the distal end of bore 756 to the
distal end of the irrigation tube 750.         Bore 758  is  the
longest in length and smallest in diameter of the bores
forming the flow through path through the irrigation
tube 750.
[000124]   In the depicted version of the invention, a
rim 760  extends inwardly and circumferentially around the
distal end of the discharge tube.         The rim defines an
orifice 762  that extends forward from the distal end of
bore 758.   Rim 760  is dimensioned so that the diameter of
the orifice increases distally from the distal end of
bore 758.
[000125]   The spray shield 770, now described with reference
to Figures 30,  31  and 32,   is formed from a single piece of
flexible plastic such as PVC.        The spray shield 770    is
shaped to have a stem 772.      Stem 772    is formed from four
arcuate sections 774,    776,  778 and 780    that collectively
defining an opening    (not indentified) into which the distal
end of the tip assembly body 720       is  inserted.  In Figure 30,
                                  34

sections 774   and 778 are shown as forming the opposed top
and bottom sections of the stem 772.      The inner surfaces of
sections 774   and 778 extend around portions of a circle that
is  approximately 1 mm smaller in diameter than the diameter
of the distal end of irrigation tube 730.      Sections 774 and
778  are shown as being each formed with a rectangularly
shaped through opening 780.     Through openings 780 are
positioned and shaped to receive tip assembly body tabs     732.
Stem sections 776 and 780 are located between stem sections
774  and 778.   The stem section project outwardly beyond the
circle defined by the outer surfaces of stem sections 774
and 778.
 [000126]   Spray shield 770  is further formed to have a
head 786 that extends forward from the distal end of the
stem 772.    Head 784 has a conic shape such that the outer
diameter of the head increases distally from stem 772.
 [000127]   Both the stem 772  and head 786 have internal void
spaces.    Void space 782 is  the void space that extends
axially from the proximal end of the stem 772     into the head.
The spray shield 770   is further formed so that a rib 784
protrudes inwardly from the inner wall of the shield that
defines void space 782.    Head 786 has void space 788   that is
generally conical in shape.     The distal end of void
space   788 defines the distal end opening into the spray
shield 770.    The spray shield 770   is further formed so that
the head 786 has   two bleed ports 790   that extend from the
outer surface of the head into void space 788.
 [000128]   When tip assembly 650   of this invention is
assembled, connector 652 is press fit in tube body head 722.
A gasket 791,   seen in Figure 23,   is disposed around the step
between sections 680 and 682 of the assembly irrigation
fitting 676.    A gasket 792  is disposed around the step
between the head 702 and main body of the suction
fitting 702.
                                 35

IV.  Operation
[000129]  Lavage unit 30 of this invention is prepared for
use by first fitting the tip assembly 650 to the
handpiece 64.   This connection is performed by sliding the
connector legs 654 over the outer surfaces of the recessed
panels 188 and 342 integral with the handpiece 64.     Each
connector foot 660 seats in a separate one of the handpiece
openings 188 and 338.   The seating of feet 660 in the
handpiece openings 188 and 338 releasably holds the tip
assembly 650 to the handpiece.    There is a small gap between
the handpiece panels 188 and 342 and the connector legs 654.
This gap allows the legs 654 to be flexed inwardly.     The
flexing of the legs inwardly retracts the connector feet 660
out of the handpiece openings 188 and 338.    Once the
connector feet 660 are so retracted, the tip assembly 650
can be removed from the handpiece 64.
[000130]  As a consequence of the fitting of the tip
assembly 650 to the handpiece, the connector irrigation
fitting section 680 seats in bore 482 internal to the pump
housing 420.   Connector irrigation fitting 702 seats in pump
housing bore 512.
[000131]  The irrigation tube 56 is connected to the source
of irrigating fluid 54.   Suction tube 66 is connected to
waste collection container 68 and suction source 61.     The
cable 550 is connected to the power supply.    With these
connections made, the lavage unit is ready for use.
[000132]  When trigger 561 is not being depressed, owing to
its shape, contact 582 is normally spaced from post 586.
Consequently there is no current flow to motor 360.
Pump 420 is therefore in the off state.    The practitioner
actuates the pump 420 by depressing trigger 561.    This
causes bar 618 to pivot upwardly so as to abut contact 582.
The abutment of the bar 618 against the contact 582 results
                               36

in the contact being pivoted against post 586.      The abutment
of contact 582 against post 586 closes the power circuit to
the motor 360.   The actuation of the motor 360    results in
gears 370 and 396 and yoke 534 cooperating to reciprocate
bellows 514.   The expansion of the bellow 514 draws
irrigating fluid from tube 56 through pump housing
fitting 498  and channel 486 into the bellows.     The
retraction of the bellows forces the fluid out through
valve 526 into the tip assembly irrigation tube 750.      The
fluid is discharged to the site at which the open end of the
spray shield 720  is applied.
[000133]   When contact 582  is pivoted into the above state,
the body of the contact adjacent the contact head 484
presses against the adjacent end surface of beam 137.      As a
consequence of the continued pivoting of the contact, the
material forming the beam stores potential energy that, when
released, would cause the beam 582 to flex back into the off
position wherein the beam is spaced from post 586.
[000134]   When trigger 561  is initially displaced to actuate
the pump 420,  the trigger beam 622 travels over the
proximally directed surfaces of handpiece brackets 122 and
298.   This results in the trigger tab 616    flexing rearwardly
from the side panels  604.   Simultaneously the trigger
fingers  605 press against boss 155 and complementary
post 308  internal to the handpiece.     Thus results in current
flow to the 360 and the actuation of 424.      As the trigger
bar  618 moves contact 582 against post 586,    the opposed end
of the trigger beam seat in the notch defining side
surfaces 128  of the brackets 122    and 298.  When the
trigger 561  is in this position, the resilient force of the
fingers  605 abutment against boss 155    and post 308 can urge
the trigger downwardly.    Thus,   if the practitioner wants to
deactivate the pump 420  it is only necessary to release the
force on the trigger 561.    The restoring force imposed by
                                37

the trigger fingers  605 on the rest of the trigger move the
trigger downwardly.   The bar  618 moves away from the
contact 582.   Owing to the resilient nature of the material
forming the contact 582,  the potential energy stored in the
contact as a consequence of the flexing of the contact is
released.   This results in the contact 582  flexing away from
post 586.   This breaks the connection to the motor 360 so as
to deactivate the pump 420.    Thus the practitioner is able
to, by the selective pivoting of the trigger 561,   operate
the lavage unit 30 in a momentary on/momentary off mode.
[000135]   There may be a point  in the procedure in which the
practitioner wants the lavage unit 30   to continually
discharge irrigating fluid.    If the practitioner wants to
operate the unit 30 in a constant on state, the practitioner
pivots  the trigger upwardly from the position of the
momentary on state.   This results in the trigger beam 622
seating against the step surfaces 130   of the brackets 122
and 298.   Once the beam 622 is  so positioned, the downward
movement the fingers  605 impose on the trigger is blocked by
the abutment of the beam against the bracket step
surfaces 130.   The practitioner can release the pivot force
on the trigger and the trigger will stay in this position.
Again when in this position, the trigger holds the
contact 582  against the conductive post 586.   Thus, when the
trigger 561  is in this position the lavage unit is  in a
constant on state.   The practitioner applies irrigating
fluid without having to be take the mental and physical
steps to ensure that the trigger is depressed.
[000136]   Lavage unit 30 is  transitioned from the constant
on state to the off state by the continued depression of the
trigger 561.   This displacement of the trigger causes the
opposed ends of the beam 622 to first travel over bracket
side surfaces 132.   Once the beam 622 reaches the top of
side surfaces 132,  the trigger tab  616 is free to flex
                               38

distally to the static position of the tab.      Beam 622
travels over bracket top surfaces 134.      The biasing force
imposed by fingers   606 is not opposed.    The force imposed by
fingers  606 move the trigger downwardly.     During the initial
part of this downward movement of the trigger 561, beam 622
travel over the distally directed side surfaces 136 of the
brackets 122   and 298.  As a consequence of the forward and
downward movement of the trigger beam 622,     the beam moves
away from contact 582.    Owing to the resilient properties of
the material from which the contact 582 is     formed, the
contact returns to its initial     static state in which the
contact is   spaced from the post 586.    Again, the movement of
the contact 582 away from the post 586 deactivates the
motor 360 and, by extension, pump 420.      The force imposed by
fingers  606  thus returns the trigger 561 to the at rest,
off, position.
[000137]   The speed of the pump is set by the setting of
switch 562.    The switch 562  can be set to place contact 576
in physical contact with either post 556 or 560.      The
potential applied to the motor 360, the speed of the
pump 420,  is  a function of which post 556 or 560   is in
contact with contact 460
[000138]   The on/off state and draw rate of through the
suction drawing components    of the lavage unit is controlled
by the suction source 61.     Thus the on/off state and draw
rate through suction tube   730 is   independent of the extent
to which irrigating fluid is discharged from the lavage
unit 50.   As previously mentioned the lumen 736 through the
suction tube 730   is crescent shape.    The cross width of the
lumen of a suction tube in which there is     a coaxially
extending irrigation tube   is equal to one half the inner
diameter of the suction tube minus the outer diameter of the
irrigation tube.    Tip assembly 650 of this invention is
constructed so suction tube 750 extends along an axis that
                                 39

is laterally offset from the axis through the center of the
suction tube 730.     Consequently, the cross width of the
lumen in the areas of its maximum width is      greater than that
of the cross width through the suction lumen above-described
conventional tip assembly.     This increase in cross width
through the suction lumen reduces the likelihood that solid
and semi-solid wastes drawn through the suction tube 730
will clog the tube.
[000139]   The waste stream flows out the suction tube 730
into the void space 725 internal to tip assembly head 722.
Ribs 708,  710,  712,  714 direct the waste stream towards the
inlet opening into suction fitting 702.       This reduces the
incidence of turbulence within the head void space      725.
[000140]   Further, once the waste is drawn into the
handpiece 64,   the waste flows through first through
channel 508  and then through channel 506 in the pump
housing 422.    Channels 506 and 508 are both D-shaped in
cross  section.   Pump housing 422    is further formed so that
the widest  sections of the channels 506 and 508     are the
portions of the channels that are contiguous with and
partially overlap each other.      This  feature of the invention
reduces the likelihood that the waste can clog within the
pump housing 422   as the flow path laterally shifts through
the housing.    This shift,  it is understood is   from an axis
that is  located along the midplane of vertical plane through
the housing to an axis that is      laterally to one side of this
midplane.
[000141]   When suction is applied and spray shield 770
fitted to the tip body, spray shield ports 790      function as
bleed ports.    Spray shield stem 772 covers the suction tube
notches 734  so there is essentially minimal loss of suction
through these notches.     When the tip body, without the spray
shield is applied to the patient, tip body notches 734
function as bleed ports.     The flow of air through the bleed
                                 40

ports prevents the drawing in of the exposed unsevered
tissue into the handpiece 64.
V.    FIRST ALTERNATIVE CONSTRUCTION
 [000142]    An alternative right side shell 810 of this
invention is    seen in Figure 33.   Right side shell   810 has
many of the features of the above described right side
shell   70.   Accordingly, these features are not redescribed.
The right side shell    810 is  further formed to have a
beam 812 that projects inwardly from the shell base 69.
Beam 812 is    located forward of bracket 122.   Shell   810 is
shaped so that beam 812 is     a three sided structure that   is
arranged so that what appear as the base of the beam is
directed towards notch 140.
 [000143]    Figure 34 depicts an alternative trigger 820.      The
trigger 820 has many of the same structural components as
previously described trigger 561.      Trigger 820  is not formed
with fingers    that extend over the side panels   604.   Instead,
the trigger 820    is formed with a single flexible beam 822
that is   generally planar in shape.    Beam 822 extends forward
from tab    610 and lies in a plane perpendicular to the plane
of tab 610.     The opposed side edges of finger 882 are
inwardly tapered.     Thus the width across the finger 822
decreases along forward of tab 610.
 [000144]    Returning to Figures 33,  it can be seen that the
trigger 820    is mounted to the shells  forming the handpiece
the same way trigger 561 is mounted to the shells.        The
opposed ends of beam 612 are seated in the bores internal to
shell bosses 164    and 316.   In this version of the invention
a spring 826,    seen only Figure 33,  extends from the base of
beam 812 into the trigger 820 so as to be located between
the trigger sidewalls 604.      The base of the spring 826 seats
against the inner surface of trigger bottom panel       606.
Spring 826 holds the trigger 820     in the off position.
                                  41

[000145]   The force spring 826 imposes on the trigger 820
can be overcome by the manual depression of the trigger.
When the trigger is moved upwardly, trigger beam 822     is
pressed against rims   139 and 312  integral with,
respectively, shells   810 and 210.   The abutment of
finger 822 against the shells 210 and 810 places a force on
the trigger 820  in opposition to the manually applied force.
The damping of the manual   force reduces the likelihood that
the practitioner through the inadvertent application of a
large  force, immediately set the trigger in the constant on
state.   In some versions of the invention, the resistance of
the beam 822  to return to the unflexed state provides the
force that returns the trigger to the off state.
VI.   FURTHER ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENTS
[000146]   Alternative versions of the invention are
possible.   For example, there is   no requirement that all
versions of the invention include each of the above
described features.    Thus the tip assembly with
asymmetrically positioned suction and irrigation tubes may
be practiced with handpieces other than the described
handpiece.   Likewise,  the described handpiece need not
always be used with the described tip assembly.
[000147]   In alternative versions of the invention pump
housing 422 may not be provided with cap 492.      In these
versions of the invention the opening into neck is closed by
first molding an extension over the neck when the pump
housing is  formed.  A heat stake process is then used to
shape the extension to form a cap.
[000148]   It should further be understood that while the
lavage unit of this unit may be include pumps different than
the described pump that discharges pulses    of irrigating
fluid.   For example, the handpiece may be provided with a
pump that delivers a continuous    stream of irrigating fluid.
                                42

Likewise, in some versions   of the invention, the pump may be
in a console that is   spaced from the handpiece.    In these
versions of the invention, the trigger and speed control
assemblies are still present.     The signals  generated be
these assemblies  are applied over a cable to a control
module internal to the console.     Based on these signals the
control module regulates both the on/off state of the pump
and the pump operating rate.
[000149]   In versions  of the invention wherein a spring
holds and returns the trigger to the off position,
components  like fingers  605 and beam 822 may be omitted.
Similarly, in versions   of the invention where fingers    605
and/or beam 822 are present the need to provide metal spring
may be omitted.   Further in some versions    of the invention
the handpiece and trigger may be designed so that gravity
provides some or all of the biasing force that, when the
trigger is the pump momentary on position, in the absence of
a manually applied force, returns the trigger to the pump
off position.   In these and other versions    of the invention
the handpiece itself would not have an actually biasing
member that performs this   function.   In some versions of the
invention, the biasing member may be a component separate
from the trigger.   This biasing member may be a section of
elastomeric material or a spring.
[000150]   Also, there may be versions   of the invention that
do not include conduits through which suction is drawn away
from the site to which the lavage unit is     applied.
[000151]   Likewise the trigger and handpiece may have
different components that are shaped so that:      when the
trigger engages a first feature of the handpiece, the
trigger causes the pump to be actuated and wherein the
biasing force applied to the trigger is able to move the
trigger to the off position;   and when the trigger engages a
second feature of the handpiece, the trigger causes the pump
                                43

to be actuated and the biasing force applied to the trigger
is not able to move the trigger from that position.    In some
versions of the invention it may be desirable to design the
handpiece and trigger so that, when the trigger is moved
from the off position to a first pump on position the
trigger engages a feature of the handpiece that holds the
trigger in the on position and that the biasing force
applied to the trigger does not dislodge the trigger from
that position.   Thus, the trigger is  in the toggled,
constant on position.   Then, when the trigger is moved from
the first pump on position to a second pump on position, the
trigger continues to hold the pump in the state yet the
biasing force applied to the trigger is able to move the
trigger to the pump off position.    In these versions of the
invention the trigger may not when in both positions engage
static components of the handpiece.
[000152]  Further in some versions of the invention, the
flexible components that hold the trigger in one or both of
the momentary on or toggled   (constant) on positions may be
mounted to the handpiece. These features, for example, may
be spring like members mounted to the handpiece.    In these
versions of the invention, the trigger may not have any
flexible components.
[000153]  Alternative methods of attaching the spray shield
to the tip assembly are also possible.    For example, in some
versions of the invention the distal end of the tip is
provided with an outwardly extending rib that extends at
least partially if not completely circumferentially around
the tip.  The spray shield is formed so that internal to the
stem there is a groove that projects outwardly from the
inner surface of the stem that defines the void space in
which the tip is  inserted.  When the spray shield is  fitted
to the tip assembly, the stem is positioned so that the tip
assembly rib seats in this groove.
                               44

[000154]   In some versions of the invention the fitting
through which irrigating fluid is discharged into the tip
assembly irrigation tube 750   and/or the fitting through
which the suction is drawn from the tip assembly suction
tube 730 may be part of the handpiece.     A single surface may
replace the ribs integral with the irrigation fitting 750
that direct the surrounding waste stream towards the suction
fitting 702.
[000155]   Likewise the means by which the tip assembly 650
is removably attached to the handpiece may vary from has
been described.   Thus the components   that perform the
locking function of legs  654 and feet 660 may be part of the
handpiece.   In these versions of the invention, the tip
assembly is  formed with components against which the
handpiece locking components seat.
[000156]   Other tip assemblies of this invention may be
arranged so that while the irrigation tube is disposed in
the suction tube, the arrangement of the tubes does not
provide the suction tube with a lumen that, in cross
section, is  crescent shaped.    For example is some versions
of the invention, the tip assembly may be formed so that
lumen of the suction tube has a shape that, in cross
section, is not crescent shaped.     This lumen would at its
widest region be greater in width than the cross sectional
diameter of the associated irrigation tube.     Thus generally
in this invention, when the irrigation tube is disposed in
the suction tube, the lumen of the suction tube has    a shape
in cross section that is not that of ring with constant
inner and outer diameters.    Alternatively one or more webs
that extend from the inner surface of the suction tube that
defines the suction lumen may hold the irrigation tube in
the suction tube.
[000157]   As mentioned above the inventive features of the
tip assembly of this  invention may be used with handpieces
                                45

other than the described handpiece 64.  Thus, the tip
assembly may be used with any handpiece that includes an
irrigation tube through which irrigating fluid is supplied
and a suction tube through which a suction is drawn.   These
handpieces include powered surgical tools  to which a pump is
removably attached.  Two such irrigating handpieces are
disclosed in the Applicant's PCT Pat. App.
No. PCT/US2013/059669, the contents of which are published
in                      and that are now explicitly
incorporated herein by reference.
[000158]  Therefore, it is an object of the appended claims
to cover all such modifications and variations that come
within the true spirit and scope of the invention.
