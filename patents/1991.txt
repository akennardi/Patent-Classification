ABSTRACT
There isprovided an integration of the leakage current functions of an RCD and the voltage sensing functions
of other prior art protection devices. By integrating the two capabilities into one decision making
system/algorithm, and considering the circuits performance in terms of leakage current as it correlated with
elevated protective earth voltages (and vice versa), an embodiment is created which is able to "look into" a
protected electrical system and make much more precise and discerning decisions on electrical status and
probability of unsafe events. The resultant technology attends to the outstanding issues with the prior art
technologies as they stand, and provides a protection solution that covers the entire range of electrical power
wiring configurations and the practical complexities of modern electrical works.

                                                   PROTECTION
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]       The present invention relates to an electrical protection device and a method of providing
electrical protection.
[0002]       Embodiments of the invention have been particularly developed as residual current devices
(RCDs) for use in mains power distribution and will be described herein with particular reference to that
application. However, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to such a field of use, and is
applicable in broader contexts.
BACKGROUND
[0003]       Any discussion of the background art throughout the specification should inno way be considered
as an admission that such art iswidely known or forms part of common general knowledge inthe field.
[0004]       RCD protection technology was invented around the 1960's to provide a tertiary level of electrical
protection against electrocution. RCD technology reacts to leakage of current from an electrical circuit to
implement a protective function should that leakage current exceeds a level that is deemed to be likely to
cause harm to humans.
[0005]       Considerable work has been conducted over the decades as to what level of leakage current is
reasonable to ensure adequate safety. Generally at power frequencies a maximum of 30 mA isconsidered
the accepted limit. Incertain applications this can reduce to 5 mA or increase to as much as 100 mA.
[0006]       Over the last two decades or so electrical circuit current leakage or RCD technologies (referred
within as current leakage) have progressively become widespread in domestic and industrial applications
especially in the developed world. This isdue to their inclusion inmany national safety standards. However at
the same time many deficiencies in the technology have become apparent. In particular it is being
increasingly recognised that there are many circumstances where an RCD will not provide adequate
protection, or where it will be susceptible to false triggers.
[0007]       Inthe decade leading up to 2010 there were a number of technologies developed inan attempt to
address one or more of these deficiencies. One earlier proposed technology sensed the voltage of the
protective metal work of an appliance (irrespective of whether that metal work was connected effectively to
local or remote ground). The technology, which will be referred to as voltage sensing technology, instituted a
protective function if the voltage of the protective metal work moved away from supply neutral in a way that
could potentially expose a human to harm through an electric shock. This technology provides protection
against faults in systems where ground return paths are insufficient (too high resistance) to allow sufficient
leakage current to trip the RCD technology. However, this technology is not readily applicable to MEN

                                                            2
systems in light of the method of operation and the difficulties in achieving compliance with the required
standards for protection circuits.
[0008]        Further known systems monitor current flowing from protective metal work as an alternative to (or
in combination with) monitoring the voltage of the protective metal work. Such systems found in,for example,
PCT publication WO/2010/069011, relates to the other techniques discussed in that: (1)such sentinel (or
fault) current is leakage from the electrical circuit and therefore related to RCD technology - although it is
monitored in a different circuit location; and (2)such leakage currents are as a result of the voltage potential
applied to the protective metal work by an internal fault to the Active conductor and such would also be seen
by voltage sensing technologies.
[0009]        As with voltage sensing, current flow fault sensing relies on an electrical reference (for current
flow it isa current sink and for voltage sensing it isa reference voltage level). This is theoretically different
from RCD circuit current leakage technology that monitors only current leakage (inthe form of active/neutral
imbalance) without reference to where that current isflowing (that is,the sink for such current).
[0010]        Although the above technologies have a similar protection aim of identifying faults which might
cause safety hazards, they use different fault-information collection strategies based respectively on current
and voltage sensing at different locations within the circuit to achieve that aim. Importantly, the strategic
differences are related to voltage reference, current sink, physical location, and fault-impedance differences.
[0011]        As a result there is a correlation between the fault information gathered by each technique. For
example, voltage sensing and current sensing technologies differ inthat current sensing is highly dependent
of the impedance of the fault. Ahigh (non-critical) fault impedance may still result in a significant voltage on
the chassis. However, such a voltage may not be capable of delivering sufficient current to cause harm. With
regards to leakage current technologies, they may sense no imbalance in the circuit due to fault or circuit
characteristics (that is,where earthing ispoor), even when a significant fault occurs. Insuch cases voltage
sensing or current sensing technologies may clearly see a fault signal.
[0012]        An important difference between these forms of protection isdemonstrated on consideration of
floating earth installations. Current Leakage (RCD) technology is often used for well-earthed Multiple Earth
Neutral (MEN) systems (also called TN) as it responds relatively quickly to any current leakage from the
circuit due to a fault to earth (the most common type of fault). However, current leakage technology requires
positive and significant fault current flow before it generates any fault indication. In poorly earthed
environments (such as within TT and ITsystems) such current flow may not occur and therefore RCD sensing
will not receive any fault information.
[0013]        Similarly frame and metal work voltage and current sensing technologies provide fault sensing in
floating systems by providing an independent reference to either measure the result of a fault as active
voltage on the metal chassis or facilitate a small current flow to generate a fault signal. Consequently, in a

                                                              3
well-maintained MEN (TN) system, chassis or electrical metal work sensing may not provide a reliable fault
signal.
[0014]        In summary, known systems and devices may be adequate for some applications. For example,
RCD technologies being most applicable to well earthed MEN or TN type installations while chassis and metal
work voltage and current sensing technologies are most applicable to poor or floating earth installations (TT
and IT).
[0015]        In a further and more recent development, use has been made of both current and voltage
sensing in a single protection device. A device of this type is the subject matter of Australian provisional
patent application no. 2012903629, filed on 22 August 2012. This device has a capability that spans a wider
range of power system configurations and levels of degradation, from earthed-neutral (TN) to floating power
configurations (IT), from new installations to aging and poorly maintained installations. Each technology is
anticipated as independent and separable, with each independently monitoring their respective fault signals
and when either threshold is reached activating a protective function.
[0016]        Notwithstanding better performance than either of the earlier technologies many practical
problems remain ingaining reliable and widespread use of such devices. These problems include:
         *        Asusceptibility to fault triggering as a result of electrical disturbances such as lighting and
          power line transients. These disturbances typically create earth currents through surge devices or
          circuit capacitances, or elevated Ground/Neutral voltages.
         *        Asusceptibility to noise-based false triggering;
         *        Asusceptibility to false or desensitized triggering as a result of electromagnetic coupling with
          adjacent circuits and other circuit effects.
         *        A susceptibility to false or desensitized triggering caused by third party equipment failures
          upsetting common earthing and bonding networks.
         *        Asusceptibility to fault or desensitized triggering as a result of complicated earthing/bonding
          arrangements confusing, or cloaking the fault signal;
         *        High relative cost of alternative techniques.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[00105]        Referring initially to Figure 1,an electrical protection device 1includes two input terminals 2 and 3
for electrically connecting respectively to an active conductor 4 and a neutral conductor 5 of an electrical
power source 10 that is upstream of device 1.Device 1further includes two output terminals 12 and 13 for
electrically connecting to a load 14 having a conductive metal chassis 15 (or electric metal work or casing)
that is downstream of device 1. Load 14 draws a load current at a load voltage. Device 1 includes a first
sensor for providing a first signal derived from the load current, specifically the leakage current from the load.
Furthermore, device 1 includes a second sensor for providing a second signal derived from the voltage on
chassis 15, specifically a current inchassis 15 and avoltage on chassis 15. Furthermore, device 1includes a
processing unit inthe form of a microprocessor 20 isresponsive to the first and second signals for selectively
generating a fault signal. Device 1 also includes a switching unit 21 that is responsive to the fault signal for

                                                            16
progressing from a first state to a second state, wherein: in the first state input terminals 2 and 3 are
electrically connected to output terminals 12 and 13 to allow the load current to be drawn from source 10 to
load 14; and in the second state input terminals 2 and 3 are electrically isolated from output terminals 12 and
13 and prevent the load current being drawn from source 10 to load 14.
[00106]       There isfurther included an earthed sensor line 16 in electrical communication with chassis 15.
Device 1includes afirst sensor input 17 and asecond sensor input 18 for respectively sensing current flowing
from chassis 15 to a current sink and voltage between chassis 15 and a reference voltage in the form of
neutral conductor 5. Insome embodiments the current sink is earth, and in other embodiments the current
sink isneutral conductor 5. Inother embodiments, the reference voltage isother than neutral conductor 5,for
example inone other embodiment the reference voltage isearth.
[00107]       The resistors in Figure 1 are modelling resistors that are indicative of the resistance between the
respective components of the circuit. Specifically: Rgi isthe resistance inthe ground wire from the MEN point
and the load. This resistance may be significant due to poor installation or maintenance practises. Rgdp isthe
resistance between a neutral earth bar 25 and an earth bar 26 within a distribution panel 23. Rg(cust) isthe
customer earth resistance, which is normally the resistance of the wire connection to the earth stake and the
earth stake resistance to actual earth. Rg(sup) isthe resistance between the power supply and actual earth.
All of the resistances (Rgi, Rgdp, Rg(cust) and Rg(sup)) can be relatively large due to, for example, poor
maintenance, poor installation practises or inthe case of the earth, the characteristics of the earth itself.
[00108]       Referring now to Figure 2,this embodiment of device 1 includes circuit leakage (residual current)
technology with chassis voltage sensing. More specifically, there is an integration of the leakage current
functions of the RCD (referred to herein as the RCD sub-system) and a voltage sensing function on the load
chassis 15 (referred to herein as the voltage sensing sub-system). The outputs of each sensing function are
placed on to separate inputs of microprocessor 20. Microprocessor 20 includes integral, analogue to digital
conversion. The signals are digitalised and signal processed by microprocessor 20 and considered in unison
when assessing the need to take protected action. The protective action function isdriven by a single output
of microprocessor 20 (referred to in Figure 2 as GP5 on component U2). By integrating the two capabilities
into one decision making system/algorithm, and considering the performance of the circuit interms of leakage
current as itcorrelated with elevated protective earth voltages (and vice versa), this embodiment of device 1 is
able to investigate a protected electrical system and make much more precise and discerning decisions on
electrical status and probability of unsafe events. The resultant device attends to many of the outstanding
issues with the prior art technologies as they stand, and provides a protection solution that covers the entire
range of electrical power wiring configurations and the practical complexities of modern electrical metal works.

[00110]      It is emphasised that the component values provided in the table above are an indicative example
only and will vary in practice.
[00111]      Figure 2 has five main circuit sub-sections: a Thyristor protective action circuit 201; a power
supply (Vdd) 10 (corresponding to the power supply of Figure 1); the microprocessor 20; a RCD input interface
202; and a Chassis voltage input interface 203.

                                                            18
[00112]       Thyristor protective action circuit 201 is made up of thyristor T2 and a number of surrounding
components. Thyristor T2 istriggered from output GP5 of microprocessor 20. When T2 triggers it connects
the output connection of the contactor solenoid Li to the neutral conductor 5. A large current is driven by
mains voltage through solenoid Li that causes the breaker contactors S1 and S2 to open and disconnect
mains voltage from the circuit and the load, this being the protective action. The surrounding components
around T2 of resistor R18, capacitor C14, resistor R7 and capacitor C8 are to ensure stable operation of the
thyristor. RV1 isa non-linear resistor providing a degree of over voltage protection for the entire circuit.
[00113]       Resistor R10, zener diodes Z4 and Z3, resistor R38 and diode D4 make up a simple DC power
supply for the active components of the circuit. The DC power supply is driven directly from the mains
(switched Active) through solenoid L1.
[00114]       Microprocessor 20, component U2 (PIC1 2F617), isasimple PIC microprocessor with analogue to
digital converter inputs GPO, GP1 and GP2. The microprocessor receives voltages from the RCD and Chassis
voltage sense circuits, digitises them and after appropriate processing (discussed further below) drives the
thyristor protective action circuit through GP5.
[00115]       RCD input interface 202 is made up of leakage transformer T1 feeding operational amplifier Opi.
Any leakage signal from the transformer (which carries both active and neutral current in its duel primary
windings) is amplified by Opi for input into microprocessor 20. Diodes D1 and D2 provide overvoltage
protection. Resistor R4 and capacitor C9 provide a degree of filtering to reduce leakage signal noise. Opi
drives analogue to digital input GP2 through additional filtering resistor R11 and capacitor C5. RCD Test input
isan optional test input for the RCD circuit.
[00116]       Chassis voltage input interface 203 provides sensing by Optoisolator 2 driving GP1 of
microprocessor 20. Connection to the chassis voltage (though sensor wire 16 connection which may be the
protective earth) ismade through resistors R35 and R36. Resistor R36 isa fusable resistor. Variable resistor
RV4 and resistor R36 provide a level of overvoltage protection. Capacitor C13 in combination with resistor
R35 provide noise filtering. Diodes D100 provide a full wave rectification bridge so both positive and negative
cycles of the sense voltage drive current through optoisolator2 primary LED. The output of optoisolator2 is
input to GP1. Switch SW-SPST(TEST) provides a test input for the chassis voltage input interface 203.
[00117]       Referring now to Figure 3,this embodiment of device 1 includes circuit leakage (residual current)
technology with chassis current sensing. More specifically, there is an integration of the leakage current
functions of the RCD (referred to herein as the RCD sub-system) and a current sensing function on the load
chassis 15 (referred to herein as the current sensing sub-system). The outputs of each sensing function are
placed on to separate inputs of microprocessor 20. As with the embodiment of Figure 2, Microprocessor 20 of
the embodiment of Figure 3 includes integral, analogue to digital conversion. The signals are digitalised and
signal processed by microprocessor 20 and considered in unison when assessing the need to take protected

action. The protective action function isdriven by a single output of microprocessor 20 (referred to in Figure 3
as 'GP5' on component 'U2'). By integrating the two capabilities into one decision making system/algorithm,
and considering the performance of the circuit interms of leakage current as it correlated with any current on
the chassis (and vice versa), this embodiment of device 1 isable to investigate a protected electrical system
and make much more precise and discerning decisions on electrical status and probability of unsafe events.
The resultant device attends to many of the outstanding issues with the prior art technologies as they stand,
and provides a protection solution that covers the entire range of electrical power wiring configurations and
the practical complexities of modern electrical metal works.

[00125]      It isemphasised that the component values provided inthe table above are an indicative example
only and will vary in practice.
[00126]      Figure 4 has six main circuit sub-sections: a Thyristor protective action circuit 401; the power
supply (including power source 10, the mains voltage); the microprocessor 20; a RCD input interface 402; a
Chassis voltage input interface 403; and aChassis current input interface 404.
[00127]      Thyristor protective action circuit 401, power supply 10 and RCD input interface 402 of Figure 4
operate identically to thyristor protective action circuits 201 and 301, power supplies 10 and RCD input

                                                            22
interfaces 202 and 302 of Figures 2 and 3 respectively. Furthermore, chassis voltage input interface 403
operates identically to chassis voltage input interface 203 and chassis current input interface 404 operates
identically to chassis current input interface 303.
[00128]       Figure 4 is identical to Figure 2 with the additional chassis current sense capability made from
Op2 and T2. Figure 4 isalso identical to Figure 3 with the additional chassis voltage sense capability made
from Optoisolator2 and full wave rectification bridge provided by diodes D100 and D101.
[00129]       Inthese embodiments the digital fault signals of all the circuit leakage (residual current) and either
of the chassis voltage and the chassis current, or inthe embodiment of Figure 4 both the chassis voltage and
current, sensing are combined within microprocessor 20. An algorithm exists within microprocessor 20 to use
both qualitative (rule driven) and purely quantitative (mathematically or theoretically derived) decision
processes to assess all fault signals in concert. The qualitative and quantitative decision processes involve
time correlation, fast Fourier transform (FFT) and impulse analysis, which will be explained in further detail
below. Itwill be appreciated that, inother embodiments, other forms of quantitative and qualitative analysis is
used.
[00130]       If, in the case of the scenario described above, the less than threshold fault signals from the
leakage current and chassis sensing are received at the same time by microprocessor 20, and the
microprocessor confirms that the two signals are indicative of being from a common fault (when the
frequency, phase, time and impulse behaviour are appropriate characteristics to support such a conclusion)
then the microprocessor can act appropriately to generate the protective action.
[00131]       As isapparent from the disclosure above, the embodiment of Figure 4 includes additional features
over the embodiments of Figures 2 and 3 in that it considers both the chassis voltage and the ability of the
chassis voltage to drive current (as opposed to the embodiments of Figures 2 and 3 that consider one or the
other). Therefore the embodiment of Figure 4 also considers the impedance of the fault. However, the
embodiment of Figures 2 and 3 provide significant improvements over the prior art and are suitable for many
purposes while being a less costly alternative to the device of Figure 4.
[00132]       It is anticipated in a similar way that any two combinations of leakage current, chassis voltage
sensing or chassis current sensing (such as those in the embodiments of Figures 2 and 3) may be used to
provide improvements over the prior art and suitable for many purposes while being a less costly alternative
to the device of Figure 4.
[00133]       As a result, the embodiments of Figures 2,3 and 4 are capable of an integrated decision-making
process, matching voltage and current fault signals interm of magnitude, time and phase from the multiple
sensors to generate the protective function. Moreover, the various selected characteristics of these signals
may be correlated into adecision making algorithm which provides:

                                                             23
        *       Improved leakage current decisions in the RCD mode by considering the signals from the
        voltage and current sensing sub-systems.
        *       Improved ground or protective metal work voltage decisions inthe voltage sensing mode by
        considering the signals from the current sensing and RCD sub-systems.
        *       Improved ground or protective metal work current decisions in the current sensing mode by
        considering the signals from the voltage sensing and RCD sub-systems.
        *       Joint decisions which correlate the leakage current sense signals with the earth and protective
        metal work signals ina combined mode to:
                  i) Anticipate safety situations with improve sensitivity and accuracy, and at an earlier
                        time.
                  ii) Identify safety situations inhigher levels of interference and noise.
                  iii) Identify interference signals (from earth loops, third party faults, and electrical
                        transients etc.) and thus reduce the number of nuisance activations.
[00134]     For example:
              (1) In the case when the leakage current signal is finite but below a threshold to trigger a
                    circuit leakage (residual current) response (due to the fault characteristics), but iscoupled
                    with an elevated but again below threshold voltage sensing signal (as described above), a
                    decision to institute aprotective action will still be prudent in given circumstances.
              (2) In the case where a threshold chassis current signal is apparent but circuit leakage
                    (residual current) signals show no loss of current from the circuit, a protective action may
                    not be generated. Inthis case it isapparent that chassis sense signals are not as a result
                    of a fault which is controlled by the protection, so causing a protective action will only
                    generate a service outage without clearing the fault. Rather, in this case device 1 can
                    provide an alarm for further investigation by technical staff, without causing a unnecessary
                    service outage as would be caused by existing technology.
              (3) Inthe case when the frequency, impulsive behaviour, phase and amplitude modulation of
                    signals do not correlate (that is,the signals are corrupted by noise), either threshold may
                    be varied up or down depending on the criticality of the equipment under supply and the
                    characteristics of the signals and the lack of correlation.
[00135]     Figure 5 provides a flow diagram of the logic that might typically be deployed within the
embodiment of Figure 4. It is emphasised that the embodiments of Figures 2 and 3 would function similarly.
However, the embodiment of Figure 2 would not include a Chassis Current ADC input and the embodiment of

                                                             24
Figure 3 would not include a Chassis Voltage ADC input. As indicated within the flow chart of Figure 5, the
sensory inputs (for circuit leakage, chassis voltage and chassis current) are separately converted to digital
signals within the integral ADC's of microprocessor 20 and these digital streams are thereafter processed
using time correlation, fast Fourier transform (FFT) and impulse analysis functions.
[00136]     As an example these processing functions might look for the following characteristics within the
inputs:
               (1) Peak amplitudes of each of the sensory inputs inboth time and frequency spectrums which
                    can be compared with thresholds levels within the decision engine.
               (2) Time correlation between sensory inputs which would indicate whether or not residual
                    current loss (current leakage) isbeing seen on the chassis of the equipment.
               (3) Frequency correlations between the sensory inputs which thus allowing noise and 3rd party
                    power sources to be separated from faults related to the controlled supply.
               (4) Phase correlation (change) between sensory inputs which indicate the reactive component
                    of the fault impedance including if the fault ispurely resistive indicating an insulation failure
                    of personnel risk.
               (5) Voltage and current correlations between the chassis voltage and current sensory inputs
                    that provides information on the fault impedance.
[00137]     Within Figure 5, the outputs of the time correlation, FFT and impulse analysis are input to the
decision engine. Following isadescription of the decision engine algorithm:
               (1) The first stage of processing within the decision engine considers if any of the sensory
                    inputs are above a minimum threshold to be somewhat indicative of afault. For example, in
                    one embodiment the minimum sensor threshold is set at 5mA for RCD leakage current
                    (where typically 30mA is used as the threshold for RCD technology), 2.5mA for chassis
                    current (where typically the prior art suggests 5mA as the threshold) and 20V for chassis
                    voltage (where typically the prior art suggests something less than 40V). If any of these
                    sensor inputs are exceeded then the decision engine continues to process. If none are
                    exceeded the engine loops back and continues to check for a signal of minimum threshold.
               (2) Ifone of the sensory inputs exceeds minimum threshold the decision engine then checks if
                    any exceed a maximum threshold. For example, in one embodiment the maximum
                    threshold is set at 30mA for RCD leakage current, 20mA for chassis current and 40V for
                    chassis voltage. If any sensory inputs do exceed their respective maximum threshold, then
                    protective action in the form of a fault signal will be triggered electrically isolate the load
                    from the power source.

                                                             25
                (3) In the absence of any one sensory input exceeding maximum threshold, the correlation
                     characteristics of the inputs are checked for clear indications of an equipment fault or
                     safety issue. This iscarried out by checking if two signals are occurring closely correlated
                     in time (therefore are not deemed to be noise) and if the impulse nature of the signals is
                     similar. If there is any order to the signal, this would suggest lightning effects and,
                     therefore, it would be a prudent delay to further processing. The frequencies of the different
                     minimum signals are also checked that they correlate well and the phase makes sense
                     given the likely fault scenarios possibly. Ifthis additional analysis supports a decision to
                     take protective action, then the protective action is triggered. This process is done in
                     multiple decision steps. Within the flow chart two decision steps are described. However, it
                     is appreciated that many other embodiments exist with other numbers and types of
                     decision steps.
                (4) If protective action istriggered, the system is placed ina wait state for outside reset. If no
                     protective action is initiated then the system will return to the start and begin checking
                     threshold levels again.
[00138]      A further key aspect of device 1 is understanding the characteristics of key faults (such as
knowing that the human body ispredominantly resistive). This understanding creates the ability within device
1 to correlate the phase of the RCD leakage signal with that of the voltage sensing signal and exclude
nuisance signals which might otherwise cause a protective function on any of the RCD, current sensing or
voltage sensing sub-systems. Phase difference between the leakage and protective earth signals may
indicate capacitive or induction-caused leakage rather than safety related resistive (human body) earth
leakage. As a result, the combined technology is able to be optimized for sensitivity to events where the
sense signals are inphase and less sensitive when they are not.
[00139]      Device 1 ishoused ina single standardised housing further enhancing the retrofitting of device 1
within an existing switchboard or other location within an electrical distribution system, while offering users
with a familiar form factor.
[00140]      It is also emphasised that device 1 uses a single microprocessor 20 that is responsible for all
decisions including being an input to 'raw' information from the monitored circuit, collating information data
from the monitored circuit and the activation of switches. It isappreciated by those skilled inthe art that the
more than one microprocessor is used in others embodiments where such an applicant is more suited to
multiple microprocessors.
[00141]      Further examples of significant performance advantages available by integrating the decision
process of RCD technology with the voltage sensing technology include:

                                                             26
          *       Improved identification of lighting and power system surge currents, which due to the action of
          surge protection, generate large voltage sensing signals (lighting impulse voltages as sensed by
          voltage sensing sub-system, out of time with subsequent ground leakage current. The time
          separation of such events allows the effective differentiation of such events from safety related faults
          and as such decreases false tripping.
          *       The ability to adapt to aging earthing arrangements to optimize the protective function. When
          especially TT earthing systems age (but in some form all earthing arrangements), ground
          connections deteriorate and go high resistance. In early life, when connections and earth
          arrangements are new and optimal, all earthed systems respond best to RCD style protection.
          During the aging process RCD leakage signals become weak (due to the increasing aging earthing
          and bonding arrangements and the effects of poorly implemented upgrades and add-on works) and
          higher earth resistance voltage sensing protection may start to predominate as the most effective
          form of protection. The integration of both forms of protection into the one decision matrix allows the
          technology to self optimize over the life and provide the maximum protective function.
          *       Improved tolerance to noise as a result of the ability to correlate the frequency of leakage
          current RCD signals against the frequency of protective metal work voltages (the voltage sensing
          signals), separating such signals which when simply considered from a magnitude perspective would
          precipitate a protective reaction. By allowing their separation and separate consideration the
          interference generated by the normal circuit operation of switch mode power supplies, frequency
          converters, solar inverters iseliminated or ameliorated.
[00142]       None of these capabilities or benefits are available in existing standalone RCD, voltage or current
sensing technologies and nor is it gained by the simple combination of the two. To gain the benefit of the
embodiment there isa need to affect the required integration between the functions.
[00143]       Asurprising and unexpected further benefit of integrating the two technologies iscost - a critical
aspect to wide market uptake. More particularly, modern RCD technology ispredominantly implemented with
special purpose, mainly analogue ICs. Many major semiconductor companies manufacture these IC's
including Fairchild, ROHM, TI, and Mitsubishi. They have acommon method of operation including simply low
pass filtering, voltage comparison and adelay latch to remove false triggering caused by surge events.
[00144]       Recently there has been a move to purpose built digital (with limited mixed signal) IC's. Related
research has been documented inpeer reviewed engineering journals.
[00145]       The chassis voltage sensing and current sensing technology mentioned above isnew and, as yet
has not been integrated. The technology presented in Australian provisional patent application no.
2012903629 is analogue discrete with a microcontroller implementing fault tolerance functionality. The
integration of the two technologies as separate functions results in costs being the simple sum of the two

                                                            27
sensing devices. This added (approximately doubled) cost has the potential to considerable restrict market
penetration.
[00146]       The integrated decision making requirement of the present embodiment requires the use of a
single central microcontroller (microprocessor). The low frequency of operation (50 Hz digital signal
processing with millisecond response times) allows the very simple cheap microcontrollers used ubiquitously
throughout domestic and industrial applications for equipment control to be applied to the purpose. These
devices are mass-produced for a range of applications. They are reliable, relatively powerful, well
documented and inexpensive. These devices include relatively powerful analogue to digital on-board
conversion. As a result simple interfaces can be designed to facilitate the required voltage sensing, current
sensing and RCD sensing as shown inthe embodiments of Figures 2, 3 and 4.
[00147]       Such microcontrollers now permit an operational RCD/voltage sensing circuit to be designed
(such as that of Figure 2) that is considerably less expensive than the combined cost of separate RCD and
voltage sensing solutions, and only slightly more costly than RCD circuits alone.
[00148]       The devices herein described are significantly advantageous over the prior art, where the
functionality of the technology remains independent and separable in monitoring their fault signals and when
either threshold is reached, then the protective function will be activated. The present devices, however, have
a capability that spans a wider range of power system configurations and levels of degradation, from earthed
neutral (TN) where the RCD system operates, to floating power configurations (IT) where chassis sensing
systems work, from new installations to aging and poorly maintained installations. This invention is intended to
remedy this unsafe situation as an example of many such scenarios where the present state of the art is
insufficient.
[00149]       In the description provided herein, numerous specific details are set forth. However, it is
understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other
instances, well-known methods, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to
obscure an understanding of this description.
[00150]       Similarly, it is to be noticed that the term connected, when used in the claims, should not be
interpreted as being limited to direct connections or couplings only. The terms "coupled" and "connected,"
along with their derivatives, may be used. It should be understood that these terms are not intended as
synonyms for each other. Thus, the scope of the expression a device A coupled to a device B should not be
limited to devices or systems wherein an output of device A is directly connected to an input of device B. It
means that there exists a path between an output of A and an input of B which may be a path including other
devices or means. "Coupled" or "connected" may mean that two or more elements are either in direct physical
or electrical contact, or that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other but yet still co
operate or interact with each other.

[00151]      Thus, while there has been described what are believed to be the preferred embodiments of the
invention, those skilled in the art will recognize that other and further modifications may be made thereto
without departing from the spirit of the invention, and it isintended to claim all such changes and modifications
as falling within the scope of the invention. Functionality may be added or deleted from the block diagrams
and operations may be interchanged among functional blocks.
