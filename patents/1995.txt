contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]      The present invention relates to a method of cleansing the colon using colon cleansing
solutions, and compositions and kits associated therewith. Colon cleansing compositions are also known
as lavage solutions, bowel cleansers, purgatives or colonic evacuants.
BACKGROUND
[0003]      Colon or bowel cleansing is important before numerous surgical or diagnostic procedures,
including colonoscopy, barium enema examination, sigmoidoscopy and colon surgery. Such procedures
are often carried out on an outpatient basis and thus it is desirable that the colon cleansing be carried out
by the patient at home, prior to arrival at the hospital or surgery where the procedure is to take place. It is
therefore important that patient compliance is good without medical supervision if satisfactory colon
cleansing is to be achieved prior to the procedure.
[0004]      Intestinal lavage, in which a large volume of an electrolyte solution containing sodium sulphate
and polyethylene glycol is ingested, is one of the most common methods for colon cleansing. These
osmotically active agents are non-absorbable or only poorly absorbable and thus retain water in the
bowel, resulting in copious diarrhoea and cleansing of the colon.
[0005]      For effective cleansing, many of these compositions must be ingested in quantities of between 2
to 4 litres. The unpleasant taste of these compositions combined with the large volumes required to be
ingested often contributes to nausea or vomiting, resulting in poor patient compliance and failure to
consume the full volume of solution. Poor patient compliance can lead to inadequate preparation of the
colon which can, in turn, lead to cancellation or repetition of the colonoscopy becoming necessary or,
worse, non-detection of lesions or polyps indicative of cancer risk.
[0006]      A number of improved colon cleansing compositions are described in WO 2004/037292.           A
colon cleansing composition according to WO 2004/037292 that comprises polyethylene glycol 3350,
sodium sulphate, an ascorbate component, electrolytes, sweetener and flavouring is commercialised as a
powder for oral solution under the tradename MOVIPREP* (registered trademark of Velinor AG, a
member of the Norgine group of companies). The MOVIPREP solution is effective despite being taken
in a substantially lower volume than other colon cleansing solutions. Typically, only 2 litres of the

                                                        2
solution need to be taken by an adult patient, a significant benefit when compared to taking 4 litres of
previous solutions.
[0007]     Various regimens for the timing of ingestion of colon cleansing solutions are mentioned in the
literature and in patient information leaflets that accompany colon cleansing products. For example, the
MOVIPREP solution mentioned above may be taken (optionally with additional clear liquids also
optionally being taken) in the evening before the examination or procedure, or the MOVIPREP solution
may be taken in a "split-dose" regimen, with approximately half of the cleansing solution being taken the
evening before the examination or procedure ("first dose"), and the remainder being taken the following
morning ("second dose").
[0008]     Despite the advances that have been made, all colon cleansing products on the market continue
to require a subject to ingest a large volume of solution (2 litres in the case of the MOVIPREP solution).
Many subjects find the ingestion of a large volume unpleasant or difficult and poor patient compliance
thus remains a problem. There remains a need for alternative colon cleansing solutions that are effective
when ingested in small volumes.
[0009]     When comparing the pharmacokinetic profiles of the components of the MOVIPREP solution
(ascorbate component, sodium sulphate, PEG 3350 and electrolytes) in subjects who had taken the
solution in the "evening before" regimen with the pharmacokinetic profiles in subjects who had taken the
solution in the "split-dose" regimen in a clinical study, the present inventors found that a surprisingly
high proportion of the ascorbate component of the first dose of the "split-dose" regimen was absorbed
into the subjects' circulations. The proportion of the ascorbate component that was found to be absorbed
into the circulation was then excreted in the subjects' urine over time, rather than being expelled in
faeces. Whilst this absorption into the circulation is not harmful to the subject, it does reduce the osmotic
strength of the solution, and hence it reduces the solution's ability to cleanse the colon. It is also wasteful
of the component. The finding was surprising in view of the commonly accepted view in the literature
that a maximum of 3g of ascorbic acid can be absorbed in the intestines per day (Hornig, D. et al., Int. J.
Vit. Nutr. Res., 1980, 50, 309). Ascorbate-containing colon cleansing solutions have to date been
formulated on that basis.
DESCRIPTION
[0010]     The invention thus provides, in a first aspect, a colon cleansing solution comprising:
a) 300 to 2000 mmol per litre ascorbate anion provided by ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic
acid, or a mixture thereof; and
b) 10 to 200 g per litre polyethylene glycol.

                                                       3
[0011]     The solution of the invention is a surprisingly effective colon cleansing solution as measured by
stool output, providing satisfactory clearance of stools from the colon with ingestion of a smaller total
volume of solution than with the standard 2 or 4 litre solutions of the prior art.
[0012]     The ascorbate anion may be provided by ascorbic acid, by one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or
by a mixture of ascorbic acid and one or more salts of ascorbic acid. For convenience, they will be
referred to herein as the "ascorbate component". Suitable salts include alkali metal salts and alkaline
earth metal salts. For example a salt may be selected from sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium
salts. For example, preferred salts of ascorbic acid include sodium ascorbate, potassium ascorbate,
magnesium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate. In an embodiment, the ascorbate anion is provided by
ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid selected from sodium ascorbate, potassium ascorbate,
magnesium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate, or a mixture thereof. Particularly preferred salts of ascorbic
acid are magnesium ascorbate and sodium ascorbate, for example sodium ascorbate. In one embodiment,
the solution comprises ascorbic acid and one or more salts of ascorbic acid (and preferably no further
ascorbate), for example ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate (and preferably no further ascorbate), or
ascorbic acid and magnesium ascorbate (and preferably no further ascorbate).
[0013]     The solution of the invention preferably comprises ascorbate anion in a concentration of: 300
1500mmol per litre, for example 300-1200mmol per litre, for example 300-1000mmol per litre, for
example 300-850mmol per litre, for example 350-800mmol per litre, for example 400-700 mmol per litre.
[0014]     Ascorbic acid has a molecular weight of 176g/mol. Accordingly, the 300 to 2000mmol
ascorbate anion per litre can be provided by 52.8 to 352g/litre ascorbic acid.
[0015]     Sodium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 198g/mol. Accordingly, the 300 to 2000mmol
ascorbate anion per litre can be provided by 59.4 to 396g/litre sodium ascorbate.
[0016]     Potassium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 214g/mol. Accordingly, the 300 to 2000mmol
ascorbate anion per litre can be provided by 64.2 to 428g/litre potassium ascorbate.
[0017]     Magnesium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 374.5g/mol and each mole of magnesium
ascorbate provides two moles of ascorbate. Accordingly, the 300 to 2000mmol ascorbate anion per litre
can be provided by 56.2 to 374.5g/litre magnesium ascorbate.
[0018]     Depending on the pH of the solution, some ascorbate anion may be protonated and thus exist as
free ascorbic acid. At the pH of solutions that would typically be administered, only a very minor
proportion of ascorbate is protonated. In calculations of concentrations of "ascorbate anion" herein, the

                                                       4
concentration of "ascorbate anion" is taken as the total concentration of all ascorbate anion present,
including the proportion that is protonated.
[0019]      A solution of the invention comprises 50 to 450g/litre of an ascorbate component, the ascorbate
component being ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid or a mixture of ascorbic acid and one
or more salts of ascorbic acid. For example, a solution of the invention comprises 50 to 300g/litre of
ascorbate component, for example 50 to 200g/litre, for example 60 to 150g/litre, for example 60 to
120g/litre, for example 80 to 120g/litre, for example 100 to 120g/litre.
[0020]      In an embodiment, the ascorbate component consists essentially of sodium ascorbate alone. For
example, it may be present in an amount as mentioned immediately above.
[0021]      In an alternative embodiment, the ascorbate component comprises (or consists essentially of)
sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid. For example, they may be present in a total amount as mentioned
immediately above. They may be in a weight ratio of sodium ascorbate : ascorbic acid from 1:10 to 10:1,
for example 2:8 to 8:2, for example 3:7 to 7:3, for example 1.4:1 to 1.8:1.
[0022]      In an alternative embodiment, the ascorbate component comprises (or consists essentially of) of
sodium ascorbate and magnesium ascorbate. For example, they may be present in a total amount as
mentioned immediately above. They may be in a weight ratio of sodium ascorbate : magnesium
ascorbate from 1:10 to 10:1, for example 2:8 to 8:2, for example 3:7 to 7:3, for example 1.8:1 to 1.4:1.
[0023]      The cleansing solution comprises polyethylene glycol. The polyethylene glycol (PEG) may, for
example, have an average molecular weight of 2000 to 8000, for example 2500 to 4500 Da, for example
3000 to 4000 Da. For example, the PEG may be PEG 3350 or PEG 4000 as defined in national
pharmacopeias. Further examples of suitable PEGs recognized in some national pharmacopeias include
Macrogols, for example Macrogol 3350 or Macrogol 4000.
[0024]      The cleansing solution comprises 10 to 200 g per litre of PEG. Preferably, the solution
comprises 10 to 160g per litre of PEG, more preferably 10 to 120 g per litre, for example 20 to 100 g per
litre, for example 30 to 90g per litre, for example 40 g per litre or 80 g per litre.
[0025]      The cleansing solution may additionally comprise one or more of:
c) one or more electrolytes;
d) one or more alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphates;
e) one or more flavouring agents;
f) one or more sweeteners.

                                                        5
[0026]      The cleansing solution may comprise one or more electrolytes. Electrolytes include salts of
sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, particularly sodium and potassium; and salts of chloride,
iodide, bicarbonate and carbonate, particularly chloride. Preferred electrolytes are sodium chloride and
potassium chloride. In an embodiment, the solution is substantially free from sodium bicarbonate.
[0027]      For example, the solution may comprise sodium chloride at a concentration of 1 to 10 g per
litre. For example, sodium chloride may be present at a concentration of 2 to 8 g per litre, for example 3
to 7g per litre.
[0028]      For example, the solution may comprise potassium chloride at a concentration of I to 10 g per
litre. For example, potassium chloride may be present at a concentration of 1 to 8 g per litre, for example
1.5 to 6g per litre, for example 2 to 5 g per litre.
[0029]      In an embodiment, the solution comprises sodium chloride and potassium chloride. They can
be present in the amounts mentioned immediately above. For example, sodium chloride may be present
at a concentration of 3 to 7g per litre and potassium chloride may be present at a concentration of 2 to 5 g
per litre.
[0030]      The cleansing solution may comprise one or more alkali metal sulphates, alkaline earth metal
sulphates or a mixture thereof (herein referred to as a "sulphate component"). An alkali metal or alkaline
earth metal sulphate may, for example, be selected from sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate and
magnesium sulphate. The solution may comprise more than one of sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate
and magnesium sulphate, for example all three. Preferably, the sulphate component is or includes sodium
sulphate. In an embodiment, the solution does not comprise a sulphate component.
[0031]      For example, the solution may comprise a sulphate component at a concentration of 2 to 20 g
per litre, for example 5 to 15 g per litre, for example 8 to 15 g per litre, for example 10 to 14 g per litre,
for example 12 g per litre. The one or more sulphate salts may be provided in any pharmaceutically
acceptable form: they may each be anhydrous, or be in a hydrated form. The weights mentioned herein
refer to the weight of the sulphate salt excluding any water of hydration.
[0032]      In the solutions of the invention described herein, the quantities of the individual components
recited do not include any solutes that may be present in the water used to prepare the solutions, for
example, in hard water areas there may be significant amounts of Ca2 and Mg> carbonates, bicarbonates
or sulphates present in tap water.
[0033]      The cleansing solution preferably includes a flavouring agent. A flavouring for use in
compositions of the invention should preferably mask saltiness, be relatively sweet but not excessively so,

                                                      6
and be stable in the composition. A flavouring makes the solutions more palatable and thus aids patient
compliance. Preferred flavourings include lemon e.g. Ungerer Lemon (available from Ungerer Limited,
Sealand Road, Chester, England CHI 4LP) strawberry e.g. Ungerer Strawberry, grapefruit e.g. Ungerer
Grapefruit flavouring powder, blackcurrant e.g. Ungerer Blackcurrant, pineapple e.g. IFF (International
Flavours and Fragrances) Pineapple flavouring powder and vanilla/lemon and lime e.g. IFF Vanilla and
Givaudin Roure Lemon and Lime Flav-o-lok. Those and further suitable flavourings are available from
International Flavours and Fragrances Inc. (Duddery Hill, Haverhill, Suffolk, CB9 8LG, England),
Ungerer & Company (Sealand Road, Chester, England CHI 4LP) or Firmenich (Firmenich UK Ltd.,
Hayes Road, Southall, Middlesex UB2 5NN). More preferred flavourings are lemon, kiwi, strawberry
and grapefruit.
[0034]     The amount of flavouring required depends on the nature and strength of the flavouring in
question. Typically, it is 0.05 to 2.0 g per litre.
[0035]     The cleansing solution preferably includes a sweetener. Sugar-based sweeteners are generally
not suited for colon cleansing compositions because the delivery of unabsorbed sugars to the colon
provides a substrate for bacteria. Such sugars may be metabolised by the bacteria to form explosive gases
such as hydrogen and methane. The presence of explosive gases in the colon can be highly dangerous
when electrical apparatus is to be used during colonoscopy or other procedures. Preferred sweeteners
include aspartame, acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K), sucralose and saccharine, and/ or combinations
thereof. For example, compositions of the invention may comprise one or both of aspartame and
acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). For example, compositions of the invention may comprise one or
both of sucralose and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). Alternatively, compositions of the invention
can be substantially free from added sweeteners, for example to minimize the number of different
components in the compositions. Citric acid may also be present as a taste enhancer. Citric acid and/or
salts thereof may replace some or all of the ascorbate in solutions of the invention.
[0036]     The amount of sweetener required depends on the nature and strength of the sweetener being
considered. Typically, it is 0.10 to 1.0 g per litre.
[0037]     The invention thus provides a colon cleansing solution comprising:
a) 300 to 2000 mmol per litre ascorbate anion;
b) 10 to 200 g per litre PEG.
c) one or more electrolytes;
d) optionally one or more alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphates;
e) optionally one or more flavouring agents; and
f) optionally one or more sweeteners.

                                                         7
[0038]     In particular, the invention provides a colon cleansing solution comprising (or consisting
essentially of water and):
a) 300 to 2000 mmol per litre ascorbate anion;
b) 10 to 200 g per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da;
c) sodium chloride and potassium chloride;
d) optionally sodium sulphate;
e) optionally one or more flavouring agents; and
f) optionally one or more sweeteners.
[0039]     Each of c) and d) may be present in the concentrations described above. Each of e) and f) may
be as described above and/or be in the concentrations described above.
[0040]     In particular, the invention provides a colon cleansing solution comprising (or consisting
essentially of water and):
a) 300 to 2000 mmol per litre ascorbate anion;
b) 10 to 200 g per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da;
c) sodium chloride and potassium chloride;
e) one or more flavouring agents; and
f) one or more sweeteners.
[0041]     In one embodiment, the one or more components of c), d) e) and f) are present in the solution.
In an alternative presentation, some or all of components c), d) e) and f) may be provided separately from
the solution, for example in a tablet or capsule. In an embodiment, the solution may comprise a) the
ascorbate component and b) PEG, and optional flavouring and sweetener (e) and f)), and a tablet or
capsule may comprise c) the one or more electrolytes and/or d) the one or more alkali metal or alkaline
earth metal sulphates, again with optional flavouring and sweetener (e) and f)). The flavouring and
sweeteners need not be the same in the tablet or capsule as in the solution.
[0042]     In general it is not necessary for the solutions to include preservatives or anti-oxidants.
Nevertheless, low levels of anti-oxidants or preservatives may be used if required.
[0043]     Preferably, the colon cleansing solution is hyper-osmotic. That is to say that it has a higher
osmotic strength than blood in the human body. It may, for example have a measured osmolality in the
range 500 to 2000 mOsmol/kg. For example, the osmolality may be in the range 700 to 1800 mOsmol/kg,
for example 800 to 1700 mOsmol/kg, for example 900 to 1600 mOsmol/kg, for example 900 to 1300
mOsmol/kg, for example 1000 to 1300 mOsmol/kg.

                                                         8
[0044]     Osmolality can be measured in various ways. In general, either freezing point depression or
vapour-pressure alteration is used. For example, an Advanced Instruments, Inc Model 3250 osmometer
(a freezing point depression device) can be used. Vapour pressure measurement can also be used, for
example using an ELITech Group Vapro 5600 device. Osmolality values cited herein are preferably
taken to be values measured using a freezing point depression osmometer, for example using an
Advanced Instruments, Inc Model 3250 osmometer following standard operating procedure.
[0045]     When carrying out a bowel cleansing treatment, a subject typically takes a single dose or a split
dose of cleansing solution. In a split-dose treatment, typically two doses are taken separated by a time
interval, for example an overnight interval. Each dose in a split dose treatment is smaller than the dose in
the single dose treatment. In a split dose treatment, the two doses may each have the same composition,
or they may be different.
[0046]     For a single dose treatment, the solution of the invention may be taken in a volume of 700 to
1500ml. For example, the subject may take from 750ml to 1300ml of the solution, for example 800 to
1200ml, for example 900 to 1100 ml, for example 1000ml. In an embodiment, the subject may take some
additional clear fluid. The additional clear fluid may be taken after taking the solution. Alternatively, the
additional clear fluid may be co-administered with the intake of the solution of the invention. By "co
administered" is meant the coordinated administration of a solution of the invention with clear fluid.
[0047]     For a split dose treatment, the solution of the invention may be taken with one of the doses
having a volume of 200 to 1000ml. For example, the subject may take 300ml to 1000ml of the solution,
for example 300ml to 900ml, for example 300ml to 800ml, for example 400ml to 700ml, for example 400
to 600ml, for example 450 to 550 ml, for example 500ml. In an embodiment, the subject may take some
additional clear fluid with each or either dose the solution of the invention. The additional clear fluid may
be taken after taking a dose of the solution. Alternatively, the additional clear fluid may be co
administered with the intake of a dose of the solution of the invention.
[0048]     In a split dose treatment, the solution of the invention may be taken for one or for both of the
doses. Preferably, the solution of the invention is taken as the second solution. The first solution may
then be a solution of different constitution from the second solution. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of
a split dose bowel cleansing treatment, a subject takes a dose of an initial cleansing solution, optionally
followed by some additional clear fluid. After an interval, the subject then takes a dose of the solution of
the invention, optionally followed by some additional clear fluid.
[0049]     The volume of clear fluid that a subject takes after the first or second dose may be in a range
with a lower limit of 100ml, 200ml, 300ml, 400ml or 500ml. Preferably, the lower limit is 300ml, 400ml
or 500ml. The volume may be in a range with an upper limit of 1200ml, 11 00ml, l000ml, 900ml or

                                                        9
 800ml. For example the volume may be in the range 100ml to 1200ml, for example 200ml to 11 00ml, for
example 300ml to 1000ml, for example 500ml to 900ml, for example 875ml, for example 500ml to
 800ml. The instructions provided to the subject may suggest that the additional clear fluid is ingested
over a period of approximately one hour, for example in 150 to 200ml fractions every 15 to 20 minutes.
The additional clear fluid may be taken after taking a dose of the solution. Alternatively, the additional
clear fluid may be co-administered with the intake of a dose of the solution of the invention.
 [0050]    A clear fluid for taking as the additional clear fluid, or for use as the clear fluid when making up
a solution, may be any fluid that allows inspection of colonic output. The clear fluid should also not
impede inspection of the colon during the colonoscopy. Typically the clear fluid is a water-based
beverage, including, for example, water, lemonade, cola drinks, cordial drinks, clear fruit juices and even
clear alcohol-containing beverages, for example beer. It is desirable that the clear fluid does not contain
substantial amounts of or essentially any dietary fibre, as such fibre interferes with the cleansing of the
colon according to the present invention. Accordingly, fruit juices, for example orange juice and kiwi
juice, and fruit "squashes" should be strained before use. Clear fruit cordials, for example, lime cordial.,
are generally suitable. In view of the desirability of avoiding drinks containing glucose, so as to reduce
the risk of explosive concentrations of hydrogen or methane building up in the gut, "diet" drinks
containing no or low sugar are especially suitable, for example liquid drinks for diabetics, diet Coke
(RTM), diet lemonade, dietary carbonated drinks or dietary cordials.
 [0051]    The invention further provides a composition (for example a dry composition, for example a
powder) for the preparation of a solution of the invention. A composition can be provided in a quantity
for the preparation of a dose of the solution, for example a 500ml dose. The invention provides a
composition for admixture with water, wherein the composition is optionally presented in two or more
parts and comprises:
a) 150 to 1000 mmol ascorbate anion provided by ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a
mixture thereof; and
b) 5 to 100 g polyethylene glycol.
 [0052]    For example, the components may be in dry powder, granular or other dry form. They may
alternatively be in the form of concentrates or slurries. Components may be in the same or different
physical forms. For example, the composition is a dry composition, for example a dry powder
composition. For example, one or both of components a) and b) are dry powders.
 [0053]    As set out above, the ascorbate anion may be provided by ascorbic acid, by one or more salts of
ascorbic acid, or by a mixture of ascorbic acid and one or more salts of ascorbic acid. Preferred forms of
the ascorbate component are as set out above in relation to solutions of the invention.

                                                      10
[0054]    The composition of the invention preferably comprises ascorbate anion in an amount of: 150 to
750mmol, for example 150 to 600mmol, for example 150 to 500mmol, for example 150 to 425mmol, for
example 175-400mmol, for example 200-350 mmol.
[0055]    Ascorbic acid has a molecular weight of 176g/mol. Accordingly, the 150 to 1000 mmol
ascorbate anion can be provided by 26.4 to 176g ascorbic acid.
[0056]    Sodium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 198g/mol. Accordingly, the 150 to 1000 mmol
ascorbate anion can be provided by 29.7 to 198g sodium ascorbate.

[00140] The second component of the kit of compositions of the invention is preferably a composition
for the preparation of a solution of the first aspect of the invention as described herein above.
[00141] In an embodiment, a kit of the invention has instructions that instruct the user of the volume to
which each component is to be made up with water. For example, the specified volume of water for each

may be contained in separate containers. The other constituents of the second component (for example
one or more of sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium sulphate) may be in either of the separate
containers. For example, they may be in the container containing the PEG.
[00144] If a flavouring component is present in the first or second solution, then in a kit of the invention,
the flavouring component for the relevant solution may be provided in a separate container from the other
constituents of that solution.
[00145]    Examples of suitable containers include tubs, bags and sachets. A preferred container is a
sachet.
[00146] In one embodiment, a kit comprises:
A) a first sachet comprising a first composition for the preparation of the first cleansing solution;
B1) a second sachet;
B2) a third sachet;
wherein the second and third sachets together provide a composition for the preparation of the second
cleansing solution.
[00147] For example, in a kit of the invention as mentioned immediately above:
A) the first sachet comprises polyethylene glycol and/or sodium sulphate;

                                                       24
B 1) the second sachet comprises one or more components selected from polyethylene glycol, one or more
alkali metal sulphates, alkaline earth metal sulphates or a mixture thereof, electrolytes and/or one or more
salts of ascorbic acid; and
B2) the third sachet comprises ascorbic acid;
the one or more salts of ascorbic acid in the second sachet (B1) and the ascorbic acid in the third sachet
(B2) together providing 300 to 2000 mmol per litre ascorbate anion.
[00148] For example, in a kit of the invention as mentioned immediately above:
A) the first sachet comprises:
(i)        70 to 250 g per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 2500 to 4500 Da.
(ii)       2 to 20 g per litre of one or more alkali metal sulphates, alkaline earth metal sulphates or a
mixture thereof
(iii)      optionally one or more electrolytes;
(iv)       optionally one or more flavouring agents; and
(v)        optionally one or more sweeteners,
B1) the second sachet comprises:
(i)        10 to 200g per litre polyethylene glycol,
(ii)       optionally one or more alkali metal sulphates, alkaline earth metal sulphates or a mixture

B2) the third sachet comprises ascorbic acid,
the one or more salts of ascorbic acid in the second sachet (B1) and the ascorbic acid in the third sachet
(B2) together providing 300 to 2000 mmol per litre ascorbate anion.
[00149] For example, in a kit of the invention:

the one or more salts of ascorbic acid in the second sachet (B1) and the ascorbic acid in the third sachet
(B2) together providing 150 to 1000 mmol ascorbate anion.
[00150]    For example, in a further embodiment of a kit of the invention, rather than being provided
within a first sachet (A) with the PEG, some or all of the sulphate(s), electrolytes, flavouring agents and
sweeteners are provided in the form of a tablet or capsule. In a further embodiment of a kit of the
invention, rather than being provided within a second or third sachet (B 1 or B2) with the PEG, ascorbic
acid or ascorbate component, some or all of the sulphate(s), electrolytes, flavouring agents and sweeteners
are provided in the form of a tablet or capsule.
[00151]    A kit may contain one treatment, for example a cleansing treatment, or several treatments. A
treatment generally comprises one dose of the first cleansing solution (or components for preparing the
first cleansing solution) and one dose of the second cleansing solution (or components for preparing the
first cleansing solution). In a kit of the invention, preferably the first component comprises one dose of
the first cleansing solution, and the second component comprises one dose of the second cleansing
solution.
[00152]    A kit of the invention may be for use in a method of cleansing the colon comprising:
- the subject taking an effective amount of a first colon cleansing solution as described herein;
- the subject taking an effective amount of a second colon cleansing solution as described herein.
[00153]    The invention further provides a method of cleansing the colon comprising:
- the subject taking an effective amount of a first colon cleansing solution as described herein;
- the subject taking an effective amount of a second colon cleansing solution as described herein.
[00154]    In the method, there is typically a time interval between taking the first solution and taking the
second solution. Generally, the time interval is at least 4 hours, for example 6 hours or more, for example

                                                       26
8 hours or more. Typically, the time interval is less than 15 hours. The time interval between starting to
take the first cleansing solution and starting to take the second cleansing solution may be, for example,
the time between an evening and the following morning, for example 12 to 16 hours, for example 14
hours. For example, the subject may sleep (for example overnight) between taking the first and second
cleansing solutions.
[00155]    In a fourth aspect, the invention provides a method of cleansing the colon of a subject
comprising:
- administering to the subject an effective amount of a first cleansing solution; and then after a time
interval
- administering to the subject an effective amount of a second cleansing solution,
wherein the second cleansing solution is hyper-osmotic and contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of
ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof; and wherein the first cleansing solution is either substantially free
from ascorbic acid and salts thereof, or contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a
mixture thereof, in an amount providing a lower concentration of ascorbate anion than is present in the
second cleansing solution.
[00156]    For example, the invention provides a method of cleansing the colon of a subject comprising:
- the subject taking an effective amount of a first cleansing solution; and then after a time interval
- the subject taking an effective amount of a second cleansing solution,
wherein the second cleansing solution is hyper-osmotic and contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of
ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof; and wherein the first cleansing solution is either substantially free
from ascorbic acid and salts thereof, or contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a
mixture thereof, in an amount providing a lower concentration of ascorbate anion than is present in the
second cleansing solution.
[00157]    The amount of solution that constitutes an "effective amount" need not be the same for the first
and second solutions.
[00158]    The method provides satisfactory cleansing of the colon whilst not being wasteful of ascorbic
acid component in the first cleansing solution. In addition, the method of the invention provides
satisfactory cleansing of the colon with ingestion of a smaller total volume of the solutions than in the

                                                        27
prior art. The first cleansing solution is preferably a bowel content suspending agent. The second
cleansing solution is a bowel motility agent.
[00159]     The invention also provides a kit comprising:
- a first colon cleansing solution; and
- a second colon cleansing solution,
wherein the second colon cleansing solution is hyper-osmotic and contains ascorbic acid, one or more
salts of ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof; and wherein the first colon cleansing solution is either
substantially free from ascorbic acid and salts thereof, or contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of
ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof, in an amount providing a lower concentration of ascorbate anion in
the first colon solution than is present in the second colon cleansing solution.
[00160]     In some embodiments of the method of the fourth aspect of the invention, the stool output
immediately after the ingestion of the first solution may be less copious than after ingestion of the second
solution. Given that the subject will often wish to sleep between taking the first bowel cleansing solution
and the second solution, it may be advantageous in certain instances for the first cleansing solution to
result in a slightly lower stool output than the second cleansing solution.
[00161]     The invention also provides a kit comprising:
a) a first component, being a composition for the preparation of a first colon cleansing solution by
admixture with a clear fluid (for example water); and
b) a second component, being a composition for the preparation of a second colon cleansing solution by
admixture with a clear fluid (for example water),
[00162]     and optionally instructions for use that specify the volume to which each component is to be
made up with a clear fluid (for example water),
wherein the second colon cleansing solution, when made up to the instructed specified volume with the
clear fluid (for example water), is hyper-osmotic and contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic
acid, or a mixture thereof; and wherein the first colon cleansing solution is either substantially free from
ascorbic acid and salts thereof, or contains, when made up to the instructed specified volume with the
clear fluid (for example water), ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof, in
an amount providing a lower concentration of ascorbate anion in the first colon solution than in the
second colon cleansing solution.

                                                       28
[00163]    In an embodiment, the invention provides a method of cleansing the colon of a subject
comprising:
- administering to the subject an effective amount of a first cleansing solution; and then after a time
interval
- administering to the subject an effective amount of a second cleansing solution,
wherein the first cleansing solution contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and is hyper-osmotic; and
wherein the second cleansing solution contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and is more hyper-osmotic
than the first cleansing solution.
[00164] For example, the invention provides a method of cleansing the colon of a subject comprising:
- the subject taking an effective amount of a first cleansing solution; and then after a time interval
- the subject taking an effective amount of a second cleansing solution,
wherein the first cleansing solution contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and is hyper-osmotic; and
wherein the second cleansing solution contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and is more hyper-osmotic
than the first cleansing solution.
[00165]   Osmolality can be measured in various ways. In general, either freezing point depression or
vapour-pressure alteration is used. For example, an Advanced Instruments, Inc Model 3250 osmometer
(a freezing point depression device) can be used. Vapour pressure measurement can also be used, for
example using an ELITech Group Vapro 5600 device. Osmolality values cited herein are preferably
taken to be values measured using a freezing point depression osmometer, for example using an
Advanced Instruments, Inc Model 3250 osmometer following standard operating procedure.
[00166]   The amount of solution that constitutes an "effective amount" need not be the same for the first
and second solutions.
[00167]   The method of the invention provides satisfactory cleansing of the colon with ingestion of a
smaller total volume of the solutions than in the prior art. The reduced volume requirement helps to
improve patient compliance.
[00168]   For example, the second cleansing solution may comprise ascorbic acid, one or more salts of
ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof. In solution, ascorbic acid and salts thereof provide ascorbate anion.
Depending on the pH of the solution, some ascorbate anion is protonated and thus exists as free ascorbic

                                                      29
acid. At the pH of solutions that would typically be administered, only a very minor proportion of
ascorbate is protonated. In calculations of concentrations of "ascorbate anion" herein, the concentration
of "ascorbate anion" is taken as the total concentration of all ascorbate anion present, including the
proportion that is protonated. Ascorbic acid or salts thereof, contribute to the osmotic load, along with
other solutes. In one embodiment, the first cleansing solution does not contain ascorbic acid or a salt
thereof. Alternatively, the first solution may contain ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or
a mixture thereof. Typically, if the first solution contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic
acid, or a mixture thereof, it contains them in an amount providing a lower concentration of ascorbate
anion than is present in the second cleansing solution.
[00169]     The invention also provides a kit comprising:
- a first colon cleansing solution; and
- a second colon cleansing solution,
wherein the first cleansing solution contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and is hyper-osmotic; and
wherein the second cleansing solution contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and is more hyper-osmotic
than the first cleansing solution.
[00170]     The invention also provides a kit comprising:
a) a first component, being a composition for the preparation of a first colon cleansing solution by
admixture with a clear fluid (for example water); and
b) a second component, being a composition for the preparation of a second colon cleansing solution by
admixture with a clear fluid (for example water),
and instructions for use that specify the volume to which each component is to be made up with a clear
fluid (for example water),
wherein the first cleansing solution contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and, when made up to the
instructed specified volume with the clear fluid (for example water), is hyper-osmotic; and wherein the
second cleansing solution contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) and, when made up to the instructed
specified volume with the clear fluid (for example water), is more hyper-osmotic than the first cleansing
solution.
[00171]     For example, components a) and b) may be in dry powder, granular or other dry form. They
may alternatively be in the form of concentrates or slurries. Components a) and b) may be in the same or

                                                       30
different physical forms. Components within a) and b) may be in the same or different physical forms.
For example, one or both of components a) and b) are dry powders.

interval
- administering to the subject an effective amount of a second cleansing solution,
wherein the first cleansing solution and the second cleansing solution are different, and wherein the first
cleansing solution contains an alkali metal sulphate, an alkaline earth metal sulphate or a mixture thereof;
and the second cleansing solution contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a mixture
thereof.
[00173] The amount of solution that constitutes an "effective amount" need not be the same for the first
and second solutions.
[00174] The first cleansing solution may contain polyethylene glycol (PEG). When made up to the
instructed specified volume with water, it is preferably hyper-osmotic. The second cleansing solution
may contain polyethylene glycol (PEG). When made up to the instructed specified volume with water, it
may be hyper-osmotic, preferably more hyper-osmotic than the first cleansing solution.
[00175] Typically, if the first solution contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a
mixture thereof, it contains them in an amount providing a lower concentration of ascorbate anion than is
present in the second cleansing solution. In an embodiment, the first cleansing solution does not contain
ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof. Typically, if the second solution
contains an alkali metal sulphate, an alkaline earth metal sulphate or a mixture thereof it contains them in
an amount providing a lower concentration of sulphate anion than is present in the first cleansing solution.
In an embodiment, the second cleansing solution does not contain an alkali metal sulphate, an alkaline
earth metal sulphate or a mixture thereof.
[00176] For example, the invention provides a method of cleansing the colon of a subject comprising:

wherein the first cleansing solution and the second cleansing solution are different, and wherein the first
cleansing solution contains an alkali metal sulphate, an alkaline earth metal sulphate or a mixture thereof;
and the second cleansing solution contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a mixture
thereof
[00177] The amount of solution that constitutes an "effective amount" need not be the same for the first
and second solutions.
[00178] The method of the invention provides satisfactory cleansing of the colon with ingestion of a
smaller total volume of the solutions than in the prior art. The reduced volume requirement helps to
improve patient compliance.
[00179] For example, the second cleansing solution may comprise ascorbic acid, one or more salts of
ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof In solution, ascorbic acid and salts thereof provide ascorbate anion.
Ascorbic acid or salts thereof, contribute to the osmotic load, along with other solutes. In one
embodiment, the first cleansing solution does not contain ascorbic acid or a salt thereof. Alternatively,
the first solution may contain ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof
Typically, if the first solution contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a mixture
thereof, it contains them in an amount providing a lower concentration of ascorbate anion than is present
in the second solution.
[00180] The invention also provides a kit comprising:

metal sulphates (the "sulphate component");
d) I to 15g of electrolytes;

                                                      33
e) optionally one or more sweeteners, and
f) optionally one or more flavourings
wherein the sulphate component is in the first cleansing solution and the ascorbate component is in the
second cleansing solution.
[00185] The amount of solution that constitutes an "effective amount" need not be the same for the first
and second solutions.
[00186] The invention further provides a kit comprising two or more compositions for separate
admixture with a clear fluid (for example water) wherein the compositions together comprise the
components:
a) 80 to 250g of a polyethylene glycol;
b) 10 to 150g of ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid or a mixture of ascorbic acid and one or
more salts of ascorbic acid (the "ascorbate component");

e) optionally one or more sweeteners;
f) optionally one or more flavourings
wherein the components are arranged such that the sulphate component is in a first dry composition and
the ascorbate component is in second dry composition.
[00187] For example, the components of the two or more compositions may be in dry powder, granular
or other dry form. They may alternatively be in the form of concentrates or slurries. The two or more
compositions may be in the same or different physical forms. Components within each of the two or
more compositions may be in the same or different physical forms. For example, one or both of the
compositions is a dry powder. The clear fluid may be the same or different for the two or more
compositions.

                                                      34
[00188]    The invention further provides a kit comprising two or more solutions wherein the solutions
together comprise the components:
a) 80 to 250g of a polyethylene glycol;
b) 10 to 150g of ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid or a mixture of ascorbic acid and one or
more salts of ascorbic acid (the "ascorbate component");
c) 1 to 15g of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphate or a mixture of alkali metal or alkaline earth
metal sulphates (the "sulphate component");

e) optionally one or more sweeteners;
f) optionally one or more flavourings
wherein the components are arranged such that the sulphate component is in a first solution and the
ascorbate component is in second solution.
[00189]    For example, each of the first and second compositions (or solutions) may contain some of the
electrolytes of component d). For example, each of the first and second compositions (or solutions) may
contain some of the polyethylene glycol of component a). Alternatively, the polyethylene glycol of
component a) may be contained only in the first composition (or solution). For example, each of the first
and second compositions (or solutions) may contain some of the sweetener of component e). For
example, each of the first and second compositions (or solutions) may contain some of the flavouring of
component f). The first composition (or solution) may contain more of component e) or f) than the
second composition (or solution).
[00190]    In an alternative embodiment, a method, solution or kit is provided wherein the first cleansing
solution and the second cleansing solution have different compositions and, together, comprise the
components:
a) 80 to 250g of a polyethylene glycol;
b) 10 to 150g of ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid or a mixture of ascorbic acid and one or
more salts of ascorbic acid (the "ascorbate component");

                                                        35
c) 1 to 15g of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphate or a mixture of alkali metal or alkaline earth
metal sulphates (the "sulphate component");
d) I to 15g of electrolytes;
e) optionally one or more sweeteners, and
f) optionally one or more flavourings;
wherein the pair of solutions is not a combination in which:
the first solution contains 1Og PEG3350, 3g Na 2 SO 4 , 1.4g NaCl and 0.3g KCl; or the first solution
contains 100g PEG3350, 6g Na 2 SO 4 , 1.6g NaCl and 0.7g KCl; or the first solution contains 100g
PEG3350, 9g Na 2 SO 4 , 2.0g NaCl and 1.0g KCl; and
the second solution contains 40g PEG3350, 3.5g NaCl, 2.2g KCl and 56.6g sodium ascorbate; or the
second solution contains 20g PEG3350, 2.7g NaCl, 1.3g KCl, 33.9g sodium ascorbate and 20.lg ascorbic
acid; or the second solution contains 40g PEG3350, 2.8g NaCl, 3. Ig KCl 33.9g sodium ascorbate and
20. Ig ascorbic acid; or the second solution contains 40g PEG3350, 6g Na 2 SO 4 , 2.8g NaCl, 2.Og KCl and
33.9g sodium ascorbate; or the second solution contains 40g PEG3350, 3.lg NaCl, 1.3g KCl, 33.9g
sodium ascorbate and 21.4g magnesium ascorbate.
[00191]    The combined volume of the first and second cleansing solutions is preferably less than 2 litres.
Preferably, it is 1750ml or less, for example 1500ml or less, for example 1250ml or less. For most adult
subjects, a combined volume of more than 500ml is used, for example more than 750ml. For example, a
combined volume of from 500ml to 1750ml is used, for example from 750ml to 1500ml, for example
from 1000ml to 1500ml, for example 1250ml. For example the first cleansing solution may have a
volume of 750ml and the second cleansing solution may have a volume of 500ml.
[00192]    In an embodiment, the subject may take some additional clear fluid after taking the first
cleansing solution but before taking the second cleansing solution; and/or after taking the second
cleansing solution. In an embodiment, the total amount of additional clear fluid that the subject takes is in
the range 1000ml to 2500ml, for example 1750ml.
[00193]    A clear fluid for taking as the additional clear fluid, or for use as the clear fluid when making up
a solution, may be any fluid that allows inspection of colonic output. The clear fluid should also not
impede inspection of the colon during the colonoscopy. Typically the clear fluid is a water-based
beverage, including, for example, water, lemonade, cola drinks, cordial drinks, clear fruit juices and even

                                                       36
clear alcohol-containing beverages, for example beer. It is desirable that the clear fluid does not contain
substantial amounts of or essentially any dietary fibre, as such fibre interferes with the cleansing of the
colon according to the present invention. Accordingly, fruit juices, for example orange juice and kiwi
juice, and fruit "squashes" should be strained before use. Clear fruit cordials, for example, lime cordial,
are generally suitable. In view of the desirability of avoiding drinks containing glucose, so as to reduce
the risk of explosive concentrations of hydrogen or methane building up in the gut, "diet" drinks
containing no or low sugar are especially suitable, for example liquid drinks for diabetics, diet Coke
(RTM), diet lemonade, dietary carbonated drinks or dietary cordials.
 [00194] The time interval in the method of the invention is generally at least 4 hours, for example 6
hours or more, for example 8 hours or more. Typically, the time interval is less than 15 hours. The time
interval between starting to take the first cleansing solution and starting to take the second cleansing
solutions may be, for example, the time between an evening and the following morning, for example 12
to 16 hours, for example 14 hours. For example, the subject may sleep (for example overnight) between
taking the first and second cleansing solutions. The time between finishing taking the first solution and
starting to take the second solution is somewhat less, and that depends on the time the subject takes to
complete the first solution. Typically, the first solution is taken over a period of up to two hours, for
example an hour. Therefore the time between finishing taking the first solution and starting to take the
second solution is for example 11 to 15 hours, for example 13 hours.
 [00195] During the time interval between the administration of the first cleansing solution and the
second cleansing solution, the subject may additionally take a stimulant laxative (also known as a
prokinetic agent). A stimulant laxative can assist in bringing about good cleansing. Examples of
stimulant laxatives include contact laxatives, for example bisacodyl, castor oil or senna. Examples of
stimulant laxatives also include additional osmotic agents for example magnesium salts, for example
magnesium citrate. If a stimulant laxatives is included in the regimen, the length of the time interval can
be shortened. For example, it may be I to 15 hours, for example I to 12 hours, for example 2 to 10 hours.
 [00196] During the time interval between the administration of the first cleansing solution and the
second cleansing solution, it is very likely that the subject will experience a bowel movement.
Advantageously, the subject waits until the bowel movement has occurred before taking the second
cleansing solution.
 [00197] The second cleansing solution, and optionally the first cleansing solution contains ascorbic acid,
one or more salts thereof, or a mixture thereof. For convenience, they will be referred to herein as the
"ascorbate component".

                                                       37
[00198]    Suitable salts of the ascorbic acid include alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts. For
example, preferred salts of ascorbic acid include sodium ascorbate and magnesium ascorbate. In an
embodiment, one of sodium ascorbate and magnesium ascorbate is present.
[00199]    In one embodiment, the ascorbate component comprises both ascorbic acid and one or more
salts of ascorbic acid. For example, the ascorbate component may comprise ascorbic acid and sodium
ascorbate. For example, the ascorbate component may comprise ascorbic acid and magnesium ascorbate.
[00200] In an embodiment, a mixture of salts of ascorbic acid is used. For example, both sodium
ascorbate and magnesium ascorbate may be present. They may be present with ascorbic acid, or without
ascorbic acid.
[00201] The second cleansing solution contains a higher concentration of ascorbate anion than is present
in the first cleansing solution. For example, the second cleansing solution contains twice the
concentration of the ascorbate anion than the first cleansing solution or more. For example, the second
solution contains three times or more, four times or more, or five times or more the concentration of the
ascorbate anion than the first cleansing solution. For example, the second cleansing solution contains a
concentration of the ascorbate anion that is at least 50mmol per litre greater than that of the first cleansing
solution. That is to say that the second solution contains a concentration of ascorbate anion that is at least
50mmol per litre greater than that of the first solution. For example, the second solution contains a
concentration of the ascorbate anion that is greater by at least 100mmol per litre, for example at least
200mmol per litre, at least 300mmol per litre.
[00202] For example, the first cleansing solution may be substantially free from an ascorbate
component.
[00203]    For example, the second cleansing solution may comprise:
- 56.6g sodium ascorbate, or
- 33.9g sodium ascorbate and 20.lg ascorbic acid, or
- 33.9g sodium ascorbate, or
- 33.9g sodium ascorbate and 21.4 g magnesium ascorbate.
[00204] The second cleansing solution may further comprise polyethylene glycol. The polyethylene
glycol (PEG) may, for example, have an average molecular weight of 2500 to 4500 Da, for example 3000
to 4000 Da. For example, the PEG may be PEG 3350 or PEG 4000 as defined in national pharmacopeias.
Further examples of suitable PEGs recognized in some national pharmacopeias include Macrogols, for
example Macrogol 4000.

                                                      38
[00205] For example, the second cleansing solution may comprise 20g or 40g PEG 3350. For example,
the second cleansing solution may have a volume of 500ml.
[00206] The first cleansing solution may comprise polyethylene glycol and/or an alkali metal sulphate,
an alkaline earth metal sulphate, or a mixture thereof.
[00207] The polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the first cleansing solution may be as described immediately
above for the second cleansing solution. The PEG in the first cleansing solution can be a different PEG
from the PEG in the second cleansing solution. For example, one PEG may be PEG3350 and the other
PEG may be PEG4000. For example, the first cleansing solution may comprise 100g PEG 3350.               For
example, the first cleansing solution may have a volume of 750ml.
[00208] The first cleansing solution preferably comprises an alkali metal sulphate, an alkaline earth
metal sulphate or a mixture thereof. An alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphate may, for example, be
selected from sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate and magnesium sulphate. The solution may comprise
more than one of sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate and magnesium sulphate, for example all three.
Preferably, the alkali metal sulphate, an alkaline earth metal sulphate or the mixture thereof is or includes
sodium sulphate. Preferably, an alkali metal sulphate or alkaline earth metal sulphate (for example
sodium sulphate) is anhydrous.
[00209] For example, the first cleansing solution may have a volume of 750ml and comprise 3g, 6g or
9g of sodium sulphate.
[00210] The first and/or second cleansing solution(s) may further comprise one or more of:
a) one or more electrolytes;
b) one or more flavouring agents;
c) one or more sweeteners.
[00211] Electrolytes include salts of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, particularly sodium
and potassium; and salts of chloride, iodide, bicarbonate and carbonate, particularly chloride. Preferred
electrolytes are sodium chloride and potassium chloride. In an embodiment, the first and/or second
solution is substantially free from sodium bicarbonate.
[00212] For example, the first cleansing solution may have a volume of 750ml and comprise 1.4g
sodium chloride and 0.3g potassium chloride; or 1.6g sodium chloride and 0.7g potassium chloride; or
2.Og sodium chloride and 1.Og potassium chloride.

                                                      39
[00213] For example, the second cleansing solution may have a volume of 500ml and comprise 3.5g
sodium chloride and 2.2g potassium chloride; or 2.7g sodium chloride and 1.3g potassium chloride; or
2.8g sodium chloride and 1.3g potassium chloride; or 2.8g sodium chloride and 2.0g potassium chloride;
or 3. Ig sodium chloride and 1.3g potassium chloride. For example the second cleansing solution is
substantially free from sodium bicarbonate.
[00214] In the solutions of the invention described herein, the quantities of the individual components
recited do not include any solutes that may be present in the water used to prepare the solutions, for
example, in hard water areas there may be significant amounts of Ca2 and Mg2 + carbonates, bicarbonates
or sulphates present in tap water.
[00215] The first and/or second cleansing solution(s) preferably include a flavouring agent. Flavouring
for use in compositions of the invention should preferably mask saltiness, be relatively sweet but not
excessively so, and be stable in the composition. Flavouring makes the solutions more palatable and thus
aids patient compliance. Preferred flavourings include lemon e.g. Ungerer Lemon (available from
Ungerer Limited, Sealand Road, Chester, England CHI 4LP) strawberry e.g. Ungerer Strawberry,
grapefruit e.g. Ungerer Grapefruit flavouring powder, blackcurrant e.g. Ungerer Blackcurrant, pineapple
e.g. IFF (International Flavours and Fragrances) Pineapple flavouring powder and vanilla/lemon and lime
e.g. IFF Vanilla and Givaudin Roure Lemon and Lime Flav-o-lok. Those and further suitable flavourings
are available from International Flavours and Fragrances Inc. (Duddery Hill, Haverhill, Suffolk, CB9
8LG, England), Ungerer & Company (Sealand Road, Chester, England CHI 4LP) or Firmenich
(Firmenich UK Ltd., Hayes Road, Southall, Middlesex UB2 5NN). More preferred flavourings are
lemon, kiwi, strawberry, grapefruit and orange. The most preferred flavourings are lemon flavour and
orange flavour.
[00216] The first and/or second cleansing solution(s) preferably include a sweetener. Sugar-based
sweeteners are generally not suited for colon cleansing compositions because the delivery of unabsorbed
sugars to the colon provides a substrate for bacteria. Such sugars may be metabolised by the bacteria to
form explosive gases such as hydrogen and methane. The presence of explosive gases in the colon can be
highly dangerous when electrical apparatus is to be used during colonoscopy or other procedures.
Preferred sweeteners include aspartame, acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K), sucralose and saccharine,
and/ or combinations thereof. For example, compositions of the invention may comprise one or both of
aspartame and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). For example, compositions of the invention may
comprise one or both of sucralose and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). Alternatively, compositions
of the invention can be substantially free from added sweeteners, for example to minimize the number of
different components in the compositions. Citric acid may also be present as a taste enhancer.

                                                      40
[00217]   As mentioned above, in the various embodiments of the fourth aspect of the invention, the first
or second solution may include electrolytes. In an alternative embodiment, some or all of the electrolytes
may be provided in a tablet or capsule for co-administration with the respective solution. A tablet or
capsule may include sweetener or flavouring.
[00218]   The first cleansing solution may, for example, have a measured osmolality in the range 200 to
1500 mOsmol/kg. In a preferred embodiment, it is hyper-osmotic (that is to say that it has a higher
osmotic strength than blood in the human body). It may, for example, have a measured osmolality in the
range 320 to 1500 mOsmol/kg. For example, the measured osmolality of the first cleansing solution is in
the range 330 to 1200 mOsmol/kg, for example 340 to 1000 mOsmol/kg, for example 350 to 800
mOsmol/kg, for example 350 to 700 mOsmol/kg.
[00219]   The second cleansing solution is hyper-osmotic. That is to say that it has a higher osmotic
strength than blood in the human body. It may, for example, have a measured osmolality in the range 500
to 2000 mOsmol/kg. For example, the osmolality may be in the range 700 to 1800 mOsmol/kg, for
example 800 to 1700 mOsmol/kg, for example 900 to 1600 mOsmol/kg, for example 900 to 1300
mOsmol/kg, for example 1000 to 1300 mOsmol/kg.
[00220] In an embodiment, the second cleansing solution is more hyper-osmotic than the first cleansing
solution. For example, the ratio between the osmolality of the second cleansing solution and the
osmolality of the first cleansing solution is from 6:1 to 1.3:1. For example, the ratio is from 5:1 to 1.3:1,
for example from 3.5:1 to 1.5:1, for example from 2.5:1 to 1.6:1.
[00221] Osmolality can be measured in various ways. In general, either freezing point depression or
vapour-pressure alteration is used. For example, an Advanced Instruments, Inc Model 3250 osmometer
(a freezing point depression device) can be used. Vapour pressure measurement can also be used, for
example using an ELITech Group Vapro 5600 device. Osmolality values cited herein are preferably
taken to be values measured using a freezing point depression osmometer, for example using an
Advanced Instruments, Inc Model 3250 osmometer following standard operating procedure.
[00222] In general it is not necessary for the solutions to include preservatives or anti-oxidants.
Nevertheless, low levels of anti-oxidants or preservatives may be used if required.
[00223]   The method of the invention may be used to cleanse the colon prior to carrying out a diagnostic,
therapeutic or surgical procedure on the colon, rectum or anus or elsewhere in the abdomen in a subject.
The subject is most preferably a human. The diagnostic or surgical procedure may, for example, be
colonoscopy, barium enema examination, sigmoidoscopy (for example flexible sigmoidoscopy) or colon
surgery. The method of the invention may be a method of cleansing the colon prior to a surgical or

                                                       41
diagnostic procedure comprising administering the first solution and then after a time interval
administering the second solution prior to said procedure.
[00224] The solutions, compositions and kits described herein also find use in the treatment of
constipation and faecal impaction. The invention thus provides solutions, compositions and kits as
described herein for use in the treatment of constipation or faecal impaction. The invention also provides
methods of treating constipation or faecal impaction comprising administration of solutions as described
herein.
[00225]     The invention further provides a kit comprising:
- a first colon cleansing solution; and
- a second colon cleansing solution,
wherein the second colon cleansing solution is hyper-osmotic and contains ascorbic acid, one or more
salts of ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof; and wherein the first colon cleansing solution is either
substantially free from ascorbic acid and salts thereof, or contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of
ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof, in an amount providing a lower concentration of ascorbate anion in
the first colon solution than is present in the second colon cleansing solution.
[00226]     A kit may further comprise instructions for use. The use may be as described above in relation
to methods of the invention.
[00227]     In a kit of the invention, the components of the first and second solutions are as described
hereinabove in relation to the methods of the invention.
[00228]     The invention further provides a first solution, and a second solution, for use in a method of
cleansing the colon of a subject comprising:
- the subject taking an effective amount of a first cleansing solution; and then after a time interval
- the subject taking an effective amount of a second cleansing solution,
wherein the second cleansing solution is hyper-osmotic and contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of
ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof; and wherein the first cleansing solution is either substantially free
from ascorbic acid and salts thereof, or contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a
mixture thereof, in an amount providing a lower concentration of ascorbate anion than is present in the
second cleansing solution.

                                                       42
[00229]     The invention further provides a solution that is hyper-osmotic and contains ascorbic acid, one
or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof, for use in a method of cleansing the colon of a subject
comprising:
- the subject taking an effective amount of a first cleansing solution; and then after a time interval
- the subject taking an effective amount of a second cleansing solution,
wherein the second cleansing solution is hyper-osmotic and contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of
ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof; and wherein the first cleansing solution is either substantially free
from ascorbic acid and salts thereof, or contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a
mixture thereof, in an amount providing a lower concentration of ascorbate anion than is present in the
second cleansing solution.
[00230]     The solutions for use in a method of cleansing the colon in accordance with the invention are as
described hereinabove in relation to the methods of the invention.
[00231]     In an embodiment, the invention provides a kit comprising:
a) a first component, being a composition for the preparation of a first colon cleansing solution by
admixture with a clear fluid (for example water); and
b) a second component, being a composition for the preparation of a second colon cleansing solution by
admixture with a clear fluid (for example water),
and instructions for use that specify the volume to which each component is to be made up with water,
wherein the second colon cleansing solution, when made up to the instructed specified volume with the
clear fluid (for example water), is hyper-osmotic and contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic
acid, or a mixture thereof; and wherein the first colon cleansing solution is either substantially free from
ascorbic acid and salts thereof, or contains, when made up to the instructed specified volume with the
clear fluid (for example water), ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof, in
an amount providing a lower concentration of ascorbate anion in the first colon solution than in the
second colon cleansing solution.
[00232]     The constituent parts of the composition for the preparation of a first cleansing solution by
admixture with water are, for example, as described hereinabove in relation to the first solution in the
methods of the invention. The constituent parts of the composition for the preparation of a second

                                                         43
cleansing solution by admixture with water are, for example, as described hereinabove in relation to the
second solution in the methods of the invention.
[00233]    For example, components a) and b) may be in dry powder, granular or other dry form. They
may alternatively be in the form of concentrates or slurries. Components a) and b) may be in the same or
different physical forms. Components within a) and b) may be in the same or different physical forms.
For example, one or both of components a) and b) are dry powders.
[00234] In an embodiment, a kit of the invention has instructions in which the specified volume of water
for each solution is less than one litre. For example, the combination of the specified volumes of the first
and second cleansing solutions is preferably less than 2 litres. Preferably, it is 1750ml or less, for
example 1500ml or less, for example 1250ml or less. For most adult subjects, a combined volume of
more than 500ml is used, for example more than 750ml. For example, a combined volume of from 500ml
to 1750ml is used, for example from 750ml to 1500ml, for example from 1000ml to 1500ml, for example
1250ml. For example a volume of 750ml may be specified for the first cleansing solution and a volume
of 500ml may be specified for the second cleansing solution. The instructions may specify that a
cleansing solution is consumed immediately after it has been prepared. They may specify that the
cleansing solution is prepared and then stored in a fridge before consumption at a slightly later time.
[00235]    In general, the instructions specify that the first and second solutions are to be ingested in
succession with a time interval between them. In an embodiment, the instructions specify that the first
cleansing solution is ingested first followed, after a time interval (for example the time between an
evening and the following morning) by ingestion of the second cleansing solution. The time interval is
preferably as described above in relation to the methods of the invention.
[00236]    It is convenient for the patient for a kit of the invention to be provided in the form of, for
example, a box. In a kit of the invention the first and/or second components may each be contained in
one or more containers. In particular, the second component may be contained in more than one
container. For example, if the second component comprises both ascorbic acid and PEG then the ascorbic
acid and PEG may be contained in separate containers. The other constituents of the second component
(for example one or more of sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium sulphate) may be in either
of the separate containers. For example, they may be in the container containing the PEG.
[00237]    If a flavouring component and/or sweetening component is present in the first or second
solution, then in a kit of the invention, the flavouring and/or sweetener component for the relevant
solution may be provided in a separate container from the other constituents of that solution.
Alternatively, the flavouring and/or sweetener may be in the same container as one or more other
components. For example, any flavouring or sweetener may be in the same container as PEG.

sachet.
[00239]     In one embodiment, a kit comprises:
a) a first sachet comprising a first composition for the preparation of a first cleansing solution;
b) a second sachet;
c) a third sachet;
and instructions for use
wherein the second and third sachets together provide a composition for the preparation of a second colon
cleansing solution, and
wherein the first and second cleansing solutions are as described herein-above.
[00240] For example, in a kit of the invention as mentioned immediately above:
a) the first sachet comprises polyethylene glycol and/or sodium sulphate, optional flavouring and/or
optional sweetener;

ascorbate); and wherein the first cleansing solution is either substantially free from ascorbic acid and salts
thereof, or contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof, in an amount
providing a lower concentration of ascorbate anion than is present in the second cleansing solution. The
second cleansing solution may comprise PEG and electrolytes (for example sodium chloride and
potassium chloride). The first solution may comprise PEG; it may comprise an alkali metal or alkaline
earth metal sulphate (for example sodium sulphate); it may comprise electrolytes (for example sodium
chloride and potassium chloride). There are also provided kits comprising a first and a second solution
according to the invention, and kits comprising compositions for preparing the first and second solutions.
EXPERIMENTAL
[00250]    Pharmacokinetic evaluation and mass balance study
[00251]    An investigation into the pharmacokinetics and mass balance of a solution in water of
MOVIPREP powder for oral solution was carried out following oral administration using single dose or
split dose intake in healthy male subjects.
[00252]    Subjects:
The subjects were healthy male volunteers aged 18 to 45 years. The subjects' written informed consent
was obtained. The subjects were willing, able and competent to complete the procedure and to comply
with the study instructions. The subjects had to not meet any of the exclusion criteria. 24 subjects were
randomly allocated into two groups: 12 into the single-dose group and 12 into the split-dose group.

                                                       47
[00253]    Study medication:
The study medication administered was a solution in water of MOVIPREP powder for oral solution. The
total dose was 2 litres of the solution for each subject. The solution contains, per litre:
PEG3350: 100g
Sodium Sulphate: 7.500g
Ascorbic Acid: 4.700g
Sodium Ascorbate: 5.900g
Sodium chloride: 2.691g
Potassium chloride: 1.015g
Lemon-flavour and Sweetener
[00254] The 4.700g ascorbic acid and 5.900g sodium ascorbate together provide the equivalent of
9.944g ascorbic acid. A 2 litre dose thus provides the equivalent of 19.89g of ascorbic acid.
[00255]    Treatment Regimens:
[00256]    The single dose group took the solution as follows:
2L of solution were consumed between 17:00 and 20:00 on Day -1. The first litre was consumed within
the first hour, with at least 500ml of additional clear fluid. The second litre was consumed within two
hours, with at least 500ml of additional clear fluid.
[00257]    The split dose group took the solution as follows:
IL of solution was consumed between 18:00 and 19:30 on Day -1. The litre was consumed within the 90
minutes, with at least 500ml of additional clear fluid. The second litre was consumed between 07:00 and
08:30 on Day 0 (the day on which a colonoscopy procedure would be carried out in a clinical situation).
The litre was consumed within the 90 minutes, with at least 500ml of additional clear fluid.
[00258]    Sample collection for monitoring of PK parameters in blood and recovery of components in
faeces and urine:
[00259]    Urine and faeces were collected throughout the procedure. Cumulative content amounts of
components under investigation in the urine were obtained from measured concentrations of the
components and measured actual volume of urine. Similarly, the cumulative content amounts of
components under investigation in the faeces were obtained from measured concentrations of the
components and measured actual mass of faeces. The defined time points for analysis of urine and faeces
were at Ohr, 2hr, 4hr, 8hr, 12hr, 12.97hr, 18hr, 24hr, 25.93hr, 36hr, 48hr, 60hr, 72hr and 120hr after the

                                                          48
start of intake of the first litre of study medication. Blood samples were collected from the subjects at
particular time points through the procedure.
[00260]     Sample evaluation:
[00261]     The cumulative amounts of ascorbic acid, PEG3350, chloride, sulphate, sodium and potassium
in plasma, faeces and urine were evaluated. The PK profiles of ascorbic acid, PEG3350, chloride,
sulphate, sodium and potassium in the plasma were evaluated. Plasma renin and aldosterone were
checked at all PK time points.
[00262]     For higher accuracy, the analysis of the recovery of ascorbic acid was extended to include also
its metabolites dehydro-ascorbic acid and oxalic acid in urine and faeces.
[00263]     Completion of study:
[00264] Of the 12 subjects in the single-dose group, 4 had to be excluded from the analysis due to
protocol violations, so 8 subjects were evaluated.
[00265]     Of the 12 subjects in the split-dose group, 1 had to be excluded from the analysis due to
protocol violations, so 11 subjects were evaluated.
[00266]     Results:
[00267]     General:
[00268]     The mean cumulative recovery of ascorbic acid (including metabolites dehydroascorbic acid
and oxalic acid) and PEG3350 in faeces and urine was comparable for the subjects in both treatment
groups. The data collected on the cumulative amount of chloride, sulphate, sodium and potassium were
comparable between the subjects in both treatment groups insofar as there was a continuous elimination
in urine plus faeces (i.e. no plateau was reached). Furthermore, the PK parameters (AUCO_,           AUCiast,
Cmax, K,, Vd    and t 1 /2) determined for ascorbic acid, sulphate, chloride, sulphate, sodium and potassium
were comparable for the subjects in the single dose and the split dose group; especially the values for
AUCiast   (i.e. exposure) were nearly identical for both groups.
[00269]     Recovery and mass balance of ascorbic acid:
[00270]     The ascorbic acid was to a significant extent excreted in faeces. The cumulative recovery of
ascorbic acid and its metabolites from 0 to 120 hours after the start of intake of the first litre of study
medication is shown in Table 1 for the single-does group and in Table 2 for the split-dose group. In the

metabolites) at the stated time points. That information in Tables 1 and 2 is taken from the graphs shown
in Figures 1 and 2 respectively.

[00273]    Discussion:
[00274] Of the 19.89 g ingested ascorbic acid equivalents contained in 2 litres of MOVIPREP solution
103.35% were found to be recovered in urine and faeces of the single-dose group subjects after 120 hours,
and 103.05% were found to be recovered in urine and faeces of the subjects in the split-dose group after
120 hours. There was no statistically significant difference between the total recovered amount of
ascorbic acid between the two groups.
[00275]    There was, however, a difference between the timing of the recovery and between the
distribution of the ascorbic acid between urine and faeces. It is seen in Tables 1 and 2 that in the split
dose group, the distribution of the total recovered 20.32g ascorbic acid between urine and faeces is in the
ratio 9.123g : 11.195g, ie 44.9% : 55.10% (or 1:1.23) whilst, in the single dose group, the distribution of
the total recovered 20.54g ascorbic acid between urine and faeces is in the ratio 6.50 1g : 14.041g, ie
31.6% : 68.4% (or 1:2.16).
[00276]    The final column of each of Tables 1 and 2 shows the plasma level of ascorbate/ascorbic acid at
the stated time points. The measurement does not include metabolites of ascorbic acid, and it does not
take account of ascorbate in other compartments in the body. Nevertheless, increases in plasma ascorbate
are clearly seen in the hours following administration of the solution.
[00277]    In order to compare the recovery of ascorbic acid during the different phases of the protocol,
two time intervals were defined: the first time interval was between time zero, i.e. the start of the intake
of the first litre of study medication and time "x", where "x" represents the minimal starting time point of
the intake of the second litre of study medication for split dose group (from time 0 to 12.97 hrs). The
second time interval was from time "x" to time 2x (from 12.97 to 25.93 hrs).

                                                          52
[00278]   It is seen that, during the second time interval, 6.025g of ascorbic acid are recovered from
faeces of the split-dose group, compared with 5.022g during the first time interval. The 6.025g in the
second time interval is closer to being half of the 13.587g seen over the first time interval in the single
dose group. That is to say that the second dose of the split-dose treatment follows a similar time course to
the (only) dose in the single-dose treatment.
[00279]   The differences in the recovered amounts of components between the first and the second time
intervals are statistically significant for ascorbic acid (incl metabolites) in faeces (p=0.0078) and urine
plus faeces (p=0.0078) for the single dose group subjects, and in urine (p=0.0020) and urine plus faeces
(p=0.0322) of the split dose group subjects.

[00286]    The solutions additionally contained sweetener and flavouring sufficient to improve their
palatability.  In the case of the solutions in Table 4, those components were in sachet A. The solutions
were not optimised for palatability.
[00287]    Example lb - V(350) Osmolality measurements:
In order to assess the osmotic strength of the solutions, it was determined how much water was required
to provide a solution with measured osmolality of 350mOsmol/kg from the amounts of the components in
Tables 3 and 4.
[00288]    To each solution prepared by dissolving the components in Tables 3 and 4 above in 500ml of
deionised was added further deionised water until it reached an osmolality of 350mOsmol/kg. After a
volume was found in a first experiment, a second experiment was carried out in which the volume of
water found in the first experiment was added to the contents of a new sachet in one aliquot. It was then
checked that the resulting solution had an osmolality of 350 +/- 7 mOsmol/kg. In every case, it did. The
volumes are recorded in Tables 3 and 4 in the final columns. Osmolalities were measured using an

                                                       54
Advanced Instruments, Inc Model 3250 osmometer. The osmometer was operated following standard
instructions: after the device passes a calibration check, the "Low Range" osmolality range (0 to 2000
mOsmol/kg) is selected, and a sample tube containing 250 l of sample solution is placed in the freezing
chamber. The "start" button is then pressed. When the measurement is completed, the device displays
the measurement result and that is recorded.
[00289]   Example 2: Bowel cleansing of subjects
[00290]   An open, randomised, single centre phase I study to investigate the pharmacodynamic effects
(stool weight) of the various modified gut cleansing solutions. The study had two sequential parts (Part 1
and Part 2). In both parts investigational medicinal product (IMP) was administered in the evening of
Day 1 and the morning of Day 2. In Part 1 of the study, three different solutions A given in the evening
were combined in turn with a fixed solution B given in the morning. In addition, one group of subjects
received MOVIPREP@, as reference product.
[00291]   In Part 2 of the study, the selected solution A from Part 1 was given as the evening dose in
combination with four different solutions B as the morning dose. Stool output was assessed.
[00292]   Number of patients (planned and analysed):
[00293]   Planned: at least 160 evaluable cases in the entire study (20 evaluable subjects per treatment
group)
[00294] Analysed: 161 evaluable cases (part A: 81 subjects; part B: 80 subjects). Patients were
subjected to inclusion and exclusion criteria.
[00295]   Dosage regimen:
[00296]   Each subject received his/her solution regimen in the split dose intake:
[00297]   Evening dose: Day 1; start intake between 17:00 and 18:00 pm for an intake period of up to
2 hours after fasting from 14:00 pm.
[00298]   Morning dose: Day 2; start intake between 7:00 and 8:00 am for an intake period of up to
2 hours. 4 hours after complete intake of the morning dose, the first meal was provided, but not before
completion of the planned safety laboratory blood drawing.
[00299]   After the end of the intake of each dose of the investigational solution, the subjects were
instructed to take further clear liquid (water).

                                                       55
[00300]   Screened healthy subjects provided one stool collection after a complete bowel motion in the
7 days before the planned admission to the unit for baseline evaluation. After admission to the unit, all
defecated faeces were collected after each bowel movement. Stool appearance and weight was
determined for each collected stool fraction. Faecal samples were taken until at least 15:00 pm on Day 4
and an attempt was made to collect a final faecal sample prior to discharge from the phase I unit.

[00309]    The subjects were randomised into four groups (1:1:1:1), and given solution A3 in Table 6a as
the evening dose, followed by one of solutions B1, B4, B5 and B6 as the morning dose. Solutions B1, B4
and B5 are solutions of the invention. Solution B6 is a reference solution.
[00310]    In addition to the investigation formulations intake, the subjects were instructed to take further
clear liquid (water). In each case, they were instructed to take 1750 mL of further clear liquid (875 mL
after the evening dose, and 875 mL after the morning dose).
[00311]    Efficacy:
[00312]    The primary variable in the clinical study was the stool weight output generated by the
investigational solutions (combined evening and morning dosing on Day 1 and Day 2) over 24 hours from
the start of the intake of the evening solution. The reference value of the study was set to a stool weight
of approximately 2500g or greater, which it is desired to be reached in order to demonstrate positive
pharmacodynamic effects indicating a potential as a colon cleansing agent.
[00313]    In addition to the primary trial variable mentioned above, stool output was separately measured
and recorded for a) the time between when the subject starts to take the evening dose (17:00 to 18:00 on
Day 1) and the time the subject starts to take the morning dose (7am to 8am on Day 2); and b) the time
the subject starts to take the morning dose (7am to 8am on Day 2) and midnight on Day 2.

[00318]     The "pm stool median" is the median stool output between the time the subject starts to take the
evening dose (17:00 to 18:00 on Day 1) and the time the subject starts to take the morning dose (7 amto
8am on Day 2). The "am stool median" is the median stool output between the time the subject starts to
take the morning dose (7am to 8am on Day 2) and midnight on Day 2.            The "pm stool mean" and "am
stool mean" entries are the corresponding mean values.
[00319]     It is generally considered that a total stool output of approximately 2500g is required in order to
achieve acceptable bowel cleansing. A stool output of approximately 2500g or greater than that is thus
indicative that a solution has good potential for use as a bowel cleansing solution. Both A2 + B3 and A3
+ B3 resulted in a median stool weight of significantly greater than 2500g. The commercial
MOVIPREP solution also achieved a median stool output of in excess of 2500g, as was to be expected.
The stool output was highest for A3 + B3. Solution B3 was therefore selected to be the morning solution
for Part 2 of the study. The observed stool output was achieved for MOVIPREP with the ingestion of 2
litres of investigational solution. For the A2 + B3 and A3 + B3 solutions, the mean stool weights were
achieved using a total investigational solution volume of 1250ml.

                                                      59
[00320]    Solutions A2 and A3 were effective in contributing to an effective cleansing with any of the
solutions with which they were used. It is seen from the "am stool median" and "pm stool median"
figures that the stool output immediately after the ingestion of the A2 and A3 solutions was less copious
than after the B solutions. The A2 and A3 solutions contributed to the effective bowel cleansing. Given
that the subject will often wish to sleep between taking the first bowel cleansing solution and the second
solution, it may be advantageous for the first cleansing solution to result in a slightly lower stool output
than the second cleansing solution.

[00323] A3+B1 and A3+B4 resulted in a 24 hour median stool output weight of greater than 2500g. For
the combination A3+B5, the median stool output was just under 2500g, but the mean stool output was
over 2500g. Thus, all of the solution combinations of the invention (A3+B1, A3+B4 and A3+B5)
resulted in a 24 hour mean or median stool output weight of greater than 2500g.
[00324] Considering the data from tables 7a, 7b, 8a and 8b together, Bi, B3, B4 and B5 solutions have
been shown to be effective bowel cleansing solutions when used in combination with any other solution
with which they were used. The particularly copious stool output seen in the "am stool mean" figures
shows that the solutions are especially effective.
[00325] In the case of A3+B1, the median stool weight was significantly greater than 2500g. It is again
noteworthy that the mean stool weights were achieved using a total investigational solution volume of
only 1250ml.
[00326] Solution A3 in combination with reference solution B6 resulted in stool output that was not
statistically significantly different from 2500g.

the words "comprise" and "include" and variations such as "comprising" and "including" will be
understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers, but not the exclusion of any
other integer or group of integers.
