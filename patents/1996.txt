DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS
[0017]     Some example embodiments now will be described more fully hereinafter with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all example embodiments
are shown. Indeed, the examples described and pictured herein should not be construed as
being limiting as to the scope, applicability, or configuration of the present disclosure.
Rather, these example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy
applicable legal requirements. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.
As used herein the term "or" is used as the logical or, where any one or more of the
operands being true results in the statement being true.
[0018]     According to various example embodiments, a mobile security tag interface device
100 is provided. The device 100 is configured to interface with a variety of retail product
security tags to perform detachment of reusable tags and deactivation of disposable tags. A
security tag is a device that is affixed to or disposed within a retail product that causes an
alarm to sound if the product, with the active security tag, is brought with the range of radio
frequency security pedestals located at, for an example, an exit of a retail store. In this
regard, a security tag may include an LC circuit (inductor and capacitor circuit) that is
configured to resonate at a target frequency, e.g., 8.2 MHz, in response to an
electromagnetic field, for example, at the same frequency generated by the security
pedestals. The alarm at the pedestals sounds in order to indicate that a potential theft may
be occurring because a product with an active security tag is near the exit. If a product is
properly purchased, store personnel may either detach and remove a security tag, or
deactivate a security tag, so that the paying customer may leave the retail store with the
product without sounding the alarm.
[0019]     Accordingly, security tags may be either reusable or disposable. Examples of
reusable tags include hard tags and tags that include on-tag tamper alarming capabilities,
such as tag that have locking cables. Reusable tags are detached from a product by retail
store personnel and stay in the retail store for reuse on other products. During the
purchasing transaction the reusable tag may be detached from the product and the product
may free leave the store with the customer. Disposable tags can be labels that may be
located internal to sealed packaging of a product or adhered to an external surface of the
product or product packaging. Disposable tags may be constructed such that the tags may
be subjected to a high intensity electromagnetic field at a target frequency to induce high
current in the tag that destroys the tags ability to transmit a responsive radio frequency

                                                 -4
signal. The disposable tags may include an electrically weakened point in the circuit that
fails in the presence of a sufficiently strong field at a given frequency. As such, the
disposable tag is deactivated and the purchased product may leave the retail store without
causing the alarm at the pedestals to sound.
[0020]      The mobile security tag interface device 100 may therefore be used on the sales
floor to assist customers with removal or deactivation of a security tags. In this regard, in
retail environments where mobile point-of-sale (POS) approaches are used and store
personnel have the ability to complete a transaction via, for example, a handheld POS, the
device 100 offers the ability for store personnel to complete a sales transaction, in its entirety
at the mobile location. As such, after the financial portion of the mobile POS transaction is
complete, the store personnel may use the device 100 to remove or deactivate any security
tags associated with the purchased products, so that the customer may leave the store
directly without having to stop in another location to address the security tags. Being able to
address all of the customer's sales needs at one mobile location contributes to a convenient
and therefore positive customer experience.
[0021]      As such, with reference to FIGs. 1 through 4, the mobile security tag interface
device 100 may be configured to perform both detachment of reusable tags and deactivation
of disposable tags. In this regard, the mobile security tag interface device 100 may have a
housing 110 (e.g., formed of injection molded plastic) that is generally six-sided rectangular
or cuboid-shaped. The housing 110 may include a top surface 101, a bottom surface 102, a
front surface 103, a rear surface 104, a first side surface 105, and a second side surface
106.
[0022]      On the top surface 101, the device 100 may include a deactivation area 150 and a
first detacher 170. The deactivation area 150 may be disposed rearward of the first detacher
170. The deactivation area 150 may be the portion of the device 100 that can be aligned
with a disposable tag to deactivate the disposable tag. As shown in FIG. 2, the
electromagnetic deactivation field 151 that is generated by the tag deactivator 155 via an
antenna 220 disposed internal to the housing 110 may emanate away from the device 100 at
the deactivation area 150. As such, the device 100 may include internal shielding and the
like to cause the electromagnetic deactivation field 151 to emanate from the deactivation
area 150 on the top surface 101 of the device 100.

                                                -5
[0023]     The first detacher 170 may be generally circular in shape a may include one or
more magnets that generate a magnetic field for interacting with a reusable tag to unlock the
tag for removal from the product. As shown in FIG. 5, the first detacher 170 may include a
base magnet 172 and a ring magnet 173 disposed above the base magnet 172. The
magnetic fields of the base magnet 172 and the ring magnet 173 may combine to generate a
stronger field strength at the detacher target 171. According to some example
embodiments, the first detacher 170 may be a configured with an appropriate magnetic field
to unlock certain types of reusable tags including, for example, tags with standard lock
mechanisms, super lock mechanisms, or the like.
[0024]     A sound grill 156 and fasteners 111 may be disposed on the bottom surface 102.
The sound grill 156 may be aligned with an internal audio emitter 230 that operates to make
an audible sound in association with the operation of the tag deactivator 155 as further
described below. The fasteners 111 may operate to secure a top half and a bottom half of
the housing together.
[0025]     The front surface 103 of the device 100 may include a second detacher 190. The
second detacher 190 may also be magnetic. However, the magnets of the second detacher
190 may be assembled such that a specific magnetic field pattern is emitted that is designed
to unlock certain other types of reusable security tags. A design of the magnet set of the
second detacher 190 may be as shown in FIG. 6. In this regard, the magnet set may include
four magnets, i.e., magnet 191, magnet 192, magnet 193, and magnet 194. According to
some example embodiments, the magnet set may be formed of two magnet couples with
magnets 191 and 192 forming a first couple and magnets 193 and 194 forming a second
couple. Within each couple, the polarity of the magnets may be oppositely oriented such
that, for example, a north polarity of one magnet in the couple is adjacent the south polarity
of the other magnet in the couple.
[0026]     To assist in properly orienting the reusable tag with the magnetic field of the
second detacher 190, a pair of guide protrusions 195 may be disposed on the front surface
102 of the device 100. The guide protrusions 195 may be positioned below each respective
magnet couple. The guide protrusions 195 may also be aligned centrally to each respective
magnet couple. To detach a reusable tag via the second detacher 190, a user may align the
guide protrusions 195 with respective recesses on the reusable tag. By doing so, the
magnetic field may be properly aligned with a locking mechanism of the tag to permit the tag
to be unlocked any removed from a product. Accordingly, the second detacher 190 may be

                                                -6
configured to unlock reusable tags of a certain type, including, for example, reusable tags
offered by Checkpoint Systems, Inc. under the AlphaTM line of products.
[0027]      On a back surface 104, the device 100 may include a charging interface 160 and a
locking recess 165. The charging interface may be configured to receive a plug to
electrically connect the device 100 to a battery charger, e.g., battery charger 290. The
locking recess 165 may be a recessed area that is configured to receive a locking member
of a locking cradle to secure the device 100 into the locking cradle as further described
below.
[0028]      To support the operation of the tag deactivator 155, the first side surface 105 (e.g.,
a right side) of the device 100 may include a power switch 130. The power switch 130 may
be configured to disconnect some or all of the electrical load on a battery disposed within the
housing 110. As such, as further described below, the power switch 130 may therefore
operate to assist with extending the life of the battery by disconnecting the battery when the
device 100 and the tag deactivator 155 are not in use. The power switch 130 may be a
toggle switch that maintains a position and associated state when actuated.
[0029]      Further, on a second side surface 106 (e.g., a left side) of the device 100, a
deactivator switch 140 may be disposed. The deactivator switch 140 may be configured to,
upon actuation, cause the tag deactivator 155 to energize an antenna to emit a radio
frequency signal and monitor for a return signal from a tag, as further described below.
According to some example embodiments, the deactivator switch 140 may be a push button
switch that is spring loaded and is actuated when depressed by a user and returns to an
original position and state when the user releases pressure on the deactivator switch 140.
[0030]      Additionally, the housing 110 of the device 100 may include grips 180 on each of
the first side surface 105 and the second side surface 106. The grips 180 may be a series of
partially circular indentations that provide an ergonomic grasping position for a user's hand
on the housing 110. The grips 180 may be disposed on a front end of the first side surface
105 and the second side surface 106 to facilitate use of the grips 180 in conjunction with, for
example, the second detacher 190 in a forward direction and the tag deactivator 155 in the
rearward direction.
[0031]      FIG. 7 provides a functional block diagram of example circuitry implemented within
the housing 110 of the device 100. In this regard, the device 100 may include a battery 200,

                                                -7
the power switch 130, processing circuitry 250, a deactivator switch 140, an antenna 220,
and an audio emitter 230.
[0032]     The battery 200 may be any type of battery including, for example, a rechargeable
battery. In this regard, lithium-ion, nickel-cadmium, or other battery chemistries may be
used. The battery 200 may be electrically connected with the power switch 130 to permit the
power switch 130 to control connectivity to the battery 130. Additionally, the battery 200 may
be connectable with a battery charger 290, for example, via the charging interface 160. In
this regard, the battery charger 290 may supply the battery 200 with, for example, direct
current to charge the battery 200 when the device 100 is not in use or is used in a stationary
fashion. The battery charger 290 may be connectable to a power source 295 such as, for
example, mains alternating current power to the retail store.
[0033]     When the power switch 130 is closed and power can flow from the battery 200,
and the processing circuitry 250 may be powered and operate as configured. The
processing circuitry 250 may include one or more active and passive electronic components
configured to cause the device 100 to perform various functionalities with respect to tag
deactivation. The components of the processing circuitry 250 may include a processor that
may be configured via firmware or hardware configured as, for example, and application
specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or the like.
Further, the processing circuitry 250 may include a memory configured to store instructions
for execution by the processor to perform the functionalities described herein. In this regard,
the processing circuitry 250 may be configured to perform modular functionalities in the form
of a switch interface 251, a tag detection controller 252, a deactivation signal generator 253,
and an audio controller 254. Additionally, the battery 200, the power switch 130, the
processing circuitry 250, the deactivator switch 140, the antenna 220, and the audio emitter
230 may collectively be referred to as the tag deactivator 155.
[0034]     In this regard, the switch interface 251 may be electrically connected to the
deactivator switch 140. The switch interface 251 may be configured to monitor a state of the
deactivator switch 140 to determine if a user has actuated the deactivator switch 140. In this
regard, the state of the deactivator switch 140 may be monitored regularly at a given
frequency. The deactivation signal generator 253 may be configured to generate an
electrical signal to be output to the antenna 220 for emission as a radio frequency signal for
energizing a tag. The antenna 220 may be a loop antenna that is configured to
electromagnetically couple to a resonant circuit of a disposable tag. The tag detection

                                               -8
controller 252 may be configured to monitor the antenna 220 or another antenna to
determine if a tag has provided a radio frequency signal in response to a deactivation signal
emitted by the antenna 220. The audio controller 254 may be configured to electrically drive
the audio emitter 230 to generate an audible sound. In this regard, the audio emitter 230
may be a sounder (e.g., a piezo sounder), a speaker, or the like.
[0035]     The following describes a scenario where these components and modules are
operating collectively. In this regard, the deactivator switch 140 may be actuated by a user
desiring to deactivate a disposable tag. The switch interface 251 of the processing circuitry
250 may detect the actuation of the deactivator switch 140, thereby triggering the
deactivation signal generator 253 to transmit a deactivation signal to antenna 220 for
wireless transmission to a tag. Upon receipt of the deactivation signal, the tag may be
energized and may provide a responsive signal. Upon receipt of the tag's responsive signal
via the antenna 220 and the tag detection controller 252, the audio controller 254 may be
responsively triggered to cause the audio emitter 230 generate an audible sound. The
audible sound may indicate that a tag has been detected due to receipt of the responsive
signal and the tag is currently being deactivated. With the deactivator switch 140 still
actuated, the processing circuitry 250 may be continue to cycle between transmitting the
deactivation signal, detecting a return signal, and generating the audible sound, until the
deactivation signal has caused the tag to fail. As such, when the tag fails, the audible sound
will be discontinued since no return signal will be received, thereby indicating that the
disposable tag has been deactivated, and the purchased product may leave the retail store
without sounding an alarm.
[0036]     With reference to FIG. 8, a stationary locking cradle 300 for use with the device
100 is shown. The locking cradle 300 may be configured to be affixed to a stationary
surface and the device 100 may be locked into the locking cradle 300. As such, the locking
cradle 300 may provide for lockably mounting the device 100 to, for example, a counter at a
stationary point of sale location or in a secure area when the device 100 is not in use by
store personnel.
[0037]     The locking cradle 300 may include a device cavity 310 for receiving the device
100. On one end of the cavity 310, the locking cradle 300 may include a lip 315 that forms a
recess under which one end of the device 100 may be received. At an opposite end of the
cavity 310, a locking member 320 may be provided. The locking member 320 may be
configured to engage the locking recess 165 of the device 100 to secure the device 100 in

                                               -9
the cavity 310 in collaboration with the lip 315. The locking member 320 may move between
an extended, locked position and a retracted, unlocked position. The movement of the
locking member 320 may be controlled, mechanically, by a lock 330. Lock 330 may be
configured to receive a key, e.g., a barrel key, and the key may be turned to cause the
locking member 320 to move between the locked and unlocked positions.
[0038]    The locking cradle 300 may also include side walls 350. The side walls 350 may
extend along and be adjacent to the first side surface 105 and second side surface 106 of
the device 100. In this regard, the side walls 350 may not extend to cover the power switch
130 and the deactivator switch 140, and therefore the power switch 130 and the deactivator
switch 140 may still be accessible when the device 100 is installed in the locking cradle 300.
The locking cradle locking 300 may also include an mounting aperture 340 that may be used
to secure the locking cradle 300 to a stationary surface via a fastener, e.g., a screw.
[0039]     FIG. 9 shows the device 100 installed and locked into the locking cradle 300. As
shown, the power switch 130 and the deactivator switch 140 are still accessible thereby
permitting the tag deactivator 155 to be used while the device 100 is locked in the locking
cradle 300. Further, since the top surface 101 is accessible, tags can be brought into the
deactivation area 150 for deactivation. Additionally, the first detacher 170 is accessible due
to being located on the top surface 101. The second detacher 190, however, may not be
accessible because the front surface 103 may be disposed in the recess formed by the lip
315.
[0040]    Accordingly, a mobile security tag interface device 100 is provided that may
comprise a housing 110 having a top surface 101 and a front surface 103. The device 100
may further include a first detacher 170. The first detacher 170 may be magnetic and may
be disposed on the top surface 101. The device 100 may also include a tag deactivator 155
configured to generate an electromagnetic deactivation field 151 to deactivate a radio
frequency tag responsive to an actuation of a deactivator switch 140. In this regard, the
electromagnetic deactivation field 151 may be directed to emanate from the top surface 101.
The device 100 may also include a second detacher 190. The second detacher 190 may be
magnetic and may be disposed on the front surface 103. The second detacher 190 may
comprise at least one a guide protrusion 195.
[0041]    According to some example embodiments, the device 100 may further comprise
an antenna 220 and processing circuitry 250 configured to cause the antenna to generate

                                              - 10
the electromagnetic deactivation field 151 in response to actuating the deactivator switch
140. According to some example embodiments, the device 100 may further comprise an
audio emitter 230. In this regard, the processing circuitry 250 may be further configured to
cause the audio emitter 230 to output an audible sound in response to receipt of a return
radio frequency signal from the radio frequency tag. According to some example
embodiments, device 100 may further comprise a rechargeable battery 200 configured to
power the tag deactivator 155. According to some example embodiments, the device 100
may further comprise a locking recess 165 configured to engage with a locking member 320
of a locking cradle 300 to lock the mobile security tag interface device 100 into the locking
cradle 300. In this regard, the locking cradle 300 may be configured to be affixed to a
stationary object.
