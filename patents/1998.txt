           IN-LINE ARTICLES AND METHODS OF MANUFACTURE AND USE
                                           BACKGROUND
   [0001]         The present disclosure is directed to articles for banding and tagging
 5 merchandise, and more particularly to tie articles bearing printed information formed with
   retention wires for banding merchandise.
   [0002]         Merchandise of many different types is banded in one way or another for
   packaging or preparing the merchandise for movement in channels toward the ultimate
   presentation and marketing to the consumer. For example, a twist tie may be placed about
10 the mouth of a bag or about a box of merchandise or about multiple boxes. The twist tie
   may also be placed directly about the merchandise itself, such as about a grouping of
   agricultural produce or about a single item of merchandise (e.g., a rolled or folded
   newspaper).
   [0003]         Labeling or marking of merchandise with printed matter is also often
15 desirable to provide information to various entities in the production and marketing
   channels as well as to the ultimate consumer. The printed matter may provide information
   regarding merchandise identification and price and may take the form of, for example,
   machine readable or scannable material (such as codes comprised of bars or characters) and
   human readable material (such as characters and graphical or pictorial matter).

                                             SUMMARY
   [0004]         An aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a tie article that includes an
   attachment portion and a bib portion.         The attachment portion includes a connection
   segment, at least one arm segment extending from the connection segment, and at least one
25 closure device (e.g., a retention wire, tin tie, clip tie, and the like) extending along the
   connection segment and the arm segment(s). The bib portion extends from the connection
   segment of the attachment portion, where the attachment portion and the bib portion are
   integrally fabricated from a printed sheet having a first surface and a polymeric film
   adhered to the first surface of the printed sheet such that the closure device(s)(s) is disposed
30 between the first surface of the printed sheet and the polymeric film at the attachment
   portion.
   [0005]         Another aspect of the present disclosure is directed to an in-line process for
   manufacturing tie articles. The in-line processes includes feeding a printed sheet of a paper
                                                   1

   based material to a nip roller, where the printed sheet comprises printed information,
   feeding a plurality of closure devices (e.g., retention wires, tin ties, clip ties, and the like) to
   the nip roller with the fed printed sheet, and feeding an extruded polymeric material to the
   nip roller with the fed printed sheet and the fed closure devices. The process also includes
 5 forming a tie article sheet from the fed printed sheet, the fed closure devices, and the fed
   polymeric material such that the closure devices are encased between the printed sheet and
   the polymeric material. The process also includes cutting the tie article sheet into a plurality
   of tie articles having attachment portions with the closure devices and bib portions
   extending from the attachment portions and having the printed information, where at least a
10 portion of the plurality of tie articles remain at least partially connected to each other at the
   cut tie article sheet.
   [0006]           Another aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a method for labeling
   an item. The method includes providing a tie article having an attachment portion and a bib
   portion extending from the attachment portion and having printed information.                   The
15 attachment portion and the bib portion are integrally connected with a printed sheet, where
   the attachment portion also includes a polymeric film adhered to the printed sheet with a
   closure device (e.g., a retention wire, tin tie, clip tie, and the like) encased therebetween,
   and where the attachment portion further includes at least one arm segment. The method
   also includes folding the arm segment(s) of the attachment portion around at least a portion
20 of the item to secure the item against the attachment portion, and such that the bib portion
   extends from the secured attachment portion to display the printed information.

   [0029]           While the above-identified figures set forth one or more embodiments of the
   disclosed subject matter, other embodiments are also contemplated, as noted in the
   disclosure. In all cases, this disclosure presents the disclosed subject matter by way of
10 representation and not limitation. It should be understood that numerous other modifications
   and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art which fall within the scope and
   spirit of the principles of this disclosure.
                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
15 [0030]           The present disclosure is directed to tie articles, such as bib ties and flag ties,
   that may be manufactured in a continuous, in-line process, which reduces manufacturing
   costs and time, and which desirably produces tie articles with good durability. As discussed
   below, the tie article of the present disclosure includes a bib portion and a tie or attachment
   portion, and may be used in a variety of industrial, commercial, and residential applications.
20 For instance, the tie or attachment portion may be used to attach the tie article to an item, to
   bundle items together (e.g., agricultural produce, closable packages, cables, writing utensils,
   eating utensils, and the like), and/or to hold packages or articles closed (e.g., hold bread
   bags closed or hold rolled papers closed).
   [0031]           Once the tie or attachment portion is attached to the item, the bib portion
25 may then prominently display information, such as textual, graphical, colored, machine
   readable information (e.g., bar codes, quick response codes, RFID tags), internet addresses,
   about the attached or bundled items. For example, FIG. 1 illustrates tie article 10 in use
   with bundled cables 12, where tie article 10 includes tie portion 14 and bib portion 16. As
   shown, tie portion 14 is secured around cables 12 to bundle them together, and to secure tie
30 article 10 to them. While illustrated in use with cables 12, tie article 10 may alternatively
   be used to bundle a variety of different items, as mentioned above.
   [0032]           When attached to cables 12, bib portion 16 is suspended from tie portion 14,
   and may include readable or otherwise viewable information about cables 12, such as the
                                                   4

   produce type, UPC codes, brand information, storage and use instructions, producer
   information, and the like.       Thus, tie article 10 provides a convenient and effective
   mechanism for bundling cables 12 or other items together, while also prominently
   displaying information about cables 12 or the other items. Furthermore, as discussed below,
 5 tie portion 14 and bib portion 16 may be integrally formed together in a continuous, in-line
   manufacturing process, which preferably produces multiple tie articles 10 in sheet and/or
   roll form.
   [0033]          FIGS. 2-4 illustrate a first example embodiment for tie article 10. As shown
   in FIG. 2, prior to being secured to an item (e.g., cables 12), tie portion 14 may be provided
10 in a flat, non-bent state (as shown) or in a partially-bent state (e.g., if provided in a roll
   form).    As further shown, tie portion 14 integrally extends into bib portion 16, where tie
   portion 14 and bib portion 16 structurally include printed sheet 18, front film 20, and
   retention wire 22 (or other closure device, such as a tin tie, clip tie, and the like). Printed
   sheet 18 and front film 20 are secured together at both tie portion 14 and bib portion 16,
15 where retention wire 22 is secured therebetween along tie portion 14. As such, tie portion
    14 may function as a twist tie or other attachment mechanism to secure tie article 10 to
   items, to bundle the items together, and/or to hold packages or other articles closed.
   [0034]          Printed sheet 18 is desirably produced from a printable material, such as one
   or more paper-based materials and/or polymeric materials to present information (e.g.,
20 textual, graphical, colored, and/or machine readable information).         As discussed below,
   when manufacturing tie article 10, printed sheet 18 is desirably provided as a pre-formed
   and pre-printed sheet that may be fed into a continuous, in-line process.
   [0035]          Front film 20 is desirably produced from a clear polymeric material that
   exhibits good interlayer bonding to printed sheet 18. This allows information presented on
25 a front surface 24 of printed sheet 18, such as indicia 26, to be visible through front film 20.
   The good interlayer bonding also secures retention wire 22 between printed sheet 18 and
   front film 20 at tie portion 14.
   [0036]          The polymeric material of front film 20 also desirably provides durability to
   tie article 10 and protects printed sheet 18. For example, in embodiments in which printed
30 sheet 18 is produced from printable paper, front film 20 may structurally reinforce the paper
   at tie portion 14 and bib portion 16, thereby reducing the risk of tearing tie article 10 during
   use.    Examples of suitable polymeric materials for front film 20 include extrudable
                                                   5

   polymeric materials, such as polyolefins (e.g., low-density polyethylene, high-density
   polyethylene, and combinations thereof).
   [0037]          Retention wire 22 is a metallic or polymeric wire that desirably provides
   good dead-fold properties, as well as good break resistance.            For example, in one
 5 embodiment, retention wire 22 is a metallic-wire core of a twist tie (e.g., a steel wire).
   However, metal-wire twist ties may be undesirable for use in some applications.            For
   example, when food is commercially packaged for distribution to the public, it is desirable
   for the packaging to allow inspection of packaged food for contamination by foreign
   objects. One common method of inspecting food products involves the use of metal
10 detectors to confirm that no metal scrap or shards have inadvertently been incorporated in
   the food product during production or packaging of the food product.
   [0038]          Tie articles with metal retention wires, when attached to food articles,
   preclude such use of a metal detector, since each food article that is attached to the tie
   article would typically generate a response by the metal detector indicating the presence of
15 metal in the food package. Thus, rather than simply detecting the presence of any undesired
   metal in the packaged food, the metal detector would also indicate, for each package, the
   presence of the metal wire retention wire on the tie article.
   [0039]          Accordingly, in other embodiments, retention wire 22 is a polymeric wire,
   such as a single component wire or a multiple component wire.              Suitable polymeric
20 materials for retention wire 18 include polyethylenes (e.g., high-density polyethylenes), and
   those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,372,068, 6,673,413 and 7,011,879. In embodiments in
   which the polymer material is a high-density polyethylene, the high-density polyethylene
   desirably has a weight-average molecular weight ranging from about 130,000 to about
    150,000. The high density polyethylene also desirably has a density of at least about 0.94
25 grams/cubic-centimeter, as measured pursuant to ASTM D792-08.
   [0040]          In some embodiments, the material of retention wire 22 may also include
   additional additives, such as colorants, fillers, dead-fold modifiers, biodegradable additives
   (e.g., oxo-biodegradable    additives), toughness modifiers, bond promoters, ultraviolet
   stabilizers, and the like. In these embodiments, examples of suitable concentrations of the
30 additives in the material range from about 0.01% by weight to about 10% by weight, based
   on an entire weight of the material.     In one embodiment, suitable concentrations of the
   additives in the material range from about 0.05% by weight to about 5% by weight, based
                                                   6

   on an entire weight of the material. The polymeric materials discussed above accordingly
   constitute the remainder of the material for retention wire 22.
   [0041]          While illustrated with a single retention wire 22, in other embodiments, tie
   portion 12 may include other polymeric and/or metallic closure devices, such as tin ties, clip
 5 ties, and the like. In these embodiments, the closure device also desirably provides good
   dead-fold properties, as well as good break resistance.
   [0042]          At tie portion 14, printed sheet 18, front film 20, and retention wire 22 define
   a pair of arm segments 28 extending in opposing lateral directions from connection or mid
   segment 30. Arm segments 28 may function as twist-tie arms, which may be manipulated
10 (e.g., bent and twisted) to secure tie article 10 to items. Printed sheet 18 and front film 20
   extend into bib portion 16 at mid-segment 30, allowing bib portion 16 to be suspended from
   tie portion 14 when tie portion 14 is attached or bundled to items to display indicia 26.
   [0043]          Examples of suitable thicknesses for tie portion 14 (outside of the location of
   retention wire 22) and for bib portion 16 range from about 0.003 inches to about 0.01
15 inches, where the relative thicknesses of printed sheet 18 and front film 20 may vary
   depending on the particular materials used for each. For example, in embodiments in which
   printed sheet 18 is produced from a stiffer and stronger card material, front film 20 may be
   thinner since front printed sheet 18 requires less structural reinforcement.       However, in
   other embodiments in which printed sheet 18 is produced from a printable thinner and
20 weaker material (e.g., paper), front film 20 is desirably thicker to structurally reinforce
   printed sheet 18.
   [0044]          At the location of retention wire 22, the thickness of tie portion 14 is
   increased to account for the dimensions of retention wire 22. For example, for a retention
   wire 22 having a diameter or other cross-sectional thickness of about 0.017 inches,
25 examples of suitable thicknesses for tie portion 14 at the location of retention wire 22 range
   from about 0.02 inches to about 0.03 inches.
   [0045]          As shown in FIG. 3, printed sheet 18 also includes rear surface 32, which
   may also include printed information, such as bar code 34 or other textual, graphical,
   colored, machine readable information, and/or internet addresses. Because front film 20 is
30 disposed over front surface 24 of printed sheet 18, in the shown embodiment, rear surface
   32 of printed sheet 18 may be directly exposed for displaying bar code 34 or other
   information.
                                                   7

   [0046]          FIG. 4 further illustrates the relative arrangements of printed sheet 18, front
   film 20, and retention wire 22. As can be seen, front surface 24 of printed sheet 18 is
   disposed below front film 20 when printed sheet 18 and front film 20 are bonded together,
   allowing indicia 26 to be visible through the clear polymeric material of front film 20. In
 5 alternative embodiments, printed sheet 18 may function as the front side of tie article 10,
   and film 20 may function as the rear side of tie article 10 (i.e., film 20 is bonded to rear
   surface 32 of sheet 18).      This may depend on which side of tie article 10 the user or
   manufacturer intends to display when attached to one or more items.
   [0047]          As further shown, retention wire 22 (or other closure device) may be free of
10 any additional paper wings that are otherwise associated with twist ties. This is because
   printed sheet 18 and front film 20 themselves function as the twist tie wings at tie portion
    14. This precludes the need for an additional manufacturing step to produce a twist tie prior
   to assembling the twist tie with a bib portion in a fold-over manner. Instead, tie article 10
   may be manufactured with only the components for printed sheet 18, front film 20, and
15 retention wire 22, if desired, thereby reducing material costs and the number of
   manufacturing steps.
   [0048]          FIG. 5 is a schematic illustration of an example process system 36 for
   manufacturing multiple tie articles 10 in a sheet or roll form using a continuous, in-line
   process. As shown, process system 36 includes extruded polymer inlet line 38, wire inlet
20 line 40, and sheet inlet line 42. Extruded polymer inlet line 38 is an extrusion line (e.g., a
   twin-screw extruder) configured to melt and extrude the polymeric material for front film
   20. Wire inlet line 40 is configured to relay one or more continuous strands of retention
   wire 22 (or other closure device) from supply sources (e.g., spools of retention wires 22 or
   manufacturing lines for retention wires 22). Finally, sheet inlet line 42 is configured to
25 relay pre-printed sheets for printed sheet 18.
   [0049]          Polymer inlet line 38, wire inlet line 40, and sheet inlet line 42 desirably
   converge at nip rollers 44, which may compress and cool the received materials to produce
   a continuous web 46 of the laminated layers. Web 46 moves in the direction of arrow 48
   and is cut at die cutter 50 into the multiple, separable tie articles 10. For example, die cutter
30 50 may partially cut and/or perforate web 46, allowing web 46 to maintain a continuous
   sheet of multiple, separable tie articles 10 that can exit process system 36 via exit line 52.
   Resulting scrap pieces may drop out of process system 36 via scrap line 54, where the scrap
   pieces may then be collected and recycled. The resulting continuous sheet of tie articles 10
                                                    8

   from exit line 52 may then be stacked, folded, rolled into a roll form, or otherwise made
   available for subsequent consumer use.
   [0050]          In an alternative embodiment, the pre-printed sheet entering via sheet inlet
   line 42 may be pre-cut (e.g., die cut) prior to reaching nip rollers 44. In this embodiment,
 5 the lamination of the polymer to form front film 20 may form a window over the pre-cut
   sheet, which can be subsequently separated (or cut, if desired).
   [0051]          FIG. 6 illustrates an example continuous sheet 56 of multiple tie articles 10
   after exiting process system 36 via exit line 52. As shown, continuous sheet 56 may include
   multiple tie articles 10 arranged in a staggered back-to-back arrangement to maximize the
10 number of tie articles 10 per square area of sheet 56. In particular, this staggered back-to
   back arrangement provides repeating patterns of ten tie articles 10, with two staggered sets
   of five back-to-back tie articles 10.
   [0052]          To maintain the sheet-like character of sheet 56, the individual tie articles 10
   desirably remain at least partially connected to each other.            For example, in some
15 embodiments, the tie articles 10 may be cut around bib portions 16, where the segments of
   sheet 56 between each pair of bib portions 16 (referred to as regions 58) may be fully cut
   out to provide the scrap at scrap line 54 (shown above in FIG. 5). Alternatively, regions 58
   may remain connected to sheet 56 and partially separated from the bib portions 16 via
   perforated lines, allowing regions 58 to be readily separated by consumers when needed.
20 [0053]          Furthermore, the ends of the retention wires 22 (or other closure devices) are
   desirably fully cut to assist in the ease of separating the individual tie articles 10. A variety
   of different cut patterns may be used to retain sheet 56 in a sheet-like form, while also
   allowing each individual tie article 10 to be separated without requiring undue force or
   separate cutting utensils.    As mentioned above, upon exiting process system 36, sheet 56
25 may be stacked, folded, rolled into a roll form, or otherwise made available for transporting,
   storing, and using tie articles 10.
   [0054]          Accordingly, during subsequent consumer use, the consumer may obtain a
   sheet or roll of sheet 56, separate the desired number of tie articles 10 (manually or with an
   automated system), and attach them to one or more items with tie portions 14 (again,
30 manually or with an automated system). For example, tie portion 14 of a tie article 10 may
   be attached to a single item, and the corresponding bib portion 14 may then display
   information for the given item. Alternatively, tie portion 14 may be bound around multiple
   items to bundle the items together. In this situation, the corresponding bib portion 14 may
                                                    9

   also display information for the given bundled items. Furthermore, tie portion 14 may be
   used hold a package closed, such as bread bag twist tie, where the corresponding bib portion
   14 may display information for the given package or goods within the package.
   Additionally, tie portion 14 may be used hold an article closed, such as rolled paper (e.g., a
 5 rolled map), where the corresponding bib portion 14 may display information for the given
   article.
   [0055]          FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate a first alternative embodiment to tie article 10,
   referred to as tie article 60. Tie article 60 is similar to tie article 10, but further includes a
   rear film 62 bonded to rear surface 32 of printed sheet 18. Suitable materials for rear film
10 62 include those discussed above for front film 20. As such, rear film 62 is also desirably
   clear, allowing information on rear surface 32, such as bar code 34 (shown in FIG. 8), to be
   visible through rear film 62. Rear film 62 may be used to further reinforce printed sheet 18,
   where front film 20 and rear film 62 may collectively encase printed sheet 18, thereby
   protecting printed sheet 18 from adverse environmental conditions (e.g., moisture).
15 [0056]          Multiple tie articles 60 may also be manufactured in sheet form as discussed
   above for tie articles 10 and sheet 56 (shown above in FIG. 6). In particular, process system
   36 (shown above in FIG. 5) may be modified to include a second extruded polymer inlet
   line, similar to inlet line 38, on the opposing side of sheet inlet line 42 from wire inlet line
   40. This allows process system 36 to produce sheets and/or rolls of multiple tie articles 60
20 in a similar manner to that as discussed above for the sheets and rolls of multiple tie articles
   10.
   [0057]          FIGS. 9-11 illustrate another alternative embodiment to tie articles 10 and
   60, referred to as tie article 64. As shown in this embodiment, front film 20 of tie article 64
   only extends over printed sheet 18 at tie portion 14.         Accordingly, front surface 24 of
25 printed sheet 18 at bib portion 16 may be exposed without any film overcoat.                  This
   embodiment is suitable, for example, when printed sheet 18 is produced from a durable
   paper-based material that does not otherwise require structural reinforcement. Nonetheless,
   laminating front film 20 over printed sheet 18 at tie portion 14 retains retention wire 22 (or
   other closure device) therebetween, allowing tie article 64 to also be manufactured in a
30 continuous, in-line process as discussed above for tie articles 10 and sheet 56 (shown above
   in FIG. 6).    However, in this embodiment, sheet 18 may be post-printed (e.g., after nip
   rollers 44 of process system 36), if desired.
                                                   10

   [0058]          In alternative embodiments, front film 20 may extend partially into bib
   portion 16 to partially reinforce printed sheet 18. As such, front film 20 may cover any
   desired area of bib portion 16. Moreover, in alternative embodiments, printed sheet 18 may
   function as the front side of tie article 10, and film 20 may function as the rear side of tie
 5 article 10. In other words, film 20 and retention wire 22 (or other closure device) may be
   secured to the rear side of tie article 64, if desired. This may depend on which side of tie
   article 10 the user or manufacturer intends to display when attached to one or more items.
   [0059]          In the above-discussed embodiments of the tie articles of the present
   disclosure (e.g., tie articles 10, 60, and 64), the bib portions 16 each included a substantially
10 rectangular geometry.       However, the tie articles of the present disclosure may have bib
   portions with any desired geometry. For example, as shown in FIG. 12, tie article 66 may
   include a bib portion 16 having a half-circle geometry. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 13,
   tie article 68 may include a bib portion 16 having a trapezoidal geometry.
   [0060]          The particular geometry for bib portion 16 may be generated with die cutter
15 50 of process system 36 (shown above in FIG. 5), where the cutout regions 58 of sheet 56
   (shown in FIG. 6) will have geometries that are reciprocal matches to the geometries of bib
   portions 16. As can be appreciated, the use of cutout regions 58 in this manner allows a
   single process system 36 to be used to manufacture tie articles of the present disclosure
   having a variety of customized bib portions, where the only modification to process system
20 36 is to interchange the cutting die 50.
   [0061]          FIG. 14 illustrates tie article 68, which is another alternative to tie articles 10,
   60, 64, and 66 (or a tie article having any desired geometry for bib portion 16).            In this
   embodiment, tie portion 14 and bib portion 16 are integrally connected at a neck-down
   region 70. The use of neck-down region 70 increases the lengths of arm segments 28, while
25 also allowing bib portion 16 to retain any desired geometry, as discussed above.
   Furthermore, this arrangement reduces the extent that bib portion 16 will bend with tie
   portion 14 when arm segments 28 are bent and tied together around items, allowing bib
   portion 16 to remain in a desired display orientation during use.
   [0062]          FIG. 15 illustrates tie article 72, which is yet another alternative to tie articles
30  10, 60, 64, 66, and 68 (or a tie article having any desired geometry for bib portion 16). In
   this embodiment, bib portion 16 is disposed at a lateral end of tie article 72, providing a
   single arm segment 28. In this manner, tie article 72 may function as a flag tie, where a
   single arm segment 28 is used to attach tie article 72 to items. As can be appreciated, bib
                                                     11

   portion 16 may alternatively be positioned at any centered or off-centered location relative
   to the length of tie portion 14, as individual needs may require.
   [0063]          FIG. 16 illustrates tie article 74, which is yet another alternative to tie articles
    10, 60, 64, 66, 68, and 72 (or a tie article having any desired geometry for bib portion 16).
 5 In this embodiment, attachment portion 14 includes a pair of retention wires 22 and may
   function as a clasp for attaching tie article 74 to an item.        In alternative embodiments,
   attachment portion 14 may include three or more retention wires 22. Tie article 74 is also
   particularly suitable for closure devices such as tin ties and clasp ties, which may replace
   retention wires 22, or be used in addition to retention wires 22.
10 [0064]          FIG. 17 illustrates tie article 74 attached to item 76 (shown with broken
   lines). As shown, retention wires 22 allow arm segments 28 of tie or clasp portion 14 to
   bend around item 76 and fold against each other in a clasped manner.                The dead-fold
   properties of retention wires 22 allow arm segments 28 to remain in their clasped
   arrangement until a user desires to separate them by pulling arm segments 28 apart.               In
15 alternative embodiments, arm segments 28 of attachment portion 14 may be tied together in
   a twist-tie manner, as discussed above for tie articles 10, 60, 64, 66, 68, and 72.
   Accordingly, as discussed above, the terms "tie portion" and "tie article" are not intended to
   limit the use or function of the tie articles of the present disclosure to twist-tie or other tying
   arrangements, and the tie portions may be used to attach the tie articles to items in a variety
20 of manners, such as with the clasp engagement shown in FIG. 17.
   [0065]          The above-discussed embodiments for tie articles 10, 60, 64, 66, 68, 72, and
   74 may be combined with each other as desired to produce tie articles having customized tie
   portions 14 and bib portions 16. For example, the embodiment of tie article 60, having a
   film 20 disposed only over tie portion 14 (and/or over a reduced area of bib portion 16) may
25 be used with a bib portion 16 having a customized geometry (e.g., from tie articles 64 and
   66), a necked-down region (e.g., from tie article 68), an off-centered location relative to the
   length of tie portion 14 (e.g., from tie article 72), and/or a multiple-retention wire/clasp
   arrangement (e.g., tie article 74). Additionally, as discussed above, while described herein
   with the use of retention wires, in other embodiments, the tie portions may include other
30 polymeric and/or metallic closure devices, such as tin ties, clip ties, and the like, which
   desirably provide good dead-fold properties, as well as good break resistance.
   [0066]          Furthermore, multiple tie articles of these combined embodiments may be
   manufactured in sheet form (e.g., sheet 56, shown above in FIG. 6) with a continuous, in
                                                    12

   line process (e.g., with process system 36, shown above in FIG. 5).       During use, each
   individual tie article may be separated from the continuous sheet, and the tie portion 14
   thereof may be used to attach the tie article to an item, to bundle items together (e.g.,
   agricultural produce, closable packages, cables, writing utensils, eating utensils, and the
 5 like), and/or to hold packages and articles closed (e.g., hold bread bags closed or rolled
   paper closed). The corresponding bib portion 16 may then prominently display information,
   such as textual, graphical, colored, machine readable information, and/or internet addresses
   about the attached or bundled items.
   [0067]          Although the present disclosure has been described with reference to several
10 embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form
   and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure.
