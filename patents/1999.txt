 5 Example 1
   Material and Methods
   1. Chemicals and Drugs
   APTM was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at -402C until use.
10 Sulforhodamine B (SRB), trichloroacetic acid (TCA), crystal violet and Hoechst
   33258 were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. McCoy's 5A (Modified) medium, fetal
   bovine serum (FBS), TrypLE TM Express enzyme and penicillin-streptomycin
   (10,000 U/mL) were purchased from GIBCO. Annexin V: FITC Apoptosis
   Detection Kit I was purchased from BD Biosciences and cell cycle detection kit
15 was purchased from Nanjing Key GEN BioTECH. The primary antibodies for
   cleaved nuclear poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (cPARP), p53 and Bax were
   purchased from Cell Signaling. P-actin was purchased from Sigma. Horseradish
   peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson
   ImmunoResearch Inc.
20
   2. Cell Lines and Culture
   Human colon cancer cell line HCT116 (p53+1+) was purchased from ATCC and
   the p53-I- HCT1 16 cell line was provided by Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins
   University. Cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10%
25 FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 Ig/ml streptomycin in humidified
   atmosphere with 5% C02. Cells were passaged twice weekly to maintain
   logarithmic growth.
   3. In Vitro Cell Proliferation Assay (SRB Assay)
                                             7

   The anti-proliferative effects of APTM on cancer cell lines were assessed by
   sulforhodamine B (SRB) colorimetric assay. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates
   at densities of 5,000 cells per well and cultured overnight. Then cells were
   susceptible to APTM at indicated concentrations and cultured for indicated times.
 5 After incubation, attached cells were fixed with 50 ytL cold 50% (w/v)
   trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 1 hour at 40C, washed 5 times with slow-running tap
   water, and stained with 100 ytL 0.4% (w/v) SRB. Optical density at 515 nm
   (OD515) was measured using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices) after
   mixing the protein-bound dye with 200 ytL10 mM Tris base solution (pH 10.5).
10 The relative cell growth rate was determined with the following equation: Relative
   Growth (%) = OD (treated)/OD (control). The IC5o value was defined as the
   concentration required for a 50% reduction in cell growth.
   4. Colony Formation Assay
15 HCT116 cells were plated at 3,000 cells/well in six-well plates and cultured with
   indicated concentrations of APTM for 8 days. Cells were stained with 0.2% (w/v)
   crystal violet in buffered formalin for 20 minutes, and colonies were then
   photographed and quantified as previously described.
20 5. Analysis of Cell Cycle by Flow Cytometry
   Cell cycle distribution was determined by staining DNA with propidium iodide (PI).
   Briefly, 1.0 x 106 cells were incubated with or without APTM for 48 hours. Cells
   were washed with cold PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol at -20 0C for 2 hours. After
   washing with PBS, cells were stained with cold PI solution (20 pg/ml PI and 200
25 pg/ml RNase in PBS) for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The
   percentage of cells in different phases of the cell cycle was determined by flow
   cytometer (BD Bioscience) and analyzed using FlowJo software.
   6. Analysis of Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry
30 Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining method was employed for the apoptosis
   assay in HCT1 16 p53+/+and HCT1 16 p53-/- cells (1x106/well, 6-well plate). After
                                             8

   48 hours of treatment with APTM, cells were harvested in 15 ml centrifuge tubes
   by gentle scraping followed by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 minutes at room
   temperature. Cell suspension was washed two times with cold PBS by
   centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature. Then cells were
 5 harvested, washed twice with cold PBS, and resuspended in 1 x binding buffer
   (100 IL). Cells were transferred into a 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tubes and stained
   with propidium iodide (5 ytL) and FITC annexin V (5 IL). Cells were briefly
   vortexed after incubation for 15 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Then
   cells were filtered and analyzed by flow cytometry. Total apoptotic cells (FITC
10 Annexin V positive) were counted.
   7. Assessment of cell morphological changes
   Cells were plated in 6-well plates (200,000 cells/well) and treated with indicated
   concentrations of APTM. After incubation for 48 hours, cells were collected,
15 washed with PBS and stained with Hoechst 33258 (11.1 g/ml) in buffered
   formalin solution containing 5.6% NP-40. Apoptotic and living cells were viewed
   through DAPI filter of fluorescence inverted         microscope (Leica DM2500
   Fluorescence Microscope) at 400x magnifications.
20 8. Western Blotting
   HCT116 cells were treated with APTM at indicated concentrations for 48 hours,
   and harvested via trypsinization. Protein samples were prepared by scratching
   cells in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and diluted in
   SDS-PAGE protein sample buffer. Samples were heated for 5 minutes at 1000 C.
25 Protein    concentrations   were   measured     using   Direct  Detect@    Infrared
   Spectrometer (Millipore, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
   Equal amount of proteins were loaded on 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide (PAGE)
   gel. After electrophoresis, gels were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore)
   and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 OC. The membranes were
30 then washed with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
   anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (1:10000, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 45 min
                                             9

   at room temperature. Proteins were visualized with SuperSignal West Dura
   Extended Duration Substrate or SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent
   Substrate (Thermo Scientific) using the Amersham Imager 600 western blotting
   system.

   Example 2
   The in vitro effect of APTM on the proliferation of human colon cancer HCT1 16
   cells and the growth inhibition effect thereof are studied. By employing the p53
   deficient HCT1 16 cells, it was found that induction of apoptosis by APTM is p53
10 dependent.
   1. APTM Inhibits Proliferation of HCT1 16 Cells
   The proliferative effect of APTM on human colon cancer cell line HCT116 was
   examined using SRB assay. HCT116 cells were treated with a series of APTM
15 concentrations of 0.33 ytM, 3.33 ytM and 33.3 ytM for 48 hours. As shown in
   Figure la, APTM reduced cell viability of HCT116 cells in a concentration
   dependent manner, with IC50 value of 6.57 IM. HCT116 cells were then treated
   with 10 ytM of APTM and cytotoxicity was assessed at 24 hours, 48 hours and 72
   hours after the treatment. Consistent with the dose effect of APTM, the growth of
20 HCT1 16 cells was also inhibited in a time-dependent manner as shown in Figure
   1b. After treatment for 24 hours, the relative growth rate of HCT116 cells was
   76.36% and declined to 24.57% after 72 hours. It indicated that APTM inhibited
   the growth of human colon cancer cells HCT116 both concentration- and time
   dependently. This was further proved by long time colony formation assay as
25 shown in Figure 1c. Colony formation ability of HCT116 cells was significantly
   decreased after treatment with APTM at 3.0 ytM and almost vanished at 10.0 ytM.
   These results suggest that APTM is potent in inhibiting the proliferation of
   HCT1 16 cells in vitro.
30 2. APTM does not Inhibit Cell Cycle Progression in HCT1 16 cells
                                            10

   Cell cycle arrest is a key intracellular event contributing to reduced cell
   proliferation. It was checked whether APTM could alter cell cycle progression on
   colon cancer cells. Cell cycle distribution of HCT1 16 cells treated with APTM was
   analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 2, the proportions of cells in
 5 GO/G1, S and G2/M phases were almost unchanged after APTM treatment at
   different concentrations for 48 hours.         It suggests that the reduced cell
   proliferation with APTM treatment is not due to the capture of cell cycle. On the
   other hand, the sub-GO/G1 fraction of cells was increased after APTM treatment
   in a concentration-dependent manner as shown in Figure 2. As cells in sub
10 GO/G1 fraction represent apoptotic cells shown in Figure 2, it reasonably
   suggested that APTM inhibits cell proliferation through induction of apoptosis.
   3. APTM Induces Apoptosis in HCT1 16 Cells
   To further elucidate whether the growth inhibitory activity of APTM resulted from
15 induction of apoptosis, HCT116 cells treated with 0, 3, 10 and 30 yiM of APTM
   for 48 hours were stained with Hoechst and visualized under a fluorescent
   microscope. As shown in Figure 3a, cells treated with APTM exhibits typical
   morphological characteristics of apoptosis, like nuclear fragmentation and
   chromatin condensation. This was further confirmed by flow cytometry analysis
20 of cells stained with annexin V-FITC/PI as shown in Figure 3b. APTM induced
   apoptosis of HCT1 16 cells in a concentration-dependent               manner. The
   percentages of apoptotic cells (annexin V positive) with APTM treatment for 48
   hours were 7.67% at 3 ytM, 20.86% at 10 ytM, and 43.7% at 30 tM, comparing
   with 2.53% of the control as shown in Figure 3c.
25
   The results were further demonstrated by a concentration-dependently induction
   of cleaved nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (cPARP) with APTM treatment
   as shown in Figure 3d. Cleavage of PARP by caspases is a key process during
   apoptosis and thus cPARP is a well-known apoptosis marker. It was found that
30 Bax, a pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member, was also induced by APTM treatment
   as shown in Figure 3c. Upon apoptotic stimuli, Bax undergoes conformational
                                              11

   changes and oligomerizes at the mitochondrial outer membrane to promote its
   permeabilization and the releasing of cytochrome C and consequently activate
   caspases cascade. Since Bax is a known target of p53, a tumor suppressor
   mediating a variety of stress responses, it was reasonably suggested that APTM
 5 induces apoptosis through upregulation of p53 protein. Indeed, p53 protein was
   substantially induced by APTM treatment as shown in Figure 3d. Therefore, it is
   indicated that APTM induces apoptosis in human colon cancer HCT116 cells
   through activation of the p53/Bax/cPARP signaling axis.
10 4. Depletion of p53 Attenuates APTM Effect on Apoptosis and Cell Proliferation
   To test whether the effect of APTM on apoptosis induction and cell proliferation
   inhibition is dependent on p53, an isogenic HCT1 16 cell line lacking p53
   (HCT1 16 p53-I-) is employed for further studies. Comparing with wild type
   HCT1 16 cells (HCT1 16 p53+1+), which showed apoptotic morphological changes
15 with APTM treatment (as shown in Figure 3a), HCT116 p53-- cells reserved
   normal nuclear staining even at a highest concentration of 30 yiM APTM [inventor,
   we understand the highest concentration used in this study is 33.3 yiM, please
   confirm.] as shown in Figure 4a. Consistent with these results, HCT116 p53-/
   cells were resistant to APTM induced apoptosis as analyzed by flow cytometry
20 with annexin V-FITC/PI staining as shown in Figure 4b. It indicated that p53
   protein is essential for APTM induced apoptosis in human colon cancer HCT1 16
   cells. This was subsequently verified by western blotting analysis in Figure 4c, as
   loss of p53 blunted Bax and cPARP expression at different APTM concentrations.
   An anti-proliferative activity of APTM on HCT1 16 p53-/- cells was also tested
25 using SRB assay. As shown in Figure 4d, the IC5o value of APTM on HCT116
   p53-/- cells was greater than 33.3 ytM, which is the highest concentration tested
   in this study. Comparing with the IC5ovalue of 6.57 ytM on HCT116 p53+1+ cells
   (as shown in Figure 1b), there was a more than 5-fold resistance to APTM of the
   p53 deficient cells. These results indicated that the apoptosis induction and
30 growth inhibition activity of APTM are p53-dependent.
                                            12

   Under physiologic conditions, p53 is negatively regulated by E3 ubiquitin ligase
   MDM2 and maintained at low levels. While in response to a wide range of stress
   stimuli, such as DNA damage, oxidative stress, nutrient deprivation, oncogene
   expression and hypoxia, the interaction between p53 and MDM2 is perturbed
 5 and p53 protein is stabilized. Once stabilized, p53 stand as the "guardian of the
   genome" through induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and
   senescence.
   The anti-proliferative effect of APTM on colon cancer HCT1 16 cells with an IC50
10 value of 6.57 ytM is studied. The growth inhibitory effect of APTM on colon
   cancer cells is confirmed by time course experiment and colony formation assay.
   It further shows that APTM induces p53 protein concentration-dependently in
   HCT1 16 p53+1+ cells.
15 One of the most remarkable functions of p53 is the induction of apoptosis. This
   occurs through either the extrinsic death receptor pathway, transcription
   dependent intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, or transcription independent cytosolic
   pathway. The pro-apoptotic protein Bax was induced with p53 protein following
   APTM treatment (as shown in Figure 3d), and the induction of Bax was
20 diminished in HCT116 p53-/- cells (as shown in Figure 4c). So, it reasonably
   suggested that APTM promotes apoptosis through the transcription dependent
   mitochondrial pathway of p53. That is to say, p53 protein stabilized upon APTM
   treatment,   increases    Bax    expression  transcriptionally and promotes     its
   oligomerization and mitochondrial translocation. Bax oligomers insert into
25 mitochondrial outer membrane, and promote the releasing of cytochrome C
   leading caspases activation and apoptosis. On the other hand, p53 induction by
   APTM did not markedly change cell cycle distribution of HCT1 16 p53+/+ cells, as
   shown in Figure 2. This selective induction of apoptosis instead of cell cycle
   arrest may be because of high levels of p53 following APTM treatment, since
30 high level of p53 promotes apoptosis while low level thereof leads to cell cycle
                                             13

   arrest. It is also possible that APTM affects cofactors or other proteins that can
   cooperate with p53 and alter its functions.

   pharmaceutical compositions along with suitable carriers or excipients. In one
   example embodiment, suitable routes of administration may, for example,
20 include oral, rectal, transmucosal,     nasal, or intestinal administration and
   parenteral delivery. The compound or the pharmaceutical composition that
