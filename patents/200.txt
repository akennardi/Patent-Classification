                          CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED CASES
[0001]       The present application claims priority to United States provisional application serial
number 61/611,376, filed March 15, 2012, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by
reference. This is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. , the entire contents of which
are incorporated herein by reference.
                                FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]       The present invention provides solid forms of a compound useful as mutant
selective inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase. The invention also
provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions comprising solid forms of the present
invention and methods of using the compositions in the treatment of various disorders.
[0003]       Protein tyrosine kinases are a class of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a
phosphate group from ATP or GTP to a tyrosine residue located on a protein substrate.
Receptor tyrosine kinases act to transmit signals from the outside of a cell to the inside by
activating secondary messaging effectors via a phosphorylation event. A variety of cellular
processes are promoted by these signals, including proliferation, carbohydrate utilization,
protein synthesis, angiogenesis, cell growth, and cell survival.
[0004]       There is strong precedent for involvement of the EGFR in human cancer because
over 60% of all solid tumors overexpress at least one of these proteins or their ligands.
Overexpression of EGFR is commonly found in breast, lung, head and neck, bladder tumors.
[0005]       Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR have been identified
in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (Lin, N. U.; Winer, E. P., Breast Cancer Res 6:
204-210, 2004). The reversible inhibitors Tarceva (erlotinib) and Iressa (gefitinib) currently
are first-line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer patients with activating mutations. The
most common activating mutations are L858R and delE746-A750.

                                               -2
[0006]      Additionally, in the majority of patients that relapse, acquired drug resistance,
such as by mutation of gatekeeper residue T790M, has been detected in at least half of such
clinically resistant patients. Moreover, T790M may also be pre-existing; there may be an
independent, oncogenic role for the T790M mutation. For example, there are patients with
the L858R/T790M        mutation who never received          gefitinib treatment.   In addition,
germlineEGFRT790M mutations are linked with certain familial lung cancers.
[0007]      Current drugs in development, including second-generation covalent inhibitors,
such as BIBW2992, HKI-272 and PF-0299804, are effective against the T790M resistance
mutation but exhibit dose-limiting toxicities due to concurrent inhibition of WTEGFR.
Accordingly, there remains a need to find mutant-selective EGFR kinase inhibitors useful as
therapeutic agents.
                              SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0008]      It has now been found that the novel solid forms of the present invention, and
compositions thereof, are useful as mutant-selective inhibitors of one or more EGFR kinases
and exhibits desirable characteristics for the same.        In general, these solid forms, and
pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof, are useful for treating or lessening the
severity of a variety of diseases or disorders as described in detail herein.

[0073]      Compound       1   (N-(3-(2-(4-(4-acetylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-methoxyphenylamino)-5
(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-ylamino)phenyl)acrylamide))       is   designated  as   compound
number 1-4 and the synthesis of Compound 1 is described in detail at Example 3 of the '061
application.
[0074]      Compound 1 is active in a variety of assays and therapeutic models demonstrating
selective covalent, irreversible inhibition of mutant EGFR kinase (in enzymatic and cellular
assays). Notably, Compound 1 was found to inhibit human non-small cell lung cancer cell
proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, Compound 1 is useful for treating one or
more disorders associated with activity of mutant EGFR kinase.
[0075]      It would be desirable to provide a solid form of Compound 1 that, as compared to
Compound 1, imparts characteristics such as improved aqueous solubility, stability and ease
of formulation. Accordingly, the present invention provides several solid forms of Compound
1.
[0076]      According to one embodiment, the present invention provides an amorphous form,
a crystalline form, or a mixture thereof. Exemplary solid forms are described in more detail
below.
[0077]      In other embodiments, the present invention provides Compound 1 substantially
free of impurities. As used herein, the term "substantially free of impurities" means that the
compound contains no significant amount of extraneous matter. Such extraneous matter may
include starting materials, residual solvents, or any other impurities that may result from the
preparation of, and/or isolation of, Compound 1. In certain embodiments, at least about 90%

                                              -7
by weight of Compound 1 is present. In certain embodiments, at least about 95% by weight
of Compound 1 is present. In still other embodiments of the invention, at least about 99% by
weight of Compound 1 is present.
[0078]      According to one embodiment, Compound 1 is present in an amount of at least
about 95, 97, 97.5, 98.0, 98.5, 99, 99.5, 99.8 weight percent where the percentages are based
on the total weight of the composition.     According to another embodiment, Compound 1
contains no more than about 5.0 area percentHPLC of total organic impurities and, in certain
embodiments, no more than about 3.0 area percentHPLC of total organic impurities and, in
certain embodiments, no more than about 1.5 area percentHPLC total organic impurities
relative to the total area of the HPLC chromatogram.     In other embodiments, Compound 1
contains no more than about 1.0 area percentHPLC of any single impurity; no more than
about 0.6 area percentHPLC of any single impurity, and, in certain embodiments, no more
than about 0.5 area percentHPLC of any single impurity, relative to the total area of the
HPLC chromatogram.
[0079]      The structure depicted for Compound 1 is also meant to include all tautomeric
forms of Compound 1. Additionally, structures depicted here are also meant to include
compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For
example, compounds having the present structure except for the replacement of hydrogen by
                                                              13
deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a        C- or "C-enriched carbon are
within the scope of this invention.
Solid Forms of Compound 1:
[0080]      It has been found that Compound 1 can exist in a variety of solid forms. Such
forms include polymorphs and amorphous forms. The solid forms can be solvates, hydrates
and unsolvated forms of Compound 1. All such forms are contemplated by the present
invention. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides Compound 1 as a mixture
of one or more solid forms of Compound 1.
[0081]      As used herein, the term polymorphh" refers to the different crystal structures (of
solvated or unsolvated forms) in which a compound can crystallize.

                                             -8
[0082]      As used herein, the term "solvate" refers to a solid form with either a
stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of solvent (e.g., a channel solvate).            For
polymorphs, the solvent is incorporated into the crystal structure.        Similarly, the term
"hydrate" refers to a solid form with either a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of
water. For polymorphs, the water is incorporated into the crystal structure.
[0083]      As used herein, the term "about", when used in reference to a degree 2-theta value
refers to the stated value ± 0.3 degree 2-theta. In certain embodiments, "about" refers to
0.2 degree 2-theta or ± 0.1 degree 2-theta.
[0084]      In certain embodiments, Compound 1 is a crystalline solid.                 In other
embodiments, Compound 1 is a crystalline solid substantially free of amorphous Compound
1. As used herein, the term "substantially free of amorphous Compound 1" means that the
compound contains no significant amount of amorphous Compound 1.                     In certain
embodiments, at least about 90% by weight of crystalline Compound 1 is present, or at least
about 95% by weight of crystalline Compound 1 is present. In still other embodiments of the
invention, at least about 97%, 98% or 99% by weight of crystalline compound 1 is present.
[0085]      In certain embodiments, Compound 1 is a neat or unsolvated crystal form and thus
does not have any water or solvent incorporated into the crystal structure. It has been found
that Compound 1 can exist in at least two distinct neat (i.e., anhydrous) crystal forms, or
polymorphs.       In some embodiments, the present invention provides an anhydrous
polymorphic form of Compound 1 referred to herein as Form A. In other embodiments, the
present invention provides an anhydrous polymorphic form of Compound 1 referred to herein
as Form B.
[0086]      In certain embodiments, the present invention provides Form A of Compound 1.
According to one embodiment, Form A of Compound 1 is characterized by one or more
peaks in its powder X-ray diffraction pattern selected from those at about 6.73, about 18.30,
about 18.96 and about 25.48 degrees 2-theta. In some embodiments, Form A of Compound 1
is characterized by two or more peaks in its powder X-ray diffraction pattern selected from
those at about 6.73, about 18.30, about 18.96 and about 25.48 degrees 2-theta.        In certain
embodiments, Form A of Compound 1 is characterized by three or more peaks in its powder
X-ray diffraction pattern selected from those at about 6.73, about 18.30, about 18.96 and

                                               -9

General Methods of Providing Compound 1:
[00110]      Compound 1 is prepared according to the methods described in detail in the
'061 application, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.     The
various solid forms of Compound 1 can be prepared by dissolving compound 1 in various
suitable solvents and then causing Compound 1 to return to the solid phase.         Specific
combinations of solvents and conditions under which Compound 1 return to the solid
phase are discussed in greater detail in the Examples.
[00111]     A suitable solvent may solubilize Compound 1, either partially or completely.
Examples of suitable solvents useful in the present invention are a protic solvent, a polar
aprotic solvent, or mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, suitable solvents include an

                                                - 22
ether, an ester, an alcohol, a ketone, or a mixture thereof. In certain embodiments, the
suitable solvent is methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetone wherein said solvent is
anhydrous or in combination with water, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) or heptane. In
other     embodiments,        suitable    solvents     include     tetrahydrofuran,   1,4-dioxane,
dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, glyme, diglyme, methyl ethyl ketone, N-methyl-2
pyrrolidone, methyl t-butyl ether, t-butanol, n-butanol, and acetonitrile.             In another
embodiment, the suitable solvent is anhydrous ethanol. In some embodiments, the suitable
solvent is MTBE.
[00112]      According to another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for
preparing a solid form of Compound 1, comprising the steps of dissolving Compound 1
with a suitable solvent and optionally heating to form a solution thereof; and isolating
Compound 1.
[00113]      As described generally above, Compound 1 is dissolved in a suitable solvent,
optionally with heating. In certain embodiments Compound 1 is dissolved at about 50 to
about 60 'C. In other embodiments, Compound 1 is dissolved at about 50 to about 55 'C.
In still other embodiments, Compound 1 is dissolved at the boiling temperature of the
solvent. In other embodiments, Compound 1 is dissolved without heating (e.g., at ambient
temperature, approximately 20-25 C).
[00114]      In certain embodiments, Compound 1 precipitates from the mixture. In another
embodiment, Compound 1 crystallizes from the mixture.                     In other embodiments,
Compound 1 crystallizes from solution following seeding of the solution (i.e., adding
crystals of Compound 1 to the solution).
[00115]      Crystalline Compound 1 can precipitate out of the reaction mixture, or be
generated by removal of part or all of the solvent through methods such as evaporation,
distillation, filtration (e.g., nanofiltration, ultrafiltration), reverse osmosis, absorption and
reaction, by adding an anti-solvent (e.g., water, MTBE and/or heptane), by cooling (e.g.,
crash cooling) or by different combinations of these methods.
[00116]      As described generally above, Compound 1 is optionally isolated. It will be
appreciated that Compound 1 may be isolated by any suitable physical means known to

embodiments isolated Compound 1 is dried under reduced pressure, optionally at elevated
temperature.
Uses, Formulation and Administration
Pharmaceutically Acceptable Compositions
[00119]     According to another embodiment, the invention provides a composition
comprising Compound 1 and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle.
The amount of Compound 1 in compositions of this invention is such that it is effective to
measurably inhibit a protein kinase, particularly an EGFR kinase, or a mutant thereof, in a
biological sample or in a patient. In certain embodiments, a composition of this invention
is formulated for administration to a patient in need of such composition.          In some
embodiments, a composition of this invention is formulated for oral administration to a
patient.
[00120]     The term "patient", as used herein, means an animal, preferably a mammal, and
most preferably a human.
[00121]     The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle" refers to a
non-toxic carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle that does not destroy the pharmacological activity of
the compound with which it is formulated. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants
or vehicles that may be used in the compositions of this invention include, but are not
limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as
human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid,
potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts
or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium
hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate,
polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, Vitamin E
polyethylene glycol succinate (d-alpha tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate),

                                              - 24
sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene
block polymers, and wool fat.
[00122]     Compositions of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally,
by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted
reservoir.   The term "parenteral" as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous,
intramuscular,    intra-articular,  intra-synovial,   intrasternal, intrathecal,  intrahepatic,
intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques. Preferably, the compositions
are administered orally, intraperitoneally or intravenously. Sterile injectable forms of the
compositions of this invention may be an aqueous or oleaginous suspension.               These
suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable
dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may
also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable
diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol.       Among the acceptable
vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic
sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a
solvent or suspending medium.
[00123]     For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic
mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are
useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils,
such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil
solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such
as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents that are commonly used in the
formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and
suspensions.    Other commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other
emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the
manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also
be used for the purposes of formulation.
[00124]     Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may be orally
administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules,
tablets, aqueous and non-aqueous suspensions or solutions. In the case of tablets for oral
use, carriers commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as

                                            -25
magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form,
useful diluents include lactose and dried cornstarch.        When aqueous suspensions are
required for oral use, the active ingredient is typically combined with emulsifying and
suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents may also be
added.
[00125]     Alternatively, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may
be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration.         These can be
prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at room
temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release
the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.
[00126]      Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may also be
administered topically, especially when the target of treatment includes areas or organs
readily accessible by topical application, including diseases of the eye, the skin, or the
lower intestinal tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these
areas or organs.
[00127]      Topical application for the lower intestinal tract can be effected in a rectal
suppository formulation (see above) or in a suitable enema formulation.            Topically
transdermal patches may also be used.
[00128]      For topical applications, provided pharmaceutically acceptable compositions
may be formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or
dissolved in one or more carriers.      Carriers for topical administration of Compound 1
include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene
glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water.
Alternatively, provided pharmaceutically acceptable compositions can be formulated in a
suitable lotion or cream containing the active components suspended or dissolved in one or
more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to,
mineral oil, sorbitanmonostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol,
2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.
[00129]      For ophthalmic use, provided pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may
be formulated as micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or,
preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with or without a

                                            -26
preservative such as benzylalkonium chloride.        Alternatively, for ophthalmic uses, the
pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be formulated in an ointment such as
petrolatum.
[00130]     Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may also be
administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to
techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as
solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption
promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing
or dispersing agents.
[00131]     In some embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this
invention are formulated for oral administration.
[00132]     The amount of Compound 1 that may be combined with the carrier materials to
produce a composition in a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated,
the particular mode of administration. In certain embodiments, provided compositions are
formulated so that a dosage of between 0.01 - 100 mg/kg body weight/day of Compound 1
can be administered to a patient receiving these compositions.
[00133]     It should also be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for
any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the
specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the judgment of the treating
physician and the severity of the particular disease being treated.
Uses of Compounds and Pharmaceutically Acceptable Compositions
[00134]     Compound 1 and compositions described herein are generally useful for the
inhibition of protein kinase activity of one or more enzymes. Examples of kinases that are
inhibited by Compound 1 and compositions described herein and against which the
methods described herein are useful include EGFR kinase or a mutant thereof. It has been
found that Compound 1 is a selective inhibitor of at least one mutation of EGFR, as
compared to wild-type ("WT") EGFR. In certain embodiments, an at least one mutation of
EGFR is T790M. In certain embodiments, the at least one mutation of EGFR is a deletion
mutation. In some embodiments, the at least one mutation of EGFR is an activating

                                                -27
mutation. In certain embodiments, Compound 1 selectively inhibits at least one resistant
mutation and at least one activating mutation as compared to WTEGFR.                    In some
embodiments, Compound 1 selectively inhibits at least one deletion mutation and/or at
least one point mutation, and is sparing as to WTEGFR inhibition.
[00135]      A mutation of EGFR can be selected from T790M (resistant or oncogenic),
L858R (activating), delE746-A750 (activating), G719S (activating), or a combination
thereof.
[00136]      As used herein, the term "selectively inhibits," as used in comparison to
inhibition of WTEGFR, means that Compound 1 inhibits at least one mutation of EGFR
(i.e., at least one deletion mutation, at least one activating mutation, at least one restistant
mutation, or a combination of at least one deletion mutation and at least one point
mutation) in at least one assay described herein (e.g., biochemical or cellular). In some
embodiments, the term "selectively inhibits," as used in comparison to WTEGFR
inhibition means that Compound 1 is at least 50 times more potent, at least 45 times, at
least 40, at least 35, at least 30, at least 25, or at least 20 times more potent as an inhibitor
of at least one mutation of EGFR, as defined and described herein, as compared to
WTEGFR.
[00137]      As used herein, the term "sparing as to WTEGFR" means that a selective
inhibitor of at least one mutation of EGFR, as defined and described above and herein,
inhibits EGFR at the upper limit of detection of at least one assay, such as those described
in the '061 application (e.g., biochemical or cellular as described in detail in Examples 56
58). In vitro assays include assays that determine inhibition of the phosphorylation activity
and/or the subsequent functional consequences, or ATPase activity of activated EGFR
(WT or mutant). Alternate in vitro assays quantitate the ability of the inhibitor to bind to
EGFR (WT or mutant). Inhibitor binding may be measured by radiolabeling the inhibitor
prior to binding, isolating the inhibitor/EGFR (WT or mutant) complex and determining
the amount of radiolabel bound. Alternatively, inhibitor binding may be determined by
running a competition experiment where new inhibitors are incubated with EGFR (WT or
mutant) bound to known radioligands.           In some embodiments, the term "sparing as to
WTEGFR" means that Compound 1 inhibits WTEGFR with an IC 50 of at least 10 pM, at

                                             -28
least 9 pM, at least 8 ptM, at least 7 pM, at least 6 pM, at least 5 pM, at least 3 pM, at least
2 pM, or at least 1 pM.
[00138]      In certain embodiments, Compound 1 selectively inhibits (a) at least one
activating mutation; and (b) T790M; and (c) is sparing as to WT. In some embodiments,
an at least one activating mutation is a deletion mutation. In some embodiments, an at
least one activating mutation is a point mutation. In some embodiments, an activating
mutation is delE746-A750. In some embodiments, an activating mutation is L858R. In
some embodiments, an activating mutation is G719S.
[00139]      In some embodiments, the at least one mutation of EGFR is L858R and/or
T790M.
[00140]      Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that
administration of Compound 1 to a patient having at least one activating mutation may
preempt formation of the T790M resistance mutation. Thus, in certain embodiments, the
present invention provides a method for inhibiting an activating mutation in a patient
comprising administering to the patient Compound 1 or composition thereof, as described
herein.
[00141]      One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that certain patients have an
oncogenic form of the T790M mutation, i.e., the T790M mutation is present prior to
administrating any EGFR kinase inhibitor to a patient and is therefore oncogenic.
Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a method for inhibiting
oncogenic T790M in a patient comprising administering to the patient a provided
compound or composition thereof, as described herein.
[00142]      In certain embodiments, the amount of Compound 1 in a composition is
effective to measurably inhibit at least one mutant of EGFR selectively as compared to
WTEGFR and other protein kinases (e.g., ErbB2, ErbB4, a TEC-kinase, and/or JAK3), in a
biological sample or in a patient.
[00143]      As used herein, the terms "treatment," "treat," and "treating" refer to reversing,
alleviating, delaying the onset of, or inhibiting the progress of a disease or disorder, or one
or more symptoms thereof, as described herein. In some embodiments, treatment may be
administered after one or more symptoms have developed.                In other embodiments,
treatment may be administered in the absence of symptoms. For example, treatment may

                                           -29
be administered to a susceptible individual prior to the onset of symptoms (e.g., in light of
a history of symptoms and/or in light of genetic or other susceptibility factors). Treatment
may also be continued after symptoms have resolved, for example to prevent or delay their
recurrence.
[00144]     Compound 1 is an inhibitor of at least one mutant of EGFR and is therefore
useful for treating one or more disorders associated with activity of one of more EGFR
mutants (e.g., a deletion mutation, an activating mutation, a resistant mutation, or
combination thereof).   Thus, in certain embodiments, the present invention provides a
method for treating a mutant EGFR-mediated disorder comprising the step of
administering to a patient in need thereof Compound 1, or pharmaceutically acceptable
composition thereof.
[00145]     As used herein, the term "mutant EGFR-mediated" disorders or conditions as
used herein means any disease or other deleterious condition in which at least one mutant
of EGFR is known to play a role. In certain embodiments, an at least one mutant of EGFR
is T790M. In some embodiments, the at least one mutant of EGFR is a deletion mutation.
In certain embodiments, the at least one mutant of EGFR is an activating mutation. In
some embodiments, the at least one mutant of EGFR is L858R and/or T790M. In certain
embodiments, Compound 1 selectively inhibits (a) at least one activating mutation, (b)
T790M, and (c) is sparing as to WT. In some embodiments, an at least one activating
mutation is a deletion mutation. In some embodiments, an at least one activating mutation
is a point mutation. In some embodiments, an activating mutation is delE746-A750. In
some embodiments, an activating mutation is L858R. In some embodiments, an activating
mutation is G719S.
[00146]     Accordingly, another embodiment of the present invention relates to treating or
lessening the severity of one or more diseases in which at least one mutant of EGFR is
known to play a role. Specifically, the present invention relates to a method of treating or
lessening the severity of a disease or condition selected from a proliferative disorder,
wherein said method comprises administering to a patient in need thereof a compound or
composition according to the present invention.
[00147]     In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating or
lessening the severity of one or more disorders selected from a cancer.             In some

                                              - 30
embodiments, the cancer is associated with a solid tumor. In certain embodiments, the
cancer is breast cancer, glioblastoma, lung cancer, cancer of the head and neck, colorectal
cancer, bladder cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer. In some embodiments, the present
invention provides a method for treating or lessening the severity of one or more disorders
selected from squamous cell carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, or
pancreatic cancer.
[00148]      In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating or
lessening the severity of neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), neurofibromatosis type II (NF2)
Schwann cell neoplasms (e.g. MPNST's), or Schwannomas.
[00149]      Compound 1 and compositions thereof, according to the method of the present
invention, may be administered using any amount and any route of administration effective
for treating or lessening the severity of a cancer. The exact amount required will vary from
subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the
severity of the infection, the particular agent, its mode of administration, and the like.
Compound 1 is preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and
uniformity of dosage.      The expression "dosage unit form" as used herein refers to a
physically discrete unit of agent appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be
understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the
present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound
medical judgment. The specific effective dose level for any particular patient or organism
will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity
of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition
employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of
administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound
employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with
the specific compound employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts.
[00150]      Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be administered
to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally,
intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an oral or
nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In certain
embodiments, Compound 1 may be administered orally or parenterally at dosage levels of

                                             -31
about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 25
mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired
therapeutic effect.
[00151]      Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to,
pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups
and elixirs. In addition to Compound 1, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents
commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents
and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate,
benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, polyethylene glycol (e.g., PEG 200, PEG 400, PEG 1000,
PEG 2000), propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular,
cottonseed,    groundnut,    corn,   germ,   olive,   castor,  and   sesame   oils),  glycerol,
tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, Vitamin E polyethylene glycol succinate (d-alpha tocopheryl
polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate), polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan,
and mixtures thereof.       Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include
adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening,
flavoring, and perfuming agents. The liquid forms above can also be filled into a soft or
hard capsule to form a solid dosage form.         Suitable capsules can be formed from, for
example,      gelatin,   strach    and   cellulose    derivatives   (e.g.,   hydroxycellulose,
hydropropylmethylcellulose).
[00152]      Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous
suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or
wetting agents and suspending agents.       The sterile injectable preparation may also be a
sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable
diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable
vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and
isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally
employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be
employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic
acid are used in the preparation of injectables.
[00153]      Injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a
bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid

                                             - 32
compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable
medium prior to use.
[00154]     In order to prolong the effect of Compound 1 of the present invention, it is
often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or
intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of
crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the
compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal
size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered
compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil
vehicle.   Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the
compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon
the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the
rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers
include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides).      Depot injectable formulations are also
prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible
with body tissues.
[00155]     Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories
which can be prepared by mixing Compound 1 of this invention with suitable non-irritating
excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which
are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the
rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.
[00156]     Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills,
powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, Compound 1 is mixed with at least one
inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium
phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose,
mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose,
alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as
glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar--agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca
starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents
such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g)
wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents

                                            -33
such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate,
magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures
thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise
buffering agents.
[00157]     Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and
hard-filled capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high
molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets,
dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as
enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art.
They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they
release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal
tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be
used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may
also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled capsules using such excipients as lactose
or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.
[00158]     Compound 1 can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more
excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and
granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release
controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art.
In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert
diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is
normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants
and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the
case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents.
They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they
release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal
tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be
used include polymeric substances and waxes.
[00159]     Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of Compound 1 include
ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches.
The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically

                                             - 34
acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic
formulation, ear drops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of
this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal
patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound
to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in
the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the
compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling
membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.
[00160]     According to another embodiment, the invention relates to a method of
inhibiting at least one mutant of EGFR (e.g., a deletion mutation, an activating mutation, a
resistant mutations, or combination thereof) activity in a biological sample comprising the
step of contacting said biological sample with Compound 1, or a composition comprising
the compound. In certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method of irreversibly
inhibiting at least one mutant of EGFR (e.g., a deletion mutation, an activating mutation, a
resistant mutation, or combination thereof) activity in a biological sample comprising the
step of contacting the biological sample with Compound 1, or a composition comprising
the compound.
[00161]     In certain embodiments, Compound 1 selectively inhibits in a biological sample

and anti-viral agents; agents for treating blood disorders such as corticosteroids, anti
leukemic agents, and growth factors; and agents for treating immunodeficiency disorders
such as gamma globulin.
[00171]     In certain embodiments, Compound 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable
composition thereof is administered in combination with a monoclonal antibody or an
siRNA therapeutic.
[00172]     The additional agents may be administered separately from a Compound 1
containing composition, as part of a multiple dosage regimen. Alternatively, those agents
may be part of a single dosage form, mixed together with Compound 1 in a single
composition. If administered as part of a multiple dosage regime, the two active agents
may be submitted simultaneously, sequentially or within a period of time from one another
(e.g., one hour, two hours, six hours, twelve hours, one day, one week, two weeks, one
month).
[00173]     As used herein, the terms "combination," "combined," and related terms refer
to the simultaneous or sequential administration of therapeutic agents in accordance with
this invention. For example, Compound 1 may be administered with another therapeutic
agent simultaneously or sequentially in separate unit dosage forms or together in a single
unit dosage form. Accordingly, the present invention provides a single unit dosage form
comprising Compound 1, an additional therapeutic agent, and a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle.
[00174]     The amount of Compound 1 and additional therapeutic agent (in those
compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent as described above) that may
be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary
depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Preferably,
compositions of this invention should be formulated so that a dosage of between 0.01 - 100
mg/kg body weight/day of Compound 1 can be administered.

                                             -39
[00175]      In those compositions that include an additional therapeutic agent, that
additional therapeutic agent and Compound 1 may act synergistically.          Therefore, the
amount of additional therapeutic agent in such compositions may be less than that required
in a monotherapy utilizing only that therapeutic agent. In such compositions, a dosage of
between 0.01 - 1,000 tg/kg body weight/day of the additional therapeutic agent can be
administered.
[00176]      The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of this
invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a
composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent. Preferably the
amount of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range
from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition comprising that
agent as the only therapeutically active agent.
[00177]      Compound 1 or pharmaceutical compositions thereof may also be incorporated
into compositions for coating an implantable medical device, such as prostheses, artificial
valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Vascular stents, for example, have been used
to overcome restenosis (re-narrowing of the vessel wall after injury). However, patients
using stents or other implantable devices risk clot formation or platelet activation. These
unwanted effects may be prevented or mitigated by pre-coating the device with a
pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a kinase inhibitor.          Implantable
devices coated with Compound 1 are another embodiment of the present invention.
[00178]      All features of each of the aspects of the invention apply to all other aspects
mutatis mutandis.
[00179]      In order that the invention described herein may be more fully understood, the
following examples are set forth. It should be understood that these examples are for
illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting this invention in any
manner.

Step 1:
[00182]        In a 25 mL 3-neck round-bottom flask previously equipped with a magnetic
stirrer, Thermo pocket and CaCl 2 guard tube, N-Boc-1,3-diaminobenzene (0.96 g) and n
butanol (9.00 mL) were charged. The reaction mixture was cooled to 00 C. 2,4-Dichloro-5
trifluoromethylpyrimidine (1.0 g) was added dropwise to the above reaction mixture at 0
'C.Diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (0.96 mL) was dropwise added to the above reaction
mixture at 0 C and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 hr at 0 C to 5 C. Finally, the
reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. The reaction mixture was
stirred for another 4 hrs at room temperature. Completion of reaction was monitored by
TLC using hexane: ethyl acetate (7: 3). The solid precipitated out was filtered off and
washed with 1-butanol (2 mL). The solid was dried under reduced pressure at 40 C for 1
hr. 'H-NMR (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz) 6 1.48 (S, 9 H), 7.02 (m, 1 H), 7.26 (m, 2 H), 7.58 (S,
1 H), 8.57 (S, 1 H), 9.48 (S, 1 H), 9.55 (S, 1 H).
Step 2:
[00183]        To the above crude (3.1 g) in dichloromethane (DCM) (25 mL) was added
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (12.4 mL) slowly at 0 C. The reaction mixture was allowed to
warm to room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred for another 10 min at room
temperature. The crude was concentrated under reduced pressure.
Step 3:

                                             -41
[00184]     The concentrated crude was dissolved in DIPEA (2.0 mL) and dichloromethane
(25 mL), and then cooled to -30 'C. To the reaction mixture was slowly added acryloyl
chloride (0.76 g) at -30 'C. The reaction mass was warmed to room temperature stirred at
room temperature for 1.0 hr. The reaction was monitored on TLC using hexane: ethyl
acetate (7:3) as mobile phase. The reaction was completed after 1 hr.             Step 3 yielded
intermediate 1.
Step 4:
[00185]     To obtain a salt of compound 1, a mixture of intermediate 1 (16 mg) and 2
methoxy-4-(4-acetylpiperazinyl)aniline in dioxane (1.0 mL) with catalytic trifluoroacetic
acid was stirred overnight at 50 C. The crude was concentrated under reduced pressure
and purified using HPLC (TFA modifier) to give compound 1 as a TFA salt. IH-NMR

found: 556.2 (M+H).
Step 5:
[00186]     To obtain the free base form of Compound 1 from the TFA salt, the salt was
added to DCM and cooled to 00 C. Na 2 CO 3 solution (9.6% w/w) was added at 00 C. The
mixture was warmed to 20'C and stirred for 35 min. The pH of the aqueous layer was > 8.
The layers were separated. Extraction of the aqueous layer was performed using DCM.
The organic layers were combined and washed with brine. The organic layer was collected
and evaporated to yield a solid of Compound 1.
General Procedures
[00187]     X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis was carried out on a Siemens
D5000, scanning the samples between 3 and 30 or 50'2-theta.For samples <100 mg, ca. 5
10 mg of sample was gently compressed onto a glass slide which fitted into the sample
holder. For samples >100 mg, ca. 100 mg of sample was gently compressed into a plastic
sample holder, so that the sample surface was smooth and just above the level of the
sample holder. Measurements were made as follows:

[00188]     In polarized      light microscopy    (PLM),  the   presence   of crystallinity
(birefringence) was determined using an Olympus BX50 polarising microscope, equipped
with a Motic camera and image capture software (Motic Images Plus 2.0). All images
were recorded using the 20x objective, unless otherwise stated.
[00189]     For thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), approximately 5-10 mg of material was
accurately weighed into an open aluminium pan and loaded into a simultaneous
thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyser (TG/DTA) and held at room temperature.
The sample was then heated at a rate of 100 C/min from 25 0 C to 300 0 C during which time
the change in sample weight was recorded along with any differential thermal events
(DTA). Nitrogen was used as the purge gas, at a flow rate of 100 cm3/min.
[00190]     For differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), approximately 5-10 mg of
material was weighed into an aluminium DSC pan and sealed non-hermetically with a
pierced aluminium lid. The sample pan was then loaded into a Seiko DSC6200 (equipped
with a cooler) cooled and held at 25 0 C. Once a stable heat-flow response was obtained,
the sample and reference were heated to ca. 260 0 C at scan rate of 100 C/min and the
resulting heat flow response monitored.

                                            - 43
[00191]      IH-NMR experiments were performed on a BrukerAV400 ('H frequency: 400
MHz).     1H  experiments of each sample were performed in deuteratedDMSO and each
sample was prepared to ca. 10 mg concentration.
[00192]      For dynamic vapour sorption (DVS), approximately 10 mg of sample was
placed into a wire mesh vapour sorption balance pan and loaded into a DVS-1
dynamicvapour sorption balance by Surface Measurement Systems.              The sample was
subjected to a ramping profile from 20 - 90 % relative humidity (RH) at 10 % increments,
maintaining the sample at each step until a stable weight had been achieved (99.5 % step
completion). After completion of the sorption cycle, the sample was dried using the same
procedure, but all the way down to 0 % RH and finally taken back to the starting point of
20 % RH. The weight change during the sorption/desorption cycles were plotted, allowing
for the hygroscopic nature of the sample to be determined.
[00193]      Infrared spectroscopy (IR) was carried out on a Bruker ALPHA P spectrometer.
Sufficient material was placed onto the centre of the plate of the spectrometer and the
spectra were obtained using the following parameters: resolution - 4 cm- 1, background
scan time - 16 scans, sample scan time - 16 scans, data collection 4000 to 400 cm-1 , result
spectrum - transmittance.
[00194]      For Karl Fischer (KF) Coulometric titration, 10-15 mg of solid material was
accurately weighed into a vial. The solid was then manually introduced into the titration
cell of a Mettler Toledo C30 Compact Titrator. The vial was back-weighed after the
addition of the solid and the weight of the added solid entered on the instrument. Titration
was initiated once the sample had fully dissolved in the cell.      The water content was
calculated automatically by the instrument as a percentage and the data printed.
[00195]      Reverse-phase gradient high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was
performed on an Agilent 1100 instrument fitted with a C18, 3.0 x 100 mm x 3.5 pm
column. The detection wavelength was 240 nm.
[00196]     A SotaxAT7 dissolution bath (USP 2, EP 2 apparatus) was used for the
dissolution study in which paddles were used to stir the media. All tests were carried out at
37'C and a paddle speed of 100 rpm.

[00197]      Samples of each form were exposed to an environment of 40'C/75%RH for 1
week and 2 week periods to determine stability. Resulting solids were analysed by XRPD
and HPLC to establish if any changes had occurred.
[00198]      Slurries of all each polymorphic form were created in deionised water and
shaken for ca. 24 hours. The resulting solid was then analysed by HPLC to determine the
concentration of material dissolved.
                                          Example 1
                                   Preparation of Form A
[00199]      ca. 120 mg of Compound 1 was weighed into a vial and slurried in ca. 2ml of
acetonitrile. This was temperature cycled between ca.00 C and ambient (ca.220 C) whilst
stirring in 2 hour cycles for a period of 2-3 days. Overnight, the sample was kept at ca.2
50 C. Solid material was isolated and left to dry under vacuum for 7 days.
[00200]      XRPD analysis (Figure 1) showed the material to be crystalline. PLM analysis
(not shown) indicated very fine, birefringent needle-like crystals. TGA/DTA (Figure 2)
showed a 0.4% weight loss from the outset to ca. 150'C likely due to unbound solvent. No
significant weight losses seen prior to degradation. DSC analysis (Figure 3) showed a
single endotherm at onset ca. 203.2'C (peak 207.5'C) due to the melt. IR analysis (Figure
4) corresponds with the input freebase material.       1HNMR    (not shown) carried out in
deuteratedDMSO showed a spectrum which corresponded with the input freebase.
Acetonitrile does not appear to be present. DVS analysis (Figure 5) showed a water
uptake of 0.87% between 20 and       7 0% RH, indicating a non-hygroscopic material. Post
DVS XRPD indicated that the material remained Form A (data not shown).                  No
polymorphic form changes were evident. Some loss in crystallinity was observed. KF
analysis did not detect the presence of water. HPLC purity analysis indicated a purity of
ca. 97.6%. Form A could not be detected by HPLC analysis for the aqueous solubility.
The aqueous solubility is therefore poor.
[00201]      XRPD analysis after 1 week storage (open container) at 40'C/75%RH showed
the material to still be consistent with Form A, with some loss in crystallinity. HPLC
analysis indicated a purity of ca. 97.5%.       XRPD analysis after 2 week storage (open

                                             -45
container) at 40'C/75%RH showed the material to still be consistent with Form A,
however, it became poorly crystalline. HPLC analysis indicated a purity of ca. 96.3%.

[00202]      ca. 120 mg of Compound 1 was weighed into a vial and slurried in ca. 2 ml
tetrahydrofuran. This was temperature cycled between ca. 00 C and ambient (ca. 22'C)
whilst stirring in 2 hour cycles for a period of 2-3 days. Overnight, the sample was kept at
ca. 2-5'C.     Solid material was isolated and left to dry under vacuum at ambient for 7 days
and at 40'C for a further 2 days.
[00203]      XRPD analysis (Figure 6) showed the material produced to be crystalline.
PLM analysis (not shown) indicated birefringent, rod-like crystals. TGA/DTA (Figure 7)
showed no significant weight losses prior to degradation after drying for 7 days at ambient
under vacuum, and a further 2 days at 40'C.             DSC analysis (Figure 8) showed an
endotherm at onset 153.6'C (peak 157.60) directly followed by an exotherm at peak
161.3'C indicating a polymorphic transition. A further small endotherm is present at peak
186.0'C, followed by a final endotherm at onset 203.9'C (peak 207.9'C) which appears to
correspond with the Form A melt.IR analysis (Figure 9) showed a significant number of
differences and shifts in comparison to Form A.           1HNMR   (not shown) carried out in
deuteratedDMSO showed a spectrum which corresponded with the input freebase.Traces
of THF appear to be present. DVS analysis (Figure 10) showed a water uptake of 0.74%
between 20 and 70% RH, indicating a non-hygroscopic material. Post DVS XRPD (not
shown) indicated that the material remained Form B. No polymorphic form changes were
evident. KF (not shown) analysis indicated the presence of ca. 0.97% water. HPLC purity
analysis indicated a purity of ca. 97.0%. Form B could not be detected by HPLC analysis
for the aqueous solubility. The aqueous solubility is therefore poor.
[00204]      XRPD analysis after 1 week storage (open container) at 40'C/75%RH showed
the material to be predominantly amorphous.          HPLC analysis indicated a purity of ca.
96.8%. XRPD analysis after 2 week storage (open container) at 40'C/75%RH showed the
material to be predominantly amorphous. HPLC analysis indicated a purity of ca. 95.9%.

[00205]     In order to determine the relationship between Forms A and B, a sample of
Form B was heated to 120'C and then XRPD analysis was carried out. The XRPD showed
a mixture of Form B and Form A, indicating that as Form B is heated, it starts to convert to
Form A. Form B was also heated to 160'C (temperature above phase transition seen in
DSC) and then XRPD analysis was carried out which indicated that the material converted
predominantly to Form A at this temperature. The comparative XRPD results are shown in
Figure 11.

                                  Preparation of Form C
[00206]     ca. 120 mg of Compound 1 was weighed into a vial and slurried in ca. 100 pl of
DMF.     This was temperature cycled between ca. 00 C and ambient (ca. 22'C) whilst
stirring in 2 hour cycles. After ca. 2 hours, a further 300pl of DMF was added. The
temperature cycling was continued for a period of 2-3 days. Overnight, the sample was
kept at ca. 2-5'C. Solid material was isolated and left to dry under vacuum at ambient for
7 days and at 40'C for a further 2 days.
[00207]     XRPD analysis (Figure 12) showed the material to be crystalline.              PLM
analysis (not shown) indicated birefringent, rod-like crystals.      TGA/DTA (Figure 13)
showed a weight loss of ca. 8.2%. (11.6 wt% DMF required for a mono solvate) after
drying for 7 days at ambient under vacuum and a further 2 days at 40'C. DSC analysis
(Figure 14) showed a broad endotherm between 85-125'C, corresponding with the weight
loss in the TGA. A final endotherm is seen at onset ca. 204.4'C (peak 208.3'C)
corresponding with the Form A melt.IR analysis (Figure 15) showedsome differences and
shifts in comparison with Form A.     1HNMR     (not shown) carried out in deuteratedDMSO
showed a spectrum whichcorresponds with the input freebase with some DMF present (ca.
3:1 API: DMF). DVS analysis (Figure 16) corresponded with the TGA data where the
material is seen to contain solvent, which is lost as the relative humidity is increased. Post
DVS XRPD (not shown) indicated that the material converted to Form A during DVS
analysis. KF analysis (not shown) indicated the presence of ca. 0.01% water. HPLC

                                             - 47
purity analysis indicated a purity of ca. 97.3%. Form C could not be detected by HPLC
analysis for the aqueous solubility. The solubility is therefore poor.
[00208]      XRPD analysis after 1 week storage (open container) at 40'C/75%RH showed
the material converted to Form A with some loss in crystallinity. HPLC analysis indicated
a purity of ca. 97.1%.        XRPD analysis after 2 week storage (open container) at
40'C/75%RH showed the material to be poorly crystalline with the peaks present
corresponding with Form A. HPLC analysis indicated a purity of ca. 96.8%.               The
comparative XRPD results are shown in Figure 17.
[00209]      To determine whether Form C remains the same after losing the solvent
present, a sample of Form C was heated to 120'C (i.e.,just past the temperature at which
the solvent is removed) and then XRPD analysis was carried out. The XRPD showed that
the material had converted to Form A. Similarly, after drying at ambient temperature
under vacuum for 7 days and then for a further 2 days at 40'C, Form C showed some loss
in crystallinity and converted to Form A. The comparative XRPD results are shown in
Figure 18.

[00210]      ca. 120 mg of Compound 1 was weighed into a vial and slurried in ca. 2 ml of
1,4-dioxane. This was temperature cycled between ca. 00 C and ambient (ca. 22'C) whilst
stirring in 2 hour cycles for a period of 2-3 days. Overnight, the sample was kept at ca. 2
5'C. Solid material was isolated and left to dry under vacuum at ambient for 7 days and at
40'C for a further 2 days.
[00211]      XRPD analysis showed that the preparation of Form D provided above resulted
in a mixture of Form B and Form D (Figure 19). PLM analysis indicated birefringent,
rod-like crystals (not shown). TGA/DTA (Figure 20A) showed a weight loss of ca. 5.5%
between 60-100'C after drying for 7 days at ambient under vacuum. After drying for 7
days at ambient under vacuum, and a further 2 days at 40'C, the TGA (Figure 20B)
showed a weight loss of ca. 1.4% between 100-150'C. DSC analysis after 40'C drying
(Figure 21) showed a very small exotherm at ca. 146'C. A final endotherm was then seen

                                             -48
at onset ca. 202.61C (peak 207.4'C) corresponding with the Form A melt. IR analysis
(Figure 22) corresponded with the spectrum of Form B, with small 1,4-dioxane peaks
present.   1H-NMR     (not shown) carried out in deuteratedDMSO after 7 days of drying at
ambient temperature under vacuum showed a spectrum whichcorresponds with the input
free base with some 1,4-dioxane present (ca. 2:1 API: 1,4-Dioxane).DVS analysis (Figure
23) corresponded with the TGA data where the material is seen to contain solvent which is
lost as the relative humidity is increased. Post DVS XRPD (not shown) indicated that the
material converted completely to Form B during DVS analysis. KF analysis (not shown)
indicated the presence of ca. 1.1% water. HPLC purity analysis indicated a purity of ca.
96.6%.     Form D could not be detected by HPLC analysis for the aqueous solubility. The
solubility is therefore extremely poor.
[00212]     XRPD analysis after 1 week storage (open container) at 40'C/75%RH showed
the material converted completely to Form B with some loss in crystallinity.          HPLC
analysis indicated a purity of ca. 96.5%.       XRPD analysis after 2 week storage (open
container) at 40'C/75%RH showed the material to be poorly crystalline with the peaks
present corresponding with Form B. HPLC analysis indicated a purity of ca. 95.5%. The
comparative XRPD results are shown in Figure 24.

[00213]      ca. 120 mg of Compound 1 was weighed into a vial and ca. 12 ml of MEK was
then added in attempts to dissolve the material. A very thin slurry resulted and this was
then filtered to obtain a saturated solution. The solution was placed at ca. -18'C for crash
cooling for 2-3 days. Solid material was isolated and left to dry under vacuum at ambient
for 7 days and at 40'C for a further 2 days.
[00214]     XRPD analysis (Figure 25) showed the material to be crystalline.           PLM
analysis (not shown) indicated birefringent, thin, rod-like crystals. TGA/DTA (Figure 26)
showed a weight loss of ca. 5.2% between ca. 70-110 C after drying for 7 days at ambient
under vacuum. DSC analysis (Figure 27) showed a broad endotherm between 70-1 100 C,
corresponding with the weight loss in the TGA. A final endotherm is seen at onset ca.
198.4' C (peak 203.3'C).          IR analysis (Figure 28) showed some small shifts in

comparison with Form A.        1H-NMR    (not shown) carried out in deuteratedDMSO after 7
days of drying at ambient under vacuum showed a spectrum which corresponds with the
input free base with a non-stoichiometric amount of MEK present. DVS analysis (Figure
29) showed a water uptake of 0.25% between 20 and 70% RH. Post DVS XRPD (not
shown) indicated that the material converted to Form A during DVS analysis. KF analysis
(not shown) indicated the presence of ca. 1.2% water. HPLC purity analysis indicated a
purity of ca. 97.8%. Form E could not be detected by HPLC analysis for the aqueous
solubility. The solubility is therefore extremely poor.
[00215]     XRPD analysis after 1 week storage (open container) at 40'C/75%RH showed
the material to be predominantly amorphous with visible peaks present corresponding with
Form A. HPLC analysis indicated a purity of ca. 97.7%. XRPD analysis after 2 week
storage (open container) at 40'C/75%RH showed the material to be predominantly
amorphous with visible peaks present corresponding with Form A.              HPLC analysis
indicated a purity of ca. 97.3%. The comparative XRPD results are shown in Figure 30.
[00216]     In order to determine whether Form E remains the same after losing the solvent
present, a sample of Form E was heated to 120'C (i.e.,just past the temperature at which
the solvent is lost) and then XRPD analysis was carried out. The XRPD showed that the
material had converted to Form A. Similarly, after drying at ambient under vacuum for 7
days and then for a further 2 days at 40'C, Form E lost some crystallinity and converted to
Form A. The comparative XRPD results are shown in Figure 31.

[00217]     ca. 120 mg of Compound 1 was weighed into a vial and ca.200pl of NMP was
then added in order to dissolve the material. Anti-solvent addition was then carried out by
adding a total of ca.4.5ml of TBME in 500 pl aliquots to obtain a cloudy solution. The
sample was then allowed to stand for ca. 2 hours before the solid was isolated. The solid
material was then left to dry under vacuum at ambient for 7 days and at 40'C for a further
2 days.

grow in clusters. TGA/DTA (Figure 33) showed a weight loss of ca. 10.2% between 70
120'C (15.1 wt% NMP required for a mono solvate) after drying for 7 days at ambient
temperature under vacuum. DSC analysis (Figure 34) showed an endotherm at onset 97'C
(peak 100.9'C) corresponding with the weight loss in the TGA. A final endotherm is seen
at onset ca. 204.2'C (peak 208.3'C) corresponding with the Form A melt.IR analysis
(Figure 35) showed some small shifts in comparison with Form A. IH-NMR (not shown)
carried out in deuteratedDMSO after 7 days of drying at ambient under vacuum showed a

material is seen to contain solvent, which is lost as the relative humidity is increased. Post
DVS XRPD (not shown) indicated that the material converted predominantly to Form A
(traces of Form F remaining).      KF analysis (not shown) indicated the presence of ca.
0.87% water. HPLC purity analysis indicated a purity of ca. 97.0%. Form F could not be
detected by HPLC analysis for the aqueous solubility. The solubility is therefore poor.
[00219]     XRPD analysis after 1 week storage (open container) at 40'C/75%RH showed

in 2 hour cycles for a period of 2-3 days. Overnight, the sample was kept at ca. 2-5'C.
Solid material was isolated and left to dry under vacuum at ambient for 7 days and at 40'C
for a further 2 days. A portion of the solid was also dried at 80'C for ca. 4 days.
[00222]     XRPD analysis (Figure 39) showed the material to be crystalline.            PLM

showedweight losses of ca. 23.6% and 10.2% after drying for 4 days at ambient
temperature under vacuum. After drying for 7 days at ambient temperature under vacuum
and a further 2 days at 40'C, the TGA (Figure 40B) showed a weight loss of ca. 6.3%
between ca. 70-1 10 C.After drying for 4 days at 80'C, the TGA (Figure 40C) showed a
weight loss of ca. 2.8% between ca. 70-110'C. DSC analysis after drying at 80'C (Figure
41) showed an endotherm at onset ca. 205.3'C (peak 210.00 C).IR analysis after 4 days of
ambient temperature drying (Figure 42) showed some shifts in comparison with Form A
and also the presence of NMP.IH-NMR (not shown) carried out in deuteratedDMSO after
4 days of drying at ambient temperature under vacuum corresponded with the input free
base with a significant amount of NMP present. DVS analysis (Figure 43) corresponded
with the TGA data, where the material is seen to contain significant amounts of solvent
that are lost as the relative humidity is increased. Post DVS XRPD (not shown) indicated
that the material converted to Form A. KF analysis (not shown) indicated the presence of
ca. 0.45% water. HPLC purity analysis indicated a purity of ca. 97.0%. Form F in the
HPLC chromatogram           to  determine   aqueous   solubility was below      the limit of
quantification. The aqueous solubility is therefore poor.
[00223]     XRPD analysis after 1 week storage (open container) at 40'C/75%RH showed

From slurrying at both ambient and 60 0 C, the majority of experiments resulted in
conversion to Form A, thus indicating that Form A is likely the more stable form in
comparison with Form B. Form B has been obtained consistently throughout the study
from dichloromethane and tetrahydrofuran. A new polymorphic form, labelled Form H,
was obtained from the competitive slurry carried out in acetone: water (80:20) at 60 0 C.
                                          Example 9
                                   Preparation of Form H
[00226]      ca. 10 mg of Form A and ca. 10mg of Form B were weighed into a vial.
ca.200pl of acetone:water (80:20%) was added to the vial to form a slurry. The sample was
allowed to stir at ca.500 C for 3 days. The solid material was isolated and left to dry at
ambient before analysis was carried out. Further drying was also carried out at 40 0 C for 2
days.
[00227]     XRPD analysis (Figure 46) showed the material to be crystalline, with the
diffractogram different from all identified polymorphic forms. PLM analysis (not shown)
indicated birefringent, block-like crystals. The material visually appeared yellow in colour.

                                             - 53
TGA/DTA (Figure 47) after 2 days of drying at 40'C, showed a 4.4% weight loss from the
outset up to ca. 120'C. The final endotherm in the DTA trace appears to correspond with
the Form A melt. (3.14 wt% is required for 1 mole equivalent of water.)
[00228]     To examine whether Form H changes to Form A after heating to 115'C (point
after the solvent loss), the Form H material was heated to 115'C and XRPD analysis and
DSC analysis were then carried out. The XRPDdiffractogram (Figure 48) after heating
still corresponded with Form H, with some loss in crystallinity likely due to the harsh
heating conditions.     The DSC analysis (Figure 49) indicated overlapping endotherms
between ca. 115-135'C, followed by an exotherm at peak 143.9'C, likely indicating a
polymorphic transition. A final endotherm was present at onset 202.7'C (peak 206.6'C)
corresponding with the Form A melt.
[00229]     To test whether Form H picks up water after desolvating/dehydrating the
material by heating to 11 5'C, a further test was carried out whereby Form H was heated to
115'C in a TGA pan. The sample was then removed from the TGA pan and allowed to sit
on the bench for ca. 1 hour. After 1 hour, another TGA was carried out up to 115'C.TGA
for the sample heated to 115'C showed a ca. 4.2% weight loss of the solvent / water
present (Figure 50). TGA after leaving the desolvated /dehydrated material on the bench
for ca. 1 hour, showed a ca. 3.7% loss up to 115'C (Figure 51). The material therefore
picked up water upon standing at ambient conditions on the bench. This indicates that it is
either hygroscopic or rapidly rehydrates following dehydration /desolvation.
                                         Example 10
                                   Preparation of Form I
[00230]     Approximately ca. 5 mL of acetonitrile: water (10%) was added to ca. 1 g of
Compound 1 free base to form a slurry. In a separate vial, ca. 3 mL of acetonitrile : water
(10%) was added to 1 equivalent of hydrobromic acid (48%). The acid solution was then
added dropwise over a 1 hour period to the free base slurry whilst stirring and maintaining
a temperature between 0-5 'C.     After the complete addition of the acid, a further 3 mL of
acetonitrile : water (10%) was added. The reaction was stirred for ca. 1 day before being
isolated and dried under vacuum at ambient (ca. 22 C). A yield of ca. 79% was obtained.

                                           - 54
[00231]     Compound 1hydrobromide salt material was ground using a Retsch Ball Mill
for ca. 25 minutes, with a 5 minute break midway to prevent the sample from overheating.
[00232]     Approximately 500 mg of amorphous Compound 1hydrobromide salt material
was slurried in ca. 18mL of acetone:water (90:10). The suspension was then temperature
cycled between 4 and 25'C in four hour cycles for ca. 2 days, before being isolated and
dried under vacuum at ambient (ca. 22'C). The secondary screen analysis was carried out
on Form I after drying.
[00233]     Form I was scaled-up for further analysis. During the scale-up, a colour change
was observed from yellow to a light beige/cream colour. XRPD analysis (Figure 52)
showed the material produced from scale-up to be crystalline and predominantly consistent
with the small scale Form I diffractogram. IR and 1HNMR are depicted in Figure 53 and
Figure54, respectively. PLM analysis indicated birefringent, fibrous, needle-like crystals
when wet. Upon drying the material appeared to lose its needle-like morphology,
appearing as small particles with no clearly defined morphology. Hot stage microscopy
indicated melting at ca. 135 'C with some recrystallization occurring at ca. 180 'C,
followed by complete melting by ca. 210 'C. After drying under vacuum for ca. 72 hours,
the TGA/DTA indicated a weight loss of 2.8% from ca. 80 to 120 'C corresponding with
an endotherm in the DTA trace (Figure 55). An exotherm was observed in the DTA trace
at onset ca. 149 'C (peak ca. 166 'C), followed by a further endotherm at onset ca. 197 'C
(peak ca. 201 'C).     After standing at ambient conditions, the TGA/DTA was re-run
showing a weight loss of 2.6% from the outset to ca. 80'C, followed by a further weight
loss of 2.8% between ca. 80 'C and 120 'C corresponding with two endotherms in the
DTA trace (Figure 56). An exotherm was then observed in the DTA trace at onset ca. 155
'C (peak ca. 167 'C) followed by a further endotherm at onset ca. 196 'C (peak ca. 202
'C).    The DSC analysis indicated overlapping endotherms starting from the outset,
followed by an exotherm at onset ca. 138 'C (peak ca. 149 'C) and a further endotherm at
onset ca. 92 'C (peak ca. 200 'C) (Figure 57). DVS analysis (Figure 58) showed the
following observations:
            *  Cycle 1 - Sorption 20-90%RH
               Sample gradually takes up ca. 0.66% mass.
            "  Cycle 2 - Desorption 90-0%RH

                                            - 55
               Between 90-10%RH, sample mass decreases gradually by ca. 1.2%.
               A rapid loss of ca. 2.7% occurs between 10-0%RH.
            9  Cycle 3 - Sorption 0-20%RH
               Moisture uptake of ca. 2.8% between 0-20%RH.
[00234]     The input material containing ca. 5.6% water appeared to be relatively non
hygroscopic. Approximately 1 equivalent of water was lost at the lower RH percentages.
Post DVS XRPD analysis indicated that the material remained as Form I (Figure 59). No
polymorphic form changes were evident. KF analysis indicated the presence of ca.5.4%
water.   HPLC purity analysis indicated a purity of ca. 99.66% (Figure 60).             Ion
chromatography indicated the presence of 1.64% bromide (ca. 12.57% required for 1
equivalent). XRPD analysis carried out on the thermodynamic solubility experiment solids
remaining after 24 hours, indicated that for pH 6.6, 4.5 and 3.0 the material remained as
Form I (Figure 61). For pH 1, the material appeared to be a mixture of Form I and
possibly the HClsalt formed during screening.
[00235]     From the characterisation carried out on Form I, this form was determined to be
a hydrated version of the freebase rather than a bromide salt form. The TGA/DTA and
DVS data appear to suggest that this may be either a hygroscopic monohydrate or a
dihydrate form.
[00236]     7 day Stability Studies at 25'C, 80'C, 40'C/75%RH (open and closed
conditions). Approximately 15mg of Form Iwas placed separately into vials and then
exposed to 25'C, 80'C and 40'C/75%RH environments (open and closed vials) for 1 week
to determine stability. The resulting solids were analysed by XRPD and HPLC to establish
if any changes had occurred. Results are presented in Tables 2 and 3 and Figures 62 and
63.
