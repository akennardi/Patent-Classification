below. The intention, however, is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments
described. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover all modifications, equivalents, and
alternatives falling within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
Description of Embodiments
[0018] In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings
which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in
which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to
enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other
embodiments may be utilized and that structural changes may be made without departing from
the scope of the present invention. Therefore, the following detailed description is not to be
taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended
claims and their equivalents.
[0019] In some embodiments, a composite mouthguard is formed of several different polymeric
materials. At least one of the polymeric materials can include one or more flavorants. In some
embodiments, at least one of the one or more flavorants can include a sweetener. In some
embodiments, individual flavorants are in different polymeric materials, with the polymeric
materials defining different mouthguard layers as desired. In some embodiments, at least one of
the polymeric materials can include two or more distinct flavorants, with one of the flavorants
being a sweetener. In some embodiments, at least one of the polymeric materials can be free of
flavorants.
[0020] Flavors are generally defined as the sensory impression provided to the person detecting
the flavor. The flavor detected by an individual can be a combination of taste and smell.
Examples of tastes include sweet, sour, bitter, salty and other basic tastes. Smells are limitless.
Flavorants are substances that provide a flavor or alter the detected flavor. Flavorants can be
natural or synthetic. Salts are flavorants that enhance a salty taste. Sugars and other sweeteners
are flavorants that enhance a sweet taste.

                                                    4
[0021] Illustrative but non-limiting examples of flavors, or taste components, that can be used in
the flavored mouthguards described herein include a sweet flavor, a tart flavor, a salty flavor, a
citrus flavor such as orange or lemon, a berry flavor such as strawberry, a mint flavor such as
peppermint, spearmint, and the like. Other flavorants include cinnamon. It will be appreciated
that flavorants can be combined in order to provide additional taste combinations. Two or more
flavorants can be combined into a single polymer layer, or the flavorants can be separated, one
in each polymer layer. In some embodiments, flavorants are disposed in separate layers to be
deployed in targeted areas of the mouth. For example, a flavorant that is sweet, such as
sucralose, is optionally deployed in layer toward a front region of the mouth while a different
type of flavorant, such as a citrus flavorant, is optionally deployed in layer toward a back region
of the mouth.
[0022] A variety of flavorants can be used, including GRAS (generally regarded as safe) natural
and artificial flavorants. In some embodiments, particular flavorants can be selected not only to
provide a desired flavor or aroma, but also to accommodate the thermal processing parameters
involved in molding a particular polymer. Some flavorants are disposed within water soluble
carriers or oil soluble carriers. It will be appreciated that in some instances, a flavorant in an oil
soluble carrier may have an increased affinity for the polymer to which the flavorant is added.
[0023] In some embodiments, the flavorants include one or more flavorants that can provide a
sweet taste, or sweetness. A variety of different sweeteners can be used, including GRAS natural
and artificial sweeteners. The sweetness-providing flavorants can be selected not only to provide
a desired sweetness, but also in accordance with the thermal processing parameters of the
polymer to which the sweetener is to be added.
[0024] Illustrative but non-limiting examples of suitable sweeteners include sugar alcohols such
as sorbitol, maltitol, xylitol, mannitol, erythritol, and lactitol. Additional suitable sweeteners
include saccharin, sucralose, and extracts from the Stevia plant. The sweetener can be added in
any desired concentration and can be added to the polymer in any suitable form, such as a liquid
or a powder that can be mixed into a liquid polymer prior to molding. In some embodiments, the
sweetener can be added at a concentration of about 0.5 to about 20 weight percent of the
polymer. It will be appreciated that the desired concentration level can vary, depending on the
particular sweetener being used, the desired taste effect, and the specific polymer to which the
sweetener is being added.

                                                  5
[0025] The flavorant can be added in any desired concentration. In some embodiments,
flavorants providing tastes other than sweet can be added at a concentration of about 3 to about
30 weight percent of the polymer. In some embodiments, flavorants providing sweetness can be
added at a concentration of about 0.5 to about 20 weight percent of the polymer. It will be
appreciated that the desired concentration level can vary, depending on the particular flavorant
being used, the desired taste effect, and the specific polymer the flavorant is being added to. In
some embodiments, the flavorant can be added to the polymer when making a master batch
pellet that can subsequently be used when molding the mouthguard 200.
[0026] In some embodiments, the flavorants such as flavor oils or powders can be mixed into a
container of pellets that do not already include any flavorants. As a result of mixing, the pellets
become coated with the flavorants and at least some of the flavorants can absorb into the pellets.
The pellets are added to the injection molding machine in which friction and pressure melts and
blends the material as it flows through the injection molding machine.
[0027] Turning to the Figures, FIG. 1 illustrates the environment in which a mouthguard 200 is
used. A mouthguard user has a mouth 10, generally including a rigid upper jaw 12 and a
movable lower jaw 42 which are movably coupled at a temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The
rigid upper jaw 12 has gum tissue 14 within mouth 10. Gum tissue 14, as well as the bone
thereunder, support anterior teeth (incisors and canines) 18 which have incisal or biting surfaces.
The gum tissue 14 and the bone thereunder also support posterior teeth (molars and bicuspids)
22 which have cusps and biting surfaces 26. The movable lower jaw 42 supports a bone covered
by gum tissue 44 which further supports anterior teeth (incisors and canines) 46 and posterior
teeth (molars and bicuspids) 48 with occlusal surfaces 49.
[0028] FIGS. 2 through 8 provide illustrative but non-limiting views of the components that
together form the illustrative mouthguard 200. In some embodiments, as illustrated, the
mouthguard 200 is formed a step at a time, as subsequent polymeric layers or structures are
combined. Generally, the mouthguard 200 includes a mouthguard base 300 formed of a first
material, an elastomeric frame 400 formed of a second material, and a liner 500 formed of a
third material. While the mouthguard base 300 is described as being formed of a first material,
the elastomeric frame 400 is described as being formed of a second material and the liner 500 is
described as being formed of a third material, it will be appreciated that first, second and third

                                                   6
merely denote materials, and do not necessarily denote the order in which the mouthguard 200 is
formed, or the order in which the individual layers are formed or combined.
[0029] In some embodiments, a mouthguard may only be formed of two materials, such as an
outer frame formed of a first material and an inner gel that is disposed within the outer frame.
The outer frame can include a flavorant and the inner gel can include a flavorant that provides
sweetness. In some embodiments, the inner gel can include two or more flavorants, including a
flavorant that provides sweetness. In some embodiments, the outer frame can include two or
more flavorants, including a flavorant that provides sweetness. In some embodiments, the outer
frame can include a flavorant providing sweetness and the inner gel can include a flavorant that
provides a particular flavor.
[0030] In some embodiments, the mouthguard 200 can be considered as being a "boil and bite"
mouthguard 200. Before use of the mouthguard 200, a user must fit the mouthguard 200 in their
mouth. To do this, the mouthguard 200 is momentarily submersed into boiling water for 16-60
seconds. This will cause the liner 500 to soften without appreciably softening the mouthguard
base 300. Thereafter, the mouthguard apparatus 200 is immediately placed onto the teeth 18 and
22 of the upper jaw 12 (FIG. 1). The U-shaped mouthguard base 300 will cover the posterior
teeth of the upper jaw up, including the third molar. The user bites down firmly and applies
suction between the upper jaw 12 and the mouthguard 200 while packing the mouthguard 200
with the hands along the cheeks and gums adjacent the anterior and posterior teeth 18 and 22 of
the upper jaw 12 (FIG. 1). The posterior teeth 48 of the lower jaw 42 will properly index upon
the bottom surface of the mouthguard base 300.
[0031] The third material of the liner 500 softens at a temperature in the range of about 100 to
about 150 degrees Fahrenheit, and the first material of the mouthguard base 300 softens at a
temperature that is in the range of about 140 to about 200 degrees Fahrenheit. When the
mouthguard 200 is placed in the boiling water, the liner 500 will become softer than the
mouthguard base 300. The liner 500 will easily conform to all of the contours of the teeth while
the mouthguard base 300 is not appreciably deformed, except to conform somewhat to the outer
dimensions of the teeth and gums. The fitting process causes displacement of the liner 500
around the individual teeth, allowing the liner to conform to the exact tooth shape, unlike
standard mouthguards which only conform to the outside of the teeth. Since the third material is
in the form of a liner 500 rather than filling the U-shaped base, the amount of third material that

                                                   7
squirts out is kept to a minimum. As the mouthguard 200 cools, the liner 500 remains softer than
the mouthguard base 300, retains the fit of the user's teeth. Because of this close fit, the
mouthguard 200 will be retained and the wearer will have fewer tendencies to chew on it.
Furthermore, as a user chews on the soft third material, the third material is less likely to
crumble in a user's mouth.
[0032] FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate the elastomeric frame 400, FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate the
mouthguard base 300 in combination with the elastomeric frame 400, and FIGS. 6 through 8
illustrate the mouthguard base 300 in combination with the elastomeric frame 400 and the liner
500. In some embodiments, the mouthguard 200 can be formed by molding the mouthguard
base 300 around a previously formed elastomeric frame 400, followed by molding the liner 500
onto the combination of the mouthguard base 300 and the elastomeric frame 400.
[0033] With reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, the elastomeric frame 400 includes an impact shield
portion 410 that is located at an anterior portion 420 of the elastomeric frame 400. The
elastomeric frame 400 also includes a first plurality of cushion pads 430 that extend from a first
side 440 of a posterior portion 450 of the elastomeric frame 400 and a second plurality of
cushion pads 432 that extend from a second side 442 of the elastomeric frame 400. It will be
appreciated that the shape and pattern of the elastomeric frame 400 is illustrative only. In some
embodiments, the cushion pads 430, 432 can have other patterns and shapes. In some
embodiments, the cushion pads 430, 432 can be distinct from the impact shield portion 410. In
some embodiments, the cushion pads 430, 432 help assure proper fitting of the mouthguard 200
when softened by preventing the user from biting too deeply into the materials forming the
mouthguard base 300 and/or the liner 500. In some embodiments, the cushion pads 430, 432 are
elastomeric, which means that they can deform and return to their original shape in order to help
absorb energy when the mouthguard 200 is subjected to an impact force.
[0034] In some embodiments, as illustrated, the elastomeric frame 400 includes a wall portion
460 that forms the impact shield portion 410 and extends posteriorly along the first side 440 and
the second side 442. In some embodiments, as illustrated, the cushion pads 430, 432 are spaced
apart from the wall portion 460 in order to align the cushion pads 430, 432 within the
mouthguard 200 such that the cushion pads 430, 432 align with the desired teeth. In some
embodiments, as illustrated, the wall portion 460 includes a plurality of apertures 462. The
apertures 462, if included, can contribute to the visual appearance of the mouthguard 200. In

                                                   8
some embodiments, the apertures 462 can aid in securing together different portions of the
mouthguard 200.
[0035] In some embodiments, the mouthguard 200 can be configured to include a tether that can
be used by the player to attach the mouthguard 200 to a helmet. The tether can be permanently
attached, or the tether can be removable and insertable by the player. As illustrated in FIG. 3, in
some embodiments the elastomeric frame 400 includes a tether mouth 470 that extends from the
anterior portion 420 of the mouthguard 200.
[0036] As noted, in some embodiments of the mouthguard 200, the elastomeric frame 400 is
formed of a second material that can include one or more flavorants. In some embodiments, the
one or more flavorants include a flavorant that provides sweetness. The second material can be a
non-softening, resilient, low compression elastomer which, unlike copolymers of ethylene and
vinyl acetate (i.e., EVA), exhibits a high resilience, low compression, shape maintenance, and
shock absorption attenuation and dissipation. Virtually all rubbers that exhibit these physical
characteristics may be used for the elastomeric frame 400, including vulcanized rubber.
[0037] In some embodiments, the second material is a composite of a copolymer of ethylene
and vinyl acetate, such as the ElvaxTM resins commercially available from Ashland Chemical
Company, and an elastomeric material such as thermoplastic rubber or vulcanized rubber. In
some embodiments, the second material includes about 50 percent to about 80 percent by weight
of the elastomeric material and about 20 percent to about 50 percent by weight of the copolymer
of ethylene and vinyl acetate. In some embodiments, the copolymer can include vinyl acetate in
the range of about 18 percent to about 28 percent by weight.
[0038] An illustrative but non-limiting example of a suitable second material is thermoplastic
rubber marketed under the trademark KRATON TM, which is marketed by GLS Plastics of 740B
Industrial Drive, Cary, Ill. 60013. This thermoplastic rubber is unique in that it is injection
moldable, FDA approved and readily adheres with copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate.
Furthermore, the thermoplastic rubber has a melting or softening point significantly higher than
that of EVA. Consequently, the elastomeric frame 400 is initially molded or formed after which
the mouthguard base 300 may be injection molded therearound.
[0039] FIGS. 4 and 5 show the mouthguard base 300 molded about the elastomeric frame 400
with optional a tether mouth 470. The mouthguard base 300 is U-shaped and has an inner wall

                                                  9
310 and an outer wall 320 forming an upper channel 330 between the inner wall 310 and the
outer wall 320 for receiving the jaw and teeth 12, 18, and 22 (see FIG. 1). The mouthguard base
300 has an anterior portion 340 and a posterior portion 342. In some embodiments, as
illustrated, the material forming the mouthguard base 300 fills in and around the cushion pads
430, 432. In some embodiments, as illustrated, the cushion pads 430, 432 extend through the
mouthguard base 300 and terminate at a lower surface 332 of the upper channel 330.
[0040] In some embodiments, the inner wall 310 and the outer wall 320 each have a uniform
thickness as they extend upward from the upper channel 330. In some cases, this helps to
minimize any tendency of the walls 310, 320 to sag together and bond during the fitting process.
In some embodiments, the walls 310, 320 extend along the wall portion 460 of the elastomeric
frame 400 and terminate along an upper edge thereof. In some embodiments, the outer wall 320
extends into the plurality of apertures 462 formed within the wall portion 460.
[0041] In some embodiments, the mouthguard base 300 is made of a first material of a
softenable thermoplastic that can include one or more flavorants, including a flavorant that
provides sweetness. The first material, in one embodiment, includes copolymers of ethylene and
vinyl acetate, such as ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). In another embodiment, the mouthguard
base 300 is formed of a first material which is a copolymer having vinyl acetate in the range of
18% to 25% by weight. A commercial copolymer suitable for use is ElvaxTM resin marketed by
the GP Division of Ashland Chemical Co. In some embodiments, resins including ElvaxTM
Resin 350 through 450 have the desired proportions of vinyl acetate.
[0042] FIGS. 6, 7, and 8 show a mouthguard 200 having a liner 500 molded about the
mouthguard base 300 and the elastomeric frame 400 with optional a tether mouth 470. The liner
500 is molded along the inner wall 310 and the outer wall 320 and extends across a bottom of
the U-shaped channel 330, forming a receiving channel 510 that is adapted to engage the teeth
of the upper jaw (FIG. 1). The receiving channel 510 includes an inner wall 520 and an outer
wall 530. The liner 500, in one embodiment, has a constant thickness which is slightly thinner
than the inner wall 310 and outer wall 320 of the mouthguard base 300. For example, the
thickness of the liner 500 can be about 0.040 inches and the thickness of the walls 310, 320 can
be about 0.060 inches.

                                                  10
[0043] The liner 500 is formed of a third material which softens at a temperature lower than the
softening temperature of the first material and is softer than the first material when hardened.
The third material can include one or more flavorants, including a flavorant that provides
sweetness. In one embodiment, the third material is 100 percent of a copolymer of ethylene and
vinyl acetate, and has at least 33 percent of vinyl acetate by weight. In yet another embodiment,
the third material includes a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate, and has at least 40 percent
of vinyl acetate by weight. For example, a suitable third material is a soft EVA 40.
Alternatively, another suitable third material includes EVA 100.
[0044] As discussed, the mouthguard base 300 includes a first material, the elastomeric frame
400 includes a second material and the liner 500 includes a third material. Each of the first
material, the second material and the third material can independently include one or more
flavorants, including a sweetener, a flavorant that provides sweetness such as sucralose. Each of
the first material, the second material, and the third material can independently be free of
flavorants.
[0045] In one embodiment, the first material, and hence the mouthguard base 300, can include a
flavorant that provides sweetness. The second material, and hence the elastomeric frame 400,
can include a flavorant providing a particular taste in order to help camouflage a "plastic smell"
that could otherwise emanate or otherwise be tasted. The third material, and hence the liner 500,
can include one or more flavorants.
[0046] As an illustrative but non-limiting example, a mouthguard formed of three different
materials, such as the mouthguard 200, can have a first material can include a flavorant that
provides an orange smell and/or taste. The mouthguard can have a second material that also
includes a flavorant that provides an orange smell and/or taste. The mouthguard can have a third
material that includes a flavorant that provides an orange smell and/or taste as well as a
flavorant that provides sweetness. The orange flavor flavorants used in each of the first, second,
and third materials can be the same flavorant, or can be complementary flavorants that provide
different aspects of an "orange" taste. In some embodiments, the third material can include the
flavorant providing sweetness, but not include any other flavorants contributing to the orange
smell and/or taste.

                                                   11
[0047] It will be appreciated that the mouthguard 200 described herein is formed of three
different polymers. In some embodiments, a mouthguard may only have two different materials.
A first material can have a first flavorant while a second material has a second flavorant. One of
the materials can include two or more flavorants while the other material is free of flavorants. In
some embodiments, a mouthguard can be formed of four, five, or more different polymers, with
flavorants selectively added to one or more of the different polymers. In some embodiments, a
mouthguard can be formed of a single material such as silicone, EVA, or a formable
thermoplastic material. The single material can include one or more flavorants, and in some
cases can include a flavorant that provides sweetness.
[0048] To illustrate, a non-limiting example of a mouthguard is formed of two different
materials having a first material including a flavorant that provides a strawberry smell and/or
taste. The mouthguard also has a second material that also includes a flavorant that provides a
strawberry smell and/or taste. The strawberry flavor flavorants used in each material can be the
same flavorant or can be complementary flavorants that provide different aspects of a
"strawberry" taste. In some embodiments, the second material can also include a flavorant that
provides sweetness.
[0049] In some embodiments, one or more flavorants can be dispersed within one or more of the
polymeric materials to provide the mouthguard 200 with a flavor that is reminiscent of a fruit
punch flavor, a grape berry flavor, a mint flavor, an orange flavor, a bubblegum flavor, or a
lemon flavor.
[0050] In some embodiments, a mouthguard 650 as illustrated in the non-limiting views of
FIGS 9-10 has an initial linear or relaxed configuration as shown in FIG. 9 movable to a to a
curved or stressed configuration and retain at least part of its curved configuration as shown in
FIG. 10. The initial linear (relaxed) configuration feature is contrasted with the pre-formed U
shaped embodiments discussed above. In some embodiments, such an initial substantially linear
configuration is resultant of a thermoplastic molding process, in which mouthguard 650 is
molded from a resin into an initial, substantially linear configuration. In other embodiments, the
"relaxed" configuration may be non-linear, with a central connection element 690 that is
sufficiently flexible/resilient to be non-destructively manipulated into a substantially linear
configuration. The central connection element 690 has a lower edge 694 optionally defining a
general void that functions as a passageway for air to travel through while the mouthguard is

                                                   12
gripped between the wearer's teeth. An exemplary mouthguard similar to mouthguard 650 can
be found in the disclosure of Pub. No. US 2012/0085354, titled "MOUTHGUARD WITH
LINEAR STORAGE CONFIGURATION," which is herein incorporated by reference in its
entirety.
[0051] The mouthguard 650 includes a mouthguard body 660, a first end trough region 669, and
a second end trough region 679 that is spaced apart from the first end trough region 669 and
fixedly attached thereto by a central connection element 690. In use, the mouthguard 650 may
be placed into a user's mouth so that at least some of the user's teeth rest within the first and
second trough regions, 669 and 679 respectively, as defined by the teeth receiving trays, 670 and
680, exterior sidewalls, 673 and 683, and interior sidewalls, 676 and 686. Teeth receiving trays
670, 680 may be configured for cooperation with any desired number of teeth, and may be
spaced apart by the central connection element 690 to a desired extent to engage with any set of
teeth appropriate for a given application. In some embodiments, the first and second interior
sidewalls, 676 and 686, each possess a cutaway section, 677 and 687 respectively. In some
embodiments, the mouthguard body 660 or a component, such as the first end trough region
669, second end trough region 679, or central connection element 690, independently includes
one or more flavorants or other additives.
[0052] In some embodiments, portions of the mouthguard that come into contact with biting
areas of a wearer's teeth, such as liner 610, are softenable and formable while other portions of
the mouthguard, such as a base layer 612, including an inner surface that comes into contact
with outer surfaces of a wearer's teeth or the wearer's braces, is less softenable and formable. In
some embodiments, the first and/or second trays 670, 680 may include upper and lower troughs
or regions that are simultaneously cooperative with both maxillary and mandibular teeth, and
may be fabricated from one or more materials providing a desired degree of flexibility. In some
embodiments, the liner layer 610 is made of a material similar to that of liner 500. In some
embodiments, the base layer 612 is made of a material similar to that of base 300 and/or
elastomeric frame 400.     Similar to embodiments described above, the liner layer 610 and/or the
base layer 612 each independently includes one or more flavorants or other additives.
[0053] FIGS. 11 and 12 show non-limiting views of a mouthguard 700, according to some
embodiments. As shown in the perspective view of FIG. 11, the mouthguard 700 includes a
frame 710 having an upper inner wall 712, an upper outer wall 714, and an upper channel floor

                                                  13
716 extending between the upper inner wall 712 and the upper outer wall 714. In some
embodiments, the frame 710 forms an upper channel 722 having a U-shaped cross-sectional
profile. The upper channel floor 716 extends from a first end point 718 to a second end point
720. An upper moldable material 724 lines the upper channel 722 and provides the mouthguard
700 with the ability to be fitted to a wearer via a boil and bite process as noted above.
[0054] FIG. 12 shows the bottom view of the mouthguard 700 according to some embodiments.
As shown, the mouthguard 700 has a lower channel floor 742, a lower outer wall 714, and a
lower inner wall 718 defining a lower channel 732. A lower moldable material 722, similar to
upper moldable material 724, is formed on the lower channel floor 742 to form a bite pad. In
some embodiments, the lower moldable material 722 is an extension of upper moldable material
724 which has flowed through an opening in the channel floors 716 and 742. The lower channel
floor 742 includes one or more lower open regions 734 where the lower moldable material 722
is not formed.
[0055] Similar to embodiments previously described, the mouthguard 700 includes two or more
materials - for example, the frame 710 is formed of a first material and the moldable material
724 is formed of a second material, according to some embodiments. The first material can
have a first flavorant while a second material has a second flavorant, for example. Although
some embodiments include two materials, the mouthguard 700 can be formed of any number of
layers with any number of materials having different flavorants, such as three, four, five, or
more polymeric materials that are arranged in a corresponding number of layers and each
including one or more different flavorants.
[0056] It is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative, and not
restrictive. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading
and understanding the above description. For example, it is contemplated that features described
in association with one embodiment are optionally employed in addition or as an alternative to
features described in associate with another embodiment. The scope of the invention should,
therefore, be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of
equivalents to which such claims are entitled.
