Description of the Related Art
        [0003]      The Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway is essential in many biological
processes. It regulates the fate of as-yet undeveloped cells in embryo form. The Wnt/
catenin signaling pathway is essential to stem cell self-renewal and proliferation as well
as the development of stem cells in adult organisms (e.g. skin cell, bone cell, liver cell,
etc.) [Science (2002), 296(5573), 1644-1646]. The Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway
                                              1

  WO 2012/024404                                                        PCT/US2011/048086
regulates development, morphology, proliferation, motility and cell fate [Annual Review
of Cell and Developmental Biology (2004), 20, 781-810]. The Wnt/%-catenin signaling
pathway has a central role in tumorigenesis and inappropriate activation of this system is
observed in several human cancers ["Wnt Signaling in Human Cancer", in Signal
Transduction in Cancer (pp. 169-187). (2006) Springer].           Wnt/0-catenin was first
described in humans as a protein which interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of E
cadherin and with       Wnt/0-catenin, anchoring the cadherin      complex to the actin
cytoskeleton [Science (1991), 254(5036), 1359-1361]. Then, an additional role for
mammalian Wnt/0-catenin was discovered; namely, as the key mediator of Wnt/0-catenin
messaging.
         [0004]     In the presence of a Wnt ligand, if not inhibited by secreted
antagonists, the Wnt ligand binds a frizzled (Fzd)/low density lipoprotein receptor related
protein (LRP) complex,        activating the cytoplasmic protein dishevelled (Dsh in
Drosophila and Dvl in vertebrates). Precisely how Dsh/Dvl is activated is not fully
understood, but phosphorylation by casein kinase 1 (CK1) and casein kinase 2 (CK2)
have been suggested to be partly responsible [Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences of the USA (1999), 96(22), 12548-12552]. Dsh/Dvl then inhibits the activity of
the multiprotein complex (0-catenin-Axin-adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-glycogen
synthase kinase (GSK)-30), which targets 0-catenin by phosphorylation for degradation
by the proteasome. Dsh/Dvl is suggested to bind CK1 and thereby inhibiting priming of
0-catenin and indirectly preventing GSK-30 phosphorylation of 0-catenin [Genes &
Development (2002), 16(9), 1066-1076]. Upon Wnt stimulation, Dvl has also been
shown to recruit GSK-3 binding protein (GBP) to the multiprotein complex. GBP might
titrate GSK-30 from Axin and in this way inhibits phosphorylation of 0-catenin. Finally,
sequestration of Axin at the cell membrane by LRP has been described [Molecular cell
(2001), 7(4), 801-809]. The overall result is accumulation of cytosolic 0-catenin.
Stabilized 0-catenin will then translocate into the nucleus and bind to members of the T
cell factor (Tcf)/Lymphoid enhancing factor (Lef) family of DNA binding proteins
leading to transcription of Wnt target genes.
         [0005]     In the absence of a Wnt ligand, Axin recruits CK1 to the multiprotein
complex causing priming of 0-catenin and initiation of the 0-catenin phosphorylation
                                              2

 WO 2012/024404                                                         PCT/US2011/048086
cascade performed by GSK-30. Phosphorylated 0-catenin is then recognized by 0
transducin repeat-containing protein (0-TrCP) and degraded by the proteasome, reducing
the level of cytosolic 0-catenin.
         [0006]      Aberrant activation of the Wnt/0-catenin pathway has led to several
phenotypes, including the development of a variety of human cancers, and diseases
leading to abnormal development and functioning of the stem cells [Oncogene (2009),
28(21), 2163-2172; Cancer Cell (2008), 14(6), 471-484; American Journal of Pathology
(2003), 162(5), 1495-1502]. Chronic activation of the Wnt/0-catenin signaling pathway
has been implicated in the development of a variety of human malignancies, including
high    bone    mass   syndrome,   sclerosteosis,  colorectal  carcinomas,    hepatocellular
carcinomas (HCCs), ovarian, uterine, pancreatic carcinomas, and melanomas [BioEssays
(1999) 21(12), 1021-1030; Cell (2000), 103(2), 311-320; Genes Dev. (2000), 14(15),
1837-1851]. Since the Wnt/0-catenin pathway is involved in myriad growth and
development processes, mutation of the proteins involved in the Wnt/0-catenin signal
transduction system is closely correlated with various human diseases such as
abnormalities in development, hair follicle morphogenesis, stem cell differentiation, bone
formation and cell proliferation.
         Hair Loss
         [0007]      Hair forms in a pouch-like structure below the skin called a hair
follicle. Visible hair, for example that seen on a human scalp, is actually the hair shaft,
which is keratinized, hardened tissue that grows from the hair follicle. In particular, the
hair shaft is composed largely of keratin, which is produced by keratinocytes.
         [0008]     Normal hair follicles cycle between a growth stage (anagen), a
degenerative stage (catagen), and a resting stage (telogen). Scalp hairs have a relatively
long life cycle: the anagen stage ranges from 2 to 6 years, the catagen stage ranges from a
few days to a few weeks, and the telogen stage is approximately three months. Shorter
hairs found elsewhere on the human body have corresponding shorter anagen durations.
The morphology of the hair and the hair follicle change dramatically over the course of
the life cycle of the hair [Dermatology in General Medicine (Vol. I), McGraw-Hill, Inc.,
1993, pp. 290-91; Sperling, L. C.; J. Amer. Acad. Dermatology (1991), 25(1, Part 1), 1
17].
                                              3

 WO 2012/024404                                                             PCT/US2011/048086
         [0009]      During anagen, the hair follicle is highly active metabolically. The
follicle comprises a dermal papilla at the base of the follicle; and epidermal matrix cells
surrounding the dermal papilla form the base of the hair shaft, which extends upwards
from the papilla through the hair canal. The matrix cells are the actively growing portion
of the hair.
         [0010]      At catagen, the matrix cells retract from the papilla, and other
degenerative changes occur. For example, the vessels and capillaries supplying blood and
nutrients to the hair follicle shrivel and stop functioning. A column of epithelial cells
pushes the keratinized proximal shaft of the hair upwards, and cell death occurs within
the follicle. The hair shaft is then shed from the scalp or other part of the body and the
hair follicle enters telogen, the resting stage of the hair growth cycle.
         [0011]      Although hair follicle regulation and growth are not well understood,
they represent      dynamic    processes    of proliferation,   differentiation, and   cellular
interactions during tissue morphogenesis. It is believed that hair follicles are formed only
in the early stages of development and are not replaced. Thus, an increase in damaged or
non-functioning hair follicles is generally associated with hair loss.
         [0012]      Male or female pattern baldness requires the presence of male or
female hormones, e.g. androgens, but the cause is unknown. The extent of hair loss in any
male greatly depends on the genes he inherits from his father, mother, or both. Hair loss
begins at the temples or at the top of the head. If male pattern hair loss begins in the mid
teens, subsequent hair loss is usually fairly extensive. Male balding goes in waves. Hair
loss may begin in the early 20's, then stop, only to start again in a few years. By the age
of 20 to 30 years, 30% of men have bald spots. This continues to rise until age 50-60,
when 50% of men are completely bald.
         [0013]      The rate of hair loss is affected by advancing age, the tendency to bald
early   due to     inherited   genes,   and    an overabundance      of the male     hormone
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) within the hair follicle. DHT acts on a hormone receptor
within the hair follicle, and thereby slows hair production and produces weak, shorter
hair. Sometimes DHT production even stops hair growth completely. Although balding
men have above average amounts of DHT in their hair follicles, they usually do not have
above average circulating testosterone levels.

 WO 2012/024404                                                          PCT/US2011/048086
         [0014]      Female pattern baldness is not as common as male pattern baldness,
but is on the rise. It is confined to the hair predominantly at the top of the head and
complete baldness is rare in females.
         [0015]      Toxic alopecia is temporary but typically lasts three to four months,
and often is caused by an infectious disease. For example, toxic alopecia may occur as a
result   of    hypothyroidism,    diabetes,  hormonal    problems,   vitamin    deficiencies,
hypopituitarism, parasites, poor digestion, early stage of syphilis, vitamin A or retinoid
overdoses, or other cytotoxic drugs.
         [0016]      Alopecia areata is a sudden hair loss in demarcated areas. It can affect
any hairy area, but most frequently affects the scalp and beard. Hair loss confined to a
few areas is often reversed in a few months even without treatment but recurrence is a
possibility. Alopecia areata usually occurs in people with no obvious skin disease or
systemic disease, but in rare cases lab tests may show anti-microsomal antibodies to
thyroglobulin, gastric parietal cells and adrenal cells.
         [0017]      Scarring alopecia results from inflammation and tissue destruction. It
may be due to injuries such as burns, physical trauma, or destruction after x-rays. In these
cases, little regrowth is expected. Other causes are cutaneous lupus erythematosus, lichen
planus, chronic deep bacterial or fungal infections, deep ulcers, sarcoidosis, syphilis, or
tuberculosis. Slow growing tumors of the scalp are a rare cause of hair loss.
         [0018]      While none of these conditions is very well understood, each condition
is distressing because hair is often considered an important factor in human social
communications and interactions.
         [0019]     Numerous approaches have been suggested for treating hair loss. Two
of the most commonly used and accepted compounds for preventing hair loss are
minoxidil, the active ingredient in Rogaine@ and the 5a-reductase inhibitor, finasteride,
the active ingredient in Propecia@. However, cosmetic treatment of age-related hair loss
in patients with topical solution of minoxidil or finasteride has resulted in only moderate
regrowth of hair in less than 40% of such patients. Indeed, less than ten percent of the
men who use Rogaine@ achieve satisfactory results. Thus, there is a need in the art for
more effective methods of, and compositions for treating hair loss. Preferably, new
methods and compositions will require fewer applications of active ingredients; provide
                                               5

 WO 2012/024404                                                           PCT/US2011/048086
hair regrowth sooner, in more abundance, and thicker, than presently observed with
minoxidil or finasteride treatment.
         [0020]     It has been found that hair follicle development and regeneration are
regulated by the canonical Wnt/0-catenin signaling pathway [Investigative Dermatology
(2008), 128(5), 1081-1087]. In the epidermis, hair follicle development is initiated when
mesenchymal cells populate the skin. During this process, signals emanating from the
dermis induce epithelium thickening, elongation of the epithelial cells, and the formation
of placodes containing Wnt-responsive cells. In response, placodes signal dermal cells to
condense, thereby forming the dermal papilla component of the hair follicle, which is
also responsive to Wnt signaling. Wnt3a is secreted from hair epithelium and acts in an
autocrine and paracrine fashion, and it has been demonstrated that Wnt-3a maintains
anagen gene expression in dermal papilla cells and mediates hair-inductive activity in an
organ culture. This Wnt-3a-mediated hair growth might depend on the canonical Wnt/3
catenin signaling pathway because deletion of -catenin or the Lef1 gene resulted in hair
loss in mice. Therefore, activation of P-catenin by Wnt contributes to the inhibition of
keratinocytes differentiation, induction of hair follicle formation, and maintenance of
proliferation of neuronal progenitors.
        Neurodegenerative Diseases
         [0021]     Neurodegenerative diseases result from deterioration of neurons or
their myelin sheath which over time will lead to dysfunction and disabilities resulting
from this. Adult mammalian brain has limited capacity for regeneration. This makes the
repair of any injuries hazardous and, consequently, CNS traumas are devastating.
         [0022]     New neurons are generated from neural stem cells, in two regions of
the adult mammalian central nervous system: the subventricular zone of the lateral
ventricle, and the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus [Current Opinion in
Cell Biology (2001), 13, 666-672]. Signals provided by the microenvironment contribute
to the regulation of the maintenance, proliferation and neuronal fate commitment of the
local stem cells. Many of these signals and signaling pathways are unknown.
         [0023]     Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia that
gradually destroys neurons and affects more than 24 million people worldwide. It occurs
mostly in older adults and patients afflicted with AD lose their ability to learn, remember,
                                              6

 WO 2012/024404                                                           PCT/US2011/048086
make decisions, communicate and carry out daily activities. The etiology and progression
of AD is not well understood, but is associated with amyloid beta (AP) plaques and
neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.
         [0024]      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the central
nervous system affecting more than 6 million people worldwide and that often impairs
the sufferer's motor skills and speech. The symptoms of Parkinson's disease result from
the loss of dopamine-secreting cells in the region of the substantia nigra (literally "black
substance"). These neurons project to the striatum and their loss leads to alterations in the
activity of the neural circuits within the basal ganglia that regulate movement.
         [0025]      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative
disease that results from the death of motor neurons. A progressive loss of muscle control
impairs the individual's capacity for independent function. ALS strikes the cells in the
brain and spinal cord (motor neurons), which send signals to move muscles. In some
cases, a mutation in the SODI gene results in a dysfunctional protein, the superoxide
dismutase protein (called SOD1), which normally "cleans" up toxic particles inside a cell.
When SODl is mutated, toxic particles accumulate inside motor neurons causing them to
malfunction. But this mutation only explains a few percent of cases of ALS. The primary
cause of ALS, which afflicts about 350,000 adults worldwide, is unknown.
         [0026]      Stroke and traumatic brain injury can also cause neuronal loss and lead
to cognitive decline. Stroke can be classified into two major categories: ischemic and
hemorrhagic. Ischemia is due to interruption of the blood supply, while hemorrhage is
due to rupture of a blood vessel or an abnormal vascular structure. Stroke can cause
permanent neurological damage, complications and death if not promptly diagnosed and
treated. It is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in
the United States and Europe.
         [0027]      Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) accounts for 18% of dementias in
people under 65 years old. It frequently manifests itself as a behavioral disturbance, and
can progress to impair an individual's capacity for independent thought and function.
Recent studies have uncovered genetic factors that contribute to this dementia; however
no treatment yet exists to block the brain deterioration it causes.

         [0028]     Wnt/j-catenin signal transduction system plays a crucial role in the
differentiation and development of nerve cells for the central nervous system, suggesting
a relationship between Wnt/-catenin proteins and the incidence of various diseases of the
central nervous system, including neurodegenerative diseases [Nature (2005), 437(7063),
1370-1375]. Particularly, it is also found that Wnt/-catenin signaling is related to
diseases resulting from the abnormality of nerve cells, such as brain damage, Parkinson's
disease, Amyotrophic      Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease),          stroke, epilepsy,
Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.
         [0029]     Alzheimer's    disease     is     the    most     common        age-related
neurodegenerative disorder. In fact, a relationship between amyloid-3-peptide (A3)
induced neurotoxicity and a decrease in the cytoplasmic levels of -catenin has been
observed. Apparently AP binds to the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of the Frizzled
receptor (Fz) inhibiting Wnt/-catenin signaling. Cross-talk with other signaling cascades
that regulate Wnt/-catenin signaling, including the activation of M1 muscarinic receptor
and PKC, the use of Ibuprofen-ChE bi-functional compounds, PPAR a, y agonists,
nicotine and some antioxidants, results in neuroprotection against A3. These studies
indicate that a sustained loss of Wnt signaling function may be involved in the A3
dependent neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer's brain. Thus, the activation of the
Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway could be proposed as a therapeutic target for the
treatment of AD.
         Eye Diseases
         [0030]     Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is a medical condition
which usually affects older adults that results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual
field (the macula) because of damage to the retina. It occurs in "dry" and "wet" forms. It
is a major cause of visual impairment in older adults (>50 years). The inner layer of the
eye is the retina, which contains nerves that communicate sight, and behind the retina is
the choroid, which contains the blood supply to the macula (the central part of the retina).
In the dry (nonexudative) form, cellular debris called drusen accumulate between the
retina and the choroid, and the retina can become detached. In the wet (exudative) form,
which is more severe, blood vessels grow up from the choroid behind the retina, and the
                                              8

retina can also become detached. It can be treated with laser coagulation, and with
medication that stops and sometimes reverses the growth of blood vessels.
        [0031]      Diabetic retinopathy is retinopathy (damage to the retina) caused by
complications of diabetes mellitus, which can eventually lead to blindness. It is an ocular
manifestation of systemic disease which affects up to 80% of all patients who have had
diabetes for 10 years or more. As new blood vessels form at the back of the eye as a part
of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), they can bleed (hemorrhage) and blur vision.
Some people develop a condition called macular edema. It occurs when the damaged
blood vessels leak fluid and lipids onto the macula, the part of the retina that lets us see
detail. As the disease progresses, severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy enters an
advanced, or proliferative, stage. The lack of oxygen in the retina causes fragile, new,
blood vessels to grow along the retina and in the clear, gel-like vitreous humour that fills
the inside of the eye. Without timely treatment, these new blood vessels can bleed, cloud
vision, and destroy the retina.
        [0032]      Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of genetic eye conditions. In the
progression of symptoms for RP, night blindness generally precedes tunnel vision by
years or even decades. Many people with RP do not become legally blind until their 40s
or 50s and retain some sight all their lives [American Journalof Ophthalmology (2003),
136(4), 678-68]. Others go completely blind from RP, in some cases as early as
childhood. Progression of RP is different in each case. RP is a type of progressive retinal
dystrophy, a group of inherited disorders in which abnormalities of the photoreceptors
(rods and cones) or the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the retina lead to progressive
visual loss. Affected individuals first experience defective dark adaptation or nyctalopia
(night blindness), followed by reduction of the peripheral visual field (known as tunnel
vision) and, sometimes, loss of central vision late in the course of the disease.
        [0033]      M6ler glia, or Miller cells, are glial cells found in the vertebrate
retina, which normally serve the functions of any normal glial cells. However, following
injury to the retina, it has been seen that M6ler glia undergo dedifferentiation into
multipotent progenitor cells. At this point, the progenitor cell can divide and differentiate
into a number of retinal cell types, including photoreceptors, that may have been
damaged during injury. Additionally, recently published research has shown that M6ler

cells act as a light collector in the mammalian eye, analogous to a fiber optic plate,
funneling light to the rod and cone cells.
         [0034]      Multipotent retinal progenitors must solve two fundamental problems.
First, they must initially expand their numbers but later limit their proliferation so that the
right number of differentiated cells is produced at the appropriate developmental time.
Second, the distinct processes of division and differentiation must be coordinated so that
differentiation can be initiated when cells stop dividing [Current Opinion in Genetics &

Wnt promotes cell proliferation in multiple tissues [Cell and Tissue Research (2008),
331(1), 193-210], in particular in the developing retina [Stem Cells (2008), 26(8), 2063
2074; Development (2003), 130(3), 587-598; Development (2005), 132(12), 2759-2770;
Development (2005), 132(13), 3027-3043]. The SoxB1 family of genes (Soxl-3) may be
key effectors of Wnt/0-catenin signaling in the developing nervous system [Development
(2006), 133(22), 4451-4461; Neuron (2005), 46(1), 23-36]. During neurogenesis, Sox2
antagonizes proneural genes and can maintain progenitors [Nature Neuroscience (2003),
(6), 1162 - 1168; Neuron (2003), 39(5), 749-765]. In the frog retina, Wnt/0-catenin
signaling through Fz5 is necessary for Sox2 expression, which is required for proneural
gene expression and the transition from progenitors to neurons [Neuron (2005), 46(1),
23-36]. It was discovered that these factors are core components of a conserved
hierarchical cascade and propose that they form a powerful directional network that
drives cells from a proliferative, undifferentiated state to a nonproliferative, differentiated
neuronal or glial fate [Development (2009), 136(19), 3289-3299].
         [0035]      Regeneration in the mammalian CNS is severely limited. Unlike in the
chick, current models hold that retinal neurons are never regenerated. It has been
demonstrated that, in the adult mammalian retina, M6ler glia dedifferentiate and produce
retinal cells, including photoreceptors, after acute neurotoxic injury in vivo. However, the
number of newly generated retinal neurons is very limited. It has been demonstrated that
Wnt/0-catenin signaling promotes proliferation of M6ler glia-derived retinal progenitors
and neural regeneration after damage or during degeneration. Wnt3a treatment increases
proliferation of dedifferentiated M6ler glia>20-fold in the photoreceptor-damaged retina.
It has also been shown that in the degenerating retina, Wnt3a increased cell proliferation,

and treatment with RA or VPA promoted the differentiation of these cells into rhodopsin
positive photoreceptor cells [JournalofNeuroscience (2007), 27(15), 4210-4219].
        [0036]      Therefore, we propose that modulating the Wnt/0-catenin pathway is
one possible therapeutic strategy to enhance replacement of lost neurons by generating
cells derived from endogenous neuronal progenitors.
        Bone Formation
        [0037]      Canonical Wnt/0-catenin signaling has been demonstrated to increase
bone formation, and Wnt pathway components are being pursued as potential drug targets
for osteoporosis and other metabolic bone diseases [Bone (2009), 44(6), 1063-1068]. In
modern times, bone diseases are increasing due to socio-environmental and genetic
factors, particularly due to increase of population of elderly persons. Generally, bone
diseases occur and develop without special symptoms, and rapidly worsen with age.
Although many drugs have been developed for the treatment of bone diseases thus far,
most of them mainly aim to alleviate pain or to retard the decrease of bone density. They
are not effective as a curative medication which aims for increasing the bone density of
patients who suffer from osteoporosis. Some other drugs are usually in the form of
injections and are reported to produce side effects upon long-term administration thereof.
        [0038]      Signaling through the Wnt/0-catenin pathway can increase bone mass
through a number of mechanisms, including renewal of stem cells, stimulation of
preosteoblast replication, induction of osteoblastogenesis, and inhibition of osteoblast and
osteocyte apoptosis. One molecular mechanism is through the stimulation of the Wnt
pathway by Wnt-3a interaction of its receptors LRP5 and Fzd [Journal of Medicinal
Chemistry (2009), 52(22), 6962-6965].       Bone forming osteoblasts express the proteins
LRP5 and Fzd on the surface membrane, which serve as co-receptors for the soluble
peptide agonist Wnt-3a. Once stimulated with Wnt-3a, internal concentrations of free 0
catenin rise and enter the nucleus and recruit T-cell factor (TCF). Transcriptional events
follow and result in the production of additional anabolic gene products. An additional
soluble extracellular protein, Dkk-1, antagonizes this process by simultaneously binding
to the cell surface receptors Kr2 and LRP5, effectively inhibiting Wnt-3a binding to
LRP5. In addition, the Kr2/LRP5/Dkk-1         complex undergoes endocytosis to remove
LRP5 from the cell membrane, thereby nullifying its function. Loss-of-function

mutations of secreted Wnt antagonists like Dkk-1, SOST/sclerostin and secreted frizzled
related protein (sFRP)- 1 result in increased bone formation due to changes in a variety of
osteoblast parameters     like proliferation,    differentiation, recruitment/longevity  and
function [Journalof Bone and Mineral Research (2009), 21(6), 934-945], while deletion
of the 0-catenin-activated transcription factor TCF- 1 causes osteopenia that arises from a
reduction in osteoprotegerin expression by the osteoblast [Developmental Cell (2005),
8(5), 751-764].
        Intestinal Diseases
         [0039]     The adult     intestinal  epithelium is characterized    by   continuous
replacement     of epithelial   cells   through   a   stereotyped  cycle  of cell division,
differentiation, migration and exfoliation occurring during a 5-7 day crypt/villus transit
time. The putative growth factors regulating proliferation within the adult intestinal stem
cell niche have not yet been identified, although studies have implicated the cell-intrinsic
action of B-catenin/Lef/Tcf signaling within the proliferative crypt compartment.
         [0040]     A number of pathological conditions affect the cells of the intestines.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can involve either or both the small and large bowel.
Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the best-known forms of IBD, and both fall into
the category of "idiopathic" inflammatory bowel disease because the etiology for them is
unknown.      "Active" IBD is characterized by acute inflammation.         "Chronic" IBD is
characterized by architectural changes of crypt distortion and scarring. Crypt abscesses
can occur in many forms of IBD.
         [0041]     Ulcerative colitis (UC) involves the colon as a diffuse mucosal disease
with distal predominance. The rectum is virtually always involved, and additional
portions of colon may be involved extending proximally from the rectum in a continuous
pattern. The etiology for UC is unknown. Patients with prolonged UC are at increased
risk for developing colon cancer.
         [0042]     Patients with UC are also at risk for development of liver diseases
including sclerosing cholangitis and bile duct carcinoma.
         [0043]     Crohn's disease can involve any part of the GI tract, but most
frequently involves the distal small bowel and colon. Inflammation is typically
transmural and can produce anything from a small ulcer over a lymphoid follicle
                                               12

  WO 2012/024404                                                        PCT/US2011/048086
(aphthoid ulcer) to a deep fissuring ulcer to transmural scarring and chronic
inflammation. One third of cases have granulomas, and extracolonic sites such as lymph
nodes, liver, and joints may also have granulomas. The transmural inflammation leads to
the development of fistulas between loops of bowel and other structures. Inflammation is
typically segmental with involved bowel separating areas of involved bowel. The
etiology is unknown, though infectious and immunologic mechanisms have been
proposed.
        [0044]      Gluten, a common dietary protein present in wheat, barley and rye
causes a disease called Celiac disease in sensitive individuals. Ingestion of such proteins
by sensitive individuals produces flattening of the normally luxurious, rug-like, epithelial
lining of the small intestine.
        [0045]      Other clinical symptoms of Celiac disease include fatigue, chronic
diarrhea, malabsorption of nutrients, weight loss, abdominal distension, anemia, as well
as-a substantially enhanced risk for the development of osteoporosis and intestinal
malignancies such as lymphoma and carcinoma. Celiac disease is generally considered to
be an autoimmune disease and the antibodies found in the serum of the patients support
the theory that the disease is immunological in nature.
        [0046]      Transgenic mice that have a knock-out of the Tcf locus show a loss of
proliferative stem cell compartments in the small intestine during late embryogenesis
[Oncogene (2006) 25(57), 7512-7521]. However, the knockout is lethal, and so has not
been studied in adults. In chimeric transgenic mice that allow analysis of adults,
expression of constitutively active NH 2-truncated p-catenin stimulated proliferation in
small intestine crypts, although either NH 2-truncated p-catenin or Lef-1/ -catenin
fusions induced increased crypt apoptosis as well [The Journal of Cell Biology (1998),
141(3), 765-777; The Journal of Biological Chemistry (2002), 277(18), 15843-15850].
Because diverse factors regulate P-catenin/Lef/Tcf-dependent transcription, including
non-Frizzled GPCRs and PTEN/PI-3-kinase, the cause of intestinal stem cell defect is not
known. Genes expressed in the gastrointestinal tract that are controlled by Wnt/j-catenin
include CD44, and EphB2.
        Regenerative Medicine
                                             13

  WO 2012/024404                                                         PCT/US2011/048086
         [0047]      Due to the remarkable advances made in the field of medicine in
recent years, opportunities for saving lives are continuing to increase in the area of living
donor transplant techniques for tissues and organs. However, there are limitations on
treatment dependent upon living donor transplants due to such factors as a shortage of
transplant donors and the occurrence of rejection. If it were possible to regenerate a tissue
or organ that has been lost due to surgical treatment or an unforeseen accident, then it
would be possible to considerably improve the quality of life for patients. In addition,
regenerative medicine also makes it possible to resolve the problems confronting living
donor transplants. From this viewpoint, the degree of expectations being placed on
regenerative medicine is high.
         [0048]      Technologies in which regenerative medicine has been successful are
primarily related to comparatively simple tissue in terms of morphology or function in
the manner of artificial skin, artificial bone and artificial teeth. Reconstructed artificial
skin and artificial bone is incorporated into cells enabling the providing of signals
required for tissue construction. However, there have been limitations on the repertoire of
differentiation of artificial skin and artificial bone by regenerative medicine techniques.
For example, although allogeneic keratinocytes or skin fibroblasts and the like
differentiate into structures in the form of the epidermis, are incorporated by surrounding
organs to eventually have a horny layer or basal layer having barrier properties, there has
been reported to be no derivation of secondary derivatives such as hair follicles,
sebaceous glands or sweat glands.
         [0049]      Body tissue normally contains both cells that are able to self-replicate
and possess stem cell properties for maintaining tissue homeostasis by sending signals to
differentiated cells or supplying differentiated cells, and cells having properties of
somatic cells that have already differentiated that receive various signals or commands
from such cells, and is able to function through interaction between both of these types of
cells. In the case of vertebrates, for example, interaction between mesenchymal cells and
epithelial cells is essential for nearly all tissue and organ formation. In the case of hair
follicles, mesenchymal cells in the form of hair papilla cells are responsible for stem cell
like properties, while epithelial cells in the form of keratinocytes are equivalent to cells
                                                14

  WO 2012/024404                                                         PCT/US2011/048086
having somatic cell-like properties in their ability to differentiate into hair shafts (hair
itself).
         [0050]    The difficulty encountered when forming organs by regenerative
medicine lies in reaching a state of coexistence between cells having stem cell-like
properties maintained     in  an undifferentiated     state and cells that have       already
differentiated as in actual body tissue. In the prior art, even if epithelial cells and
mesenchymal cells were able to be co-cultured, they either both ended up differentiating
or both maintained an undifferentiated state, thereby preventing the reproduction of the
coexistence of undifferentiated cells and differentiated cells so as to mimic actual body
tissue.
         [0051]    Guiding multipotent cells into distinct lineages and controlling their
expansion remain fundamental challenges in developmental and stem cell biol. Members
of the Wnt pathway control many pivotal embryonic events, including self-renewal or
expansion of progenitor cells.
         [0052]    Published observations suggest that canonical Wnt signals play distinct
roles during discrete developmental windows, first positively regulating mesoderm
commitment and then possibly playing a negative role in the initial induction of cardiac
progenitors [Genes & Development (2001), 15(3), 316-327; Ibid., 304-315; Proc Natl
Acad Sci U S A. (2006), 103(52), 19812-19817; Development (Cambridge, UK) (2006),
133(19), 3787-3796]. The loss- and gain-of-function studies of canonical Wnt signaling
in a spatiotemporally restricted manner described here provide compelling evidence that
Wnt/0-catenin signaling is required in a cell autonomous fashion for the expansion and
development of precardiac mesoderm and cardiac mesoderm in mouse. Thus, narrow
developmental windows may exist during which canonical Wnt signaling sequentially
inhibits then promotes cardiac development. Thus it was shown that canonical Wnt
signaling can be manipulated to regulate expansion and differentiation of progenitor cells.
         [0053]    In contrast to progenitor cells, however, stem cells are far less specific.
The most important difference between stem cells and progenitor cells is that stem cells
can replicate indefinitely, whereas progenitor cells can only divide a limited number of
times. The term adult stem cell, also known as somatic and gametes, refers to any cell
which is found in a developed organism that has two properties: the ability to divide and
                                             15

 WO 2012/024404                                                           PCT/US2011/048086
create another cell like itself and also divide and create a cell more differentiated than
itself. They can be found in children, as well as adults [Nature (2002), 418(6893), 41
49]. All somatic cells of an individual are genetically identical in principle, they evolve a
variety of tissue-specific characteristics during the process of differentiation, through
epigenetic and regulatory alterations. Pluripotent somatic stem cells are rare and
generally small in number but can be found in a number of tissues including umbilical
cord blood. A great deal of somatic stem cell research has focused on clarifying their
capacity to divide or self-renew indefinitely and their differentiation potential. In mice,
pluripotent stem cells are directly generated from adult fibroblast cultures. Unfortunately,
many mice don't live long with stem cell organs.
         [0054]     Somatic cells can be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSC) by retroviral transduction of four transcription factors [Cell (2008), 132(4), 567
582]. While the reprogrammed pluripotent cells are thought to have great potential for
regenerative medicine [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (2008), 105(15), 5856-5861],
genomic integrations of the retroviruses, especially c-Myc, increase the risk of
tumorigenesis [Nature (2007), 448(7151), 313-317]. Generation of iPSCs for use in the
clinical setting would benefit from identification of alternative, ultimately safer, initiating
stimuli, in preference to genetic modification. This could be transient treatment with
defined factors, low-toxicity chemicals, or synthetic small molecules. Since the Wnt
pathway is intimately connected to the core circuitry of pluripotency, it has been shown
that the stimulation of the pathway using soluble Wnt3a promotes the generation of
iPSCs in the absence of c-Myc retrovirus. These data demonstrate that signal transduction
pathways and transcription factors can act coordinately to reprogram differentiated cells
to a pluripotent state [Cell Stem Cell (2008), 3(2), 132-135; Cell Stem Cell (2008), 3(5),
465-466].
         [0055]     As discussed above, activators of the Wnt/0-catenin signaling pathway
are expected to be medicaments useful against cell proliferation disorders, bone
disorders, eye diseases, Alzheimer's disease and even tissue generation. Thus, it would be
advantageous to have novel activators of the Wnt/0-catenin signaling pathway as
potential treatment regimens for Wnt/0-catenin signaling pathway-related disorders. The
instant invention is directed to these and other important ends.

                          DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
         [0085]      It has been      discovered that    P-diketones, y-diketones     and y
hydroxyketones are capable of activating the Wnt/0-catenin signaling pathway.            The
Wnt/0-catenin signaling pathway has been found to play a crucial role in the
differentiation and development of nerve cells for the central nervous system, bone
formation, hair follicle development and regeneration, and stimulation of stem cell
growth, maintenance and differentiation.
         [0086]      The present invention relates a method for increasing cell or tissue
regeneration in a vertebrate subject. The invention relates to methods for increasing the
successful activity of embryonic and/or adult stem cells, progenitor cells, mesenchymal
progenitor/stem cells, or differentiated cells in vivo in a vertebrate subject. The invention
further relates to methods for increasing cell or tissue regeneration in a vertebrate subject
by administering a compound according to Formulas I, II or III to the vertebrate subject
in need thereof, and increasing in vivo a stem cell, progenitor cell population, or
                                               22

        Hair Growth
        [0087]       Compositions comprising compounds according to Formulas I, II or III
can be used to promote hair growth.
        [0088]       "Promoting hair growth" refers to maintaining, inducing, stimulating,
accelerating, or revitalizing the germination of hair.
        [0089]       The method of the present invention is useful in the treatment of
alopecia in mammals, and as such may be used to promote, increase, or assist in the
growth of hair. Subjects may be male or female. The term alopecia refers to both the
complete absence of hair in skin which typically exhibits hair growth, as well as to a loss
or diminution in the amount of hair. Multiple types and causes of alopecia are recognized
in humans, including male pattern baldness, chemotherapy induced hair loss, congenital
alopecia, and alopecia areata. The term treating alopecia refers to both the treatment of
skin with a total absence of hair growth as well as the treatment of skin having reduced or
patchy hair growth. Successful treatment results in an increased number of hairs.
        [0090]       Subjects to be treated according to the invention include human
subjects as well as other mammalian subjects, such as dogs, cats, mice, rats, goats,
llamas, minks, seals, beavers, ermines, and sheep. These can be treated for hair loss due
or simply for enhancing wool or pelt production.
                                               23

 WO 2012/024404                                                         PCT/US2011/048086
         [0091]    "Treating alopecia" refers to (i) preventing alopecia in an animal
which may be predisposed to alopecia, (ii) inhibiting, retarding or reducing alopecia, (iii)
promoting hair growth and/or (iv) prolonging the anagen phase of the hair cycle.
         [0092]    A method for promoting hair growth in accordance with the present
invention is characterized by applying an effective amount of a compound according to
Formulas I, II or III, or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof on the skin of
mammals and in particular, on human scalp.
        Neurological Disorder
         [0093]    Compounds according to the present invention can modulate the
cellular fate of neural stem cells and promote the differentiation of these neural
precursors to functional neurons and glial cells.
         [0094]    Compositions comprising compounds according to Formulas I, II or III
can be used to treat neurodegenerative diseases.
         [0095]    Non-limiting examples of neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer's
disease, schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder, bipolar disorder or unipolar disorder,
depression, substance abuse, neurodegenerative disease, autism or autism spectrum
disorder, or a disorder resulting from neural damage such as spinal injuries or brain
injuries. The neurodegenerative disease may be for instance, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(Lou Gehrig's disease) or Parkinson's disease.
         [0096]    Other non-limiting examples of neurodegenerative diseases are eye
diseases such as age related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema or retinitis
pigmentosa.
         [0097]    The invention also provides a method for treating brain injury resulting
from traumatic injury or stroke.
         [0098]    Another aspect of the invention is a method of enhancing neural

         [00100]   In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating a
neurodegenerative    disease    in   a patient  requiring   treatment,  which   comprises
administering an effective amount of a compound of Formulas I, II or III, or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as defined hereinabove.
         [00101]   The    compounds     according   to  the present invention     may be
administered alone or co-administered with compounds working by a different
mechanism, for example neuroprotectant agents. In one embodiment, the compounds are
co-administered compounds with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (e.g. Aricept) for
Alzheimer's disease or L-DOPA for Parkinson disease.
        Bone Formation
         [00102]   Compositions comprising compounds of Formulas I, II or III can be
used to treat, prevent and alleviate bone conditions. The present invention provides a
method for (i) reducing loss of bone mass, (ii) increasing bone mass, (iii) maintaining
bone mass and/or (iv) reducing loss of calcium from bone, comprising: administering to a
subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to Formulas I, II or
III. The method could be used for treating, preventing or delaying a bone condition. The
invention further provides a method for promoting healing of bone fractures or bone
defects comprising: administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a
compound according to Formulas I, II or III. Any of the above mentioned methods can
involve the conjoint administration of an agent that increases bone mass or prevents the
loss of bone mass.
         [00103]   The invention also provides for the use of a compound according to
Formulas I, II or III as a medicament for treating, preventing or delaying a bone
condition.
         [00104]   As used herein, the term "bone condition" includes any condition
where it is desirable to increase bone mass or bone density and/or prevent the loss of
bone mass or bone density. A bone condition includes any condition that increases
osteoclast number, increases osteoclast activity, increases bone resorption, increases
marrow fibrosis, or alters the calcium content of bone.
         [00105]   Non-limiting examples of bone conditions include metabolic bone
conditions    such as renal     osteodystrophy,   primary forms    of osteoporosis    (e.g.,
                                             25

 WO 2012/024404                                                         PCT/US2011/048086
postmenopausal and senile osteoporosis), and secondary forms of osteoporosis that
develop as a result of an underlying disease state. For example, osteoporosis can develop
in patients that have endocrine disorders such as hyperparathyroidism, hypo- and
hyperthyroidism, hypogonadism, hypercalcemia due to malignancy, pituitary tumors,
type I diabetes, or Addison's disease. Neoplasias such as multiple myeloma and
carcinomatosis also can lead to development of osteoporosis. In addition, gastrointestinal
problems such as malnutrition, malabsorption, hepatic insufficiency, and vitamin C or D
deficiencies,    and   chronic   administration   of   drugs   such    as   anticoagulants,
chemotherapeutics, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants, and alcohol can lead to development
of osteoporosis.
        [00106]     Non-limiting examples of bone conditions also include osteonecrosis,
osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Paget's disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, chronic
hyperparathyroidism,     hyperthyroidism,    Gorham-Stout     disease,    McCune-Albright
syndrome, and alveolar ridge bone loss.
        [00107]     The term "bone condition" includes, without limitation, all conditions
resulting in bone loss, including, cancers and tumors (such as osteosarcoma and multiple
myeloma), renal disease (including acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, renal bone
dystrophy and renal reperfusion injury), kidney disease, premature ovarian failure and
other conditions.
        [00108]     Endocrine disorders, vitamin deficiencies and viral infections also can
lead to development of bone conditions that can be treated with methods of the invention.
An example of a bone condition caused by a nutritional disorder is osteomalacia, a
nutritional disorder caused by a deficiency of vitamin D and calcium. It is referred to as
"rickets" in children, and "osteomalacia" in adults. It is marked by a softening of the
bones (due to impaired mineralization, with excess accumulation of osteoid), pain,
tenderness, muscle wasting and weakness, anorexia, and overall weight loss. It can result
from malnutrition, repeated pregnancies and lactation (exhausting or depleting vitamin D
and calcium stores), and vitamin D resistance.
        [00109]     Bone conditions include conditions resulting from the treatment of a
subject with drugs, for example the osteopenia resulting from the treatment with
Cyclosporin A or FK506.

        [00115]     The invention also provides a method for treating a subject with a
therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to Formulas I, II or III,
wherein the subject is affected by a disease selected from arterial calcification,
ankylosing spondylitis, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, myositis
ossificans, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, calcific tendonitis, rotator cuff disease
of the shoulders, bone spurs, cartilage or ligament degeneration due to hydroxyapatite
crystal deposition, and chondrocalcinosis.
        [00116]     By the term "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount"
of a compound according to Formulas I, II or III, is meant an amount sufficient to obtain
the desired physiological effect, e.g., activation of osteoblasts, increase in osteoblast
number, increase in bone formation, a decrease in osteoclasts number or the deactivation
of osteoclasts. An effective amount of a Wnt/0-catenin signaling pathway activator is
determined by the care giver in each case on the basis of factors normally considered by
one skilled in the art to determine appropriate dosages, including the age, sex, and weight
of the subject to be treated, the condition being treated, and the severity of the medical
condition being treated.
        [00117]     The invention also provides a method for treating a subject with a
therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to Formulas I, II or III
conjointly with an agent that increases bone mass or prevents the loss of bone mass. In
one embodiment, the agent that increases bone mass is a growth factor, a mineral, a
vitamin, a hormone, a prostaglandin,          an inhibitor of 15-lipoxygenase,         a bone
morphogenic protein or another member of the TGF-beta superfamily which increases
bone formation, an ACE inhibitor, a Hedgehog protein, examethasone, calcitonin, or an
active fragment thereof. In one embodiment, the agent that prevents the loss of bone mass
is progestin, estrogen, an estrogen/progestin combinations, estrone, estriol, 17a- or 173
ethynyl estradiol, SB242784, polyphosphonates, biphosphonates or an active fragment
thereof.
        Intestinal Diseases
        [00118]     Compounds according to Formulas I, II or III are also administered for
the treatment of gastrointestinal inflammation. "Gastrointestinal inflammation" as used
herein refers to inflammation of a mucosal layer of the gastrointestinal tract, and
                                             28

  WO 2012/024404                                                          PCT/US2011/048086
encompasses      acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. Acute inflammation is
generally characterized by a short time of onset and infiltration or influx of neutrophils.
         [00119]     "Chronic gastrointestinal inflammation" refers to inflammation of the
mucosal of the gastrointestinal tract that is characterized by a relatively longer period of
onset, is long-lasting (e. g., from several days, weeks, months, or years and up to the life
of the subject), and is associated with infiltration or influx of mononuclear cells and can
be further associated with periods of spontaneous remission and spontaneous occurrence.
Thus, subjects with chronic gastrointestinal inflammation may be expected to require a
long period of supervision, observation, or care. "Chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory
conditions" (also referred to as "chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases") having
such chronic inflammation include, but are not necessarily limited to, inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD), colitis induced by environmental insults (e. g., gastrointestinal
inflammation (e. g., colitis) caused by or associated with (e. g., as a side effect) a
therapeutic regimen, such as administration of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and the
like), colitis in conditions such as chronic granulomatous disease, celiac disease, celiac
sprue (a heritable disease in which the intestinal lining is inflamed in response to the
ingestion of a protein known as gluten), food allergies, gastritis, infectious gastritis or
enterocolitis (e. g., Helicobacter pylori-infected chronic active gastritis) and other forms
of gastrointestinal inflammation caused by an infectious agent, and other like conditions.
         [00120]     As used herein, "inflammatory bowel disease" or "IBD" refers to any
of a variety of diseases characterized by inflammation of all or part of the intestines.
Examples of inflammatory bowel disease include, but are not limited to, Crohn's disease
and ulcerative colitis. Reference to IBD throughout the specification is often referred to
in the specification as exemplary of gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions, and is not
meant to be limiting.
         [00121]     Compounds according to Formulas I, II or III can be administered to a
subject prior to onset of more severe symptoms (e. g., prior to onset of an acute
inflammatory attack), or after onset of acute or chronic symptoms (e. g., after onset of an
acute inflammatory attack). As such, the agents can be administered at any time, and may
be administered at any interval. In one embodiment, compounds according to Formulas I,
II or III are administered about 8 hours, about 12 hours, about 24 hours, about 2 days,
                                              29

from at least every two weeks to every four weeks (e. g., monthly intervals) in order to
maintain the maximal desired therapeutic effect (e. g., to provide for maintenance of
relief from BD-associated symptoms).
         Regenerative Medicine
         [00123]    According to the present invention, somatic cells can be provided that
are capable as serving as a primitive organ-like structure comprised of a plurality of types
of somatic cell types.
         [00124]    Somatic cells as referred to in the present invention refer to cells that
have reached differentiation into cells that compose various organs of the body, and refer
to cells that are the opposite of undifferentiated stem cells. The present invention is
characterized by the use of two or more somatic cells, and preferably consists of various
combinations thereof, such as a combination of an epithelial cell line and mesenchymal
cells, a combination of endothelial cells and mesenchymal cells, or a combination of
epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells.
         [00125]    There are no particular limitations on organs capable of being formed
by the somatic cells as claimed in the present invention, examples of which include
various organs such as hair follicle, lung, kidney, liver, pancreas, spleen, heart,
gallbladder, small intestine, colon, large intestine, joint, bone, tooth, blood vessel, lymph
duct, cornea, cartilage, olfactory organ or auditory organ.
         [00126]    Various mammals can be used without limitation as the origin of the
cells as claimed in the present invention corresponding to the purpose thereof, examples
of which include chimpanzees, other primates, domestic animals such as dogs or cats,

 WO 2012/024404                                                            PCT/US2011/048086
farm animals such as cows, pigs, horses, sheep or goats, laboratory animals such as
rabbits, rats, mice or guinea pigs, and more preferably nude mice, SCID mice or nude
rats. In addition, although combinations thereof may be homogeneous combinations or
heterogeneous combinations, homogeneous combinations are preferable.
         [00127]    The present invention is characterized by the addition of a Wnt/j
catenin signaling pathway activator according to Formulas I, II or III to a mixture of
types of differentiated somatic cells as described above followed by culturing thereof.
Wnt signaling refers to a series of actions that demonstrate the function of transcription
factors by promoting nuclear migration of j-catenin. These signals originate from cellular
interaction that includes, for example, a series of processes in which a protein referred to
as Wnt3A secreted from certain cells further acts on other cells causing nuclear migration
of intracellular j-catenin which acts as a transcription factor. This series of processes give
rise to the initial phenomenon of organ construction in the example of epithelial
mesenchymal interaction. The Wnt/j-catenin signaling pathway is known to control cell
proliferation and differentiation, organ formation and various cell functions such as cell
migration during initial development. Although Wnt signaling is used when culturing ES
cells for the purpose of inhibiting differentiation due to their function of maintaining an
undifferentiated state, their utilization and effects during culturing of somatic cells are
completely unknown.
         [00128]    Another characteristic of the present invention is the subjecting of the
mixture of types of differentiated somatic cells, to which a compound according to
Formulas I, II or III has been added, to non-plate contact culturing. Non-plate contact
culturing refers to a method of culturing cells on an interface having a spherical surface
so as not to allow adhesion of plate-adhering cells. An example of non-plate contact
culturing is a hanging drop method. The hanging drop method refers to adhering a drop
of culture medium containing cultured cells onto the inside of the upper lid of a culture
dish, carefully closing the lid so that the culture medium does not drop or run down, and
culturing cells within the culture medium to be cultured in the form of an inverted drop
due to surface tension. As a result of culturing in this manner, the effects on the cells
attributable to contact with a flat surface as in the case of plate culturing can be
minimized. Other examples of non-plate contact culturing methods include a formation

method utilizing a semi-spherical cell culture dish that has been surface-treated in
advance to prevent cell adhesion (for example, "Spheroid" commercially available from
Sumitomo Bakelite) (referred to as the spheroid formation method), and a suspension
method in which cells are aggregated in a suspended state by culturing in a nitrocellulose
medium.
        [00129]     In some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions are provided that
are effective for treatment of a disease of an animal, e.g., a mammal, caused by the
pathological activation or mutations of the Wnt pathway. The composition includes a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a Wnt pathway activator as described herein.

         [00151]    The skilled artisan will recognize that some structures described herein
may be resonance forms or tautomers of compounds that may be fairly represented by
other chemical structures, even when kinetically, the artisan recognizes that such
structures are only a very small portion of a sample of such compound(s). Such
compounds are clearly contemplated within the scope of this invention, though such
resonance forms or tautomers are not represented herein.
         [00152]    The    compounds      provided     herein  may     encompass     various
stereochemical forms. The compounds also encompasses diastereomers as well as optical
isomers, e.g. mixtures of enantiomers including racemic mixtures, as well as individual
enantiomers and diastereomers, which arise as a consequence of structural asymmetry in
certain compounds. Separation of the individual isomers or selective synthesis of the
individual isomers is accomplished by application of various methods which are well
known to practitioners in the art.        Unless otherwise indicated, when a disclosed
compound is named or depicted by a structure without specifying the stereochemistry and
has one or more chiral centers, it is understood to represent all possible stereoisomers of
the compound.

active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary
active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. In addition, various
adjuvants such as are commonly used in the art may be included. These and other such
compounds are described in the literature, e.g., in the Merck Index, Merck & Company,
Rahway, NJ. Considerations for the inclusion of various components in pharmaceutical
compositions are described, e.g., in Gilman et al. (Eds.) (2006); Goodman and Gilman's:
The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11th Ed., The McGraw-Hill Companies.
         [00157]    The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to salts that retain
the biological effectiveness       and properties  of the compounds       of the preferred
embodiments and, which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. In many cases,
the compounds of the preferred embodiments are capable of forming acid and/or base
salts by virtue of the presence of amino and/or carboxyl groups or groups similar thereto.
Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids and
organic acids. Inorganic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example,
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the

e.g., a dog, a cat, a mouse, a rat, a cow, a sheep, a pig, a goat, a non-human primate or a
bird, e.g., a chicken, as well as any other vertebrate or invertebrate.
         [00160]     By "therapeutically effective amount" or "pharmaceutically effective
amount" is typically one which is sufficient to achieve the desired effect and may vary
according to the nature and severity of the disease condition, and the potency of the
compound. It will be appreciated that different concentrations may be employed for
prophylaxis than for treatment of an active disease. This amount can further depend upon
the patient's height, weight, sex, age and medical history.
         [00161]     A therapeutic effect relieves, to some extent, one or more of the
symptoms of the disease, and includes curing a disease. "Curing" means that the
symptoms of active disease are eliminated. However, certain long-term or permanent
effects of the disease may exist even after a cure is obtained (such as extensive tissue
damage).
         [00162]     "Treat,"   "treatment,"  or   "treating,"  as   used  herein refers  to
administering     a pharmaceutical     composition for therapeutic      purposes. The term
"therapeutic treatment" refers to administering treatment to a patient already suffering
from a disease thus causing a therapeutically beneficial effect, such as ameliorating
existing symptoms, preventing additional symptoms, ameliorating or preventing the
underlying metabolic causes of symptoms, postponing or preventing the further
development of a disorder and/or reducing the severity of symptoms that will or are
expected to develop.

        [00167]        The compounds and compositions described herein are capable of
activating the Wnt/0-catenin signaling pathway. The Wnt/0-catenin signaling pathway
has been found to play a crucial role in the differentiation and development of nerve cells
for the central nervous system, bone formation, hair follicle development and
regeneration, and stimulation of stem cell growth, maintenance and differentiation. Such
compounds and compositions are therefore expected to be useful against cell proliferation
disorders, bone disorders, Alzheimer's disease and even tissue generation.

        Compound preparation
        [00187]     The starting materials used in preparing the compounds of the
invention are known, made by known methods, or are commercially available. It will be
apparent to the skilled artisan that methods for preparing precursors and functionality
related to the compounds claimed herein are generally described in the literature. The
skilled artisan given the literature and this disclosure is well equipped to prepare any of
the compounds.
        [00188]     It is recognized that the skilled artisan in the art of organic chemistry
can readily carry out manipulations without further direction, that is, it is well within the
scope and practice of the skilled artisan to carry out these manipulations. These include
reduction of carbonyl compounds to their corresponding alcohols, oxidations, acylations,
aromatic substitutions, both electrophilic and nucleophilic, etherifications, esterification
and saponification and the like. These manipulations are discussed in standard texts such
as March'sAdvanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure 6 th Ed.,
John Wiley & Sons (2007), Carey and Sundberg, Advanced Organic Chemistry              5th Ed.,
Springer (2007), Comprehensive Organic Transformations:A Guide to FunctionalGroup

Transformations,2nd Ed., John Wiley & Sons (1999) (incorporated herein by reference in
its entirety)and the like.
         [00189]     The skilled artisan will readily appreciate that certain reactions are best
carried out when other functionality is masked or protected in the molecule, thus avoiding
any undesirable side reactions and/or increasing the yield of the reaction. Often the
skilled artisan utilizes protecting groups to accomplish such increased yields or to avoid
the undesired reactions. These reactions are found in the literature and are also well
within the scope of the skilled artisan. Examples of many of these manipulations can be

         [00247]    The compounds can be administered either alone or more typically in
combination with a conventional pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or the like. The term

0.001%-100% active ingredient, in one embodiment 0.1-95 %, in another embodiment 75
85%. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to
those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington: The Science and Practice of
Pharmacy,21st Edition (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. 2005).
        [00248]     In one preferred embodiment, the compositions will take the form of a
unit dosage form such as a pill or tablet and thus the composition may contain, along with
the active ingredient, a diluent such as lactose, sucrose, dicalcium phosphate, or the like;
a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or the like; and a binder such as starch, gum
acacia, polyvinylpyrrolidine, gelatin, cellulose, cellulose derivatives or the like.      In
another solid dosage form, a powder, marume, solution or suspension (e.g., in propylene
carbonate, vegetable oils or triglycerides) is encapsulated in a gelatin capsule. Unit
dosage forms in which the two active ingredients are physically separated are also
contemplated; e.g., capsules with granules of each drug; two-layer tablets; two
compartment gel caps, etc.
        [00249]     In another preferred embodiment, compositions described herein are
used as a drug-eluting coatings for a medical device including, but not limited to
temporary or permanent implants, sponge, polymer, or gel.
        [00250]     The implant according to an embodiment of the invention is an
orthopedic implant including, but not limited to (i) a hip joint, (ii) screws, cannulated
screws, nails, meshs, cages, wires, pins, intramedullary nails, rods, posts, anchors, and
plates intended to join or attach bone fragments, pieces, or parts with each other, (iii)

        [00251]     In some instances, a compound according to Formulas I, II or III is
administered in combination with one or more therapeutic agents, e.g., therapeutic agents
useful in the treatment of bone disorders or conditions described herein. For example,

certain second therapeutic agents can promote tissue growth or infiltration, such as
growth factors. Exemplary growth factors for this purpose include, without limitation,
epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast
growth factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factors
(TGFs), parathyroid hormone (PTH), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and insulin-like
growth factors (IGFs). Other second therapeutic agents can promote bone growth, such as
bone morphogenetic        proteins (U.S. Pat. No. 4,761,471; PCT Pub. WO 90/11366),
osteogenin (Sampath, et al., Proc. Natl. A cad. Sci. USA (1987), 84(20), 7109-7113), NaF
(Tencer, et al., Journal of Biomedical Materials Research (1989), 23(6), 571-589),
Peptide sequences such as IKVAV may be added to attach nerves and have those nerves
express neuritis (Tashiro, et al., The Journal of Biological Chemistry (1989), 264(27),
16174-16182).
        [00252]     Liquid pharmaceutically administrable compositions can, for example,
be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc. an active compound as defined above and
optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier (e.g., water, saline, aqueous dextrose,
glycerol, glycols, ethanol or the like) to form a solution or suspension. If desired, the
pharmaceutical composition can also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary
substances such as wetting agents, emulsifying agents, solubilizing agents, pH buffering
agents and the like (e.g., sodium acetate, sodium citrate, cyclodextrine derivatives,
sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine acetate, triethanolamine oleate, and the like).
Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or
suspensions, as emulsions, or in solid forms suitable for dissolution or suspension in
liquid prior to injection. The percentage of active compound contained in such parenteral
compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof, as well as the activity of
the compound and the needs of the subject. However, percentages of active ingredient of
0.0l1% to 10% in solution are employable, and will be higher if the composition is a solid,
which will be subsequently diluted to the above percentages. In some embodiments, the
composition will comprise 0.2-2% of the active agent in solution.
        [00253]     It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may also vary
with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for
any particular patient, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according
                                              63

  WO 2012/024404                                                          PCT/US2011/048086
to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or
supervising the administration of the compositions, and that the concentration ranges set
forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the
claimed compositions.
         [00254]    Solid compositions can be provided in various different types of
dosage forms, depending on the physicochemical properties of the drug, the desired
dissolution rate, cost considerations, and other criteria. In one of the embodiments, the
solid composition is a single unit. This implies that one unit dose of the drug is comprised
in a single, physically shaped solid form or article. In other words, the solid composition
is coherent, which is in contrast to a multiple unit dosage form, in which the units are
incoherent.
         [00255]    Examples of single units which may be used as dosage forms for the
solid composition include tablets, such as compressed tablets, film-like units, foil-like
units, wafers, lyophilized matrix units, and the like. In a preferred embodiment, the solid
composition is a highly porous lyophilized form. Such lyophilizates, sometimes also
called wafers or lyophilized tablets, are particularly useful for their rapid disintegration,
which also enables the rapid dissolution of the active compound.
         [00256]    On the other hand, for some applications the solid composition may
also be formed as a multiple unit dosage form as defined above. Examples of multiple
units are powders, granules, microparticles, pellets, beads, lyophilized powders, and the
like. In one embodiment, the solid composition is a lyophilized powder. Such a dispersed
lyophilized system comprises a multitude of powder particles, and due to the
lyophilization process used in the formation of the powder, each particle has an irregular,
porous microstructure through which the powder is capable of absorbing water very
rapidly, resulting in quick dissolution.
         [00257]    Another type of multiparticulate system which is also capable of
achieving rapid drug dissolution is that of powders, granules, or pellets from water
soluble excipients which are coated with the drug, so that the drug is located at the outer
surface of the individual particles. In this type of system, the water-soluble low molecular
weight excipient is useful for preparing the cores of such coated particles, which can be
subsequently coated with a coating composition comprising the drug and, preferably, one

or more additional excipients, such as a binder, a pore former, a saccharide, a sugar
alcohol, a film-forming polymer, a plasticizer, or other excipients used in pharmaceutical
coating compositions.
        [00258]    Also provided herein are kits. Typically, a kit includes one or more
compounds or compositions as described herein. In certain embodiments, a kit can
include one or more delivery systems, e.g., for delivering or administering a compound as
provided above, and directions for use of the kit (e.g., instructions for treating a patient).
In another embodiment, the kit can include a compound or composition as described
herein and a label that indicates that the contents are to be administered to a patient with
cancer. In another embodiment, the kit can include a compound or composition as
described herein and a label that indicates that the contents are to be administered to a
patient with one or more of osteoporosis and osteoarthropathy; osteogenesis imperfecta,
bone defects, bone fractures, periodontal disease, otosclerosis, wound healing,
craniofacial defects, oncolytic bone disease, traumatic brain injuries related to the
differentiation and development of the central nervous system, comprising Parkinson's
disease, strokes, ischemic cerebral disease, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, depression,
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia; eye diseases such as age related macular degeneration,
diabetic macular edema, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy or retinitis pigmentosa and
diseases related to differentiation and growth of stem cell, comprising hair loss,
hematopoiesis related diseases, tissue regeneration related diseases and other diseases
associated with abnormalities in development, stem cell differentiation and cell
proliferation.
        [00259]    The actual dose of the active compounds of the present invention
depends on the specific compound, and on the condition to be treated; the selection of the
appropriate dose is well within the knowledge of the skilled artisan.
Methods of Treatment
        [00260]    The compounds and compositions provided herein can be used as
activators of one or more members of the Wnt pathway, including one or more Wnt
proteins, and thus can be used to treat a variety of disorders and diseases in which
aberrant Wnt signaling is implicated, such as osteoporosis and osteoarthropathy;

 WO 2012/024404                                                          PCT/US2011/048086
osteogenesis imperfecta, bone defects, bone fractures, periodontal disease, otosclerosis,
wound healing, craniofacial defects, oncolytic bone disease, traumatic brain injuries
related to the differentiation and development of the central nervous system, comprising
Parkinson's disease, strokes, ischemic cerebral disease, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease,
depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia; eye diseases such as age related macular
degeneration, diabetic macular edema, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy or retinitis
pigmentosa and diseases related to differentiation and growth of stem cell, comprising
hair loss, hematopoiesis related diseases, tissue regeneration related diseases and other
diseases associated with abnormalities in development, stem cell differentiation and cell
proliferation.
         [00261]     With respect to hair loss, the canonical Wnt/0-catenin signaling
pathway is known to regulate hair follicle development and regeneration. In the
epidermis, hair follicle development is initiated when mesenchymal cells populate the
skin. During this process, signals emanating from the dermis induce epithelium
thickening, elongation of the epithelial cells, and the formation of placodes containing
Wnt-responsive cells. In response, placodes signal dermal cells to condense, thereby
forming the dermal papilla component of the hair follicle, which is also responsive to Wnt
signaling. Wnt3a is secreted from hair epithelium and acts in an autocrine and paracrine
fashion, and it has been demonstrated that Wnt-3a maintains anagen gene expression in
dermal papilla cells and mediates hair-inductive activity in an organ culture. This Wnt
3a-mediated hair growth might depend on the canonical Wnt/0-catenin signaling pathway
because deletion of -catenin or the Lef1 gene resulted in hair loss in mice. Accordingly,
the compounds and compositions described herein may be used topically to treat hair loss
by modulation of the Wnt/0-catenin signaling pathway.
         [00262]     With respect to neurodegenerative diseases, Wnt/0-catenin signal
transduction system plays a crucial role in the differentiation and development of nerve
cells for the central nervous system. Particularly, it is found that Wnt/0-catenin signaling
is related to diseases resulting from the abnormality of nerve cells.
         [00263]     More particularly in Alzheimer's disease, studies indicate that a
sustained loss of Wnt signaling function may be involved in the Ap-dependent
neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer's brain. Consequently, the compounds and
                                              66

compositions described herein may be used to reactivate lost Wnt signaling function
involved in neurodegeneration.
         [00264]     Other neurodegenerative diseases can also be treated with the
compounds and compositions described herein.
         [00265]     More particularly, neurodegenerative diseases that may be treated by
the compound, compositions and methods described herein include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         [00266]     Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), progressive
muscular atrophy (PMA), bipolar disorder, depression, strokes, ischemic cerebral disease,
epilepsy, brain damage and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1(SCA1).
         [00267]     With respect to eye diseases, Wnt/0-catenin signal transduction system
regulates the maintenance of a retinal progenitor population in the ciliary marginal zone
(CMZ), and thus function as a putative stem cell factor in the retina. Particularly, it is
found that Wnt/ catenin pathways mediate a process of retinal repair and that application
of Wnt activators may promote retinal neuron regeneration. In the setting of injury, Wnts
may serve a protective role. It has been recently shown that Wnt3a protects
photoreceptors. The results of this study may well be interpreted as an upregulation of
self-renewal of stem cells in the setting of injury.
         [00268]     Accordingly, the compounds and compositions described herein may
be used to enhance replacement of lost neurons caused by disease and protect
photoreceptors during injury by modulation of the Wnt/0-catenin signaling pathway.
         [00269]     Other eye diseases can also be treated with the compounds and
compositions described herein.
         [00270]     More particularly, eye diseases that may be treated by the compound,
compositions and methods described herein include, but are not limited to, the following:
         [00271]     Age related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, familial
exudative vitreoretinopathy and retinitis pigmentosa.
         [00272]     With respect to diseases associated with differentiation and growth of
stem cell, Wnt/0-catenin signaling is critical in the self-renewal of stem cells in many
different tissues, including the skin, intestine, brain and blood. Therefore, the compounds
                                               67

and compositions described herein may be used to treat disorders and diseases related to
abnormalities in development.
Evaluation of Biological Activity
          [00273] The biological activity of the compounds described herein can be
tested using any suitable assay known to those of skill in the art, e.g., WO 2001/053268
or WO 2005/009997. For example, the activity of a compound may be tested using one or
more of the test methods outlined below.
Example 7.
          [00274] Compounds that enhance the Wnt activity, or Activators, were assayed
as follows. Reporter cell lines were generated by stably transducing cells of cancer cell
lines (e.g., colon cancer) with a lentiviral construct that include a wnt-responsive
promoter driving expression of the firefly luciferase gene.
          [00275] Lentiviral constructs were made in which the SP5 promoter, a
promoter having eight TCF/LEF binding sites derived from the SP5 promoter, is linked
upstream of the firefly luciferase gene. The lentiviral constructs can also include a
hygromycin resistance gene as a selectable marker. The SP5 promoter construct were
used to transduce SW480 cells, a colon cancer cell line having a mutated APC gene that
generates a truncated APC protein, leading to de-regulated accumulation of 0-catenin.
          [00276] Cultured SW480 cells bearing a reporter construct can be distributed at
approximately 10,000 cells per well into 384 or 96 well multiwell plates. Compounds
from a small molecule compound library can then be added to the wells in half-log
dilutions using three or ten micromolar top concentration. A series of control wells for
each cell type received only buffer and compound solvent DMSO. Twenty-four hours
after the addition of compound, reporter activity for luciferase can be assayed, for
example, by addition of the BrightGlo luminescence reagent (Promega) and the Victor3
plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Readings are normalized to DMSO only treated cells, and
any activities above DMSO are considered activation.         Compounds are considered
activators if reporter activities are 2x fold or greater than DMSO.           EC50 is the
                                             68

concentration at half maximal activation. Table 2 shows the activity of selected
activators.
