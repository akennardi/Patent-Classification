                    Subterranean Monitoring Using Enhanced Video
                                        BACKGROUND
   [0001] The present specification was filed as a divisional application of Australian
   patent application 2014392684, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by
 5 reference.
   [0001A] The present disclosure relates to monitoring subterranean events using
   enhanced video.
   [0002] Recognizing, quantifying and otherwise identifying subterranean events present
   a perpetual challenge in engineering and in accessing subterranean resources. The
10 challenge, of course, stems from the fact that these events are under ground, and thus
   cannot be easily accessed, seen or measured. In some instances, the above-ground
   effects of subterranean events can aid in such identification. For example, an
   underground explosion, well control event, or other subterranean event might cause
   surface effects in the form of vibration or other movement of surface objects such as
15 trees, soil, equipment, or other structures. In the case of a large-magnitude
   subterranean event occurring near the surface, such surface movement (or other above
   ground effects) may be easily visible to the unaided naked eye. In other instances,
   such surface effects may be only minimally detectible, or completely below the
   threshold of detection, by the unaided naked eye. Sensors, used in a wellbore or at the
20 surface, are conventionally employed to recognize and quantify subterranean events by
   measure characteristics of the event. However, sensors typically only measure the
   characteristics only at point locations, and sensors in many existing systems must be
   placed on or in direct contact with the region or media being sensed.
                                                 1

  Thus, operators must make do with few sensors and the corresponding limited data
  produced by the sensors or bear the expense and complexity of placing,
  communicating with and maintaining a complex sensor network. Moreover, complex
  sensor networks are often infeasible in remote, inaccessible, and/or underdeveloped
5 locations.

                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 5   [0012] The concepts herein relate to monitoring subterranean events using enhanced
     video.
     [0013] Video enhancement techniques exist that can magnify the appearance of
     movement, color changes, sounds, time and other characteristics in video. In general,
     these techniques involve magnifying or exaggerating one or more characteristics of
10   video, either live or recorded, to make the characteristics more perceptible to a person
     viewing the video. The techniques can magnify characteristics that are difficult to
     perceive or not perceptible to a person viewing the characteristics in person or in the
     unenhanced video, to make them readily perceptible. The techniques can be applied to
     the entire video or to one or more specific images in the video, such as, a particular
15   surface, object, or other image in the video. One such video enhancement technique is
     Eulerian video magnification, and, for convenience of discussion, the examples herein
     will be described with respect to Eulerian video magnification. However, other
     enhancement techniques are within the concepts herein, and can be used in lieu of
     Eulerian video magnification or used in combination with Eulerian video
20   magnification.
     [0014] Eulerian video magnification involves magnifying certain aspects of a video
     that are difficult to perceive or not perceptible to a person viewing the video to make
     the aspects more readily perceptible. Eulerian video magnification can be applied to
                                                   3

   WO 2015/167537                                                                PCT/US2014/036192
     the entire video or to specified subjects (e.g., persons or things) within a video and not
     to other subjects of the video. For example, Eulerian video can be applied to images
     of a specified subject to magnify characteristics of the subject and not to other images
     adjacent the subject or in the background. In doing so, the video is broken down into
 5   several layers, including a layer for each subject with characteristics being magnified
     and a layer for images that are not being magnified. The characteristic or
     characteristics being magnified are then filtered and exaggerated, and the layers,
     including those with exaggerated characteristics, are reconstructed into an enhanced
     video. For example, movement that may be so small that it is difficult to perceive or
10   not perceptible in the unenhanced video is exaggerated in the enhanced video to be
     movement of greater magnitude that is readily perceptible. In another example, color
     changes that may be so slight that they are difficult to perceive or not perceptible in the
     unenhanced video are exaggerated in the enhanced video to be more pronounced color
     changes that are readily perceptible.
15   [0015] According to the concepts herein video enhancement is applied to video from a
     well site (including a proposed well site), either received as a recording or as a live
     feed, to magnify one or more characteristics of the video to make the characteristics
     more perceptible. The magnification can be applied to make characteristics that are
     difficult to perceive or not perceptible, either in the video or in person, readily
20   perceptible.
     [0016] In certain instances, the characteristics being magnified and monitored are
     characteristics of an event. By way of example, in an instance where the event is a
     fluid flow and the video includes images of the subject fluid flowing, characteristics
     including the movement of the fluid, the color of the fluid and/or other characteristics
                                                   4

   WO 2015/167537                                                                PCT/US2014/036192
     of the fluid itself can be magnified and monitored by Eulerian video magnification. In
     certain instances, the characteristics represent effects of an event that is remote or
     blocked (obscured) from the view of the video. Again using the example of fluid flow
     as the event, the fluid flow may manifest in effects of movement, such as vibration or
 5   expansion/contraction, of a tubing containing and obscuring the fluid flow. Thus,
     Eulerian video magnification can be applied to video including images of the tubing to
     magnify the tubing's movement. As described in more detail below, the movement of
     the tubing (i.e., an effect of the flowing fluid) can be monitored to infer characteristics
     of the fluid. In another example, in an instance where the event is subterranean fluid
10   flow through a subterranean formation, the fluid flow may manifest in effects of
     movement of the terranean surface in certain locations. Thus, Eulerian video
     magnification can be applied to video including images of the terranean surface to
     magnify the movement of the surface. As described in more detail below, the
     movement of the terranean surface (i.e., an effect of the subterranean flowing fluid)
15   can be monitored to infer characteristics of the fluid and/or the subterranean formation.
     The examples above are but a few of the possible examples within the concepts herein
     and many more examples will be described below.
     [0017] In monitoring the characteristics of an event, the enhanced video can be
     displayed to a person, and the person using the enhanced video, analyzes the video to
20   see the more perceptible characteristics. In certain instances, the person can use the
     enhanced video to identify and/or quantify (e.g. measure) the event. Alternately, the
     video can be analyzed by a computer to identify and/or quantify the event. Some or all
     of the receipt, enhancement, and analysis can be performed in real time, i.e., without
     substantial intentionally induced delay, and/or enhancement and/or analysis can be
                                                    5

   WO 2015/167537                                                           PCT/US2014/036192
     performed with delay. For example, in certain instances, the video is stored and
     enhanced and/or viewed sometime after the subterranean event has occurred. The
     enhancement can be performed on video collected using sensors optimized for the
     human visible light spectrum, or the enhancement can be performed on other types of
 5   video, including video collected using sensors optimized for non-visible spectrum
     (e.g., infrared video, X-ray, magnetic resonance, and/or other). The enhancement can
     be performed on 3-dimensional and/or stereographic video. Additional specifics and
     variations will be discussed below in connection with the following examples.
     [0018] FIG. 1A shows an example site having a system for using Eulerian video
10   magnification to identify a subterranean event 100. The system includes one or more
     motion video cameras 112 (one shown) to collect video of the site and one or more
     monitor devices 118 (one shown) to enhance the collected video to magnify one or
     more characteristics of the video using Eulerian video magnification and/or another
     technique. In FIG. 1A, the camera 112 is shown aimed to capture video of the
15   terranean surface 118 at the site, but as discussed more below, the camera can
     alternatively or additionally collect video of other things.
     [0019] Communication between the camera 112 and the monitor device 118 can be
     wired communication, wireless communication or a combination thereof. The wired
     communication can be electrical wire, fiber optic and/or other type of wire, and can be
20   a standalone system or part of one or more local area networks (LANs), wide area
     networks (WANs), all or a portion of the Internet, and/or any other communication
     system or systems at one or more locations. Example wireless communication may
     include 802.1 la/b/g/n, 802.20, WiMax, LTE, satellite, and/or any other wireless
     communications.
                                                   6

   WO 2015/167537                                                          PCT/US2014/036192
     [0020] The monitor device 118 includes a computing system 120 for receiving video
     from the cameras 112 and applying video enhancement, such as the Eulerian video
     magnification mentioned above, to the video. The computing system 120 includes a
     processor 122, a memory 124, an interface 126 and an output 128 (e.g., display), for
 5   allowing a person to interface with the computing system 120 and, in certain instance,
     allowing a person to view and analyze the video. Although FIG. 1A illustrates a single
     processor 122, memory 124, interface 126 and output 128, the computing system 120
     can be implemented using two or more such systems on the same circuit board or
     networked together. Indeed, computing system 120 may be any computer or
10   processing device such as, for example, a general-purpose personal computer (PC),
     Mac (a registered trademark of Apple, Inc.), workstation, UNIX-based workstation,
     computers other than general purpose computers, a smart phone, tablet or any other
     device.
     [0021] Although only one processor 122 is shown, multiple processors can be used.
15   The processor 122 may be a central processing unit (CPU), an application specific
     integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), or another suitable
     component. Generally, the processor 122 executes instructions, e.g., software, and
     manipulates data to perform the operations of the computing system 120.
     [0022] The memory 124, a non-transitory computer readable media, stores software to
20   operate the computing system 120. The memory 124 can include any type of memory
     or database module and may take the form of volatile and/or non-volatile memory
     including, without limitation, magnetic media, optical media, random access memory
     (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), removable media, or any other local or remote
     memory component. The memory 124 may store various objects or data, including
                                                7

   WO 2015/167537                                                               PCT/US2014/036192
     caches, classes, frameworks, applications, backup data, business objects, jobs, web
     pages, web page templates, database tables, repositories storing business and/or
     dynamic information, and any other appropriate information including any parameters,
     variables, algorithms, instructions, rules, constraints, or references thereto.
 5   [0023] The software stored by the memory 124 may include computer-readable
     instructions, firmware, wired and/or programmed hardware, or any combination
     thereof on a tangible medium (transitory or non-transitory, as appropriate) operable
     when executed to perform at least the processes and operations described herein.
     Indeed, each software component may be fully or partially written or described in any
10   appropriate computer language including C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, assembler, Perl,
     any suitable version of 4GL, as well as others. While portions of the software
     illustrated in FIG. 1A are shown as individual modules that implement the various
     features and functionality through various objects, methods, or other processes, the
     software may instead include a number of sub-modules, third-party services,
15   components, libraries, and such, as appropriate. Conversely, the features and
     functionality of various components can be combined into single components as
     appropriate.
     [0024] In operation, the camera 112 is operated to collect video. The collected video
     is relayed to the monitor device 118. In certain instances the video is relayed to the
20   monitor device 118 in real time. In other instances, the camera 112 stores (i.e., records)
     the collected video locally, for example, in a memory of the camera 112 or in a nearby
     memory. The stored video is then relayed from the storage location to the monitor
     device 118, when or if desired.
                                                   8

   WO 2015/167537                                                               PCT/US2014/036192
     [0025] The video received at the monitor device 118 is enhanced using the computing
     system 120. The computing system 120 is operated to apply a video enhancement
     technique to the video to magnify one or more characteristics of the video. In certain
     instances, the video enhancement is Eulerian video magnification or Eulerian video
 5   magnification combined with another video enhancement technique. The video
     enhancement can be applied to the entire video or to one or more subjects (i.e.,
     specified images) within the video. For example, applying video enhancement to the
     image of the terranean surface 108 in the video collected by camera 112, and not to
     remaining images in the video, facilitates viewing effects of a subterranean event
10   manifest on the terranean surface 108. In another example, applying video
     enhancement to the images of things at or above the surface 108 (e.g., surface-based
     equipment) in the video collected by camera 112, and not to remaining images in the
     video, facilitates viewing effects of an effect manifest on the surface-based equipment.
     The characteristics enhanced by the video enhancement can be different for different
15   images in the same video, and video enhancement can be applied to enhance more than
     one characteristic of a given image. In the example of enhancing video of the terranean
     surface 108, the effects may manifest as movement of the terranean surface 108.
     Therefore, the enhancement is applied to magnify movement of the terranean surface
      108. In the example of enhancing the image of the surface-based equipment collected
20   by camera 112, the effects may manifest as movement (e.g., vibrations, expansion
     and/or other movement) and temperature changes that affect the color (e.g., infrared
     light intensity or similar changes in spectral color, brightness) of the surface-based
     equipment. Therefore, the enhancement can be applied to magnify both movement
     and color changes of the surface-based equipment. In an example of video having
25   images of multiple different subjects (e.g., both the terranean surface 108 and surface
                                                  9

   WO 2015/167537                                                                 PCT/US2014/036192
     based equipment), it may be desirable to enhance the video to magnify different
     aspects of different subjects, e.g., magnifying only movement of one subject, only
     color of another subject and/or movement and color of yet another subject. Many
     examples exist and are within the concepts herein. Additional detail and examples are
 5   discussed below.
     [0026] The enhanced video is displayed to a person at the output 128, and the person
     viewing the output 128 can analyze the enhanced video to determine an occurrence or
     characteristics of an event. Because the enhancement magnifies characteristics that are
     not readily visible, i.e. difficult to perceive or not perceptible to a person viewing the
10   unmagnified video, the person viewing the video is able to readily perceive
     characteristics he or she could not have perceived in person or with video that has not
     been enhanced. In certain instances, the computing system 120 can analyze the
     enhanced video to determine an occurrence of an event and output an alert to a person
     via the output 128, enabling the person to review the enhanced video for further and/or
15   different analysis. The analysis, whether performed by the person alone or using the
     computing system 120, can take account of other sources of information. In certain
     instances, the other sources of information include sensors (e.g., pressure, temperature,
     chemical and/or other types of sensors), flow meters, other current and/or historical
     data (e.g., data regarding the surface-based equipment, the subterranean zone, and/or
20   other data), information from related processes, and/or other information.
     [0027] In certain instances, a subsurface event 100 may be an earthquake or a
     subsurface nuclear or conventional blast for which information is desired for
     engineering, military, intelligence, or other purposes. The camera 112 may be installed
     at a vantage point pointed towards the surface 108 adjacent (e.g., above) the
                                                    10

   WO 2015/167537                                                                PCT/US2014/036192
     subterranean event 100. Movement of the surface 108 caused by the earthquake or by
     the shock wave of the underground blast, without enhanced video, would be difficult
     to visually perceive or would be not visually perceptible. However, by applying
     Eulerian video magnification, the surface movement is more perceptible. Viewing the
 5   surface movement can provide information regarding the timing, magnitude, location,
     and other characteristics of the subterranean event 100.
     [0028] In certain instances, movement of existing surface features 101a - such as
     rocks, soil or vegetation - may provide sufficient variation in the image so as allow a
     subterranean event 100 to be monitored or characterized. Indeed, in certain instances,
10   subterranean events may be monitored where the surface location is remote from the
     camera, without the necessity of installing sensors or anything else at the surface 108.
     This may be an advantage where the surface location is in an inaccessible or hazardous
     area. For example, where the subterranean event 100 is an underground blast, the
     location on the surface 108 adjacent (e.g., above) the subsurface blast may be unsafe,
15   be in hostile territory, or otherwise inaccessible, but that inaccessible location may be
     viewable from a more accessible vantage point (such as a nearby ridge, aircraft, drone,
     or satellite).
     [0029] In certain instances, features to facilitate viewing effects caused by a
     subterranean event 100 can be added to the terranean surface 108. For example, FIG.
20    lB shows the terranean surface 108 including a surface marker 101b, placed in an area
     above a subsurface event 100. Like above, the surface marker 101b is shown as a
     roundel, but other surface markers could be used. FIG. IC shows the terranean surface
      108 including a plurality of upstanding markers 101c, here shown as flags. Like
     above, other upstanding markers could be used. The markers 101b, 101c can be

     placed at discrete locations on the terranean surface 108, in a closely spaced array,
     and/or in another manner. The shape, size, materials, and locations used for the
     markers can be selected so as to maximize their visible movement in response to a
     subterranean event 100 and the visibility of that movement to the cameras 112. In the
 5   example shown in FIG. IC, the subterranean event 100 is a subterranean fracture
     initiated via a fracing well 102, but subterranean event 100 could be any other
     subterranean event which could cause movement at the surface 108. The flags 10lc
     may quiver or shake slightly in response to the movement, and such quivering or
     shaking may be more readily detectible.
10   [0030] In the context of exploration and well planning, and for other purposes,
     cameras 112 and enhanced video can be used in seismic surveying. In seismic
     surveying, a seismic source device is used to induce seismic signals (e.g., vibrations)
     into the Earth (including the subterranean zone 114) and the propagation of the
     subterranean seismic signals through the Earth is interpreted to determine
15   characteristics of the Earth. The propagation of subterranean seismic signals manifests
     effects of movement on the terranean surface 108 that, without enhanced video, would
     be difficult to visually perceive or would be not visually perceptible. Video of the
     terranean surface 108 from the camera 112 is enhanced to exaggerate the movement of
     the terranean surface 108 to make the movement readily, visually perceptible.
20   Markers, such as those described above, can be used to facilitate viewing the
     movement. For example, using a closely spaced array of upstanding markers (e.g.,
     flags) can more clearly show the progression of movement induced by the seismic
     signal across the terranean surface 108. The enhanced video can be used in lieu of or
     to supplement surface and subterranean seismic sensors, to measure the magnitude,

     location, and direction of movement of the subterranean seismic signal through the
     Earth. This information can then be used to characterize the subterranean zone 114
     and other subterranean aspects.
     [0031] Referring to FIG. 2, an example well site is shown. The example well site is
 5   shown with a well 102, having a wellbore 104 extending into the Earth to one or more
     subterranean zones 114 (one shown) from a well head 106 at a terranean surface 108.
     A flow line 110, for injection and/or production, is shown coupled with a string 116
     extending into the subterranean zone 114. In the context of production, the string 116
     is a production string to transport fluids to the wellhead 106 and the flow line 110 is a
10   production line to transport fluids away from the well 102. In the context of injection,
     the string 116 is an injection string and the flow line 110 is an injection line for
     injecting production or treatment fluids (e.g., water in the context of water flood
     injection, steam in the context of steam injection, fracture fluid in the context of
     fracture treatment, acid in the context of acidizing, completion fluid in the context of
15   completion, cement in the context of cementing, and/or other fluids). FIG. 3 shows an
     example well site as the well 102 is being drilled. Thus, instead of a
     production/injection string 116 extending into the wellbore 104, a drill string 116 is
     provided. Flow line 110 in this context is a drilling fluid circulation line. In either
     instance, FIG. 2 or FIG.3, the well site can include additional equipment, including
20   gauges 111 and other equipment 113. Many different types of equipment 113 can be
     provided at the well site including pumps, compressors, valves, gauges, sensors, pump
     systems including pump trucks, engines, blenders, drilling fluid filtration systems,
     fluid treatment systems, liquid-liquid and liquid-gas separators, well treatment fluid
     systems including those for fracing, acidizing, completion and/or other treatment, fluid

      storage and lines, and other equipment used in drilling, producing, injecting or
     performing a treatment on the well.
      [0032] In the examples of FIGS. 2 and 3, a video camera 112a is provided above
      ground, i.e., outside of the well 102 and not underground, aimed to take video of the
 5   terranean surface 108. The camera 1 12a can take video of the terranean surface 108
      around the well 102 (e.g., the drilling pad and a specified distance from the pad),
     multiple wells and the surface between the wells and/or of another location, including
      of a terranean surface 108 where one or more wells are proposed but not yet drilled.
     The video of the terranean surface 108 can encompass anything on the terranean
10    surface 108, including surface equipment and worker activity on the surface 108. The
     camera 112a can rest on the terranean surface 108 or be supported off the terranean
      surface 108 at a specified vantage point. The camera 112a may be located away from
     the well to survey the well site and surrounding land. The camera 1 12a may be
      elevated so as to see the ground surface and not just the horizontal plane of the surface.
15   In certain instances, the camera 112a may be mobile carried by a drone or aircraft
      flying over the well site. The aircraft may be a fixed wing propeller driven, fixed wing
     jet engine driven, a multi-rotor helicopter drone, or balloon type drone. Also,
      although shown as a land based well 102, in a subsea well, the camera 112a could be
      aimed to take video of the sea floor (i.e., the underwater terranean surface 108). In
20   certain instances, the camera 1 12a may be on a vessel or underwater craft, such as
      submarine or an underwater remote operated vehicle (i.e., ROV). Another video
     camera 112b is provided above-ground, outside of the well, aimed to take video of the
      exterior of surface-based equipment associated with the well 102 and/or well site. In
     the present example, the video camera 112b is shown aimed to take video of the
                                                    14

   WO 2015/167537                                                              PCT/US2014/036192
     exterior of the wellhead 106, flow line 110, gauges 111 (e.g., pressure and/or
     temperature gauges) and other equipment 113 of a land based well 102. In other
     instances, the camera 112b or another camera could be aimed at other equipment
     associated with the well 102 or well site, including those discussed above.
 5   Additionally, in the context of a subsea well, the camera 112b could be aimed to take
     video of the exterior of surface-based equipment that are on the sea floor, in the riser to
     the water surface and/or on the rig, vessel or other location outside of the well 102.
     The surface based equipment may additionally include one or more transparent
     windows or openings to allow the camera 112b to view the fluids inside the
10   equipment. Yet another video camera 112c is provided below ground, in the wellbore
      104, to take subterranean video. In certain instances, the camera 1 12c is aimed to take
     video of aspects in the wellbore 104, outside of a well string 116 or drill string 116,
     including the exterior of the string 116 itself, the wellbore wall (cased or open hole)
     and/or fluids or solids in the annulus between the string 116 and wellbore 104. In
15   certain instances, the camera 1 12c is aimed to take video of aspects in the string 116.
     [0033] Fewer or more video cameras can be provided. For example, in certain
     instances, only one or only two of the cameras 1 12a-c is provided. One or more of the
     cameras 1 12a-c and/or additional cameras can be aimed at different subjects than those
     described above. In certain instances, more than one camera can be provided aimed at
20   the same subject, for example, aimed to provide different views from different
     perspectives and/or different views of different locations on the subject. In certain
     instances, one camera can be aimed to take video of multiple subjects. In certain
     instances, one or more cameras can be aimable, for example, in response to a remote
     signal or moved by a person, to enable the camera's aim to change. For example,
                                                  15

   WO 2015/167537                                                              PCT/US2014/036192
     aimable cameras enable taking video of one subject for a period of time, then taking
     video of a different subject. In some examples, one or more cameras can be carried or
     worn by a user, rather than stationary. In certain instances, one or more of the cameras
      112a-c can be isolated from ground movement, for example, supported on a fluid
 5   mount and/or in another manner.
     [0034] The video cameras 112a-c are in communication with a monitor device 118 at
     the well site or remote from the well site. The monitor device 118 can be dedicated to
     the one well site, receiving video from only the one well site, or the monitor device
      118 can receive video from multiple well sites. In certain instances, the monitor
10   device 118 is in a building or mobile vehicle or trailer. In certain instances, the
     monitor device 118 is carried or worn by a user.
     [0035] In certain instances, the surface-based equipment can include features to
     facilitate viewing events and effects caused by an event. Although described with
     respect to tubing, any of the surface-based equipment can include these features. For
15   example, FIG. 4 shows a tubing 300, such as flow line 110 or another tubing
     associated with the well, having a shape feature 302 of specified characteristics
     selected to make movement in the tubing 300 more apparent. Here the shape feature
     302 is shown as a U-shaped bend in the tubing, but in other instances the feature 302
     could be a loop, curve or other shape, and the shape feature could be applied to other
20   surfaced-based equipment than tubing. In certain instances, the shape feature 302
     could be a whistle, Helmholtz resonator, and/or other device adapted to vibrate or
     produce an acoustic signal in response to fluid flow. US Patent Publication
     2012/0146805, entitled "Systems and Methods for Well Monitoring," published June
      14, 2012, discloses a number of suitable devices. Additionally, the concepts herein
                                                 16

   WO 2015/167537                                                               PCT/US2014/036192
     could be used in concert with a system as described in this publication. In certain
     instances, the shape feature 302 can be tuned to produce a specified response in
     response to the event or effect being monitored. For example, the shape feature 302
     can be tuned to move in a specified manner as fluid is passed through it, expand in a
 5   specified manner in response to temperature, and/or produce another specified
     response.
     [0036] FIG. 4B shows a tubing 400 having a surface marker 402a that, in this instance,
     is a roundel applied to the exterior of the tubing 400. Other surface markers 402a,
     such as dots, X-shapes, and/or others could be used. FIG. 4C shows tubing 400 with
10   an upstanding marker 402b that is an upstanding flag extending outward from the
     tubing 400. Other upstanding markers 402b, such as upstanding panels, blades,
     cantilevered beam, pendulum and/or other markers could be used. In certain instances,
     the upstanding markers 402b are sensitive to movement so that they amplify or
     exaggerate movement, e.g., having a flexible shaft. Also, although only one marker
15   402a, 402b is shown in each instance above, two or more markers (of the same or
     different type) could be used. In certain instances, the surface-based equipment can
     additionally or alternatively be supplied with high visibility, bright color coatings (e.g.,
     paint, stickers and/or other), reflective coatings, strain and/or temperature sensitive
     coatings that change color in response to strain or temperature to make strain or
20   temperature change more apparent, and/or other types of coatings.
     [0037] In addition to, or as an alternative to, using cameras like camera 112 in the
     seismic surveying, camera-based ground monitoring devices can be used. FIGS. 6A
     6C show an example ground monitoring device 600, having an external housing 602
     containing a camera 604 aimed at a target 608. The target 608 is supported on a
                                                   17

   WO 2015/167537                                                                PCT/US2014/036192
     movement sensitive base 610, such as an elevated table, pendulum or other mechanical
     device that is sensitive to, and in certain instances magnifies, movement. The target
     608 can take many forms. FIG. 6B shows a roundel. In certain instances, the target
     608 is a ball in a fluid (e.g., oil and/or other fluid) filled chamber. The interior of the
 5   housing 602 may be illuminated by a light (e.g. light emitting diode) to illuminate the
     target 608. In use, the camera-based ground monitoring devices 600 are placed at least
     partially in the ground at various locations along the terranean surface 108, for
     example, in a grid, specified pattern and/or another arrangement. The devices 600 are
     linked to communicate with the monitor (e.g. monitor device 118) via a wired or
10   wireless communication. Movement at the terranean surface 108 by the seismic signal
     causes the target 608 to move and the camera 604 views the movement. The image of
     the moving target 608 is then enhanced to exaggerate the movement, making
     movement readily perceptible that, without enhanced video, would be difficult to
     perceive or not perceptible. As above, the camera-based ground monitoring devices
15   600 can be used alone, together with the surface 108 cameras described above, and/or
     surface and subterranean seismic sensors to measure the magnitude and progression of
     the subterranean seismic signal through the earth. This information can then be used to
     characterize the subterranean zone 114 and other subterranean aspects.
     [0038] In the context of drilling, cameras, including camera 11 2b, and enhanced video
20   may be used to monitor for effects of a drilling related event manifest as movement
     (e.g., vibration and/or expansion/contraction) of the drill string 116, the blow out
     preventor 106, the mud returns line (e.g., flow line 110) and/or other equipment 113
     that would otherwise be difficult to perceive or not perceptible. For example, a
     subterranean gas kick encountered by the drilling will cause an increased pressure in
                                                    18

   WO 2015/167537                                                                   PCT/US2014/036192
     the drill string 116, the wellhead 106, the mud returns line 110 and/or other equipment
      113. The increased pressure will produce an effect such as certain movements that,
     especially in the early stages of the kick, are difficult to perceive or not perceptible. In
     many instances, once the effects of the gas kick are readily perceptible without
 5   enhanced video, it is too late to react. With enhanced video, the movement manifest
     by the gas kick is readily perceptible; and therefore, can be monitored to identify and
     quantify the magnitude of coming gas kicks, and in certain instances, identify coming
     gas kicks in the early stages of the kick with time to react. Certain movement
     signatures of one or more concurrent or sequenced movements can be empirically or
10   otherwise determined and associated with the movement of the drill string 116, the
     wellhead 106, the mud returns line 110 and/or other equipment 113 caused by gas
     kicks. In addition to relying on the judgment of a person viewing the enhanced video,
     identifying the presence or sequence of these movement signatures from the enhanced
     video can be used to identify and quantify the gas kicks.
15   [0039] Increased bit whirl due to changes in the rock of the subterranean zone 114,
     drilling bit wear, or potential sticking of the drill bit or drill string will manifest effects
     on the drilling string 116 at the surface. The effects can include certain movement or
     changes in movement of the drilling string 116 that is difficult to perceive or not
     perceptible. With enhanced video, the movement is readily perceptible; and therefore,
20   can be monitored to identify and quantify these drilling problems. As above,
     movement signatures can be determined for these events and used in identifying and
     quantifying the events.

     wellbore 104, for example, by in-well telemetry devices and carried in the mud cause

     the pressure of the drilling mud (i.e., fluid) to change. The pressure changes of the
     pulses manifest effects on the drilling string 116, the blow out preventor 106, the mud
     returns line 110 and/or other equipment 113 at the surface. The effects can include
     movement in equipment that is difficult to perceive or not perceptible. For example, in
 5   certain instances, the pressure pulses manifest as traveling waves of diametric
     enlargement of cylindrical flow conduits. The pressure pulses, themselves, are not
     perceptible without direct connection of pressure or flow monitors on the flow lines.
     Although the use of such sensors is common practice, in certain instances, it is
     desirable to minimize the number of connections into or on the flow lines. In addition,
10   in certain instances, it is desirable to monitor the pressure pulses at a plurality of
     locations in order to carry out array processing of the signals so as to improve the
     signal to noise ratio. With enhanced video, the movement manifest by the pressure
     pulses of the fluid pulse telemetry signals are readily perceptible; and therefore, can be
     monitored to identify and decode the fluid pulse telemetry signals. For example, by
15   observing the movement of the surface equipment caused by the pressure changes of
     the pulses, the duration, timing and magnitude of the pressure pulses can be
     determined and movement signatures for the telemetry signals can be determined and
     used to identify and decode the telemetry signals. The duration, timing and/or
     magnitude derived from the enhanced video can be digitized and decoded much in the
20   same way that information from a pressure sensor would be decoded to provide the
     underlying communication. Moreover, noise in the signals, such as caused by
     reflections and other vibratory sources, will be more apparent and more readily
     filtered.

     [0041] FIG. 5A shows a section of cylindrical tubing 500, part of the plumbing at the
     Earth's surface used to convey drilling fluid to a mud pipe. This section of tubing 500
     has markers 502 attached to it. The markers 502 are shown as flags, but could be
     another type of marker. As the diameter of the tubing 500 expands and contracts due
 5   to changes in and propagation of the pressure pulses, the markers 502 change location,
     and in certain instances, orientation. Movement of the markers 502 can therefore be
     used to track the passage of pressure pulses through the pipe. Each marker 502
     essentially serves as an indicator of pressure at the point at which the marker is
     applied.
10   [0042] In certain instances, for length considerations, multiple, spaced-apart sections
     of markers 502 can be used and monitored to facilitate identifying wave propagation.
     Stated differently, it is not necessary for the markers 502 to be applied continuously
     along all of the surface tubing 500. Each of the markers 502 are a form of pressure
     transducer. Applying the markers 502 to flexible hoses can facilitate identifying wave
15   propagation, because the wave speed in such hoses is on the order of one tenth of the
     wave speed in normal pipe. An example of such a hose (which will be called a "flex
     hose" hereafter) is a Kelly hose, which is connected between the standpipe of a rig and
     the swivel. The wave speed in normal pipe is about 4,300 feet/second, depending on
     the pipe inner diameter, thickness and Young's modulus, and depending on the
20   compressibility of the drilling mud. In normal pipe, a 100 ms fluid pulse will span
     430 feet, while in a flex hose, it will span on the order of 43 feet. A 30 Hz carrier
     wave in normal pipe will have a wavelength of about 143 feet, while it is expected to
     be on the order of 14 feet in a flex hose.

     [0043] An example procedure for processing a video so as to extract fluid pulse
     telemetry signals is shown in FIG. 5B. At operation 504, signal processing begins by
     first identifying a fixed point on each of the markers at a time when no pressure
     fluctuations are present in the flow lines. It should be noted that it is not strictly
 5   necessary to use markers attached to the surface of the equipment, as suitable reference
     points on the equipment can be selected by reviewing a representative Eulerian video.
     At operation 506, when pressure fluctuations are present and it is desired to detect
     fluid pressure pulse signals, video is recorded. The video can be streamed to a digital
     signal processor or computer. At operation 508, under automatic control by a signal
10   processor or computer, portions around the markers are selected for further processing.
     In certain instances, if there are m markers, these will be used to produce m video
     streams (sub videos). At operation 510, the sub videos are enhanced using Eulerian
     video magnification, identifying the marker positions over time. At operation 512,
     conventional or hereinafter developed signal processing techniques are used to identify
15   the location of each marker of the m sub videos over time. In certain instances, the
     marker locations can be analyzed once per frame, although other time scales can be
     used. These are then converted into m data streams.       For example, the displacement
     of a marker from its reference position (i.e. the position the marker was recorded to be
     at when there was no pulsations present) can serve as a signal value. At operation 514,
20   the m data streams are then processed using standard or hereinafter developed digital
     signal processing techniques to separate waves propagating from downhole in the well
     from waves that are propagating to downhole and produce a signal component that
     dominantly contains waves propagating from downhole. Note that the more markers
     are tracked, the larger the number of reflections can be removed from the signals. At

     [0044] In the context of fluid monitoring and/or control, for drilling, treatment,
     production, injection, and/or other purposes at the well site, cameras, including the
 5   camera 112b, and enhanced video can be used to monitor for effects of a fluid event
     manifest in movement (e.g., vibration and/or expansion/contraction) of surface-based
     equipment, including the production/injection string, the wellhead 106, the flow line
      110, and/or other equipment 113 that would otherwise be difficult to perceive or not
     perceptible. For example, fluid flow through the surface-based equipment will cause
10   movement of the equipment that is difficult to perceive or not perceptible. Further,
     different fluid properties, such as density, solids content, gas content, pressure,
     temperature will cause different movement of the equipment. With enhanced video,
     the movement manifest by the fluid is readily perceptible; and therefore, can be
     monitored to identify the presence of fluid flow and flow rates. Additionally, fluid
15   properties can be identified from the movement, including fluid density, solids content,
     gas content, fluid pressure and temperature. As above, movement signatures can be
     used to identify and quantify these events. In certain instances, the gas/liquid ratios
     (e.g., gas to oil ratios), water content, the type of multi-phase flow and other
     characteristics of the fluid can be determined with the enhanced video. As above,
20   movement signatures for these fluid characteristics can be determined and used to
     identify and quantify these characteristics.
     [0045] As above, fluid pulse telemetry from within the wellbore 104, for example, by
     in-well telemetry devices and carried in the well fluids can be monitored to identify
     and decode the telemetry signals using the enhanced video. Also or alternatively,
                                                    23

     acoustic telemetry, for example, communications encoded as acoustic vibrations in the
     material of equipment, can be monitored to identify and decode the telemetry signals
     using enhanced video in a process similar to that of FIG. 5B. The acoustic vibrations
     manifest as movement in equipment that is difficult to perceive or not perceptible.
 5   With enhanced video, the movement manifest by the vibration of the acoustic
     telemetry signals are readily perceptible; and therefore, can be monitored to identify
     and decode the acoustic telemetry signals.
     [0046] In certain instances the cameras, including the camera 112b, can be a thermal
     imaging camera and/or used with a thermal imaging camera and the thermal video
10   enhanced to monitor effects of temperature of the fluids (drilling, production, injection
     and/or other fluids) on the surface-based equipment. Temperature responsive coatings
     could alternatively or additionally be used with a camera operating in the visual
     spectrum in identifying temperature changes. Such monitoring can identify
     temperature changes of the fluids that would be difficult to perceive or not perceptible
15   with unenhanced thermal video. Additionally, different characteristics of fluid flowing
     through the surface-based equipment, such as fluid flow rates, composition,
     gas/water/oil content, multiphase flow, the formation of hydrates, and other
     characteristics, will manifest in different temperatures. As with the movement
     signatures, temperature signatures for different fluid characteristics can be determined
20   and used to identify and quantify the characteristics. For example, monitoring
     temperature could facilitate monitoring for gas flow, water cut, multiphase flow or
     other dynamic changes to the flow.
     [0047] In certain instances cameras, including the camera 1 12b, can be aimed to view
     and enhanced video can be used to monitor gauges 111 outside of the well, including
                                                   24

   WO 2015/167537                                                              PCT/US2014/036192
     pressure, temperature and/or other types of gauges. In certain instances, the gauge
     needles may move very slowly or the movement may be very slight and, as a result of
     either, may be difficult to perceive or not perceptible. With enhanced video, these
     movements would be readily perceptible; and therefore, can be monitored to identify
 5   changes in the characteristics monitored by the gauges 111.
     [0048] In the context of monitoring the surface-based equipment itself, cameras,
     including the camera 112b, and enhanced video may be used to monitor for effects of
     events manifest as movement of the well string 116, the wellhead 106, the flow line
      100/110 and/or other equipment that would be otherwise difficult to perceive or not
10   perceptible. For example, a blockage in the internal flow passages through the surface
     based equipment will cause an increased pressure in the fluid flow, manifest as
     movement (e.g. expansion) of the well string 116, the wellhead 106, the flow line 110
     and/or other equipment that is difficult to perceive or not perceptible. In certain
     instances, blockages may also cause temperature differences on the equipment that,
15   even with thermal video, are difficult to perceive or not perceptible. The blockage
     could be caused by debris buildup, hydrate formation (especially in subsea equipment)
     slugs of different density fluid, and/or other causes. With enhanced video (visible
     spectrum and/or thermal imaging), the movement and/or temperature effects manifest
     by the blockage are readily perceptible; and therefore, it can be monitored to identify
20   the occurrence of the blockage, identify the location in the surface-based equipment of
     the blockage, and quantify the degree of the blockage. As above, movement signatures
     can be determined for these events and used to identify and quantify the blockage.
     [0049] Flow through damaged or deficient portions of the surface-based equipment
     will manifest effects on the well string 116, the wellhead 106, the flow line 110 and/or
                                                  25

     other equipment 113 that would be otherwise difficult to perceive or not perceptible.
     For example, a pressure containing portion of the surface-based equipment, if
     corroded, will be thinned and expand to a greater degree than a portion that has not
     been corroded. Loose connections, cracks, metallurgical deficiencies and other
 5   damaged or deficient portions of the surface-based equipment will manifest in
     movement. With enhanced video, the movement manifest by flow through the
     damaged portion of the surface-based equipment is readily perceptible; and therefore
     can be monitored to identify damage, identify the location of the damage, and quantify
     the degree of the damage. As above, movement signatures can be determined for these
10   events and used to identify and quantify the damage.
     [0050] As noted above, in certain instances the surface-based equipment 113 includes
     pumps. The pumps can be used for many operations, including pumping treatment
     fluids (e.g., fracking fluids, acidizing fluids, completion fluids and/or other), pumping
     injection fluids (e.g., water, brine, CO 2 , N2 and/or other), gas lift, drilling, pumping
15   production fluids and/or for other purposes. Operation of the pump, including its drive
     and any transmission, will manifest effects on the exterior surface of the pump and/or
     in other equipment coupled to the pump, such as the well string 116, the wellhead 106,
     the flow line 110 and/or other equipment 113, for example, in the form of movement.
     The movement may be difficult to perceive or not perceptible or, if perceptible,
20   difficult to visually quantify. For example, different operating speeds or operating
     loads of the pump, cavitation or vapor lock will produce different movement. Wear,
     erosion or damage to internal components in the pump, including wear of seals and
     bearings, and to the engines or motors driving the pump will cause yet different
     movement. With enhanced video, the movement manifest by operation, wear, erosion
                                                    26

   WO 2015/167537                                                             PCT/US2014/036192
     and damage is readily perceptible; and therefore can be monitored to identify and
     quantify operation, wear, erosion and damage of the pump. In certain instances, the
     wear, erosion or damage will manifest effects before the wear, erosion or damage
     substantially affects the operation of the pump, and thus enhanced video can facilitate
 5   identifying and quantifying wear or damage before it causes a service interruption. As
     above, movement signatures can be determined for different operating conditions of
     the pump (e.g., speed and load) and for different forms of wear and damage to the
     pump and used to identify and quantify the operation and health of the pump. In one
     example, the concepts can be applied to monitoring a fracturing pump fluid end and
10   drive, e.g., the internal combustion engine and transmission driving the fluid end. In
     another example, the concepts can be applied to CO 2 or N 2 pumps and their drivers.
     Many other examples exist and are within the concepts herein.
     [0051] In the context of fracture treating the subterranean zone, cameras, including
     camera 112a, and enhanced video can be used in fracture mapping. In fracture treating
15   a subterranean zone, fracture fluid is pumped into the wellbore and into the
     subterranean zone at high pressure and high volumes to cause the subterranean zone to
     expand and fracture. The resulting fractures emanate outward from the wellbore into
     the subterranean zone, and subsequently operate to communicate fluids between the
     subterranean zone and the wellbore. The propagation of the fractures manifest effects
20   of movement on the terranean surface 108 that, without enhanced video, would be
     difficult to visually perceive or would not be visually perceptible. Video of the
     terranean surface 108 from the camera 112 is enhanced to exaggerate movement of the
     terranean surface 108 to make the movement readily, visually perceptible. As with
     seismic surveying, markers, such as those described above can be used to facilitate
                                                  27

   WO 2015/167537                                                               PCT/US2014/036192
     viewing the movement. By mapping the magnitude, location and direction of the
     movement at the terranean surface 108, as the fractures are being formed, an indication
     of the size (i.e., dimensions), location, and direction of propagation of the subterranean
     fractures can be determined. Moreover, the size and location of the completed
 5   fractures can be mapped, and in certain instances, mapped concurrently with the
     formation of the fractures. As above, movement signatures can be determined to
     identify the effects of fractures at the surface, and used to identify and quantify the
     fractures.
     [0052] The same concepts can be applied in mapping other types of injection
10   treatments. For example, in some types of injection treatments, fluids (gas/liquid) are
     pumped into the subterranean zone through one or more injection wells to treat the
     subterranean resources and/or the formations of the zone to enhance production. In
     certain instances, such as steam injection, the injection fluids can enhance production
     by improving the flow of the reservoir fluids through the subterranean zone. In
15   certain instances, such as water flood, the injection fluids can enhance production by
     sweeping or driving the reservoir fluids toward production wells. There are many
     other types of injection treatments relevant to the concepts herein. The propagation of
     the injection fluids through the subterranean zone can manifest effects of movement on
     the terranean surface 108 that, without enhanced video, would be difficult to visually
20   perceive or would not be visually perceptible. Video of the terranean surface 108 from
     the camera 112 is enhanced to exaggerate movement of the terranean surface 108 to
     make the movement readily, visually perceptible. As above, markers can be used to
     facilitate viewing the movement. By mapping the magnitude, location and direction of
     the movement at the terranean surface 108, an indication of the amount, location, and

     direction of propagation of the subterranean fluids can be determined. Moreover, this
     information can be mapped, and in certain instances, mapped concurrently with the
     injection treatment. As above, movement signatures can be determined to identify the
     effects of injection treatments at the surface, and used to identify and quantify the
 5   injection treatment.
     [0053] In the context of monitoring subterranean events from in the well 102, cameras,
     including camera 112c, and enhanced video can be used. FIGS. 7A and 7B show the
     well string 116 configured as a multi-zone gravel packed completion, having a
     plurality of packers 702 that seal with the wall of the wellbore 704 to define multiple
10   production zones. The completion is gravel packed in that gravel slurry has been
     introduced into the annulus around the exterior of the string 116, and acts to provide
     support to the wellbore 704 and as an initial filter against particulate. The well string
      116 includes one or more well screens 706 in each zone that act as a further filter
     against particulate. Some or all of the zones have a camera 112c mounted to the string
15    116 in an arrangement similar to that of FIG. 6A, having a target 708 on a movement
     sensitive base 710, encased in a downhole type housing 712. The housing 712 is
     shown as offset (i.e., outside the diameter of the base tubing of the string), but in other
     instances, the housing 712 could be at gauge (i.e., at the same diameter as the base
     tubing). Movement due to fluid flow and changes to the reservoir such as reservoir
20   compaction and fracture of the reservoir will cause the target 708 to move, and the
     camera 112c and enhanced video can be used to monitor movement to determine flow
     rate, fluid properties (e.g., gas/liquid ratios, water content and others), solid content in
     the fluid, seismic signals representing reservoir compaction, flow channeling through
     the gravel pack, whether the well screens 706 are blocked, erosion or damage to the

     well screen, restricted or flowing, identify alpha and beta waves of the gravel, and/or
     other information on a zone by zone basis. Movement due to operation of tools in the
     well string 116 will also cause the target 708 to move, and the camera 112c and
     enhanced video can be used to monitor movement to determine when and whether
 5   tools in the well string have operated. For example, operating packers, tools passing
     indicating collars in casing, and opening and closing valves and shifting side sleeves
     will cause the target 708 to move, as well as cause changes in flow that cause the target
     708 to move. In certain instances the camera 112c can be a thermal imaging camera
     and/or used with a thermal imaging camera, and the thermal video enhanced to
10   monitor effects of temperature of the fluids in the wellbore. Such monitoring can
     identify temperature changes of the fluids in the wellbore and in the subterranean zone
     that would be difficult to perceive or not perceptible with unenhanced thermal video.
     Temperature responsive coatings could alternatively or additionally be used with the
     camera 112c in identifying temperature changes. As above, monitoring temperature
15   could facilitate monitoring for gas flow water cut multiphase flow or other dynamic
     changes to the flow. As above, movement signatures can be determined to identify and
     quantify these different events.
     [0054] FIGS. 8A and 8B show a half cross-sectional view of other examples of the
     camera 112c mounted in the string 116 in an arrangement similar to that of FIG. 7A.
20   As above, the subassembly 800 has a target 802 on a vibration sensitive base 804
     encased in a housing 806. The housing 806 is shown as offset, but in other instances,
     the housing 806 could be at gauge. The subassembly 800 can be coupled (threadingly
     and/or otherwise) in-line with other tubing and devices of the string 116 as needed, for
     example, at one or more specified locations in the string 116 where monitoring with

     enhanced video is desired. In certain instances, the subassembly 800 can be
     configured to reside and operate in the well 102 (e.g., having a downhole type housing
     806). In certain instances, the subassembly 800 can be configured to reside and
     operate outside of the well 102, for example, placed at the top of the string 116 near
 5   the rig floor. The subassembly 800 can include a controller 808 for operating the
     camera 112a, storing video, and/or other functions. The subassembly 800 also
     includes a battery 808 for powering the camera 112a and controller 808.
     [0055] In certain instances, the subassembly 800 can incorporate one or more
     additional components. For example, the subassembly 800 can include one or more of
10   a sensor or sensor array 810a for sensing aspects inside the center bore of the string
      116, a sensor or sensor array 810b for sensing aspects outside of the subassembly 800
     (e.g., in the wellbore) and other components. In certain instances, the sensors 810a,
     810b and other components can include sensors for pressure, temperature, fluid
     properties, accelerometers, magnetometers, acoustic emitter/sensors (e.g.,
15   hydrophones, geophones), gamma emitter/sensors, and/or sensors for other aspects. In
     certain instances, the subassembly 800 can be a logging while drilling (LWD) tool or
     measurement while drilling (MWD) tool. By incorporating sensors with the camera
      112a, the subassembly 800 can make measurements in multiple domains, concurrently.
     Also, the subassembly 800 can make measurements in redundancy to the enhanced
20   video from camera 112a. For example, in addition to monitoring the movement of the
     string 116 with the camera 112a and enhanced video, the movement of the string 116
     can be monitored with hydrophones and/or accelerometers used as sensors 810a, 810b.
     The enhanced video and output from the sensors 810a, 810b can be compared to
     identify and eliminate noise.

     [0056] In FIG. 8, the subassembly 800 is shown with a communication line 812 for
     communication to a remote location, e.g., through the well 102 to a monitor device 118
     at the outside of the well 102. In certain instances, the communication line 812 is an
     electrical line, a fiber optic and/or another type of communication line 812. In other
 5   instances, the subassembly 800 can communicate on a well telemetry system, e.g., to a
     monitor device 118 outside of the well 102. In FIG. 8B, the subassembly 800 is shown
     with an output 814, such as a light, display, acoustic transducer (e.g., speaker) and/or
     other output for displaying status and other information to a person viewing the
     exterior of the subassembly 800. The subassembly 800 of FIG. 8B additional has a
10   data link port 816 for communication with the subassembly 800' while outside of the
     well 102. In other instances, the subassembly 800 can communicate wirelessly.
     [0057] In certain instances, the concepts herein can be applied in concert with an
     acoustic monitoring system as described in US Patent Publication 2012/0146805,
     entitled "Systems and Methods for Well Monitoring," published June 14, 2012, to
15   provide holistic well site monitoring. For example, both enhanced video and acoustic
     indications could be used to identify events and their effects. In certain instances, the
     system could include artificial intelligence to allow for quicker reaction or to enhance
     predictive value from the combined enhanced video and acoustic monitoring.
     [0058] Although described in connection with monitoring aspects of a well, the
20   concepts can be applied in other contexts, including refineries, production processing
     plants, pipeline gas compression stations, pipeline pump stations and/or other contexts.
