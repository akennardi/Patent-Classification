    DETERMINING RESIDUAL SURFACTANT CONCENTRATIONS IN PRODUCED
                                            WATER
The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent Application No.
<removed-apn>,     filed on 26 October 2016, which is itself a divisional application from
Australian Patent Application No. 2014262209, filed on 12 November 2014, which claims
priority from United States Patent Application Serial No. 14/228,152, filed on 27 March
2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
FIELD
[0001] The disclosure relates generally to a method for determining a first concentration of a
first component in an aqueous solution and more specifically to a method for determining
residual surfactant concentrations in produced water from an oil or gas well.
BACKGROUND
[0002] Surfactant is a chemical component in a hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") fluid which
is usually used to enhance initial production and to possibly improve long term production of
the reservoir. Different roles that surfactant play to increase the production are decreasing
capillary pressure of the fracturing fluid o inside formation rocks for effective flow back,
possibly emulsifying more oil globules and droplets in the reservoir and possibly changing
the wettability from oil-wet to water-wet, just to name a few. There has been a new trend of
using weakly emulsifying surfactant (WE) in the field over non-emulsifying surfactant (NE)
as WE surfactants seems to be effective in terms of enhanced oil recovery from various liquid
rich shale plays across North America.
[0003] Surfactant has proven to be critical to enhance initial production and sustain long term
production in low permeability oil and gas reservoirs. During hydraulic fracturing operations,
surfactants are pumped together with other chemicals to target formation zones. Once
surfactants reach downhole, they can interact specifically with oil molecules, strip them off
the rock and mobilize them through the reservoir. For those mechanisms to
                                                1

     deploy, it is believed that surfactants should remain             in the
     reservoir. To ensure optimum application of surfactants, operating
     and service companies have been searching for tools for tracking
     surfactant residuals in flow back and produced waters, which is
 5   thought to be possibly correlated with well productivity. One of the
     methods for determining how much surfactant is left in the
     reservoir is to monitor surfactant residuals in produced waters.
      Because of the presence of various total dissolved solids (TDS)
      levels and other fracturing additives such as friction reducers, scale
10    inhibitors or biocides, it is not an easy task to track surfactant
      residuals. Conventional methods such as methylene blue (MB)
      based absorbance measurements take into account the bonding
      between anionic surfactants and cationic MB, but MB would bond
      with anything that is anionic in produced waters, resulting in
15    erroneous analysis.      Therefore, following the conventional dye
      based approach, such as methylene blue that typically combines
      with anionic surfactants, requires that the concentration of the
      combined complex be determined by using spectroscopic methods.
      This approach, however, can lead to erroneous results because of
20    the presence of anionic friction reducers, scale inhibitor and/or
      gelled fluids.

    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    [0022]        The present disclosure may be understood more readily by
20     reference     to   the   following    detailed    description   of  preferred
       embodiments of the disclosure as well as to the examples included
       therein. All numeric values are herein assumed to be modified by
       the term "about," whether or not explicitly indicated.              The term
       "about" generally refers to a range of numbers that one of skill in
25     the art would consider equivalent to the recited value (i.e., having
       the same function or result). In many instances, the term "about"
        may     include    numbers      that   are    rounded      to  the   nearest
        significant figure.

   [0023]        One embodiment relates to a method for determining a
      first concentration of a first component in an aqueous solution.
      Various embodiments take advantage of dynamic diffusion profiles
       between liquid phases at different surfactant concentrations, which
 5     are unique to each individual surfactant. To determine the first
       concentration of the first component in the aqueous solution, the
       method can include a step of identifying a second concentration of
       at least one second component in the aqueous solution.             The
       second concentration can be identified by any conventional means,
10     including   but not     limited to spectroscopy.      Additionally   or
       alternatively, to identify the second component such as a scale
       inhibitor, a colormetric method can be used. In particular, the
       tagging agent on the scale inhibitor can be reacted with the test
       solution and its concentration can be measured by contacting the
15     reacted test solutions with colormetric paper.
    [0024]       Both the first component and the second component can
       alter the surface tension of the aqueous solution.
    [0025]       The first component can be a surfactant. For example, the
       first component can be a nonionic surfactant, an ionic surfactant, an
20     amphoteric surfactant, or any combination of surfactants.

   [0029]       Fracturing is the process of creating fractures in oil and
      gas formations to stimulate or increase production in oil and gas
 5    wells. The fracturing operation involves the injection of fracturing
      fluid into the wellbore at sufficient pressures, flow rates and
      volumes to fracture the surrounding formation. The fracturing fluid
      may comprise a base fluid, such as water or gels, and a variety of
      additives including polymers, friction reducers, cross-linkers, anti
10    scaling agents, proppants and biocides.      The first component can
      also be an oil field chemical including, but not limited to production
      chemicals, fracturing fluid, surfactants, biocides, scale inhibitors,
      wax solvents, asphaltenes inhibitors, pour point depressants,
      biocides, water clarifiers, shale and clay stabilizers, emulsion
15    breakers, antifoams, scale inhibitors, H2S and         02  scavengers,

      additives that may also be added to the fracturing fluid include
      emulsion    breakers,   antifoams,   scale inhibitors, H2S and 02
      scavengers, biocides, surface tension reducers, shale and clay
20    stabilizers, paraffin/asphaltene inhibitors and corrosion inhibitors.
      The first component can be any component that alters the surface
      tension of the aqueous solution.
   [0030]       A plurality of aqueous test solutions can be prepared or
      otherwise obtained.     The plurality of aqueous test solutions can
25    include the first component at a plurality of concentrations and the
      at least one second component at the second concentration.           For
      example, as illustrated in FIG. 1, a plurality 200 of aqueous test
      solutions 201, 202, 203, 204 are shown.        The first aqueous test
      solution 201 includes a first component at a concentration 206 and
                                        8

      a second component at a second concentration 205.          The second
      aqueous test solution 202 includes a first component at a
      concentration   207 and a second component at the second
      concentration 205. The third aqueous test solution 203 includes a
 5    first component at a concentration 208 and a second component at
      the second concentration 205.       The fourth aqueous test solution
      204 includes a first component at a concentration 209 and a second
      component     at the second concentration       205.      The second
      concentration 205 of the second component can be the same in
10    each of the plurality 200 of aqueous test solutions 201, 202, 203,
      204. The concentrations 206, 207, 208, 209 of the first component
      can vary among the plurality 200 of aqueous test solutions 201,
      202, 203, 204 such that the plurality 200 of aqueous test solutions
      201, 202, 203, 204 includes the first component at a plurality
15    of concentrations.
   [0031]       According to certain preferred embodiments, each of the
      plurality of aqueous test solutions can include a plurality of second
      components. The plurality of second components can be selected
      such that, but for the varying concentrations of the first component,
20    the aqueous test solution mirrors the composition of the produced
      water from an oil well.       For example, the plurality of second
      components can be selected such that the composition of the
      aqueous test solution includes the same concentration of each of a
      plurality of minerals in the produced water. Compounds that do not
25    alter the surface tension of the produced water can be, but do not
      need to be included among the plurality of second components.
      According to various preferred embodiments, the aqueous test
      solution includes all surface tension altering compounds that are in
                                        9

      the produced water at the same concentration as those compounds
      are present in the produced water.
   [0032]      The concentration of the first component in each aqueous
      test solution can be within a range having a lower limit and/or an
 5    upper limit. The range can include or exclude the lower limit and/or
      the upper limit. The lower limit and/or upper limit can be selected
      from 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800,

      22800, 22900, and 23000 ppm.       For example, according to certain
 5    preferred embodiments, the concentration of the first component in
      each aqueous test solution can be from 0.1 to 20000 ppm.
   [0033]       The aqueous solution can be produced water from an oil
      well.   The produced water can be collected from the well head of
      the oil well. Again, to determine the first concentration of the first
10    component in the aqueous solution, the method can include a step
      of identifying a second concentration of at least one second
      component in the aqueous solution. The second component can be
      any component that alters the surface tension of the aqueous
      solution.   The second component can be any of the compounds
15    identified above as preferable first components.    Similarly, the first
      component can be any of the compounds identified below as
      preferable second components.      The first and second components
      are preferably different compounds.
   [0034]       In addition to being any of the compounds identified above
20    as possible first components, the at least one second component
      can be, a friction reducer, a scale inhibitor, surfactants, biocides,
      scale inhibitors, wax solvents, asphaltenes inhibitors, pour point
      depressants, demulsifiers, biocides, water clarifiers, shale and clay
      stabilizers, emulsion breakers, antifoams, scale inhibitors, H2S and
25    02  scavengers, corrosion inhibitors, and combinations thereof.
   [0035]       The friction reducer can include, but is not limited to
      reducing agents that comprise polymers, including generally high
      molecular weight linear polymers or polymers that have been

   "high molecular weight" is meant to encompass those polymers
   having a molecular weight of from about 5 to about 25 million or
   more.    These     polymers    may   be   pumped     at   low    enough
 5 concentrations such that they do not significantly increase the

      mineral acids, adsorbents, polyamines and polyacrylates and their
      derivatives, alkyl substituted benzene sulfonic acids, alkyl phenolic
      resins and their derivatives, substituted polyalcohols, and the like.

10    such as sodium hypochlorite (bleach), potassium hypochlorite and
      calcium hypochlorite; sodium bromide; hydantoins; peracetic acid;

      the present disclosure may be pentafluorobenzyl bromide, 2,3,5,6

 5    the     block    copolymer     chain     may    be    chlorine-terminated
      poly(dimethylsiloxane),             or          glycidylether-terminated
      poly(dimethylsiloxane), etc. The halocarbon compound or the
      silicon compound can be bound to the polymeric chain in the
      amount of 1 to 50 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of
10    total dispersant. When the amount is less than 1 part by weight,
      the affinity effect for the supercritical fluid by a substituent group
      cannot be obtained. When the amount exceeds 50 parts by weight,
      the solubility and dispersion stability to the dispersion solvent are
      decreased.
15 [0040]        Suitable examples of biocides may include both oxidizing
      biocides and nonoxidizing biocides. Examples of oxidizing biocides
      may include sodium hypochlorite, hypochlorous acid, chlorine,
      bromine, chlorine dioxide, and hydrogen peroxide. Examples of
      non-oxidizing      biocides    may     include   aldehydes      (such   as
20    formaldehyde        and     glutaraldehyde),       quaternary      amines,
      isothizaolines, carbamates, phosphonium quaternary compounds,
      and halogenated compounds (such as dibromonitrilopropionamide
      and bromonitropropanediol). Examples of suitable biocides may
      include those commercially available from             Halliburton Energy
25    Services     Inc.,  in   Duncan,    Okla.,   under    the   trade   names
      "ALDACIDE@ G," "BE3 Tm," "BE6T"," and "BE7T"."
   [0041]        The method can further include comparing a plurality of
      dynamic surface tension measurements of each of the plurality of
      aqueous test solutions with at least one dynamic surface tension
                                         14

   measurement of the aqueous solution to determine the first
   concentration.    As a result of the adsorption of a surfactant at a
   surface or interface of one or more liquids, a reduction of interfacial
   tension occurs. Immediately after the surface is produced, the
 5 interfacial tension has the same value as the pure liquid(s). The
   value then reduces until an equilibrium value is reached. With a
   dynamic tensiometer (e.g. drop volume tensiometer or bubble
   pressure tensiometer), the size of the interface changes during the
   measurement. In spite of this, if the change is sufficiently slow, an
10 equilibrium value can often be measured as well as the time
   dependent values. In return, the establishment of the equilibrium
   value with respect to time can also be pursued using static methods
   in which the size of the interface does not change. The plurality of
   dynamic surface tension measurements of each of a plurality of
15 aqueous test solutions and the plurality of dynamic surface tension
    measurements of the aqueous solution can be obtained using any
   suitable method, including but not limited to the maximum bubble
    pressure technique specified in ASTM      D3825-09,    pendant drop
    method, wihelmy plate method, Langmuir trough method, and
20  combinations thereof.    The plurality of dynamic surface tension
    measurements can be used to create a diffusion profile that is
    specific to the first component.    Subsequently, a dynamic surface
    tension measurement of a new sample, such as a produced water
    sample from the head of an oil well can be compared to the
25  diffusion  profile to determine the concentration       of the first
    component in the produced water sample. Such measurements can
    be useful to decide surfactant pumping rate and surfactant
    performance during and after hydraulic fracturing operations. In
    addition, these measurements serve a vital role to tailor the
                                     15

      surfactant additive to specific reservoir conditions in order to
      achieve higher oil recovery.
   [0042]       The diffusion profile can include a dynamic surface tension
      measurement for each of a number of aqueous test solutions. The
 5    number of aqueous test solutions can be within a range having a
      lower limit and/or an upper limit. The range can include or exclude
      the lower limit and/or the upper limit. The lower limit and/or upper
      limit can be selected from 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50,
      55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350,
10    400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000,
       1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000,
      2100, 2200, 2300, 2400, and 2500.           For example, according to
      certain preferred     embodiments,     the number of aqueous test
      solutions can be from 1 to 1000.
15 [0043]        According to various embodiments, once the concentration
      of the first component is determined, the first concentration can be
      used in a material balance to determine one of the following: a
       pumping rate of the first component; an amount of the first
      component in the oil well, surfactants, biocides, scale inhibitors,
20    wax solvents, asphaltenes inhibitors, pour point depressants,
      demulsifiers, biocides, water clarifiers, shale and clay stabilizers,
       emulsion    breakers,   antifoams,   scale  inhibitors, H2S and    02
       scavengers, corrosion inhibitors, and combinations thereof.      The
       amount of the first component added to the well is known.       Once
25    the concentration of the first component in produced water from the
       well is known, the amount of the first component in the well can be
       determined using a material balance.         Parameters, such as the
       pumping rate of the first component into the well can be adjusted
       based on the amount of the first component determined to be in
                                        16

      the well compared to the amount of the first component desired in
      the well. Most surfactants have been deliberately added in a known
      concentration, for example, at 1000 to 3000 parts per million, to
      the oil reservoir. If the surfactant is present in the produced water
 5    from the oil well, then the surfactant is not doing its job and has no
      impact on long-term production.          Since various embodiments
      provide a reliable determination of the amount of surfactant coming
      out of the well, a material balance can be used to determine what is
      left in the well.
10 [0044]        Various embodiments relate to a method for determining
      the concentration of a target component in an aqueous sample
      solution.    The method can include identifying an aqueous sample
      solution including the target component and at least one secondary
      background component, wherein both the target component and
15    the at least one secondary background component are surface
      tension altering components; measuring the concentration of the at
       least one secondary background component; conducting a plurality
      of dynamic surface tension measurements with an aqueous test
      solution    comprising the    at least one secondary        background
20    component       at the   measured    concentration    and   the  target
      component at a plurality of concentrations to obtain a calibrative
      dynamic surface tension fingerprint of the aqueous test solution as
      a function of the concentration of the target component; and
       measuring the dynamic surface tension of the sample aqueous
25    solution and comparing       the dynamic surface tension to the
       calibrative dynamic    surface tension    fingerprint  to obtain   the
       concentration of the target component in the aqueous sample
       solution. The concentration of surface tension altering compounds
       in the produced water can change over time. Therefore, it can be
                                        17

     beneficial to recreate the calibrative dynamic surface tension
     fingerprint repeatedly over time. As shown, for example, in FIG. 3,
     a calibrative dynamic surface tension's fingerprint can be created
     using dynamic surface tension (DST) measurements of a surfactant
 5   at different concentrations in DI water taken over time. In Figure
     3, as the surface age increases, surface tension reduces indicating
     that surfactant adsorption is occurring on the water-air surface as
     aging time increases. The slope of DST when plotted against square
     root of time is equivalent to 4RTC(D/n) 0 5 .     When this slope is
10   plotted against the bulk concentration of surfactant, it ideally should
      be a straight line if diffusivity of the monomer concentration is
     considered. FIG. 4b shows the linear region of slope against the
     concentration. A straight line fits the data most accurately and
      shows that the surfactant in the water phase is in a monomeric
15    state and the concentration is still lower than CMC. There is usually
      a change of slope as the concentration passes through the CMC or
      nano-aggregation    concentration. The     range of 100-1000 ppm
      concentration is selected based on the range of residual surfactant
      concentration obtained in the produced water. If the DST of an
20    unknown concentration is measured in the range of the calibration
      curve, the concentration of the surfactant can be estimated.      From
      FIGS. 3 and 4 it can be seen that it is possible to measure an
      unknown concentration of the surfactant in DI water once the
      calibration curves are known for DST and UV-Vis.
25 [0045]       The exemplary methods and compositions disclosed herein
      may directly or indirectly affect one or more components or pieces
      of equipment associated with the preparation, delivery, recapture,
      recycling, reuse, and/or disposal of the disclosed compositions. For
      example, and with reference to FIG. 11, the disclosed methods and
                                       18

      compositions may directly or indirectly affect one            or more
      components or pieces of equipment associated with an exemplary
      fracturing system 10, according to one or more embodiments.          In
      certain   instances, the system      10 includes a fracturing fluid
 5    producing apparatus 20, a fluid source 30, a proppant source 40,
      and a pump and blender system 50 and resides at the surface at a
      well site where a well 60 is located.        In certain instances, the
      fracturing fluid producing apparatus 20 combines a gel pre-cursor
      with fluid (e.g., liquid or substantially liquid) from fluid source 30,
10    to produce a hydrated fracturing fluid that is used to fracture the
      formation.    The hydrated fracturing fluid can be a fluid for ready
      use in a fracture stimulation treatment of the well 60 or a
      concentrate to which additional fluid is added prior to use in a
      fracture stimulation    of the well 60.       In other instances, the
15    fracturing fluid producing apparatus 20 can be omitted and the
      fracturing fluid sourced directly from the fluid source 30. In certain
      instances, the fracturing fluid may comprise water, a hydrocarbon
      fluid, a polymer gel, foam, air, wet gases and/or other fluids.
   [0046]       The proppant source 40 can include a proppant for
20    combination with the fracturing fluid. The system may also include
      additive source 70 that provides one or more additives (e.g., gelling
      agents, weighting agents, and/or other optional additives) to alter
      the properties of the fracturing fluid.        For example, the other
      additives 70 can be included to reduce pumping friction, to reduce
25    or eliminate the fluid's reaction to the geological formation in which
      the well is formed, to operate as surfactants, and/or to serve other
      functions.
   [0047]       The pump and blender system 50 receives the fracturing
      fluid and combines it with other components, including proppant
                                        19

      from the proppant source 40 and/or additional fluid from the
      additives 70. The resulting mixture may be pumped down the well
      60 under a pressure sufficient to create or enhance one or more
      fractures in a subterranean zone, for example, to stimulate
 5    production of fluids from the zone. Notably, in certain instances,
      the fracturing fluid producing apparatus 20, fluid source 30, and/or
      proppant source 40 may be equipped with one or more metering
      devices (not shown) to control the flow of fluids, proppants, and/or
      other compositions to the pumping and blender system 50.        Such
10    metering devices may permit the pumping and blender system 50
      can source from one, some or all of the different sources at a given
      time, and may facilitate the preparation of fracturing fluids in
      accordance with the present disclosure using continuous mixing or
      "on-the-fly" methods. Thus, for example, the pumping and blender
15    system 50 can provide just fracturing fluid into the well at some
      times, just proppants at other times, and combinations of those
      components at yet other times.
   [0048]       FIG. 12 shows the well 60 during a fracturing operation in
      a portion of a subterranean formation of interest 102 surrounding a
20    well bore 104.    The well bore 104 extends from the surface 106,
      and the fracturing fluid     108 is applied to a portion of the
      subterranean formation 102 surrounding the horizontal portion of
      the well bore. Although shown as vertical deviating to horizontal,
      the well bore 104 may include horizontal, vertical, slant, curved,
25    and other types of well bore geometries and orientations, and the
      fracturing treatment may be applied to a subterranean zone
      surrounding any portion of the well bore.    The well bore 104 can
      include a casing 110 that is cemented or otherwise secured to the
      well bore wall.     The well bore 104 can be uncased or include
                                      20

      uncased sections. Perforations can be formed in the casing 110 to
      allow fracturing fluids and/or other materials to flow into the
      subterranean formation 102.      In cased wells, perforations can be
      formed using shape charges, a perforating gun, hydro-jetting
 5    and/or other tools.
   [0049]       The well is shown with a work string 112 depending from
      the surface 106 into the well bore 104.       The pump and blender
      system 50 is coupled a work string 112 to pump the fracturing fluid
       108 into the well bore 104.    The working string 112 may include
10    coiled tubing, jointed pipe, and/or other structures that allow fluid
      to flow into the well bore 104. The working string 112 can include
      flow control devices, bypass valves, ports, and or other tools or well
      devices that control a flow of fluid from the interior of the working
      string 112 into the subterranean zone 102.           For example, the
15    working string 112 may include ports adjacent the well bore wall to
      communicate the fracturing fluid 108 directly into the subterranean
      formation 102, and/or the working string 112 may include ports
      that are spaced apart from the well bore wall to communicate the
      fracturing fluid 108 into an annulus in the well bore between the
20    working string 112 and the well bore wall.
   [0050]        The working string 112 and/or the well bore 104 may
       include one or more sets of packers 114 that seal the annulus
       between the working string 112 and well bore 104 to define an
       interval of the well bore 104 into which the fracturing fluid 108 will
25     be pumped.      FIG. 12 shows two packers 114, one defining an
       uphole boundary of the interval and one defining the downhole end
       of the interval. When the fracturing fluid 108 is introduced into well
       bore 104 (e.g., in FIG. 12, the area of the well bore 104 between
       packers 114) at a sufficient hydraulic pressure, one or more
                                       21

      fractures 116 may be created in the subterranean zone 102. The
      proppant particulates in the fracturing fluid 108 may enter the
      fractures 116 where they may remain after the fracturing fluid flows
      out of the well bore.     These proppant particulates may "prop"
 5    fractures 116 such that fluids may flow more freely through the
      fractures 116.

      methods and compositions may also directly or indirectly affect any

   EXAMPLES
   [0052]        Residual surfactant concentration was measured in the
       produced water from various wells from the Barnett using the
      dynamic      surface    tension   technique,   according    to   various
 5    embodiments,        which    allows    for   accurate    measurements.
       Comparison of dynamic surface tension is actually comparing
       diffusion coefficient and reaction kinetics of adsorption of one or
       more known molecules in the produced water. Short time kinetics
       of adsorption of different molecules is different based on their
10     chemical nature and molecular size. UV-Vis spectroscopy is used to
       confirm the results. An estimate of residual concentrations from UV
       Vis   seems    to   be   coherent    with  dynamic    surface   tension
       measurement value.
   [0053]        Such measurements can be useful to decide surfactant
15     pumping     rate  and surfactant     performance    during   and after
       hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, these measurements
       serve a vital role to tailor the surfactant additive to specific
       reservoir conditions in order to achieve higher oil recovery. Real
       time production results from those different wells are analyzed and
20     seem to be dependent on the corresponding residual surfactant
       concentrations from the produced waters. This unique technique is
       used for the first time to study and analyze the produced water for
       surfactant additive concentration.
    [0054]       The examples provided herein measure residual surfactant
25     concentration    by measuring      the dynamic     surface tension of
       produced water. Measuring residual surfactant in the produced
       water can be extremely useful to understand the performance of
       the surfactant in the field. Real time measurement of such quantity
       in the flowback can even help us understand the how much of
                                         23

      surfactant is getting used and if we need to add more or less during
      pumping in future timeframe.
   [0055]       Because of the presence of various total dissolved solids
      (TDS)    levels and   other fracturing    additives such    as friction
 5    reducers, scale inhibitors or biocides, it is not an easy task to track
      surfactant residuals. Conventional methods such as methylene blue
      (MB)    based absorbance measurements take into account the
      bonding between anionic surfactants and cationic MB, but MB would
      bond with anything that is anionic in produced waters, resulting in
10    erroneous analysis.      Therefore, following the conventional dye
      based approach, such as methylene blue that typically combines
      with anionic surfactants, it is required that the concentration of the
      combined complex be determined by using spectroscopic methods.
      This approach, however, can lead to erroneous results because of
15    the presence of anionic friction reducers, scale inhibitor or gelled
      fluids.
   [0056]        Surfactants have a unique property to diffuse to the
       interface as soon as it is created. Making use of this property,
      dynamic surface tension of surfactant containing fluid is measured
20     by using bubble pressure technique. As surface age of the bubble
       increases, more surfactant adsorb at the surface causing surface
      tension to drop. For short times, there are no molecules of
       surfactants at the surface once the surface is created and excess
       molecules of surfactants in the bulk phase. Therefore, concentration
25     gradient i.e. diffusion drives the surfactant adsorption at short
       times. The adsorption can be explained by the Ward-Tordai
       equation which considers process to be diffusion controlled. For
       short times:
    [0057]                   4RTC                     Eq. 1
                                        24

   [0058]        The parameters C, y, yo and D are bulk concentration of
      surfactant monomers, surface tension, surface tension of pure
       solvent and      diffusion  coefficient  of monomer      concentration
       respectively. Diffusivity of a molecule is a unique property for a
 5     solute solvent system. Once diffusivity is known concentration can
       be estimated with the equation mentioned above. Of course,
       surfactant that has been used in the field is not just one molecule
       it's actually a mixture of different chemicals. Hence, the effective
       diffusivity of the surfactant in the solvent (or produced water) is
10     first estimated to estimate the concentration.
   [0059]         TDS affects diffusivity of surfactant molecule in the bulk
       phase. It has been studied and recognized that surface tension
       depends and diffusivity of surfactant depends upon the TDS of the
       produced water. It is important to know the water analysis of
15     produced water to understand which salts and ions are present in
       the produced water which might affect the diffusivity of the
       surfactant. For different wells, concentration of different ions differs
       significantly.   FIG. 2 is a chart showing ionic concentrations of
       various formation waters of oil fields from various parts of the
20     world.    As seen from FIG. 2, the diffusivity of the surfactant can
       differ by an order of magnitudes from well to well.
    [0060]        Measurement of effective diffusivity of a surfactant in
       particular brine from short time Ward-Tordai equation enable us to
       measure the concentration of unknown surfactant concentration in
25     the same solvent phase. Measurements from              UV-Vis   spectra
       confirm the estimation from DST measurements.
                                         25

   EXAMPLE 1
   [0061]        A purpose     of this example was         to determine   the
      concentration of surfactant in DI water.         DI water was used to
      demonstrate an estimation of an equivalent diffusion coefficient.
 5     FIG. 3 shows the dynamic surface tension (DST) of surfactant at
      different concentration in DI water. As surface age increases,
       surface tension reduces indicating that surfactant adsorption on the
       water-air surface as aging time increases.
   [0062]        At short times, from Equation 1, the slope of DST when
10     plotted against square root of time is equivalent to 4RTC(D/n)        5.
       When this slope is plotted against the bulk concentration of
       surfactant, it ideally should be a straight line if diffusivity of
       monomer concentration is considered. FIG. 4b shows the linear
       region of slope against the concentration. Straight line fits the data
15     almost accurately showing that the surfactant in water phase is in
       monomeric state and concentration is still lower than CMC. There is
       usually a change of slope as concentration passes through the CMC
       or nano-aggregation concentration. The range of concentration
       100-1000 ppm is selected based on the range of residual surfactant
20     concentration obtained      in the produced       water. The effective
       diffusivity of the surfactant is 3.92x10-8 m2 /s from Eq. 1 and FIG. 4.
       Hence, if the DST of unknown concentration is measured in the
       range of the calibration curve, the concentration of the surfactant
       can be estimated.
25  [0063]        From FIGS. 3 and 4 it can be seen that, it is possible to
       measure unknown concentration of the surfactant in DI water once
       the calibration curves are known for DST and UV-Vis.         To confirm
       this calibration    curve  over the concentration       range, UV-   vis
       spectroscopy is used.       As shown in FIG. 5, one of the main
                                          26

      ingredients in the surfactant gives a molecular absorption peak
      around 215-235 nm, as the molecular concentration increases
      absorption increases. For the same range of concentrations, the
      calibration curve is plotted, which shows an extremely good fit to
 5    the data.
   [0064]        A sample of 600 ppm surfactant was prepared and from
      DST and UV-vis spectroscopy the concentration was estimated.       As
      seen from FIG. 6, it is seen that DST and UV-vis predictions are
      closer to actual value of the concentration. Prediction from DST
10    seems to be closer to the actual          value.    Therefore,   DST
      measurement can be utilized for concentration prediction.
   EXAMPLE 2
   [0065]        A  purpose   of this  example   was   to  determine    the
15    concentration of residual surfactant in produced water from an oil
       well.    As mentioned in introduction to the Examples, different
       produced    waters have different TDS.       Hence,  interaction of
       surfactant in the bulk phase changes affecting its diffusivity.
      Therefore, it is mandatory to match the TDS of produced water to a
20     calibration curve.   From water analysis of one of the wells from
       Barnett, synthetic brine was prepared.    Analysis of the water is
       shown below in Table 1, which shows formation water analyses
       from ion exchange chromatography.

 5 [0066]        Synthetic brine was prepared to these specific ionic
       concentrations of different salts. DST was measured for different
       concentrations to build a calibration curve shown in FIG. 7.   FIG. 7
       shows the slope from DST of different surfactant concentrations in
       synthetic brine against concentration of surfactant.     The slope of
10     this curve is almost three times as it was for DI water. Therefore, it
       seems that surface tension drop and diffusivity increase with
       increase in TDS of the produced water.
                                        28

   EXAMPLE 3
   [0067]        A purpose of this example is to demonstrate real time
       production data and residual surfactant concentration. For these
       Barnett wells, 3 gpt of the surfactant was injected into the well with
 5    fracturing fluid. After measuring calibration curve in the synthetic
       brine, DST of produced water samples from the field is measured as
       they are received after every few days. DST data of different
       samples received at different dates are shown in FIG. 8. For the
       short time slope, DST is plotted against the square root of time.
10     FIG. 8 (a) is a chart showing DST of produced water at different
       days. FIG. 8(b) is a chart showing surface tension against square
       root of time for the same.
    [0068]       From the calibration curve, the residual concentration of
       produced water can be estimated as shown in FIG. 9. More
15     specifically, FIG. 9 provides a prediction of residual concentration of
       surfactant in produced water from calibration curve.
    [0069]       Similarly, for different produced water samples collected at
       different days of flow back, we measure DST and predict the
        residual concentration of surfactant. FIG. 10 shows the real time oil
20      and gas production data with residual surfactant concentration in
       the flow back water.
    [0070]       It is seen that as time progresses, concentration of
        surfactant in produced water decreases. This observation             is
        coherent with the fact that more the aging time given to surfactants
25      downhole, more it will adsorb on oil and rock surfaces downhole.
        Real time surfactant utilization can be estimated from such
        measurements. On September 09, 2013, utilization of surfactant
        was around 83%, indicating that 83% of injected surfactant was
        being utilized in the well. By the end of October 26,            2013,
                                          29

      utilization    of surfactant  increased   to  98%.    With   increasing
      adsorption of surfactant in downhole conditions, more oil and gas
      production is seen from the real time production data. Such data
      indicates that the surfactants effectively adsorb on oil surfaces to
 5    mobilize it forming weak emulsions and bringing it to the surface.
   [0071]        Based on Examples 1 - 3, initial adsorption kinetics from
      dynamic surface tension data is diffusion limited.        By using the
      Ward Tordai equation for short times, unique linear curve of slope
      of concentration against square root of time against concentration
10    can be obtained. The slope of such curve is a diffusivity equivalent
      and follows extremely good linear fit. Hence, by measuring DST of
      unknown       concentration  of surfactant    we   can   estimate   the
      concentration from such calibration curve. The estimate from DST is
      very accurate and is coherent with UV-Vis measurement.
15 [0072]        The diffusivity equivalent slope is sensitive to TDS of the
      water. Synthetic brine is prepared from the water analysis of
      produced well and calibration curve is obtained. Such calibration
      curve is used to estimate concentration of residual surfactant in
      produced water.
20 [0073]        Real time field data suggests that surfactant utilization
      increases with aging time. It is seen from the data that as
      surfactant utilization increases oil-gas production increases.
