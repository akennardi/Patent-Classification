                     MEDICAMENTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF HEPATITIS B
 5 Background Art
   The present application is a divisional application of Australian Application No. 2014247138,
   which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.
 0 The Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an enveloped, partially double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus of
   the Hepadnavirus family (Hepadnaviridae).Its genome contains 4 overlapping reading frames:
   the precore/core gene; the polymerase gene; the L, M, and S genes, which encode for the 3
   envelope proteins; and the X gene.
   Upon infection, the partially double-stranded DNA genome (the relaxed circular DNA; rcDNA)
 5 is converted to a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus of the host cell and
   the viral mRNAs are transcribed. Once encapsidated, the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), which also
   codes for core protein and Pol, serves as the template for reverse transcription, which regenerates
   the partially dsDNA genome (rcDNA) in the nucleocapsid.
   HBV has caused epidemics in parts of Asia and Africa, and it is endemic in China. HBV has
 0 infected approximately 2 billion people worldwide of which approximately 350 million people
   have developed chronic infections. The virus causes the disease hepatitis B and chronic infection
   is correlated with a strongly increased risk for the development cirrhosis and hepatocellular
   carcinoma.
   Transmission of hepatitis B virus results from exposure to infectious blood or body fluids, while
 5 viral DNA has been detected in the saliva, tears, and urine of chronic carriers with high titer
   DNA in serum.
   An effective and well-tolerated vaccine exists, but direct treatment options are currently limited
   to interferon and the following antivirals; tenofovir, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir and
30 telbivudine.
   In addition, heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs) were identified as a class of HBV inhibitors in
   tissue culture and animal models (Weber et al., Antiviral Res. 54: 69-78).
35 WO/2013/006394, published on January 10 2013, relates to a subclass of Sulphamoyl
   arylamides active against HBV.
   Amongst the problems which HBV direct antivirals may encounter are toxicity, mutagenicity,
   lack of selectivity, poor efficacy, poor bioavailability, and difficulty of synthesis.

There is a need for additional HBV inhibitors that may overcome at least one of these
disadvantages or that have additional advantages such as increased potency or an increased
safety window.

25 Definitions
   The term "C1_ 3 alkyl" as a group or part of a group refers to a hydrocarbyl radical of Formula
   C.H2n+1 wherein n is a number ranging from 1 to 3. In case C1_3 alkyl is coupled to a further
   radical, it refers to a Formula C.H   2n. C1_3 alkyl groups comprise from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, more
   preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms. C1_3 alkyl includes all linear, or branched alkyl groups with
30 between 1 and 3 carbon atoms, and thus includes such as for example methyl, ethyl, n-propyl,
   and i-propyl.
   C14 alkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon
   radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as the group defined for C1_3 alkyl and butyl and
   the like.
35 C1_6 alkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon
   radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as the groups defined for C14 alkyl and pentyl,
   hexyl, 2-methylbutyl and the like.

                                                      -4
   The term "C1_ 3alkyloxy" as a group or part of a group refers to a radical having the Formula -
   OR' wherein R is C1_3 alkyl. Non-limiting examples of suitable C1_3 alkyloxy include methyloxy
   (also methoxy), ethyloxy (also ethoxy), propyloxy and isopropyloxy.
 5
   The term oxo, C(=O), or carbonyl refers to a group composed of a carbon atom double bonded to
   an oxygen atom.
   As used herein, the term "3-7 membered saturated ring" means saturated cyclic hydrocarbon
 0 with 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 carbon atoms and is generic to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl,
   cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl.
   Such saturated ring optionally contains one or more heteroatoms, such that at least one carbon
   atom is replaced by a heteroatom selected from N, 0 and S, in particular from N and 0.
   Examples include oxetane, tetrahydro-2H-pyranyl, piperidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, morpholinyl,
 5 thiolane 1,1-dioxide and pyrrolidinyl. Preferred are saturated cyclic hydrocarbon with 3 or 4
   carbon atoms and 1 oxygen atom. Examples include oxetane, and tetrahydrofuranyl.
   It should be noted that different isomers of the various heterocycles may exist within the
   definitions as used throughout the specification. For example, pyrrolyl may be 1H-pyrrolyl or
 0 2H-pyrrolyl.
   The term halo and halogen are generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo. Preferred halogens are
   fluoro and chloro.
 5 It should also be noted that the radical positions on any molecular moiety used in the definitions
   may be anywhere on such moiety as long as it is chemically stable. For instance pyridyl includes
   2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl and 4-pyridyl; pentyl includes 1-pentyl, 2-pentyl and 3-pentyl.
   Positions indicated on phenyl (e.g. ortho, meta and/orpara) are indicated relative to the bond
30 connecting the phenyl to the main structure. An example with regard to the position of R , any
   location is indicated relative to the nitrogen (*) connected to the main structure:
                                     R1        IR2

                                  H
   When any variable (e.g. halogen or C1_4 alkyl) occurs more than one time in any constituent, each
   definition is independent.

                                                     -5
   For therapeutic use, the salts of the compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the counter ion
   is pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable. However, salts having a pharmaceutically
   unacceptable counter ion may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a
   pharmaceutically acceptable compound of formula (I). All salts, whether pharmaceutically
 5 acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention.
   The pharmaceutically acceptable or physiologically tolerable addition salt forms which the
   compounds of the present invention are able to form can conveniently be prepared using the
   appropriate acids, such as, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g.
 0 hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid; sulfuric; hemisulphuric, nitric; phosphoric and the like acids;
   or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, aspartic, dodecylsulphuric, heptanoic, hexanoic,
   nicotinic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric,
   malic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic,
   cyclamic, salicylic, p-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids.
 5
   Conversely said acid addition salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate base
    into the free base form.
   The term "salts" also comprises the hydrates and the solvent addition forms that the compounds
   of the present invention are able to form. Examples of such forms are e.g. hydrates, alcoholates
 0 and the like.
   The present compounds may also exist in their tautomeric forms For example, tautomeric forms
   of amide (-C(=O)-NH-) groups are iminoalcohols (-C(OH)=N-). Tautomeric forms, although not
   explicitly indicated in the structural formulae represented herein, are intended to be included
   within the scope of the present invention.
-5
   The term stereochemically isomeric forms of compounds of the present invention, as used
   hereinbefore, defines all possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded by the same
   sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not
   interchangeable, which the compounds of the present invention may possess. Unless otherwise
30 mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound encompasses the mixture of all
   possible stereochemically isomeric forms which said compound may possess. Said mixture may
   contain all diastereomers and/or enantiomers of the basic molecular structure of said compound.
   All stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of the present invention both in pure
   form or in admixture with each other are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present
35 invention.
   Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates as mentioned herein are defined
   as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the same basic
   molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates. In particular, the term

                                                     -6
   'stereoisomerically pure' concerns compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of
   at least 80% (i. e. minimum 90% of one isomer and maximum 10% of the other possible
   isomers) up to a stereoisomeric excess of 100% (i.e. 100% of one isomer and none of the other),
   more in particular, compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of 90% up to
 5 100%, even more in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 94% up to 100% and most in
   particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 97% up to 100%. The terms 'enantiomerically pure'
   and 'diastereomerically pure' should be understood in a similar way, but then having regard to the
   enantiomeric excess, respectively the diastereomeric excess of the mixture in question.
 0 Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates of this invention may be obtained
   by the application of art-known procedures. For instance, enantiomers may be separated from
   each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids
   or bases. Examples thereof are tartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, ditoluoyltartaric acid and
   camphosulfonic acid. Alternatively, enantiomers may be separated by chromatographic
 5 techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also
   be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate
   starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably, if a specific
   stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of
   preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting
 0 materials.
   The diastereomeric forms of formula (I) can be obtained separately by conventional methods.
   Appropriate physical separation methods that may advantageously be employed are, for
   example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column chromatography.
 5
   The present invention is also intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring on the present
   compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass
   numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include
   tritium and deuterium. Isotopes of carbon include C-13 and C-14.

30 Preferred compounds according to the invention are compound or a stereoisomer or tautomeric
   form thereof with a formula selected from table 1.
   In a further aspect, the present invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition comprising a
   therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) as specified
35 herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A prophylactically effective amount in this
   context is an amount sufficient to prevent HBV infection in subjects being at risk of being
   infected. A therapeutically effective amount in this context is an amount sufficient to stabilize
   HBV infection, to reduce HBV infection, or to eradicate HBV infection, in infected subjects. In
   still a further aspect, this invention relates to a process of preparing a pharmaceutical

                                                     -11
   composition as specified herein, which comprises intimately mixing a pharmaceutically
   acceptable carrier with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of
   Formula (I), as specified herein.
 5 Therefore, the compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be formulated
   into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions
   there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To
   prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular
   compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate
 0 admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of
   forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical
   compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration
   orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the
   compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such
 5 as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations
   such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches,
   sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills,
   capsules, and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the
   most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are
 0 employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in
   large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable
   solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose
   solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared
   in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also
 5 included are solid form preparations intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form
   preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally
   comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined
   with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a
   significant deleterious effect on the skin. The compounds of the present invention may also be
30 administered via oral inhalation or insufflation in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry
   powder using any art-known delivery system.
   It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in
   unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used
35 herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a
   predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect
   in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are
   tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, suppositories, powder packets,
   wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.

                                                     -12
   The compounds of Formula (I) are active as inhibitors of the HBV replication cycle and can be
   used in the treatment and prophylaxis of HBV infection or diseases associated with HBV. The
   latter include progressive liver fibrosis, inflammation and necrosis leading to cirrhosis, end-stage
 5 liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
   Due to their antiviral properties, particularly their anti-HBV properties, the compounds of
   Formula (I) or any subgroup thereof, are useful in the inhibition of the HBV replication cycle, in
   particular in the treatment of warm-blooded animals, in particular humans, infected with HBV,
 0 and for the prophylaxis of HBV infections. The present invention furthermore relates to a
   method of treating a warm-blooded animal, in particular human, infected by HBV, or being at
   risk of infection by HBV, said method comprising the administration of a therapeutically
   effective amount of a compound of Formula (I).
 5 The compounds of Formula (I), as specified herein, may therefore be used as a medicine, in
   particular as medicine to treat or prevent HBV infection. Said use as a medicine or method of
   treatment comprises the systemic administration to HBV infected subjects or to subjects
   susceptible to HBV infection of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with
   HBV infection or an amount effective to prevent HBV infection.

   The present invention also relates to the use of the present compounds in the manufacture of a
   medicament for the treatment or the prevention of HBV infection.
   In general it is contemplated that an antiviral effective daily amount would be from about 0.01 to
 5 about 50 mg/kg, or about 0.01 to about 30 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to
   administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals
   throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example,
   containing about I to about 500 mg, or about 1 to about 300 mg, or about I to about 100 mg, or
   about 2 to about 50 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.

   The present invention also concerns combinations of a compound of formula (I) or any subgroup
   thereof, as specified herein with other anti-HBV agents. The term "combination" may relate to a
   product or kit containing (a) a compound of Formula (I), as specified above, and (b) at least one
   other compound capable of treating HBV infection (herein designated as anti-HBV agent), as a
35 combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in treatment of HBV
   infections. In an embodiment, the invention concerns combination of a compound of formula (I)
   or any subgroup thereof with at least one anti-HBV agent. In a particular embodiment, the
   invention concerns combination of a compound of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof with at
   least two anti-HBV agents. In a particular embodiment, the invention concerns combination of a

                                                       -13

 5 GeneralprocedureLCMS methods
   The High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) measurement was performed using a
   LC pump, a diode-array (DAD) or a UV detector and a column as specified in the respective
   methods. If necessary, additional detectors were included (see table of methods below).
   Flow from the column was brought to the Mass Spectrometer (MS) which was configured with
 0 an atmospheric pressure ion source. It is within the knowledge of the skilled person to set the
   tune parameters (e.g. scanning range, dwell time...) in order to obtain ions allowing the
   identification of the compound's nominal monoisotopic molecular weight (MW). Data
   acquisition was performed with appropriate software.
   Compounds are described by their experimental retention times (R1) and ions. If not specified
 5 differently in the table of data, the reported molecular ion corresponds to the [M+H]* (protonated
   molecule) and/or [M-H]- (deprotonated molecule). In case the compound was not directly
   ionizable the type of adduct is specified (i.e. [M+NH 4 ], [M+HCOO]-, etc...). All results were
   obtained with experimental uncertainties that are commonly associated with the method used.

   Biological examples - anti-HBV activity of compounds of Formula (I)
 5 The anti-HBV activity was measured using a stable transfected cell line, HepG2.2.15. This cell
   line was described to secrete relatively consistent high levels of HBV virion particles, which
   have been shown to cause both acute and chronic infection and disease in chimpanzees.
   For the antiviral, assay cells were treated twice for three days with serially diluted compound in
   96-well plates in duplicate. After 6 days of treatment the antiviral activity was determined by
 0 quantification of purified HBV DNA from secreted virions using realtime PCR and an HBV
   specific primer set and probe.
   The anti HBV activity was also measured using the HepG2.117 cell line, a stable, inducibly
   HBV producing cell line, which replicates HBV in the absence of doxicycline (Tet-off system).
   For the antiviral assay, HBV replication was induced, followed by a treatment with serially
 5 diluted compound in 96-well plates in duplicate. After 3 days of treatment, the antiviral activity
   was determined by quantification of intracellular HBV DNA using realtime PCR and an HBV
   specific primer set and probe.
   Cytotoxicity of the compounds was tested using HepG2 cells, incubated for 4 days in the
   presence of compounds. The viability of the cells was assessed using a Resazurin assay. Results
30 are displayed in Table 1.
