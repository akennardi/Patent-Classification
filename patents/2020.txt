   reactants, this method can avoid the environmental pollution of chromium chloride
   and decease the processing cost of pollution in the process of reaction, at the same
   time, avoid the risk of carbon tetrachloride as a toxic liquid to increase the risk
   coefficient of the reaction process so that it meets the requirements of green
20 environmental protection, reduce intermediate links reaction, decrease the reaction
   time and improve the reaction yield, at the same time, the present invention provides a
