  HOT MELT ADHESIVE WITH FUNCTIONALIZED METALLOCENE CATALYZED
                                         POLYOLEFINS
                            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
          The invention is based on the use of metallocene catalyzed polyolefin elastomer
grafted with maleic anhydride (MAH) in hot melt adhesives for applications that require
increased hot tack, adhesion, flexibility, and heat resistance above 150'F.
          Hot melt adhesives are used in packaging applications where it is often required to
adhere to low porosity paper or cardboard which are covered with a wide range of inks,
coatings, and overprint lacquers for functionality or aesthetic purposes. In other instances
they are used to bond low surface energy substrates such as polyethylene (PE) or
polypropylene (PP) films, and to boxes or substrates that vary in physical characteristics such
as the rigidity, density, and chemical make-up due to high level of recycled material. These
type of substrates are very difficult to bond to. As a result, adhesives must be formulated to
overcome these obstacles. Consequently, adhesive formulators are continuously evaluating
new materials and novel formulation strategies in order to develop an adhesive with the
broadest possible application window. An adhesive's application window is defined as an
adhesive's ability to overcome an application's deficiencies and/or manufacturing variables.
The current invention details a novel way a hot melt formulator can balance the adhesive's
application window without adversely affecting the high temperature              environmental
resistance and adhesion to the substrates.
          Historically, adhesive formulators have struggled to formulate a crystalline,
polyolefin based adhesive or an EVA based adhesive that could provide heat environmental
resistance above 150'F while maintaining the hot tack and/or cold temperature performance.
In order to increase the heat resistance over 150'F, typically a styrenic block copolymer
based polymer is used. In particular they have fully hydrogenated midblocks, such as Kraton
G1657. They can be used to increase the heat resistance properties of the adhesive while
maintaining adequate compatibility with the polyolefin base polymer. Another approach is to
                                                 1

    WO 2015/048343                                                            PCT/US2014/057540
use a high level of polymer (for example, greater than 30%) to increase the heat resistance
while maintaining the cold temperature resistance. However, these approaches drive the
viscosity of the adhesive significantly higher and it becomes unsuitable for the intended
applications.
           Adhesives have been used for years to label both glass and plastic bottles. Plastic
bottles containing carbonated beverages are particularly challenging.               After bottling,
carbonated beverages will cause plastic bottles to expand.            The label system needs to
accommodate this expansion. The adhesive used to adhere the label onto the plastic bottle
also needs to accommodate this expansion.
           Paper labels are rigid and will not expand. Typically, hard, glassy adhesives are
used to bond the paper label to glass bottles. When paper labels are used on plastic bottles,
the adhesive needs to resist creep, and thus prevent the label from "flagging" (partial
delamination of the label overlap from the bottle).       However, plastic labels are flexible and
will expand and are generally more difficult to adhere to than the paper labels. Typically,
softer, elastic, tacky adhesives are used on plastic film labels. The adhesive used to adhere
plastic labels needs to be of sufficient tack to adhere the label to the bottle, and strong enough
to withstand the expansion of the label and the bottle.          In this type of application, the
adhesive needs to have a greater internal strength than that of the label.          The adhesives'
increased internal strength forces the label to stretch and expand, maintaining the bond at the
label overlap. Should the adhesive stretch or creep a gap will appear between the leading and
trailing edge of the label on the bottle at the label overlap.
          Plastic labels are becoming more rigid in order to support increased graphics and
facilitate the printing process. Additionally, plastic bottles are experiencing an overall gauge
reduction to achieve cost savings and meet manufacturers' "green" initiatives. Also, clear
labels are also entering the market place. These labels, due to their base composition, have
greater tensile strength than previous plastic labels.      The greater tensile strength of these
labels resists stretching, causing existing adhesives to creep, resulting in a labeling failure
(the label's leading and trailing edges separate). Furthermore, some plastic film labels are
                                                  2

    WO 2015/048343                                                         PCT/US2014/057540
susceptible to oil migration from the adhesive into the label.           This migration causes
aesthetically unpleasing wrinkles.
          Adhesive formulators are struggling to develop adhesives that adhere well to these
higher tensile strength plastic labels, and do not exhibit oil migration from the adhesive into
the label at 140'F. This invention details a novel way a hot melt formulator can impart low
viscosity, superior adhesion, increased creep resistance, and no oil migration in hot melt
bottle labeling adhesives, without compromising other properties.
          There has been a need for hot melt adhesives with increased temperature resistance
for "hot fill" applications. This is where a liquid food product (juice, tea, etc.) is heated to a
temperature of about 190'F to sterilize it. The liquid is placed in a plastic or glass container
while hot which serves to sterilize the package as well. It is immediately capped, which helps
provide a vacuum as the liquid cools. Once capped it is quickly cooled to minimize the effect
of heat on the liquid. The label may be applied before the container is completely cooled and
therefore requires increased temperature resistance so that the label does not detach from the
bottle.
          There is also a need for "hot fill" applications involving carton sealing. Besides hot
fill label applications, there are other times when hot materials are put into a shipping
container while still hot. This can cause the hot melt adhesive to soften to the point that the
bond delaminates. Clearly, there is a need for hot melt adhesives with better heat resistance in
a number of areas.
          Over the years, adhesive formulators have utilized a variety of different polymers as
well as other additives in their formulations to obtain a balance of these attributes (adhesion,
creep resistance, flexibility, and heat environmental resistance). These polymers include, but
are not limited to polyolefins (ethylene- or propene- based polymers), functionalized
polyolefins (ethylene or propene copolymers with oxygen containing monomers), or APAOs
(ethylene-, propene-, or butene copolymers).        However, when formulated into hot melt
adhesives, these polymers had certain performance deficiencies. For example, due to their
overall wide molecular weight distribution and/or significant low molecular weight portion as
                                                3

    WO 2015/048343                                                        PCT/US2014/057540
observed by various analytical testing methods, APAOs can provide flexibility but can
hamper bonding performance at elevated temperatures above 120'F.                 In fact, their
amorphous, non-crystalline structure can often lead to blocking. Blocking is defined as the
undesired adhesion of a coated adhesive to substrates it comes into contact with during
shipping and/or storage.
          In addition to ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) polymers other polymers have also been
utilized in an attempt to improve an adhesive's hot tack and adhesion characteristics. These
polymers include, but are not limited to ethylene methyl acrylate copolymers (EMA),
ethylene n-butyl acrylate (EnBA), and ethylene methyl acrylate acrylic acid copolymers.
These polymers exhibit narrower poly-dispersity when compared to olefin polymers, such as
APAO and have lower overall melt peaks as observed by DSC (Differential Scanning
Calorimetry). This results in an adhesive that is prone to blocking or bond failure at elevated
temperatures if not reinforced with some other crystalline additive. While the incorporation
of certain waxes or other crystalline additives can increase the elevated temperature
resistance of the adhesive, they can reduce the adhesive's hot tack, adhesion, and flexibility.
          Adhesive formulators may incorporate other additives or diluents including but not
limited to various plasticizers, microcrystalline waxes, and vinyl acetate or maleic anhydride
modified waxes to promote adhesion and flexibility. However, these types of formulations
typically have insufficient heat resistance above 150'F.
                              SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
          The present invention relates to hot melt adhesives utilizing a functionalized
metallocene catalyzed polyolefin elastomer. More specifically, the composition of the present
invention is based on the use of a metallocene catalyzed polyolefin elastomer grafted with
maleic anhydride (MAH) functionality in hot melt adhesives for applications that require
increased hot tack, adhesion, flexibility, and heat resistance above 150'F.
          The invention details hot melt adhesive formulations, consisting of liquid or solid
plastizicer, wax, tackifying resin, and metallocene catalyzed polyolefin elastomers grafted

    WO 2015/048343                                                            PCT/US2014/057540
with maleic anhydride (MAH).           These formulations provide superior hot tack, excellent
adhesion characteristics, flexibility, and heat environmental resistance above 150 F, and even
above 160 0 F, over traditional EVA based adhesives, or other polyolefin elastomer based
adhesives. The hot melt formulations of this invention also demonstrate improved adhesion to
hard-to-bond substrates, such as clear label films, over traditional ethylene vinyl acetate
(EVA) based hot melt adhesives. The present adhesive composition may be used specifically
for, but is not limited to, rigid packaging applications, hot fill packaging applications, bottle
labeling applications, multiwall bag applications, non-structural assembly applications,
graphic arts applications, craft, and/or floral applications.

    WO 2015/048343                                                       PCT/US2014/057540
to or less than about 15,000 centipoise at 163 0 C, and more preferably equal to or less than
about 10,000 centipoise at 163 0 C.
           In a prefered embodiment, the composition may also include about 1% to about
25% by weight of an auxiliary polymer selected from the group consisting of metallocene
catalyzed polyolefin elastomers, propylene or ethylene based copolymers, ethylene-alpha

          Use of the term "functionalized" herein refers to polymers which are chemically
modified so as to contain the functional group anhydride on the polymer backbone. In
contrast, the term "non-functionalized" refers to polymers which are not chemically modified
so as to contain functional groups such as epoxy, silane, sulfonate, amide, and particularly
anhydride, on the polymer backbone.
                     Polyolefin polymers are produced with a very wide range of molecular
weights, monomers, densities, crystallinity levels, and functionality. Metallocene catalyzed
polyolefin elastomers grafted with maleic anhydride (MAH), offer excellent adhesive
characteristics and most importantly provide increased heat environmental resistance (above
 150OF and even above 160'F), increase flexibility, and excellent adhesion to hard to bond
substrates. These MAH grafted polymers can be used as the primary polymer in a hot melt
adhesive formulation or can be used as a secondary polymer to provide well balanced
adhesive attributes (excellent adhesion, increased flexibility, low viscosity, and heat
resistance above 150'F).       An example of these metallocene polymers includes Affinity@
GA1OOR from Dow Chemical Company. This polymer has a density of 0.878 grams/c.c., a
DSC melting point of 68'C and a Glass Transition Temperature of -58'C via DSC.            The
Brookfield Viscosity at 177'C is 13,000 centipoise (cP) and the Melt Index (ASTM 1238
with 190'C, 2.16 kg weight) is about 660 grams/10 minutes.
         The composition also includes, as the secondary polymer, a metallocene catalyzed
random or block polyolefin elastomer. The polyolefin elastomer may be polypropylene or
                                               6

    WO 2015/048343                                                         PCT/US2014/057540
polyethylene, blends of different polypropylenes, blends of different polyethylenes, or blends
of polypropylenes with polyethylenes.
          The polyolefin elastomer secondary polymer may be incorporated into the
composition in amounts of from about 5% to about 70% by weight, preferably from about
20% to about 70% by weight, and more preferably from about 30% to about 70% by weight,
and most preferably from about 30% to about 60% by weight.
          The elastomeric secondary polymer may be a suitable metallocene catalyzed
ethylene-based copolymer comprising a major portion by weight of ethylene and a minor
portion by weight of a C3 to Cis alpha-olefin comonomer, or a metallocene catalyzed
propylene-based copolymer comprising a major portion by weight of propylene and a minor
portion by weight of a C2 to Cis alpha-olefin comonomer, or a blend of the ethylene-based
copolymers, the propylene-based copolymers, or one or more of the ethylene-based
copolymers with one or more of the propylene-based copolymers.                The alpha-olefin
comonomer preferably contains 3 to 12 carbon atoms, more preferably contains 4 to 10
carbon atoms, and most preferably contains 4 to 8 carbon atoms.          More particularly, the
alpha-olefin comonomer may be selected from 1-butene, 1-pentene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 3
methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-dodecene, 3-methyl-1-hexene, 1-octene,
and I -decene. Particularly preferred is I -butene or I -octene copolymerized with ethylene.
          The alpha-olefin comonomer content in the ethylene-based copolymer is at least
20% by weight and in the range of from 20% to 50% by weight, preferably from 250%to 50%
by weight, more preferably from 30% to 50% by weight.                  Suitable ethylene-based
copolymers have a density as determined by ASTM D-792 of 0.90g/cm 3 or less and in the
range of from 0.90g/cm3 to 0.85g/cm3 , preferably between 0.89g/cm3 and 0.85g/cm3 , and
most preferably between 0.885g/cm 3 and 0.85g/cm 3 . Suitable ethylene-based copolymers
also have a melt index at 190'C and 2.16 kg as determined by ASTM D1238 of greater than
 15 g/10 min. preferably greater than 20 g/10 min., and more preferably greater than 30 g/10
min.
          The alpha-olefin comonomer content in the propylene-based copolymer is at least
5%, preferably 5% to    3 0%, and most preferably 5% to 15% by weight, and the preferred
copolymer is a propylene-ethylene copolymer. The propylene-based copolymers have a melt
index (measured at 230'C) of more than 15 g/10 min., preferably more than 20 g/10 min.,
                                                 7

    WO 2015/048343                                                           PCT/US2014/057540
more preferably greater than 30 g/10 min., and most preferably greater than 50 g/10 min., or
more than 100 g/10 min.
          "Blends" preferably comprise two or more ethylene-based copolymers or two or
more propylene-based copolymers, or one or more ethylene-based copolymers with one or
more propylene-based copolymers.        Where a blend of copolymers is used, the calculated
density of the blend should be less than 0.900 g/cm 3 , but greater than 0.850 g/cm 3 . For
example, a blend of 70% of an ethylene-based copolymer having a density of 0.870 g/cm 3
and 30% of a propylene-based copolymer having a density of 0.885 g/cm 3 will result in a
final blend having a calculated density of 0.875 g/cm3 .
          Useful metallocene catalyzed ethylene-based polymers are available from, among
others, Dow Chemical Company and Exxon Mobil Chemical Company who are producers of
single site or constrained geometry catalyzed polyethylenes. These resins are commercially
available under the tradenames AFFINITY TM and ENGAGE TM from Dow Chemical Co. and
EXACT TM polymers from ExxonMobil Chemical.
          The metallocene catalyzed propylene-based copolymers are available under the
VERSIFYTM tradename from The Dow Chemical Company.                     The manufacture of such
polypropylenes is also based on using a metallocene catalyst system and is based on Dow's
INSITE TM technology.
          The ratio of the primary or base polymer, namely, the metallocene catalyzed random
polyolefin elastomer grafted with maleic anhydride to the secondary polymer can vary
depending on the physical properties and the adhesion required by the finished adhesive
formulation. For example, the ratio can be varied to increase or decrease (i) the elasticity of the
adhesive composition; (ii) the adhesion of the adhesive composition; (iii) the low temperature
resistance of the adhesive composition; (iv) the high temperature resistance of the adhesive
composition; (v) the creep resistance of the adhesive composition; (vi) the cohesive strength of
the adhesive composition; (viii) the viscosity characteristics of the adhesive composition and/or
(ix) the aging characteristics of the adhesive composition. The relative change (increase or
decrease) of the above characteristics is measured relative to the adhesive composition without
the addition of the secondary polymer.       In general, the percentage of the primary or base
polymer will be lower than the amount of the secondary polymer(s) in the formulation.
          An important consideration when selecting the secondary polymer is the molecular
weight of the secondary polymer and its impact on the viscosity of the finished adhesive.
                                                 8

   WO 2015/048343                                                           PCT/US2014/057540
Since these types of formulations generally contain fairly high levels of polymer, it is
important that the melt index be relatively high to keep the viscosity of the finished adhesive
low. The melt index of the secondary polymer as measured by ASTM D-1238 using a test
temperature of 190'C and a weight of 2.16 kilograms should be greater than 15 grams per
minute (g/min). Preferably it is greater than 30 g/min, more preferably greater than 50 g/min,
and most preferably it is greater than 100 g/min. When using a blend of secondary polymers,
the calculated melt index of the blend should be within these ranges.
          The tackifying resins or tackifiers which are used in the hot melt adhesives of the
present invention are those which are compatible with the polymers and extend adhesive
properties and improve specific adhesion.       As used herein, the term "tackifying resin" or
"tackifier" include:
          (a)   Aliphatic and cycloaliphatic petroleum hydrocarbon resins having Ring and
Ball softening points of from about 203OF (95 0 C) to about 320OF (160 0 C), as determined by
ASTM method E28-58T, the latter resins resulting from the polymerization of monomers
consisting primarily of aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic olefins and diolefins; also included are
the hydrogenated aliphatic and cycloaliphatic petroleum hydrocarbon resins; examples of
such commercially available resins based on a C5 olefin fraction of this type are Piccotac 95
tackifying resin sold by Hercules Corp. and Escorez 13 1OLC sold by ExxonMobil Chemical
Company;
          (b)   Aromatic petroleum hydrocarbon resins and the hydrogenated derivatives
thereof;
          (c)   Aliphatic/aromatic     petroleum    derived    hydrocarbon     resins  and    the
hydrogenated derivatives thereof;
          (d)   Aromatic modified cycloaliphatic resins and the hydrogenated derivatives
thereof;
          (e)   Polyterpene resins having a softening point of from about 203OF (95 0 C) to
about 284OF (140 0 C), the latter polyterpene resins generally resulting from the polymerization
of terpene hydrocarbons, such as the mono-terpene known as pinene, in the presence of
Friedel-Crafts catalysts at moderately low temperatures; also included are the hydrogenated
polyterpene resins;
          (f)   Copolymers and terpolymers of natural terpenes, e.g. styrene/terpene, a
methyl styrene/terpene and vinyl toluene/terpene;

    WO 2015/048343                                                         PCT/US2014/057540
           (g)    Natural and modified rosin such as, for example, gun rosin, wood rosin, tall
oil rosin, distilled rosin, hydrogenated rosin, dimerized rosin and polymerized rosin;
           (h)    Glycerol and pentaerythritol esters of natural and modified rosin, such as, for
example, the glycerol ester of pale wood rosin, the glycerol ester of hydrogenated rosin, the
glycerol ester of polymerized rosin, the pentaerythritol ester of pale wood rosin, the
pentaerythritol ester of hydrogenated rosin, the pentaerythritol ester of tall-oil rosin, and the
phenolic modified pentaerythritol ester of rosin;
            (i)   Phenolic-modified terpene resins such as, for example, the resin product
 resulting from the condensation in an acidic medium of a terpene and a phenol;
            Mixtures of two or more of the above described tackifying resins may be required
for some formulations. Although a range of 20% to 70% by weight tackifying resin may be
used, the preferred amount is from about 25% to about 65% by weight, a more preferred
amount is from about 25% to about 50% by weight, and the most preferred amount is from
about 30% to about 50% by weight. Tackifying resins which are useful for the present
invention can perhaps include polar tackifying resins. However, the choice of available polar
tackifying resins is limited in view of the fact that many of the polar resins appear only
partially compatible with polyolefin polymers.
            As noted above, tackifying resins which are useful within the scope of the present
invention comprise about 20% to 70% by weight of the composition. Preferably, the
tackifying resins can be selected from any of the nonpolar types, which are commercially
available. One class of preferred resins are aliphatic petroleum hydrocarbon resins examples
of which are based on C5 olefins. Most preferred are nonpolar products which are
hydrogenated di-cyclo-penta-diene       (DCPD) based or aromatically modified derivatives
thereof with softening points above 95 0 C. Examples of such resins are Escorez 5340, Escorez
5400 and Escorez 5600 sold by ExxonMobil Chemical company.
           Preferably the tackifying resin should have a Ring and Ball softening point
(measured by ASTM E28) of at least about 95 0 C, and preferably between about 95'C and
about 140'C.       In general the tackifying resin should be substantially aliphatic to insure
compatibility between the resin and the polyolefin polymers.
           A solid or liquid plasticizer can be present in the composition of the present
invention in amounts of 0% to about 30% by weight, preferably from 0% to about 10% by
weight, and most preferably from 0% to about 5% by weight, in order to provide desired

viscosity control and to impart flexibility. A suitable plasticizer may be selected from the
group which includes the usual plasticizing oils, such as mineral oil, but also olefin oligomers
and low molecular weight polymers, as well as vegetable and animal oils and derivatives of
such oils. The petroleum derived oils which may be employed are relatively high boiling
materials containing only a minor proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons. In this regard, the
aromatic hydrocarbons should preferably be less than 30% and more particularly less than
 15% of the oil, as measured by the fraction of aromatic carbon atoms. More preferably, the
oil may be essentially non-aromatic. The oligomers may be polypropylenes, polybutenes,
hydrogenated polyisoprenes, hydrogenated polybutadiens, or the like having average
molecular weight between about 350 and about 10,000. Suitable vegetable and animal oils
include glycerol esters of the usual fatty acids and polymerization products thereof. The
plasticizers that find usefulness in the present invention can be any number of different
plasticizers but the inventors have discovered that the mineral oil and liquid polybutenes
having average molecular weight less than 5,000 are particularly advantageous. As will be
appreciated, plasticizers have typically been used to lower the viscosity of the overall
adhesive composition without substantially decreasing the adhesive strength and/or the
service temperature of the adhesive as well as to extend the open time and to improve
flexibility of the adhesive. For end use applications such as case and carton seal or multiwall
bag sealing, there will typical be no plasticizer used in the adhesive. However, a plasticizer
will typically be incorporated into a hot melt adhesive intended for use in bottle labeling
applications.
           Waxes in amounts of about 5% to about 30% by weight, preferably from about 5%
to about 20% by weight, and most preferably from about 5% to about 10% by weight, can
also be used in the adhesive composition, and are used to reduce the melt viscosity of the hot
melt adhesives without appreciably decreasing their adhesive bonding characteristics. These
waxes also are used to reduce the open time, or set-up time, of the composition without
affecting the temperature performance.
           Among the useful wax materials are:
                (1) low molecular weight, that is, number average molecular weight (Mn) of
about 100 to about 6000 g/mol, polyethylene wax having a hardness value, as determined by
ASTM method D-1321, of from about 0.1 to 120 and ASTM softening points of from about
 150OF (65'C) to 285OF (140'C);

               (2) petroleum waxes such as paraffin wax having a melting point of from
about 122 0F (50 0 C) to about 176 0F (80 0 C) and microcrystalline wax having a melting point of
from about 131'F (55 0 C) to about 212OF (100 0 C), the latter melting points being determined
by ASTM method D127-60;
                (3) metallocene catalyzed propylene-based wax like those commercialized by
Clariant under the name "Licocene";
                (4) metallocene catalyzed wax or single-site catalyzed wax like for example
those described in U.S. Patents 4,914,253, 6,319,979 or WO 97/33921 or WO 98/03603;
                 (5)  synthetic waxes made by polymerizing carbon monoxide and hydrogen
such as Fischer-Tropsch wax; and
                (6) polyolefin waxes. As used herein, the term "polyolefin wax" refers to those
polymeric or long-chain entities comprised of olefinic monomer units.          These materials are
commercially available from Westlake Chemical Co. under the trade name "Epolene."
         The wax materials which are preferred to use in the compositions of the present
invention have a Ring and Ball softening point of about 200OF (93 0 C) to about 350OF (177 0 C).
As should be understood, each of these waxes is solid at room temperature.           Other useful
substances include hydrogenated animal, fish and vegetable fats and oils such as hydrogenated
tallow, lard, soy oil, cottonseed oil, castor oil, menhadin oil, cod liver oil, and the like, and
which are solid at ambient temperature by virtue of their being hydrogenated, have also been
found to be useful with respect to functioning as a wax material equivalent. These hydrogenated
materials are often referred to in the adhesives industry as "animal or vegetable waxes".
           In another embodiment, the adhesive formula may contain a fully aromatic
or a substantially fully aromatic endblock reinforcing resin. The aromatic or
substantially fully aromatic resin should have softening point equal to or higher than
221 F (1 15'C). Examples of such endblock resins can be prepared from any
substantially aromatic monomers having a polymerizable unsaturated group. Typical
examples of such aromatic monomers include the styrenic monomers, styrene,
alphamethyl styrene, vinyl toluene, methoxy styrene, tertiary butyl styrene,
chlorostyrene, etc., coumarone, indene monomers including indene, and methyl
indene. The Ring and Ball Softening Points of the aromatic endblock resin is
preferably between 1150 and 160'C. More preferably, the softening point is between
                                                  12

    WO 2015/048343                                                         PCT/US2014/057540
about 1150 and 140'C and most preferably between about 120'C and 140'C. Two
preferred examples are Plastolyn 240 and Plastolyn 290 available from Eastman
Chemical. They have Ring and Ball Softening Points of 120'C and 140'C,
respectively. Preferably, styrene and/or alpha-methyl-styrene and/or vinyl-toluene
monomers are used. This reinforcing resin may be present in amounts of 0% to about
20% by weight, i.e. under about 20% by weight, in the adhesive composition, and
when incorporated in the composition should preferably be between 1% to about 10%
by weight.
           The present invention may include a stabilizer in an amount of from about 0% to
about 5% by weight. Preferably from about 0.1% to 5% of a stabilizer is incorporated into
the composition. The stabilizers which are useful in the hot melt adhesive compositions of
the present invention are incorporated to help protect the polymers noted above, and thereby
the total adhesive system, from the effects of thermal and oxidative degradation which
normally occurs during the manufacture and application of the adhesive as well as in the
ordinary exposure of the final product to the ambient environment. Among the applicable
stabilizers are high molecular weight hindered phenols and multifunction phenols, such as
sulfur and phosphorous-containing phenols.          Hindered phenols are well known to those
skilled in the art and may be characterized as phenolic compounds that also contain sterically
bulky radicals in close proximity to the phenolic hydroxyl group thereof. In particular,
tertiary butyl groups generally are substituted onto the benzene ring in at least one of the
ortho positions relative to the phenolic hydroxyl group. The presence of these sterically
bulky substituted radicals in the vicinity of the hydroxyl group serves to retard its stretching
frequency and correspondingly, its reactivity; this steric hindrance thus providing the
phenolic compound with its stabilizing properties. Representative hindered phenols include:
           1,3,5-trimethyl-2,4,6-tris(3-5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl) benzene;
          pentaerythirtol tetrakis-3(3,5-di-tert-butly-4-hydroxyphenyl) propionate;

          2-(n-octylthio)ethyl-3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoate; and
          sorbitol hexa-3(3,5-di-tet-butyl-4-hydroxy-phenyl) propionate.
          Especially preferred as a stabilizer is pentaerythritol tetrakis-3(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4
hydroxyphenol) propionate.
          The performance of these stabilizers may be further enhanced by utilizing, in
conjunction therewith; (1) synergists such as, for example, thiodipropionate esters and
phosphites;    examples    of   these    include    dilauryl  thiodipropionate    (DLTDP)     and
tris(nonylphenyl) phosphite (TNPP), respectively;          and (2) chelating agents and metal
deactivators    as,  for  example,     ethylenediamenetetraacitic    acid,  slats   thereof,  and
disalicylalpropylenediimine.
          It should be understood that other optional auxiliary additives in amounts of 0% to
3% may be incorporated into the adhesive composition of the present invention in order to
modify particular physical properties. These may include, for example, inert colorants such
as titanium dioxide, as well as fillers, surfactants, other types of polymers, crosslinking
agents, nucleating agents, reactive compounds, fire-retardant mineral or organic agents,
ultraviolet (UV) or infrared (IR) light absorbing agents, and UV or IR fluorescing agents.
Typical fillers include talc, calcium carbonate, clay, silica, mica, wollastonite, feldspar,
aluminum silicate, alumina, hydrated alumina, glass microspheres, ceramic microspheres,
thermoplastic microspheres, baryte and wood flour. These optional auxiliary additives are
well known in this art.
          In a prefered embodiment, the composition may also include about 1% to about
25% by weight of an auxiliary polymer selected from the group consisting of metallocene
catalyzed polyolefin elastomers, propylene or ethylene based copolymers, ethylene-alpha
olefin copolymers, olefin block copolymers, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), ethylene n-butytl
acrylate copolymers, and styrenic block copolymers.
          A styrenic block copolymer can be used in a hot melt adhesive formula according to
the present invention, and may be incorporated into the composition in amounts of from
about 1% to about 25% by weight, preferably from about 1% to about 20% by weight, and
most preferably from about 1% to about 10% by weight. Among the useful styrenic block
copolymers are those having structure A-B, A-B-A, A-(B-A).-B, or (A-B)-Y wherein A
comprises a polyvinyl aromatic block having a Tg higher than 80 0 C, B comprises a rubbery
midblock having a Tg lower than -10 0 C, Y comprises a multivalent compound, and n is an

integer of at least 3. Examples of these latter block copolymers that are useful in the present
hot melt adhesive composition are styrenic block copolymers (SBc) and include styrene
ethylene-butylene-styrene    (SEBS),    styrene-ethylene-butylene    (SEB)    styrene-ethylene
propylene-styrene (SEPS) and styrene-ethylene propylene (SEP) and styrene-ethylene
ethylene-propylene-styrene (SEEPS or hydrogenated SIBS) . The total styrene content of the
polymers can be as much as about 30 wt-% of the polymer. Hydrogenating the butadiene
midblocks produces rubbery midblocks that are typically converted to ethylene-butylene
midblocks.     Such block copolymers are available for example from Kraton Polymers,
Polimeri Europa, Total Petrochemicals, Dexco, and Kuraray. Multiblock or tapered block
copolymers (the A-(B-A).-B type) are available from Firestone. Block copolymers structures
can contain any acrylic monomers or acrylic phase in general, either presenting a high Tg like
methyl methacrylate, or having an elastomeric behavior like butyl acrylate.          Also, the
polymer fraction of the hot melt adhesive can contain one or more other phases, can contain
more than one structure or can contain other polymers like copolymers of ethene, propene or
other olefinic monomer, or like copolymerization of acrylic monomers. These additional
polymers can be homopolymers, or copolymers and can be potentially modified by any
during- or after-polymerization modification like grafting or chain-scission.        Blends of
various styrenic polymers may also be employed so long as the composition retains the
desired viscosity, adhesion, flexibility, and heat resistance characteristics of the present
invention.
          Olefin block copolymers are a class of polyolefin polymer produced using a chain
shuttling catalysis technology that produces a linear block structure of the monomers rather
than a random polymer produced by Ziegler-Natta or traditional metallocene technology. At
this time, they are manufactured by Dow Chemical under the trade name of Infuse@. The
OBC's consist of crystallizable ethylene-octene blocks (hard) with very low comonomer
content and high melting temperature alternating with amorphous ethylene-octene blocks
(soft) with high comonomer content and low glass transition temperature.        This gives the
polymer much better elevated temperature resistance and elasticity compared to a typical
metallocene random polymer of similar density. While some of the grades of Infuse@ have
low heat of fusion (approximately 20 Joules/gram) they could not be considered to be
amorphous poly-alpha-olefins because the polymer architecture is completely different (i.e.
block vs. random) and is specifically produced to have crystalline regions. Not only are they

different on a structural basis, they are very different from a physical property standpoint
with the OBC's having better elastic recovery, compression set and elevated temperature
resistance. As such, they are sold into different markets for different end uses and are not
considered equivalent for one another.
          OBCs are well known in the art. Details of their synthesis and physical properties
can be found in, for example, WO 2006/101966, WO 2006/102016, WO 2006/102150, WO
2009/029476 and US 7,524,911, the disclosures of which are specifically incorporated herein
by reference.     As is known in the art, the density of the OBC is directly related to its
crystallinity, i.e. the higher the density the higher the percent crystallinity. OBC's useful in
the present hot melt adhesive composition have densities ranging from 0.860 g/cm 3 to 0.890
g/cm3 (g/cc) and a melt index of Ig/10 min. to 1000 g/l0min, preferably Ig/10 min to
 1OOg/10 min. as measured according to ASTM D1238 at 190'C with a 2.16 kg weight.
          Blends of two or more OBC polymers may also be used. For example, a blend of a
first OBC polymer and a second OBC polymer that is different than the first OBC polymer
may be employed.
          OBC polymers are commercially available from Dow Chemical Company under the
tradename "InfuseTM" in different grades which are distinguishable primarily based on their
density and weight percent crystallinity, namely, Infuse 9817, Infuse 9807, Infuse 9530,
Infuse 9500 and Infuse 9507.
          The hot melt adhesive composition of the present invention may be formulated by
using any of the mixing techniques known in the art. A representative example of the prior art
mixing procedure involves placing all the components, except the polymers, in a jacketed
mixing kettle, such as a jacketed heavy duty mixer of the Baker-Perkins or Day type,
equipped with a rotor, and thereafter raising the temperature of the mixture to a range from
248OF (120 0 C) to 400OF (205 0 C) to melt the contents. It should be understood that the precise
temperature to be used in this step would depend on the melting points of the particular
ingredients. The polymers are subsequently introduced to the kettle under agitation and the
mixing is allowed to continue until a consistent and uniform mixture is formed. The content
of the kettle is protected with inert gas such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen during the entire
mixing process, and a vacuum may be applied to remove any entrapped gases, particularly
air.

          The viscosity of the adhesive composition of the present invention is equal to or
lower than 20,000 centipoise (cP) at 325'F (163'C). Preferably, it should be lower than
 15,000 centipoise (cP) at 325'F (163'C), and most preferably should be lower than 10,000
centipoise (cP) at 325 0 F (163 0 C) as determined by employing a Brookfield Thermocel or
other appropriate viscometer and utilizing the testing techniques which are set forth in ASTM
Method D3236-88. The viscosity of the finished adhesive can vary widely depending on the
end use of the adhesive.        For example, hot melt adhesives used for bottle labeling
applications are generally quite low in viscosity, for example less than about 2,000 centipoise
(cP) at 325'F, and more preferably less than 1,000 centipoise (cP) at 325 0 F. On the other
hand, hot melts used for case and carton sealing are typically less than about 10,000
centipoise (cP) at 325'F.
                                         EXAMPLES
          Two tests were used to assess the elevated temperature resistance of             hot melt
adhesive composition samples. The first is a Mandrel Test and the second is an Institute of
Packaging Professionals (IOPP) Test.
          In order to perform the Mandrel Test, two strips of a 42 pound/ream kraft paper are
required. One piece should be cut to 3 inches x 6 inches and the second is cut to 1 inch x 6
inches. A bead of adhesive of about 1/8 inch in diameter is applied lengthwise down the
center of the 3 inch x 6 inch piece at the typical application temperature of 350 0 F. After a 2
second open time, the 1 inch x 6 inch piece is placed on top of the bead of adhesive and
compressed using a standard 4.5 pound PSTC (Pressure Sensitive Tape Council) roller by
rolling over the adhesive bead once. The test sample is allowed to age overnight at room
temperature.
          After aging,  12 inch of the laminate is cut from each end to ensure that there is no
adhesive squeezed out which could effect the bond. The laminate is taped, top and bottom, to
the outside of a standard 3 inch ID core. The only thing holding the outer 1 inch x 5 inch
piece of Kraft paper in place is the bead of adhesive. Samples are placed in enviromental
chambers at various temperatures (140 0 F, 150 0 F, 160 0 F, etc.) for 24 hours. After 24 hours has
elapsed, the samples are checked while still in the chamber for delamination. The percent
delamination is noted along with the failure mode. If the sample is still bonded, it is peeled
apart by hand to determine the amount of fiber tear.

          Samples were also evaluated by an IOPP Test, known in the industry as "Suggested
Test Method For Determining The Heat Stress Resistance Of Hot Melt Adhesives". In this
test, two samples of corrugated board are glued together with a hot melt adhesive. The test is
orientated to mimic a case flap under stress. Test samples are placed in an isothermal oven
for 24 hours at 140 0F. The bond on the test samples is evaluated as pass or fail with the
failure mode noted. A more detailed description of the IOPP Test can be found in the
Packaging Adhesives and Adhesion Committee (PAAT) Committee Reports of the Institute
of Packaging Professionals at www.iopp.org.
          The Examples in Tables       1A, 1B and IC demonstrate the heat resistance
performance advantages as a result of the incorporation of functionalized polyolefin
elastomers grafted with maleic anhydride. The compositions labeled PA-1 and PA-2 are
commercial hot melt adhesives used in case and carton sealing applications and are available
from Bostik, Inc. while Comparative samples 1 through 13 show various formulations based
on blends of non-functionalized metallocene catalyzed polyolefin (Affinity GA1900). None
of these pass the Mandrel Test at 160OF for 24 hours. Comparing Comparative sample 13
with Inventive sample 1, the Inventive sample 1 containing the maleic modified polyolefin
polymer (Affinity GA1000R) has dramatically improved elevated temperature properties.
The same is true comparing Comparative sample 14 with Inventive sample 2, and
Comparative sample 15 with Inventive sample 3. It is important to note that the viscosity
does not significantly change by adding the maleic modified polymer. Surprisingly, the Ring
and Ball softening point does not increase even though the Inventive samples have much
higher heat resistance properties.
          Table 2 shows several examples to evaluate the bond force using a standard 180
Degree Peel Test measured using an Instron Tensile Tester with a crosshead speed of 12
inches/minute at room temperature on hard to bond clear label films. Hard to bond clear label
films include films such as clear polypropylene, polyethylene, polypropylene/polyethylene,
or metalized oriented polypropylene label films. The composition labeled PA-3 is a
commercial hot melt adhesive used in bottle labelling applications and is available from
Bostik, Inc. Comparing PA-3 and Inventive sample 3, it is clear that Inventive sample 3
provides much higher peel force on a polypropylene film label. Also, it should be noted that
comparing compositions PA-3 and Comp. 1 with inventive examples Inv. 1, Inv.2 and Inv.3,
