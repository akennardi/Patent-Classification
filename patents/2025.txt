                                                FIELD
   [0001]          The present disclosure relates generally to shutters for architectural openings
   and, more particularly, to a louvered shutter for an architectural opening.
 5                                        BACKGROUND
   [0002]          Louvered shutters for architectural openings, such as doors, windows, and the
   like, have taken numerous forms for many years. Louvered shutters generally provide
   adjustable light and privacy control through the inclusion of multiple rotatable louvers. In
   operation, consumers may rotate the louvers to a desired position that provides a preferred
 0 amount of light and privacy.
                                             SUMMARY

 5                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [0064]          The present disclosure relates to a shutter panel for an architectural opening.
   The shutter panel may include one or more rotatable louvers. For shutter panels with
   multiple louvers, the louvers may be linked together by a tilt bar, a gear track system, a pulley
   system, or another operating system. To move the louvers, a force may be applied directly to
 0 a louver or indirectly to a louver through the operating system.
   [0065]          The shutter panel may include a closure feature. For example, during rotation
   of a louver toward a closed position, the louver may be automatically closed after reaching a
   certain angular orientation. The automatic closure of the louver may occur without user
   actuation or interaction. The automatic closure of the louver may ensure a full panel closure,
 5 thereby addressing any stacked tolerance issues with the shutter panel.
   [00661          The shutter panel may include a closure device operably associated with the
   louver and configured to move the louver. The closure device may be actuated based on an
   angular orientation of the louver relative to a fully closed position. In some implementations,
   the closure device is actuated based on the louver being oriented between about 1 degree and
 O about 30 degrees from a fully closed position. In some implementations, the closure device is
   actuated based on the louver being oriented between about 10 degrees and about 20 degrees
   from a fully closed position. In some implementations, the closure device is actuated based
   on the louver being oriented at about 15 degrees from a fully closed position. Upon
   actuation, the closure device may drive or rotate the louver into the fully closed position.
25 [00671          Additionally or alternatively, the shutter panel may include a damping feature.
   For example, during rotation of a louver toward a closed position, the rate of louver rotation
   may be automatically damped after the louver reaches a certain angular orientation. The
   automatic damping of the rate of motion of the louver may occur without user actuation or
   interaction. The automatic damping of the rate of louver motion may ensure a substantially
30 consistent, controlled, slow, smooth, and/or soft panel closure.
   [0068]          The shutter panel may include a damping device operably associated with the
   louver and configured to resist movement of the louver. The damping device may be
                                                    0

    actuated based on an angular orientation of the louver relative to a fully closed position. In
    some implementations, the damping device is actuated based on the louver being oriented
    between about 1 degree and about 30 degrees from a fully closed position. In some
    implementations, the damping device is actuated based on the louver being oriented between
 5  about 10 degrees and about 20 degrees from a fully closed position. In some
    implementations, the damping device is actuated based on the louver being oriented at about
    15 degrees from a fully closed position.
    [0069]           Upon actuation, the damping device may control a rate of louver movement.
    In some implementations, the damping device is used in a shutter panel employing a closure
 0  device. In these implementations, upon actuation, the damping device may control or govern
    a rate of closure of the closure device and may provide a substantially consistent, controlled,
    smooth, and/or slow closure of the louver. In these implementations, the damping device
    may be actuated before, simultaneously, substantially simultaneously, or after the closure
    device is actuated.
 5  [00701           Additionally or alternatively, the shutter panel may include a tensioning
    feature. For example, once a louver is positioned in a desired orientation, the louver may be
    automatically held or retained in the desired orientation until a subsequent reorienting force is
    applied to the louver. The automatic orientation retention of the louver may occur without
    user actuation or interaction. The automatic tensioning of the louver may ensure the louver
 '0 remains in the desired orientation without inadvertent rotational slippage of the louver
    relative to a frame, substantially regardless of the tolerance between a louver pin and a
    receiving hole formed in the frame.
    [00711           The shutter panel may include a tensioning device operably associated with
    the louver and configured to retain the louver in a desired angular orientation. The tensioning
25  device may provide substantially constant and/or uniform friction or tension to the louver
    substantially regardless of the angular orientation of the louver. The tensioning device may
    be substantially unaffected by tolerance differences between the tensioning device and a
    receiving hole or cavity defined by a frame. The tensioning device may be used in a shutter
    panel employing a closure device, a damping device, or both.
30  [0072]           Referring to FIG. 1A, a shutter panel 2 for an architectural opening, such as a
    door, a window opening, or the like, is provided. The shutter panel 2 may include a frame 4
    and one or more louvers or slats 6. The frame 4 may include a pair of spaced apart,
    substantially-vertical members or stiles 8 interconnected together by a pair of spaced apart,
    substantially-horizontal members or rails 10. Collectively, the stiles 8 and the rails 10 may
                                                      1)

    form a perimeter of the frame 4 and define an interior space configured to receive the louvers
    6. Although a rectangular frame 4 is depicted, the frame 4 may be formed in substantially
    any shape (e.g., semi-circular) to accommodate various architectural openings.
    [0073]           The louvers 6 may be positioned within the interior space defined by the frame
 5  4 and may be rotatably coupled to the frame 4. As illustrated in FIG. 1A, the louvers 6 may
    extend between the stiles 8 in a transverse orientation (e.g., perpendicular) relative to the
    stiles 8. The louvers 6 may be individually attached to the stiles 8 so that a single louver 6
    may be replaced if damaged. Each louver 6 may be rotatable or tiltable about a longitudinal
    axis of the respective louver 6 between open and closed positions. In a fully opened position,
 0  each louver 6 may be positioned substantially perpendicular to the associated architectural
    opening to provide a minimum amount of privacy and a maximum amount of light passage.
    In this opened position, immediately adjacent louvers 6 may be separated from each other by
    a maximum distance. In a fully closed position, immediately adjacent louvers 6 may contact
    or abut one another to provide a maximum amount of privacy and a minimum amount of light
 5  passage. In this closed position, immediately adjacent louvers 6 may be separated from each
    other by a minimum distance. The louvers 6 may include one or two fully closed positions
    depending on the type of shutter panel 2. For shutter panels with two closed positions, each
    closed position may be associated with an opposite end of travel of a respective louver 6.
    [0074]           The louvers 6 may be coupled or grouped together so that the louvers rotate
 '0 substantially in unison. For example, a tilt bar 12 may be attached to each louver 6 to link the
    individual louvers together so that movement of the tilt bar 12 causes a substantially uniform
    movement of the louvers 6. Alternatively, each louver 6 may be operably associated with a
    gear track system embedded within each stile 8. A slider knob or other actuator may be
    operably associated with the gear track system to substantially uniformly move the louvers 6.
25  Alternatively, each louver 6 may be operably associated with a pulley system embedded
    within each stile 8. A slider knob or other actuator may be operably associated with the
    pulley system to substantially uniformly move the louvers 6.
    [00751           With reference to FIGS. 1A and 1B, each louver 6 may be rotatably attached
    to the stiles 8 by a pair of louver devices 14a, 14b. One louver device 14a may be received
30  within a stile 8 and a first end 6a of a respective louver 6. The other louver device 14b may
    be received within an opposing stile 8 and a second end 6b of the respective louver 6. The
    louver devices 14a, 14b may be substantially aligned along a longitudinal axis 16 of the
    respective louver 6. The louver devices 14a, 14b may be a standard louver pin, a louver
    closure device, a louver damping device, a louver tension device, or any combination thereof.
                                                      11

   [00761           With reference to FIGS. 2A-2C, a louver closure device 18 is provided. The
   closure device 18 may include a housing or shell 20, a louver pin 22, a rotary cam 24, a linear
   cam 26, and a helically-wound compression spring 28, all of which may be aligned along a
   longitudinal axis 30 of the louver closure device 18. The rotary cam 24 and the linear cam 26
 5 may be positioned between the louver pin 22 and the compression spring 28 along the
   longitudinal axis 30 of the louver closure device 18. The rotary cam 24, the linear cam 26,
   and the compression spring 28 may be substantially encased or surrounded by the housing 20
   while the louver pin 22 may extend outward from the housing 20. The louver pin 22 and the
   rotary cam 24 may be rotatable relative to the housing 20 while the linear cam 26 may be
 0 non-rotatable relative to the housing 20.
   [00771           With reference to FIGS. 2A-3B, the housing 20 may be configured to receive
   at least a portion of the louver pin 22, the rotary cam 24, the linear cam 26, and the
   compression spring 28. The housing 20 may be formed as single part or multiple separable
   parts. In implementations where the housing is formed with multiple parts, the housing may
 5 include any number of parts, such as two or more parts. In one implementation, the housing
   includes two substantially identical halves, which may snugly fit together to encompass or
   surround at least some of the other components of the pin assembly.
   [0078]           With continued reference to FIGS. 2A-3B, the housing 20 may be formed as
   two housing members 20a, 20b that may be substantially identical to one another. Each
 0 housing member 20a, 20b may form a lengthwise half of the housing 20. Each housing
   member 20a, 20b may include a peripheral, substantially planar abutment surface 34
   extending lengthwise along the respective housing member 20a, 20b. A pair of interference
   pins 36 may protrude from each abutment surface 34 and may be snugly received within
   corresponding pin holes 38 formed in an opposing abutment surface 34 to secure the two
25 housing members 20a, 20b together.
   [00791           When assembled, the housing members 20a, 20b may define a series of
   substantially cylindrical inner walls 40a, 40b, 40c axially spaced along the longitudinal axis
   30 of the louver closure device 18. The inner walls 40a, 40b, 40c may define axially-spaced,
   contiguous sub-cavities 41a, 41b, 41c that may collectively form an internal cavity 41 of the
30 housing 20. The inner walls 40a, 40b, 40c each may have a different radius, thereby defining
   a series of shoulders 42a, 42b that form transitions between adjacent inner walls 40a, 40b,
   40c. The shoulders 42a, 42b may be oriented substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal
   axis 30. A longitudinally-extending slot 44 may be formed in one of the inner walls 40c.
                                                    12)

   [00801          The housing 20 may include a substantially cylindrical outer surface 46
   extending lengthwise between opposing ends 48a, 48b of the housing 20. The ends 48a, 48b
   of the housing 20 may be spaced apart from one another along the longitudinal axis 30 and
   may be oriented substantially perpendicular to the outer surface 46 of the housing 20. A
 5 circumferential flange 50 may extend radially outward from the outer surface 46 of the
   housing 20 adjacent one of the ends 48a of the housing. When attached to a shutter panel 2,
   the substantially cylindrical outer surface 46 of the housing 20 may be positioned within a
   receiving hole formed in a member of the shutter panel 2 (such as a louver 6, a stile 8, or a
   rail 10) and the circumferential flange 50 may abut a wall surrounding the hole to
 0 substantially prevent further insertion of the housing 20 into the hole. A pair of
   longitudinally-extending fins 52 may protrude radially outward from the outer surface 46 of
   the housing 20. The fins 52 may key into an inner wall of the shutter panel member that
   defines the hole to substantially prevent rotation of the housing 20 within the hole. Although
   depicted as substantially cylindrical, the outer surface 46 of the housing 20 may be formed in
 5 various transverse cross-sectional shapes, such as rectangular, triangular, or other suitable
   shapes.
   [00811          With reference to FIGS. 4A-4C, the louver pin 22 may include a first keyed
   portion 22a, a second keyed portion 22b, and a substantially cylindrical journal portion 22c
   positioned longitudinally between the first and second keyed portions 22a, 22b. The first
 0 keyed portion 22a may include a pair of longitudinally-extending fins 56 protruding outward
   from opposing sides of a substantially cylindrical outer wall 54. The second keyed portion
   22b of the louver pin 22 may have a rectangular transverse cross-sectional shape. The first
   and second keyed portions 22a, 22b may include any suitable keyed shape.
   [0082]          With reference back to FIGS. 2A-2C, the louver pin 22 may be positioned
25 coaxial along the longitudinal axis 30 of the louver closure device 18. The louver pin 22 may
   be oriented relative to the housing 20 so that the first keyed portion 22a of the louver pin 22
   protrudes from an end 48a of the housing 20, the second keyed portion 22b of the louver pin
   22 protrudes into the inner cavity 41b of the housing 20, and the journal portion 22c of the
   louver pin 22 is journaled within the inner wall 40a of the housing 20. As such, the louver
30 pin 22 may be rotatably supported by the housing 20 and may transfer rotation between
   components associated with the first and second keyed portions 22a, 22b of the louver pin 22.
   [0083]          The louver pin 22 also may include a tip portion 22d, which may be integrally
   formed with and extend longitudinally away from one end of the first keyed portion 22a. The
   tip portion 22d of the louver pin 22 may align the louver pin 22 within a louver pin receiving
                                                   1ll

   hole, which may be formed in an end of a louver 6, a stile 8, a rail 10, or the like. The tip
   portion 22d may be substantially conical (FIGS. 2A-2C and 4A-4B), pyramidal, frustum, or
   any other suitable longitudinally tapering shape.
   [0084]          The louver pin 22 further may include a collar portion 22e, which may extend
 5 radially outward from an opposite end of the first keyed portion 22a relative to the tip portion
   22d. The collar portion 22e may be adjacent the journal portion 22c of the louver pin 22.
   The collar portion 22e of the louver pin 22 may abut one end 48a of the housing 20 (FIG. 2A)
   to substantially prevent further insertion of the louver pin 22 into the internal cavity 41 of the
   housing 20. The collar portion 22e may be inset into the end 48a of the housing to reduce an
 0 effective length of the assembled housing 20 and louver pin 22, to provide an aesthetic
   appearance, or both. The collar portion 22e may be formed in various transverse cross
   sectional shapes.
   [0085]          The housing 20 and the louver pin 22 may be non-rotatably secured to
   different structures of the shutter panel 2 so that rotation of one structure relative to the other
 5 structure of the shutter panel 2 causes relative rotation between the housing 20 and the louver
   pin 22. For example, the housing 20 may be non-rotatably secured to a stile 8. In this
   example, the louver pin 22 may protrude from an end of the housing 20 and may be non
   rotatably secured to a corresponding louver 6. As such, rotation of the louver 6 may rotate
   the louver pin 22 relative to the housing 20. As another example, the housing 20 may be non
 0 rotatably secured to a louver 6. In this example, the louver pin 22 may protrude from an end
   of the housing 20 and may be non-rotatably secured to a stile 8. As such, rotation of the
   louver 6 may rotate the housing 20 relative to the louver pin 22. The housing 20 and the
   louver pin 22 may be non-rotatably embedded within the different structures of the shutter
   panel 2.
25 [0086]          With reference to FIGS. 5A-5D, the rotary cam 24 may include a substantially
   cylindrical body 58 having a substantially cylindrical outer wall 60 extending longitudinally
   between and terminating at opposing ends 62a, 62b of the body 58, both of which may be
   oriented substantially perpendicular to the substantially cylindrical outer wall 60. The body
   58 may include an internal wall 64 that defines a receptacle 66 that opens through one end
30 62a of the body 58. The receptacle 66 may be configured to receive the second keyed portion
   22b of the louver pin 22. The interface between the internal wall 64 of the body 58 and the
   second keyed portion 22b of the louver pin 22 may be configured to transmit rotational
   movement or torque. The second keyed portion 22b of the louver pin 22 and the internal wall
   64 of the rotary cam 24 may have various corresponding keyed shapes, such as the depicted
                                                    1A

    rectangular transverse cross-sectional shape. Alternatively, the louver pin 22 and the rotary
    cam 24 may be integrally formed as a single part.
    [00871           The rotary cam 24 may include an alignment key and the linear cam 26 may
    include a complementary alignment feature. For example, the rotary and linear cams 24, 26
 5  may include a complementary protuberance and groove. As another example, the rotary and
    linear cams 24, 26 may include a complementary spring-biased detent (such as a ball detent)
    and recessed receiving area. With continued reference to FIGS. 5A-5D, a transversely
    extending protuberance 67 may extend from the other end 62b of the body 58 and may define
    a cam surface 68. The cam surface 68 may include opposing sloped surfaces 68a, 68b that
 0  extend away from the end 62b of the body 58 at an angle P. The sloped surfaces 68a, 68b
    may converge together as the surfaces 68a, 68b extend away from the end 62b and may
    intersect at a transversely-extending peak 68c, which may be rounded. In some
    implementations, the angle a is between about 115 degrees and about 155 degrees. In one
    implementation, the angle a is about 135 degrees. The protuberance 67 may be integrally
 5  formed with the body 58 of the rotary cam 24. Alternatively, the protuberance 67 and the
    body 58 of the rotary cam 24 may be formed separately and attached together.
    [0088]           With reference back to FIGS. 2A-3B, the rotary cam 24 may be positioned
    within the cavity 41b of the housing 20 and may be rotatable relative to the housing 20 about
    the longitudinal axis 30 of the louver closure device 18. In one implementation, the
 '0 substantially cylindrical outer wall 60 of the rotary cam 24 is clearance fit within the inner
    wall 40b of the housing 20 to form a small annular gap between the outer wall 60 and the
    inner wall 40b. In this implementation, the second keyed portion 22b of the louver pin 22
    may centrally locate the rotary cam 24 along the longitudinal axis 30 of the housing 20. In
    another implementation, the substantially cylindrical outer wall 60 of the rotary cam 24 is
25  substantially congruent with and rotatably bears against the inner wall 40b of the housing 20.
    [0089]           The rotary cam 24 may be oriented within the sub-cavity 41b of the housing
    20 so that the receptacle 66 may open to the sub-cavity 41a (FIGS. 2A-3B). In this
    orientation, the journal portion 22c of the louver pin 22 may rotatably bear against the inner
    wall 40a of the housing 20 and the second keyed portion 22b of the louver pin 22 may extend
30  into the receptacle 66 to non-rotatably couple the first keyed portion 22a of the louver pin 22
    and the rotary cam 24. The end 62a of the body 58 of the rotary cam 24 may confront the
    shoulder 42a of the housing 20, and the opposite end 62b of the body 58 may confront the
    shoulder 42b of the housing 20 (see FIGS. 7A-9B). The shoulders 42a, 42b of the housing 20

   may substantially restrain the axial or longitudinal position of the rotary cam 24 relative to
   the housing 20.
   [0090]           With reference to FIGS. 6A-6B, the linear cam 26 may include a substantially
   cylindrical body 70 having a substantially cylindrical outer wall 72 extending longitudinally
 5 between and terminating at opposing ends 74a, 74b of the body 70, both of which may be
   oriented substantially perpendicular to the substantially cylindrical outer wall 72. A pair of
   longitudinally-extending ribs 76 may protrude radially outward from the outer wall 72 of the
   body 70 of the linear cam 26. The ribs 76 may be diametrically opposed about the outer wall
   72 and may be received within corresponding slots 44 formed in the inner wall 40c of the
 0 housing 20 (see FIGS. 7B, 8B, and 9B).
   [0091]           The linear cam 26 may be slidable relative to the housing 20. With reference
   to FIGS. 7B, 8B, and 9B, the ribs 76 may be shorter in length than the slots 44 to permit
   longitudinal movement of the linear cam 26 relative to the housing 20. The difference in
   length between the ribs 76 and the slots 44 may substantially correspond to the longitudinal
 5 distance D1 between the rounded peak 68c of the cam surface 68 and the associated end 62b
   of the body 58 of the rotary cam 24 (FIG. 5D). Additionally or alternatively, the linear cam
   26 may be non-rotatable relative to the housing 20. For example, the ribs 76 may have
   substantially equal widths to the slots 44 to substantially prevent rotation of the linear cam 26
   relative to the housing 20 (see FIG. 7A). Although a pair of ribs 76 is depicted in FIGS. 6A
 0 6B, more or less ribs 76 may be provided.
   [0092]           With continued reference to FIGS. 6A-6B, a cam surface 78 may be formed
   into an end 74a of the body 70 of the linear cam 26 and may define a transversely-extending
   groove 80. The cam surface 78 may include opposing sloped surfaces 78a, 78b that recess
   into the body 70 from one end 74a of the linear cam 26 toward an opposing end 74b. The
25 sloped surfaces 78a, 78b may converge together as the surfaces 78a, 78b extend toward the
   opposing end 74b of the body 70 and may intersect at a transversely-extending trough 78c,
   which may be rounded. The sloped surfaces 78a, 78b of the linear cam 26 and the sloped
   surfaces 68a, 68b of the rotary cam 24 may be formed at supplementary angles relative to one
   another.
30 [0093]           With reference back to FIGS. 2A-3B, the linear cam 26 may be positioned
   within the cavity 41 c of the housing 20 and may be slidable relative to the housing 20 along
   the longitudinal axis 30 of the louver closure device 18. The substantially cylindrical outer
   wall 72 of the linear cam 26 may be substantially congruent with and may slidably bear
   against the inner wall 40c of the housing 20. The end 74a of the linear cam 26 associated
                                                   1A

    with the cam surface 78 may confront the end 62b of the rotary cam 24 associated with the
    cam surface 68. The opposite end 74b of the linear cam 26 may contact the compression
    spring 28, which may be longitudinally positioned between the linear cam 26 and an inner
    end wall or abutment shoulder 42c of housing 20 (see FIGS. 2B-3B). Biasing elements other
 5  than a compression spring 28 may be used. For example, the biasing element may be other
    types of springs, a fluid, or other suitable resilient energy storage devices.
    [0094]           With reference to FIGS. 7A and 7B, the louver closure device 18 is depicted in
    a first position, which may correspond to a fully-opened louver position (position A in FIG.
    10). In the first position, the rotary cam 24 and the linear cam 26 may be oriented relative to
 0  one another so that the protuberance 67 of the rotary cam 24 is oriented substantially
    orthogonal to the groove 80 formed in the linear cam 26. The peak 68c of the cam surface 68
    of the rotary cam 24 may abut or contact a confronting end 74a of the linear cam 26. An
    opposing end 62a of the rotary cam 24 may abut or contact a confronting shoulder 42a of the
    housing 20.
 5  [00951           The louver closure device 18 may be configured to provide a consistent
    holding force that maintains the louvers 6 in a desired position. With continued reference to
    FIGS. 7A and 7B, the compression spring 28 may be positioned between one end 74b of the
    linear cam 26 and an opposing wall 42c of the housing 20. The compression spring 28 may
    exert an axial force on the linear cam 26, which may result in a compressive force being
 '0 applied to the rotary cam 24. The compressive force may be created by the end 74a of the
    linear cam 26 applying an axial force on the protuberance 67 of the cam surface 68 and the
    shoulder 42a of the housing 20 applying an axial, reactionary force on an opposite end 62a of
    the rotary cam 24.
    [0096]           The compressive force exerted on the rotary cam 24 may generate a resistive
25  friction force that generally opposes relative rotational movement between the rotary cam 24
    (and thus the louver pin 22) and the housing 20. In this manner, the louver closure device 18
    may counteract gravitational forces applied to the louver 6 and generally resist louver
    movement. The magnitude of the resistive friction force may be increased or decreased by
    altering a coefficient of friction between the contacting surfaces (such as by altering
30  materials, surface finish, or the like), by altering a spring force exerted by the compression
    spring 28, or both. The spring 28 may be selected from an assortment of springs based on the
    specific louver panel application.
    [00971           Once a torque sufficient to overcome the resistive friction force of the louver
    closure device 18 is applied to the louver pin 22 or the housing 20, the rotary cam 24 and the
                                                      1'7

    louver pin 22 may rotate relative to the housing 20 and the linear cam 26, or vice versa.
    During the relative rotation between the rotary cam 24 and the linear cam 26, the
    transversely-extending peak 68c of the cam surface 68 may rotatably bear against the
    confronting end 74a of the linear cam 26. The relative rotation between the rotary cam 24
 5  and the linear cam 26 may cause the relative angle between the protuberance 67 and the
    groove 80 to decrease from substantially perpendicular to an acute angle. With reference to
    FIG. 10, this relative rotation between the rotary cam 24 and the linear cam 26 may
    correspond to the louver 6 moving from position A toward position BI or position B2. At
    substantially any point during this rotation, the user-initiated force may be ceased and the
 0  resistive friction force or tension in one or more louver devices may maintain the orientation
    of the louver 6 until further louver movement is initiated by the user.
    [00981            With reference to FIGS. 8A-8B, the louver closure device 18 is depicted in a
    second position, which may correspond to a partially-opened louver position (position BI or
    B2 in FIG. 10). In the second position, the transversely-extending peak 68c of the
 5  protuberance 67 may span the groove 80 formed in the linear cam 26 and contact the end 74a
    of the linear cam 26 immediately adjacent opposing corners of the groove 80. Further
    rotation of an associated louver 6 in a closing direction may cause the opposing ends of the
    cam surface 68 to contact the opposing sloped surfaces 78a, 78b of the cam surface 78. Once
    the protuberance 67 begins to enter the groove 80, the compression spring 28 may slide the
 '0 linear cam 26 axially relative to the housing 20 toward the rotatable, substantially non
    slidable rotary cam 24, which may cause the rotary cam 24 to rotate until the protuberance 67
    is at least partially seated within the groove 80 (FIGS. 9A-9B). Generally, the interface of
    the protuberance 67 with the sloped side walls of the groove 80 may cause the rotary and
    linear cams 24, 26 to substantially align with one another with the protuberance 67 being at
25  least partially seated in the groove 80. As the louver pin 22 may be non-rotatably coupled to
    the rotary cam 24, the cam-driven rotation of the rotary cam 24 may cause the louver pin 22
    to rotate in the closed direction, thereby rotating a directly associated louver 6 toward a fully
    closed position. As each louver 6 in a shutter panel 2 may be interconnected to every other
    louver 6 in the shutter panel 2, the rotation of the directly associated louver 6 may cause
30  every louver 6 in the shutter panel 2 to similarly rotate toward a fully-closed position.
    [0099]            With reference to FIGS. 9A-9B, the louver closure device 18 is depicted in a
    third position, which may correspond to a fully-closed louver position (position C1 or C2 in
    FIG. 10). In the third position, the protuberance 67 of the rotary cam 24 may be at least
    partially seated within the groove 80 of the linear cam 26. The peak 68c of the cam surface
                                                     152

   68 of the rotary cam 24 may be rotationally offset from the trough 78c of the cam surface 78
   by an angle   # (see FIG. 10), which may correspond to an angular offset of the closed louvers
   6 from a reference axis (such as a vertical axis), which is further discussed below. In this
   third position, the compression spring 28 may apply an axial force to the linear cam 26 that
 5 biases the rotary cam 24 toward a fully seated position relative to the linear cam 26. Thus,
   the louver closure device 18 may apply a continuous force to an associated closed louver 6
   that may maintain the louver 6 in the fully-closed position until an opening force is applied to
   the louver 6. As each louver 6 in a shutter panel 2 may be interconnected to every other
   louver 6 in the shutter panel 2, the louver closure device 18 may maintain multiple louvers 6
 0 in the shutter panel 2 in a fully-closed position. To move the louvers 6 from the fully-closed
   position into an open position, a user-initiated force that is sufficient to overcome the biasing
   force of the louver closure device 18 may be applied to the louvers 6 (such as by a tilt bar, a
   gear track system, a pulley system, or another suitable drive system).
   [00100]          With reference to FIG. 10, a single louver 6 is depicted in relation to an upper
 5 rail 10a and a lower rail 1Ob (for clarity purposes only one louver 6 is depicted, although
   multiple louvers 6 may operate in the same fashion with adjacent louvers 6 contacting each
   other substantially simultaneously). The louver 6 may be in a fully-opened position when
   oriented in position A, which as previously discussed may correspond to the louver closure
   device 18 configuration depicted in FIGS. 7A and 7B. Rotating the louver 6 upward or
 O downward toward the upper rail 1Oa or the lower rail 1 Ob may rotate the louver within a non
   automatic closure angular range 84, which may have an angle P. When the louver 6 is
   positioned within the non-automatic closure angular range 84, the louver closure device 18
   may maintain the louver 6 in a desired orientation and a user-initiated force may be required
   to rotate the louver 6 into a different orientation.
25 [001011          Once the louver 6 is rotated to or beyond the angular position BI or B2, the
   louver 6 may enter into an automatic or cam-driven closure range 86, which may correspond
   to the louver closure device 18 configuration depicted in FIGS. 8A and 8B. When the louver
   6 is positioned within the self-closure range 86, which may have an angular range 0, the
   louver closure device 18 may drive or rotate the louver 6 into a fully-closed position. The
30 louver closure device 18 may move the louver 6 into the closed position without user
   interaction.
   [00102]          The angles  P and 0 may be   altered based on different applications, user
   preferences, and many other factors. For example, the corresponding cam features 67, 80 of
   the rotary and linear cams 24, 26 may be altered to change the closure angles. With reference
                                                     10

   to FIGS. 6A-6B, the angles    P and 0 may be altered by changing the width W of the entrance
   to the groove 80. By increasing the width W of the groove 80, the angle        P may  decrease and
   the angle 0 may increase. By decreasing the width W of the groove 80, the angle         P may
   increase and the angle 0 may decrease. In some implementations, the angle P is between
 5 about 120 degrees and about 160 degrees, and the angle 0 is between about 5 degrees and
   about 25 degrees. In one implementation, the angle      P is about  140 degrees and the angle 0 is
   about 15 degrees.
   [00103]          Once the louver 6 is oriented into the fully-closed angular position C1 or C2,
   which as previously discussed may correspond to the louver closure device 18 depicted in
 0 FIGS. 9A and 9B, the louver 6 may be maintained in this orientation until a user-initiated
   force rotates the louver 6 from the closed position toward an open position. When the louver
   6 is positioned in the fully-closed angular position C1 or C2, the louver 6 may be offset from
   a plane that bisects the upper and lower rails 10a, 10b by an angle $, which may vary
   depending on the shutter panel 2. In some implementations, the angle        4 is between about 6
 5 degrees and about 8 degrees. As previously discussed, the louver closure device 18 may
   provide a closure range that includes the stop offset angle   #.  That is, the louver closure
   device 18 may provide a closure range of angle 0 plus angle      # in relation to either or both
   ends of travel of a louver 6. Thus, the effective closure range of a louver 6 may be
   represented as the self-closure range 86 having an angular range of 0.
 0 [00104]          Generally, the corresponding cam features may generate a rotational force
   when substantially aligned with one another. The profiles of the cam surface 68 and the cam
   surface 78 may be switched without effecting the operation of the louver closure device 18.
   That is, in one implementation, the cam surface 68 is recessed into an end 62b of the body 58
   of the rotary cam 24 and the cam surface 78 protrudes from a confronting end 74a of the body
25 70 of the linear cam 26.
   [00105]          The automatic or self-closure of the louvers 6 may be advantageous in view of
   conventional shutters, which may experience inconsistent or uneven louver closure due at
   least in part to component tolerances designed to prevent binding. For example, when a force
   is applied near an end of a conventional shutter panel, some of the louver motion caused by
30 the force may not be transferred through the shutter panel as the component tolerances may
   absorb some of the motion. Thus, louvers near an opposite end of the panel may not travel as
   far as the louvers near the force application point. The varying amount of louver travel
   through the shutter panel may result in inconsistent or uneven louver closure. In some
   circumstances, the inconsistent or uneven louver closure may permit undesired light passage

   through the shutter panel, despite a user applying a force to the shutter panel to close the
   shutters. By including at least one louver closure device 18 in a shutter panel 2, the louvers 6
   in the shutter panel 2 may automatically close into a fully closed position and may remain in
   that position until an opening force is applied to the louvers 6. Multiple louver pin cam
 5 assemblies 18 may be used in some shutter panels and may be dispersed through the shutter
   panel to ensure consistent and reliable louver closure. The automatic closure angle of the
   louver closure assembly may be altered based on user preferences.
   [00106]         With reference to FIGS. 1 1-12B, a louver tension device 118 is provided.
   With the exception of the rotary cam 124 not including a protuberance 67, the louver tension
 0 device 118 generally has the same features as the louver closure device 18. Accordingly, the
   preceding discussion of the housing 20, the louver pin 22, the rotary cam 24, the linear cam
   26, and the compression spring 28 should be considered equally applicable to the louver
   tension device 118, except as noted in the following discussion. The reference numerals used
   in FIGS. 1 1-12B generally correspond to the reference numbers used in FIGS. 1-10 to reflect
 5 the similar parts and components, except the reference numerals are incremented by one
   hundred.
   [001071         With continued reference to FIGS. 1 1-12B, the louver tension device 118 may
   include a housing 120, a louver pin 122, a rotary cam 124, a linear cam 126, and a spring 128.
   The housing 120, the louver pin 122, the rotary cam 124, the linear cam 126, and the spring
 0 128 may be aligned along a longitudinal axis 130 of the louver tension device 118. The
   louver pin 122 may be rotatably mounted to the housing 120 such that a first keyed portion
   122a protrudes from the housing 120 along the longitudinal axis 130 of the louver tension
   device 118 and a second keyed portion 122b extends into an inner cavity 141 defined by the
   housing 120. The rotary cam 124, the linear cam 126, and the spring 128 may be positioned
25 within the housing 120, with the linear cam 126 positioned intermediate the rotary cam 124
   and the spring 128 along the longitudinal axis 130. The rotary cam 124 may be positioned
   within the cavity 141 and may be non-rotatably coupled to the louver pin 122. The linear
   cam 126 may be positioned within the cavity 141 immediately adjacent the rotary cam 124
   and may be biased into contact with the rotary cam 124 by a compression spring 128 or many
30 other suitable biasing elements.
   [00108]         The louver tension device 118 may be configured to provide a consistent
   holding force that maintains the louver 6 in a desired position. With continued reference to
   FIGS. 11-12B, the compression spring 128 may be positioned between one end 174b of the
   linear cam 126 and an opposing wall 142c of the housing 120. The compression spring 128
                                                   21

    may exert an axial force on the linear cam 126, which may result in a compressive force
    being applied to the rotary cam 124. The compressive force may be created by the end 174a
    of the linear cam 126 applying an axial force on a confronting end 162b of the rotary cam
    124, and the shoulder 142a of the housing 120 applying an axial, reactionary force on an
 5  opposite end 162a of the rotary cam 124.
    [00109]          The compressive force exerted on the rotary cam 124 may generate a resistive
    friction force that generally opposes relative rotational movement between the rotary cam 124
    (and thus the louver pin 122) and the housing 120. In this manner, the louver tension device
    118 may counteract gravitational forces applied to the louvers 6 and generally resist louver
 0  movement. The magnitude of the resistive friction force may be increased or decreased by
    altering a coefficient of friction between the contacting surfaces (such as by altering
    materials, surface finish, or the like), by altering a spring force exerted by the compression
    spring 128, or both. The spring 128 may be selected from an assortment of springs based on
    a specific shutter panel application.
 5  [001101          Each louver tension device 118 may be configured to restrain or inhibit
    rotation of at least a portion of one louver 6 until a user-initiated force is applied to the louver
    6. For example, a single louver tension device 118 may resist rotation of a portion of the
    louvers 6 in a given shutter panel 2 so that multiple louver pin tension assemblies 118 may
    collectively maintain all of the shutter panel louvers in a given position. As another example,
 '0 a single louver tension device 118 may resist rotation of all louvers 6 in a given shutter panel
    2 so that a single louver tension device 118 may individually maintain all of the shutter panel
    louvers in a given position.
    [00111]          Once a torque sufficient to overcome the resistive friction force of the louver
    tension device 118 is applied to the louver pin 122 or the housing 120, the rotary cam 124
25  and the louver pin 122 may rotate relative to the housing 120 and the linear cam 126, or vice
    versa. During the relative rotation between the rotary cam 124 and the linear cam 126, one
    end 162b of the rotary cam 124 may rotatably bear against the confronting end 174a of the
    linear cam 126. At substantially any point during this rotation, the user-initiated force may
    be ceased and the resistive friction force or tension in one or more louver tension assemblies
30  118 may maintain the orientation of the louver 6 until further louver movement is initiated by
    the user. As the rotary cam 124 does not include the protuberance 67, the contact area
    between the rotary cam 124 and the linear cam 126 is generally increased in the louver
    tension device 118 compared to the louver closure device 18. As such, the louver tension
    device 118 may provide a larger resistive friction force relative to the louver closure device

    18. Although the linear cam 126 is depicted with a groove 180 formed in a rotary-cam
    confronting end 174a of the linear cam 126, in some implementations the linear cam 126 does
    not include the groove 180 and the rotary-cam-confronting end 174a of the linear cam 126
    may be substantially continuous.
 5  [00112]          The louver tension device 118 may provide advantages relative to
    conventional louver tension pins. For example, the louver tension device 118 may provide
    substantially consistent frictional resistance or tension to the shutter panel regardless of a fit
    or tolerance between an inner wall of a receiving hole and an outer wall of the housing 120.
    In various implementations, the resistive frictional force generated between the confronting
 0  end faces of the rotary cam 124 and the linear cam 126 may be substantially unaffected by
    the fit or tolerance of the housing 120 and an inner wall of a receiving hole. That is, the
    louver tension device 118 may resist louver rotation with a substantially consistent force
    regardless of tolerance variations between the louver tension device 118 and a corresponding
    structure of the shutter panel 2.
 5  [00113]          With reference to FIGS. 13-15, a louver damping device 218 is provided. The
    louver damper assembly 218 may include a damper 219, a deadband system 221, a centering
    system 223, and a housing 220. The damper 219, the deadband system 221, and the centering
    system 223 may be received within an internal cavity 241 of the housing 220 and may be
    aligned along a longitudinal axis 230 of the louver damping device 218.
 '0 [00114]          The damper 219 may be a rotary damper and may include a barrel or outer
    wall 225 that is non-rotatably keyed to the housing 220 to substantially prevent relative
    rotation between the outer wall 225 of the damper 219 and the housing 220. As illustrated in
    FIGS. 13-15, a longitudinally-extending spline 227 may protrude radially outward from a
    substantially cylindrical section 225a of the outer wall 225 of the damper 219 and may be
25  received within a corresponding longitudinally-extending slit 229 formed in the housing 220,
    although other corresponding keyed structures may be used. In one implementation, one-half
    of the slit 229 is defined by a first housing member 220a and the other half of the slit 229 is
    defined by a second housing member 220b to ease positioning of the spline 227 within the slit
    229 during assembly.
30  [00115]          With continued reference to FIGS. 13-15, the substantially cylindrical section
    225a of the damper 219 may terminate at opposing, transversely-oriented ends 225b, 225c.
    One of the ends 225b of the outer wall 225 of the damper 219 may abut against a shoulder
    242c of the housing 220 and the other of the ends 225c of the outer wall 225 of the damper
    219 may abut against an opposing shoulder 242a of the housing 220 to substantially axially

    restrain the damper 219 within the housing 220. A boss 231 may extend longitudinally away
    from one end 225b of the outer wall 225 and may extend beyond the shoulder 242c of the
    housing 220 to reduce the longitudinal envelope of the louver damping device 218. An
    operative shaft 233 of the damper 219 may extend longitudinally away from the other end
 5  225c of the outer wall 225.
    [00116]         In some implementations, a rotary damper manufactured by Nifco Inc. may be
    used. In one implementation, a small axis damper manufactured by Nifco Inc. (for example,
    part number 3F7W or 3F7X) may be used. The torque specification of the damper may vary
    depending on the shutter panel application. In one implementation, the damper torque may
 0  be about 5 Ncm, about 10 Ncm, or any other suitable torque level based on the shutter panel
    application.
    [001171         The deadband system 221 may be non-rotatably keyed to the shaft 233 of the
    damper 219 to selectively transfer torque from an associated louver 6 to the damper 219
    based upon a rotational orientation of the louver 6. The deadband system 221 may include a
 5  damper adapter 235 and a louver pin adapter 237. The damper adapter 235 may be
    positioned intermediate the louver pin adapter 237 and the damper 219 along the longitudinal
    axis 230 of the louver damping device 218.
    [00118]         With continued reference to FIGS. 13-15, the damper adapter 235 may be
    keyed to the damper 219 and selectively transfer torque between the louver pin adapter 237
 '0 and the damper 219. The damper adapter 235 may include a damper interface portion 235a, a
    louver pin adapter interface portion 235b, and a centering system interface portion 235c. The
    damper interface portion 235a may be associated with one end of the damper adapter 235.
    The damper interface portion 235a may be formed as a sleeve having a substantially
    cylindrical outer wall 239 and a keyed inner wall 243 corresponding in shape to an outer
25  surface of the operative shaft 233 of the damper 219. When the louver damping device 218 is
    assembled, the damper interface portion 235a may at least partially surround the operative
    shaft 233 of the damper 219.
    [00119]         The louver pin adapter interface portion 235b of the damper adapter 235 may
    be associated with an opposing end of the damper adapter 235 relative to the damper
30  interface portion 235a. The louver pin adapter interface portion 235b may include two
    diametrically opposed tangs 245. The tangs 245 may protrude axially from a substantially
    flat end face 247 of the louver pin adapter 237. When the louver damping device 218 is
    assembled, the tangs 245 may selectively interact with the louver pin adapter 237, which is
    discussed in more detail later in this disclosure.

    [001201         The centering system interface portion 235c of the damper adapter 235 may be
    positioned intermediate the damper interface portion 235a and the louver pin adapter
    interface portion 235b. The centering system interface portion 235c may include a cam
    actuator 267 extending axially in a direction away from the tangs 245 toward the damper 219.
 5  The cam actuator 267 may be formed as a wedge, as illustrated in FIGS. 13-15. When the
    louver damping device 218 is assembled, the cam actuator 267 may interact with the
    centering system 223, which is discussed in more detail later in this disclosure.
    [00121]         With continued reference to FIGS. 13-15, the louver pin adapter 237 may be
    non-rotatably keyed to the louver pin 22 (see FIGS. 2A-2C) to selectively transfer torque
 0  between the louver pin 22 and the damper adapter 235. The second keyed portion 22b of the
    louver pin 22 may be received within a receptacle 266 defined by an internal wall 264 of the
    louver pin adapter 237. The receptacle 266 may open through one end 237a of the louver pin
    adapter 237. In some implementations, the louver pin adapter 237 may be integrally formed
    with the louver pin 22.
 5  [00122]         The louver pin adapter 237 may include two wings 249 extending radially
    outward from a substantially cylindrical bearing surface 251. The wings 249 and the
    substantially cylindrical bearing surface 251 may protrude longitudinally from an end 237b of
    the louver pin adapter 237. When the louver damping device 218 is assembled, the tangs 245
    of the damper adapter 235 may rotatably bear against the substantially cylindrical bearing
 '0 surface 251 of the louver pin adapter 237 to maintain an axial alignment between the damper
    adapter 235 and the louver pin adapter 237. Additionally, the tangs 245 of the damper
    adapter 235 may be positioned within a rotational path of the wings 249 of the louver pin
    adapter 249 to selectively transfer torque from the louver pin adapter 237 through the damper
    adapter 235 to the damper 219.
25  [00123]         Within continued reference to FIGS. 13-15, the centering system 223 of the
    louver damping device 218 may include a linear cam 226 and a helically-wound compression
    spring 228. The linear cam 226 may include one or more longitudinally-extending slots 253
    formed in an outer surface of the linear cam 226 that may slidably receive one or more
    longitudinally-extending, radially inward directed ribs 255 of the housing 220. As such, the
30  linear cam 226 may be slidable, but substantially non-rotatable, relative to the housing 220.
    The linear cam 226 also may include a substantially v-shaped groove 257 recessed into one
    end of the linear cam 226 and defined by opposing sidewalls 259. The mouth or width of the
    groove 257 may be larger than the width W of the groove 80 of the linear cam 26 (see FIGS.
    6A-6B) so that the cam actuator 267 remains at least partially seated within the groove 257

   during closure of the louver 6. When the louver damping device 218 is assembled, the cam
   actuator 267 of the damper adapter 235 may be seated within the groove 257 of the linear
   cam 226 (FIG. 15). Additionally, the compression spring 228 may be positioned between the
   linear cam 226 and a confronting end 225c of the damper 219. The compression spring may
 5 bias the cam actuator 267 into the seated position.
   [00124]         With continued reference to FIGS. 13-15, the operation of the louver damping
   device 218 is discussed in relation to a shutter panel 2 including a louver closure device 18
   for clarity purposes. As the louver pin adapter 237 may be linked to a louver 6 through a
   louver pin 22, the louver pin adapter 237 may rotate in unison with the louver 6. Thus, as the
 0 louver 6 is rotated, the louver pin adapter 237 may rotate in the same general direction as the
   louver 6. Similar to the corresponding cam features of the rotary cam 24 and the linear cam
   26 of the louver closure device 18, the wings 249 of the louver pin adapter 237 and the tangs
   245 of the damper adapter 235 may be rotationally misaligned by about 90 degrees when the
   louver 6 is in a fully-opened position. From this fully-opened position, rotation of the louver
 5 6 toward a closed position may rotate the louver pin adapter 237 relative to the damper
   adapter 235, thereby moving the wings 249 of the louver pin adapter 237 toward the tangs
   245 of the damper adapter 235.
   [00125]         Once the wings 249 of the louver pin adapter 237 contact the tangs 245 of the
   damper adapter 235, further rotation of the louver 6 in a closing direction (which may be
 0 driven by the louver closure device 18) may be transferred to the damper 219 through the
   keyed engagement of the damper adapter 235 and the shaft 233 of the damper 219. That is,
   rotational alignment of the wings 249 and the tangs 245 may result in damper engagement.
   Once engaged, the damper 219 may resist further rotation of the louver 6 in a closing
   direction. The radial width of the wings 249 and the tangs 245 may be configured such that
25 the wings 249 contact or engage the tangs 245, thereby actuating the damper 219,
   substantially simultaneously with the actuation of the louver closure device 18. The damping
   rate of the damper 219 may restrain the closing force of the louver closure device 18 and
   provide a generally controlled, consistent, slow, and/or smooth closure. As such, the
   damping rate of the damper 219 may control or govern the rate of closure of the louver 6.
30 The actuation of the louver damping device 218 may be altered by changing the radial width
   of the tangs 245, the wings 249, or both.
   [00126]         As the damper adapter 235 is rotated by the louver pin adapter 237 during
   closure of the louver 6, the damper adapter 235 may rotate relative to the linear cam 226,
   which may be positioned around the outer wall 239 of the sleeve portion 235a of the damper

    adapter 235. The relative rotation between the damper adapter 235 and the linear cam 226
    may cause the cam actuator 267 to contact a sidewall 259 of the groove 257 and drive the
    linear cam 226 toward the damper 219 against the spring force of the compression spring
    228. When the louver 6 is in a fully closed position, the louver closure device 18 may hold
 5  the louver 6 in the fully closed position, thereby maintaining the cam actuator 267 in
    engagement with the sidewall 259 of the groove 257 (the spring force of the compression
    spring 28 of the louver closure device 18 is larger than the spring force of the compression
    spring 228).
    [001271          To open the louver 6 from the fully-closed position, an opening force that
 0  exceeds the closing force of the louver closure device 18 may be applied to the louver 6. As
    the louver 6 is opened, the louver pin adapter 237 may rotate in unison with the louver 6.
    Also, the compression spring 228 of the louver damping device 218 may slide the linear cam
    226 away from the damper 219 toward the louver pin adapter 237, which may cause the
    sidewall 259 of the groove 257 to apply a lateral force to the cam actuator 267 of the damper
 5  adapter 235, which may rotate the damper adapter 235(and thus the damper 219) into its
    initial position that may correspond to a fully-opened louver position. In this position, the
    cam actuator 267 may be seated in the groove 257 and the tangs 245 may be rotated into their
    pre-engagement position relative to the wings 249 of the louver pin adapter 237.
    [00128]          The louver damping device 218 may provide a generally controlled,
 '0 consistent, slow, and/or smooth closure of the louver 6. The deadband system 221 of the
    louver damping device 218 may provide a first angular range in which the damper 219 is
    disengaged from the louver 6 and a second angular range in which the damper 219 resists
    rotation of the louver 6. The centering system 223 of the louver damping device 218 may re
    align or re-center at least some of the components of the louver damping device 218(which
25  may include the damper 219) in preparation for subsequent louver closure.
    [00129]          By including a louver closure device 18 and a louver damping device 218 in a
    shutter panel 2, the louvers 6 in the shutter panel 2 may automatically close in a generally
    controlled, consistent, slow, and/or smooth manner into a fully closed position and may
    remain in that position until an opening force is applied to the louvers 6. Multiple louver
30  damping assemblies 218 may be used in some shutter panels and may be dispersed through
    the shutter panel to ensure a controlled louver closure. The actuation of the louver damping
    device 218 may be altered based on user preferences.
    [00130]          With reference to FIGS. 16-19C, another louver damping device 318 is
    provided. With reference to FIGS. 16-18, the louver damping device 318 may include a
                                                    17

    housing 320, a rotary damper 319, a damper adapter 335, a rotary cam 324, and a pair of leaf
    springs 328. The rotary cam 324 may include a gear portion 361 for engagement with a pair
    of gear racks 363, which may form part of a gear track system embedded within a
    substantially hollow stile 8. Although the gear racks 363 are depicted as being generally
 5  elongated, the gear racks 363 may be shortened and form part of a louver rotation mechanism
    as discussed in U.S. Patent No. 7,389,609, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein
    in its entirety.
    [001311          The housing 320 may include a base 320a and multiple side panels 320b-320e
    attached to and extending away from the base 320 to form a substantially rectangular body
 0  closed at one end and open at the other end. Although not depicted, the housing 320 may
    include a removable cover that closes the open end of the substantially rectangular body. The
    cover may include an aperture for permitting passage of the gear portion 361 of the rotary
    cam 324 so that the gear portion 361 may engage the gear racks 363 exterior to the housing
    320.
 5  [00132]          With continued reference to FIGS. 16-18, the rotary damper 319 may include
    one or more mounting ears 331, each of which may define an aperture 331a configured to
    receive a mounting pin 329 that protrudes from the base 320a of the housing 320. The rotary
    damper 319 may be mounted to the housing 320 in many other manners, including by use of
    various types of fasteners. The rotary damper 319 may include an operative shaft 333. The
 '0 rotary damper 319 may function in a similar manner as the rotary damper 219. An example
    rotary damper 319 may be a dual direction damper available at McMaster-Carr@ and
    identifiable by part number 6597K14.
    [001331          The damper adapter 335 may interconnect the rotary damper 319 and the
    rotary cam 324. The damper adapter 335 may include a body 365 that includes an outer wall
25  365a and an inner wall 365b. The inner wall 365b may define a keyed socket corresponding
    in shape to and configured to receive the shaft 333 of the damper 319. A pair of wings 349
    may extend radially outward from the outer wall 365a of the body 365 of the damper adapter
    335. The wings 349 may be diametrically opposed about the outer wall 365a. A latch feature
    371 may extend longitudinally from one end of the body 365. The latch feature 371 may
30  include two resilient, transversely spaced arms 373 each having a barb 375 formed on a distal
    end relative to the body 365 of the damper adapter 335.
    [00134]          With continued reference to FIGS. 16-18, the rotary cam 324 may include a
    body 377 defining a recessed opening 379 configured to receive the damper adapter 335. The
    resilient arms 373 of the damper adapter 335 may pass through a portion of the recessed

    opening 379 and the barbs 375 may snapingly engage an inner, transversely-oriented wall
    381 of the rotary cam 324 (see FIGS. 19A-19C) to attach the damper adapter 335 to the
    rotary cam 324. For example, during passage through a lengthwise-extending bore defined
    by an inner wall of the rotary cam 324, the resilient arms 373 may be elastically deformed
 5  toward one another in a transverse direction. Once the barbs 375 axially surpass the
    transversely-oriented wall 381 of the rotary cam 324, the resilient arms 373 may elastically
    move away from one another in a transverse direction, thereby engaging the barbs 375 with
    the inner, transversely-oriented wall 381. An abutment surface may contact or abut an
    opposing transversely-oriented wall of the rotary cam 324 to substantially prevent further
 0  insertion of the damper adapter 335 through the lengthwise-extending bore of the rotary cam
    324. As such, when attached together, the rotary cam 324 and the damper adapter 335 may
    be axially constrained, but rotatable, relative to another. As illustrated in FIGS. 17-18, the
    rotary cam 324, the damper adapter 335, and the damper 319 may be aligned along a
    longitudinal axis 330, which may be coaxial with a rotation axis of a louver 6.
 5  [001351         The rotary cam 324 may include a pair of diametrically opposed tangs 345 that
    extend radially inward from the body 377 into the recessed opening 379 (FIG. 18). When the
    damper adapter 335 is attached to the rotary cam 324, the tangs 345 of the rotary cam 324
    may reside within a rotational path of the wings 349 of the damper adapter 335. As such,
    during relative rotation between the rotary cam 324 and the damper adapter 335, the tangs
 '0 345 and the wings 349 may abut or contact one another.
    [001361         The recessed opening 379 may extend through the body 377 of the rotary cam
    324 and may be configured to receive a louver pin in an opposing relationship to the damper
    adapter 335. In this configuration, the louver pin and the damper adapter 335 may be aligned
    along the longitudinal axis 330 of the louver damping device 318. The louver pin and the
25  rotary cam 324 may be non-rotatably keyed together with an interference or press fit or other
    keying structures, such as those previously discussed in connection with the louver pin 22
    and the louver closure device 18.
    [001371         With continued reference to FIGS. 16-18, the rotary cam 324 may include a
    pair of lobes 367 extending outward from opposing sides of the body 377 of the rotary cam
30  324. The lobes 367 may include an arcuate or curved outer cam surface 383. The lobes 367
    may be substantially identical to one another. The lobes 367 may be axially separated from a
    louver pin side of the rotary cam 324 by the gear portion 361, which may include a plurality
    of external teeth 385 radiating outward from the body 377 of the rotary cam 324.
                                                     10

   [001381          With continued reference to FIGS. 16-18, the leaf springs 328 may be
   substantially identical to one another. Each leaf spring 328 may be formed in a substantially
   sinusoidal shape with a pair of peaks 387 separated from each other by an elongated trough
   389. Each leaf spring 328 may include two free ends 328a, 328b, both of which may reside
 5 in a substantially common plane with the trough 389. When associated with the housing 320
   (FIGS. 16 and 19A-19C), the free ends 328a, 328b of each leaf spring 328 may be received in
   opposing, longitudinally-extending channels 390 formed in the housing 320. The channels
   390 may permit one or both of the free ends 328a, 328b of each leaf spring 328 to extend
   away from one another when the leaf spring 328 is elastically deformed. That is, at least one
 0 end 328a, 328b of each leaf spring 328 may not be fully seated in a respective channel 390 so
   that each leaf spring 328 may elastically deform in a lengthwise or flattening direction.
   Alternatively, each leaf spring 328 may include a pinned end. For example, at least one end
   328a, 328b of each leaf spring 328 may be include a lengthwise extending slot and a pin may
   be extended through the slot to permit axial movement of the respective end of the leaf spring
 5 328 relative to the housing 320. When the leaf springs 328 are associated with the housing
   320 (FIGS. 16 and 19A-19C), the peaks 387 and troughs 389 of the leaf springs 328 may be
   aligned with one another in a confronting relationship.
   [001391          With reference to FIGS. 19A-19C, the louver damping device 318 is
   illustrated in an assembled configuration with the rotary cam 324 positioned between the leaf
 0 springs 328. In the assembled configuration, the lobes 367 of the rotary cam 324 may be
   positioned adjacent opposing troughs 389 of the leaf springs 328. With reference to FIG.
   19A, the louver damping device 318 is depicted in a first position, which may correspond to a
   fully-opened louver position. In this position, each lobe 367 may be positioned substantially
   equidistant between successive peaks 387 of a corresponding leaf spring 328.
25 [00140]          Similar to the louver closure device 18, the louver tension device 118, and the
   louver damping device 218, the louver damping device 318 may be coupled to a louver 6 so
   that at least one component of the louver damping device 318 may rotate in unison with the
   louver 6. As previously discussed, the rotary cam 324 may be non-rotatably coupled to a
   louver pin to transfer torque between the louver 6 and the rotary cam 324. With reference
30 back to FIGS. 17-18, a user initiated force may be transmitted through the gear racks 363,
   which may link multiple louvers 6 together. The gear tracks 363 may interface with opposing
   sides of the gear portion 361 of the rotary cam 324 such that substantially linear movement of
   each of the gear tracks 363 in generally opposite directions relative to one another may rotate
   the rotary cam 324 about the longitudinal axis 330 of the louver damping device 318. As the

   rotary cam 324 may be non-rotatably coupled to a louver 6 through a louver pin (such as the
   louver pin 22), rotation of the rotary cam 324 may cause rotation of the louver 6. Thus, the
   operable movement of the gear racks 363 may rotate the rotary cam 324, which in turn may
   rotate the louver 6. Although not depicted, the louver pin closure device 18, the louver
 5 tension device 118, and the louver damping device 218 may be slightly modified to operate in
   connection with the gear racks 363. For example, the louver pin 22 or the housing 20, 120,
   220 may include external teeth configured to operatively engage the gear racks 363. In this
   manner, the louver closure device 18, the louver tension device 118, the louver damping
   device 218, 318, or a combination thereof may be used in connection with a shutter panel 2
 0 employing a gear rack drive or operating system.
   [00141]          With continued reference to FIG. 19A, as the louver 6 is rotated from the
   fully-opened position toward a closed position through motion of the gear racks 363 relative
   to one another, the rotary cam 324 may rotate in unison with the louver 6. As the louver 6
   approaches an automatic closure angular range (based on inclusion of a louver cam assembly
 5 18 within the shutter panel 2), the lobes 367 of the rotary cam 324 may approach sidewalls
   391 of the peaks 387 of the leaf springs 328 (FIGS. 19B and 19C), the tangs 345 on the rotary
   cam 324 may approach the wings 349 on the damper adapter 335, or both. The rotary cam
   324, the leaf spring 328, or both may be configured such that the lobes 367 of the rotary cam
   324 may contact or engage the sidewalls 391 of the peaks 387 simultaneously or substantially
 0 simultaneously with initiation of the automatic closure of the louver 6. Additionally or
   alternatively, the tangs 345, the wings 349, or both may be configured such that the tangs 345
   of the rotary cam 324 may contact or engage the wings 349 of the damper adapter 335
   simultaneously or substantially simultaneously with initiation of automatic closure of the
   louver 6, thereby engaging the damper 319 (through the operative shaft 333) simultaneously
25 or substantially simultaneously with the initiation of the automatic closure of the louver 6.
   Thus, as the louver closure device 18 drives the louver 6 toward a fully-closed position, the
   lobes 367 of the rotary cam 324 may contact and resiliently deform the sidewalls 387 of the
   peaks 391 of the leaf springs 328, which may generally resist or dampen the closure motion
   of the louver 6. Additionally or alternatively, as the louver closure device 18 drives the
30 louver 6 toward a fully closed position, the damper adapter 335 may selectively couple the
   rotary cam 324 and the damper 319 to generally resist or dampen the closure motion of the
   louver 6.
   [00142]          To reset or re-center the wings 349 of the damper adapter 335 relative to the
   tangs 345 of the rotary cam 324 (thereby resetting the damper deadband to the fully-opened

   louver position), the lobes 367 of the rotary cam 324 and the leaf springs 328 may be used on
   a smaller scale in association with the damper adapter 335. That is, the body 365 of the
   damper adapter 335 may include lobes protruding from opposite sides of the body 365 that
   selectively contact or engage peak sidewalls of opposing leaf springs based on the angular
 5 orientation of the louver 6. As the peak sidewalls of the opposing leaf springs may elastically
   deform during automatic louver closure, the leaf springs may store potential energy that may
   be released as the louver 6 is rotated from a fully-closed position toward a fully-opened
   position, which in turn may rotate the damper adapter 335 into its louver fully-opened
   position through the contact or engagement of the leaf springs and the lobes associated with
 0 the body 365 of the damper adapter 335. Additionally or alternatively, a button may be
   associated with a lobe 367 of the rotary cam 324 and selectively engagable with a wing 349
   of the damper adapter 335. A sidewall 387 and/or peak 391 of a corresponding leaf spring
   328 may depress the button as the louver 6 is approaching full closure, which may cause the
   button to contact a wing 349 of the damper adapter 335, which may rotate the damper adapter
 5 335 and reorient or re-center the wings 349 of the damper adapter 335 relative to the tangs
   345 of the rotary cam 324.
   [00143]         With reference to FIGS. 20-22, a louver closure and damping assembly 418 is
   provided in association with a common housing 420. The preceding discussion of the
   housing 20, the louver pin 22, the rotary cam 24, the linear cam 26, and the compression
 O spring 28 should be considered equally applicable to the louver closure and damping
   assembly 418, except as noted in the following discussion. The reference numerals used in
   FIGS. 20-22 generally correspond to the reference numbers used in FIGS. 1-10 to reflect the
   similar parts and components, except the reference numerals are incremented by four
   hundred.
25 [00144]         With continued reference to FIGS. 20-22, the louver closure and damping
   assembly 418 may include a housing 420, a louver pin 422, a rotary cam 424, a linear cam
   426, a compression spring 428, and a linear damper 419, all of which may be aligned along a
   longitudinal axis 430 of the louver closure and damping assembly 418. The rotary cam 424,
   the linear cam 426, the compression spring 428, and the linear damper 419 all may be at least
30 partially encased or received within the housing 420. The louver pin 422 may be rotatably
   supported by the housing 420 and may be non-rotatably coupled to the rotary cam 424. The
   louver pin 422 and the rotary cam 424 may be formed as a single part (as may be the louver
   pin 22 and the rotary cam 24) or the louver pin 422 and the rotary cam 424 may be formed as

    separate parts non-rotatably keyed together with a keying structure, such as that depicted in
    FIGS. 1-10 in relation to the louver pin 22 and the rotary cam 24.
    [00145]          The linear cam 426 may include a longitudinally-extending rod 488 protruding
    from an end 474b of the linear cam 426. The rod 488 may extend along the longitudinal axis
 5  430 of the louver closure and damping assembly 418 through an inner space of the
    compression spring 428 and the damper 419. A fastener, such as a clip 490, may be
    interference or press fit within a circumferential groove 491 formed in a distal end of the rod
    488 that extends axially beyond the damper 419.
    [00146]          With reference to FIG. 20, the louver closure and damping assembly 418 is
 0  illustrated in a first position, which may correspond to a fully-closed louver position. In the
    first position, the protrusion 467 of the rotary cam 424 may be substantially fully seated
    within the groove 480 formed in the linear cam 426. The compression spring 428 may be
    positioned between the linear cam 426 and a stationary wall 492 of the housing 420. The
    compression spring 428 may bias the linear cam 426 into the fully seated position with the
 5  rotary cam 424. As the rod 488 may be attached to the linear cam 426, linear movement of
    the cam 426 toward the rotary cam 424 may cause the clip 490 to compress the linear damper
    419 between the clip 490 and the stationary wall 492, as illustrated in FIG. 20. Thus, the
    damping or resistive force of the damper 419 may generally oppose the spring force of the
    compression spring 428. The spring force of the compression spring 428 may be greater in
 '0 magnitude than the damping force of the damper 419.
    [001471          With continued reference to FIG. 20, to move a louver 6 from a fully-closed
    position toward a fully-opened position, the louver pin 422 may be rotated relative to the
    linear cam 426, which may cause the protrusion 467 of the rotary cam 424 to unseat from the
    groove 480 of the linear cam 426. The unseating of the protrusion 467 from the groove 480
25  may cause the linear cam 426 to slide along the longitudinal axis 430 relative to the housing
    420 away from the rotary cam 424 toward the stationary wall 492, thereby compressing the
    compression spring 428. The sliding movement of the linear cam 426 also may cause the clip
    490 to move axially away from the stationary wall 492, thereby allowing the damper 419 to
    expand, for example. The louver pin 422 may continue to be rotated relative to the linear
30  cam 426 until the protrusion 467 may be substantially orthogonal to the groove 480, at which
    point the louver 6 may be oriented in a fully-opened position. When the louver 6 is in the
    fully-opened position, the clip 490 may abut or contact the shoulder 442c of the housing 420.
    [00148]          With continued reference to FIG. 20, to move the louver 6 from the fully
    opened position toward the fully-closed position, the louver pin 422 may be rotated relative

    to the linear cam 426, which may cause the protrusion 467 of the rotary cam 424 to rotate
    relative groove 480 of the linear cam 426. Once the protrusion 467 substantially aligns with
    an edge of the groove 480, the compression spring 428 may slide the linear cam 426 along
    the longitudinal axis 430 relative to the housing 420 away from the stationary wall 492
 5  toward the rotary cam 424, thereby rotating the rotary cam 424 to further align the protrusion
    467 with the groove 480. The resulting rotation of the rotary cam 424 may cause the louver
    pin 422 to rotate in a louver closing direction, which may rotate the louver 6 toward the fully
    closed position. The sliding movement of the linear cam 426 also may cause the clip 490 to
    move axially toward the stationary wall 492, thereby compressing the damper 419. The
 0  damping or compression rate of the damper 419 may control or govern the spring force of the
    compression spring 428, which may result in a generally consistent, slow, and/or smooth
    louver closure. The louver 6 may be fully closed when the protrusion 467 of the rotary cam
    424 is substantially fully seated within the groove 480 of the linear cam 426. The damper
    419 may be a compressible material, such as a closed-cell or open-cell foam. In one
 5  implementation, the damper 419 is a closed-cell foam.
    [00149]         With reference to FIG. 23, a shutter panel 2 with a standard louver pin 15, a
    louver tension device 118, a louver closure device 18, a louver damping device 218, 318, and
    a louver closure and damping assembly 418 is provided. The shutter panel 2 may include any
    combination and/or arrangement of the standard louver pin 15, the louver tension device 118,
 ,0 the louver closure device 18, the louver damping device 218, 318, and the louver closure and
    damping assembly 418. The louver closure device 18, the louver tension device 118, the
    louver damping device 218, 318, the louver closure and damping assembly 418, or a
    combination thereof may be used in connection with a shutter panel 2 employing a gear rack
    operating system, a pulley operating system, a tilt bar operating system, or other louver
25  operating systems. As the louvers 6 in a shutter panel 2 may be coupled together to move in
    unison (such as by a tilt bar, a gear track system, a pulley system, or other drive system), a
    louver device may be removably attached to one end of a single louver 6, one end of multiple
    louvers, both ends of a single louver, both ends of multiple louvers, or a combination thereof
    If multiple louver devices are individually attached to multiple louvers, the selected louvers
30  may be immediately adjacent one another, evenly distributed throughout the shutter panel, or
    randomly chosen. The louver devices may be attached to a stile, a rail, or other structures of
    the panel. As such, one or more louver devices may be used in connection with a shutter
    panel 2. The number, location, or both of the louver devices may be based on the number of
                                                     '1A

    louvers 6, the weight of the louvers 6, the size (height and width, for example) of the shutter
    panel 2, and other suitable factors.
    [00150]          The components or parts discussed herein may be constructed from various
    types of materials, including metallic and non-metallic materials. In one implementation, the
 5  various housings, rotary cams, cams, and louver pins are made from Lustran@ acrylonitrile
    butadiene styrene (ABS) 433. In one implementation, the various springs are made from
    stainless steel. The components or parts discussed herein may include various surface
    finishes or textures. In one implementation, the various housings, rotary cams, cams, and
    louver pins include a polish of SPI-A2 (Society of Plastics Industry).
 0  [00151]          The foregoing description has broad application. The louver closure,
    damping, and tension assemblies may be incorporated into any type of shutter panel,
    including shutter panels with solid wood frames and hollow vinyl frames. Further, the louver
    closure, damping, and tension assemblies may be used in connection with any type of louver
    actuation system, including gear rack systems, pulley systems, tilt bars, and other louver
 5  actuation systems. Moreover, the louver closure, damping, and tension assemblies may be
    provided as a self-contained module or unit that may be retrofit into existing shutter panels.
    Furthermore, the louver closure, damping, and tension assemblies may include a relatively
    small outer envelope, which may not compromise the integrity of the frame of the shutter
    panel. For example, the louver closure, damping, and tension assemblies may include an
 '0 outer envelope of about one inch in length and about three-eighths of an inch in diameter.
