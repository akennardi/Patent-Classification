                          PLATFORM SUPPORT APPARATUS
       Field of the Invention
   5   This invention concerns platforms and apparatus used to support platforms.         In a
      particular aspect the invention relates to a platform support apparatus for use on a
      pitched roof of a building and platform structures supported by such apparatus.
      Background of the Invention
 10
      Working on a raised sloping surface such as a pitched roof of a building can be
      awkward and dangerous due to the difficulty of maintaining a footing and keeping
      tools at hand and the possibility of injury arising from a fall. In order to overcome
      this problem a roof scaffolding support may be used for supporting a platform in a
 15   horizontal position above the roof.
      Such a roof scaffolding support, which is not admitted to be common general
      knowledge, may comprise a triangular frame having:
              a base arm on or directly adjacent the roof, the base arm being in line with the
20            pitch of the roof,
              an adjustable arm pivotally attached to the downhill end of the base arm, the
              adjustable arm extending upward from the base arm and being lengthwise
              adjustable, and
              a platform support member pivotally attached between the uphill end of the
25            base arm and the top of the adjustable arm.
     In this type of arrangement the platform support member may be adjusted to a
     substantially horizontal position by adjusting the length of the adjustable arm.
     However, this arrangement suffers in that although the angle of the platform support
30   member may be adjusted, the height of the platform support member is unable to be
     raised or lowered independently of the angle adjustment. Furthermore the base arm
     may move around or slide on the pitched roof surface.

                                                2
     It is an object of the present invention to provide a platform and a platform support
     apparatus which limits, overcomes, or reduces the impact of at least one of the
     aforesaid disadvantages.

     be aligned with any of a series of apertures 46 present along the height adjusting arm
 10  32. The top of the height adjusting arm 32 is pivotally attached at 48 to the top of the
     first telescopic part 24 of the angle adjusting arm 5.
     The surface support means 7 comprises a pair of laterally extending feet 49 and 50
     interconnected by a telescopically adjustable intermediate member 52.               The
15   intermediate member 52 has an outer sleeve portion 51 within which slides an inner
     sliding portion 53. An L-handle locking screw 54 extends through the upper wall of
     the outer sleeve portion 51 to clamp against the inner sliding portion 53 and thereby
     lock the intermediate member 52 at the desired length. First and second rising struts,
     60 and 62 respectively, are welded to and extend upward from the outside end of the
20  outer sleeve portion 51, and are joined at their top ends by a spacing strut 64. Each
    foot 49, 50 has a layer of sheet rubber 70 present on its under surface to act as a
    cushion and assist grip.
    The frame fixing means 8 is a clamping assembly. It comprises a first square tubular
25  member 72 having a support holding member 74 welded thereto. The clamping
    assembly 8 has a second square tubular member 76 which slides telescopically within
    the first square tubular member 72, a clamping arm 78 which projects from the base
    of the second square tubular member 76, and a threaded shaft 80 which passes
    longitudinally through tubular members 76 and 72 and extends from both ends
30  thereof. The shaft 80 passes out through an aperture in the top of the first square
    tubular member 72, where the shaft carries an enlarged head 82 which is too wide to
    fit down through the aperture in the top of the first square tubular member 72. The

                                               12
     shaft 80 is threadedly engaged with a nut 110 which is welded to the base of the
     second square tubular member adjacent the clamping member 78.
     Referring to Figure 3, the platform support apparatus 2 is shown in use on a pitched
  5  roof comprising roof tiles 108 laid on timber battens 100 which are fastened across
     underlying rafters 102.
     The distance between the feet 49, 50 can be adjusted by telescopically lengthening or
     shortening (as indicated by arrow 94) the intermediate member 52.            Rotation of
10   locking member 54 in an anti-clockwise direction causes unlocking, allowing
     telescopic adjustment of the intermediate member 52.          To lock the length of the
     intermediate member 52 and therefore the distance between the feet 50, the locking
     member 54 is rotated in a clockwise direction.       The clamp assembly 8 is used to
    retain the platform support apparatus 2 in position on the roof.
15
    In order to attach the apparatus 2 to the roof, the length of the intermediate member is
    first adjusted so that the feet 49, 50 are spaced to be at least close to the centre to
    centre distance between a suitable pair of battens 100a, 100d. As seen in Figure 3,
    there are two further battens 100b, 100c between those battens underlying the feet.
20  The middle tile 108a is displaced upwards so it rests beneath the uphill tile 108b
    underlying uphill foot 49. This creates an opening 107 between the middle tile 108a
    and the downhill tile 108c underlying the downhill foot 50.
    The support holding member 74 of the clamp assembly 8 has a flat main clamping
25  face 114 and a downwardly depending lip 116 along that edge of the member 74
    opposite the tubular member 72, so the member 74 has the form of an upside-down
    channel. As indicated by the arrow 96 in Figure 1, the member 74 is placed over the
    intermediate member 52 so the face 114 bears down on the outer sleeve portion 51,
    the lip 116 overhangs the side of the outer sleeve portion 51, and the second square
30  tubular member 76 extends down through the opening 107 as seen in Figure 3. The
    head 82 of the shaft 80 is rotated to lower the clamping arm 78 until it is able to slip
    under the batten 100c which is immediately downslope of the opening 107.             The
    clamping arm 78 is slid beneath the batten 100c and the head 82 rotated to tighten the

                                               13
     clamping arm 78 up against the underside of the batten 100c, thereby clamping the
     platform support apparatus 2 to the roof.
     In order to mount the platform 87 on to the apparatus 2, the bolts 14 are screwed
  5  upwards and the clamping arm 12 is raised (as indicated by upward arrow 84). An
     end of the plank 86 or planks is/are positioned between the clamping arm 12 and the
     platform support member 10 (as indicated by arrows 88). One end of each plank 86
     is supported by the platform support member 10 shown whilst the other end of each
     plank 86 may be supported by a platform support member of an identical second
 10  platform support apparatus which is laterally spaced from the platform support
     apparatus 2 shown, where respective the feet 49, 50 of both platform support
     apparatuses are substantially in line. The clamping arm 12 is lowered (as indicated
     by downward arrow 84) on to the top surface of the planks 86 and the bolts 14 are
     screwed down so that the planks 86 forming the platform 87 are secured on to the
 15 platform support member 10.
    Figure 4 shows an alternative configuration for the clamp assembly 8 which forms a
    frame fixing means wherein the clamping arm 78 projects out on the same side of the
    square tubular members 72, 76 as does the support holding member 74.              This
20  orientation enables the clamping arm 78 to be clamped to a rafter 102 as shown in
    Figure 5. This is more secure than clamping to a batten as in Figure 3 because the
    batten may not be securely affixed to the rafter. The same clamp assembly 8 may be
    swapped between the configurations in Figures 1 and 4 by unscrewing the shaft 80
    completely from the nut 110, separating the tubular members 72 and 76, and
25  reassembling them in the desired orientation.
    A pair of flanges 83 project from the first square tubular member 72 on the clamp
    assembly 8. As shown in Figure 5, the flanges are used for weather-proofing the roof
    beneath the apparatus. A panel of flexible plastic sheet 112 is used to cover the
30  opening 107 between the tiles in order to prevent rainwater from leaking into the roof
    through the opening 107. The uphill portion of the sheet 112 is held between the
    uphill tiles 108a and 108b, and the downhill portion of the sheet 112 is held between
    the downhill foot 50 and downhill tile 108c. The two parallel flanges 83 are provided

                                              14
   on the first square tubular member 72 so that the plastic sheet may be tucked into the
   channel 85 between the flanges at a level which raises the perforated centre of the
   sheet 112 slightly above the surrounding portions of sheet in order to prevent leakage.
   Optionally a short length of string (not shown) may be wound into and tied into the
 5 channel 85 to secure the sheet 112 to the clamp assembly 8.
   The angle of the platform support member 10 may be adjusted to the horizontal
   position so that the platform is horizontally aligned across the planks. To raise the
   angle of the platform support member 10 toward horizontal, the D-pin 35 through the
10 angle adjusting arm 5 must first be removed. The first telescopic part 24 is slid down
   (as indicated by downwards arrow 90) around the second telescopic part 26 thereby
   shortening the angle adjusting arm. Once a substantially horizontal alignment of the
   platform support arm 10 is reached, the shaft of the D-pin 35 is passed through
   whatever pair of apertures 28, 30 in the first and second telescopic parts 24, 26 is
15 aligned, thereby locking the angle adjusting arm so that the platform support member
    10 remains substantially horizontal.
   Conversely, to lower the angle of the platform support member 10 toward horizontal,
   the first telescopic part 24 is slid up (as indicated by upwards arrow 90) around the
20 second telescopic part 26 thereby lengthening the angle adjusting arm. Again, once a
   suitably horizontal position of the platforms support arm 10 is reached, the D-pin 35
   is inserted into a pair of aligned apertures 28, 30 thereby fixing the length of the angle
   adjusting arm so that the platform support member 10 is held substantially horizontal.
   As the two arrays of holes 28, 30 have different centre to centre spacings, only about
25 every seventh set of four holes is in alignment at any one time. This allows very fine
   adjustment of the length of arm 5, and thus the angle of the platform support member
   which can be set at about 1 increments.
   Either before or after the horizontal aligning of the support member 10, the support
30 member 10 can be vertically adjusted to the desired height by raising or lowering (as
   indicated by arrows 92).       D-pins 40, 44 are first removed to enable the sliding of
   bracket 34 up or down the height adjusting arm 32. The bracket 34 slides on bolt 36
   along the height adjusting arm 32. The bolt 36 remains through the bracket 34 to

                                             15
    keep the bracket captive on the arm 32. The bracket is slid to a position such that the
   notch 38 is located just above a desired aperture 46 in the height adjusting arm 32.
    The D-pin 40 is passed through the desired aperture and the bracket 34 is lowered so
   that the notch 38 fits down around the D-pin 40, thereby preventing the platform
 5  support member 10 from being lowered any further. Another D-pin 44 is then passed
   through the aperture 42 in the lower part of the bracket 34 in order to prevent upward
   tilting of the bracket 34. The downwards load from the platform is taken entirely by
   the D-pin 44 as the bolt 36 and D-pin 44 do not pass through the arm 32.
10  When the platform support apparatus 2 is mounted on a roof clad with corrugated
    steel, it is not convenient to remove a sheet of steel and clamp the apparatus to the
   roof structure. So the apparatus 2 is instead preferably screwed to the roof. This may
   be done without creating any perforations in the steel sheeting further to those
   required for conventional attachment of the sheet to the roof.
15
   In Figure 6, the platform support apparatus 2 is shown in use on a pitched roof
   comprising a corrugated steel sheets 98 supported on roof battens 100 which are
   affixed underlying rafters 102. The length of the intermediate member 52 is adjusted
   so that each foot 50 overlies a batten 100. The feet 49, 50 are spaced to overly
20 respective battens 100 and the screw 54 is tightened slightly so as to allow some
   forced sliding between portions 51 and 53. At the position on the roof desired a few
   screws holding the corrugated steel down are removed and the feet 49, 50 placed over
   the holes so revealed. The base of each foot 49, 50 carries a plurality of slots 56
   adapted to receive screws 58 therethrough. The feet 49 and 50 are then fastened to
25 the battens 100 by screws 58, which are fed through the slots 56 and the existing
   holes in the corrugated steel and into the battens, thereby fixing the platform support
   apparatus 2 in position on the pitched roof. The rubber sheet cushions 70 prevent or
   reduce any damage to the upper surface of the sheet steel , which may be painted.
   The clamp assembly 8 is not needed in this embodiment of the invention.
30
   Figure 7 shows the platform support apparatus 2 in a collapsed position suitable for
   transport and storage. In order to collapse the apparatus 2, D-pins 35, 40, and 44 are
   removed. The sliding bracket 34 is lowered down the height adjusting arm 32, and

                                              16
   the angle adjusting arm 5 is lengthened causing the height adjusting arm 32 to pivot at
    68 down towards a horizontal position. D-pin 32 is then placed through aligned
    apertures 28, 30 of the angle adjusting arm sections 24, 26, thereby locking the angle
   adjusting arm 24, 26 and fixing the apparatus 2 in the collapsed position.           Once
 5 locked, the angle adjusting arm 24, 26 may also be used as a carrying handle for the
   apparatus 2.
