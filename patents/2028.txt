  WATER PIPE WITH SYNCHRONOUSLY RETRACTABLE MULTI-LAYER
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001] The present disclosure belongs to the technical field of retractable water pipes,
and in particular relates to a water pipe with synchronously retractable multi-layer.
BACKGROUND
[0002] In general, water pipes are needed for household car washing or garden watering.
At present, the existing retractable water pipes are composed of an inner pipe at the inner
layer and a fabric sleeve at the outer layer. The shortcomings of the existing retractable
water pipes are as follows: first, the surface of the fabric sleeve at the outer layer is
rough, and when the retractable water pipe is retracted under the effect of water pressure,
the inner pipe rubs against the surface of the fabric sleeve and is prone to be damaged by
friction, so that the service life is shortened; second, sharp gravel particles and plant
prickles on the ground can pierce the fabric sleeve, so that the pressure-resistant effect of
the fabric sleeve is lost, causing that the inner pipe is expanded and ruptured from the
rupture of the fabric sleeve; third, with the broken of the outermost fabric sleeve, the
sharp gravel particles and the plant prickles can directly contact the inner pipe, leading
to the rupture of the inner pipe.
SUMMARY
[0003]   The purpose of the present disclosure is to provide a water pipe with
synchronously retractable multi-layer, which can service for with a long life.
[0004] The object of the present disclosure is achieved by a water pipe with
synchronously retractable multi-layer, comprising: a retractable inner pipe; a fabric
sleeve sleeved outside the inner pipe, which is configured as a retractable cylindrical or
corrugated one- or multi-layer fabric sleeve formed by interweaving retractable elastic
yarns arranged at intervals in the axial direction and non-retractable reinforcing yarns
arranged at intervals in the circumferential direction; and a retractable plastic film layer
interposed between the inner pipe and the fabric sleeve.
[0005]   In some embodiments, an outer surface of the plastic film layer is fit with an
inner surface of the fabric sleeve.
[0006] In some embodiments, the plastic film layer can be deployed or retracted along
with the fabric sleeve.
[0007]   In some embodiments, an inner surface of the plastic film layer is fit with an
                                                1

outer surface of the inner pipe.
[0008] In some embodiments, two ends of the water pipe are respectively connected to
a pipe fitting, on which two ends of the inner pipe, of the fabric sleeve and of the plastic
film layer are respectively fixed.
[0009] In some embodiments, the inner pipe is made of a composition of at least one
retractable material selected from latex, silica gel, TPE(Thermoplastic Elastomer),
TPR(Thermoplastic Rubber), TPU(Thermoplastic polyurethane), and TPX(Transparent
Polymer X).
[0010] In some embodiments, the fabric sleeve is a straight cylindrical or corrugated
one- or multi-layer fabric sleeve woven with chemical fiber threads, cotton threads or
silk threads.
[0011] In some embodiments, the plastic film layer is made of a composition of at least
one retractable material selected from latex, silica gel, TPE, TPR, TPU, TPX,
PE(Polyethylene), PU(Polyurethane) and PP(Polypropylene).
[0012] Compared with the prior art, the present disclosure has the following prominent
and beneficial technical effects.
[0013] Since the retractable plastic film layer with a smooth and low-friction surface is
interposed between the inner pipe and the fabric sleeve, the frictional damage to the
surface of the inner pipe is relatively small, and the contact between the rough-surfaced
fabric sleeve and the inner pipe is blocked, so that the frictional damage to the inner pipe
is reduced, and accordingly the service life of the entire retractable water pipe is
prolonged.
[0014] The additional plastic film layer is made of a retractable material, and when the
inner pipe and the fabric sleeve are retractable synchronously with the change of water
pressure, the plastic film layer can also be retractable synchronously, so that the
frictional damage among multiple layers inside the retractable water pipe structure is
effectively reduced, and the service life of the entire retractable water pipe is prolonged.
[0015] The plastic film layer is also a kind of protective layer, which effectively
protects the inner pipe from being easily damaged by sandstone inclusions and plant
prickles that pierce the fabric sleeve, thereby prolonging the service life of the inner
pipe.
[0016] The pressure bearing strength of the entire retractable water pipe is improved
using the plastic film layer, so that the pressure resistance is increased, and the service
life of the retractable water pipe is further prolonged.

[0017] The present disclosure is applicable to car washing, garden watering, home
cleaning and other occasions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0031] The present disclosure will be further described in detail with reference to the
accompanying drawings.
[0032] Figs. 1 and 2 schematically show an embodiment of a water pipe according to
the present disclosure, in which Fig. 1 is a transversal sectional view and Fig. 2 is an
axial sectional view. As shown in the figures, the water pipe includes a retractable inner
pipe 30, an outer fabric sleeve 10, and a retractable plastic film layer 20 interposed
therebetween.     The fabric sleeve 10 is configured as a retractable cylindrical or
corrugated one- or multi-layer sleeve pipe 10 formed by interweaving retractable elastic
yarns arranged at intervals in the axial direction and non-retractable reinforcing yarns
arranged at intervals in the circumferential direction. The reinforcing yarn consists of a
plurality of reinforcing filaments (for example, chinlon reinforcing filament or dacron
reinforcing filament or coarse denier polypropylene reinforcing filament or nylon 66
high-strength filament, etc.) twisted. In particular, the fabric sleeve 10 forms valleys (i.e.
bottom points in a direction oriented towards the retractable plastic film layer 20) and
peaks (i.e. top points in an opposite direction) in an axial direction of the pipe.
[0033] Under the effect of water pressure, the plastic film layer 20 can be deployed or
retracted along with the fabric sleeve.
[0034]   In this embodiment, an outer surface 21 of the plastic film layer 20 is fit with a
surface 11 of a valley of the corrugated fabric sleeve 10. When the corrugated fabric
sleeve 10 is deployed or retracted, the surface 11 of the valley of the fabric sleeve 10 is
axially slidable on the outer surface 21 of the plastic film layer 20. Due to the small
contact area of the surface 11 of the valley of the fabric sleeve 10 with the plastic film
layer 20 as well as the smooth surface and the low friction of the plastic film layer, the
friction damage to the plastic film layer caused by the fabric sleeve is reduced.
[0035] In other embodiments, the plastic film layer 20 may also be provided as a
retractable corrugated plastic film layer. In this case, the outer surface 21 of the plastic
film layer 20 is fit with the inner surface 12 of the corrugated fabric sleeve 10, and the
bottom surface 22 of the valley of the plastic film layer 20 is fit with the outer surface 31
of the inner pipe 30. In this way, since the plastic film layer has a smooth surface with
low friction, a small, contact surface with the inner pipe, and a configuration fit with the
fabric sleeve, the plastic film layer has almost no friction with respect to the fabric
sleeve 10, and has a very small friction with respect to the inner pipe 30, so that the
                                                 4

damage to the inner pipe 30 due to the friction can be greatly reduced.
[0036] Fig. 3 is another embodiment of the present disclosure, showing an axial
sectional view in which the outer surface of the plastic film layer is fit with the inner
surface of the fabric sleeve. As shown in the figure, the pipe includes a retractable inner
pipe 30, an outer fabric sleeve 10, and a retractable plastic film layer 20 interposed
therebetween. The fabric sleeve 10 is configured as a retractable cylindrical one- or
multi-layer fabric sleeve 10 formed by interweaving retractable elastic yarns arranged at
intervals in the axial direction and non-retractable reinforcing yarns arranged at intervals
in the circumferential direction. Since the elastic yarn of the fabric sleeve 10 disposed in
the axial direction is retractable, and the reinforcing yarn thereof disposed in the
circumferential direction is not retractable, the fabric sleeve 10 can only be retractable in
the axial direction and cannot be deployed or retracted in the radial direction, as the
plastic film layer 20 and the inner pipe 30 are deployed or retracted. It is possible to
prevent effectively the inner pipe 30 from bursting due to large pressure, and thus to
improve the pressure bearing and resistance capability of the water pipe.
[0037] In this embodiment, an outer surface 21 of the plastic film layer 20 is fit with an
inner surface 11 of the fabric sleeve 10, and an inner surface 22 of the plastic film layer
20 is fit with an outer surface 31 of the inner pipe 30. Under the effect of water pressure,
the plastic film layer 20 can be deployed or retracted along with the fabric sleeve 10 and
the inner pipe 30.
[0038] In some embodiments, two ends of the water pipe are respectively connected to
a pipe fitting, on which two ends of the inner pipe 30, of the fabric sleeve 10 and of the
plastic film layer 20 are respectively fixed, so as to facilitate connection to water sources,
spray heads or other multi-layer retractable water pipes.
[0039] In some embodiments, the inner pipe 30 is made of a composition of one or
more retractable materials selected from latex, silica gel, TPE, TPR, TPU, and TPX, and
therefore has good retractility and elasticity.
[0040]    In some embodiments, the fabric sleeve 10 is configured as a straight cylindrical
or corrugated fabric sleeve woven with chemical fiber threads, cotton threads or silk
threads, and therefore has a large supporting force.
[0041] In some embodiments, the plastic film layer is made a composition of one or
more retractable materials selected from latex, silica gel, TPE, TPR, TPU, TPX, PE, PU
and PP, and therefore has good elasticity.
[0042]    In an embodiment where the plastic film layer 20 is not fit with the inner pipe 30,
an inflator may be provided between the outer layer 2 (see Fig. 4), which is formed by
                                                 5

the fabric sleeve 10 and the plastic film layer 20, and the inner pipe 30, so as to further
reduce the friction against the inner pipe 30. After two ends of the inner pipe 30, of the
fabric sleeve 10, and of the plastic film layer 20 are respectively fixed on the pipe fitting,
an enclosed space 3 is formed between the outer layer 2 and the inner pipe 30. As shown
in Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, the inflator is disposed in the enclosed space 3 and located on
the outer layer 2 formed by the fabric sleeve 10 and the plastic film layer 20. A structure
is so provided that, inside the enclosed space 3 is disposed a hollow box 4 independent
of the enclosed space 3, the top wall of the hollow box 4 is the inner sidewall of the outer
layer 2 formed by the fabric sleeve 10 and of the plastic film layer 20, the top wall of the
hollow box 4 and a bottom wall opposite to the top wall are provided with a first opening
5 and a second opening 6 located opposite to each other. An inflation port 7 is also
provided on the fabric sleeve 10.and in the vicinity of the first opening 5. The inflation
port 7 is used to connect to an external gas source 100 (i.e. a device for storing gas
source, such as a gas cylinder commonly used in the prior art, in particular a carbon
dioxide gas cylinder may be used in this embodiment) and to inflate the hollow box 4.
The second opening 6 is provided with a switch member 9 penetrating therethrough, and
the switch member 9 is connected to a second elastic member 91. The second elastic
member 91 serves to urge the switch member 9 to move up and down such that the
second opening 6 is in the open and closed state. The first opening 5 is also provided
with a switch member 8 penetrating therethrough. The switch member 8 is protruded
from the first opening 5 and is extended out of the fabric sleeve 10. The switch member
8 is further connected to a first elastic member 81. The first elastic member 81 serves to
urge the lower end 82 of the switch member 8 to be contacted with or be separated from
the top end 92 of the switch member 9. In this structure, the first opening 5 is always in
the closed state, and when the second elastic member 91 is not deformed, the second
opening 6 is in the closed state.
         [0043] The working principle of the above inflator is that, when the enclosed
space 3 is not inflated, the second opening 6 is in the closed state. At this time, firstly the
external air source 100 is connected to the inflation port 7, and then the switch member 8
is manually pressed down. The switch member 8 may move downward. The lower end
82 of the switch member 8 comes to contact with the top end 92 of the switch member 9.
When the lower end 82 keeps move downward and presses down the switch member 9,
the second elastic member 91 is compressed, and the second opening 6 is in the open
state. The gas valve of the external gas source 100 is opened while the second opening 6
is in the open state, and the external gas source 100 leads to the enclosed space 3 through
the inflation port 7, the hollow box 4 and the second opening 6, thereby realizing the
inflation of the enclosed space 3. After the inflation is completed, the switch member 8
is released, and the first elastic member 81 and the second elastic member 91 are
                                                   6

rebounded under the reaction force, so that the lower end 82 of the switch member 8 is
separated from the top end 92 of the switch member 9. At this time, the switch member 9
moves upward until the second opening 6 is in the closed state. In this case, only the
inflation port 7 needs to be sealed to prevent leakage of gas. In this way, the inflator can
ensure that the elastic inner pipe 30 does not come into contact with the plastic film layer
20 during use of the retractable water pipe.
[0044] After the use of the retractable water pipe, if requiring deflation, the switch
member 8 should be directly pressed, so that the lower end 82 of the switch member8 is
contacted with the top end 92 of the switch member 9. The switch member 8 is further
pressed so that the second elastic member 91 is compressed and the second opening 6 is
opened. At this time, open the inflation port 7directly, the gas filled in the enclosed
space 3 can be released through the second opening 6, the hollow box 4 and the inflation
port 7.
[0045] Of course, in order to prevent the gas from leaking out through the inflation port
7 during inflation, in other embodiments, a one-way inflation valve may be provided on
the inflation port 7, and a deflation port may be further provided on the fabric sleeve 10
and the plastic film layer 20, so that deflation can be achieved.
[0046] In this embodiment, the first opening 5 and the inflating port 7 are both located
on the fabric sleeve 10 and the plastic film layer 20, close to the water outlet port. This
arrangement facilitates the operator to inflate the retractable water pipe immediately
after connecting the retractable water pipe to the water source, and the operation is
quicker and more convenient. The inflator provided at the water outlet port is not
affected by curling and storage of the water pipe, and it can be better maintained.
[0047] In this embodiment, the switch member 8 is composed of a cylinder 83 (a top
end of the cylinder 83 is protruded from the surface of the first opening 5) penetrating
the first opening 5 and of a plate 82 (i.e. lower end of the switch member 8 located inside
the hollow box 4) perpendicular to a lower end of the cylinder 83. The switch member 9
is big at both ends but small in the middle, in which two ends of the switch member 9
can be used to block the second opening 6 so that the second opening 6 is in the closed
state. The top end 92 of the switch member 9 is located inside the hollow box 4, the
lower end 93 of the switch member 9 is located in the enclosed space 3, the first elastic
member 81 (an extended spring in this embodiment) is disposed between the plate 82
and the top wall, and the second elastic member 91 (a compressed spring in this
embodiment) is disposed between the top end 92 of the switch member 9 and the bottom
wall.
[0048]    In this embodiment, when the second opening 6 is in the open state (that is,
                                                 7

during the deformation of the second elastic member 91 from minimum deformation to
maximum deformation), the lower end 93 of the switch member 9 does not come into
contact with the elastic inner pipe 30 (in this embodiment, the distance between the
lower end 93 of the switch member 9 and the inner pipe 30 is 0.1 ~ 0.2 cm), so that the
wear of the inner pipe caused by the friction between the switch member 9 and the inner
pipe 30 is avoided.
[0049] Fig. 10 shows a variation of the inflator. As shown in Fig. 10, in this
embodiment, the inflation port 7 and the external gas source 100 above mentioned are
further improved as follows. The inflation port 7 is provided with an internal thread 111
and a steel needle 122, and the steel needle 122 is provided with a gas inlet. The steel
needle 122 is hollow, and the gas inlet is communicated with the hollow region 121 of
the steel needle 122 and with the hollow box 4. The external gas source 100 used in this
embodiment is a portable small or tiny gas cylinder. When a portable small or tiny gas
cylinder is used as an external gas source, the inflation principle thereof is as follows.
Since the portable small or tiny gas cylinder is provided with an external thread, the
external thread on the portable small or tiny gas cylinder is directly screwed cooperated
with the internal thread 111 on the inflation port 7 during the use. During the screwing,
the steel needle 122 on the inflation port 7 pierces the portable small or tiny gas cylinder,
so that the gas inside the portable small or tiny gas cylinder is released and enters the
hollow box 4 via the hollow region 121, thereby also achieving the inflation of the
enclosed space 3 (as shown in Fig. 11). In this way, the inner pipe 30 does not come into
contact with the plastic film layer 20. After the watering is completed, the deflation of
the enclosed space 3 can be achieved by unscrewing the portable small or tiny gas
cylinder.
[0050] In a preferred embodiment, a magnetization device may also be provided on the
aforementioned water pipe to achieve the magnetization of the water flowing through the
water pipe. Figs. 12 and 13 illustrate a water pipe for magnetized water with
synchronously retractable multi-layer, in which the plastic film layer 20 is of a
corrugated shape fit with the fabric sleeve 10.
[0051] As shown in Fig. 12, around the inner pipe 30 is sleeved a first magnetic
member, which is located between the plastic film layer 20 and the inner pipe 30.
[0052] In this embodiment, the first magnetic member is an induction coil 300, which is
sleeved on the inner pipe 30. The terminal of the induction coil 300 is led by means of a
wire into the pipe fitting 400. The length of the wire shall be longer than the length of
the fabric sleeve 10 after extended, to ensure that the induction coil 300 is not damaged
when the fabric sleeve 10 is deployed. A gap is left between the induction coil 300 and
                                                 8

the inner pipe 30 to ensure that the normal operation of the induction coil 300 is not
affected when the inner pipe 30 is deployed or retracted. In this embodiment, the number
of turns of the induction coil 300 is selected to be 20, and the magnetic field strength is
15,000 oersteds. In other embodiments, the number of turns and the magnetic field
strength of the induction coil 300 may be adjusted according to the magnetization
requirement and the length of the inner pipe 30. The induction coil 300 generates a
magnetic field after energized, which can magnetize the water in the inner pipe 30. In the
magnetized water, the original associative chain-like macromolecules are broken into
individual small molecules, which break through the previously connected "molecular
clusters" and become individual viable water molecules, so that the water becomes
activated, and the biological activity is enhanced. The magnetized water can stimulate
the flower plants themselves and promote photosynthesis and metabolism. Furthermore,
the magnetized water can accelerate the conversion of organic phosphorus and organic
nitrogen in the soil into available phosphorus and available nitrogen that can be absorbed
by flower plants, and can increase the fertility of the soil, thus promoting the dark green
color, the thick stems and the developed root system of the flowers and improving their
cold resistance and resistance to pests and diseases. In other embodiments, the first
magnetic member may also be a cylindrical magnet, which may be sleeved around the
inner pipe 30. A gap is left between the cylindrical magnet and the inner pipe 30 to
ensure that the cylindrical magnet is not affected when the inner pipe 30 is deployed or
retracted.
[0053] The installation position of the induction coil 300 may be located at the peak of
the fabric sleeve 10 and of the plastic film layer 20, and a protective pipe may be sleeved
around the induction coil 300 to ensure that the induction coil 300 is not affected when
the fabric sleeve 10 is deployed or retracted.
[0054] As shown in Fig. 12, the number of the induction coils 300 is two, and two
induction coils 300 are respectively sleeved on the left and right ends of the inner pipe
30. The terminal of the left induction coil 300 is led by means of a wire into the left pipe
fitting 400, and the terminal of the right induction coil 300 is led by means of a wire into
the right pipe fitting 400. The length of the induction coil 300 may be one-tenth of the
length of the inner pipe 30 in the natural state, and it ensures the magnetization effect of
the water by the induction coil 300. In other embodiments, the number, the arrangement
and the length of the induction coil 300 can be adaptively varied based on the
magnetization requirement and the length of the water pipe.
[0055] As shown in Fig. 12, in this embodiment, the power supply of the induction coil
300 adopts a rechargeable battery 600 that is electrically connected to the terminal of the
induction coil 300 and provides electrical energy for the induction coil 300, wherein the
                                                9

rechargeable battery 600 is provided with a switch. The rechargeable battery 600 is
installed inside the pipe fitting 400. The pipe fitting 400 is provided with a charging hole
and an operating switch. In this case, the pipe fitting 400 can be customized, and the
rechargeable battery 600 is waterproof-integrated in the pipe fitting 400. In other
embodiments, the rechargeable battery 600 may also be directly mounted on the
periphery of the pipe fitting 400. In other embodiments, the induction coil 300 can be
directly connected to the power line, and the power line passes through the fabric sleeve
10 and the plastic film layer 20 and is electrically connected to the terminal of the
induction coil 300. A socket of the power line may be installed on the fabric sleeve 3.
When the magnetization of water is required by the user, one end of the power line is
inserted directly into the socket of the power line on the fabric sleeve 3. The plug of the
power line is connected to the external power socket to provide electric energy for the
induction coil 4. When the magnetization of water is not required, the power line is not
installed. In this way, it may provide two options of magnetization or non-magnetization
for the user.
[0056] As shown in Fig. 12, a method for flower watering using the water pipe of the
present disclosure is disclosed, comprising: mounting one pipe fitting 400 on the faucet;
mounting another pipe fitting 400 on the spray gun; turning on the faucet, while
energizing the induction coil 300 (by pressing the operating switch on the pipe fitting
400) to magnetize the water in the inner pipe 30. The user can also perform a power cut
as needed, without magnetizing the water.
[0057] Fig. 13 schematically shows a structure of a water pipe for magnetized water
with synchronously retractable multi-layer according to another embodiment of the
present disclosure.
[0058] As shown in Fig. 13, in comparison with the embodiment shown in Fig. 12, the
water pipe in this embodiment further includes a second magnetic member 500 installed
inside the pipe fitting 400 for further magnetizing the passing water. In this embodiment,
the second magnetic member 500 also adopts an induction coil, wherein the number of
turns of the induction coil is selected to be 15, and the magnetic field strength is 15,000
oersteds. In other embodiments, the number of turns and the magnetic field strength of
the induction coil may be adjusted according to the magnetization requirement and the
channel size of the pipe fitting 400. The induction coil surrounds the periphery of the
water flow channel inside the pipe fitting 400. The rechargeable battery 600 is
electrically connected to the terminal of the second magnetic member 500 (the induction
coil), and the rechargeable battery 600 supplies the induction coil with electric energy.
In this case, the pipe fitting 400 needs customization, and the induction coil is
waterproof-integrated in the pipe fitting 400. In other embodiments, the second magnetic
                                                10

member may also adopt a cylindrical magnet that surrounds the water flow channel
inside the pipe fitting 400 or the periphery of the water flow channel.
[0059] As shown in Fig. 13, a method for flower watering using the water pipe of the
present disclosure is disclosed, comprising: mounting one pipe fitting 400 on the faucet;
mounting another pipe fitting 400 on the spray gun; turning on the faucet, while
energizing the induction coil 300 and the second magnetic member 500 (by pressing the
operating switch on the pipe fitting 400). After water is passed through the inner pipe 30,
the induction coil 300 and the second magnetic member 500 (induction coil) may
magnetize the water in the inner pipe 30. The user can also perform a power cut as
needed, without magnetizing the water.
[0060] In other embodiments, the first magnetic member and the second magnetic
member may also be disposed between the plastic film layer 20 and the fabric sleeve 10
(e.g. in an embodiment, the plastic film layer 20 is fit with the inner tube 30 but is not fit
with the fabric sleeve 10).
[0061] The various features in the above embodiments of the present disclosure may be
applied individually or in any combination. The present disclosure does not limit specific
combinations.
[0062] The above description only refers to some embodiments of the present
disclosure. For a person of ordinary skill in the art, several variations and improvements
may be made without departing from the concept of the present disclosure, and these are
all within the protection scope of the present disclosure.
