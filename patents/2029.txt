The present disclosure relates to a new pharmaceutical composition comprising Ceritinib.
Particularly it is directed to the tablet that is prepared by wet granulation, wherein povidone is
used as a binder. Further feature of the composition is that the drug and the binder form the
inner phase, whereas all other excipients are added in a powder form as an outer phase. This
way, the sticking of the composition is prevented and sufficient tablet hardness can be reached.

Ceritinib formulation
This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2015265470, the entire content of which
is incorporated herein by reference.
Field of the disclosure
The present disclosure relates to a new pharmaceutical composition comprising Ceritinib. It further relates
to a tablet comprising Ceritinib and a process of preparing said tablet. In addition, the disclosure also related
to a use of the pharmaceutical composition or the tablet.
Background of the invention
W02008/073687 Al disclosed ceritinib (also named LDK378) as compound 66 in Example 7. Chemical
formula of ceritinib is 5-chloro-N 2-(2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl)phenyl)-N 4 -[2-(propane-2
sulfonyl)-phenyl]-pyrimidine-2,4-diamine.
Ceritinib is an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor. ALK is a member of the insulin receptor
superfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases. Genetic alterations of ALK have been implicated in oncogenesis in
hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tumours. The gene has been found to be rearranged, mutated, or
amplified in a series of tumours, including non-small cell lung cancer. Ceritinib has been approved by the US
FDA as Zykadia* for the treatment of patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib. The approved
dosage is a daily dose of 750mg administered orally, with possible dose reduction in 150mg increment(s) to
600mg and 450mg as needed. The minimum treatment dose is 300mg. The approved dosage form is a
capsule of size 00 containing a 150 mg dose of ceritinib.
Summary of the invention
Ceritinib is a difficult compound to formulate. In water, it exhibits solubility of only 0.02 mg/mL (at 25*C),
and together with its low permeability according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System qualifies for a
class IV compound. In addition, physical characteristics of Ceritinib cause sticking and picking during
tableting or encapsulation of the drug and make it poorly compressible. Furthermore, the drug is
administered at a high dose of 750 mg, which would require a patient to take daily up to 5 units of 150 mg. If
the dose is to be increased in a respective dosage form, the increase in drug load generally negatively affects
the compressibility of a tablet. Ceritinib's sticky nature causes a high drug load to further negatively
influence the manufacturing of tablets due to enhanced sticking/picking.
Surprisingly it was found that a high drug load of more than 40 weight percent, preferably more than 45 wt
%, more preferably more than 50 wt%, particularly 60 wt% of Ceritinib in a tablet can be achieved by using a
specifically adapted wet granulation process, whereby solely the pharmaceutical active ingredient ceritinib is
granulated with a binder. Said wet granulation process also leads to high compressibility and much reduced
or even no sticking and picking during manufacturing. The latter can be further improved by adding the right
amount of a lubricant, such as for example magnesium stearate. The tablet obtained by employing the
disclosed process exhibits suitable hardness and reduced friability.
                                                              - 1-

     WO 2015/181739                                                                PCT/IB2015/053966
Also of importance is the high drug load of pharmaceutical composition that can be reached. For
example, the table can comprise for example 70 % by weight of the drug substance. The tablet can be
thus of an acceptable size that is more convenient for patients to swallow, even if containing doses up to
375 mg or more. Compared to the capsule, the in vitro dissolution profiles predict that the tablet can
also behave in vivo comparably to capsule. The compliance of taking the new formulation is expected to
be much improved compared to the one of a capsule given the high daily dose that needs to be
administered and inconvenient size of a capsule.
Therefore, one aspect of the present disclosure is a pharmaceutical composition comprising more than
40 and up to 70 weight percent of Ceritinib based on the total weight of the pharmaceutical
composition. Further the disclosure provides a tablet comprising Ceritinib obtainable by preparing
granules comprising Ceritinib and a binder by wet granulation, mixing the granules with at least one
pharmaceutical excipient to obtain a mixture, and compressing the mixture in the tablet.
The pharmaceutical composition and the tablet according to the present disclosure can be used as a
medicine. Another aspect of the disclosure is a process of preparing a tablet comprising Ceritinib,
wherein the process comprises wet granulation of Ceritinib and a binder, and a compression step.

Detailed description of the invention
It was found that a tablet comprising a high-drug load of Ceritinib with sufficient tablet hardness and
without sticking/picking during the manufacturing can only be manufactured by wet granulation. Direct
compression and roller compaction did not yield satisfactory results. The problem was encountered that
by using direct compression and roller compaction, and to a lesser extent a "standard" wet granulation
formulation, where substantially all excipients are blended together with a pharmaceutically active
ingredient and together wet granulated, the physical properties of the final blend showed a very narrow
compressibility window and led to tablets with very poor cohesion properties, bad friability results and
still sticking and capping on both surfaces. On the other hand, wet granulation of Ceritinib only with a
binder was easy to process and provided pharmaceutical composition with significantly improved
compressibility and no sticking and resulted in tablets with reduced friability. A pharmaceutical
composition comprising more than 40 and up to 70 weight percent of Ceritinib based on the total
                                                      7

weight of the pharmaceutical composition, or weight percent of Ceritinib based on the total weight of
the pharmaceutical composition was easily obtained. Other drug loads, such as at least 45 and up to 70,
50 and up to 70, at least 55 and up to 65, or particularly 60 weight percent of Ceritinib based on the
total weight of the pharmaceutical composition, can also be prepared. When calculating the Ceritinib
content based on the total weight of a pharmaceutical composition, which is a capsule, weight of the
capsule shell is included in the total weight of the pharmaceutical composition. In case where the
pharmaceutical composition is a coated tablet, only the tablet core should be taken into account, i.e. the
total weight of the pharmaceutical composition is the uncoated tablet.
Specifically, ceritinib drug substance can be wet granulated using one pharmaceutically acceptable
excipient, a binder, which can be added to the drug substance in a dissolved state (e.g. in an aqueous
solution) or in a powder form and then granulated by adding a granulation liquid. A combination of
more than one binder can be used. The wet granulation can be performed using a standard high shear
granulator to form drug wet granules. The solvents used for wet granulation can be for example water,
or low alkyl alcohols like ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, ethers, or mixtures thereof. The wet granules
comprising Ceritinib and the binder are subsequently dried. The material can be dried by using for
example a fluid bed drier. Removing substantially all granulation liquid can be advantageous in terms of
reducing unnecessary stickiness of the granulation mass due to the remaining granulation liquid. The
obtained granules can be also calibrated, which can be achieved by a sieving method or the like, for
example by using an oscillating sieve.
The binder used for wet granulation of the active ingredient can be a polymer that is otherwise suitable
pharmaceutically acceptable binder or a coating polymer. Particularly suitable binders are for example
starches, such as for example potato, wheat or corn starch, Hypromellose (named also
Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), Hydroxypropyl cellulose, Hydroxy ethyl cellulose, Povidone (named also
Polyvinylpyrrolidone), Copovidone (also named copolyvidone), Gelatine and Polymethacrylates. By using
the wet granulation process for granulating Ceritinib with mainly the binder, the compressibility and
stickiness are immensely improved. In one embodiment the binder is povidone. By specifically selecting
Povidone as a binder the friability of the final tablet can be further improved.
The overall characteristics of the pharmaceutical composition are further enhanced, if the drug-binder
granules form an inner phase, and additional pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are added to the
blend as an outer phase. This way, the stickiness of the composition can be further reduced. The
composition can contain further pharmaceutical excipients, which can be in the outer phase, or
elsewhere, and can be pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as filler, disintegrant, glidant, and/or
lubricant, or mixture thereof. Further excipients like antioxidants, sweetening agents, flavoring agents,
dyes, and the like and combinations thereof can also be added. The composition can comprise one or
more fillers, for example a microcrystalline cellulose, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, lactose
(anhydrous, monohydrate), starch, mannitol, sorbitol, calcium phosphate (dibasic anhydrous, dibasic
hydrate, tribasic), isomalt, sucrose, Hydroxypropyl Cellulose Low-substituted; one or more disintegrants,
for example Croscarmellose Sodium, Crospovidone, Sodium starch glycolate, microcristalline cellulose,
silicified microcrystalline cellulose, Hydroxypropyl Cellulose Low-substituted, cellulose powdered;

further binders, such as for example starch, Hydroxypropyl Cellulose Low-substituted, Hypromellose
(Hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), Hydroxypropyl cellulose, Hydroxy ethyl cellulose, Povidone
(Polyvinylpyrrolidone ), Copovidone (Copolyvidone), gelatine, polymethacrylates; one or more glidants,
for example Silica, colloidal silica, talc, hydrophobic colloidal silica, magnesium silicate; or one or more
lubricants, for example Magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, glyceryl mono fatty acid,
glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl dibehenate, glyceyryl palmito stearic ester, or polyoxyethylen glycol; or
mixtures thereof. They can be added in a powder form, as separately granulated granules, or dissolved
in a fluid, which can then be substantially removed by drying throughout the process, or added after
going through the process of briquetting or slugging, and optionally sieving. Excipient "in a dry powder
form" or "dry excipient" mean herein that an excipient is substantially free of water or moisture,
preferably the excipient is dry. Using only dry excipients in the outer phase normally does not worsen
the sticking and picking problem and can even improve it.
Some excipients can act as a binder, filler and/or a disintegrant, depending on their content in the blend,
coexisting excipients and how and when they are formulated in the formulation. It is completely in the
purview of a pharmaceutical technologist to understand the role of a pharmaceutical excipient in the
composition. He will be able to assess the role of the excipient in the pharmaceutical composition or the
dosage form based on the characteristics he wants to achieve, such as volume, hardness, dissolution
profile etc, of a pharmaceutical composition or a dosage form. The outer phase comprising one or more
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients is mixed with the inner phase (granulate) using e.g. a free fall
mixer. In one embodiment, the outer phase comprises Cellulose Microcristalline as filler, Hydroxypropyl
Cellulose Low-substituted as dry binder and Croscarmellose Sodium as disintegrant. The formulation
may also contain one glidant, most preferably colloidal silicon dioxide.
Adding Hydroxypropyl cellulose low substituted in the outer phase further helps reduce friability of the
tablets obtained from the pharmaceutical composition. The content of Hydroxypropyl cellulose low
substituted in the outer phase can be around 5 wt % based on the on the total weight of the
pharmaceutical composition. Hydroxypropyl cellulose low substituted differs from Hydroxypropylmethyl
cellulose (HPMC, hypromellose) or even plain Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC). The latter two polymers
are water soluble and can be used as binders for granulation, in which case they normally get dissolved
in the granulation liquid. In alternative, they are simply added to the mass in powder form and dissolve
and intertwine the granulation mixture during granulation process. On the other hand, Hydroxypropyl
cellulose low substituted is much less water soluble. Friability can be measured by a friability test as
described in the   8 th Edition of European Pharmacopoeia (version 8.1) by using the tablet friability
apparatus. The friability of uncoated tablet cores is measured, as coated tablets normally do not show
any friability. Generally, the method measures weight loss of tablets after mechanical stress has been
applied to them. A drum of predefined measurements is rotated 100 times with 10 tablets (depending
on the tablet mass) that have been carefully dedusted and accurately weighted before the testing. After
rotations, the tablets are cleaned of any loose dust and again weighted. Maximum loss of mass not
greater than 1 % is considered acceptable. The prescribed test for friability of uncoated tablets of Eu. Ph.
Ed. 8 (8.1) defines additional specifics.

To the pharmaceutical composition, a lubricant, preferably magnesium stearate, can be added to further
counter the sticking of the blend. The amount of the lubricant in the pharmaceutical composition can be
at least 0.5 and up to 3 weight percent, preferably at least 1 and up to 2 weight percent, particularly 1.5
weight percent based on the total weight of the pharmaceutical composition. The lubricant is preferably
magnesium stearate. In one alternative, instead of increasing the amount of the lubricant to the
pharmaceutical composition, it can be sprayed and deposited on the material contacting surfaces of
pressing tools, e.g. punches and /or dies of the tableting machine before compression. The amount of
lubricant impacts the compressibility, hardness, friability and dissolution profile of the final dosage form,
i.e. tablet. Higher is the amount of a lubricant, lower are the compressibility and hardness, but friability
increases. The lubricant reduces sticking of the blend, but does not influence the dissolution to the
extent that would change the bioequivalence remains the same.
The pharmaceutical composition is then processed to prepare a final dosage form - a tablet. This can be
achieved by compressing the final blend for example on a rotary tablet press. Tablet of different shapes
can be prepared (round, ovaloid, or other suitable shape). The pharmaceutical formulation or the tablet
can have further layers and coatings. One possible coating can be for example a colour coating. The
shape, the final mass and the drug load dictate the dosage strength of the tablet. The tablet can contain
for example a 150 mg dose of ceritinib. Given the high drug load, the tablet of the present disclosure can
contain at least 150 and up to 750 mg, preferably is at least 300 mg and up to 375 mg. The tablet can
have 300 mg Ceritinib. In one specific embodiment, which is preferred, the Ceritinib dose in the tablet is
375 mg. Increasing the dose in a single unit dosage form reduces the daily pill burden compared to the
approved capsule formulation dosing regimen.
In one embodiment, the tablet of 150 mg strength has a hardness of at least 45 N, but preferably has at
least 50 N. Tablets exhibiting hardness of between 50 and 82 N, preferably between 58 and 72 N, most
preferably between 64 and 71N, measured by tablet hardness tester as described in European
Pharmacopeia Ed. 8 (version 8.1 in chapter 2.9.8 titled Resistance to crushing of tablets. In summary,
tablets are placed between the jaws of the apparatus. The jaws move towards each other and crush the
tablet. The apparatus records the force needed to crush the tablet with a precision of 1 Newton (1 N).
For tablets comprising more than 300 mg Ceritinib, e.g. 300 mg or 375 mg, hardness of 100 N or more is
desired, preferably hardness of 150 N or more. Tablet hardness does not grow indefinitely, but normally
increases to a certain plateau, and does not increase anymore with increased compression force. The
hardness and the content of the lubricant, e.g. magnesium stearate is linked to the dissolution profile.
The composition of the present disclosure can achieve comparable dissolution profile of the FDA
approved capsules. Therefore, it is expected that the present composition may achieve at least the same
therapeutic effect as currently approved Ceritinib capsules.
The tablet comprising Ceritinib can be prepared by wet granulation. Particularly the process of preparing
the tablet comprises the steps of: a) Preparing granules comprising Ceritinib and a binder by wet
granulation, b) mixing the granules with at least one other pharmaceutical excipient to obtain a mixture,
and c) compressing the mixture in the tablet. However, all excipients can be wet granulated with the
active and compressed in the tablet. The steps a), b) and c) of the process can be employed as described
                                                     10

    WO 2015/181739                                                                   PCT/IB2015/053966
above. Mixing in step b) can be carried out in the absence of any granulation liquid, so that the blend
obtained is substantially dry. This can help reduce the sticking and picking problem of Ceritinib. The
process can further comprise the steps of calibrating the granule size, depositing a lubricant on the
surfaces of a pressing tool, particularly tableting machine punches, and/or coating a tablet. Calibrating
the granule size can be achieved by sieving. Extra fine particles and bulky granules can be removed to
improve flowability of the granules in bulk. Coating can be film coating and can be obtained by spraying
the solution or a suspension of a coating polymer on the tablet cores. Optionally the coating solution or
suspension comprises further excipients such as a colorant or plasticizer. The coating can take place for
example in a coating drum or a wurster apparatus.
The process is suited to prepare tablets comprising at least 150 and up to 750 mg Ceritinib. Preferably
the dose of Ceritinib is at least 150 mg and up to 375 mg, including 300 mg. In one embodiment, the
Ceritinib dose is 150 mg. In another preferred embodiment, the dose is 375 mg. In another
embodiment, the dose is 300 mg. Magnesium stearate improves the processability and can be added to
the pharmaceutical mixture for tableting in at least 0.5 and up to 3 weight percent based on the total
weight of the mixture, at least 1 and up to 2 weight percent, preferably at least 1.3 and up to 1.7 weight
percent, particularly 1.5 weight percent of magnesium stearate based on the total weight of the
mixture. The process is suitable to yield tablets with high drug load. Tablets with even 70 weight percent
of active ingredient can be prepared. Also other percent ranges of the active can be easily obtained, for
example the tablet with at least 40 and up to 70 weight percent of Ceritinib, preferably at least 45 or 50
and up to 70 weight percent, more preferably at least 55 and up to 65 weight percent, particularly 60
weight percent of Ceritinib based on the total weight of the uncoated tablet. When appropriate amount
of a lubricant, e.g. magnesium stearate, is added, the process leads to a tablet with hardness of at least
45 N for a tablet comprising at least 150 mg Ceritinib and less than 300 mg. The hardness of said tablet
can be between 50 and 82 N, preferably between 58 and 72 N, most preferably is between 64 and 71N.
Tablets with larger dose, e.g. with doses of 300 mg or more, e.g. up to 750 mg, particularly 375 mg,
should have harness of 100 N or more, preferably of 150 N or more.
The pharmaceutical composition or the tablet according to the present disclosure can be used as a
medicine. Ceritinib is primarily indicated for the treatment of patients with a proliferative disease. The
proliferative disease according to the present disclosure can be cancer. The cancer includes lung cancer.
In one embodiment the proliferative disease is a non-small cell lung cancer, particularly is. The
descriptor ALK-positive refers to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) being mutated in a way that leads to
activation or higher activity of ALK compared to the activity of the wild type ALK or ALK in a healthy
control. The pharmaceutical composition or the tablet can be used to treat ALK-positive non-small cell
lung cancer, wherein the cancer has progressed on or is intolerant to crizotinib. In the same manner the
pharmaceutical composition or the tablet can be used for the manufacture of the medicament,
particularly for the treatment of the aforementioned diseases. Equally, the method of treating a patient
in need of ceritinib, the method comprising administering the pharmaceutical composition or the tablet
according of the present disclosure is also contemplated herein.

Examples 1 to 3A: Appropriate formulation technology
It was determined during the formulation preworks that all formulations tested showed very significant
sticking issues during a tableting step. The sticking issue was occurring at all three tested common
manufacturing       processes      for    tablets,    either     direct    blending/compression,      roller
compaction/compression or wet granulation/compression. However, the sticking issue was significantly
reduced using wet granulation. In addition, the wet granulation approach allowed loading of the highest
amount of drug. Roller compaction and direct compression did not result in an appropriate tablet or an
acceptable manufacturing process, leading to the conclusion to that these technologies could not be
selected.
For direct compression (example 1) all listed excipients except magnesium stearate were blended, then
Mg-stearate was added and the mix blended again and compressed.
Roller compaction approach (dry granulation) shown in example 2 was done by blending LDK378 drug
substance, Mannitol, and a portion of Cellulose microcrystalline, Crospovidone, Colloidal silica and Mg
stearate as an inner phase and dry compacting it, while another portion of Cellulose microcrystalline,
Crospovidone, Colloidal silicon dioxide and Mg-stearate was added as the extra-granular phase, mixed
with the granules and compressed.
Wet granulation (example 3) was done by using LDK378 drug substance, Mannitol, Hypromellose and a
portion of Cellulose microcrystalline and Croscarmellose Sodium as an inner phase, while using the rest
of Cellulose microcrystalline, Croscarmellose-Sodium together with Colloidal silicon dioxide and Mg
stearate as an extra granular phase.

   In an additional development step, the impact of the choice of a binder for a wet granulation phase was
   determined. Hypromellose and povidone were selected for testing out of several binder types (starch
   based binders, povidone based binders, copovidone based binders, hypromellose based binders,
   hydroxypropylcellulose based binders and hydroxyethylcellulose based binders) (cf. examples 4 and 5 in
   table 2). A binder for wet granulation can be added either in a dry state to the granulation mixture
   (granule phase) before the wet granulation is conducted with water or the binder can be dissolved in
   e.g. water to form a granulation liquid, which is then used to conduct the wet granulation of the
   granulation mixture. The granulation mixture can consist of a drug substance and several excipients (e.g.
   filler, disintegrant and/or other excipients) which are granulated together with the applied binder
   (examples 4 and 5). However, a specifically modified approach was taken, by which only the drug and
   the binder got wet granulated and represent an inner phase, whereas the remainder of pharmaceutical
   excipients was added afterwards as an outer phase (example 6). In this novel granulation process, only
   drug substance (without any additional excipients) was granulated using dissolved povidone as the
   binder. The obtained drug substance granules were blended with the outer phase and compressed into
   tablets.

  The choice of the binder type did not significantly improve the compressibility. However, povidone did
  improve the friability. A significant improvement of the compressibility was achieved by direct
  granulation of the LDK378 drug substance with dissolved povidone. After drying of the wet granules, all
  other excipients were added as the outer phase and compressed into tablets. The tablet hardness during
  compression significantly improved, although a similar or lower compression force was used, which was
  an unexpected improvement. This good compressibility of LDK378 film-coated tablets was achieved by
  using the novel granulation technique, whereby solely drug substance and povidone as the binder were
  granulated. The tablets disintegrated within 15 minutes, which meet the requirement for immediate
  release tablets.
  In addition, the superior compressibility was demonstrated, which can be observed by plotting the
  tablet hardness versus the applied compression force (Fig. 1).
  Examples 7 to 9: Excipients for an improved outer phase
  The tablets were prepared by the specific wet granulation process comparable to Example 6. Soluble
  filler mannitol in the outer phase was replaced by higher amount of microcrystalline cellulose and an
  additional dry binder was added to the outer phase. Two different dry binders, Hydroxypropyl Cellulose
  Low-substituted and Copovidone were evaluated at 5% level in the outer phase (see example 8 and 9).
  The friability went from 0.65% to 0.11% when using Hydroxypropyl Cellulose Low-substituted. Overall,
  these formulation     development activities      led to reduced tablet friability and further increase
  compressibility.

* LDK378 (Ceritinib) and povidone were granulated alone, and subsequently mixed with the remaining
excipients (outer phase).
Examples 10 to 12: Lubricant content
The tablets were prepared by the specific wet granulation process comparable to Example 6, with only
Ceritinib (LDK378) and the binder being granulated and making the inner phase. The sticky nature of
LDK378 drug substance was observed. Trials on direct compression and roller compaction (see example
1 and 2) failed due to strong sticking during manufacturing. Solely by implementing wet granulation
technology, the sticking tendency was reduced to a minimum             (see examples 3A and 3B). The
implementation of the novel granulation technology, whereby drug substance is directly granulated with
a binder to form the inner phase of granules, further reduced observed stickiness to a minimum.
Nevertheless, the amount of lubricant can further reduce the stickiness during compression.

Examples 10-12 demonstrate the need for adequate lubrication of the composition. Above lubrication
levels of 1.3%, the sticking is reduced to a minimum and at 1.5% no sticking was observed. However,
examples 10-12 also demonstrate the impact of high lubrication on the compressibility and friability,
whereby both, the compressibility as well as the friability can be negatively impacted by higher amounts
of a lubricant. As shown in example 12, a stable manufacturing process was achieved by the novel
granulation technology       together with      the adapted    outer phase      and the optimized       lubricant
concentration, leading to a formulation and process resulting in a tablet with suitable compressibility
and friability, while no sticking occurs during manufacturing.

In addition, comparative dissolution profiles of formulations from examples 10, 11 and 12 demonstrate
that the lubricant content does not significantly affect the dissolution (cf. Figures 2 to 5). Based on these
results it can be expected that film coated tablets and capsules of LDK378 show similar results in-vivo
during bridging or bioequivalence studies.
Examples 13 to 18: Non-limiting examples and dissolution profiles
The manufacturing process for LDK378 150 mg tablet (optionally film-coated) is as follows:
Granulation:
1. Fill LDK378 drug substance into the high shear granulator and mix.
2. Dissolve povidone in water to prepare the granulation liquid.
3. Add povidone solution from step 2 to the granulator for wetting and kneading to prepare
the granules.
4. Dry the obtained granules from step 3 in a fluid bed dryer.
5. Sieve the dried granules from step 4. In one variant, the sieve can have mesh with openings of 0.8
mm.
Final blend:
6. Sieve and add microcrystalline cellulose, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose,
