                                         BACKGROUND
         Bromodomains refer to conserved protein structural folds which bind to N-acetylated
lysine residues that are found in some proteins. The BET family of bromodomain containing
proteins is comprised of four members (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDt). Each member of
the BET family employs two bromodomains to recognize N-acetylated lysine residues found
primarily, but not exclusively, on the amino-terminal tails of histone proteins. These
interactions modulate gene expression by recruiting transcription factors to specific genome
locations within chromatin. For example, histone-bound BRD4 recruits the transcription
factor P-TEFb to promoters, resulting in the expression of a subset of genes involved in cell
cycle progression (Yang et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 28: 967-976 (2008)). BRD2 and BRD3 also
function as transcriptional regulators of growth promoting genes (LeRoy et al., Mol. Cell 30:
51-60 (2008)). BET family members were recently established as being important for the
maintenance of several cancer types (Zuber et al., Nature 478: 524-528 (2011); Mertz et al;
Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. 108: 16669-16674 (2011); Delmore et al., Cell 146: 1-14, (2011);
Dawson et al., Nature 478: 529-533 (2011)). BET family members have also been
implicated in mediating acute inflammatory responses through the canonical NF-KB pathway
(Huang et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 29: 1375-1387 (2009)) resulting in the upregulation of genes
associated with the production of cytokines (Nicodeme et al., Nature 468: 1119-1123,
(2010)). The human immunodeficiency virus utilizes BRD4 to initiate transcription of viral
RNA from stably integrated viral DNA (Jang et al., Mol. Cell, 19: 523-534 (2005). Thus,
compounds that inhibit the binding of BET family bromodomains to their cognate acetylated
lysine proteins are being pursued for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory diseases and some
viral infections. Accordingly, there is an ongoing medical need to develop new drugs to treat
these indications.

a). Definitions
        It is noted that, as used in this specification and the intended claims, the singular form
"a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
Thus, for example, reference to "a compound" includes a single compound as well as one or
more of the same or different compounds, reference to "optionally a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier" refers to a single optional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as well as

    one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and the like.
             As used in the specification and the appended claims, unless specified to the contrary,
    the following terms have the meaning indicated:

    fusion junctions are at adjacent ring atoms. The fusion junctions may be at nitrogen (e.g.,
    indolizine) or carbon atoms in the 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl.
            The term "hydrogen" (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a
 5  hydrogen radical, and may be depicted as -H.
            The term "hydroxy" (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -OH.
            The term "carboxy" (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -C(O)-OH.
            The term "amino" (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -NH 2 .
            The term "halogen" or "halo" (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a
 0  fluorine radical (which may be depicted as -F), chlorine radical (which may be depicted as
    Cl), bromine radical (which may be depicted as -Br), or iodine radical (which may be
    depicted as -I). The prefix "halo" indicates that the substituent to which the prefix is attached
    is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals. For example,
    haloalkyl means an alkyl substituent in which at least one hydrogen radical is replaced with a
 5  halogen radical. Examples of haloalkyls include chloromethyl, 1-bromoethyl, fluoromethyl,
    difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and 1,1,1 -trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a
    substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical, those halogen radicals may be
    identical or different (unless otherwise stated). Examples of haloalkyl include CI-C   3
    haloalkyls, which is a halogenated alkyl containing from 1 to 3 carbons.
 10         If a moiety is described as "substituted", a non-hydrogen radical is in the place of
    hydrogen radical of any substitutable atom of the moiety. Thus, for example, a substituted
    heteroaryl moiety is a heteroaryl moiety in which at least one non-hydrogen radical is in the
    place of a hydrogen radical on the heterocyclic ring. It should be recognized that if there are
    more than one substitution on a moiety, each non-hydrogen radical may be identical or
25  different (unless otherwise stated).
            If a moiety is described as being "optionally substituted," the moiety may be either (1)
    not substituted or (2) substituted. If a moiety is described as being optionally substituted with
    up to a particular number of non-hydrogen radicals, that moiety may be either (1) not
    substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen radicals or by
30  up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the moiety, whichever is less. Thus,
    for example, if a moiety is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non
    hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be
    optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has
    substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position)

    would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical. To illustrate further, if
    an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen
    radicals, then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non
    hydrogen radicals, whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up
 5  to only 1 non-hydrogen radical.

    abrogating a disease and/or its attendant symptoms.
            The terms "prevent", "preventing", and "prevention" refer to a method of preventing
    the onset of a disease and/or its attendant symptoms or barring a subject from acquiring a
 0  disease. As used herein, "prevent", "preventing" and "prevention" also include delaying the
    onset of a disease and/or its attendant symptoms and reducing a subject's risk of acquiring a
    disease.
            The phrase "therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of a compound, or a
    pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, sufficient to prevent the development of or to
 5  alleviate to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the condition or disorder being
    treated when administered alone or in conjunction with another pharmaceutical agent or
    treatment in a particular subject or subject population. For example in a human or other
    mammal, a therapeutically effective amount can be determined experimentally in a laboratory
    or clinical setting, or may be the amount required by the guidelines of the United States Food
 '0 and Drug Administration, or equivalent foreign agency, for the particular disease and subject
    being treated.
            The term "subject" is defined herein to refer to animals such as mammals, including,
    but not limited to, primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, rats,
    mice and the like. In preferred embodiments, the subject is a human.

            Compounds of this invention may contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms in
    the R or S configuration, in which the terms "R" and "S" are as defined by the IUPAC 1974
    Recommendations for Section E, Fundamental Stereochemistry, Pure Appl. Chem. (1976) 45,
    13-10. Compounds having asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms with equal amounts of R
 5  and S configurations are racemic at those carbon atoms. Atoms with an excess of one
    configuration over the other are assigned the configuration present in the higher amount,
    preferably an excess of about 85%-90%, more preferably an excess of about 95%-99%, and
    still more preferably an excess greater than about 99%. Accordingly, this invention includes
    racemic mixtures, relative and absolute stereoisomers, and mixtures of relative and absolute
 0  stereoisomers.
            Compounds of formula (I) may contain one or more asymmetrically substituted atoms.
    Compounds of formula I may also exist as individual stereoisomers (including enantiomers
    and diastereomers) and mixtures thereof. Individual stereoisomers of compounds of formula
    I may be prepared synthetically from commercially available starting materials that contain
 5  asymmetric or chiral centers or by preparation of racemic mixtures followed by resolution of
    the individual stereoisomer using methods that are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
    Examples of resolution are, for example, (i) attachment of a mixture of enantiomers to a
    chiral auxiliary, separation of the resulting mixture of diastereomers by recrystallization or
    chromatography, followed by liberation of the optically pure product; or (ii) separation of the
 '0 mixture of enantiomers or diastereomers on chiral chromatographic columns.
            Compounds of formula I may also include the various geometric isomers and
    mixtures thereof resulting from the disposition of substituents around a carbon-carbon double
    bond, a carbon-nitrogen double bond, a cycloalkyl group, or a heterocycloalkyl group.
    Substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond or a carbon-nitrogen double bond are
25  designated as being of Z or E configuration and substituents around a cycloalkyl or
    heterocycloalkyl are designated as being of cis or trans configuration.
            Within the present invention it is to be understood that compounds disclosed herein
    may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism and all tautomeric isomers are included in the
    scope of the invention.
30          Thus, the formula drawings within this specification can represent only one of the
    possible tautomeric, geometric, or stereoisomeric forms. It is to be understood that the
    invention encompasses any tautomeric, geometric, or stereoisomeric form, and mixtures
    thereof, and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric, geometric, or stereoisomeric
    form utilized within the formula drawings.

    Isotope Enrichedor Labeled Compounds
            Compounds of the invention can exist in isotope-labeled or -enriched form containing
    one or more atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or
    mass number most abundantly found in nature. Isotopes can be radioactive or non
 5  radioactive isotopes. Isotopes of atoms such as hydrogen, carbon, phosphorous, sulfur,
    fluorine, chlorine, and iodine include, but are not limited to, 2 H, 'H, "C, 1C, 1N,  180, 3P, 5s,
    18F, 36C1, and  125.   Compounds that contain other isotopes of these and/or other atoms are
    within the scope of this invention.
            In another embodiment, the isotope-labeled compounds contain deuterium (2H),
 0  tritium ( 3H) or  14
                         C isotopes. Isotope-labeled compounds of this invention can be prepared by
    the general methods well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. Such isotope
    labeled compounds can be conveniently prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in
    the Examples disclosed herein and Schemes by substituting a readily available isotope
    labeled reagent for a non-labeled reagent. In some instances, compounds may be treated with
 5  isotope-labeled reagents to exchange a normal atom with its isotope, for example, hydrogen
    for deuterium can be exchanged by the action of a deuteric acid such as D 2 SO 4 /D 2 0. In
    addition to the above, relevant procedures and intermediates are disclosed, for instance, in

25          The isotope-labeled compounds of the invention may be used as standards to
    determine the effectiveness of BET bromodomain inhibitors in binding assays. Isotope
    containing compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the in vivo
    metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and metabolic
    pathway of the nonisotope-labeled parent compound (Blake et al. J. Pharm. Sci. 64, 3, 367
30  391 (1975)). Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe, effective therapeutic
    drugs, either because the in vivo active compound administered to the patient or because the
    metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be toxic or carcinogenic (Foster et
    al., Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14, pp. 2-36, Academic press, London, 1985; Kato et al.,

    J. Labelled Comp. Radiopharmaceut., 36(10):927-932 (1995); Kushner et al., Can. J. Physiol.
    Pharmacol.,77, 79-88 (1999).
            In addition, non-radio active isotope containing drugs, such as deuterated drugs called
    "heavy drugs," can be used for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to BET
 5  bromodomain activity. Increasing the amount of an isotope present in a compound above its
    natural abundance is called enrichment. Examples of the amount of enrichment include from
    about 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 42, 46, 50, 54, 58, 63, 67, 71,
    75, 79, 84, 88, 92, 96, to about 100 mol %. Replacement of up to about 15% of normal atom
    with a heavy isotope has been effected and maintained for a period of days to weeks in
 0  mammals, including rodents and dogs, with minimal observed adverse effects (Czajka D M
    and Finkel A J, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1960 84: 770; Thomson J F, Ann. New York Acad. Sci
    1960 84: 736; Czakja D M et al., Am. J. Physiol. 1961 201: 357). Acute replacement of as
    high as 15%-23% in human fluids with deuterium was found not to cause toxicity (Blagojevic
    N et al. in "Dosimetry & Treatment Planning for Neutron Capture Therapy", Zamenhof R,
 5  Solares G and Harling 0 Eds. 1994. Advanced Medical Publishing, Madison Wis. pp.125
    134; Diabetes Metab. 23: 251 (1997)).
             Stable isotope labeling of a drug can alter its physico-chemical properties such as pKa
    and lipid solubility. These effects and alterations can affect the pharmacodynamic response
    of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitution affects a region involved in a ligand-receptor
 '0 interaction. While some of the physical properties of a stable isotope-labeled molecule are
    different from those of the unlabeled one, the chemical and biological properties are the same,
    with one important exception: because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope, any bond
    involving the heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond between
    the light isotope and that atom. Accordingly, the incorporation of an isotope at a site of
25  metabolism or enzymatic transformation will slow said reactions potentially altering the
    pharmacokinetic profile or efficacy relative to the non-isotopic compound.

    Chem. 1999, 576:147-148). For example, the coupling reaction may be conducted in the
    presence of a palladium catalyst and a base, and optionally in the presence of a ligand, and in
    a suitable solvent at elevated temperature (about 80 0C to about 150 0C). The reaction may be

            It can be appreciated that the synthetic schemes and specific examples as illustrated in
   the synthetic examples section are illustrative and are not to be read as limiting the scope of
   the invention as it is defined in the appended claims. All alternatives, modifications, and
 5 equivalents of the synthetic methods and specific examples are included within the scope of
   the claims.
            Optimum reaction conditions and reaction times for each individual step can vary
   depending on the particular reactants employed and substituents present in the reactants used.
   Unless otherwise specified, solvents, temperatures and other reaction conditions can be
 0 readily selected by one of ordinary skill in the art. Specific procedures are provided in the
   Examples section. Reactions can be worked up in the conventional manner, e.g. by
   eliminating the solvent from the residue and further purified according to methodologies
   generally known in the art such as, but not limited to, crystallization, distillation, extraction,
   trituration and chromatography. Unless otherwise described, the starting materials and
 5 reagents are either commercially available or typically can be prepared from commercially
   available materials.
            Routine experimentations, including appropriate manipulation of the reaction
   conditions, reagents and sequence of the synthetic route, protection of any chemical
   functionality that can not be compatible with the reaction conditions, and deprotection at a
20 suitable point in the reaction sequence of the method are included in the scope of the
   invention. Suitable protecting groups and the methods for protecting and deprotecting
   different substituents using such suitable protecting groups are well known to those skilled in
   the art; examples of which can be found in T. Greene and P. Wuts, Protecting Groups in
   Organic Synthesis (3 rd ed.), John Wiley & Sons, NY (1999), which is incorporated herein by
25 reference in its entirety. Synthesis of the compounds of the invention can be accomplished
                                                     d1

    by methods analogous to those described in the synthetic schemes described hereinabove and
    in specific examples.
             Starting materials, if not commercially available, can be prepared by procedures
    selected from standard organic chemical techniques, techniques that are analogous to the
 5  synthesis of known, structurally similar compounds, or techniques that are analogous to the
    above described schemes or the procedures described in the synthetic examples section.
             When an optically active form of a compound is required, it typically can be obtained
    by carrying out one of the procedures described herein using an optically active starting
    material (prepared, for example, by asymmetric induction of a suitable reaction step), or by
 0  resolution of a mixture of the stereoisomers of the compound or intermediates using a
    standard procedure (such as chromatographic separation, precipitation, crystallization, or
    enzymatic resolution).
             Similarly, when a pure geometric isomer of a compound is required, it typically can
    be prepared by carrying out one of the above procedures using a pure geometric isomer as a
 5  starting material, or by resolution of a mixture of the geometric isomers of the compound or
    intermediates using a standard procedure such as chromatographic separation.
             Compounds of formula I can be used in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts.
    The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means those salts which are, within the scope
    of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower
 '0 animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like and are
    commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
             Pharmaceutically acceptable salts have been described in S. M. Berge et al. J.
    Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1977, 66: 1-19.
             Compounds of formula (I) may contain either a basic or an acidic functionality, or
25  both, and can be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, when desired, by using a
    suitable acid or base. The salts may be prepared in situ during the final isolation and
    purification of the compounds of the invention.
             Examples of acid addition salts include, but are not limited to acetate, adipate,
    alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate,
30  camphorsulfonate, digluconate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate,
    fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethansulfonate (isothionate),
    lactate, malate, maleate, methanesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate,
    palmitoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate,
    tartrate, thiocyanate, phosphate, glutamate, bicarbonate, p-toluenesulfonate and undecanoate.

    Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups can be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl
    halides such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and
    iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides
    such as, but not limited to, decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides;
 5  arylalkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others. Water or oil-soluble or
    dispersible products are thereby obtained. Examples of acids which may be employed to
    form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include such inorganic acids as
    hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid and such organic
    acids as acetic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, 4-methylbenzenesulfonic acid, succinic acid
 0  and citric acid.
             Basic addition salts may be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification
    of compounds of this invention by reacting a carboxylic acid-containing moiety with a
    suitable base such as, but not limited to, the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a
    pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation or with ammonia or an organic primary, secondary
 5  or tertiary amine. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, cations
    based on alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such as, but not limited to, lithium, sodium,
    potassium, calcium, magnesium and aluminum salts and the like and nontoxic quaternary
    ammonia and amine cations including ammonium, tetramethylammonium,
    tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine,
 ,0 diethylamine, ethylamine and the like. Other examples of organic amines useful for the
    formation of base addition salts include ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine,
    piperidine, piperazine and the like.
             The term "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug" or "prodrug"as used herein,
    represents those prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the
25  scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and
    lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like,
    commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use.
             Compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms,
    including hydrated forms, such as hemi-hydrates. In general, the solvated forms, with
30  pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water and ethanol among others are equivalent
    to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the invention.
    Pharmaceutical Compositions
             This invention also provides for pharmaceutical compositions comprising a
    therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically
                                                    z12

    acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or
    excipient therefor. The phrase "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a composition suitable
    for administration in medical or veterinary use.
            The pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a compound of formula (I), alone or
 5  or in combination with a second active pharmaceutical agent, may be administered to the
    subjects orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally,
    topically (as by powders, ointments or drops), bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term
    "parenterally" as used herein, refers to modes of administration which include intravenous,
    intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and
 0  infusion.
            The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" as used herein, means a non-toxic,
    inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary
    of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable
    carriers are sugars such as, but not limited to, lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as,
 5  but not limited to, corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as, but not
    limited to, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered
    tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as, but not limited to, cocoa butter and
    suppository waxes; oils such as, but not limited to, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil,
    sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as,
 ,0 but not limited to, ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as, but not
    limited to, magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water;
    isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as
    other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as, but not limited to, sodium lauryl sulfate and
    magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening,
25  flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the
    composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.
            Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically
    acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as
    well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just
30  prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or
    vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene
    glycol and the like), vegetable oils (such as olive oil), injectable organic esters (such as ethyl
    oleate) and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the
                                                       lidI

    use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in
    the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.
            These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents,
    emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be
 5  ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben,
    chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic
    agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable
    pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents, which delay absorption
    such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
 0          In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to slow the
    absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be
    accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with
    poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of
    dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively,
 5  delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug form may be accomplished by
    dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.
            Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in
    biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug
    to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be
 '0 controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and
    poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in
    liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.
            The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a
    bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid
25  compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable
    medium just prior to use.
            Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders
    and granules. In certain embodiments, solid dosage forms may contain from 1% to 95%
    (w/w) of a compound of formula I. In certain embodiments, the compound of formula I may
30  be present in the solid dosage form in a range of from 5% to 70% (w/w). In such solid
    dosage forms, the active compound may be mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically
    acceptable excipient or carrier, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers
    or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol and silicic acid; b) binders
    such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia;

    c) humectants such as glycerol; d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate,
    potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates and sodium carbonate; e) solution
    retarding agents such as paraffin; f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium
    compounds; g) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents
 5  such as kaolin and bentonite clay and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium
    stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate and mixtures thereof. In the case
    of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.
            The pharmaceutical composition may be a unit dosage form. In such form the
    preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active
 0  component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing
    discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or
    ampules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it
    can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. The quantity of active
    component in a unit dose preparation may be varied or adjusted from 0.1 mg to 1000 mg,
 5  from 1 mg to 100 mg, or from 1% to 95% (w/w) of a unit dose, according to the particular
    application and the potency of the active component. The composition can, if desired, also
    contain other compatible therapeutic agents.
            The dose to be administered to a subject may be determined by the efficacy of the
    particular compound employed and the condition of the subject, as well as the body weight or
 '0 surface area of the subject to be treated. The size of the dose also will be determined by the
    existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration of
    a particular compound in a particular subject. In determining the effective amount of the
    compound to be administered in the treatment or prophylaxis of the disorder being treated,
    the physician can evaluate factors such as the circulating plasma levels of the compound,
25  compound toxicities, and/or the progression of the disease, etc. In general, the dose
    equivalent of a compound is from about 1 gg/kg to 100 mg/kg for a typical subject.
            For administration, compounds of the formula I can be administered at a rate
    determined by factors that can include, but are not limited to, the LD 50 of the compound, the
    pharmacokinetic profile of the compound, contraindicated drugs, and the side-effects of the
30  compound at various concentrations, as applied to the mass and overall health of the subject.
    Administration can be accomplished via single or divided doses.
            The compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of the invention can be
    administered at the initial dosage of about 0.001 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg daily. In certain
    embodiments, the daily dose range is from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg. The dosages,
                                                     d ri

    however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the subject, the severity of the
    condition being treated, and the compound being employed. Determination of the proper
    dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Treatment may be
    initiated with smaller dosages, which are less than the optimum dose of the compound.
 5  Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under
    circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and
    administered in portions during the day, if desired.
             Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard
    filled gelatin capsules using such carriers as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular
 0  weight polyethylene glycols and the like.
             The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills and granules can be
    prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well-known in
    the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and may
    also be of a composition such that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially,
 5  in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of
    embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.
             The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with
    one or more of the above-mentioned carriers.
             Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable
 '0 emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds,
    the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for
    example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol,
    isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene
    glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut,
25  corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene
    glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan and mixtures thereof.
             Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions may also include adjuvants such as
    wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming
    agents.
30           Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as,
    for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters,
    microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, tragacanth and
    mixtures thereof.
                                                       d17

            Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which
    can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating
    carriers or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are
    solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or
 5  vaginal cavity and release the active compound.
            Compounds of formula I may also be administered in the form of liposomes.
    Liposomes generally may be derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances.
    Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals which are
    dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and
 0  metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present compositions in
    liposome form may contain, in addition to a compound of formula (I), stabilizers,
    preservatives, excipients and the like. Examples of lipids include, but are not limited to,
    natural and synthetic phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), used separately or
    together.
 5          Methods to form liposomes have been described, see example, Prescott, Ed., Methods
    in Cell Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1976), p. 33 et seq.
            Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound described herein include
    powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile
    conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives, buffers
 '0 or propellants which may be required. Opthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders and
    solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.
    Methods of Use
            The compounds of formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and
    pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically
25  acceptable salt thereof, can be administered to a subject suffering from a bromodomain
    mediated disorder or condition. The term "administering" refers to the method of contacting
    a compound with a subject. Thus, the compounds of formula I can be administered by
    injection, that is, intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously, subcutaneously,
    intraduodenally, parentally, or intraperitoneally. Also, the compounds described herein can
30  be administered by inhalation, for example, intranasally. Additionally, the compounds of
    formula I can be administered transdermally, topically, via implantation, transdermally,
    topically, and via implantation. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the formula I may
    be delivered orally. The compounds can also be delivered rectally, bucally, intravaginally,
    ocularly, andially, or by insufflation. Bromodomain-mediated disorders and conditions can
                                                    ziq

    be treated prophylactically, acutely, and chronically using compounds of formula I,
    depending on the nature of the disorder or condition. Typically, the host or subject in each of
    these methods is human, although other mammals can also benefit from the administration of
    a compound of formula I.
 5          A "bromodomain-mediated disorder or condition" is characterized by the
    participation of one or more bromodomains (e.g., BRD4) in the inception, manifestation of
    one or more symptoms or disease markers, severity, or progression of a disorder or condition.

    Wegener's granulomatosis.
             Compounds of formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be used to
    treat AIDS. In addition, compounds of formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts
    thereof, may be used to treat obesity. Compounds of formula I, or pharmaceutically
 5  acceptable salts thereof, may be used to treat type II diabetes.
             The compounds of formula I can be co-administered to a subject. The term "co
    administered" means the administration of two or more different pharmaceutical agents or
    treatments (e.g., radiation treatment) that are administered to a subject by combination in the
    same pharmaceutical composition or separate pharmaceutical compositions. Thus co
 '0 administration involves administration at the same time of a single pharmaceutical
    composition comprising two or more pharmaceutical agents or administration of two or more
    different compositions to the same subject at the same or different times.
             The compounds of the invention can be co-administered with a therapeutically
    effective amount of one or more agents to treat a cancer, where examples of the agents
25  include, such as radiation, alkylating agents, angiogenesis inhibitors, antibodies,
    antimetabolites, antimitotics, antiproliferatives, antivirals, aurora kinase inhibitors, apoptosis
    promoters (for example, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w and Bfl-1) inhibitors, activators of death receptor
    pathway, Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors, BiTE (Bi-Specific T cell Engager) antibodies, antibody
    drug conjugates, biologic response modifiers, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, cell cycle
30  inhibitors, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, DVDs (dual variable domain antibodies), leukemia
    viral oncogene homolog (ErbB2) receptor inhibitors, growth factor inhibitors, heat shock
    protein (HSP)-90 inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, hormonal therapies,
    immunologicals, inhibitors of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), intercalating antibiotics,
    kinase inhibitors, kinesin inhibitors, Jak2 inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin
                                                     ro

    inhibitors, microRNA's, mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitors,
    multivalent binding proteins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), poly ADP
    (adenosine diphosphate)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, platinum chemotherapeutics,
    polo-like kinase (Plk) inhibitors, phosphoinositide-3 kinase (bromodomain) inhibitors,
 5  proteosome inhibitors, purine analogs, pyrimidine analogs, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
    etinoids/deltoids plant alkaloids, small inhibitory ribonucleic acids (siRNAs), topoisomerase
    inhibitors, ubiquitin ligase inhibitors, and the like, and in combination with one or more of
    these agents.
             BiTE antibodies are bi-specific antibodies that direct T-cells to attack cancer cells by
 0  simultaneously binding the two cells. The T-cell then attacks the target cancer cell.
    Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab (Micromet MT201), blinatumomab
    (Micromet MT103) and the like. Without being limited by theory, one of the mechanisms by
    which T-cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule
    components, which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard, Bcl-2 has been shown
 5  to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest
    that inhibition of Bcl-2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T-cells when targeted
    to cancer cells (V.R. Sutton, D.L. Vaux and J.A. Trapani, J. ofImmunology 1997, 158 (12),
    5783).
             SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified
 '0 nucleotides. The modifications do not abolish cellular activity, but rather impart increased
    stability and/or increased cellular potency. Examples of chemical modifications include
    phosphorothioate groups, 2'-deoxynucleotide, 2'-OCH 3-containing ribonucleotides, 2'-F
    ribonucleotides, 2'-methoxyethyl ribonucleotides, combinations thereof and the like. The
    siRNA can have varying lengths (e.g., 10-200 bps) and structures (e.g., hairpins,
25  single/double strands, bulges, nicks/gaps, mismatches) and are processed in cells to provide
    active gene silencing. A double-stranded siRNA (dsRNA) can have the same number of
    nucleotides on each strand (blunt ends) or asymmetric ends (overhangs). The overhang of 1-2
    nucleotides can be present on the sense and/or the antisense strand, as well as present on the
    5'- and/ or the 3'-ends of a given strand.
30           Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen
    binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen
    binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term "multispecific
    binding protein" means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated
    targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding
                                                     ri

    proteins binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be
    monospecific (i.e., capable of binding one antigen) or multispecific (i.e., capable of binding
    two or more antigens). DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD
    polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig's. Each half of
 5  a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, a light chain DVD polypeptide, and
    two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a
    light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen
    binding site. Multispecific DVDs include DVD binding proteins that bind DLL4 and VEGF,
    or C-met and EFGR or ErbB3 and EGFR.

30          Assay
            Compound dilution series were prepared in DMSO via a 3-fold serial dilution from
    2.5 mM to 42 nM. Compounds were then diluted 6:100 in assay buffer (20 mM Sodium
    Phosphate, pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.010%Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT) to yield

    3X working solutions. Six microliters (tL) of the working solution was then transferred to
    white, low-volume assay plates (Costar #3673). A 1.5X assay mixture containing His-tagged
    bromodomain, Europium-conjugated anti-His antibody (Invitrogen PV5596) and the Alexa
    647-conjugated probe molecule was also prepared. Twelve tL of this solution were added to
 5  the assay plate to reach a final volume of 18 tL. The final concentration of IX assay buffer
    contains 2% DMSO, 50 tM - 0.85 nM compound, 8 nM bromodomain, 1 nM antibody and
    100 or 30 nM probe (for BDI or BDII, respectively). After a one-hour incubation at room
    temperature, TR-FRET ratios were determined using an Envision multilabel plate reader (Ex
    340, Em 495/520).
 0          TR-FRET data were normalized to the means of 24 no-compound controls ("high")
    and 8 controls containing 1 gM un-labeled probe ("low"). Percent inhibition was plotted as a
    function of compound concentration and the data were fit with the 4 parameter logistic
    equation to obtain IC 50s. Inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated from the IC 5 0s, probe Kd
    and probe concentration. Typical Z' values were between 0.65 and 0.75. The minimum
 5  significant ratio was determined to evaluate assay reproducibility (Eastwood et al., (2006) J
    Biomol Screen, 11: 253-261). The MSR was determined to be 2.03 for BDI and 1.93 for
    BDII, and a moving MSR (last six run MSR overtime) for both BDI and BDII was typically <
    3. The Ki values are reported in Table 1.
    MX-1 cell line proliferation assay
 '0 The impact of compounds of the Examples on cancer cell proliferation was determined using the
    breast cancer cell line MX-1 (ATCC) in a 3-day proliferation assay. MX-1 cells were maintained
    in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 C0 and an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . For compound
    testing, MX-1 cells were plated in 96-well black bottom plates at a density of 5000 cells/well in
    90 gl of culture media and incubated at 370 overnight to allow cell adhesion and spreading.
25  Compound dilution series were prepared in DMSO via a 3-fold serial dilution from 3 mM to 0.1
    pM. The DMSO dilution series were then diluted 1:100 in phosphate buffered saline, and 10 pL
    of the resulted solution were added to the appropriate wells of the MX-1 cell plate. The final
    compound concentrations in the wells were 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001, 0.0003 and
    0.000 1 pM. After the addition of compounds, the cells were incubated for 72 more hours and the
30  amounts of viable cells were determined using the Cell Titer Glo assay kit (Promega) according to
    manufacturer suggested protocol.
            Luminescence readings from the Cell Titer Glo assay were normalized to the DMSO
    treated cells and analyzed using the GraphPad Prism software with sigmoidal curve fitting to

  reproducibility (Eastwood et al., (2006) J Biomol Screen, 11: 253-261). The overall MSR
  was determined to be 2.1 and a moving MSR (last six run MSR overtime) has been <2. The
  EC5 0 values are reported in Table 1 for the indicated compounds.

10        Compounds of the Examples listed in Table 3 were assayed for their ability to inhibit
   LPS (lipopolysaccharide) induced IL-6 production in mice. Severe combined
   immunodeficient female mice (8 per group) received an intraperitoneal challenge of
   lipopolysaccharide (2.5 mg/kg, L2630 E.coli 0111 :B4) one hour after oral administration of
                                                179)

   compounds. Mice were euthanized 2 hours after lipopolysaccharide injection, blood was
   removed by cardiac puncture, and then the serum harvested from the blood samples was
   frozen at -80 'C. On the day of the assay the serum samples were brought to room
   temperature and then diluted 1:20 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 % bovine serum
 5 albumin. Interleukin-6 measurements were performed using a cytokine assay from Meso
   Scale Discovery (Gaithersburg, Maryland) for mouse serum analysis according to the
   manufacturer's protocol and read on a SECTOR Imager 6000 (Meso Scale Discovery,
   Gaithersburg, Maryland) instrument. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism software
   (version 5.0) incorporating Dunnett's one way ANOVA. The IL-6 mean and standard
 0 deviation of the group of vehicle treated animals were compared with the IL-6 mean and
   standard deviation of the group treated with drug. A p value < 0.05 means that there is less

   Xenograft tumor growth inhibition assay
           The effect of example compounds to inhibit growth of human tumor xenografts
   implanted in mice was evaluated. Briefly, cells obtained from culture (MV4-11 and OPM-2)
   or tumor brie (MX-1) were suspended in cell culture medium (MEM, Suspension, no
20 Calcium, no Glutamine, Life Technologies Corporation) containing Matrigel (phenol red free,
   Becton Dickinson Biosciences Discovery Labware) and inoculated subcutaneously
   (approximately 5 million per site) into the right hind flank of SCID-beige (MV4-11 and
   OPM-2) or SCID (MX-1) female mice (Charles Rivers Labs) on study day 0. Administration
