                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Field of the Invention
             [0001]
10           The present invention relates to an indoor unit of an air conditioner.
   Description of Related Art
             [0002]
             In the related art, as a flap which is disposed on a downstream side of an outlet
15 of an air-conditioning main body in an indoor unit of an air conditioner, a flap having a
   composite structure is known, which includes an inner flap component member and an
   outer flap component member which is disposed to overlap an outside of the inner flap
   component member.        For example, Patent Document 1 suggests a flap in which a
   hollow lid port disposed on the inside and a box portion disposed on the outside overlap
20 each other to be joined to each other.      In the flap having the composite structure, when
   cold air is blown from the outlet, even though an inner flap structure member comes into
   contact with the cold air from the outlet and is strongly cooled, heat is not easily
   transmitted to an outer surface of the outer flap component member, and thus,
   condensation can be suppressed.

   Publication No. 2009-63275
                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
             [0004]
 5           However, in the air conditioner of the related art, if the flap is in a closed state
   during stopping of an operation, the outlet is covered by the flap.      However, a step or
   the like of a housing (air-conditioning main body) around the outlet can be viewed from
   the outside.   In addition, particularly, the flap of the composite structure is thick, and
   thus, a boundary between the flap and the housing is conspicuous, and it is difficult to
10 improve an appearance quality.
             [0005]
             Accordingly, the present invention provides an indoor unit of an air conditioner
   capable of suppressing condensation of an outer surface when cold air is blown from an
   outlet while improving aesthetic appearance.
15           [0006]
             According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an indoor
   unit of an air conditioner, including: a laterally long outlet which is provided in an
   air-conditioning main body; and a composite flap which is disposed on a downstream
   side of the outlet in a flow of air so as to open and close the outlet by rotating around an
20 axis extending in a lateral direction and covers the outlet in a closed state and a surface of
   the air-conditioning main body around the outlet, in which the composite flap includes an
   inner flap which has a lateral width corresponding to the outlet and is disposed on the
   outlet side, an outer flap which has a wider lateral width than that of the inner flap and is
   disposed to overlap an outside of the inner flap, and a fin which is provided to protrude
25 inward to regulate the flow of the air from the outlet at a boundary position between the

                                                   3
   inner flap and the outer flap in the lateral direction.
             [0007]
             According to the indoor unit, the indoor unit includes the composite flap which
   covers the outlet and the surface of the air-conditioning main body around the outlet in
 5 the closed state.    Accordingly, the composite flap is disposed in a wider range than that
   of the outlet, and thus, can cover the surface of the air-conditioning main body around the
   outlet.   Accordingly, the shape of the air-conditioning main body around the outlet is
   not viewed from the outside, and it is possible to obtain a beautiful appearance in which
   appearances different from the shape of the outlet and the shape of the air-conditioning
10 main body around the outlet, that is, streaks, boundaries, steps, or the like are not present
   by the surface of the composite flap.
             [0008]
             In addition, in this composite flap, the inner flap having the lateral width
   corresponding to the outlet and the outer flap having a wider lateral width than that of the
15 inner flap are disposed to overlap each other in the inside and the outside.     Accordingly,
   heat is not easily transmitted from the inner surface becoming the outlet side to the
   interior side outer surface at a portion corresponding to the outlet of the composite flap,
   and when cold air is blown from the outlet, it is possible to suppress the outer surface
   from being excessively cooled.
20           [0009]
             In addition, the fin provided to protrude inward is provided at the boundary
   position between the inner flap and the outer flap in the lateral direction.    Accordingly,
   the air which flows to spread in the lateral direction from the outlet can be regulated, the
   amount of air which is blown out from the outlet decreases on the end portion side from
25 the fin in the lateral direction, and thus, a heat exchange amount can decrease.

                                                   4
   Moreover, the flow of the air is regulated by the fin, and thus, when cold air is blown
   from the outlet, it is possible to prevent the cold air from coming into contact with a
   portion at a location in which the inner flap does not exist on the end portion side of the
   composite flap in the lateral direction and a single structure configured of only the outer
 5 flap is formed, and the location is not excessively cooled.
             [0010]
             In addition, in the air conditioner according to a second aspect of the present
   invention, in the first aspect, a tip locking piece which forms an insertion space in
   upstream and downstream directions may be provided on a tip portion on the
10 downstream side of the outer flap, and a tip insertion portion which is inserted into the
   insertion space and is locked to both sides of the tip locking piece in the upstream and
   downstream directions may be provided on a tip portion on the downstream side of the
   inner flap.
             [0011]
15           In this way, the tip insertion portion is locked to both sides of the tip locking
   piece in the upstream and downstream directions, and thus, even if differences in the
   amounts of thermal expansion and contraction of the inner flap and the outer flap are
   generated due to a temperature difference between the inner flap and the outer flap, a
   locked state between the tip insertion portion and the tip locking piece is easily
20 maintained, and thus, it is possible to suppress a relative position between the tip portion
   of the outer flap and the tip portion of the inner flap from being displaced or dislocated.
             [0012]
             Moreover, in the air conditioner according to a third aspect of the present
   invention, in the first or second aspect, the composite flap may further include an arm
25 which is rotatably supported on the air-conditioning main body, and the arm may include

                                                    5
   a rotation connection portion which is rotatably connected to the arm-conditioning main
   body and a fixing portion which fixes a rear end portion becoming an upstream side of
   the outer flap, at both ends of the arm.
             [0013]
 5           In this way, the arm which supports the composite flap on the air-conditioning
   main body includes the rotation connection portion which is rotatably connected to the
   air-conditioning main body and the fixing portion which is fixed to the rear end portion
   of the outer flap.    That is, the arm is not fixed to the rear end portion of the inner flap
   and is fixed to the rear end portion of the outer flap.     Accordingly, even when
10 differences in the amounts of thermal expansion and contraction of the outer flap and the
   inner flap are generated and differences in the amounts of deflection between the outer
   flap and the inner flap are generated, the outer flap is less likely to fall off from the inner
   flap, and thus, it is possible to suppress deformation or damages of the composite flap.
             Particularly, as described above, if the tip insertion portion of the inner flap is
15 locked to both sides of the tip locking piece of the outer flap in the upstream and
   downstream directions, the inner flap can be held to the outer flap at a predetermined
   position, deformation of the composite flap can be reliably suppressed, and it is possible
   to secure an appearance quality.
             [0014]
20           In addition, in the air conditioner according to a fourth aspect of the present
   invention, in the third aspect, in the inner flap, an abutment rib which can abut on the
   fixing portion of the arm from the downstream side may be provided to protrude from a
   rear end portion on an upstream side of the inner flap.
             [0015]
25           In this way, if the abutment ribs which can abut on the fixing portion of the arm

                                                    6
   from the downstream side is provided to protrude from the rear end portion of the inner
   flap, after the arm is fixed to the outer flap, the inner flap is integrated with the outer flap
   and the rear end portion of the inner flap is disposed at a predetermined position with
   respect to the rear end portion of the outer flap, and thus, the abutment ribs abut on the
 5 fixing portion of the arm.
             [0016]
             In addition, for example, in a case where fixing caused by fitting between the
   fixing portion of the arm and the rear end portion of the outer flap in the upstream and
   downstream directions is not sufficient and thus, the position of the fixing portion of the
10 arm deviates toward the downstream side with respect to the outer flap, the fixing portion
   of the arm can be strongly pressed by the abutment ribs of the rear end portion of the
   inner flap.    Accordingly, an insufficient fitting state between the arm and the outer flap
   can be completely removed, and thus, the fixing portion of the arm can be reliably fixed
   to the outer flap.
15           [0017]
             According to the indoor unit of an air conditioner, it is possible to suppress
   condensation of the outer surface when cold air is blown from the outlet while improving
   aesthetic appearance.

10                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
             [0019]
             An air conditioner 100 includes an indoor unit 10 which is provided in a room
   and an outdoor unit (not shown) which is connected to the indoor unit 10 by a pipe and is
   provided outside the room.
15           The indoor unit 10 sucks air, adjusts a temperature or humidity of the air, and
   thereafter, blows out air A to perform air conditioning in a room.
             Hereinafter, the indoor unit 10 according to an embodiment the present
   invention will be described.
             The indoor unit 10 includes an air-conditioning main body 11 and a composite
20 flap 20 which is provided in the air-conditioning main body 11.
             [0020]
             As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the air-conditioning main body 11 is formed in a
   laterally long shape which is long in a lateral direction D1, and a heat exchanger 13, a
   blower fan 14, or the like is disposed inside the air-conditioning main body 11.    In a
25 lower portion of the air-conditioning main body 11, a laterally long outlet 15 for blowing

                                                   8
   the air A from the blower fan 14 into the room is provided to be opened downward,
   diagonally downward, or forward.
             [0021]
             As shown in FIGS. 3 to 5, the composite flap 20 which covers the outlet 15 from
 5 the outside so as to open and close the outlet 15 is disposed on a downstream side of the
   outlet 15.    When the air conditioner 100 is operated, the composite flap 20 is opened
   and adjusts a vertical direction of the air A from the outlet 15, and thus, an inclination
   angle of the composite flap 20 with respect to the air-conditioning main body 11 can be
   adjusted.     When the operation of the air conditioner 100 stops, the composite flap 20 is
10 in a closed state, and thus, can cover the outlet 15 and the surface of the air-conditioning
   main body 11 around the outlet 15 (refer to FIG. 1)
             [0022]
             The composite flap 20 includes an inner flap 21 which configures an inner
   surface of the composite flap 20, an outer flap 22 which configures an outer surface
15 thereof, joint structures 16 and 17 which join the inner flap 21 and the outer flap 22, a fin
   23 which regulates the flow of the air A from the outlet 15, and support structures 18 and
   19 which support the composite flap 20 on the air-conditioning main body 11.
              [0023]
             The inner flap 21 is configured of a molded body formed in an approximately
20 plate shape, is disposed on the inner side becoming the outlet 15 side of the composite
   flap 20, and configures the inner surface of the composite flap 20.     The inner flap 21 has
   a lateral width corresponding to the outlet 15.    The lateral width corresponding to the
   outlet 15 may be approximately the same as the lateral width of the outlet 15.       However,
   the lateral width corresponding to the outlet 15 may have a width (a larger width or a
25 smaller width) slightly different from the lateral width of the outlet 15 as long as effects

                                                   9
   by the fin 23 described later are obtained.
             [0024]
             A length of the inner flap 21 in upstream and downstream directions D3 along
   the flow of the air A is not particularly limited.  However, in the present embodiment, a
 5 tip portion 21 a on the downstream side of the inner flap 21 is disposed on the upstream
   side of a tip portion 22a on the downstream side of the outer flap 22.
             [0025]
             The outer flap 22 is configured of a molded body having a shape (curved shape)
   which slightly protrudes toward the outside.      The outer flap 22 is disposed to overlap
10 the outside of the inner flap 21 and configures an outer surface of the composite flap 20.
             The outer flap 22 includes a plate portion 24 which is curved in the upstream
   and downstream directions D3, a rear end portion 22b which uprightly stands on a rear
   end on the upstream side of the plate portion 24, and a plurality of ribs 25 which
   uprightly stand on a surface of the plate portion 24.    The inner flap 21 is supported by
15 the rear end portion 22b, the plurality of ribs 25, or the like, and a space is provided
   between the inner flap 21 and the plate portion 24.
             [0026]
             The outer flap 22 has a wider lateral width than that of the inner flap 21, and a
   length of the outer flap 22 in the upstream and downstream directions D3 is longer than
20 that of the inner flap 21.   In a state where the composite flap 20 is closed, in both end
   sides of the outlet 15 in the lateral direction D1 and the downstream side of the outlet 15
   in the upstream and downstream directions D3, the outer flap 22 covers the periphery of
   the outlet 15 in the air-conditioning main body 11.      More specifically, a width of the
   outer flap 22 in the lateral direction D1 is approximately the same as a width of the
25 air-conditioning main body 11 in the lateral direction D1, and in the state where the

                                                  10
   composite flap 20 is closed, the position of the tip portion 22a of the outer flap 22 is
   disposed at a position which is approximately the same as that of a front end portion of
   the air-conditioning main body 11.
             [0027]
 5           The inner flap 21 and the outer flap 22 are integrally joined to each other by the
   joint structures 16 and 17 which are provided on a tip side and a rear end side of the
   composite flap 20.
             The joint structure 16 on the tip side of the composite flap 20 includes tip
   locking pieces 26 which are provided on the tip portion 22a on the downstream side of
10 the outer flap 22 and tip insertion portions 27 which are provided on the tip portion 21 a
   on the downstream side of the inner flap 21.
             [0028]
             Each of the tip locking pieces 26 of the outer flap 22 is provided in a band plate
   shape.    Each tip locking piece 26 is disposed to be separated from the plate portion 24 in
15 a plate thickness direction, and thus, an insertion space 28 penetrating in the upstream
   and downstream directions D3 is formed between the tip locking piece 26 and the plate
   portion 24.
             [0029]
             Each of the tip insertion portions 27 of the inner flap 21 is inserted into the
20 insertion space 28 of the outer flap 22 and is configured to be locked to both sides in the
   upstream and downstream directions D3 from the inside of the tip locking piece 26.          In
   the embodiment, locking recessed portions 29 which can be fitted to the tip locking
   pieces 26 are provided in the tip insertion portions 27.
             In a state where each tip insertion portion 27 is inserted into the insertion space
25 28 and is locked to the tip locking piece 26, the tip insertion portion 27 has a shape

                                                  11
   (abutment portion 46) in which a rear surface side (outer side) of the tip insertion portion
   27 abuts on the plate portion 24 of the outer flap 22.    In addition, in the tip insertion
   portion 27, a tip side is further separated from the plate portion 24 than the abutment
   portion 46.
 5           [0030]
             The joint structure 17 on the rear end side of the composite flap 20 includes a
   plurality of rear end recessed portions 31 which are provided on the rear end portion 22b
   of the outer flap 22 and are recessed in a plate thickness direction and a plurality of pairs

10 direction.   In addition, the joint structure 17 includes a plurality of rear end protrusion
   portions 33 which are provided on the rear end portion 21b of the inner flap 21 and
   protrude to the upstream side and a plurality of rear end notch portions 34 which are
   recessed toward the downstream side from the rear end portion 21b.
             [0031]
15           A fixing portion 36 described later of the arm 35 can be disposed between the
   pair of rear end ribs 32 and each of the rear end ribs 32 is provided to extend from the
   rear end portion 22b toward the downstream side.
             [0032]
             Each of the rear end protrusion portions 33 is provided to be fitted to the rear
20 end recessed portion 31 and the rear end notch portion 34 is provided to be fitted to the
   pair of rear end ribs 32.    In addition, abutment ribs 37 described later which can abut on
   the fixing portion 36 of the arm 35 are provided to protrude from a bottom surface of the
   rear end notch portion 34 toward the upstream side.
             [0033]
25           The fin 23 is provided to vertically protrude at a boundary position between the

                                                  12
   inner flap 21 and the outer flap 22 of the composite flap 20 in the lateral direction D1.
   Here, the vertical direction may be a direction along a surface intersecting the lateral
   direction D1 or may be a direction along a surface orthogonal to the lateral direction D1.
   The fin 23 may be integrally formed with any one of the inner flap 21 and the outer flap
 5 22 or may be provided to be separated from the flaps 21 and 22.        In the present
   embodiment, the fin 23 is integrally provided with the inner flap 21.
            The fin 23 is formed in a plate shape, an end surface 23a of the fin 23 facing the
   downstream side becomes a surface which extends in a flat surface shape such that a
   height of the end surface 23a gradually decreases toward the downstream side, and
10 thereafter, has an inclination angle which is steep in the middle and is curved to protrude
   toward the inner flap 21 on the downstream side.       In addition, an end surface 23b of the
   fin 23 facing the upstream side becomes a surface which straightly stands in a flat surface
   shape in a direction intersecting the lateral direction D1 and the upstream and
   downstream directions D3 from the inner flap 21 and thereafter, is curved to be recessed
15 toward the downstream side.
            [0034]
            The support structures 18 and 19 which support the composite flap 20 on the
   air-conditioning main body 11 are provided on the rear end side of the composite flap 20
   and both end sides of the composite flap 20 in the lateral direction D1.
20          The support structure 18 on the rear end side of the composite flap 20 includes
   the arm 35 which rotatably supports the composite flap 20 on the air-conditioning main
   body 11.    The arm 35 includes an arm body 38, a rotation connection portion 39 which
   is provided on one end of the arm body 38 and is rotatably connected to the
   air-conditioning main body 11, and the fixing portion 36 which is provided on the other
25 end of the arm body 38 and is fixed to the rear end portion 22b of the outer flap 22.

                                                     13
             [0035]
             The arm body 38 is formed to be largely curved in a semicircular shape when
   viewed in the lateral direction D1.       The arm body 38 protrudes upward in a state where
   the air conditioner 100 is operated (in a state where the composite flap 20 is open).
 5           [0036]
             The rotation connection portion 39 has a notch hole 39a having an
   approximately C shape which is opened to be fittable to a rotary shaft 12 which is
   provided on the lower portion of the air-conditioning main body 11 and has an axis
   extending in the lateral direction D1 as a center.       The opening of the notch hole 39a of
10 the rotation connection portion 39 faces the lower side in the state where the air
   conditioner 100 is operated (the state where the composite flap 20 is open)
             [0037]
             The fixing portion 36 is provided to be fittable to the rear end portion 22b of the
   outer flap 22.     Specifically, a plurality of fitting protrusion pieces 42 which can be
15 engaged with and fitted to a plurality of protrusion pieces 41 protruding toward the
   downstream side are provided on the rear end portion 22b of the outer flap 22.         More
   specifically, the plurality of protrusion pieces 41 are provided to be arranged at intervals
   in the direction orthogonal to the lateral direction D1 and the upstream and downstream
   directions, and similarly to the protrusion pieces 41, the plurality of fitting protrusion
20 pieces 42 are provided to be arranged at intervals in the direction orthogonal to the lateral
   direction D1 and the upstream and downstream directions D3, and the protrusion pieces
   41 are respectively fitted to the recessed portions 42a which are each formed between the
   plurality of fitting protrusion pieces 42.
             [0038]
25           In addition, the fixing portion 36 has an abutment surface 43 on which the

                                                    14
   abutment ribs 37 provided on the rear end portion 21b of the inner flap 21 can abut it
   from the downstream side.
             [0039]
             Although the support structures 19 on both end sides of the composite flap 20 in
 5 the lateral direction D1 are not shown in detail, the support structures 19 includes links
   44 which are provided to be vertically driven with respect to the air-conditioning main
   body 11 and connection bosses 45 which are provided on both end portions of the inner
   flap 21 in the lateral direction and at the outer flap 22 at positions adjacent to the
   downstream side of the fin 23 and are rotatably connected to links 44 around the axis
10 extending in the lateral direction D1.
             [0040]
             For example, the composite flap 20 may be mounted on the air-conditioning
   main body 11 as follows.       First, the plurality of arms 35 are fixed to the rear end portion
   22b of the outer flap 22.     The plurality of pairs of rear end ribs 32 are provided at the
15 fixed positions of the arms 35 in the rear end portion 22b of the outer flap 22, and the
   fixing portion 36 is disposed to be interposed between the rear end ribs 32 of each pair.
   In addition, the plurality of fitting protrusion pieces 42 provided in the fixing portion 36
   of the arm 35 and the plurality of protrusion pieces 41 provided in the rear end portion
   22b of the outer flap 22 are fitted to each other.
20           [0041]
             Next, the outer flap 22 and the inner flap 21 are integrated with each other by
   the joint structures 16 and 17 on the tip side and the rear end side.
             Specifically, the tip insertion portion 27 of the tip portion 21 a of the inner flap
   21 is inserted into the insertion space 28 of the tip portion 22a of the outer flap 22, and
25 each of the locking recessed portions 29 is locked to the tip locking piece 26.        The inner

                                                  15
   flap 21 is supported by the ribs 25 of the outer flap 22, and thus, the rear end portion 21b
   of the inner flap 21 is disposed at a predetermined position with respect to the rear end
   portion 22b of the outer flap 22.    At this time, the abutment surface 43 of the fixing
   portion 36 of the arm 35 abuts on the abutment ribs 37 of the rear end portion 21b of the
 5 inner flap 21 to be pressed, and thus, the abutment surface 43 is fixed.
             In addition, the rear end recessed portion 31 of the rear end portion 22b of the
   outer flap 22 and the rear end protrusion portion 33 of the rear end portion 21b of the
   inner flap 21 are fitted to each other, and the pair of rear end ribs 32 and the rear end
   notch portion 34 are fitted to each other.    Accordingly, the outer flap 22 and the inner
10 flap 21 are integrated with each other to configure the composite flap 20.
             [0042]
             Thereafter, the rotation connection portion 39 of the arm 35 is fitted to the rotary
   shaft 12 of the air-conditioning main body 11.      In addition, the link 44 which is
   vertically driven is connected to each connection boss 45 provided in the outer flap 22.
15          Accordingly, the composite flap 20 is mounted on the air-conditioning main
   body 11.
             [0043]
            According to the indoor unit 10 of the above-described present embodiment, in
   the closed state where the outlet 15 is closed, the composite flap 20 can cover the surface
20 of the air-conditioning main body 11 in a wider range than the outlet 15.
             [0044]
             In addition, the inner flap 21 does not exist on both end portions in the lateral
   direction D1, and thus, the composite flap 20 is thinned.      Accordingly, a volume inside
   the air-conditioning main body 11 is saved on both end portions in the lateral direction
25 D1, and thus, the conditioning main body 11 can have a shape protruding to the

                                                   16
   composite flap 20 side.     In addition, also in this case, if the composite flap 20 is in a
   closed state, the protrusion shape of the air-conditioning main body 11 is not viewed.
   Accordingly, it is possible to obtain a beautiful appearance in which appearances
   different from the shape of the outlet 15 and the shape of the air-conditioning main body
 5 11 around the outlet 15, that is, streaks, boundaries, steps, or the like are not present by
   the surface of the composite flap 20.
             [0045]
             In this composite flap 20, the inner flap 21 having the lateral width
   corresponding to the outlet 15 and the outer flap 22 having a wider lateral width than that
10 of the inner flap 21 are disposed to overlap each other in the inside and the outside.
   Accordingly, heat is not easily transmitted from the inner surface becoming the outlet 15
   side to the outer surface at the portion corresponding to the outlet 15 of the composite
   flap 20.    Therefore, when cold air is blown from the outlet 15, the outer surface is not
   excessively cooled, and thus, it is possible to suppress condensation or the like from
15 being generated on the outer surface of the composite flap 20.
             [0046]
             In addition, the fin 23 provided to protrude inward is provided at the boundary
   position between the inner flap 21 and the outer flap 22 in the lateral direction D1.
   Accordingly, the air A which flows to spread in the lateral direction D1 from the outlet 15
20 can be regulated, the amount of air A which is blown out from the outlet 15 decreases on
   the end portion side from the fin 23 in the lateral direction D1, and thus, a heat exchange
   amount of the air A at the heat exchanger 13 can decrease.
             [0047]
             In addition, when cold air is blown from the outlet 15, the flow of the cold air is
25 regulated by the fin 23.    Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the cold air from the

                                                  17
   outlet 15 from coming into contact with the portion at the position in which the inner flap
   21 does not exist on the end portion side from the portion of the composite flap
   corresponding to the outlet 15 in the lateral direction D1, that is, the portion at the
   position in which the inner flap does not exist in the composite flap 20 and a single
 5 structure configured of only the outer flap is formed.     Accordingly, it is possible to
   suppress condensation or the like from being generated on the outer surface of the
   composite flap 20.
             [0048]
             In addition, the tip locking piece 26 forming the insertion space 28 in the
10 upstream and downstream directions D3 is provided in the tip portion 22a of the outer
   flap 22, and the tip insertion portion 27 which is inserted into the insertion space 28 and
   is locked to both sides of the tip locking piece 26 in the upstream and downstream
   directions D3 is provided in the tip portion 21a of the inner flap 21.    Accordingly, by
   moving the tip portion 22a of the outer flap 22 and the tip portion 21 a of the inner flap 21
15 relative to each other in the upstream and downstream directions D3, it is possible to
   easily lock the tip insertion portion 27 to the tip locking piece 26.
             [0049]
             Moreover, the tip insertion portion 27 is locked to both sides of the tip locking
   piece 26 in the upstream and downstream directions D3, and thus, even if differences in
20 the amounts of thermal expansion and contraction of the inner flap 21 and the outer flap
   22 are generated due to a temperature difference between the inner flap 21 and the outer
   flap 22, a locked state between the tip insertion portion 27 and the tip locking piece 26 is
   easily maintained, and thus, it is possible to suppress a relative position between the tip
   portion 22a of the outer flap 22 and the tip portion 21 a of the inner flap 21 from being
25 displaced or dislocated.

                                                   18
             [0050]
             In addition, the tip insertion portion 27 inserted into the insertion space 28 abuts
   on the plate portion 24, and thus, even when the composite flap 20 is deformed, it is
   possible to suppress the tip insertion portion 27 from being displaced in a direction
 5 separated from the tip locking piece 26, and the locked state between the tip insertion
   portion 27 and the tip locking piece 26 can be maintained.
             Moreover, in the tip insertion portion 27, the tip side is further separated from
   the plate portion 24 than the abutment portion 46, and thus, the tip side of the tip
   insertion portion 27 is pressed.     Accordingly, the tip insertion portion 27 can be
10 elastically deformed with the abutment portion 46 as a supporting point, and the tip
   insertion portion 27 can be easily locked to and disengaged from the tip locking piece 26.
             [0051]
             In addition, the arm 35 which supports the composite flap 20 on the
   air-conditioning main body 11 includes the rotation connection portion 39 which is
15 rotatably connected to the air-conditioning main body 11 and the fixing portion 36 which
   is fixed to the rear end portion 22b of the outer flap 22.     The arm 35 is not fixed to the
   rear end portion 21b of the inner flap 21 and is fixed to the rear end portion 22b of the
   outer flap 22.    Accordingly, even when differences in the amounts of thermal expansion
   and contraction of the outer flap 22 and the inner flap 21 are generated and the amounts
20 of deflection between the outer flap 22 and the inner flap 21 are different from each other,
   the outer flap 22 is less likely to fall off from the inner flap 21, and thus, it is possible to
   suppress deformation or damages of the composite flap 20.
             [0052]
             Particularly, the tip insertion portion 27 of the inner flap 21 is locked to both
25 sides of the tip locking piece 26 of the outer flap 22 in the upstream and downstream

                                                  19
   directions D3, and thus, the inner flap 21 can be held to the outer flap 22 at a
   predetermined position, deformation of the composite flap 20 can be reliably suppressed,
   and it is possible to secure an appearance quality.
             [0053]
 5           In addition, in the arm 35, the rotation connection portion 39 having the
   approximately C-shaped notch hole 39a is provided in the arm body 38 which is largely
   curved.    Accordingly, the arm 35 fixed to the composite flap 20 is fitted to the rotary
   shaft 12 of the air-conditioning main body 11 from above and is connected to the rotary
   shaft 12, and thus, the composite flap 20 can be supported on the air-conditioning main
10 body 11.    Accordingly, it is possible to easily mount the composite flap 20 on the
   air-conditioning main body 11.
             In addition, a load of the composite flap 20 is applied to the connection portion
   between the air-conditioning main body 11 and the rotary shaft 12 from above, and thus,
   the rotation connection portion 39 of the arm 35 can be stably supported by the rotary
15 shaft 12, and it is difficult for the composite flap 20 to come off from the air-conditioning
   main body 11.
             [0054]
             In addition, the connection boss 45 connected to the link 44 which is provided in
   the air-conditioning main body 11 and is driven to be lifted and lowered is provided in
20 the outer flap 22.    Accordingly, the arm 35 and the link 44 which connect the composite
   flap 20 to the air-conditioning main body 11 are connected to the outer flap 22, and thus,
   the inner flap 21 is not directly connected to the air-conditioning main body 11.
   Accordingly, even when differences in the amounts of thermal expansion and contraction
   between the inner flap 21 and the outer flap 22 are generated, it is possible to prevent the
25 inner flap 21 from falling off from the air-conditioning main body 11.

                                                   20
             [0055]
             In addition, the abutment ribs 37 which can abut on the fixing portion 36 of the
   arm 35 from the downstream side is provided to protruded from the upstream rear end
   portion 21b of the inner flap 21.     Accordingly, after the arm 35 is fixed to the outer flap
 5 22, if the inner flap 21 is integrated with the outer flap 22 and the rear end portion 21b of
   the inner flap 21 is disposed at a predetermined position with respect to the rear end
   portion 22b of the outer flap 22, the abutment ribs 37 abut on the fixing portion 36 of the
   arm 35.
             [0056]
10           In this case, in a case where the fitting between the fitting protrusion pieces 42
   of the arm 35 and the protrusion pieces 41 of the outer flap 22 is not sufficient, the
   position of the fixing portion 36 of the arm 35 may deviate toward the downstream side
   with respect to the outer flap 22.    Even in such a case, if the rear end portion 21b of the
   inner flap 21 is disposed at a predetermined position with respect to the rear end portion
15 22b of the outer flap 22, the fixing portion 36 of the arm 35 can be strongly pressed by
   the abutment ribs 37 of the inner flap 21.
             Accordingly, an insufficient fitting state between the fitting protrusion pieces 42
   of the arm 35 and the protrusion pieces 41 of the outer flap 22 can be completely
   removed, and thus, the fixing portion 36 of the arm 35 can be reliably fixed to the outer
20 flap 22.
             [0057]
             Hereinbefore, the embodiment of the present invention is described in detail.
   However, some design changes can be performed within a range which does not depart
   from the technical idea of the present invention.
25           For example, in the embodiment, in the joint structure 16, the outer flap 22 and

                                                  21
   the inner flap 21 are joined to each other by the tip locking pieces 26 and the locking
   recessed portions 29 provided in the tip portions 21a and 22a of the inner flap 21 and the
   outer flap 22.    However, the present invention is not particularly limited to this, and for
   example, the present invention can be applied by other joint structures such as a fastener
 5 of a screw or the like.    This is similarly applied to the joint structure 17.
             [0058]
             In addition, the shape of the fin 23 is not limited to the above-described case.
   For example, the fin 23 may be formed in a rectangular plate shape.
             In addition, various configurations of the air-conditioning main body 11 are not
10 limited to the above-described case, and the various configurations may be appropriately
   changed.
             While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described and
   illustrated above, it should be understood that these are exemplary of the invention and
   are not to be considered as limiting.     Additions, omissions, substitutions, and other
15 modifications can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present
   invention.    Accordingly, the invention is not to be considered as being limited by the
   foregoing description, and is only limited by the scope of the appended claims.
