                                           Detailed Description
             For purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the disclosure,
reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings, and specific
language will be used to describe the same. It will nonetheless be understood that no
limitation of the scope of the invention is intended by the illustration and description
of certain embodiments of the invention. In addition, any alterations and/or
modifications of the illustrated and/or described embodiment(s) are contemplated as
being within the scope of the present invention. Further, any other applications of the
principles of the invention, as illustrated and/or described herein, as would normally
occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention pertains, are contemplated as being
within the scope of the present invention.
             Referring to the drawings, and in particular FIG. 1, some aspects of a non-limiting
example of a fuel cell system 10 in accordance with an embodiment of the present
invention is schematically depicted. In the embodiment of FIG. 1, various features,
components and interrelationships therebetween of aspects of an embodiment of the
present invention are depicted. However, the present invention is not limited to the
particular embodiment of FIG. 1 and the components, features and interrelationships
therebetween as are illustrated in FIG. 1 and described herein.
             The present embodiment of fuel cell system 10 includes a plurality of
electrochemical cells 12, i.e., individual fuel cells, formed on a substrate 14.
Electrochemical cells 12 are coupled together in series by interconnects 16. Fuel cell
system 10 is a segmented-in-series arrangement deposited on a flat porous ceramic
tube, although it will be understood that the present invention is equally applicable to
segmented-in-series arrangements on other substrates, such on a circular porous
ceramic tube. In various embodiments, fuel cell system 10 may be an integrated planar
fuel cell system or a tubular fuel cell system.
             Each electrochemical cell 12 of the present embodiment has an oxidant side 18
and a fuel side 20. The oxidant is typically air, but could also be pure oxygen (02) or
other oxidants, e.g., including dilute air for fuel cell systems having air recycle loops,
and is supplied to electrochemical cells 12 from oxidant side 18. Substrate 14 of the
                                                   8
9843732 2 (GHMatters) P100924.AU.1

RORO-2420                                                                    KDIM-9843732_2
present embodiment is porous, e.g., a porous ceramic material which is stable at fuel
cell operation conditions and chemically compatible with other fuel cell materials. In
other embodiments, substrate 14 may be a surface-modified material, e.g., a porous
ceramic material having a coating or other surface modification, e.g., configured to
prevent or reduce interaction between electrochemical cell 12 layers and substrate 14.
A fuel, such as a reformed hydrocarbon fuel, e.g., synthesis gas, is supplied to
electrochemical cells 12 from fuel side 20 via channels (not shown) in porous substrate
14. Although air and synthesis gas reformed from a hydrocarbon fuel are employed in
the present embodiment, it will be understood that electrochemical cells using other
oxidants and fuels may be employed without departing from the scope of the present
invention, e.g., pure hydrogen and pure oxygen. In addition, although fuel is supplied to
electrochemical cells 12 via substrate 14 in the present embodiment, it will be
understood that in other embodiments of the present invention, the oxidant may be
supplied to the electrochemical cells via a porous substrate.
             Referring to FIG. 2, some aspects of a non-limiting example of fuel cell system
10 are described in greater detail. Fuel cell system 10 can be formed of a plurality of
layers screen printed onto substrate 14. Screen printing is a process whereby a woven
mesh has openings through which the fuel cell layers are deposited onto substrate 14.
The openings of the screen determine the length and width of the printed layers.
Screen mesh, wire diameter, ink solids loading and ink rheology determine the
thickness of the printed layers. Fuel cell system 10 layers include an anode conductive
layer 22, an anode layer 24, an electrolyte layer 26, a cathode layer 28 and a cathode
conductive layer 30. In one form, electrolyte layer 26 is formed of an electrolyte sub
layer 26A and an electrolyte sub-layer 26B. In other embodiments, electrolyte layer 26
may be formed of any number of sub-layers. It will be understood that FIG. 2 is not to
scale; for example, vertical dimensions are exaggerated for purposes of clarity of
illustration.
             Interconnects for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are preferably electrically
conductive in order to transport electrons from one electrochemical cell to another;
mechanically and chemically stable under both oxidizing and reducing environments
during fuel cell operation; and nonporous, in order to prevent diffusion of the fuel and/or
                                                    9
9843732 2 (GHMatters) P100924.AU.1

RORO-2420                                                                 KDIM-9843732_2
oxidant through the interconnect. If the interconnect is porous, fuel may diffuse to the
oxidant side and burn, resulting in local hot spots that may result in a reduction of fuel
cell life, e.g., due to degradation of materials and mechanical failure, as well as reduced
efficiency of the fuel cell system. Similarly, the oxidant may diffuse to the fuel side,
resulting in burning of the fuel. Severe interconnect leakage may significantly reduce the
fuel utilization and performance of the fuel cell, or cause catastrophic failure of fuel cells
or stacks.
             For segmented-in-series cells, fuel cell components may be formed by depositing
thin films on a porous ceramic substrate, e.g., substrate 14. In one form, the films are
deposited via a screen printing process, including the interconnect. In other
embodiments, other process may be employed to deposit or otherwise form the thin
films onto the substrate. The thickness of interconnect layer may be 5 to 30 microns,
but can also be much thicker, e.g., 100 microns. If the interconnect is not fully
nonporous, e.g., due to sintering porosity, microcracks, voids and other defects
introduced during processing, gas or air flux through interconnect layer may be very
high, resulting in undesirable effects, as mentioned above. Accordingly, in one aspect
of the present invention, the interconnect (interconnect 16) is configured to minimize or
eliminate diffusion of the oxidant and fuel therethrough.
             The material of interconnect 16 of the present embodiment is a precious metal,
such as Ag, Pd, Au and/or Pt and/or alloys thereof, although other materials may be
employed without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, in
other embodiments, it is alternatively contemplated that other materials may be
employed, including precious metal alloys, such as Ag-Pd, Ag-Au, Ag-Pt, Au-Pd, Au-Pt,
Pt-Pd, Ag-Au-Pd, Ag-Au-Pt, Ag-Au-Pd-Pt and/or binary, ternary, quaternary alloys in the
Pt-Pd-Au-Ag family, inclusive of alloys having minor non-precious metal additions,
cermets composed of a precious metal, precious metal alloy, Ni metal and/or Ni alloy
and an inert ceramic phase, such as alumina, or ceramic phase with minimum ionic
conductivity which will not create significant parasitics, such as YSZ (yttria stabilized
zirconia, also known as yttria doped zirconia, yttria doping is 3-8 mol%, preferably 3-5
mol%), ScSZ (scandia stabilized zirconia, scandia doping is 4-10 mol%, preferably 4-6
mol%), and/or conductive ceramics, such as conductive perovskites with A or B-site

and other doped lanthanum chromites. In some embodiments, it is contemplated that
all or part of interconnect 16 may be formed of a Ni metal cermet and/or a Ni alloy
cermet in addition to or in place of the materials mentioned above. The Ni metal cermet
and/or the Ni alloy cermet may have one or more ceramic phases, for example and
without limitation, a ceramic phase being YSZ (yttria doping is 3-8 mol%, preferably 3-5
mol%), alumina, ScSZ (scandia doping is 4-10 mol%, preferably 4-6 mol%), doped ceria
and/or TiO 2.
             One example of materials for interconnect 16 is y(PdxPt 1.x)-(1-y)YSZ. Where x is
from 0 to 1 in weight ratio, preferably x is in the range of 0 to 0.5 for lower hydrogen flux.
Y is from 0.35 to 0.80 in volume ratio, preferably y is in the range of 0.4 to 0.6.
             Anode conductive layer 22 of the present embodiment is an electrode conductive
layer formed of a nickel cermet, such as such as Ni-YSZ (yttria doping in zirconia is 3-8
mol%,), Ni-ScSZ (scandia doping is 4-10 mol%, preferably second doping for phase
stability for 10 mol% scandia-ZrO 2) and/or Ni-doped ceria (such as Gd or Sm doping),
doped lanthanum chromite (such as Ca doping on A site and Zn doping on B site),
doped strontium titanate (such as La doping on A site and Mn doping on B site) and/or
La1 .xSrxMnyCr1 .yO3. Alternatively, it is considered that other materials for anode
conductive layer 22 may be employed such as cermets based in part or whole on
precious metal. Precious metals in the cermet may include, for example, Pt, Pd, Au,
Ag, and/or alloys thereof. The ceramic phase may include, for example, an inactive
non-electrically conductive phase, including, for example, YSZ, ScSZ and/or one or
more other inactive phases, e.g., having desired coefficients of thermal expansion
(CTE) in order to control the CTE of the layer to match the CTE of the substrate and

             One example of anode conductive layer material is 76.5%Pd, 8.5%Ni, 15%3YSZ.

proton and/or oxygen ion conducting ceramic, may be employed. In one form,
electrolyte layer 26 is formed of YSZ, such as 3YSZ and/or 8YSZ. In other
embodiments, electrolyte layer 26 may be formed of ScSZ, such as 4ScSZ, 6ScSz
and/or 10ScSZ in addition to or in place of YSZ. In other embodiments, other materials
may be employed. For example, it is alternatively considered that electrolyte layer 26
may be made of doped ceria and/or doped lanthanum gallate. In any event, electrolyte
layer 26 is essentially impervious to diffusion therethrough of the fluids used by fuel cell
10, e.g., synthesis gas or pure hydrogen as fuel, as well as, e.g., air or 02 as an
oxidant, but allows diffusion of oxygen ions or protons.

precious metal cermet, although other materials may be employed without departing
from the scope of the present invention. The precious metals in the precious metal
cermet may include, for example, Pt, Pd, Au, Ag and/or alloys thereof. The ceramic
phase may include, for example, YSZ, ScSZ and A12 0 3 , or other ceramic materials.
             One example of cathode conductive layer materials is 80wt%Pd-20wt%LSM.
             In the embodiment of FIG. 2, various features, components and interrelationships
therebetween of aspects of an embodiment of the present invention are depicted.
However, the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiment of FIG. 2 and
the components, features and interrelationships therebetween as are illustrated in FIG.

             In the present embodiment, anode conductive layer 22 is printed directly onto
substrate 14, as is a portion of electrolyte sub-layer 26A. Anode layer 24 is printed onto
anode conductive layer 22. Portions of electrolyte layer 26 are printed onto anode layer

onto substrate 14. Cathode layer 28 is printed on top of electrolyte layer 26. Portions of
cathode conductive layer 30 are printed onto cathode layer 28 and onto electrolyte layer
26. Cathode layer 28 is spaced apart from anode layer 24 in a direction 32 by the local
thickness of electrolyte layer 26.
             Anode layer 24 includes anode gaps 34, which extend in a direction 36.
Cathode layer 28 includes cathode gaps 38, which also extend in direction 36. In the
present embodiment, direction 36 is substantially perpendicular to direction 32, although
the present invention is not so limited. Gaps 34 separate anode layer 24 into a plurality
of individual anodes 40, one for each electrochemical cell 12. Gaps 38 separate
cathode layer 28 into a corresponding plurality of cathodes 42. Each anode 40 and the
corresponding cathode 42 that is spaced apart in direction 32 therefrom, in conjunction

with the portion of electrolyte layer 26 disposed therebetween, form an electrochemical
cell 12.
             Similarly, anode conductive layer 22 and cathode conductive layer 30 have
respective gaps 44 and 46 separating anode conductive layer 22 and cathode
conductive layer 30 into a plurality of respective anode conductor films 48 and cathode
conductor films 50. The terms, "anode conductive layer" and "anode conductor film"
may be used interchangeably, in as much as the latter is formed from one or more
layers of the former; and the terms, "cathode conductive layer" and "cathode conductor
film" may be used interchangeably, in as much as the latter is formed from one or more
layers of the former.
             In the present embodiment, anode conductive layer 22 has a thickness, i.e., as
measured in direction 32, of approximately 5-15 microns, although other values may be
employed without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, it is
considered that in other embodiments, the anode conductive layer may have a
thickness in the range of 5-50 microns. In yet other embodiments, different thicknesses
may be used, depending upon the particular material and application.
               Similarly, anode layer 24 has a thickness, i.e., as measured in direction 32, of
approximately 5-20 microns, although other values may be employed without departing
from the scope of the present invention. For example, it is considered that in other
embodiments, the anode layer may have a thickness in the range of 5-40 microns. In
yet other embodiments, different thicknesses may be used, depending upon the
particular anode material and application.
             Electrolyte layer 26, including both electrolyte sub-layer 26A and electrolyte sub

             Cathode layer 28 has a thickness, i.e., as measured in direction 32, of
approximately 10-20 microns, although other values may be employed without
departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, it is considered that in
other embodiments, the cathode layer may have a thickness in the range of 10-50
microns. In yet other embodiments, different thicknesses may be used, depending
upon the particular cathode material and application.
             Cathode conductive layer 30 has a thickness, i.e., as measured in direction 32, of
approximately 5-100 microns, although other values may be employed without
departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, it is considered that in
other embodiments, the cathode conductive layer may have a thickness less than or
greater than the range of 5-100 microns. In yet other embodiments, different
thicknesses may be used, depending upon the particular cathode conductive layer
material and application.
             In each electrochemical cell 12, anode conductive layer 22 conducts free
electrons away from anode 24 and conducts the electrons to cathode conductive layer
30 via interconnect 16. Cathode conductive layer 30 conducts the electrons to cathode
28.
             Interconnect 16 is embedded in electrolyte layer 26, and is electrically coupled to
anode conductive layer 22, and extends in direction 32 from anode conductive layer 22
through electrolyte sub-layer 26A toward electrolyte sub-layer 26B, then in direction 36
from one electrochemical cell 12 to the next adjacent electrochemical cell 12, and then
in direction 32 again toward cathode conductive layer 30, to which interconnect 16 is
electrically coupled. In particular, at least a portion of interconnect 16 is embedded
within an extended portion of electrolyte layer 26, wherein the extended portion of
electrolyte layer 26 is a portion of electrolyte layer 26 that extends beyond anode 40
and cathode 42, e.g., in direction 32, and is not sandwiched between anode 40 and
cathode 42.
             Referring to FIG. 3, some aspects of a non-limiting example of interconnect 16
are described in greater detail. Interconnect 16 includes a blind primary conductor 52,
and two blind auxiliary conductors, or vias 54, 56. Blind primary conductor 52 is

sandwiched between electrolyte sub-layer 26A and electrolyte sub-layer 26B, and is
formed of a body 58 extending between a blind end 60 and a blind end 62 opposite end
60. Blind- primary conductor 52 defines a conduction path encased within electrolyte
layer 26 and oriented along direction 36, i.e., to conduct a flow of electrons in a direction
substantially parallel to direction 36. Blind auxiliary conductor 54 has a blind end 64,
and blind auxiliary conductor 56 has a blind end 66. Blind auxiliary conductors 54 and
56 are oriented in direction 32. As that term is used herein, "blind" relates to the
conductor not extending straight through electrolyte layer 26 in the direction of
orientation of the conductor, i.e., in the manner of a "blind hole" that ends in a structure,
as opposed to a "through hole" that passes through the structure. Rather, the blind
ends face portions of electrolyte layer 26. For example, end 64 of conductor 54 faces
portion 68 electrolyte sub-layer 26B and is not able to "see" through electrolyte sub
layer 26B. Similarly, end 66 of conductor 56 faces portion 70 of electrolyte sub-layer
26A and is not able to "see" through electrolyte sub-layer 26A. Likewise, ends 60 and
62 of body 58 face portions 72 and 74, respectively, and are not able to "see" through
electrolyte sub-layer 26A.
             In the embodiment of FIG. 3, various features, components and interrelationships
therebetween of aspects of an embodiment of the present invention are depicted.
However, the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiment of FIG. 3 and
the components, features and interrelationships therebetween as are illustrated in FIG.
3 and described herein. It will be understood that FIG. 3 is not to scale; for example,
vertical dimensions are exaggerated for purposes of clarity of illustration.
             In the present embodiment, blind primary conductor 52 is a conductive film
created with a screen printing process, which is embedded within electrolyte layer 26,
sandwiched between electrolyte sub-layers 26A and 26B. Anode layer 24 is oriented
along a first plane, cathode layer 28 is oriented along a second plane substantially
parallel to the first plane, electrolyte layer 26 is oriented along a third plane substantially
parallel to the first plane, and the conductive film forming blind primary conductor 52
extends in a direction substantially parallel to the first plane.

             In one form, the material of blind primary conductor 52 may be a precious metal

may be employed in addition to or in place of a precious metal cermet or an electrically
conductive ceramic, e.g., a precious metal, such as Ag, Pd, Au and/or Pt, although
other materials may be employed without departing from the scope of the present

materials may be employed, including precious metal alloys, such as Ag-Pd, Ag-Au, Ag
Pt, Au-Pd, Au-Pt, Pt-Pd, Ag-Au-Pd, Ag-Au-Pt, and Ag-Au-Pd-Pt, cermets composed of
precious metal or alloys, Ni metal and/or Ni alloy, and an inert ceramic phase, such as
alumina, or ceramic phase with minimum ionic conductivity which will not generate
significant parasitic current, such as YSZ, ScSZ, and/or conductive ceramics, such as at
least one of LNF (LaNixFe 1.x0 3), LSM (Lai-xSrxMnO 3), doped strontium titanate, doped
yttrium chromites, LSCM (La1.xSrxCr1 .yMnyO 3), and/or other doped lanthanum chromites,
and conductive ceramics, such as LNF (LaNixFe 1 .x03), for example, LaNio.6 Feo.40 3 , LSM
(Lal-xSrxMnO 3), such as Lao       75Sro.2 5 MnO 3 , doped strontium titanate, doped yttrium
chromites, LSCM (La1.xSrxCr 1 .yMnyO 3), such as Lao 75 Sro.25 Cro.5 Mno05 O 3 , and other
doped lanthanum chromites. In other embodiments, it is contemplated that blind
primary conductor 52 may be formed of a Ni metal cermet and/or a Ni alloy cermet in
addition to or in place of the materials mentioned above. The Ni metal cermet and/or
the Ni alloy cermet may have one or more ceramic phases, for example and without
limitation, a ceramic phase being YSZ, alumina, ScSZ, doped ceria and/or TiO 2 . In
various embodiments, blind primary conductor 52 may be formed of materials set forth
above with respect to interconnect 16.
             One example of materials for blind primary conductor 52 is y(PdxPt 1.x)-(1-y)YSZ.
Where x is from 0 to 1 in weight ratio. For cost reduction, x is preferred in the range of
0.5 to 1. For better performance and higher system efficiency, x is prefered in the range
of 0 to 0.5. Because hydrogen has higher flux in Pd. Y is from 0.35 to 0.80 in volume
ratio, preferably y is in the range of 0.4 to 0.6.
             Another example of materials for blind primary conductor 52 is x%Pd-y%Ni-(100
x-y)%YSZ, where x=70-80, y=5-10.

             Each of blind auxiliary conductors 54 and 56 may be formed from the same or
different materials than primary conductor 52. In one form, blind auxiliary conductor 54
is formed during processing of blind primary conductor 52 and from the same material
as blind primary conductor 52, whereas blind auxiliary conductor 56 is formed at the
same process step as cathode conductive layer 30 and from the same material as
cathode conductive layer 30. However, in other embodiments, blind primary conductor
52, blind auxiliary conductor 54 and blind auxiliary conductor 56 may be made from
other material combinations without departing from the scope of the present invention.
             The materials used for blind auxiliary conductor 54 and blind auxiliary conductor
56 may vary with the particular application. For example, with some material
combinations, material migration may occur at the interface of interconnect 16 with
anode conductive layer 22 and/or cathode conductive layer 30 during either cell
fabrication or cell testing, which may cause increased resistance at the interface and
higher cell degradation during fuel cell operation. Material may migrate into primary
conductor 52 from anode conductive layer 22 and/or cathode conductive layer 30,
and/or material may migrate from primary conductor 52 into anode conductive layer 22
and/or cathode conductive layer 30, depending upon the compositions of primary
conductor 52, anode conductive layer 22 and cathode conductive layer 30. To reduce
material migration at the interconnect/conductive layer interface, one or both of blind
auxiliary conductor 54 and blind auxiliary conductor 56 may be formed from a material
that yields an electrically conductive chemical barrier layer between primary conductor
52 and a respective one or both of anode conductive layer 22 (anode conductor film 48)
and/or cathode conductive layer 30 (cathode conductor film 50). This chemical barrier
may eliminate or reduce material migration during fuel cell fabrication and operation.

layer 22 interface that may be used to form a chemical barrier may include, but are not
limited to Ni cermet, Ni-precious metal cermet and the precious metal can be Ag, Au,
Pd, Pt, or the alloy of them, the ceramic phase in the cermet can be at least one of YSZ

distance 80 for any hydrogen that may diffuse through interconnect 16, e.g., due to
sintering porosity, microcracks, voids and/or other defects introduced into interconnect
16 during processing. In the present embodiment, diffusion distance 80 is 0.6 mm,

RORO-2420                                                                    KDIM-9843732_2
although greater or lesser widths may be used without departing from the scope of the
present invention. The film thickness 82 of primary conductor 52, i.e., as measured in
direction 32, is approximately 5-15 microns. The total height 84 of interconnect 16 in
direction 32 is approximately 10-25 microns, which generally corresponds to the
thickness of electrolyte layer 26.
             The total diffusion distance for hydrogen diffusing through interconnect 16 may
include the height of auxiliary conductor 54 and auxiliary conductor 56 in direction 32,
which may be given by subtracting from the total height 84 the film thickness 82 of
primary conductor 52, which yields approximately 10 microns. Thus, the diffusion
distance is predominantly controlled by diffusion distance 80, e.g., since the heights of
auxiliary conductors 54 and 56 represent only a small fraction of the total diffusion
distance.
             Referring to FIGS. 4A and 4B, a plan view of a continuous "strip" configuration of
interconnect 16 and a plan view of a "via" configuration of interconnect 16 are
respectively depicted. The term, "strip," pertains to the configuration being in the form
of a single long conductor that is comparatively narrow in width as compared to length.
In the strip configuration, the primary conductor takes the form of a continuous strip 52A
extending in a direction 86 that in the present embodiment is substantially perpendicular
to both directions 32 and 36, and runs approximately the length in direction 86 of
electrochemical cell 12. In the depiction of FIGS. 4A and 4B, direction 32 extends into
and out of the plane of the drawing, and hence is represented by an "X" within a circle.
The term, "via," pertains to a relatively small conductive pathway through a material that
connects electrical components. In the depiction of FIG. 4B, the primary conductor
takes the form of a plurality of vias 52B, e.g., each having a width in direction 86 of only
approximately 0.4 mm, although greater or lesser widths may be used without departing
from the scope of the present invention.
             In the embodiment of FIGS. 4A and 4B, various features, components and
interrelationships therebetween of aspects of an embodiment of the present invention
are depicted. However, the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiment
                                                   20

RORO-2420                                                                   KDIM-9843732_2
of FIGS. 4A and 4B and the components, features and interrelationships therebetween
as are illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B and described herein.
             Referring again to FIG. 3, in conjunction with FIGS. 4A and 4B, the minimum
diffusion area of interconnect 16 is controlled by the diffusion area of primary conductor
52, which serves as a diffusion flow orifice that restricts the diffusion of fluid. For
example, if, for any reason, primary conductor 52 is not non-porous, fluid, e.g., oxidant
and fuel in liquid and/or gaseous form may diffuse through interconnect 16. Such
diffusion is controlled, in part, by the film thickness 82. In the "strip" configuration, the
diffusion area is given by the width of continuous strip 52A in direction 86 times the film
thickness 82, whereas in the "via" configuration, the diffusion area is given by the width
of each via 52B in direction 86 times the film thickness 82 times the number of vias 52B.
             Although it may be possible to employ an interconnect that extends only in
direction 32 from anode conductor film 48 to cathode conductor film 50 (assuming that
cathode conductor film 50 were positioned above anode conductor films 48 in direction
36), such a scheme would result in higher leakage than were the interconnect of the
present invention employed.
             For example, referring to FIG. 5, some aspects of a non-limiting example of an
interconnect 88 are depicted, wherein interconnect 88 in the form of a via passing
through an electrolyte layer 90, which is clearly not embedded in electrolyte layer 90 or
sandwiched between sub-layers of electrolyte layer 90, and does not include any blind
conductors. Interconnect 88 transfers electrical power from an anode conductor 92 to a
cathode conductor 94. For purposes of comparison, the length 96 of interconnect 88 in
direction 32, which corresponds to the thickness of electrolyte layer 90, is assumed to
be the 10-15 microns, e.g., similar to interconnect 16, and the width of interconnect 88,
e.g., the width of the open slot in the electrolyte 96 into which interconnect 88 is printed,
in direction 36 is assumed to be the minimum printable via dimension 98 in direction 36
with current industry technology, which is approximately 0.25 mm. The length of
interconnect 88 in direction 86 is assumed to be 0.4 mm. Thus, with interconnect 88,
the diffusion flow area for one via is approximately 0.25 mm times 0.4 mm, which equals
                                                  21
9843732 2 (GHMatters) P100924.AU.1

RORO-2420                                                                      KDIM-9843732_2
0.1 mm 2 . The limiting dimension is the minimum 0.25 mm screen printed via dimension
98.
             With the present invention, however, assuming via 52B (FIG. 4B) to have the
same length in direction 86 of 0.4 mm, the diffusion flow area for one via of 0.4 mm
times the film thickness in direction 32 of 0.010 mm (10 microns) equals .004 mm 2
which is only 4 percent of the flow area of interconnect 88. Thus, by employing a
geometry that allows a reduction of the minimum dimension that limits a minimum
diffusion flow area, the diffusion flow area of the interconnect may be reduced, thereby
potentially decreasing diffusion of oxidant and/or fuel through the interconnector, e.g., in
the event the interconnect is not fully non-porous (such as, for example, due to process
limitations and/or manufacturing defects), or the interconnect is a mixed ion and
electronic conductor.
             Further, the diffusion distance in interconnect 88 corresponds to the thickness 96
of interconnect 88, which in the depicted example is also the thickness of electrolyte
layer 90, i.e., 10-15 microns.
             In contrast, the diffusion distance of the inventive blind primary connector 52,
whether in the form of a continuous strip 52A or a via 52B, is diffusion distance 80,
which is 0.6 mm, and which is 40-60 times the diffusion distance of interconnect 88 (0.6
mm divided by 10-15 microns), which is many times the thickness of the electrolyte.
Thus, by employing a geometry wherein the diffusion distance extends in a direction not
limited by the thickness of the electrolyte, the diffusion distance of the interconnect may
be substantially increased, thereby potentially decreasing diffusion of oxidant and/or fuel
through the interconnector.
             Generally, the flow of fuel and/or air through an interconnect made from a given
material and microstructure depends on the flow area and flow distance. Some
embodiments of the present invention may reduce fuel and/or air flow through the
interconnect by 102 to 104 magnitude, e.g., if the connector is not non-porous,
depending on the specific dimension of the interconnect used.
             For example, processing-related defects such as sintering porosity, microcracks
and voids are typically from sub-microns to a few microns in size (voids) or a few
                                                    22

microns to 10 microns (microcracks). With a diffusion distance of only 10-15 microns,
the presence of a defect may provide a direct flowpath through the interconnect, or at
least decrease the diffusion distance by a substantial percentage. For example,
assume a design diffusion distance of 10 microns. In the presence of a 10 micron
defect, a direct flowpath for the flow of hydrogen and/or oxidant would occur, since such
a defect would open a direct pathway through the interconnect (it is noted that the
anode/conductive layer and cathode/conductive layer are intentionally porous). Even
assuming a design diffusion distance of 15 microns in the presence of a 10 micron
defect, the diffusion distance would be reduced by 67%, leaving a net diffusion distance
of only 5 microns.
             On the other hand, a 10 micron defect in the inventive interconnect 16 would
have only negligible effect on the 0.6 mm design diffusion distance of primary conductor
52, i.e., reducing the 0.6 mm design diffusion distance to 0.59 mm, which is a relatively
inconsequential reduction caused by the presence of the defect.
             Referring to FIGS. 6A and 6B, some aspects of a non-limiting example of an
embodiment of the present invention having a blind primary conductor in the form of a
via 52C extending in direction 86 are depicted. In the depiction of FIG. 6A, direction 32
extends into and out of the plane of the drawing, and hence is represented by an "X"
within a circle. In the depiction of FIG. 6B, direction 36 extends into and out of the plane
of the drawing, and hence is represented by an "X" within a circle. Via 52C is similar to
via 52B, except that it extends in direction 86 rather than direction 36, for example, as
indicated by diffusion distance 80 being oriented in direction 86. It will be understood
that although FIGS. 6A and 6B depict only a single via 52C, embodiments of the
present invention may include a plurality of such vias extending along direction 86.
             The direction of electron flow in FIGS. 6A and 6B is illustrated by three
dimensional flowpath line 100. Electrons flow in direction 36 through anode conductor
film 48 toward auxiliary conductor 54, and then flow in direction 32 through auxiliary
conductor 54 toward via 52C. The electrons then flow in direction 86 through via 52C
toward auxiliary conductor 56, and then flow in direction 32 through auxiliary conductor
                                                  23

             Referring to FIG. 7, some aspects of a non-limiting example of an embodiment of
a fuel cell system 210 are schematically depicted. Fuel cell system 210 includes a
plurality of electrochemical cells 212 disposed on a substrate 214, each electrochemical
cell 212 having a seal in the form of a ceramic seal 102. Fuel cell system 210 also
includes the components set forth above and described with respect to fuel cell system
10, e.g., including interconnects 16 having blind primary conductors 52 and blind
auxiliary conductors or vias 54 and 56; an oxidant side 18; a fuel side 20; electrolyte
layers 26; anodes 40; cathodes 42, anode conductor films 48 and cathode conductor
films 50. The description of substrate 14 applies equally to substrate 214. In the
embodiment of FIG. 7, auxiliary conductor 56 of interconnect 16 is formed of the same
material as cathode conductor film 50, whereas auxiliary conductor 54 of interconnect
16 is formed of the same material as anode conductor film 48. Blind primary conductor
52 of interconnect 16 is formed of the same material described above with respect to
interconnect 16 in the embodiment of FIG. 2. In other embodiments, for example,
auxiliary conductor 54 and/or auxiliary conductor 56 may be formed of the same
material as blind primary conductor 52, or may be formed of different materials. In one
form, blind primary conductor 52 is in the form of a continuous strip, e.g., continuous
strip 52A depicted in FIG. 4A. In another form, blind primary conductor 52 is in the form
of a plurality of vias, such as vias 52B in FIG. 4B. In other embodiments, blind primary
conductor 52 may take other forms not explicitly set forth herein.
                 In one form, ceramic seal 102 is applied onto porous substrate 214, and is
positioned horizontally (in the perspective of FIG. 7) between the anode conductor film
48 of one electrochemical cell 212 and the auxiliary conductor 54 of the adjacent
                                                   24

electrochemical cell 212. In other embodiments, ceramic seal 102 may be located in
other orientations and locations. Ceramic seal 102 has a thickness, i.e., as measured in
direction 32, of approximately 5-30 microns, although other thickness values may be
employed in other embodiments. In one form, ceramic seal 102 is impervious to gases
and liquids, such as the fuel and oxidants employed by electrochemical cells 212, and is
configured to prevent the leakage of gases and liquids from substrate 214 in those
areas where it is applied. In other embodiments, ceramic seal 102 may be substantially
impervious to gases and liquids, and may be configured to reduce leakage of gases and
liquids from substrate 214 in those areas where it is applied, e.g., relative to other
configurations that do not employ a ceramic seal. Ceramic seal 102 is configured to
provide an essentially "gas-tight" seal between substrate 214 and fuel cell components
disposed on the side of ceramic seal 102 opposite of that of substrate 214.
             In one form, ceramic seal 102 is positioned to prevent or reduce leakage of
gases and liquids from substrate 214 into interconnect 16. In one form, ceramic seal
102 extends in direction 36, and is positioned vertically (in direction 32) between porous
substrate 214 on the bottom and blind primary conductor 52 of interconnect 16 and
electrolyte 26 on the top, thereby preventing the leakages of gases and liquids into the
portions of blind primary conductor 52 (and electrolyte 26) that are overlapped by
ceramic seal 102. In other embodiments, ceramic seal 102 may be disposed in other
suitable locations in addition to or in place of that illustrated in FIG. 7. Blind primary
conductor 52 is embedded between a portion of ceramic seal 102 on the bottom and a
portion of extended electrolyte 26 on the top. The diffusion distance in the embodiment
of FIG. 7 is primarily defined by the length of the overlap of interconnect 16 by both
ceramic seal 102 and electrolyte 26 in direction 36. In one form, the overlap is 0.3-0.6
mm, although in other embodiments, other values may be employed. Interconnect 16
extends into the active electrochemical cell 212 area. In some embodiments, the
primary interconnect area of the configuration illustrated in FIG. 7 may be smaller than
other designs, which may increase the total active cell area on substrate 214, which
may increase the efficiency of fuel cell system 210.
             Ceramic seal 102 is formed from a ceramic material. In one form, the ceramic
material used to form ceramic seal 102 is yittria stabilized zirconia, such as 3YSZ. In

another form, the material used to form ceramic seal 102 is scandia stabilized zirconia,
such as 4ScSZ. In another form, the material used to form ceramic seal 102 is alumina.
In another form, the material used to form ceramic seal 102 is non-conductive
pyrochlore materials, such as La2 Zr 2 O7 . Other embodiments may employ other
ceramics, e.g., depending upon various factors, such as compatibility with the materials
of adjacent portions of each electrochemical cell 212 and substrate 214, the fuels and
oxidants employed by fuel cell system 210, and the local transient and steady-state
operating temperatures of fuel cell system 210. Still other embodiments may employ
materials other than ceramics.
             In the embodiment of FIG. 7, various features, components and interrelationships
therebetween of aspects of an embodiment of the present invention are depicted.
However, the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiment of FIG. 7 and
the components, features and interrelationships therebetween as are illustrated in FIG.

             Referring to FIG. 8, some aspects of a non-limiting example of an embodiment of
a fuel cell system 310 are schematically depicted. Fuel cell system 310 includes a
plurality of electrochemical cells 312 disposed on a substrate 314, each electrochemical
cell 312 including a ceramic seal 102. Fuel cell system 310 also includes the
components set forth above and described with respect to fuel cell system 10, e.g.,
including interconnects 16 having blind primary conductors 52 and blind auxiliary
conductors or vias 54 and 56; an oxidant side 18; a fuel side 20; electrolyte layers 26;
anodes 40; cathodes 42, anode conductor films 48 and cathode conductor films 50.
The description of substrate 14 applies equally to substrate 314. In the embodiment of
FIG. 8, interconnect 16 is formed predominantly by the material of anode conductor film
48, and hence, blind primary conductor 52 and auxiliary conductor 54 in the
embodiment of FIG. 8 may be considered as extensions of anode conductor film 48.
For example, blind primary conductor 52 and auxiliary conductor 54 are depicted as
being formed by the material of anode conductor film 48, whereas auxiliary conductor
56 is formed of the materials set forth above for interconnect 16 in the embodiment of
FIG. 2. In one form, blind primary conductor 52 is in the form of a continuous strip, e.g.,
continuous strip 52A depicted in FIG. 4A. In another form, blind primary conductor 52 is
                                                 26

in the form of a plurality of vias, such as vias 52B in FIG. 4B. In other embodiments,
blind primary conductor 52 may take other forms not explicitly set forth herein.
             Ceramic seal 102 is positioned to prevent or reduce leakage of gases and liquids
from substrate 314 into interconnect 16. In one form, ceramic seal 102 is positioned
vertically (in direction 32) between porous substrate 314 on the bottom and blind
primary conductor 52 and electrolyte 26 on the top, thereby preventing the leakages of
gases and liquids into the portions of blind primary conductor 52 that are overlapped by
ceramic seal 102.                  Blind primary conductor 52 is embedded between a portion of
ceramic seal 102 on the bottom and extended electrolyte 26 on the top. The diffusion
distance in the embodiment of FIG. 8 is primarily defined by the length of the overlap of
interconnect 16 by both ceramic seal 102 and electrolyte 26 in direction 36. In one
form, the overlap is 0.3-0.6 mm, although in other embodiments, other values may be
employed.
             Because ceramic seal 102 prevents the ingress of gas and liquids into
electrochemical cell 312, interconnect 16 does not need to be as dense (in order to
prevent or reduce leakage) as other designs that do not include a seal, such as ceramic
seal 102. In such designs, interconnect 16 may be formed of the materials used to form
anode conductor layer 48 and/or cathode conductor layer 50. For example, referring to
FIG. 9, an embodiment is depicted wherein interconnect 16 is formed entirely of the
materials used to form anode conductor layer 48 and cathode conductor layer 50. FIG.
9 schematically depicts some aspects of a non-limiting example of an embodiment of a
fuel cell system 410. Fuel cell system 410 includes a plurality of electrochemical cells
412 disposed on a substrate 414, each electrochemical cell 412 including a ceramic
seal 102. Fuel cell system 410 also includes the components set forth above and
described with respect to fuel cell system 10, e.g., including interconnects 16 having
blind primary conductors 52 and blind auxiliary conductors or vias 54 and 56; an oxidant
side 18; a fuel side 20; electrolyte layers 26; anodes 40; cathodes 42, anode conductor
films 48 and cathode conductor films 50. The description of substrate 14 applies
equally to substrate 414. In the embodiment of FIG. 9, blind primary conductor 52 and
auxiliary conductor 54 are formed of the same material used to form anode conductor
film 48, and are formed in the same process steps used to form anode conductor film
                                                          27

48. Hence, blind primary conductor 52 and auxiliary conductor 54 in the embodiment of
FIG. 9 may be considered as extensions of anode conductor film 48. Similarly, in the
embodiment of FIG. 9, auxiliary conductor 56 is formed of the same material used to
form cathode conductor film 50, and is formed in the same process steps used to form
cathode conductor film 50. Hence, auxiliary conductor 56 in the embodiment of FIG. 9
may be considered as an extension of cathode conductor film 50.
             In the embodiments of FIGS. 8 and 9, various features, components and
interrelationships therebetween of aspects of embodiments of the present invention are
depicted. However, the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiments of
FIGS. 8 and 9 and the components, features and interrelationships therebetween as are
illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9 and described herein.
             Referring to FIGS. 10-15 generally, the inventors have determined that material
diffusion between the interconnect and adjacent components, e.g., an anode and/or an
anode conductor film and/or cathode and/or cathode conductor film, may adversely
affect the performance of certain fuel cell systems. Hence, some embodiments of the
present invention include an electrically conductive chemical barrier (e.g., as discussed
above, and/or chemical barrier 104, discussed below with respect to FIGS. 10-15) to
prevent or reduce such material diffusion. In various embodiments, chemical barrier
104 may be configured to prevent or reduce material migration or diffusion at the
interface between the interconnect and an anode, and and/or between the interconnect
and an anode conductor film, and/or between the interconnect and a cathode, and
and/or between the interconnect and a cathode conductor film which may improve the
long term durability of the interconnect. For example, without a chemical barrier,
material migration (diffusion) may take place at the interface between an interconnect
formed of a precious metal cermet, and an anode conductor film and/or anode formed
of a Ni-based cermet. The material migration may take place in both directions, e.g., Ni
migrating from the anode conductive layer/conductor film and/or anode into the
interconnect, and precious metal migrating from the interconnect into the conductive
layer/conductor film and/or anode. The material migration may result in increased
porosity at or near the interface between the interconnect and the anode conductor film
and/or anode, and may result in the enrichment of one or more non or low-electronic

conducting phases at the interface, yielding a higher area specific resistance (ASR),
and hence resulting in reduced fuel cell performance. Material migration between the
interconnect and the cathode and/or between the interconnect and the cathode
conductor film may also or alternatively result in deleterious effects on fuel cell
performance.
              Accordingly, some embodiments employ a chemical barrier, e.g., chemical
barrier 104, that is configured to prevent or reduce material migration or diffusion at the
interface between the interconnect and an adjacent electrically conductive component,
such as one or more of an anode, an anode conductive layer/conductor film, a cathode
and/or a cathode conductive layer/conductor film, and hence prevent or reduce material
migration (diffusion) that might otherwise result in deleterious effect, e.g., the formation
of porosity and the enrichment of one or more non or low-electronic conducting phases
at the interface. Chemical barrier 104 may be formed of one or both of two classes of
materials; cermet and/or conductive ceramic. For the cermet, the ceramic phase may
be one or more of an inert filler; a ceramic with low ionic conductivity, such as YSZ; and
an electronic conductor. In various embodiments, e.g., for the anode side (e.g., for use
adjacent to an anode and/or anode conductive layer/conductor film), chemical barrier
104 may be formed of one or more materials, including, without limitation, Ni cermet or
Ni-precious metal cermet. The precious metal phase may be, for example and without
limitation, one or more of Ag, Au, Pd, Pt, or one or more alloys of Ag, Au, Pd and/or Pt.
The ceramic phase in the cermet may be, for example and without limitation, be at least
one of YSZ (such as 3YSZ), ScSZ (such as 4ScSZ), doped ceria (such as GdO.1 Ceo.9
02),     SrZrO 3 , pyrochlores of the composition (MRE)2Zr2O7 (where MRE    =  one or more rare
earth cations, for example and without limitation La, Pr, Nd, Gd, Sm, Ho, Er, and/or Yb),
for example and without limitation, La 2 Zr 2 O7 and Pr 2 Zr 2O7 , alumina, and TiO 2 , or one or
more electronically conductive ceramics, such as doped ceria (higher electronic
conductivity at lower oxygen partial pressure to provide low enough ASR due to thin
film), doped strontium titanate, LSCM (La 1.xSrxCr 1.yMnyO 3, x=0.15-0.35, y=0.25-0.5),
and/or other doped lanthanum chromites and doped yttria chromites. In various
embodiments, e.g., for the cathode side(e.g., for use adjacent to a cathode and/or
cathode conductive layer/conductor film), chemical barrier 104 may be formed of one or
                                                 29

pyrochlores of the composition (MRE)2Zr2O7 (where MRE = one or more rare earth
cations, for example and without limitation La, Pr, Nd, Gd, Sm, Ho, Er, and/or Yb), for
example and without limitation, La 2 Zr 2O 7 and Pr 2Zr 2O 7 , alumina, and TiO 2 , or one or
more electronically conductive ceramics, such as LNF (LaNixFe 1 .x03, such as x=0.6)
LSM (LaixSrxMnO 3, x=0.15-0.3), LCM (such as Lao.8Cao.2MnO 3), Ruddlesden-Popper
nickelates, LSF (such as La 0 .8 Sr 0 .2 FeO 3 ), LSCF (LaoSro4 C00o. 2 Feo.8 O 3 ), LSCM (La 1 .
xSrxCr       1 .yMnyO 3 , x=O.15-0.35, y=0.5-0.75) doped yttrium chromites, and other doped
lanthanum chromites. The selection of the specific material(s) for chemical barrier 104
may vary with the needs of the application, e.g., depending upon cost, ease of
manufacturing, the type of materials used for the component(s) electrically adjacent to
interconnect 16 and/or one of its subcomponents, e.g., blind primary conductor 52,
auxiliary conductor 54 and auxiliary conductor 56.
             One example of anode side chemical barrier materials is 15%Pd, 19%NiO,
66%NTZ, where NTZ is 73.6wt% NiO, 20.0%TiO 2, 6.4% YSZ.
             Another example of anode side chemical barrier materials is doped ceria, such
as Gdo.1 Ceo. 9 02.
             Experimental testing with a chemical barrier, such as chemical barrier 104, in a
fuel cell system yielded approximately 0.1% per thousand hour degradation rate in cell
power output over the course of 1300 hours of testing using a chemical barrier formed
of 30wt%Pd-70wt%NTZ cermet (NTZ = NiO 2-3YSZ), disposed between an interconnect
formed of 65Pd35Pt-YSZ cermet and an anode conductive layer formed of 20wt%Pd
Ni-spinel. In a comparative test, but without the inclusion of a chemical barrier, such as
chemical barrier 104, an interconnect formed of 50v%(96Pd6Au)-50v%YSZ cermet
directly interfacing with an anode conductive layer formed of 20wt%Pd-Ni-spinel
showed significant degradation in about 10 hours of testing, and fuel cell failure at about
25 hours of testing resulting from material migration between the interconnect and the
                                                    30

barrier 104 formed of a conductive ceramic (10mol%Gd doped CeO 2) disposed
between disposed between an anode conductor film and an interconnect. ASR for the
interconnect showed no degradation after approximately 8000 hours of testing, and
instead showed slight improvement, yielding final values of .05 ohm-cm 2 and .06 ohm
cm2 in the two test articles.

FIGS. 10-15 and the components, features and interrelationships therebetween as are
illustrated in FIGS. 10-15 and described herein.
             Referring to FIGS. 16-19 generally, the inventors have determined that in some
fuel cells, under some operating conditions, the cathode conductive layer/conductor
film, the electrolyte, and portions of the interconnect, e.g., vias, can form parasitic cells
within or between each electrochemical cell, particularly where there is overlap between
the cathode conductive layer/conductor film and the electrolyte. In the parasitic cells,
the cathode conductive layer/conductor film functions as a cathode, and the
interconnect, e.g., vias formed of precious metal cermet, function as an anode. The
parasitic cells consume fuel during fuel cell operation, thereby reducing the efficiency of
the fuel cell system. In addition, the steam generated by the parasitic cells may create
local high oxygen partial pressure that may result in the oxidation of Ni that may have
diffused into precious metal phase of the interconnect (e.g., via) materials, resulting in
degradation of the interconnect.

             The inventors performed tests that confirmed the existence of parasitic cells.
The tests confirmed that, although significant degradation did not occur at some
temperatures, e.g., 900 0C, under the testing times, degradation of the interconnect
occurred at higher operating temperatures, e.g., 925 0 C after approximately 700 hours of
testing. Post test analysis showed Ni migration from the anode conductive
layer/conductor film side to the cathode conductive layer/conductor film side of the
interconnect through the precious metal phase in blind primary conductor 52, which was
accelerated by the higher operating temperature. A high oxygen partial pressure
resulting from steam formed by the parasitic cells caused Ni oxidation at the interface of
extended electrolyte 26 and blind primary interconnect 52 near the boundary between
the cathode conductive layer/conductor film and the electrolyte, which segregated from
the precious metal of the interconnect. Continued NiO accumulation at the interface
between the blind primary conductor 52 and the electrolyte 26, and continued Ni
migration would likely result in failure of the interconnect.
             In order to prevent overlap between the cathode conductive layer/conductor film
and the electrolyte, in various embodiments the inventors employed a separation
feature (gap 106 of FIGS. 16 and 17; and insulator 108 of FIGS. 18 and 19) between
the cathode conductive layer/conductor film and the electrolyte to separate, i.e., space
apart, the cathode conductive layer/conductor film and the electrolyte from contacting
each other, thus eliminating the parasitic cells. Testing of fuel cell systems with a
separation feature in the form of gap 106 (and also including a chemical barrier 104
formed of Pd-Ni alloy cermet) for approximately 2000 hours, including approximately
1000 hours at aggressive conditions (925 0 C and fuel consisting of 20% H2 , 10% CO,
19% CO 2 , 47% steam and 4% N2) did not result in degradation of the interconnect.
Accordingly, some embodiments of the present invention include a separation feature,
e.g., gap 106, between the cathode conductive layer/conductor film and the electrolyte,
which prevents the establishment of parasitic cells.

             In the embodiments of FIGS. 16-19, various features, components and

             As mentioned above with respect to FIGS. 16-19, under certain conditions,
parasitic cells may be undesirably formed. The embodiments discussed above with
respect to FIGS. 16-19 provide certain approaches to resolving the parasitic cell

and/or vias (e.g., interconnect 16, including blind primary conductor 52, auxiliary
conductor 54 and/or auxiliary conductor 56, and/or other interconnect and/or via
configurations not mentioned herein) are formed. In one form, for an alternate cermet
material, precious metal- La2 Zr 2 O7 pyrochlore cermet may be employed for primary
interconnect material for segmented-in-series fuel cell, or via material for multi-layer
ceramic interconnect. In the such a cermet material, La2 Zr 2 O7 pyrochlore could fully
replace doped zirconia, or partially replace doped zirconia to keep ionic phase below its
percolation to eliminate or reduce ionic conduction.
             In one form, the composition of the interconnect and/or via(s), e.g., one or more
of the previously mentioned compositions for the interconnect and/or via(s), is altered to
include non-ionic conducting ceramic phases in the composition of the interconnect
and/or via(s).
             For example, in one form, the interconnect and/or via may be formed, all or in
part, of a cermet, such as those previously described with respect to interconnect 16,
including blind primary conductor 52, auxiliary conductor 54 and/or auxiliary conductor
56, but also or alternatively including one or more non-ionic conductive ceramic phases.
Examples include, without limitation, SrZrO 3, La2 Zr 2 O7 pyrochlore, Pr 2 Zr 2 O7 pyrochlore,
BaZrO 3 , MgA12 O4 spinel, NiA12O4 spinel, MgCr 2 O4 spinel, NiCr 2O 4 spinel, Y 3 Al5 0 1 2 and
other garnets with various A- and B-site substitution, and alumina. Other non-ionic
conductive ceramic phases are also contemplated herein in addition to or in place of the
examples set forth herein. Considerations for materials may include the coefficient of
thermal expansion of the ceramic phase(s), e.g., relative to the coefficient thermal
expansion of the porous substrate. In some embodiments, preferred materials for
chemical compatibility with adjacent fuel cell layers may include precious metal
pyrochlore cermets, wherein the general class of pyrochlores is        (MRE)2Zr2O7,   wherein
MRE is a rare earth cation, for example and without limtiation La, Pr, Nd, Gd, Sm, Ho, Er,
and/or Yb.
             In other embodiments, nonionic phases such as SrZrO 3, MgA12O4 spinel, NiA12O4
spinel, alumina and pyrochlore compositions partially or completely replace the ionic
conducting YSZ, e.g., of previously described interconnects and/or vias. Preferably,

pyrochlore powders and/or one or more of the other nonionic phases replace YSZ
sufficiently to render the balance of the YSZ to be below a percolation threshold to
eliminate ionic conductivity across the interconnect/via. The YSZ volume fraction of the
via is purposely reduced to less than 30v% to minimize any ionic conductivity within the
via material.
             In one form, the composition of the interconnect and/or via(s), e.g., one or more
of the previously mentioned compositions for the interconnect and/or via(s), is altered to
include a reactant phase to form non-ionic conducting ceramic phases during firing of
the fuel cell, e.g., by the inclusion of rare earth oxides in the compound used to form the
interconnect/via(s).
             For example, in some embodiments, all or portions interconnect 16 or other
interconnects or vias may include a reactant phase in the form of rare earth oxide, e.g.,
within the screen printing ink, at less than the stoichiometric ratio to form pyrochlore
being one mole of the oxides of La, Pr, Nd, Gd, Sm, Ho, Er, Yb to two moles of the
zirconia content of the via. In the overall cermet composition (e.g., cermet compositions
for all or part of interconnect 16 set forth herein) which reacts with the YSZ during firing
of the fuel cell to form pyrochlore within the interconnect/via and adjacent to the
electrolyte, e.g., electrolyte 26. In one form, the minimum rare earth oxide required is
about 13mole% ceramic composition in order to reduce YSZ phase below 30v%
percolation. In other embodiments, other rare earth oxide amounts may be employed.
The zirconia phase may still be able to exist at greater than the percolation threshold,
since the insulating pyrochlore phase could form along grain boundaries. However, in
some embodiments, it would be preferable to add sufficient rare earth oxides to take the
YSZ phase content to below the percolation threshold on a bulk composition basis.
Similar to the pyrochlores, SrZrO 3 nonionic phases could be created in-situ through
addition of SrO powder as a reactant phase, e.g., to the interconnect inks, at less than
the stoichimetric ratio of 1 mole SrO to 1 mole ZrO 2.
             In still other embodiments, all or portions interconnect 16 or other interconnects
or vias may include a content of rare earth oxide, e.g., within the screen printing ink, at
greater than the stoichiometric ratio of pyrochlore being one mole of the oxides, e.g., of
                                                   43

La, Pr, Nd, Gd, Sm, Ho, Er, and/or Yb, to two moles of the zirconia content of the via in
the overall cermet composition (e.g., cermet compositions for all or part of interconnect
16 set forth herein) which reacts with the YSZ during firing of the fuel cell to form
pyrochlore within the interconnect/via, and the unreacted rare earth oxide will further
react with the extended electrolyte in the vicinity of the interconnect during electrolyte
firing to form a pyrochlore film on the electrolyte surface, e.g., on the surface of
electrolyte 26, which will sufficiently disrupt the pathways for oxygen ionic conductivity.
In form, the rare earth oxide amount is from 33mole% to 50mole% based on the total
ceramic phase. In other embodiments, other rare earth oxide amounts may be
employed. The excess rare earth oxide may ensure the absence of ionic conductivity.
However, too much excess rare earth remaining within the interconnect/via could cause
the via to be susceptible to moisture induced damage on phase change to the rare earth
hydroxides. Hence, it is desirable in some embodiments to limit the amount of rare
earth oxides to less than 10% over the stoichiometric ratio. Similar to the pyrochlores,
SrZrO 3 nonionic phases could be created in-situ within the via and adjacent extended
electrolyte through addition of SrO powder to the interconnect inks in excess of the
stoichimetric ratio of 1 mole SrO to 1 mole ZrO 2. In one form, a lower limit is
approximately 15-20 mole% SrO based on the ceramic phase, in order to form SrZrO3
to reduce YSZ below the percolation threshold. In other embodiments, other lower
limits may apply. In one form, an upper limit is about 50-60 mole% SrO based on the
ceramic phase (SrO + ZrO2). In other embodiments, other upper limits may apply.
             In yet still other embodiments, all or portions interconnect 16 or other
interconnects or vias may include a content of rare earth oxide at the stoichiometric ratio
with YSZ to lead to full reactivity to (MRE)2Zr2O7.
             Firing temperatures for using a reactant phase to form the non-ionic conducting
ceramic phases during firing of the fuel cell may vary with the needs of the particular
application. Considerations include, for example and without limitation, the sinterability
of different materials, powder particle size, specific surface area. Other material and/or
processing parameters may also affect the selected firing temperature. For example, If
the temperature is too low, the electrolyte may have higher porosity and cause leakage.
If the temperature is too high, it may cause other issues, such as too high an anode
                                                    44

density, which may reduce electrochemical activity, or may cause substrate dimensional

reactant phases to form one or more non-ionic conducting ceramic phases may vary as
between applications. In one form, the firing temperature may be 1385 0 C. In some
embodiments, the firing temperature may be in the range of 1370 0 C to 1395 0 C. In other

other embodiments, the firing temperature may be outside the range of 1350 0 C to
1450 0 C. Processing steps to form the one or more non-ionic conducting ceramic
phases may include preparing a composition including the rare earth oxide, YSZ and a
precious metal, forming the interconnect/via(s), firing the composition at the desired
temperature, e.g., at a temperature or within a temperature range set forth above, and
holding the composition at the firing temperature for a desired period, e.g., in the range
of 1-5 hours. In embodiments wherein all or portions of the fuel cell are formed by
screen printing, the method may include preparing a screen printable ink that
incorporates the rare earth oxide, YSZ and the precious metal; printing the
interconnect/via(s); drying the ink; firing the printed interconnect/via(s) at the desired
temperature, e.g., at a temperature or within a temperature range set forth above; and
holding the composition at the firing temperature for a desired period, e.g., in the range
of 1-5 hours.
             In additional embodiments, other non-ionic conducting phases or reactant
phases may be employed to minimize the ionic conductivity of the interconnect.

             Referring to FIG. 20, some aspects of a non-limiting example of an embodiment
of a fuel cell system 1510 are schematically depicted. Fuel cell system 1510 includes a
plurality of electrochemical cells 1512. In one form, electrochemical cells 1512 are solid
oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). In other embodiments, electrochemical cells 1512 may be
one or more other types of fuel cells. In one form, fuel cell system 1510 is configured as
a segmented-in-series fuel cell, that is, wherein electrochemical cells 1512 are arranged
in a segmented-in-series configuration. It will be understood not only a limited number
of electrochemical cells 1512 are illustrated, and that those to the right and to the left of
the drawing illustrated in FIG. 20 are truncated for purposes of clarity of illustration
whereas the actual number of electrochemical cells 1512 in a particular fuel cell system
1510 may be any number greater or lesser than not shown illustrated in FIG. 20.
             Electrochemical cells 1512 are supported by a porous ceramic substrate 1514.
Fuel cell system 1510 includes a plurality of interconnects 1516 that are configured to
conduct free electrons between adjacent electrochemical cells 1512. In one form, a
porous anode barrier (PAB) 1515 is disposed between electrochemical cells 1512 and
porous substrate 1514. Porous anode barrier 1515 is configured to prevent reactions
between the anodes of electrochemical cells 1512 and the porous substrate 1514.
However, porous anode barrier 1515 is not considered an active part of electrochemical
cells 1512 or fuel cell system 1510, insofar as porous anode barrier 1515 does not
provide electrical conduction within electrochemical cells 1512 or as between
electrochemical cells 1512, and does not partake in the electrochemical reactions that
generate electrical power from fuel. In other embodiments, one or more other layers in
addition to or in place of porous anode barrier 1515 may be employed. In still other
embodiments, there may be no such porous anode barrier or other layer separating
electrochemical cells 1512 from porous substrate 1514, or there may be one or more
other layers in addition to or in place of porous anode barrier 1515. An oxidant is
supplied to electrochemical cells 1512 from an oxidant side 1518. In one form, the
oxidant is air. In other embodiments other oxidants may be used in addition to or in
place of air. Fuel is supplied to electrochemical cells 1512 on a fuel side 1520 via
porous substrate 1514. In some embodiments, channels and/or other passages may be
etched or otherwise formed into porous substrate 1514 in order to facilitate the flow of
                                                50

RORO-2420                                                                   KDIM-9843732_2
fuel into electrochemical cells 1512. In one form, the fuel is combination of hydrogen,
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, steam, nitrogen and hydrocarbons of
higher molecular weight than methane. In other embodiments, other fuels may be used,
e.g. hydrogen. In addition, in other embodiments, fuel cell system 1510 and
electrochemical cells 1512 may be configured and arranged so that fuel and oxidant are
supplied from opposite or other directions than those described and illustrated herein.
             Each electrochemical cell 1512 includes an anode 1524, and electrolyte 1526
and a cathode 1528. Cathode 1528 is spaced apart from anode 1524 in a direction
1532; and electrolyte 1526 is disposed between anode 1524 and cathode 1528.
Electrochemical cells 1512 are arranged in series in a direction 1536. In the present
embodiment, each electrochemical cell 1512 also includes an anode current collector
1548 and cathode current conductor 1550. Anode current collector 1548 is electrically
coupled to anode 1524, and cathode current collector 1550 is electrically coupled to
cathode 1528. The anode and cathode current collector layers provide a higher
electrical conducutivity path for the transfer of electrons than is possible by the anode
and cathode layers themselves which are optimized for electrochemical reactions rather
than current conduction. Depending upon the embodiment, anode current collector
1548 and cathode current collector 1550 may be alternatively and respectively referred
to as anode and cathode conductive films; anode and cathode conductive layers; anode
and cathode conductor films; and/or anode and cathode conductor layers.
             In one form, fuel cell system 1510 is formed by depositing films/layers onto
porous substrate 1514, e.g., by screen printing and/or inkjet printing, to provide porous
anode barrier 1515, interconnects 1516, anodes 1524, electrolytes 1526, cathodes
1528, anode current collectors 1548 and cathode current collectors 1550. In other
embodiments, the films/layers may be deposited by one or more other techniques in
addition to or in place of screen printing and/or inkjet printing. In still other
embodiments, the aforementioned components may be thicker than what may be
known as a film, and may be deposited by the same or other means. In various
embodiments, one or more firing/sintering cycles are performed subsequent to
depositing one or more films/layers. Other embodiments may not require any
firing/sintering for one or more films/layers deposition. Examples of materials that may

RORO-2420                                                                  KDIM-9843732_2
be used to form porous substrate 1514, and materials that may be used to form the
films/layers that yield anode barrier 1515, interconnects 1516, anodes 1524, electrolytes
1526, cathodes 1528, anode current collectors 1548 and cathode current collectors
1550 are described as follows.
             In one form, porous substrate 1514 is made of MgO-MgAI2O4 (MMA). In other
embodiments, other materials may be employed in addition to or in place of MMA, for
example, doped zirconia and forsterite.
             In one form, porous anode barrier 1515 is made from an inert porous ceramic
material, e.g., a doped zirconia, such as 3YSZ. In other embodiments, other materials
may be employed, such as SrZrO3, or SrTiO3-doped zirconia composite, in addition to
or in place of doped zirconia.
             In one form, anode current collector 1548 is an electrode conductive layer formed
of a nickel cermet. Examples of suitable nickel cermets include, Ni-YSZ (yttria doping in
zirconia is 3-8 mol%,), Ni-ScSZ (scandia doping is 4-10 mol%, preferably second
doping for phase stability for 10 mol% scandia-ZrO 2) and/or Ni-doped ceria (such as Gd
or Sm doping), cermet of Ni and doped lanthanum chromite (such as Ca doping on A
site and Zn doping on B site), cermet of Ni and doped strontium titanate (such as La
doping on A site and Mn doping on B site) and/or La1.xSrxMnyCr 1.yO3. Alternatively, it is
considered that other materials for anode current collector 1548 may include cermets
based in part or whole on one or more precious metals and/or one or more precious
metal alloys in addition to retaining Ni content. Precious metals in the cermet may
include, for example, Pt, Pd, Au, Ag, and/or alloys thereof. The ceramic phase may
include, for example, an inactive non-electrically conductive phase, including, for
example, YSZ, ScSZ and/or one or more other inactive phases, e.g., having desired
coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) in order to control the CTE of the layer to match
the CTE of the substrate and electrolyte. In some embodiments, the ceramic phase
may include Al 2 O3 and/or a spinel such as NiA12 O4 , MgA12O4 , MgCr 2O4 , NiCr 2O4 . In
other embodiments, the ceramic phase may be electrically conductive, e.g., doped
lanthanum chromite, doped strontium titanate and/or one or more forms of LaSrMnCrO.

One specific example of anode current collector 1548 material is 76.5%Pd, 8.5%Ni,
15%3YSZ.
             In one form, anode 1524 may be formed of xNiO-(100-x)YSZ (x is from 55 to 75
in weight ratio), yNiO-(100-y)ScSZ (y is from 55 to 75 in weight ratio), NiO-gadolinia
stabilized ceria (such as 55wt%NiO-45wt%GDC) and/or NiO samaria stabilized ceria.
In other embodiments, other materials may be employed. For example, it is
alternatively considered that anode 1524 may be made of doped strontium titanate, Lal.
xSrxMnyCr 1-yO3                (e.g., Lao.75 Sro.25 Mno. 5Cro. 5 0 3 ) and/or other ceramic-based anode
materials.
             In one form, electrolyte 1526 is a ceramic material. For example, in some
embodiments, a proton and/or oxygen ion conducting ceramic, may be employed. In
one form, electrolyte 1526 is formed of YSZ, such as 3YSZ and/or 8YSZ. In other
embodiments, electrolyte 1526 may be formed of ScSZ, such as 4ScSZ, 6ScSz and/or
10ScSZ in addition to or in place of YSZ. In other embodiments, other materials may be
employed in addition to or in place of the aforementioned materials. For example, it is
alternatively considered that electrolyte 1526 may be made of or may include doped
ceria and/or doped lanthanum gallate. In any event, electrolyte 1526 is essentially
impervious to diffusion therethrough of the fluids used by fuel cell 10, e.g., synthesis gas
or pure hydrogen as fuel, as well as, e.g., air or 02 as an oxidant, but allows diffusion of
oxygen ions and/or protons, depending upon the particular embodiment and its
application.
             Cathode 1528 may be formed of a mixture of an electrochemically catalytic
ceramic and an ionic phase. The electrochemically catalytic phase consists of at least
one of LSM (La1.xSrxMnO 3,x=0.1 to 0.3), La1.xSrxFeO 3,(such as x=0.3), La1.xSrxCoyFel.
yO3     (such as Lao 6 Sro.4 Coo. 2 Feo8 O 3 ) and/or Pr 1.xSrxMnO 3 (such as Pro 8 Sro. 2 MnO 3 ),
although other materials may be employed without departing from the scope of the
present invention. For example, it is alternatively considered that Ruddlesden-Popper
nickelates and La1.xCaxMnO 3 (such as Lao. 8Cao. 2 MnO 3 ) materials may be employed.
The ionic phase may be YSZ containing from 3-8 mole percent yttria, or ScSZ
containing 4-10 mole percent scandia and optionally a second dopant of Al, Y or ceria at
                                                                  53

minor content (-1 mole percent) for high scandia stabilized zirconias (8-1OScSZ) to
prevent formation of the rhombohedral phase. The electrochemically catalytic ceramic
phase can comprise 40-60% by volume of the cathode.
             Cathode current collector 1550 is an electrode conductive layer formed of an
electronically conductive ceramic and in many cases is similar in its chemistry to that of
the electrochemically catalytic ceramic phase of the cathode, for example, a LSM +YSZ
cathode will generally employ a LSM (Lal-xSrxMnO3,x=O.1 to 0.3) cathode current
collector. Other embodiments of cathode current collectors may include at least one of
LaNixFe 1 .x03 (such as LaNio.6 Feo.40 3 ), La 1.xSrxMnO 3 (such as Lao.7 5 Sro.2 5MnO 3 ), doped
lanthanum chromites (such as La-xCaxCrO 3 - , x=0.15-0.3), and/or Pr1.xSrxCoO3, such
as Pro.8 Sro.2 CoO 3 . In other embodiments, cathode current collector 1550 may be
formed of other materials, e.g., a precious metal cermet, although other materials may
be employed without departing from the scope of the present invention. The precious
metals in the precious metal cermet may include, for example, Pt, Pd, Au, Ag and/or
alloys thereof. Non electrically conducting ceramic phase may also be included, for
example, YSZ, ScSZ and A120 3 , or other ceramic materials. One specific example of
cathode current collector 1550 materials is 80wt%Pd-20wt%LSM.
             An interconnect formed of a peroveskite ceramic, particularly chromite based
perovskites, may provide long-term stability in both oxidizing and reducing conditions,
and with proper doping, may exhibit satisfactory electronic conductivity at the operating
temperature of the fuel cell, e.g., with the inclusion of A-site dopants. In addition, the
conductivity of peroveskite ceramics increases with temperature, a feature which is
desirable for use in some fuel cell systems, such as solid oxide fuel cell systems.
Chromite based peroveskite ceramics require a high sintering temperature for
densification, e.g., on the order of 1750'C for undoped lanthanum chromite, and on the
order of 14500C for doped lanthanum chromite. However, it is desirable to sinter some
fuel cell system films/layers at temperatures in the range of 1350'C or lower, because
higher sintering temperatures may result in undesirable electrode or other
microstructures, and/or may result in poor fuel cell system performance.

RORO-2420                                                                   KDIM-9843732_2
             In addition, undoped lanthanum chromite has very low conductivity. In order to
achieve high conductivity, A-site dopants are needed, such as Sr, Ca and Mg cations.
However, increased A-site doping yields both a thermal expansion coefficient increase
and a chemical coefficient of expansion increase (the latter believed to originate from an
oxygen vacancy-triggered lattice expansion under a low partial-oxygen-pressure
environment) in the lanthanum chromite. The dimensional change in an interconnect
formed from such a doped lanthanum chromite may create significant local thermal
stresses in the interconnect and in other fuel cell layers, and may cause microcracks,
which may result in undesirable gas leakages.
             In the embodiment described herein, all of the fuel cell system 1510 layers are
printed on porous ceramic substrate 1514. Interconnect 1516 is disposed between the
extended anode current collector 1548 (the extended portion of anode current collector
1548 in direction 1536 beyond the bounds of anode 1524) and the extended cathode
current collector 1550 (the extended portion of cathode current collector 1550 in
direction 1536 beyond the bounds of cathode 1528) in direction 1532. Interconnect
1516 is disposed between electrolytes 1526 of adjacent electrochemical cells 1512 in
direction 1536. In the illustrated embodiment, the sintering temperature for interconnect
1516 is primarily constrained by the sintering temperature of anode 1524, anode current
collector 1548, and electrolyte 1526. The use of too high a sintering temperature for
interconnect 1516 could potentially result in: (1) undesired microstructure for anode
1524, and hence the concomitant poor fuel cell performance resulting therefrom; (2)
continued shrinkage of porous substrate 1514 during interconnect firing, which may
cause misalignment for the following layers to be printed. Densification of the porous
anode barrier may also cause high diffucional resistance for transport of fuel and
reactant products to and from the fuel cell. Severe misalignment could potentially result
in short-circuits between cells; and (3) interaction between the anode current collector
1548 and the interconnect 1516, which may form an undesirable phase at high
temperatures. Thus, in view of the above, it is desirable to avoid the use of a material
for interconnect 1516 that requires high firing/sintering temperature.
             The primary functions of an interconnect, such as interconnect 1516, is to
connect to adjacent electrochemical cells together electronically, and to separate fuel
                                                 55

and oxidant, e.g., fuel and air, by being gastight. Chromite -based peroskite materials
are desirable as interconnects given their low cost and known acceptable electrical
conductivity in the dual (oxidizing and reducing) environment experienced by the
interconnect and the satisfactory thermal and chemical expansion of this class of
material. In the illustrated embodiment, given the illustrated and described location of
interconnect 1516, it will be understood that interconnect 1516 can be printed before or
after anode 1524 or after printing of electrolyte 1526. Preferably, but not necessarily,
interconnect 1516 would be co-fired with anode current collector 1548, anode 1524, and
electrolyte 1526. It is desirable that interconnect 1516, in conjunction with electrolyte
1526, forms a gastight layer, thus preventing any commingling of fuel and oxidant.
Thus, it is desirable that not only electrolyte 1526, but also interconnect 1516, be
gastight. Accordingly, during fuel cell processing, that is, during the manufacture of fuel
cell system 1510, it is desirable that interconnect 1516 densified for gastight operation
during fuel cell system 1510 operations.
             At the same time, however, it is desirable that interconnect 1516 be chemically
compatible with anode current collector 1548, cathode current collector 1550 and
electrolyte 1526. In addition, it is desirable that no new phases be formed, during the
firing/sintering of interconnect 1516, at the interfaces between interconnect 1516, anode
current collector 1548, cathode current collector 1550 and electrolyte 1526, such as
pyrochlore, which is an insulating phase that may be formed through interaction
between lanthanum chromite and all YSZ under certain conditions. In the present
embodiment, because anode current collector 1548 and electrolyte 1526 are fired at a
relatively higher temperature in comparison to the cathode current collector 1550, an
increased likelihood of interaction between interconnect 1516 and anode current
collector 1548 and electrolyte 1526 is presented. Thus, in order to achieve a gastight
interconnect 1516; and a gastight layer formed by interconnect 1516 and electrolyte
1526; and to electronically connect adjacent electrochemical cells 1512; without forming
an undesirable phase at any of the interfaces with interconnect 1516; and without
forming microcracks in interconnect 1516 or any other layer that may otherwise result
from thermal and chemical expansion of interconnect 1516, it is desirable to achieve
satisfactory densification and gas-tightness of the interconnect 1516 comprised of
                                                  56

doped lanthanum chromite at a firing temperature that is compatible with the firing of the
other layers comprising the fuel cell. The challenge is that the desired densification can
not be achieved for chromite-based perovskites when sintering under constrained
condition and normal fuel cell processing temperatures.
             Accordingly, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention,
interconnect 1516 is formed of a pre-mixed ceramic/metal composite formulation that is
printed (deposited) as a single film/layer and then sintered. In one form, the single layer
formed by the sintered pre-mixed ceramic/metal composite is solely what forms
interconnect 1516. In other embodiments, interconnect 1516 may be formed by more
than one layer of the pre-mixed ceramic/metal composite, and/or may incorporate one
or more other films/layers, components and/or features.       In various embodiments,
interconnect 1516 is formed of a ceramic/metal composite having an electronically
conductive ceramic phase, referred to herein as a conductive ceramic or a conductive
ceramic phase, and a metallic phase in the form of one or more precious metals and/or
one or more precious metal alloys. In some embodiments, the metallic phase may also
include non-precious metals, such as Cu, to aid in densification of the composite
formulation and/or wetting of the ceramic phase to facilitate infusion into the conductive
ceramic. Compositional levels of the non-precious metals are such that they remain in
the molten alloy rather than oxidizing at the firing temperatures of the fuel cell. It will be
understood that the term, "pre-mixed ceramic/metal composite," refers to the ceramic
phase and the metallic phase being mixed together prior to firing/sintering, whereby the
firing/sintering process transforms the combination of the ceramic phase and the
metallic phase into a unitary ceramic/metal composite material. As used herein with
respect to fuel cell system 1510, the terms "sintering," "firing," "firing/sintering" and the
like are synonymous, and when used with respect to interconnects 1516 refer to heating
to a temperature sufficient to both densify the ceramic phase and melt the metallic
phase. The conductive ceramic phase is less than 100v%, and is equal to or greater
than approximately 70v%. In one form, the metallic phase is less than 30v%, and exists
as isolated phase that fills pore spaces within the conductive ceramic phase. As such,
the metallic phase generally does not contribute much, if any, to the conductivity of
interconnect 1516 if metallic content is much lower than the percolation point, -30v%.

Besides, in this embodiment, the current flow through the thin interconnect film takes
place without in-plane conduction. Low interconnect ASR can be achieved with
reasonable conductivity. For example, if the conductivity of the conductive ceramic is 1
S/cm and the thickness of the interconnect layer is 20 microns, the theoretical ASR
contribution from the interconnect is 0.002 ohm-cmA2, which meets the performance
target for most fuel cell systems. In some cases, the metallic phase can be up to 30v%
to reach percolation for higher conductivity to meet fuel cell system performance
requirement.
             In one form, the conductive ceramic phase is in the range of approximately 80
99v%; and the metallic phase in the form of one or more precious metals and/or one or
more precious metal alloys in the range of approximately 1-20v%. In other
embodiments, the conductive ceramic phase v% and the metallic phase v% may be
outside these ranges. Although any precious metal may be used, depending on the
sintering temperature constraints and/or other factors, precious metals currently
contemplated include precious metal alloys that will melt at desired firing temperatures,
for example and without limitation, Ag-Pd, Ag-Pt, Au-Pd, and Au-Pt, and/or other binary
systems, and/or ternary systems and/or quaternary systems employing only the
precious metals. In some embodiments, other metals, such as Cu, may be combined
with the precious metal and/or precious metal alloy in order to enhance the diffusion
between the liquid and solid phases during sintering, thus improving the densification of
the ceramic-metal composite.
             In one form, the conductive ceramic phase is a doped lanthanum chromite of the
form (La1.xAx)(Cr 1 .yBy)O 3, wherein A is an alkaline earth metal, such as Ca or Sr; B is a
transition metal, or at least one of the transition metals, such as Mn, V, Ti, Fe, Co, Ni,
Cu, Zn; 0 < x < 0.4; and 0 < y < 0.5 depending on the doping elements. For La1 .xSxCr1 .
yMnyO 3 (LSCM),                    y can be up to 0.5.
             In other embodiments, the conductive ceramic phase may employ other
conductive ceramics in addition to or in place of doped lanthanum chromite. For
example, other embodiments contemplate the use of doped strontium titanate and/or
doped yttrium chromite to form all or part of the conductive ceramic phase. Doped
strontium titanate may be of the form (Sr1 .xAx)(Ti 1 yBy)O 3 , wherein A is a rare earth
                                                       58

to 0.4, and y can be up to 0.5. Doped yttrium chromites may take the form (Y1.xAx)(Cr 1 .
yBy)O      3 , wherein A is an alkaline earth metal, such as Ca, Sr; B is transition metal, or at
least one of the transition metals, such as Mn, V, Ti, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn; 0 < x < 0.4; and
0 < y : 0.5 depending on the doping elements. For La1 .xSxCr1 .yMnyO 3 (LSCM), y can be
up to 0.5.
              In one form, the conductive ceramic phase is provided in the form of a conductive
ceramic powder having a particle size in the range of 0.04 to 2.0 microns, preferably
from 0.1 to 1.0 microns, uniformly dispersed in a solvent with the polymer, such as
terpineol, to form a printable paste. In other embodiments, the conductive ceramic
phase may be provided in one or more other forms. In one form, the metal phase is in
the form of powdered precious metal and/or print precious metal alloy having a particle
size in the range of 0.05 to 3.0 microns, and uniformly dispersed in the solvent with the
ceramic phase and polymer, such as terpineol, to form a printable paste. In other
embodiments, the metallic phase may be provided in one or more other forms. In order
to form interconnect 1516, the paste dispersed with the particles of the metallic and
conductive ceramic phases is first printed/deposited onto the appropriate location of
each electrochemical cell 1512, and then interconnect 1516 is fired/sintered.
             The precious metal and or precious metal alloy phase has a lower melting point
than the conductive ceramic phase, and can form a liquid phase during the
firing/sintering of the interconnect 1516. The capillary force of the liquid phase is
believed to pull ceramic particles together for microstructural rearrangement to achieve
better densification. In addition, by selecting one or more desired binary systems, for
example and without limitation, Ag-Pd, Ag-Pt, Au-Pd, Au-Pt and Pd-Pt; and/or one or
more ternary systems employing only the precious metals, for example and without
limitation, Ag-Pd-Pt, Au-Pt-Au, etc.; and/or one or more quaternary systems employing
only the precious metals, e.g., Ag-Pd-Pt-Au, etc.; the temperature of the liquid metal
phase formation may be controlled, e.g., thereby controlling the degree to which the
metallic phase flows into the pores of the conductive ceramic phase. In some
                                                   59

RORO-2420                                                                  KDIM-9843732_2
embodiments, non-precious metal, such as Cu be alloyed and/or mixed (e.g., a mixture
of metallic powders) with one of the precious metals and/or precious metal alloys to
enhance the diffusion between the liquid and solid phases during sintering, thus
improving the densification of the ceramic-metal composite. The metallic phase, acting
as a filler, filling up what would otherwise be open pores in the ceramic phase, e.g. in
the doped lanthanum chromite, can improve the densification of interconnect 1516, and
hence rendering a more gastight interconnect 1516 having a porosity of approximately
5% or less.
             In addition, the ceramic/metal composite interconnect has a lower Young's
modulus than doped lanthanum chromite, and may significantly reduce thermal stress in
the fuel cell layers during fuel cell manufacturing, testing and normal operation.
Although conventional doped lanthanum chromite exhibits isothermal expansion during
fuel cell processing and/or operating conditions of up to 0.3-0.4%, as opposed to
generally accepted interconnect dimensional change limits in a fuel cell stack of less
than 0.1%, interconnect 1516 is relatively soft due to the inclusion of the precious
metal(s) and/or alloys, which may significantly reduce the thermal stress resulting from
interconnect dimensional change, and prevent microcracks in fuel cell layers. In view of
the above, it is seen that an interconnect formed of a ceramic/metal composite having a
conductive ceramic phase mixed with a metallic phase, as described herein, may aid in
the sintering of the interconnect, fill pores in the doped lanthanum chromite to achieve a
dense interconnect layer, and function as an energy absorber to reduce thermal stress
resulting from isothermal expansion of doped lanthanum chromite under reducing
atmosphere conditions. In addition, the metallic phase may also help to improve
composite interconnect conductivity in embodiments where such is desired, in
particular, by selecting a metallic phase content in the range of approximately 30% by
volume or more. Since the primary interconnect of a segmented-in-series cell design is
thin and small, usually a very narrow strip, the performance/cost ratio may thus be
improved with the further addition of a small amount of metallic phase in interconnect
1516, e.g., beyond 1-20v%, as needed to reach a metallic phase content of interconnect
1516 in the range of approximately 30% by volume or more.

             In the embodiments of FIG. 20, various features, components and
interrelationships therebetween of aspects of embodiments of the present invention are
depicted. However, the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiments of
FIG. 20 and the components, features and interrelationships therebetween as are
illustrated in FIG. 20 and described herein.
             Referring to FIG. 21, a fuel cell system 1610 is illustrated. Fuel cell system 1610
is the baseline fuel cell system configuration that serves as a backdrop against which
the fuel cell systems 1710, 1810, 1910 and 2010 of FIGS. 22-25 may be compared.
Many common components are shared in common as between fuel cell systems 1610,
1710, 1810, 1910 and 2010, and hence, the same reference characters (numbers) are
employed in describing the same fuel cell system components illustrated in FIGS. 21
25, notwithstanding that some components, such as one or more porous anode barriers
may or may not be segmented in the various embodiments. Each of fuel cell systems
1610, 1710, 1810, 1910 and 2010 employ an external reformer (not shown) to reform
the hydrocarbon feed, e.g., a steam reformer and/or any other suitable reformer-type, to
generate the hydrocarbon-sourced syngas that functions as a fuel in the
electrochemical cells of these fuel cell systems. Although it may be possible to perform
partial or complete on-cell reforming, i.e., reforming that is performed within the fuel cell
stack, there are certain dangers and/or other adverse effects associated with on-cell
reforming, rendering on-cell reforming undesirable, and which are preferably and should
be avoided by the use of external reforming to sufficiently reform the hydrocarbon feed
and essentially prevent and eliminate the possibility of on-cell reforming.
             Fuel cell system 1610 includes a plurality of electrochemical cells 1612. In one
form, electrochemical cells 1612 are solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). In other
embodiments, electrochemical cells 1612 may be one or more other types of fuel cells.
In one form, fuel cell system 1610 is configured as a segmented-in-series fuel cell, that
is, wherein electrochemical cells 1612 are arranged in a segmented-in-series
configuration. It will be understood not only a limited number of electrochemical cells
1612 are illustrated, and that those to the right and to the left of the drawing illustrated in
FIG. 21 are truncated for purposes of clarity of illustration, whereas the actual number of
                                                    61

electrochemical cells 1612 in a particular fuel cell system 1610 may be any number
greater or lesser than that illustrated in FIG. 21.
             Electrochemical cells 1612 are supported by a porous ceramic substrate 1614.
Fuel cell system 1610 includes a plurality of interconnects 1616 that are configured to
conduct free electrons between adjacent electrochemical cells 1612. In one form, a
porous anode barrier (PAB) 1615 is disposed between electrochemical cells 1612 and
porous substrate 1614. Porous anode barrier 1615 is configured to prevent reactions
between the anodes of electrochemical cells 1612 and the porous substrate 1614,
and/or the anode current collectors and the porous substrate 1614. However, porous
anode barrier 1615 is not considered an active part of electrochemical cells 1612 or fuel
cell system 1610, insofar as porous anode barrier 1615 does not provide electrical
conduction within electrochemical cells 1612 or as between electrochemical cells 1612,
and does not partake in the electrochemical reactions that generate electrical power
from fuel. In other embodiments, one or more other layers in addition to or in place of
porous anode barrier 1615 may be employed. In still other embodiments, there may be
no such porous anode barrier or other layer separating electrochemical cells 1612 from
porous substrate 1614, or there may be one or more other layers in addition to or in
place of porous anode barrier 1615. An oxidant is supplied to electrochemical cells
1612 from an oxidant side 1618. In one form, the oxidant is air. In other embodiments
other oxidants may be used in addition to or in place of air. Fuel is supplied to
electrochemical cells 1612 on a fuel side 1620 via porous substrate 1614. In some
embodiments, channels and/or other passages may be etched or otherwise formed into
porous substrate 1614 in order to facilitate the flow of fuel into electrochemical cells
1612. In one form, the fuel is syngas. In other embodiments, other fuels may be used,
e.g. hydrogen. In addition, in other embodiments, fuel cell system 1610 and
electrochemical cells 1612 may be configured and arranged so that fuel and oxidant are
supplied from opposite or other directions than those described and illustrated herein.
             Each electrochemical cell 1612 includes an anode 1624, and electrolyte 1626
and a cathode 1628. Cathode 1628 is spaced apart from anode 1624 in a vertical
direction 1632; and electrolyte 1626 is disposed between anode 1624 and cathode
1628. Electrolyte 1626 is in contact with both an anode 1624 and cathode 1628 for
                                                 62

performing electrochemical reactions within each electrochemical cell 1612.
Electrochemical cells 1612 are arranged in series in a horizontal direction 1636.
Although the present fuel cells described using vertical direction 1632 and horizontal
direction 1636, it will be understood that these directions are illustrative only, and that
other fuel cell orientations may be employed, which may employ other directional axes
in addition to or in place of direction 1632 and direction 1636.
             Each electrochemical cell 1612 also includes an anode current collector 1648
and cathode current conductor 1650. Anode current collector 1648 is electrically
coupled to and in contact with anode 1624, and cathode current collector 1650 is
electrically coupled to and in contact with cathode 1628. Depending upon the
embodiment, anode current collector 1648 and cathode current collector 1650 may be
alternatively and respectively referred to as anode and cathode conductive films; anode
and cathode conductive layers; anode and cathode conductor films; and/or anode and
cathode conductor layers. Interconnects 1616 electrically couple anode current
collectors 1648 and cathode current collectors 1650 of adjacent cells for the
transmission of electric current. The porosity of each of porous substrate 1614, porous
anode barrier 1615 and anode current collector 1648 are configured to supply anode
1624 with fuel from fuel side 1620. Thus, anode 1624 receives fuel via porous
substrate 1614, porous anode barrier 1615 and anode current collector 1648.
             Fuel cell system 1610 also includes a ceramic seal 1602. In one form, a plurality
of ceramic seals 1602 are applied on top of porous anode barrier 1615. Ceramic seals
1602 are positioned horizontally in direction 1636 between the anode current collectors
1648 of an adjacent electrochemical cells 1612. In other embodiments, ceramic seal
1602 may be located in other orientations and locations. Ceramic seal 1602 has a
thickness, i.e., as measured in vertical direction 1632, of approximately 5-30 microns,
although other thickness values may be employed in other embodiments. In one form,
ceramic seal 1602 is impervious to gases and liquids, such as the fuel and oxidants
employed by electrochemical cells 1612, and is configured to prevent the leakage of
gases and liquids from substrate porous anode barrier 1615 in those areas where it is
applied. In other embodiments, ceramic seal 1602 may be substantially impervious to
gases and liquids, and may be configured to reduce leakage of gases and liquids from
                                                 63

porous anode barrier 1615 in those areas where it is applied, e.g., relative to other
configurations that do not employ a ceramic seal. Ceramic seal 1602 is configured to
provide an essentially "gas-tight" seal between porous anode barrier 1615 and fuel cell
components disposed on the side of ceramic seal 1602 opposite of that of porous
anode barrier 1615.
             Ceramic seal 1602 is formed from a ceramic material. In one form, the ceramic
material used to form ceramic seal 1602 is yittria stabilized zirconia, such as 3YSZ. In
some embodiments, the material used to form ceramic seal 1602 may be scandia
stabilized zirconia, such as 4ScSZ. In other embodiments, the material used to form
ceramic seal 1602 may be alumina. In still other embodiments, the material used to
form 1602 seal 102 may be non-conductive pyrochlore materials, such as La2 Zr 2 O7 .
Other embodiments may employ other ceramics, e.g., depending upon various factors,
such as compatibility with the materials of adjacent portions of each electrochemical cell
1612 and porous anode barrier 1615, the fuels and oxidants employed by fuel cell
system 1610, and the local transient and steady-state operating temperatures of fuel
cell system 1610. Still other embodiments may employ materials other than ceramics.
In some embodiments, such as those described and illustrated with respect to FIG. 25,
ceramic seal 1602 may just be disposed adjacent to that is on top of, in vertical direction
1632, substrate 1614.
             In one form, fuel cell system 1610 is formed by depositing films/layers onto
porous substrate 1614, e.g., by screen printing and/or inkjet printing, to provide porous
anode barrier 1615, interconnects 1616, anodes 1624, electrolytes 1626, cathodes
1628, anode current collectors 1648 and cathode current collectors 1650. In other
embodiments, the films/layers may be deposited by one or more other techniques in
addition to or in place of screen printing and/or inkjet printing. In still other
embodiments, the aforementioned components may be thicker than what may be
known as a film, and may be deposited by the same or other means. In various
embodiments, one or more firing/sintering cycles are performed subsequent to
depositing one or more films/layers. Other embodiments may not require any
firing/sintering for one or more films/layers. Examples of materials that may be used to
form porous substrate 1614, and materials that may be used to form the films/layers

that yield anode barrier 1615, interconnects 1616, anodes 1624, electrolytes 1626,
cathodes 1628, anode current collectors 1648 and cathode current collectors 1650 are
described as follows.
             In one form, porous substrate 1614 is made of MgO-MgAI2O4 (MMA). In other
embodiments, other materials may be employed in addition to or in place of MMA, such
as doped zirconia.
             In one form, porous anode barrier 1615 is made from an inert porous ceramic
material, e.g., a doped zirconia, such as 3YSZ. In other embodiments, other materials
may be employed, such as SrZrO3, or SrTiO3-doped zirconia composite. Porous
anode barrier 1615 is configured to prevent NiO in anode 1624 and Ni or Ni-containing
compounds in anode current collector 1648 from interacting with MgO in porous
substrate 1614.
             In one form, anode current collector 1648 is an electrode conductive layer formed
of a nickel cermet. Examples of suitable nickel cermets include, Ni-YSZ (yttria doping in
zirconia is 3-8 mol%,), Ni-ScSZ (scandia doping is 4-10 mol%, preferably second
doping for phase stability for 10 mol% scandia-ZrO 2) and/or Ni-doped ceria (such as Gd
or Sm doping), Ni plus doped lanthanum chromite (such as Ca doping on A site and Zn
doping on B site), Ni plus doped strontium titanate (such as La doping on A site and Mn
doping on B site) and/or Ni lus La1.xSrxMnyCr 1.yO3. Alternatively, it is considered that
other materials for anode current collector 1648 may include cermets based in part or
whole on one or more precious metals and/or one or more precious metal alloys.
Precious metals in the cermet may include, for example, Pt, Pd, Au, Ag, and/or alloys
thereof. The ceramic phase may include, for example, an inactive non-electrically
conductive phase, including, for example, YSZ, ScSZ and/or one or more other inactive
phases, e.g., having desired coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) in order to control
the CTE of the layer to match the CTE of the substrate and electrolyte. In some
embodiments, the ceramic phase may include A12 0 3 and/or a spinel such as NiA12 O4 ,
MgA12 O4 , MgCr 2O4 , NiCr 2O4 . In other embodiments, the ceramic phase may be
electrically conductive, e.g., doped lanthanum chromite, doped strontium titanate and/or

one or more forms of LaSrMnCrO. One specific example of anode current collector
1648 material is 76.5%Pd, 8.5%Ni, 15%3YSZ.
             In one form, anode 1624 may be formed of xNiO-(100-x)YSZ (x is from 55 to 75
in weight ratio), yNiO-(100-y)ScSZ (y is from 55 to 75 in weight ratio), NiO-gadolinia
stabilized ceria (such as 55wt%NiO-45wt%GDC) and/or NiO samaria stabilized ceria.
In other embodiments, other materials may be employed. For example, it is
alternatively considered that anode 1624 may be made of doped strontium titanate
and/or La 1 .xSrxMnyCr1 .yO3 (e.g., Lao.75 Sro. 25Mno.5 Cro. 5 0 3 ).
             In one form, electrolyte 1626 is a ceramic material. For example, in some
embodiments, a proton and/or oxygen ion conducting ceramic, may be employed. In
one form, electrolyte 1626 is formed of YSZ, such as 3YSZ and/or 8YSZ. In other
embodiments, electrolyte 1626 may be formed of ScSZ, such as 4ScSZ, 6ScSz and/or
10ScSZ in addition to or in place of YSZ. In other embodiments, other materials may be
employed in addition to or in place of the aforementioned materials. For example, it is
alternatively considered that electrolyte 1626 may be made of or may include doped
ceria and/or doped lanthanum gallate. In any event, electrolyte 1626 is essentially
impervious to diffusion therethrough of the fluids used by fuel cell 10, e.g., synthesis gas
or pure hydrogen as fuel, as well as, e.g., air or 02 as an oxidant, but allows diffusion of
oxygen ions and/or protons, depending upon the particular embodiment and its
application.
             Cathode 1628 may be formed of at least one of LSM (La 1 .xSrxMnO 3,x=O.1 to 0.3),

employed without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, it is
alternatively considered that Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates and La 1 .xCaxMnO 3 (such as
Lao.8 Cao. 2 MnO 3 ) materials may be employed.
             Cathode current collector 1650 is an electrode conductive layer formed of an

other embodiments, cathode current collector 1650 may be formed of other materials,
e.g., a precious metal cermet, although other materials may be employed without
departing from the scope of the present invention. The precious metals in the precious
metal cermet may include, for example, Pt, Pd, Au, Ag and/or alloys thereof. The
ceramic phase may include, for example, YSZ, ScSZ and A12 0 3 , or other ceramic
materials. One specific example of cathode current collector 1650 materials is
80wt%Pd-20wt%LSM.
             Interconnect 1616 may be formed in the same manner and using the same
materials as one or more of the interconnects previously described herein, such as, for
example that described with respect to interconnect 16, including blind primary
conductor 52, auxiliary conductor 54, and/or auxiliary conductor 56; and interconnect
1516.
             It has been found that during certain operating conditions, e.g., at high fuel
utilization levels, severe Ni coarsening may occur in anode 1624, and Ni coarsening
and/or Ni material loss may also occur in anode current collector 1648.              It is believed
that the mechanism that causes the coarsening include a high steam concentration, and
the presence of fine Ni and ceramic particles in anode 1624 and anode current collector
1648. The steam concentration, which can reach as high as 50% by volume, includes
steam that is supplied as part of the syngas used as a fuel for fuel cell system 1610,
and steam generated at the interface between anode 1624 and electrolyte 1626. Under
such a high steam content, the Ni(OH) 2 vapor pressure is high, especially for fine Ni
particles; and Ni loss through Ni(OH) 2 vapor phase migration is unavoidable                    The
mechanism for Ni loss is believed to be that set forth by Equation 1:
             Ni(s) + H20(g) = Ni(OH) 2 (g)                                   Equation 1
             Equation 1 illustrates that the solid Ni material is reacted into the gaseous form
and then migrates from locations in anode 1624 and/or anode current collector 1648,
and is deposited in other locations, resulting in undesirable Ni coarsening or loss in the
active anode layer, which reduces the efficiency of both anode 1624 and anode current
collector 1648. This invention is to provide sacrificial Ni upstream of anode 1624 and
anode current collector 1648, so that during the high fuel utilization conditions, the
                                                   67

sacrificial Ni will react with steam to form the Ni hydroxide vapor phase, Ni(OH) 2(g), and
saturate the fuel gas with the Ni hydroxide vapor phase, thereby reducing the reaction
of steam with the active anode layers, i.e., anode 1624 and anode current collector
1648.         Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention employ a modified porous
anode barrier that includes additional Ni in order to protect anode 1624 and anode
current collector 1648. This approach is for fuel compositions in which the complete
reforming reaction to form the syngas, e.g., steam reforming, is achieved outside of the
fuel cell stack, in an external reforming process. These sacrificial nickel layers are not
intended to and essentially do not contribute to reforming or further reforming of natural
gas or other hydrocarbon feeds, i.e., contribute to essentially no on-cell reforming.
             Referring to FIG. 22, some aspects of a non-limiting example of a fuel cell
system            1710 in accordance with    an embodiment of the        present invention is
schematically depicted. Fuel cell system 1710 includes a plurality of electrochemical
cells 1712. In one form, electrochemical cells 1712 are solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).
In other embodiments, electrochemical cells 1712 may be one or more other types of
fuel cells. In one form, fuel cell system 1710 is configured as a segmented-in-series
fuel cell, that is, wherein electrochemical cells 1712 are arranged in a segmented-in
series configuration. It will be understood not only a limited number of electrochemical
cells 1712 are illustrated, and that those to the right and to the left of the drawing
illustrated in FIG. 22 are truncated for purposes of clarity of illustration, whereas the
actual number of electrochemical cells 1712 in a particular fuel cell system 1710 may be
any number greater or lesser than that illustrated in FIG. 22.
             Electrochemical cells 1712 are spaced apart in direction 1636, and are supported
by porous ceramic substrate 1614. Fuel cell system 1710 includes a plurality of
interconnects 1616 that are configured to conduct free electrons between adjacent
electrochemical cells 1712. As with fuel cell system 1610, each electrochemical cell
1712 includes an anode 1624, and electrolyte 1626, a cathode 1628, an anode current
collector 1648 and a cathode current collector 1650, each of which are arranged as set
forth above with respect to electrochemical cells 1612. Interconnect 1616 couples the
anode current collector 1648 and cathode current collector 1650 of adjacent cells to
transmit current from one electrochemical cell 1712 to the next adjacent electrochemical
                                                68

cell 1712. Anode current collector 1648 includes a portion that is vertically disposed
between anode 1624 and the porous anode barrier 1617, described below. Fuel cell
system 1710 also includes a ceramic seal 1602 disposed adjacent to each of both sides
of the portion of each anode current collector 1648 that is vertically below anodes 1624
in direction 1632. Ceramic seals 1602 thus prevent fuel from flowing into
electrochemical cells 1712 except that portion which is directly below anodes 1624 in
direction 1632. The materials used to form ceramic seal 1602, porous ceramic
substrate 1614, interconnect 1616, anode 1624, electrolyte 1626, cathode 1628, anode
current collector 1648 and cathode current collector 1650 are the same as those set
forth above with respect to FIG. 21.
             An oxidant is supplied to electrochemical cells 1712 from an oxidant side 1618.
In one form, the oxidant is air. In other embodiments other oxidants may be used in
addition to or in place of air. Fuel is supplied to electrochemical cells 1712 on a fuel
side 1620 via porous substrate 1614. In some embodiments, channels and/or other
passages may be etched or otherwise formed into porous substrate 1614 in order to
facilitate the flow of fuel into electrochemical cells 1712. In one form, the fuel is syngas.
In other embodiments, other fuels may be used, e.g. hydrogen. In addition, in other
embodiments, fuel cell system 1710 and electrochemical cells 1712 may be configured
and arranged so that fuel and oxidant are supplied from opposite or other directions
than those described and illustrated herein.
             Fuel cell system 1710 includes a porous anode barrier (PAB) 1617. Porous
anode barrier 1617 is disposed between e have a better matched CTE with the
substrate ectrochemical cells 1712 and porous substrate 1614. Porous anode barrier
1617 is configured to prevent reactions between the anodes of electrochemical cells
1712 and the porous substrate 1614, and/or the anode current collectors and the
porous substrate 1614. In addition, porous anode barrier 1617 is configured to provide
sacrificial Ni upstream of anode 1624 and anode current collector 1648, so that during
the high fuel utilization conditions, the sacrificial Ni in porous anode barrier 1617 will
react with steam to form the Ni hydroxide vapor phase, Ni(OH) 2(g), and saturate the fuel
gas supplied via porous substrate 1614 with the Ni hydroxide vapor phase, thereby
reducing the reaction of the steam with the active anode layers, i.e., anode 1624 and
                                                 69

anode current collector 1648. However, porous anode barrier 1617 is not considered
an active part of electrochemical cells 1712 or fuel cell system 1710, insofar as porous
anode barrier 1617 does not provide electrical conduction within electrochemical cells
1712 or as between electrochemical cells 1712, and does not partake in the
electrochemical reactions that generate electrical power from fuel within electrochemical
cells 1712 and fuel cell system 1710. In other embodiments, one or more other layers
in addition to or in place of porous anode barrier 1617 may be employed. In still other
embodiments, there may be one or more other layers in addition to or in place of porous
anode barrier 1617.
             In one form, porous anode barrier 1617 is made from a NiO-YSZ mixture. The
NiO content is relatively low, compared to anode 1624, and is about 10-30% by weight
of porous anode barrier 1617. The NiO provides Ni for reaction with steam to form the
desired Ni hydroxide vapor phase, Ni(OH) 2 (g), for the aforementioned protection of
anode 1624 and anode current collector 1648. Although higher concentrations of NiO
may provide higher levels of protection, undesirable results would be obtained if the NiO
concentration was at or above the percolation threshold, which is approximately 30% Ni
metal by volume after reduction.           By keeping the NiO concentration below the
percolation threshold, porous anode barrier 1617 remains as an insulating phase or has
very high electrical resistance, thereby avoiding a short-circuit between adjacent
electrochemical cells 1712 through porous anode barrier 1617. In some embodiments,
porous anode barrier 1617 is made from a mixture of NiO and La2 Zr 2 O7 . La 2 Zr 2 O7 has a
slightly lower coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) than YSZ. By carefully controlling
the NiO content in the mixture, a well matched CTE with the substrate can be achieved.

             Electrochemical cells 1812 are spaced apart in direction 1636, and are supported
by porous ceramic substrate 1614. Fuel cell system 1810 includes a porous anode
barrier 1615 disposed between electrochemical cells 1812 and porous ceramic
substrate 1614. Porous anode barrier 1615 may be the same as that described above
with respect to fuel cell system 1610 and FIG. 21. Fuel cell system 1810 includes a
plurality of interconnects 1616 that are configured to conduct free electrons between
adjacent electrochemical cells 1812. As with fuel cell system 1610, each
electrochemical cell 1812 includes an anode 1624, and electrolyte 1626, a cathode
1628, an anode current collector 1648 and a cathode current collector 1650, each of
which are arranged as set forth above with respect to electrochemical cells 1612.
Interconnect 1616 couples the anode current collector 1648 and cathode current
collector 1650 of adjacent cells to transmit current from one electrochemical cell 1812 to
the next adjacent electrochemical cell 1812. Fuel cell system 1810 also includes a
ceramic seals 1602. The materials used to form ceramic seal 1602, porous ceramic
substrate 1614, interconnect 1616, anode 1624, electrolyte 1626, cathode 1628, anode
current collector 1648 and cathode current collector 1650 are the same as those set

             Fuel cell system 1810 includes a porous anode barrier (PAB) 1617. Porous
anode barrier 1617 is disposed vertically in direction 1632 between electrochemical
cells 1812 and porous substrate 1614. Porous anode barrier 1617 is provided in
segments having the same width as anode 1624, and are disposed below anodes 1624
in direction 1632. Ceramic seals 1602 are disposed between each segment of porous
anode barrier 1617 such that there is a ceramic seal 1602 disposed horizontally
adjacent to each of both sides of the porous anode barrier 1617 segment of each
electrochemical cell 1812. In fuel cell system 1810, porous anode barrier 1615 is
continuous, extending along substrate 1614 in direction 1636, and is positioned on top
of substrate 1614, and below ceramic seals 1602 and porous anode barrier 1617
segments. Porous anode barrier 1615 is configured to provide a smooth surface for the
deposition of other layers, in order to avoid mechanical defects and provide a
continuous insulating layer to prevent short circuits between two adjacent cells. Porous
anode barrier 1617 is configured to provide sacrificial Ni upstream of anode 1624 and
anode current collector 1648, so that during the high fuel utilization conditions, the
sacrificial Ni in porous anode barrier 1617 will react with steam to form the Ni hydroxide
vapor phase, Ni(OH) 2(g), and saturate the fuel gas supplied via porous substrate 1614
with the Ni hydroxide vapor phase, thereby reducing in the reaction of the steam with
the active anode layers, i.e., anode 1624 and anode current collector 1648. Since
porous anode barrier 1617 is deposited on top of porous anode barrier 1615, a higher
amount of sacrificial NiO can be added into porous anode barrier 1617 without risking
short circuits between two adjacent cells. However, porous anode barrier 1617 is not
considered an active part of electrochemical cells 1812 or fuel cell system 1810, insofar
as porous anode barrier 1617 does not provide electrical conduction within

             In one form, porous anode barrier 1617 is made from a mixture of NiO-YSZ. The
NiO content may vary with the needs of the application. In one form, the NiO content
may be approximately in the range from 10 to 75wt%. In some embodiments, the NiO
content may be in the range of approximately 20 to 50wt% in order to obtain a better
matched CTE with the substrate. In some embodiments, porous anode barrier 1617
may be made from mixture of NiO and La2 Zr 2 O7 . The NiO provides Ni for reaction with
steam to form the desired Ni hydroxide vapor phase, Ni(OH) 2 (g), for the aforementioned
protection of anode 1624 and anode current collector 1648. Higher concentrations of
NiO may be employed relative to the embodiment of FIG. 22, since there is no direct
current flow path between adjacent electrochemical cells through porous anode barrier
1617, since it is bound on both sides by ceramic seals 1602. Current will also not flow
through porous anode barrier 1615, because the NiO content is below the percolation
threshold. In some embodiments, porous anode barrier 1615 is purposely configured to
have little or no NiO.             Greater protection against anode 1624 and anode current
collector 1648 Ni migration may be thus be obtained due to the higher allowable NiO
concentration in porous anode barrier 1617 in the embodiment of fuel cell system 1810
and FIG. 23, relative to that of fuel cell system 1710 and FIG. 22.

porous anode barrier 1617 segments is the same as that of anode 1624. In other
embodiments other sizes may be employed. In one form, porous anode barrier 1617
segments are positioned vertically below anode 1624 in direction 1632, whereas porous
anode barrier segments 1615 are not so positioned. Porous anode barrier 1615 and
porous anode barrier 1617 are disposed between electrochemical cells 1912 and
porous substrate 1614. Porous anode barrier 1617 is configured to prevent reactions
between the anodes of electrochemical cells 1912 and the porous substrate 1614,
and/or the anode current collectors and the porous substrate 1614. In addition, porous
anode barrier 1617 is configured to provide sacrificial Ni upstream of anode 1624 and
anode current collector 1648, so that during the high fuel utilization conditions, the
sacrificial Ni in porous anode barrier 1617 will react with steam to form the Ni hydroxide
vapor phase, Ni(OH) 2(g), and saturate the fuel gas supplied via porous substrate 1614
with the Ni hydroxide vapor phase, thereby reducing in the reaction of the steam with
the active anode layers, i.e., anode 1624 and anode current collector 1648. However,
porous anode barrier 1617 is not considered an active part of electrochemical cells
1912 or fuel cell system 1910, insofar as porous anode barrier 1617 does not provide
electrical conduction within electrochemical cells 1912 or as between electrochemical
cells 1912, and does not partake in the electrochemical reactions that generate
electrical power from fuel within electrochemical cells 1912 and fuel cell system 1910.
In other embodiments, one or more other layers in addition to or in place of porous
anode barrier 1617 may be employed. In still other embodiments, there may be one or
more other layers in addition to or in place of porous anode barrier 1617.
             In one form, porous anode barrier 1617 is made from a mixture of NiO-YSZ. The
NiO content may vary with the needs of the application. In one form, the NiO content
may be approximately in the range from 10 to 75wt%. In some embodiments, the NiO
content may be in the range of approximately 20 to 50wt% in order to obtain a better
matched CTE with the substrate. In some embodiments, porous anode barrier 1617
may be made from mixture of NiO and La2 Zr 2 O7 . The NiO provides Ni for reaction with
steam to form the desired Ni hydroxide vapor phase, Ni(OH) 2 (g), for the aforementioned
protection of anode 1624 and anode current collector 1648. Higher concentrations of
NiO may be employed relative to the embodiment of FIG. 22, since there is no direct
                                                75

current flow path between adjacent electrochemical cells through porous anode barrier
1617, since it is bound on both sides by porous anode barrier 1615. Current will not flow
through porous anode barrier 1615, because the NiO content is below the percolation
threshold. In some embodiments, porous anode barrier 1615 is purposely configured to
have little or no NiO.             Greater protection against anode 1624 and anode current
collector 1648 Ni migration may be thus be obtained due to the higher allowable NiO
concentration in porous anode barrier 1617 in the embodiment of fuel cell system 1910
and FIG. 24, relative to that of fuel cell system 1710 and FIG. 22.           Because porous
anode barrier layers are sicker then ceramic seal layers, the embodiment of FIG. 24
may keep the surface upon which the electrochemical cells will be printed flatter than in
the embodiment of FIG. 23.
             Referring to FIG. 25, some aspects of a non-limiting example of a fuel cell
system 2010 in accordance with                 an embodiment of the      present invention is
schematically depicted. Fuel cell system 2010 includes a plurality of electrochemical
cells 2012. In one form, electrochemical cells 2012 are solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).
In other embodiments, electrochemical cells 2012 may be one or more other types of
fuel cells. In one form, fuel cell system 2010 is configured as a segmented-in-series
fuel cell, that is, wherein electrochemical cells 2012 are arranged in a segmented-in
series configuration. It will be understood not only a limited number of electrochemical
cells 2012 are illustrated, and that those to the right and to the left of the drawing
illustrated in FIG. 23 are truncated for purposes of clarity of illustration, whereas the
actual number of electrochemical cells 2012 in a particular fuel cell system 2010 may
be any number greater or lesser than that illustrated in FIG. 23.
             Electrochemical cells 2012 are spaced apart in direction 1636, and are supported
by porous ceramic substrate 1614. Fuel cell system 2010 includes a plurality of
interconnects 1616 that are configured to conduct free electrons between adjacent
electrochemical cells 2012. As with fuel cell system 1610, each electrochemical cell
2012 includes an anode 1624, and electrolyte 1626, a cathode 1628, an anode current
collector 1648 and a cathode current collector 1650, each of which are arranged as set
forth above with respect to electrochemical cells 1612. Interconnect 1616 couples the
anode current collector 1648 and cathode current collector 1650 of adjacent cells to
                                                    76

used to form ceramic seal 1602, porous ceramic substrate 1614, interconnect 1616,
anode 1624, electrolyte 1626, cathode 1628, anode current collector 1648 and cathode

             An oxidant is supplied to electrochemical cells 2012 from an oxidant side 1618.
In one form, the oxidant is air. In other embodiments other oxidants may be used in
addition to or in place of air. Fuel is supplied to electrochemical cells 2012 on a fuel
side 1620 via porous substrate 1614. In some embodiments, channels and/or other
passages may be etched or otherwise formed into porous substrate 1614 in order to
facilitate the flow of fuel into electrochemical cells 2012. In one form, the fuel is syngas.
In other embodiments, other fuels may be used, e.g. hydrogen. In addition, in other
embodiments, fuel cell system 2010 and electrochemical cells 2012 may be configured
and arranged so that fuel and oxidant are supplied from opposite or other directions
than those described and illustrated herein.
             Fuel cell system 2010 includes a porous anode barrier (PAB) 1617. Porous
anode barrier 1617 is disposed vertically in direction 1632 between electrochemical
cells 2012 and porous substrate 1614. Porous anode barrier 1617 is provided in
segments having the same width as anode 1624, and are disposed below anodes 1624
in direction 1632. Ceramic seals 1602 are disposed between each segment of porous
anode barrier 1617 such that there is a ceramic seal 1602 disposed horizontally
adjacent to each of both sides of the porous anode barrier 1617 segment of each
electrochemical cell 2012. Porous anode barrier 1617 is configured to prevent reactions
between the anodes of electrochemical cells 2012 and the porous substrate 1614,
and/or the anode current collectors and the porous substrate 1614. In addition, porous
anode barrier 1617 is configured to provide sacrificial Ni upstream of anode 1624 and
anode current collector 1648, so that during the high fuel utilization conditions, the
sacrificial Ni in porous anode barrier 1617 will react with steam to form the Ni hydroxide

NiO may be employed relative to the embodiment of FIG. 22, since there is no direct
current flow path between adjacent electrochemical cells through porous anode barrier
1617, since it is bound on both sides by ceramic seals 1602. Greater protection against
anode 1624 and anode current collector 1648 Ni migration may be thus be obtained due
to the higher allowable NiO concentration in porous anode barrier 1617 in the
embodiment of fuel cell system 2010 and FIG. 25, relative to that of fuel cell system
1710 and FIG. 22.                  In addition, cost may be reduced, relative to the embodiments of
FIGS. 23 and 24, since only a single porous anode barrier is printed (porous anode
barrier 1617).
