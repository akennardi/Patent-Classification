Description
SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING MACHINE WORK
CYCLE PHASES
Technical Field
[0001]    This disclosure relates generally to earth working machines and the sites on which
they work. More particularly, this disclosure is directed to systems and methods for identifying
the work cycle phases of such machines based on accelerometer data.
Background
[0002]    A common operation on many worksites is the excavation and removal of material.
For example, in open-cut mines, material is excavated from a certain location and loaded into
trucks for transport to a designated dumping location. Loading machines, such as electric mining
shovels or excavators, are commonly used to load the trucks with material. Loading machines
collect material in a bucket and deliver it to the bed of the truck, which will usually have the
capacity for multiple bucket-loads of material.
[0003]    Monitoring the work cycles of the truck and/or the loading machine can be useful. For
example, a worksite operator may want to monitor the number of work cycles completed in a
workday to assess productivity, the amount of revenue generated, the amount of inventory
moved, or other parameters.
[0004]    Some operators, such as operators of large worksites, can afford high-end trucks and
loading machines equipped with sensors that support systems for monitoring work cycles. For
example, some high-end trucks have a payload sensor that measures the weight of the payload in
the truck bed, a bed sensor that senses whether the bed is raised or lowered, a gear sensor that
senses the gear in which the truck is operating, and/or a ground speed sensor that measures the
ground speed of the truck. High-end loading machines may have similar sensors, as well as a

                                                 -2
bucket sensor configured to sense the height or angle of the bucket. Using the information
provided by these sophisticated sensors, work cycles or phases thereof can be determined.
[0005]     One example of such a system is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 8,364,440 to Putkonen
("the '440 patent"). In the system described in the '440 patent, a loading machine is equipped
with sensors that monitor the signals of the control stick, including speed, direction, and tool
state. The loading machine also has a sensor that measures the weight of the payload in the
bucket. The '440 patent system applies a mathematical model to the information provided by
these sensors to determine the work cycle and state of the loading machine.
[0006]    While the system of the '440 patent may assist worksite operators in assessing
productivity, it may have certain drawbacks. For example, the equipment needed to implement
the monitoring of the '440 patent may be too expensive for operators of smaller worksites, such
as coal mines and quarries. And even operators of larger worksites may want to avoid
purchasing expensive equipment for monitoring work cycles. Accordingly, a less expensive
solution is needed.
[0007]    This disclosure is directed to overcoming one or more of the problems set forth above
and other problems in the art.
Summary of the Disclosure
[0008]    One aspect of the disclosure relates to system for monitoring work cycles on a
worksite that includes a truck and a loading machine. The system may include a
communications interface, memory storing instructions, and a processing unit. The processing
unit may be configured to execute the instructions to receive, via the communications interface,
location information and acceleration information for the truck and location information for the
loading machine. The processing unit may determine a distance between the truck and the
loading machine based on the location information. The processing unit may determine a phase
of a work cycle of the truck based on the determined distance between the truck and the loading
machine and on the acceleration information for the truck.

                                                  -3
[0009]     Another aspect of the disclosure relates to a method for monitoring work cycles on a
worksite that includes a truck and a loading machine. The method may include receiving
location information and acceleration information for the truck and location information for the
loading machine. The method may include determining, using a processing unit, a distance
between the truck and the loading machine based on the location information. The method may
include determining, using the processing unit, a phase of a work cycle of the truck based on the
determined distance between the truck and the loading machine and on the acceleration
information for the truck.
[0010]     Yet another aspect of the disclosure is directed to a system for monitoring work cycles
on a worksite that includes a truck and a loading machine. The system may include a
communications interface, memory storing instruction, and a processing unit. The processing
unit may be configured to execute the instructions to receive, via the communications interface,
location information and acceleration information for the loading machine and location
information for the truck. The processing unit may determine a distance between the loading
machine and the truck based on the location information. The processing unit may determine a
phase of a work cycle of the loading machine based on the determined distance between the
loading machine and the truck and on the acceleration information for the loading machine.

Detailed Description
[0011]     Fig. 1 illustrates a worksite 100 in which volumes of material may be moved between
locations, such as a loading location and a dumping location. The worksite 100 may be a mine, a
quarry, a scrap yard, or any other place where material is collected and moved between locations.
At the worksite 100, a loading machine 102-such as an excavator, electric shovel, or loader
may be operated to collect material-such as ore, rocks, and the like-in a bucket 104 and dump

                                                 -4
the material onto a bed 106 of a truck 108. The worksite 100 may have any number or
combination of trucks 108 and loading machines 102 (generally "machines").
[0012]     Fig. 2 shows an exemplary truck work cycle 200 of the truck 108 and a corresponding
exemplary work cycle 202 of the loading machine 102. The work cycle 200 of the truck 108 may
include a loading phase 204, a traveling full phase 206, a dumping phase 208, and a traveling
empty phase 210. The corresponding work cycle 202 of the loading machine 102 may include a
dumping phase 212, a swinging empty phase 214, a digging phase 216, and a swinging full phase
218.
[0013]     In the loading phase 204, the truck 108 may be positioned at or near the loading
location on the worksite 100, waiting to be loaded with material by the loading machine 102.
During that time, the loading machine 102 may be in the dumping phase 212, where the loading
machine 102 empties loads of material from its bucket 104 into the bed 106 of the truck 108 until
the bed 106 is full.
[0014]     After completing the loading phase 204, the truck 108 may enter the traveling full
phase 206. In the traveling full phase 206, the truck 108 may travel from the loading location to
the dumping location on the worksite 100. While the truck 108 is traveling full, the loading
machine 102 may enter the swinging empty phase 214, where the operator of the loading
machine 102 may operate the loading machine 102 to swing the empty bucket 104 back to the
digging location to dig and remove more material.
[0015]     The truck 108 may then enter the dumping phase 208, in which the operator of the
truck 108 may position the truck 108 at the dumping location on the worksite 100 and operate
the bed 106 to empty its payload of material. After the dumping phase 208, the truck 108 may
enter the traveling empty phase 210, where it returns to the loading location, empty, obtain
another load.

                                                  -5
[0016]     During the traveling full phase 206, the dumping phase 208, and/or the traveling empty
phase 210 of the truck 108, the loading machine 102 may begin the digging phase 216. In the
digging phase 216, the operator may control the loading machine 102 to fill the bucket 104 with
another load material from the digging location. Both cycles 200, 202 may then repeat in this
manner until the job is finished, the day ends, or some other event occurs.
[0017]     While the work cycles 200, 202 are described above as having four phases, further
granularity of phases is contemplated. For example, a queuing phase may be distinguished from
the loading phase 204 of the truck 108. In the queuing phase, for example, the truck 108 may be
waiting for other trucks to complete their loading phases 204. The loading machine 102 also
have a similar phase in which it is waiting for a truck 108 to arrive at the loading location.
[0018]     Returning to Fig. 1, the truck 108 and/or the loading machine 102 may be equipped
with respective processing systems 110, 112. The processing systems 110, 112 may include any
combination of computing components known it the art. These components may include
hardware computer processors configured to execute computer-readable instructions; electronic
control modules; volatile memory, nonvolatile memory, data storage devices (i.e., computer
readable media); communications interfaces and/or devices; and/or user input/output devices.
[0019]     The processing systems 110, 112 may be configured to receive and process data from
respective sensors 114, 116 on the truck 108 and the loading machine 102, respectively. In one
embodiment, the processing systems 110, 112 may be connected respectively to the sensors 114,
116 by a datalink, such as a controller area network (CAN) bus, a Modbus, a J1939 link, a Wi-Fi
link, or a Bluetooth link.
[0020]     In one embodiment, the sensors 114, 116 may include an accelerometer. The
accelerometer may be a device known in the art that is configured to measure acceleration of the
truck 108 or the loading machine 102 in the x-, y-, and/or z-axes, and to output a signal
indicative of the measured acceleration. For purposes of this description, in terms of the
orientation of the truck 108 or the loading machine 102, the x-axis may be the forward/backward
direction, the y-axis may be the left/right direction, and the z-axis may be the vertical direction.

                                                -6
[0021]     In another embodiment, the sensors 114, 116 may include a gyroscope. The gyroscope
may be a device known in the art that is configured to measure the rotation of truck 108 or
loading machine 102 around the x-, y-, and/or z-axes-roll, pitch, and/or yaw-and to output a
signal indicative of the measured rotation.
[0022]     In another embodiment, the sensors 114, 116 may include a magnetometer. The
magnetometer may be a device known in the art that is configured to measure a magnitude of the
magnetic field around the truck 108 or the loading machine 102 in the x-, y-, and/or z-axes, and
to output a signal indicative of a measured magnetic field. The signals output by the sensors 114,
116 may be received by the respective processing system 110, 112 in messages transmitted over
the datalink.
[0023]     The sensors 114, 116 may include any combination of the accelerometer, the
gyroscope, and the magnetometer. In one embodiment, the sensors 114, 116 may include only
the accelerometer. In another embodiment, the sensors 114, 116 may include all three
instruments. For example, the sensors 114, 116 may comprise a known inertial measurement unit
(IMU) package containing all three sensors. In another embodiment, the sensors 114, 116 may
include the accelerometer and either the gyroscope or the magnetometer.
[0024]     The sensors 114, 116 may also include a global positioning system (GPS) device. The
GPS device may be a device known in the art that is configured to determine the location of the
truck 108 or the loading machine 102 in an external coordinate system, such as latitude and
longitude. The GPS device may also be configured to output a signal indicative of the
determined location. The signal may be received at the respective processing system 110, 112 as
a message transmitted over the datalink.
[0025]     The sensors 114, 116 may include other types of sensors as well. For example, the
sensors 114, 116 may include a payload sensor that provides a weight or mass of a load in the
bucket 104 or the bed 106, a ground speed sensor that provides ground speed of the truck 108 or
the loading machine 102, a gear sensor that identifies the gear being used, and/or a body position
sensor that provides a body position of the truck 108 or the loading machine 102.

                                                 -7
[0026]     The processing systems 110, 112 may also be configured to wirelessly communicate,
via a radio 118, with a remote processing system 120. For example, the processing systems 110,
112 may transmit messages containing information about the acceleration, rotation, magnetic
field, and/or location of the truck 108 and the loading machine 102. The messages may be
transmitted via the radio 118 to the remote processing system 120. The messages may be
transmitted continuously or may be collected by the processing systems 110, 112 and
transmitted in batches.
[0027]     The radio 118 may be any type of wireless radio system or device known in the art. For
example, radio 118 include a Wi-Fi radio, a cellular radio (e.g., 3G, 4G, LTE, or LTE
Advanced), or a Bluetooth radio. In one embodiment, the radio 118 may communicate the
messages it receives from the processing systems 110, 112 of the truck 108 and the loading
machine 102 to the remote processing system 120 through a communications network 122. The
communications network 122 may include the Internet, an Ethernet, a local area network (LAN),
a wide area network (WAN), or any other type of electronic communications network known in
the art.
[0028]     Fig. 3 illustrates an embodiment of the remote processing system 120. The remote
processing system 120 may be located at the worksite 100 or elsewhere. In one embodiment, the
remote processing system 120 may include one or more dedicated servers or a cloud server
system on the communications network 122. The remote processing system 120 may be provided
as a service to assist an entity managing the worksite 100.
[0029]     As shown in Fig. 3, the remote processing system 120 may include a combination of
computing components known in the art for communicating, processing, and outputting data. For
example, the processing system 120 may include a processing unit 300. The processing unit 300
may include a single hardware computational processing device (e.g., a microprocessor) or a
number of such processing devices. Through a communications bus 302, the processing unit 300
may be in data communication with computer-readable media. The computer-readable media
may include system memory 304 (e.g., a read-only memory storing a BIOS for basic system
operations), volatile memory 306 (e.g., random-access memory such as one or more DRAM
modules), and/or non-transient memory 308 (e.g., one or more hard disk drives, solid state

                                                -8
drives, flash memory devices, or similar data storage devices). Instructions and data to control
operation of the processing unit 300 may be stored on the system, volatile, and/or non-transitory
memory 304, 306, and 308. The processing unit 300 may be configured to execute the
instructions and process the data to perform the disclosed functions. For example, the remote
processing system 120 may store and run one or more applications providing the disclosed
functions of the remote processing system 120.
[0030]     The remote processing system 120 may have one or more input/output interfaces 310
that allow the remote processing system 120 to interface with input/output devices 312. As will
be appreciated, a wide variety of input/output devices 312 may be used, such as keyboards,
pointing devices, touch-screens, touch-screen displays, displays, microphones, speakers,
computer-readable media (e.g., hard drives, solid state drives, or flash memory devices), or other
devices for receiving user input or providing user output. The remote processing system 120 may
also include one or more communications interface(s) 314, such as a Network Interface Cards
and/or modems, allowing for wired or wireless connection to the communications network 122.
[0031]      The remote processing system 120 may be configured to receive, via the
communications network 122, messages containing information measured by the sensors 114,
116 of the truck 108 and the loading machine 102. These messages may be transmitted by the
processing systems 110, 112 of the truck 108 and the loading machine 102 and received at the
remote processing system 120 during a specified period, such as part of a work day, an entire
work day, a work week, or another period over which analysis is desired. For example, the
remote processing system 120 may continuously or periodically receive one or more streams or
batches of such messages from the processing systems 110, 112 of the truck and the loading
machine 102.
[0032]     In one embodiment, the messages may include acceleration messages that contain
information about the acceleration of the truck 108 or the loading machine 102; rotation
messages containing information about the rotation of the truck 108 or the loading machine 102;
and/or magnetic field information messages containing information about the magnetic field
around the truck 108 or the loading machine 102. Additionally, the remote processing system
120 may receive location information messages containing information about the location of the

                                                  -9
truck 108 and the loading machine 102, such as the latitude and longitude determined by the
GPS device on the machines.
[0033]     In one embodiment, an acceleration information message may contain values for the
magnitude of the measured acceleration of the machine on any of the x-, y-, and/or z-axes.
Alternatively, the acceleration information message may contain a value for the magnitude of the
acceleration and a value for the direction of the acceleration of the machine. Still further, the
acceleration information message may have a value for the scalar magnitude of the acceleration
without any direction. The acceleration message may further contain an identifier identifying the
particular truck 108 or the loading machine 102 to which the message belongs. Alternatively or
additionally, the identifier may identify the particular sensor 114, 116 that measured the
acceleration of the truck 108 or the loading machine 102. The acceleration information message
may also contain a time stamp indicating a time at which the acceleration value for the truck 108
or the loading machine 102 was measured. Thus, in one embodiment, an acceleration
information message may have the following general structure:
 Acceleration Information Message
  Time Stamp                   Identifier(s)                 Acceleration Value(s)
[0034]     The rotation information message, the magnetic field information message, and the
location information message may have the same general structure as the acceleration
information message. But instead of having values for acceleration, these messages may have
values for the rotation of the machine, the magnetic field around the machine, and the location
of the machine, respectively. The message structure describe above is exemplary only and other
formats may be used instead. Additionally, although the acceleration, rotation, magnetic field,
and location information messages are described as separate messages, they may be combined
into a single message containing the individual messages as sub-messages or fields of
information within the larger message. The messages may be combined onboard the truck 108 or
the loading machine 102 by the respective processing systems 110, 112 before transmission to
the remote processing system 120, or may be combined at the remote processing system 120
after being received individually from the processing systems 110, 112 of the machines. The

                                                -10
remote processing system 120 may store the messages in memory 304-308 for further
processing.
[0035]     The remote processing system 120 may be configured to analyze and process the
received acceleration information messages, rotation information messages, magnetic field
information messages, and location information messages (or the combined messages). In
particular, the remote processing system 120 may create truck cycle data records and loading
machine cycle records. Each truck cycle data record may contain values for the acceleration of
the truck 108, the rotation of the truck 108, and/or the magnetic field around the truck 108
measured within the same sample period (e.g., 10-100 milliseconds). Similarly, each loading
machine cycle data record may contain values for the acceleration of the loading machine 102,
the rotation of the loading machine 102, and/or the magnetic field around the loading machine
102 measured within the same sample period.
[0036]     In one embodiment, the truck cycle data records may have the following structure:
  Truck Cycle Data Records
  Time            Distance         Acceleration of     Rotation of      Magnetic Field
                  Between          Truck               Truck            Around Truck
                  Truck and
                  Loading
                  Machine
[0037]     Each truck cycle data record may contain values measured by one or more sensors 114
of the truck 108 within the same sample period (e.g., 10 milliseconds). In particular, as shown in
the table above, a truck cycle data record may contain a time field. The time field may indicate
the time at which the values in the record were measured by the sensors 114 on the truck 108. All
values in the same row (i.e., record) may correspond to measurements taken at the same time
(i.e., within the same sampling period).

                                                 -11
[0038]     Each truck cycle data record may also contain a distance between the truck 108 and the
loading machine 102 at the time indicated in the time field for that data record. The remote
processing system 120 may be configured to determine this distance using location information
messages for the truck 108 and the loading machine 102 that have time stamps corresponding to
the time contained in the time field of the truck cycle data record. Thus, the distance field for
each record may indicate the distance between the truck 108 and the loading machine 102 at a
particular time.
[0039]     The truck cycle data record may also have one or more values for the acceleration of
the truck 108. The acceleration values may correspond to the acceleration measured on the truck
108 at the time contained in the time field of the truck cycle data record. The remote processing
system 120 may identify the acceleration values to use for each truck cycle data record from the
time stamp of the acceleration information messages of the truck 108. Thus, the acceleration
value(s) in each data record may have been sampled within the same period as the distance listed
in the distance field for that record. In one embodiment, to reduce the computing resources
needed to process the truck cycle data records, only acceleration in the z-direction (vertical) may
be used in the truck cycle data records. In other embodiments, however, any combination of
values of acceleration in the x-, y-, and z-direction may be used.
[0040]     As shown in the table above, the truck cycle data record may also contain fields for the
rotation of the truck 108 and the magnetic field around the truck 108. These fields may be similar
to the acceleration field, but may contain rotation values and magnetic fields values measured by
the sensors 114 at the time indicated in the time field of the data records. That is, the rotation and
magnetic field values in a record may have been sampled within the same sampling period as the
acceleration values in that record.
[0041]     Accordingly, each truck cycle data record may represent a "snapshot" of the truck
108's behavior and distance from the loading machine 102 on the worksite 100 at a particular
moment in time. And a set of truck cycle data records may indicate the truck 108's behavior and
distance from the loading machine 102 on the worksite 100 over a period of time (e.g., a work
day).

                                                  -12
[0042]     The fields in the truck cycle data records discussed above are exemplary. Any
combination of the fields discussed above may be used. For example, in one embodiment, a truck
cycle data record may reflect only the distance between the truck 108 and the loading machine
102 and the acceleration of the truck 108. In a further embodiment, the record may only contain
a value for the acceleration of the truck 108 on the z-axis, or in the vertical direction. Such
embodiments may require less computing resources to perform the disclosed processes while still
enabling accuracy in identifying the cycle phases of the truck 108. In still other embodiments, a
truck cycle data record may include values for different types of measurements, depending on
the sensors 114 available on the truck 108. For example, if the truck 108 has a payload sensor,
the truck cycle data record may alternatively or additionally contain a value indicating the weight
or mass of the payload in the bed 106 at that point in time.
[0043]     The loading machine cycle data records may be similar or even identical to the truck
cycle data record. However, a loading machine cycle data record may contain values for
acceleration, rotation, magnetic field, and/or other measurements discussed above (e.g., payload)
for the loading machine 102 instead of for the truck 108. For example, in one embodiment, the

                 Truck
[0044]     The remote processing system 120 may be configured to train a truck cycle learning
model using the truck cycle data records as input. The remote processing system may be further
configured to train a loading machine cycle learning model using the loading machine cycle data
records as input. As is known in the art, a learning model, when executed by a computer, may
process an input data set, identify patterns in the data set, and provide an output indicating the
identified patterns. One example of such a learning model is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).
However, any desired type of learning model may be used by the remote processing system 120

                                                -13
to train the truck cycle learning model. Other examples of learning models that can be used
include a Bayesian network and a neural network.
[0045]     In one embodiment, the remote processing system 120 may be configured to train the
truck cycle learning model to identify truck cycle data records that correspond to the loading
phase 204, the traveling full phase 206, the dumping phase 208, and the traveling empty phase
210. The remote processing system 120 may use the distance between the truck 108 and the
loading machine 102 and the corresponding acceleration values contained in the truck cycle data
records to train the learning model. In one configuration, only the z-axis acceleration value
(vertical) may be used. In other embodiments, any combination of the acceleration value(s), the
rotation values, and the magnetic field values may be used, in addition to the distance, to train
the truck cycle learning model.
[0046]     There may be certain patterns in the acceleration values for the truck 108 depending up
on the distance from the loading machine 102. Those patterns may correspond to particular cycle
phases of the truck 108. For example, in the loading phase 204, the truck 108 may be within a
certain distance of the loading machine 102. The distance from the truck 108 to the loading
machine 102 may not change much, or at all, during the loading phase 204. Additionally, since
the truck 108 is being loaded with material by the loading machine 102, the truck 108 may
bounce. This may cause z-direction (vertical) acceleration, and possibly x-direction and y
direction accelerations as well. As the bed 106 of the truck 108 is loaded with more material and
the combined mass of the truck 108 and the material increases, the truck 108 may bounce at a
lower rate and a higher amplitude. Thus, the truck cycle learning model may determine truck
cycle data records to correspond to the loading phase 204 based on the values for distance from
the truck 108 to the loading machine 102 and for acceleration, contained in the data records.
[0047]     When the truck 108 moves to the traveling full phase 206, the distance from the
loading machine 102 increases. Additionally, the truck 108 may bounce as it travels across the
worksite 100 to the dumping location. However, the truck 108 may bounce differently than it
bounces during the loading phase 204, when it is stationary and being loaded with material.
Different accelerations may also occur in the x-direction and the y-direction, as the truck 108
maneuvers through the worksite 100. Thus, the truck cycle learning model may determine that

                                                 -14
certain truck cycle data records correspond to the traveling full phase 206 based on the values for
distance from the truck 108 to the loading machine 102 and for acceleration contained in the data
records. The truck cycle data records can also be determined to correspond to the traveling full
phase 206 based on a determination that preceding data records correspond to the loading phase
204.
[0048]     When the truck 108 enters the dumping phase 208, the truck 108 may experience
acceleration that is different from the previous two phases as the bed 106 tilts and empties material
onto the dumping location. Additionally, the distance between the truck 108 and the loading
machine 102 may remain relatively constant and above a certain threshold distance because the
truck 108 stops at the dumping site. Thus, the truck cycle learning model may determine that
certain truck cycle data records correspond to the to the dumping phase 208 based on the values
for distance from the truck 108 to the loading machine 102 and for acceleration contained in the
data records. Truck cycle data records can also be determined to correspond to the dumping phase
208 based on a determination that preceding data records correspond to the traveling full phase
206.
[0049]     When the truck 108 enters the traveling empty phase 110, the truck 108 may
experience z-direction acceleration that is different from the acceleration when the truck 108 is
traveling full. For example, because the mass of the empty truck 108 is less than the combined
mass of the truck 108 and the material in the bed 106, the truck 108 may bounce at a higher rate
and a lower amplitude in the traveling empty phase 210 than in the traveling full phase 206.
Additionally, the distance between the truck 108 and the loading machine 102 may decrease
during this phase as the truck 108 travels across the worksite 100 to the loading location. Thus,
the truck cycle learning model may determine that certain truck cycle data records correspond to
the traveling empty phase 210 based on the values for distance from the truck 108 to the loading
machine 102 and for acceleration contained in the data records. Truck cycle data records can also
be determined to correspond to the traveling empty phase 210 based on a determination that
preceding data records correspond to the dumping phase 208.
[0050]     Other values in the truck cycle data records may alternatively or additionally be used
by the model to determine and/or corroborate the particular phase of the truck cycle 200. For

                                                  -15
example, in the loading phase 204, the loading machine 102 may swing its bucket 104 toward the
truck 108 and then away from the truck 108 after dropping the load of material. The movement
of the large metal bucket 104 and linkages of the loading machine 102 may cause a fluctuation in
the magnetic field around the truck 108. Similarly, in the dumping phase 208, the magnetic field
around the truck 108 may change as the metal bed 106 tilts to dump the load of material. But
unlike the loading phase 204 where the magnetic field around the truck 108 may fluctuate
several times as the bucket 104 moves toward and away from the truck 108 to fill the bed 108,
there may be only a single fluctuation in the magnetic field in the dumping phase 208 as the bed
108 tilts once and returns to its starting position after dumping the load of material. Thus, the
truck cycle data records can be determined to correspond to the dumping phase, 208, for
example, based on the values for distance from the truck 108 to the loading machine 102 and for
magnetic field around the truck 108 contained in the data records.
[0051]     In one embodiment, the remote processing system 120 may be configured to train the
truck cycle learning model to recognize the loading phase 204, the traveling full phase 206, the
dumping phase 208, and/or the traveling empty phase 210 of the truck work cycle 200. The
remote processing system 120 may train the truck cycle learning model using the values for
distance between the truck 108 and the loading machine 102, and the corresponding acceleration
of the truck 108, contained in the truck cycle data records. In one embodiment, the remote
processing system 120 may use only z-axis acceleration values to train the truck cycle learning
model. In other embodiments, the remote processing system 120 may use combinations of x-, y-,
and z-axis acceleration values to train the truck cycle learning model. The remote processing
system 120 may alternatively or additionally use other values contained in the truck cycle data
records, such as the rotation values and/or the magnetic field values. Remote processing system
120 may train the loading machine cycle learning model in the same way as the truck cycle
learning model, but using the loading machine cycle data records instead of the truck cycle data
records.
[0052]     Once the truck cycle learning model is trained, and/or during training, the remote
processing system 120 may be configured to provide the truck cycle data records as input to the
truck cycle learning model to generate an output of the particular phase 204-2 10 to which the
data records are determined to correspond. For example, in one embodiment, inputting a truck
cycle data record into the truck cycle learning model may produce a probability that the data

                                                  -16
record corresponds to each of the phases 204-210. The remote processing system 120 may then
select the phase 204-210 with the highest probability as the output for that data record.
[0053]     For example, inputting a particular data record into the truck cycle learning model may
produce an 85% probability that the data record corresponds to the loading phase 204 and a 5%
probability that the data record corresponds to each of the traveling full 206, dumping 208, or
traveling empty 210 phases. In this case, the remote processing system 120 may select the
loading phase 204 as the output for that data record because it has the highest probability.
[0054]     The remote processing system 120 may be further configured to update the truck cycle
data record with the outputted truck cycle phase 204-210. In the example above, the remote
processing system 120 may add a value indicating the loading phase 204 to the data record. For
example, the remote processing system 120 may add a column to the truck cycle data record
reflecting the determined truck cycle phase 204-210 for that data record:

[0055]     The remote processing system 120 may be further configured to analyze the truck cycle
data records to count the number of truck cycle phases 204-210 indicated in the updated truck
cycle data records. In one embodiment, the remote processing system 120 may be configured to
count the number of loading phases 204, traveling full phases 206, dumping phases 208, and/or
traveling empty phases 210. In other embodiments, only certain phases 204-2 10 may be counted.
For example, the operator of the worksite 100 may only be interested in the number of loads
dumped by the truck 108 during the workday, so that revenue can be determined. Accordingly, in

                                                -17
this example, the remote processing system 120 may be configured to count the number of
dumping phases 208 reflected in the truck cycle data records for the relevant time period.
[0056]     The remote processing system 120 may be further configured to output the counted
number of phase(s) 204-214, and/or other metrics based thereon, via the I/O devices 312 for
consideration by a user. Alternatively, or additionally, the remote processing system 120 may be
configured to communicate this output to a computing system associated with the entity
operating the worksite 100, where it may be viewed by worksite personnel. The remote
processing system 120 may also be configured to send a report reflecting this output, for
example, by e-mail to an e-mail address associated with the entity or another user of the remote
processing system 120.
[0057]     The remote processing system 120 may be configured to perform the same processes
with respect to the loading machine cycle learning model as described above for the truck cycle
learning model. In particular, the remote processing system may be configured to train a loading
machine cycle learning model; to provide the loading machine cycle data records as input to the
loading machine cycle learning model and output the loading machine cycle phases 212-218 to
which they correspond; and to update the loading machine cycle data records to reflect the phase
212-218 to which they are determined to correspond. The remote processing system 120 may be
further configured to count the number of each loading machine cycle phase 212-218, or of only
certain phases 212-218, reflected in the updated loading machine cycle data records. The remote
processing system 120 may also be configured to output the counted number of phase(s) 212
218-214, and/or other related metrics, or to send reports containing the same, as described above.
Industrial Applicability
[0058]     The disclosed embodiments may be applicable to any worksite for which it is desired
to monitor work cycles of machines, such as trucks and loading machines. The disclosed
embodiments may enable the worksite operator to automatically identify and count the work
cycles and phases of trucks and/or loading machines using inexpensive hardware. For example,
only an accelerometer and a GPS or other location device may be required instead of the more
sophisticated and/or expensive sensors used in prior solutions, such as load sensors, bucket
sensors, and/or control stick sensors. The worksite operator may thus avoid purchasing more

                                                  -18
expensive machines equipped with special hardware, or retrofitting older machines with the
same, while still being able to monitor work cycles.
[0059]     Fig. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary method 400 of monitoring the work
cycle 200 of the truck 108. However, the same method 400 may be performed to monitor the
work cycle 202 of the loading machine 102. The method 400 may be performed by the
processing unit 300 (Fig. 3) of the remote processing system 120, executing instructions stored in
memory 304-308.
[0060]     The remote processing system 120 may receive messages from the truck 108 and the
loading machine 102 (step 402). In particular, the remote processing system 120 may receive
acceleration information messages, rotation information messages, magnetic field information
messages, and location information messages from the truck 108 and the loading machine 102 as
described above. The remote processing system 120 may determine distances between the truck
108 and the loading machine 102 using the received location information messages of the truck
108 and the loading machine 102, as discussed above (step 404).
[0061]     The remote processing system 120 may create truck cycle data records (step 406). As
discussed above, the truck cycle data records may contain values for the distance between the
truck 108 and the loading machine 108 and for the acceleration of the truck 108 during particular
sampling periods. The truck cycle data records may alternatively or additionally include values
for the rotation of the truck 108 and/or the magnetic field around the truck 108 during the
sampling periods.
[0062]     The remote processing system 120 may determine whether a truck cycle learning
model is available (step 408). If a truck work cycle learning model is not available, the remote
processing system 120 may train a truck cycle learning model using the truck cycle data records
created in step 406 (step 410), as discussed above. If a truck cycle learning model is available,
the remote processing system may retrain the model using the truck cycle data records created in
step 406 (step 412).

                                                 -19
[0063]     The remote processing system 120 may process the truck cycle data records with the
trained truck cycle learning model to determine the phases 204-210 of the truck work cycle 200
to which they correspond, as discussed above (step 414). In step 414, the remote processing
system 120 may also update the truck cycle data records to reflect the determined phase 204-2 10,
as discussed above.
[0064]     The remote processing system 120 may determine whether there are more truck cycle
data records available for processing (step 416). If no additional records are available, the
method 400 may end. If additional records are available, the method may return to step 406.
[0065]     While the preceding text sets forth a detailed description of numerous different
embodiments of the invention, it should be understood that the legal scope of the invention is
defined by the words of the claims set forth at the end of this patent. The detailed description is
to be construed as exemplary only and does not describe every possible embodiment of the
invention since describing every possible embodiment would be impractical, not impossible.
Numerous alternative embodiments could be implemented, using either current technology or
technology developed after the filing date of this patent, which would still fall within the scope
of the claims defining the invention.
