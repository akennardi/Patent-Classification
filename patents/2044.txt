  dilution into a pesticide spray mixture.

                METHODS OF USING TANKMIX ADDITIVE CONCENTRATES
                                   CONTAINING PARAFFINIC OILS
             This application is a divisional of Australian patent application no. 2015247525, the
 5  entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                              BACKGROUND
             Economical, commercially available techniques for agricultural spraying typically
    include the use of hydraulic spray nozzles that inherently produce a wide spectrum of spray
    droplet sizes. The potential for these spray droplets to drift from the initial, desired site of
 0  application is a function of droplet size, with smaller droplets having a higher propensity for
    off-target movement. Although other factors such as meteorological conditions and spray
    boom height contribute to the potential for drift, spray droplet size distribution has been
    found to be a predominant factor. Teske et. al. (Teske M. E., Hewitt A. J., Valcore, D. L.
    2004. The Role of Small Droplets in Classifying Drop Size DistributionsILASS Americas
 5  17th Annual Conference: Arlington VA) have reported a value of <156 microns (pm) as the
    fraction of the spray droplet distribution that contributes to drift. Robert Wolf (Wolf, R. E.,
    Keys to Spray Drift Management, Microsoft* PowerPoint Presentation (filename: Drift
    Minimization - 2009), available at www.bae.ksu.edu/faculty/wolf/PowerPoint.htm, last
    viewed October 8, 2013) cites a value of <200 tm as the driftable fraction.
 10          The negative consequences of off-target movement can be quite pronounced. Some
    herbicides have demonstrated very sensitive phytotoxicity to particular plant species at
    extremely low parts per million (ppm) or even parts per billion (ppb) levels, resulting in
    restricted applications around sensitive crops, orchards, and residential plantings. For
    example, the California Dept of Pesticide Regulation imposes buffers of         2 - 2 miles for
25  propanil containing herbicides applied aerially in the San Joaquin valley.
             Significant research efforts, involving numerous field trials, wind tunnel tests and
    subsequent generation of predictive math models, have led to a better understanding of the
    relationship between spray droplet size and the potential for off-target drift. Based on this
    work, it has been found that a good estimation of droplet size likely to contribute to drift is
30  the fraction of spray droplets having a diameter less than about 150 pim.
                                                       1

            The use of excipients and carriers have been investigated as a means for reducing
    drift. WO/2013/142263 describes the use of vegetable oils as an excipient/carrier for reducing
    drift. However, the use of vegetable or seeds oils can raise the freezing point of herbicide
    formulations. For example, an aqueous solution of 2,4-D choline freezes at about -20'C. The
 5  addition of a vegetable or seed oil, such as canola oil, palm oil, sunflower oil, etc.) raise the
    freezing point to -100 C.  The raising of the freezing point can affect the performance of the
    herbicidal composition, particularly when stored at low temperatures before use.
                                              SUMMARY
            The methods described herein include the use of tankmix additive concentrates
 0  containing a surfactant and a petroleum derived paraffinic oil to reduce spray drift. The
    tankmix additive concentrates used with the methods described herein include from 0.5 to 50
    weight percent of a surfactant, wherein the surfactant is a polymeric surfactant, a nonionic
    surfactant, a anionic surfactant, or mixtures thereof, and from 1 to 95 weight percent of a
    petroleum derived paraffinic oil. In the methods, the tankmix additive concentrate is added to
 5  a pesticide spray mixture and upon addition forms a stable emulsion in the pesticide spray
    mixture.
                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
            Methods of using tankmix additive concentrate compositions to reduce spray drift are
    described herein. The methods reduce the amount of driftable fines of spray solutions in both
 '0 aerial and ground spray applications. The methods include the use of tankmix additive
    concentrates incorporating a surfactant, selected from a polymeric surfactant, a anionic
    surfactant and a nonionic surfactant, or mixtures thereof, and a petroleum derived paraffinic
    oil.
            The tankmix additive concentrates as used in the methods described herein include
25  from 0.5 to 50 weight percent of a surfactant, selected from a polymeric surfactant, a anionic
    surfactant and a nonionic surfactant, or mixtures thereof, and from 1 to 95 weight percent of a
    petroleum derived paraffinic oil. The tankmix additive concentrates described herein form a
    stable emulsion upon dilution into a pesticide spray mixture.
            The tankmix additive concentrates can be used in spray mixtures containing a
30  pesticide and/or crop protection agent including herbicides, herbicide safeners, fungicides and
    insecticides. The pesticide or crop protection agent may be in the form of a water soluble
                                                     2

   derivative such as, for example, a water soluble salt. In some embodiments, the water
   soluble salt is a water-soluble salt of one or more auxinic herbicides.
           The concentrate is typically diluted with water to form a stable emulsion. The
   concentrate and/or water to which the concentrate is added can contain one or more
 5 additional additives, such as emulsifiers, antifoam agents, preservatives, antioxidants,
   colorants, and inert filling materials.
   I.      Definitions
           As used herein tankmix additive concentrate compositions are solutions containing a
   surfactant dissolved in a petroleum derived paraffinic oil. Such compositions, when added to
 0 an aqueous pesticide spray mixture, form a stable emulsion that upon spray application lead
   to a reduction in the amount of driftable fines.
           As used herein, petroleum derived paraffinic oils refers to liquids, oils, and/or waxes
   derived from petroleum or petroleum derivatives.
   II.     Method of Use
 5         A.       Tankmix additive concentrates
           The tankmix additive concentrates as used in the methods described herein include
   from about 0.5 to about 50 weight percent of a surfactant, selected from a polymeric
   surfactant, a anionic surfactant and a nonionic surfactant, or mixtures thereof, and from about
   1 to about 95 weight percent of a petroleum derived paraffinic oil. The tankmix additive
20 concentrates form a stable emulsion upon dilution into a pesticide spray mixture.
           The tankmix additive concentrates can be stored in suitable containers as will be
   readily recognized by one of skill in the art and can be, for example, solutions or emulsions.
           The tankmix additive concentrates may optionally contain one or more additional
   compatible ingredients. Also, any other additional ingredients providing functional utility
25 such as, for example, biocides, dyes, stabilizers, fragrants, viscosity-lowering additives,
   emulsifiers, colorants, preservatives, antifoaming agents, antioxidants, inert fillers,
   compatibility agents, organic co-solvents such as, for example, propylene glycol, propylene
   glycol ethers, dipropylene glycol ethers, ethylene glycol ethers and/or diethylene glycol
   ethers, and freeze-point depressants may be included in these tankmix additive concentrates.
30 The use of organic co-solvents in the concentrates and spray solutions described herein may
   provide freezing-point depression and/or enhanced emulsion stability to these compositions.

 5 III.    Pesticide Sprays
           A.      Pesticide Spray Mixtures
           The methods described herein may include the application of one or more additional
   active ingredients to control a wide variety of unwanted plants, fungi, or insects. The
   tankmix additive concentrates as described herein may be diluted from 1 to 2000 fold in a
 0 pesticide spray mixture (e.g., a water based solution) at the point of use depending on the
   local agricultural practices and used in pesticide spray applications to control weeds, insects,
   or fungi in crop and non-crop environments.
           In an example of a pesticide spray mixture containing an auxin herbicide and an
   additional herbicide used in the methods described herein, the auxinic herbicide is a water
 5 soluble salt of 2,4-D or a water soluble salt of dicamba and the additional herbicide is
   glyphosate or glufosinate. In another example of a pesticide spray mixture containing an
   auxinic herbicide and an additional herbicide used in the methods described herein, the
   auxinic herbicide is 2,4-D choline salt or 2,4-D dimethyl ammonium salt and the additional
   herbicide is glyphosate dimethyl ammonium salt, glyphosate isopropyl ammonium salt, or
 0 glyphosate potassium salt. In a further example of a pesticide spray mixture containing an
   auxinic herbicide and an additional herbicide used in the methods described herein, the
   auxinic herbicide is 2,4-D choline salt or 2,4-D dimethyl ammonium salt, the additional
   herbicide is glyphosate dimethyl ammonium salt, glyphosate isopropyl ammonium salt, or
   glyphosate potassium salt, and the petroleum derived paraffinic oil includes a normal
25 paraffin, an isoparaffin, a cycloparaffin, a highly refined paraffinic mineral oil, a solvent
   dewaxed light or heavy paraffinic distillate and the like, or mixtures thereof. Examples of
   commercially available petroleum derived paraffinic oils useful in the methods and
   compositions described herein include Sunspray 6N and 1 IN which are available from
   HollyFrontier (Tulsa, OK).
30            In an additional example of a pesticide spray mixture containing an auxinic
   herbicide and an additional herbicide used in the methods described herein, the auxinic
   herbicide is 2,4-D choline salt, the additional herbicide is glyphosate dimethyl ammonium
                                                    17

   salt, and the petroleum derived paraffinic oil includes a normal paraffin, an isoparaffin, a
   cycloparaffin, a highly refined paraffinic mineral oil, a solvent dewaxed light or heavy
   paraffinic distillate, and the like, or mixtures thereof. Examples of commercially available
   petroleum derived paraffinic oils useful in the methods and compositions described herein
 5 include, but are not limited to, Sunspray 6N and 1IN which are available from
   HollyFrontier (Tulsa, OK).
            In an example of a pesticide spray mixture to which a tankmix additive concentrate as
   described herein has been added to be used in the methods described herein, the pesticide
   spray mixture contains a herbicide, the herbicide is an auxinic herbicide, and the auxinic
 0 herbicide is 2,4-D choline salt or 2,4-D dimethyl ammonium salt. In another example of a
   pesticide spray mixture to which a tankmix additive concentrate as described herein has been
   added, the pesticide spray mixture contains an auxinic herbicide, the auxinic herbicide is 2,4
   D choline salt or 2,4-D dimethyl ammonium salt, and the petroleum derived paraffinic oil is a
   normal paraffin, an isoparaffin, a cycloparaffin, a highly refined paraffinic mineral oil, a
 5 solvent dewaxed light or heavy paraffinic distillate, and the like, or mixtures thereof. In a
   further example of a pesticide spray mixture to which a tankmix additive concentrate as
   described herein has been added, the pesticide spray mixture contains an auxinic herbicide,
   the auxinic herbicide is 2,4-D choline salt and the petroleum derived paraffinic oil is a normal
   paraffin, an isoparaffin, a cycloparaffin, a highly refined paraffinic mineral oil, a solvent
 O dewaxed light or heavy paraffinic distillate, and the like, or mixtures thereof.
            B.       Spray Droplet Size
            The optimum spray droplet size for a pesticide spray mixture when sprayed depends
   on the application for which the pesticide spray mixture is used. If droplets are too large,
   there will be less coverage by the spray; i.e, large droplets will land in certain areas while
25 areas in between will receive little or no spray coverage. The maximum acceptable droplet
   size may depend on the amount of pesticide spray mixture being applied per unit area and the
   need for uniformity in spray coverage. Smaller droplets provide more even coverage, but are
   more prone to drift during spraying. Thus, application parameters such as uniformity in spray
   coverage must be balanced against the tendency for smaller droplets to drift. For example, if
30 it is particularly windy during spraying, larger droplets may be needed to reduce drift,
   whereas on a calmer day smaller droplets may be acceptable.
            In addition to the physical properties of a particular pesticide spray mixture, spray
   droplet size ay also depend on the spray apparatus, e.g., nozzle size and configuration. The
                                                    18

    reduction in spray drift may result from a variety of factors including a reduction in the
    production of fine spray droplets (<150 im minimum diameter) and an increase in the
    volume median diameter (VMD) of the spray droplets. In any event, for a given spray
    apparatus, application, and conditions, and based on the petroleum derived paraffinic oil, the
 5  median diameter of the plurality of spray droplets created using the tankmix additive
    concentrates and methods described herein is increased above that of a pesticide spray
    mixture that does not include the petroleum derived paraffinic oil as described herein. In
    some embodiments, spray mixtures containing the concentrate have volume percentage of
    driftable fines having a diameter less than 150 microns from about 20% to about 35%,
 0  preferably from about 20% to about 30%, more preferably from about 20% to about 25%.
            C.       Spraying Near Sensitive or Susceptible Crops
            The methods and compositions described herein are designed to be used in crops in
    which the particular pesticide used will not harm the crop or in situations where a crop is not
    present. The low drift properties of the compositions and the use of the compositions in the
 5  described methods also have benefits in relation to any sensitive or susceptible crops that are
    near the area upon which the composition is applied. For example, if the methods or
    compositions described herein are used with a pesticide-tolerant crop, the drift reduction will
    allow a non-tolerant crop to grow nearby without fear that any drift of a pesticide that would
    occur during the spray process with other non-low drift pesticide spray mixtures will deliver
 '0 the pesticide to the nearby crop. As used herein, a sensitive or susceptible crop is one that is
    sensitive or susceptible to the herbicidal activity of the pesticide being applied, i.e., the
    pesticide kills, controls, or otherwise adversely modifies the growth of the nearby crop.
    Thus, the compositions and methods described herein can be used near sensitive or
    susceptible crops. For example, a composition as described herein including 2,4-D choline
25  can be used on a 2,4-D tolerant crop with a non-2,4-D tolerant crop in a nearby field with
    minimal or no drift of the 2,4-D choline to the non-2,4-D tolerant crop. The actual distance
    of a nearby field can depend on the actual sensitivity of the nearby crop and can be varied
    depending on the sensitive or susceptible crop for planning purposes. For example, a nearby
    field can be 10 feet or more away, 15 feet or more away, 20 feet or more away, 25 feet or
30  more away, 30 feet or more away, 35 feet or more away, 40 feet or more away, 45 feet or
    more away, 50 feet or more away, 55 feet or more away, 60 feet or more away, 65 feet or
    more away, 70 feet or more away, 75 feet or more away, 80 feet or more away, 85 feet or
    more away, 90 feet or more away, 95 feet or more away, or 100 feet or more away.
                                                     19

   Additionally, a nearby field can be 110 feet or more away, 120 feet or more away, 130 feet or
   more away, 140 feet or more away, 150 feet or more away, 160 feet or more away, 170 feet
   or more away, 180 feet or more away, 190 feet or more away, or 200 feet or more away.
   Further, a nearby field can be 225 feet or more away, 250 feet or more away, 275 feet or
 5 more away, 300 feet or more away, 325 feet or more away, 350 feet or more away, 375 feet
   or more away, 400 feet or more away, 425 feet or more away, 450 feet or more away, 475
   feet or more away, 500 feet or more away, 525 feet or more away, 550 feet or more away,
   575 feet or more away, 600 feet or more away, 625 feet or more away, 650 feet or more
   away, 675 feet or more away, 700 feet or more away, 725 feet or more away, 750 feet or
 0 more away, 775 feet or more away, 800 feet or more away, 825 feet or more away, 850 feet
   or more away, 875 feet or more away, 900 feet or more away, 925 feet or more away, 950
   feet or more away, 975 feet or more away, or 1000 feet or more away.
           The following Examples are presented to illustrate various aspects of the
   compositions and methods described herein and should not be construed as limitations to the
 5 claims.
