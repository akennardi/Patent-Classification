                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer death with a poor
   prognosis. 70% of lung cancer patients are suffering from non-small cell lung cancer
   (NSCLC). At the same time, more and more patients are found to have or develop
15 chemo-resistance against chemotherapeutic agents that are currently used. For
   instance, gemcitabine (2', 2'-difluroro-2'-deoxycytidine) is a known chemotherapeutic
   agent for first-line treatments of patients suffering from NSCLC. Gemcitabine was
   found to induce DNA damage, cause cell cycle arrest and induce cells apoptosis. It
   was reported that gemcitabine is capable of down-regulating anti-apoptotic proteins
20 and up-regulating pro-apoptotic proteins in lung cancer cells. However, de novo and
   acquired chemo-resistance developed in patients seriously restrict the therapeutic
   efficacy and application of it.
   Some alkaloids are found to have effect in inhibiting cancer such as by enhancing the
25 efficacy of an anti-cancer drug. However, most of them are often toxic to human.
   Accordingly, there remains a strong need for therapeutic approaches for treating
   cancer in particular cancer such as non-small cell lung cancer as a leading cause of
   cancer death and most common type of lung cancer.

15 binary gradient of water and 0.3 M potassium phosphate buffer using an anion
   exchange column (Partisil-SAX, Whatman, Inc., Clifton, NJ). Their concentrations
   were determined from the absorption at 272 nm.
                                         Cell Culture
20 A549 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
   serum (FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 pg/mL streptomycin in a 37'C humidified
   incubator with a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere. Cells were seeded in 100 mm by 20 mm
   dishes (Corning Inc, Corning, NY, USA). After overnight culture, they were divided into
   different treatment groups as follows: Control group (Ctr), cells was incubated with
25 medium alone; Compound A group, cells were exposed to 40.Opg/mL of Compound A
   for 4 h; gemcitabine group (dFdC), cells were exposed to 5.0 pM of gemcitabine for 4
   h; combination group (Compound A + dFdC), cells were exposed to 40.0 pg/mL of
   Compound A combined with 5.0 pM of gemcitabine for 4 h. An extra dish of cells was
   incubated for cell counting on the day of cell harvest for normalization of nucleotide
30 pools, and viability was assessed by the tryphan blue exclusion assay.
   After treatments, monolayer A549 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS once and
   trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Cells from two or three dishes were then re
   suspended in 12 mL ice-cold PBS. After centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, the cell
35 pellet was washed with 1 mL ice-cold PBS again and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5

                                              - 13
   min. The cell pellet was incubated with 150 pL of 15 % trichloroacetic acid (TCA)
   containing 7.5 pL of 20.0 pM ATP13 C15 N as internal standard, and placed on ice for 10
   min. After centrifugation at 13,500 rpm for 15 min in the cold room, the acidic
   supernatant was separated and neutralized twice with 80 pL mixture of trioctylamine
 5 and 1, 1, 2-trichlorotrifluoroethane (45:55 v/v). Samples were stored at -80    0C  until
   analysis within two days.
                                        LC-MS/MS Assay
   LC-MS/MS assay was performed on a Thermo Fisher TSQ LC-MS/MS system
10 consisted of an Accela Autosampler, an Accela pump and a Quantum Access triple
   quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., San Jose, CA, USA).
   Data acquisition was performed with the Xcalibur software version 2.0.7, and data
   processing using the Thermo LCquan 2.5.6 data analysis program (Thermo Fischer).
   The chromatographic separation was achieved using an XTerra-MS C18 column (150
15 mm X 2.1 mm i.d., 3.5 pm, Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). The two eluents were: (A)
   5 mM HA-0.5% DEA in water, pH adjusted to 10 with acetic acid; and (B) 50%
   acetonitrile in water. The mobile phase consisted of a linear gradient of A and B: 0-15
   min, 100-80 % A (v/v); 15-35 min, 80-70% A; 35-45 min, 70-45 % A; 45-46 min, 45
   0 % A; 46-50 min, 0-0 % A; 50-51 min, 0-100 % A; 51-70 min, 100-100 % A. The
20 liquid flow-rate was set at 0.3 mL/min, and the column temperature was maintained at
   35 0 C. For all dRNs, the following optimized parameters were obtained. The sheath
   gas pressure reached 40 psi. The ion spray voltage was set at 3000 V for negative
   mode and 4000 V for positive mode at a temperature of 3500 C and auxiliary gas
   pressure of 15 psi. Quantification was performed using multiple reactions monitoring
25 (MRM) as described in Guo J, et al. Scientific reports. 2015;5 (36).
                                       Cell viability assay
   The inhibitory effect of different treatment groups on A549 cells was determined by
   the cytotoxic MTT assay. A549 cells were seeded in 96 wells plate (LabServ, Thermo
30 Fisher Scientific Co., Beijing, China) at 3x103 cells/well. After incubation, they were
   treated with the above-described concentrations of Compound A, dFdC or the
   combination for 24 h. MTT solution (final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in medium) was
   added to each well and incubated further for 4 h. The medium was removed, and 100
   pL of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the purple crystals of formazan.
35 Absorbance was measured at 570 nm with a microplate UV/VIS spectrophotometer

                                               -14
   (Infinite M200    PRO, Tecan Austria         GmbH 5082, Gr6dig, Austria);      reference
   wavelength was 630 nm. The cell number was determined using a hemocytometer.
   The figures were exported by GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc. CA,
   USA).    Cell viability (%)  = [OD      (treated)-OD (blank)]/[OD(control,untreated)-OD
 5 (blank)]x100. Drug interaction was evaluated by the combination index (CI) methods,
   whereas C1<1, CI=1, or CI>1 indicates synergism, additive effect or antagonism,
   respectively (37, 38). CI values were calculated by CompuSyn software (ComboSyn,
   Inc. NY, USA).
10                                      Cell cycle analysis
   The cell cycle analysis was determined as described in Guo J-R, et al. Molecules.
   2016;21(9):1254. In brief, Cells were seeded at 3.5x101 cells/well in 6-well culture
   plates in duplicate, and incubated with indicated concentrations of Compound A,
   dFdC or the combination for 24 h. They were then harvested and fixed in 70% (v/v)
15 cold ethanol overnight at 40 C. The fixed cells were collected by centrifugation and re
   suspended in PBS and incubated with 5 mg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and
   10 mg/mL RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The
   cells were then analyzed on a flow cytometer (MuseTM cell analyzer, Merck Millipore,
   Darmstadt, Germany). Finally, the percentages of cells in different phases (GO/G1, S
20 and G2/M) were calculated using Modfit software (Verity Software House, USA).
                                    Cell apoptosis analysis
   Apoptosis was quantified using the MuseTM Annexin V & Dead Cell Kit (Merck Limited,
   Darmstadt, Germany). Cells treated with Compound A, dFdC or combination for 24 h
25 were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with 4'C PBS, and re-suspended in
   1% FBS. MuseTM Annexin V & Dead Cell reagent was then added to stain the cells
   before analysis by flow cytometry (MuseTM cell analyzer, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt,
   Germany).
30                                   Western Blot analysis
   A549 cells were treated with Compound A, dFdC, and the combination of them for 24
   h, respectively. At the end of the incubation time, every group cells were harvested
   and lysed in RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies Inc. Beverly, MA, USA).
   Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratory, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to determine
35 protein concentration. Briefly, cell lysates were mixed with 5xSDS-loading buffer (4:1,

                                               -15
   v/v) and heated at 100   0C  with locked capping for 5 min. Such treated lysates (30 pg)
   were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the cell extracts from SDS
   PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Merck Millipore, USA) for
   incubating with rabbit caspase-3 antibody (dilution ratio = 1:1000; Cell Signaling
 5 Technology, Inc. Danvers, MA, USA), mouse caspase-7 antibody (dilution ratio
   1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit caspase-8 antibody (dilution ratio 1:1000;
   Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit caspase-9 antibody (Dilution ratio 1:1000; Cell
   Signaling Technology), mouse PARP antibody (dilution ratio 1:1000; Abcam@,
   Cambridge, UK), rabbit Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Bak antibodies (Dilution ratio 1:1000;
10 Abcam@), mouse Bax antibody (Dilution ratio 1:1000; Abcam@) and p-actin antibody
   (Dilution ratio 1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) overnight at 40 C. The
   above were followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated antibodies (Dilution ratio
   1:10000; Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h. Visualization of the protein bands by
   using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland, UK).
15 The bands were analyzed busing the Image J 1.46r software (National Institutes of
   Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
                                        Statistical analysis
   Data analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics (International Business
20 Machines Corp. Armonk,New York, USA) and GraphPad Prism softwares (Graph-Pad
   Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). All results are expressed as mean ± SD values
   from three independent replicate experiments. P value of less than 0.05 was
   considered to be statistically significant by using the Student's t test.
25                                         EXAMPLE1
                Cytotoxicity of Compound A on non-small cell lung cancer cells
   The intrinsic cytotoxicity of Compound A was determined by the cytotoxic MTT (3-[4,
   5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. A549 cells were
   treated with different concentrations of Compound A (0-80.0 pg/mL) for 24 h. With
30 reference to Fig. 1A, the MTT assays showed that Compound A at 40.0 pg/mL had no
   obvious cytotoxic effect to the cells with more than 85% cells survived, whereas
   Compound A has stronger cytotoxic effect to the cells a concentration of 80 pg/mL. At
   the same time, cells treated with the combination of 5.0 pM dFdC and 40.0 pg/mL
   Compound A show a significant decrease in cell viability after being treated for 24 h.
35 Referring to Fig. 1b, the viability of cells decreases from 82.3±5.6 % to 51.0±6.6 %.

                                              - 16
   The value of the combination index (CI) was 0.60. These cell viability studies and CI
   results show that dFdC and Compound A may have synergistic cytotoxic effect
   against cancer cells, in particular against non-small cell lung cancer cells.
 5                                         EXAMPLE2
       Effect of Compound A on the level of ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides
   The main mechanism of dFdC is to cause the perturbation of RNs and dRNs pool
   sizes in cells. In order to investigate whether Compound A can enhance the cytotoxic
   action of dFdC by modulating the RNs and dRNs levels, the LC-MS/MS assay was
10 used to analyze the concentrations of RNs and dRNs after treatment with Compound
   A in the presence or absence of dFdC in A549 cells. When cells were treated with
   Compound A alone, there were remarkable changes in the levels of RNs, with
   significant increases in nucleoside monophosphates (AMP, CMP, GMP and UMP)
   and nucleoside diphosphates (ADP, CDP, GDP and UDP) pools, while the nucleoside
15 triphosphates (ATP, CTP and GTP) decreased. Monophosphate metabolites can be
   phosphorylated into diphosphates under the nucleoside monophosphate kinase
   (NMPK), and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) could transform diphosphates to
   triphosphates metabolites. These findings show the Compound A is capable of
   increasing the levels of NMPK and NDPK in the target cells.
20
   In contrary, the pools of adenosine-triphosphate (ATP), cytidine triphosphate (CTP)
   and uridine triphosphate (UTP) were enhanced after the treatment with gemcitabine
   alone. The change trends of RNs concentration in the combination group were similar
   to that of the dFdC group, except for the decrease in ATP, guanosine triphosphate
25 (GTP), cytidine monophosphate (CMP) and the no remarkably changes in CTP. Given
   that both of Compound A and dFdC have effect on the levels of RNs, the different
   changes of RNs in Compound A + dFdC group was the action of the combined effects
   of this two compounds (Table 1).

   Tables 2 and 3 show the general properties and differences in dRNs pool sizes of
   A549 cells in each group. Treatment of A549 cells with 40.0 pg/mL Compound A for 4
   h results in depletion of deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) and deoxythymine
   triphosphate (dTTP). On the other hand, there were significant decreases in
10 triphosphates metabolites after 4 h of incubation with dFdC due to the inhibition of
   ribonucleotide reductase. At the same time, significant increases in ATP/dATP,
   CTP/dCTP and GTP/dGTP ratios were observed after treatment with dFdC in the
   presence or absence of Compound A due to the decrease of corresponding
   deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). Furthermore, the levels of dNTPs
15 including dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP in the dFdC combined with Compound A
   group were significantly lower than that of dFdC group, suggesting that Compound A
   may enhance the effect of dFdC through regulation of dRNs pool sizes. However, it is
   interesting that the pool of dFdCTP in Compound A + dFdC group decreased
   significantly compared with dFdC group, suggesting that Compound A enhanced the
20 anticancer effect of dFdC not by increasing the level of active metabolites of dFdC,
   and dFdCTP. Other pathways may cause such changes.

   The absolute amount of each RN and dRN was used to obtain a data matrix
   consisting of 12 objects and 27 variables. To further understand and visualize the
   grouping trends in samples treated with Compound A, dFdC or the combination,
15 respectively, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to assess
   the similarity of the different groups (SIMCA-P version 14.0 software, Umetrics,
   Sweden). The PLS-DA scores plot in Fig. 2a shows a significant separation in the
   profiles of RNs and dRNs pools in cells after treatment with dFdC in the presence or
   absence of Compound A. Moreover, Figs. 2b and 2c illustrate that sample points in

                                            -19
   the dFdC-treated group and combination group were significantly classified into two
   groups, suggesting that Compound A was able to stimulate the perturbation of RNs
   and dRNs levels induced by dFdC. At the same time, as seen from Figs. 2d and 2e,
   five RNs including ATP, GTP, CTP, CMP and uridine triphosphate (UTP), and seven
 5 dRNs including deoxycytidine diphosphate (dCDP), dATP, dTTP, deoxyguanosine
   triphosphate   (dGTP),    deoxyadenosine     monophosphate      (dAMP),     deoxythymine
   monophosphate (dTMP) and deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) were screened out
   base on P<0.05 and VIP>1.0.

                          Effects of Compound A on cell cycle arrest
   To determine whether Compound A can induce cell cycle arrest in A549 cells, flow
   cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle distribution after treatment with
   Compound A or dFdC or the combination for 24 h. As shown in Figs. 3a to 3e,
15 exposure to Compound A in A549 cells resulted in a decrease in the GO/G1 phase
   that was accompanied by an increase in the S phase. The ratio of cells in the GO/G1
   phase increased, and that in the G2/M phase decreased in cells treated with dFdC
   alone. Compared with single compounds, the distribution of the cell cycle in
   combination treatment group was similar to that of dFdC group, suggesting that the
20 combination treatment has a slight synergistic action in cell cycle arrest.
                                         EXAMPLE 4
          Effects of the combination of Compound A and gemcitabine on apoptosis
   To identify whether the growth inhibitory effect is achieved via inducing apoptosis, the
25 occurrence of apoptosis was verified by flow cytometry. As shown in Figs. 4a to 4e,
   treatment of A549 cells with Compound A for 24 h resulted in slight increase in the
   percentage of early and late apoptosis cells, while the ratio of viable cells reduced.
   The change of apoptotic cells in the dFdC alone group was similar to that in the
   Compound A alone group. Moreover, compared with single-compound groups,
30 combined treatment with Compound A and dFdC induced a significantly higher
   proportion of cells in early apoptosis and late apoptosis, showing the combination
   treatment   has synergistic effect    in promoting     apoptosis. The above        results
   demonstrated that the combined treatment using Compound A and dFdC effectively
   induces apoptosis in A549 cells. The apoptosis pathways of combination treatment
35 were further studied.

                                             - 20
   Generally, there are two main pathways in apoptosis, the intrinsic pathway and
   extrinsic pathway. As can be seen from Fig. 5, the intrinsic signaling pathway is
   regulated by the Bcl-2 family proteins. One subset of proteins exhibit have pro
 5 apoptotic activity, including Bax, Bak, Bad and Bok. The other proteins, including Bcl
   2, Bcl-xl and Mcl-1, are anti-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 protein family. The pro
   apoptotic proteins, such as Bax and Bak, permeabilize the outer mitochondrial
   membrane, leading to efflux of cytochrome C, which binds with the adaptor Apaf-1
   and initiator caspase-9 to form the apoptosome. This apoptosome complex can
10 stimulate caspase-9, thereby initiating apoptotic caspase cascades. In other words,
   activation of initiator caspases can trigger a cascade to activate downstream
   executioner caspases, which subsequently cleave proteins that will ultimately lead to
   the apoptosis, such as, membrane blebbing, apoptotic body formation and DNA
   condensation fragmentation. Activated caspase-9 then cleaves and activates the
15 downstream adaptor caspases, such as caspase-3, caspase-6 and caspase-7, which
   function as effector or "executioner" caspases, cleaving various substrates including
   cytokeratins, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and others, that ultimately cause
   the morphological and biochemical changes seen in apoptotic cells. The increased
   Bad/Bcl-xl and Bax/Bcl-2 ratios can trigger apoptosis, too.
20
   Turning to the invention, referring to the results obtained from western blot assay in
   Figs. 6a and 6c, the treatment with the combination of dFdC and Compound A for 24
   h effectively induced the PARP activation and there was an increase in the levels of
   cleaved-PARP. The expression level of caspase-3 was down-regulated, so did the
25 cleaved-caspase-7. In addition, the decreased expression of both caspase-9 and its
   cleaved protein were observed in A549 cells after the combination treatment. The
   data also demonstrate that the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio significantly increases in combination
   treated group (Figs. 6b and 6d). Taken all together, these results indicate that the
   combination of dFdC and Compound A triggers cleavage of PARP and caspase family
30 through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
   Referring back to Fig. 5, the extrinsic pathway is initiated by the interaction of ligands
   with their respective death receptors, sequentially leading to cleavage of initiator
   caspase-8 and caspase-10. Then, they activate the effector caspases 3, 6 and 7. On
35 the other hand, activation of caspase-8 mediates processing of Bid. The truncated Bid

                                           - 21
   subsequently stimulated Bax and Bak to engage the intrinsic pathway. The effector
   caspases can then feedback to promote further caspase 8 processing. These findings
   reveal that caspases 3, 6 and 7 are adaptor caspases which can be activated by
   caspase-9 or caspase-8 in the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, respectively. Figs. 6a
 5 and 6c show that caspase-8 expression level was not significantly different under the
   combination treatment of dFdC and Compound A. These results suggest that dFdC
   combined with Compound A can induce apoptosis in A549 cells via intrinsic pathway
   rather than the extrinsic pathway.
