                                        FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]            The present invention relates to methods for treating of tumor metastasis, as well as
methods for preventing, inhibiting, and predicting tumor metastasis. The invention further relates to
treating angiogenesis-dependent diseases and disorders, screening methods for tumor cell derived anti
angiogenic factors and methods for cancer prognosis evaluation.
                                  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]            The spread of cancer cells from a primary tumor site to distant organs is known as
metastasis. The progression of human cancer to metastatic disease is the major contributing factor to its
lethality. Metastasis has been considered one of the most intriguing aspects of the pathogenesis of cancer.
Cancer tumor metastasis, or otherwise known as metastatic disease, is responsible for most therapeutic
failures in treating the disease, as patients succumb to the multiple tumor growth, accounting for more
than 90% of human cancer related deaths. See, for example, Cancer, A Comprehensive Treatise, F. F.
Becker (editor), Volume 4, Chapter 3, Plenum Press, New York, 1975.
[0004]            In order for a tumor to form lethal metastases it must acquire the ability to carry out a
complex series of steps. These steps include: gaining access to the vasculature or lymphatic system
(intravasation), surviving during transit, exiting the vascular or lymphatic channels (extravasation), and
proliferating at the metastatic site. One of the rate limiting steps in the proliferation of tumors, both at the
primary and metastatic sites, is the acquisition of the angiogenic phenotype (Folkman, 1971). The
induction of angiogenesis not only allows tumors to grow beyond the size limitation imposed by the
diffusion limit of oxygen, but also provides a conduit through which the tumor cells can travel and
colonize distant organs (Brown et al., 1999; MacDougall and Matrisian, 1995). Once the tumor cells
arrive at the metastatic site they must also induce neovascularization in order to grow beyond a
microscopic size. It has been documented, however, that metastatic colonies can remain in a microscopic
or dormant state and not progress beyond this size for months or years following the initial colonization
(Fidler, 2003).
[0005]            The presence of dormant or micro-metastases indicates that tumor growth and
proliferation is not governed solely by cell-autonomous processes and that the conditions present in the
microenvironment that permitted proliferation at the primary site can not exist at the metastatic site.
Thus, the ability of a tumor to communicate with the surrounding stroma, composed of fibroblasts,
immune cells and endothelium must be reestablished upon arrival at the metastatic site. One way in
which heterotypic tumor-stromal signaling could affect tumor growth is through the regulation of the
                                                    1

    WO 2011/084685                                                                PCT/US2010/061007
production and secretion of pro- and anti-angiogenic proteins by the surrounding stromal fibroblasts and
endothelial cells.
[0006]            The molecular and genetic events that facilitate escape from the primary site and homing
to the metastatic site have been well studied. It has been demonstrated in a murine model of breast
cancer metastasis that escape from the primary site was largely dependent on the activity of the
transcription factor Twist (Yang et al., 2004). Furthermore, microarray analyses of metastatic human
breast cancer cells, derived by serial injection into immuno-compromised mice, revealed sets of genes
whose expression correlated with their preferred metastatic destination of bone or lung (Kang et al.,
2003; Minn et al., 2005). These studies, though yielding key insights into two critical steps of tumor
metastasis, namely intravasation and homing, did not address the requirements for tumor establishment
and growth at the metastatic site.
[0007]            It has been previously demonstrated that tumor cells can stimulate the expression of the
pro-angiogenic protein VEGF in the surrounding stroma (Dong et al., 2004; Fukumura et al., 1998).
However, the regulation of Thrombospondin (Tsp-1), one of the most potent endogenous anti-angiogenic
proteins, in the tumor-associated stroma have not been as well studied (Kalas et al., 2005).
[0008]            New research into the cell-to-cell signaling events between metastatic tumors and their
surrounding stroma can yield novel strategies for treating metastatic disease. There is still a need for
methods of treating metastatic disease that have less systemic toxicity than the current standard
treatments comprising chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.
                                    SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0009]            In cancer patients, tumor and micrometastases can remain for prolonged periods of time
in a dormant asymptomatic state before diagnosis and development of disease. Embodiments of the
present invention are based in part on the discovery that a peptide fragment from the protein Saposin A
stimulates the expression of thrombospondin (Tsp-1) in the surrounding environment of the tumor cells,
namely the stroma comprised of fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Tsp-i is also activated in distant
environments such as the lymph nodes. Saposin A is made as a precursor polypeptide prosaposin (Psap).
Tsp-i is a potent endogenous anti-angiogenic factor, and its activation by the tumor-derived protein is via
the activation of the tumor suppressor p53. P53 is a transcriptional activator of Tsp-i. The present
discovery is contrary to current scientific literature wherein prosaposin and its metabolite derivative
saposin C is a potent growth factor for promoting prostate cancer.
[0010]            The inventors have discovered that two smaller fragments derived from saposin A can
potently stimulate and induce Tsp-I expression (see Example 15, Figs. 21A and 22) and reduced
angiogenesis. These include a 20-mer LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI (SEQ. ID. No. 29) and a 13-mer
CDWLPKPNMSASC (SEQ. ID. No. 37).
[0011]            Accordingly, embodiments of the invention provide for an isolated peptide consisting
essentially of at least ten consecutive amino acid residues from the sequence
LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI (SEQ. ID. No. 29) or a conservative substitution variant thereof. In

                           DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0097]           Embodiments of the present invention are based on the discovery that non- or weakly
metastatic tumor cells secrete a protein that stimulates the expression of thrombospondin (Tsp-1) in the
surrounding environment of the tumor cells, namely the stroma comprised of fibroblasts and endothelial
cells. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the increase in expression of Tsp-I in the stroma keeps
the tumor cells from metastasizing. Tsp-I is a potent endogenous anti-angiogenic factor, and the
stimulation of Tsp-i expression by the tumor-derived protein is via the activation of the tumor suppressor
p53. The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription activator of Tsp-i expression. This tumor-associated
                                                    11

    WO 2011/084685                                                                PCT/US2010/061007
protein secreted by non- or weakly metastatic tumor cells is prosaposin (Psap). In addition, the inventors
have found that two peptide fragments from Saposin A, Saposin A being a cleavage product of Psap.
These two peptide fragments CDWLPKPNMSASC (SEQ. ID. No. 37) and
LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI (SEQ. ID. No. 29) were also capable of stimulating Tsp-I expression in
vitro and in vivo.
[0098]            It was found that non- or weakly metastatic tumor cells express a high amount of Psap
and Tsp-i, in addition to stimulating p53 and Tsp-i expression in the surrounding tumor stroma. In
contrast, metastatic tumor cells express low amounts of Psap and Tsp-i, and metastatic tumor cells also
repress the expression of p53 and Tsp-i in the tumor stroma. There is a strong correlation between
metastasis, Psap and Tsp-I expression in the tumor cells, and Psap and Tsp-I expression in the tumor
stroma. In addition, there is also a strong correlation between metastasis and the Psap level in the plasma
and/or platelets of patients with metastatic cancers. Both the plasma and platelets of patients with non
metastatic cancers contained elevated levels of Psap compared to normal individuals not diagnosed with
cancers. In contrast, the plasma and platelets of patients with metastatic cancers contain Psap levels that
are comparable to normal individuals with no diagnosed cancers. While not wishing to be bound by
theory, the shift from elevated levels of Psap levels to normal or lower than normal Psap levels indicates
the transition from non-metastatic to metastatic cancer.
[0099]            While not wishing to be bound by theory, high expression of Psap from a dormant
primary tumor prevents the tumor from metastasis and also prevents the establishment secondary tumors
at sites away from the primary tumor site. Conversely, low or no expression Psap in a primary tumor
allows the tumor to metastasize and establish secondary tumors at sites far away from the primary tumor
site. The Psap secreted by a tumor affects its local and distant environment via paracrine and endocrine
signaling mechanisms, affecting whether a tumor cell can grow bigger and/or implant and grow at a
different and distant location from the primary tumor site. Psap functions as a repressor of both lymphatic
and vascular metastasis by inducing p53 and consequently Tsp-I expression in stromal fibroblasts via
both paracrine and endocrine signaling mechanisms.
[0100]            These new discoveries are contrary to existing reports that Psap and/or its known active
molecular derivatives (e.g., saposin C) function as a pluripotent growth factor with diverse biological
activities that favor malignant phenotypes in prostate cancer (Koochekpour S, et al., J Cell Biochem.
2007,101:631-41; J Cell Biochem. 2008, 104(6):2272-85).
[0101]            In cancer patients, tumor and micrometastasis can remain for prolonged periods of time
in a dormant asymptotic state before diagnosis and development of disease. It is unknown how this
dormant state is maintained or how and why the dormant tumor changes to a metastatic form. This
discovery of Psap expression by dormant tumors explains how the dormant non-metastatic tumor state
can be maintained. Moreover, changes in Psap expression can account for how and why the dormant
tumor changes to a metastatic form. Therefore, measurements of Psap in organism can provide valuable
                                                   12

[0102]            Prosaposin (Psap) is the saposin precursor protein made up of approximately 524-527
amino acids which includes a 16 amino acids signal peptide. The full-length precursor 53-kDa
polypeptide undergoes co-translational glycosylation and modification in the endoplasmic reticulum and
Golgi system to yield a 70-72 kDa precursor protein. After transport to the lysosome, cathepsin D
participates in its proteolytic processing to yield intermediate molecular forms of 35 to 53 kDa and then
to a 13-kDa glycoprotein and finally to the mature 8-11 kDa partially glycosylated forms of individual
saposin molecules (O'Brien J. S., and Kishimoto Y, The FASEB J., 5: 301-8, 1991; Kishimoto Y. et al.,
J. Lipid Res. 33:1255-67, 1992). There are currently three known splice variants of the precursor protein;
isoforms a, b and c.
[0103]            Psap and the individual saposin proteins are expressed by a wide variety of cells types
originating from ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal germ layers including but not limited to lung,
skin, fibroblast, stromal cells, bone, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, placenta, red and
white blood cells, pancreas, placenta, lymphoreticular system (spleen, thymus, liver), micro and
macrovascular system, genitourinary system (e.g., prostate, testes, seminal vesicle), central and
peripheral nervous system. Prosaposin and saposins are also present as soluble proteins in extracellular
space/fluid including pleural fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, seminal fluid, milk, and serum (Campana WM., et
al., 1999; Kishimoto Y. et al., 1992).
[0104]            Psap is overexpressed in breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, non small-cell lung
adenocarcinoma, neuroblastoma, and schwannoma cell lines, glioma cell lines, adult and pediatric brain
tumors (e.g., medulloblastoma-, astrocytoma-, glioblastoma multiforme-cell lines), fibrosarcoma,
osteosarcoma, and prostate cancer cell lines, different types of tumors (brain, colon, lung, pancreas,
rectum, ovary, parotid, skin, bladder, small intestine, thymus, and uterus), including human prostate
cancer cell lines. However the overall the expression and biofunctional significances of prosaposin and
saposins in cancer are largely unknown (Koochekpour S. March 2006; Koochekpour S. September 2006).
[0105]            In the cell, prosaposin is a dual function molecule; as the precursor of intracellular
lysosomal saposin proteins involved in sphingolipid hydrolysis activity and as a secreted soluble protein
with neurotrophic activities, including growth, development, and maintenance of the peripheral and
central nervous system, nerve regeneration and plasticity, stimulation of neurite outgrowth, stimulation of
neuroblastoma cells proliferation, protection from cell-death or apoptosis, and activation of MAPK- and
PI3K/Akt-signaling pathways (Morales and Badran, 2003; Misasi R, et al., 2001; Campana WM, et al.,
1998; Hiraiwa M, et al., 1997; Hiraiwa M, et al., 1997; Kotani Y., et al., 1996; Campana WM., et al.,
1996; O'Brien JS., et al., 1995; O'Brien JS., et al., 1994). The use of prosaposin and its cytokine-derived
peptide in neurite growth and cell myelination is described in US Pat. No. 5700909.

[0106]            As used herein, the term "stroma" or "tumor stroma" refers to the connective tissue
framework and non-tumor cells of a tumor. Examples of some non-tumor cells found in a tumor stroma
are fibroblasts and endothelial cells.
[0107]            As used herein, the term "tumor" means a mass of transformed cells that are
characterized, at least in part, by containing angiogenic vasculature. The transformed cells are
characterized by neoplastic uncontrolled cell multiplication which is rapid and continues even after the
stimuli that initiated the new growth has ceased. The term "tumor" is used broadly to include the tumor
parenchymal cells as well as the supporting stroma, including the angiogenic blood vessels that infiltrate
the tumor parenchymal cell mass. Although a tumor generally is a malignant tumor, i.e., a cancer having
the ability to metastasize (i.e., a metastatic tumor), a tumor also can be nonmalignant (i.e., non-metastatic
tumor). Tumors are hallmarks of cancer, a neoplastic disease the natural course of which is fatal. Cancer
cells exhibit the properties of invasion and metastasis and are highly anaplastic.
[0108]            As used herein, the term "metastases" or "metastatic tumor refers to a secondary tumor
that grows separately elsewhere in the body from the primary tumor and has arisen from detached,
transported cells, wherein the primary tumor is a solid tumor. The primary tumor, as used herein, refers to
a tumor that originated in the location or organ in which it is present and did not metastasize to that
location from another location.
[0109]            As used herein, a "malignant tumor" is one having the properties of invasion and
metastasis and showing a high degree of anaplasia. Anaplasia is the reversion of cells to an immature or a
less differentiated form, and it occurs in most malignant tumors.
[0110]            As used herein, the term "recurrence" of an angiogenic disease or disorder refers to the
re-manifestation/re-development of known symptoms associated with the angiogenic disease or disorder
after previous successful treatment of the angiogenic disease or disorder. For example, a "recurrence" of
a tumor refers to the enlargement of an existing tumor whose growth had stopped or reduced during an
anti-cancer therapy, or the emergence of a tumor at the original (primary) site of tumor discovery after
the original tumor had been excised or reduced in size. The recurrence of a tumor can also mean new
tumor growth(s) of the same tumor type as the original tumor at a site different from the original site of
tumor discovery. This can be an indication that the original primary tumor has spread to other locations,
or the primary tumor has emerged as an anti-angiogenic resistant form. For example, a recurrence of
rheumatoid arthritis can include localized swelling/ pain/ joint stiffness, and elevated leukocyte
ingression after a period of disease remission and symptom free.
[0111]            As used herein, the term "inhibit" or "inhibition" means the reduction or prevention of
tumor growth and /or tumor metastasis in cancers. Inhibition includes slowing the rate of tumor growth
and metastasis. The tumor growth rate can be reduced by about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%,
about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 100%, about 125%, about 150% or more
compared to a control, untreated tumor of the same type. Inhibition also means a reduction in the size of
the tumor of at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least
                                                   14

70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 100% or more compared to a control, untreated tumor of the
same type. The prevention of tumor growth and /or metastasis means no further increase in the size of the
tumors from the time of start of treatment administration. Prevention also means status quo of no new
metastatic tumors detected (i.e., no further spread of cancer) and/or an increase amount of tumor markers
detected by methods known in the art.
[0112]             As used herein, the term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to the amount that is
safe and sufficient to prevent or delay the development and further spread of metastases in cancer
patients. The amount can also cure or cause the cancer to go into remission, slow the course of cancer
progression, slow or inhibit tumor growth, slow or inhibit tumor metastasis, slow or inhibit the
establishment of secondary tumors at metastatic sites, or inhibit the formation of new tumor metastasis.
[0113]             The term "treat" or "treatment" refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or
preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent, slow down, and/or halt the development or
spread of cancer. Beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of
symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or
slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether
partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. "Treatment" can also mean prolonging survival as
compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those
already diagnosed with cancer as well as those likely to develop secondary tumors due to metastasis.
[0114]             The term "angiogenesis", as used herein refers to the sprouting of new blood vessels
from pre-existing blood vessels, characterized by endothelial cell proliferation and migration triggered by
certain pathological conditions, such as the growth of solid tumors and metastasis.
[0115]             As used herein, the term "angiogenesis-dependent disease or disorder" refers to diseases
or disorders that are dependent on a rich blood supply and blood vessel proliferation for the disease
pathological progression (e.g., metastatic tumors) or diseases or disorders that are the direct result of
aberrant blood vessel proliferation (e.g., diabetic retinopathy and hemangiomas). Examples include
abnormal vascular proliferation, ascites formation, psoriasis, age-related macular degeneration, thyroid
hyperplasia, preeclampsia, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, Alzheimer's disease, obesity, pleural
effusion, atherosclerosis, endometriosis, diabetic/other retinopathies, ocular neovascularizations such as
neovascular glaucoma and corneal neovascularization.
[0116]             As used herein, the term "nucleic acid" refers to DNA or RNA. The term encompasses
sequences that include any of the known base analogs of DNA and RNA.
[0117]             The term "vector", as used herein, refers to a nucleic acid construct comprising the
complete or partial cDNA of Psap (SEQ. ID. No. 2, 4, or 6) (Genbank Accession No. NM_002778,
NM_001042466, or NM_001042465), wherein the nucleic acid construct is designed for delivery to a
host cell, transfer between different host cells, or for the expression of Psap or functional fragments or
variants thereof, in cells. As used herein, a vector can be viral or non-viral.

[0118]            As used herein, the term "viral vector," refers to a nucleic acid vector construct that
includes at least one element of viral origin and includes elements sufficient for or permissive of
packaging into a viral vector particle. A viral vector can contain the coding sequence for a Psap protein in
place of non-essential viral genes. The vector and/or particle can be utilized for the purpose of
transferring DNA, RNA or other nucleic acids into cells either in vitro or in vivo. Numerous forms of
viral vectors are known in the art.
[0119]            As used herein, the term "prognosis" encompasses predictions and likelihood analysis of
disease progression, particularly tumor recurrence, metastatic spread, and disease relapses. The
prognosis method described herein is intended for clinical use in making decision concerning treatment
modalities, including therapeutic interventions, diagnostic criteria such as disease staging, and disease
monitoring and surveillance for metastasis or recurrence of neoplastic disease.
[0120]            As used herein, a "tissue sample" refers to a portion, piece, part, segment, or fraction of a
tissue which is obtained or removed from an intact tissue or organ of a subject, preferably a human
subject.
[0121]            As used herein, a "subject" refers to a mammal, preferably a human. The term
"individual", "subject", and "patient" are used interchangeably.
[0122]            As used herein, a "tumor sample" refers to a portion, piece, part, segment, or fraction of
a tumor, for example, a tumor which is obtained or removed from a subject (e.g., removed or extracted
from a tissue of a subject), preferably a human subject.
[0123]            As used herein, the term "functional" refers to the fragments and variants of Psap protein
having cellular functions substantially similar to that of the parent full-length Psap. At the minimum,
"functional" refers to the capability of stimulating Tsp-i and/or p53 expressions. In other embodiments,
other cellular functions including capability of being glycosylated, of being proteolytically processed to
give the smaller saposins which are required for the hydrolysis of glycosphingolipids by lysosomal
lysozmes, ability to bind to membrane lipids, and have neurotrophic activities.
[0124]            As used herein, the term "substantially similar" refers to no change to the course of
direction of biological effects resulting from the actions of the fragments and variants of Psap in the cell.
For example, the fragment and variant forms of Psap are still capable of stimulating Tsp-i and p53
expression and activation, and they can still be processed proteolytically to give saposins, and these
saposins can be used by the cell in the hydrolysis of glycosphingolipids. A "substantially similar"
functional fragment of saposin A has an amino acid sequence differing from SEQ. ID. No. 13 by having
one or more conservative amino acid substitution and/or modification but is still capable of stimulating
Tsp-i and p53 expressions and activation, the methods of assaying are described herein and are well
known in the art.
[0125]            As used herein, the term "variant" refers the splice variant of Psap protein (also known
as isoforms) encoded by the nucleic acids of Psap (Genbank Accession No. NM_002778, SEQ. ID. No.
2), NM_001042465 (SEQ. ID. No. 4), or NM_001042466 (SEQ. ID. No. 6)). In one embodiment,
                                                   16

    WO 2011/084685                                                                  PCT/US2010/061007
"variant" also refers to Psap protein or molecule modified at one or more base pairs, codons, introns,
exons, or amino acids, respectively, yet still retain the biological activity and cellular functions of a Psap
protein, e.g., a conservative substitution variant where one or more of the amino acids have been
substituted with their respective conservative amino acid but the variant still retain the ability to stimulate
Tsp-i expression. Thus the polypeptide sequence of the variant Psap protein is slightly different from that
prescribed by the Psap coding nucleic acid (SEQ. ID. No. 2, 4, and 6). There are one or more amino acid
mutations in the Psap protein. Conservative amino acid substitution can produced variant Psap proteins.
For example, the amino acid serine can be substituted for threonine and the amino acid aspartate can be
substituted for glutamate. The variant Psap proteins have comparable or greater Tsp-I and p53 expression
stimulation activity than the parent Psap protein. The variant Psap protein can have at least 80%, at least
90 %, at least 100%, at least 110%, at least 120%, at least 130%, at least 140%, or at least 150% of the
Tsp-i and p53 expression stimulation activity of the parent Psap protein. Variants can be produced by a
number of means including methods such as, for example, error-prone PCR, shuffling, oligonucleotide
directed mutagenesis, recursive ensemble mutagenesis, exponential ensemble mutagenesis, site-specific
mutagenesis, gene reassembly, GSSM and any combination thereof.
[0126]            As used herein, the term "conservative amino acid substitution" is one in which the
amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a side chain with a similar charge.
Families of amino acid residues having side chains with similar charges have been defined in the art.
These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side
chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine,
glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine,
isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains ( e.g., threonine,
valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine).
[0127]            As used herein, the term "fragment" refers to an amino acid sequence which is shorter
than the original polypeptide encoded by the cDNA of Psap (Genbank Accession No. NM_002778, SEQ.
ID. No. 2), NM_001042465.1 (SEQ. ID. No. 4) or NM_001042466.1 (SEQ. ID. No. 6) thus presenting
an incomplete Psap protein. The Psap protein is shortened or truncated. The term "functional fragment"
as used herein refers to the truncated Psap protein that has cellular functions including the stimulation of
Tsp-i and p53 expression. Fragments are at least 10 amino acids but are not the full-length Psap protein.
In other words, fragments are 10 amino acids or more but are not the full-length Psap protein. Examples
of fragments include fragments consisting of amino acids 1-300, amino acids 1-150, and amino acids 1
490 of the original full length Psap protein. These fragments contain the Saposin A- and Saposin B
domains and can be cleaved to give the smaller saposins or smaller fragments thereof. For example:

[0128]            The terms "polypeptide" and "peptide" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a
polymer of amino acids. These terms do not connote a specific length of a polymer of amino acids. Thus,
for example, the term includes oligomeric peptides, made up of two or more physically linked peptides,
whether produced using recombinant techniques, chemical or enzymatic synthesis, or naturally occurring.
This term also includes polypeptides that have been modified or derivatized, such as by glycosylation,
acetylation, phosphorylation, and the like.
[0129]            As used herein, the term "Psap protein" refers to the splice variant full-length human
prosaposin isoform A preproprotein (Genbank Accession Nos.: NM_002778 (SEQ. ID. No. 2),
NP_002769.1 (SEQ. ID. No. 1)); UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot P07602, UniProtKB/TrEMBL Q53Y86), the

the secreted forms of these splice variants, functional fragments and conservative substitution variants
thereof that are greater or equal to 10 amino acid residues, the functional fragments and variants of the
isoforms that are greater or equal to 10 amino acid residues, differentially glycosylated forms of the full
length splice variant Psap protein, secreted differentially glycosylated forms of the Psap protein,
differentially glycosylated functional fragments with less than 524 amino acids and that are greater or
equal to 10 amino acid residues, and/or differentially glycosylated functional variants thereof. Psap
protein includes substantially similar Psap proteins, saposin A and functional fragments thereof that are
greater or equal to 10 amino acid residues.
[0130]            As used herein, the term "differentially glycosylated" refers to differences in
glycosylation at the available glycosylation sites of full-length Psap. There are five glycosylation sites on
                                                  18

the full-length protein. Accordingly, a full-length Psap can have anywhere from zero and up to five
glycosylated groups. In addition, the term also refers to the presence of different sugar groups on the
polypeptide.
[0131]            As used herein, the term "cancer" refers to any of various malignant neoplasms
characterized by the proliferation of anaplastic cells that tend to invade surrounding tissue and
metastasize to new body sites as well as to the pathological conditions characterized by such malignant
neoplastic growths. The term "cancer" also refers to cells and tissue with neoplasms characteristics of
anaplastic proliferation that are not invasive of surrounding tissue, i.e., anaplastic cells that are benign.
[0132]            As used herein, the term "promptness" refers to any time within one month of positive
laboratory test results confirming presence of cancer cells.
[0133]            As used herein, the phrase "development of cancer" or "cancer development" refers to
the development of primary or initial cancer, the development of metastasis from benign and/or
malignant tumors, and/or the development of malignancy from benign tumors.
[0134]            As used herein, the term "fusion protein" or "fusion polypeptide" refers to a protein
created by joining two heterologous genes or two heterologous proteins / peptides or portions thereof
together. By "heterologous" in reference to genes and proteins means the genes or proteins are two
different and not similar entities. For example, two heterologous genes encode for two different and not
similar proteins respectively. Thus, a "fusion protein" or "fusion polypeptide" is a chimeric protein, made
of at least two different types of proteins or portions thereof. In the laboratory, "fusion protein" or "fusion
polypeptide" is achieved through the creation of a fusion gene which is done through the removal of the
stop codon from a DNA sequence of the first protein and then attaching the DNA sequence of the second
protein in frame. The resulting DNA sequence can then be expressed by a cell as a single protein.
Alternatively, in a fusion protein, the two heterologous proteins can be joined together with a linker or
spacer peptide added between the two proteins. This linker or spacer peptide often contains protease
cleavage site(s) to facilitate the separation of the two different proteins after expression and purification.
The making of fusion protein as a technique is commonly used for the identification and purification of
proteins through the fusion of a GST protein, FLAG peptide or a hexa-His peptide.
[0135]            As used herein, a peptide linker is a short sequence of amino acids that is not part of the
sequence of either of the two peptides being joined to form a fusion protein or fusion polypeptide. A
peptide linker is attached on its amino-terminal end to one polypeptide or polypeptide domain and on its
carboxyl-terminal end to another polypeptide or polypeptide domain. Examples of useful linker peptides
include, but are not limited to, glycine polymers ((G)n) including glycine-serine and glycine-alanine
polymers (e.g., a (Gly4Ser)n repeat where n=1-8, preferably, n=3, 4, 5, or 6). The peptide linker can be a
flexible linker, in that the peptide sequence does not adopt any secondary structures known in proteins,
e.g., alpha helices. Such flexible linkers are predominantly made of non-charged, apolar amino acid
residues and are hydrophobic. Secondary protein structures can be determined by methods known in the
art, for example, circular dichroism. An example of a flexible peptide linker is LGGGGSGGGGSA
                                                    19

(SEQ. ID. No. 41). Alternately, the peptide linker can take the form a monomeric hydrophilic a-helix, for
example, AEAAAKEAAAKEA (SEQ. ID. No. 42).
[0136]            By "PEGylated" is meant the covalent attachment of at least one molecule of
polyethylene glycol to a biologically active molecule. The average molecular weight of the reactant PEG
is preferably between about 3,000 and about 50,000 daltons, more preferably between about 10,000 and
about 40,000 daltons, and most preferably between about 15,000 and about 30,000 daltons. Particularly
preferred are PEGs having nominal average sizes of about 20,000 and about 25,000 daltons. The method
of attachment is not critical, but preferably does not alter, or only minimally alters, the activity of the
biologically active molecule. Preferably the increase in half-life is greater than any decrease in biological
activity. A preferred method of attachment is via N-terminal linkage to a polypeptide or peptide.
[0137]            In one respect, the term "comprising" in reference to the herein described compositions
and methods, refers to respective component(s) thereof, as essential to the invention, yet open to the
inclusion of unspecified elements, essential or not.
[0138]            In some embodiments, other elements that can be included in the description of the
composition, method or respective component thereof are limited to those that do not materially affect
the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the invention. This is referred to using the term "consisting
essentially of'. This applies equally to steps within a described method as well as compositions, peptides
and components therein. In other embodiments, the inventions, peptides, compositions, methods, and
respective components thereof, described herein are intended to be exclusive of any element not recited
with respect to that composition, element, component or method. This is referred to using the term
"consisting of'.
[0139]            In some embodiments, the term "essential" in reference to compositions and methods
refers to the "essential" component in the composition or method being the peptide or protein sequence
that, at the minimum, has the ability to stimulate Tsp-I expression in the assays described herein,
preferably also stimulate p53 expression. Non essential component in the composition or method would
be heterologous protein that is not Psap, fusion portion of the fusion protein that is not Psap, PEG,
polymer, immunoglobulin Fc region or conjugates etc.
[0140]            The term "reducing the likelihood" in reference to the development of certain conditions
refers to a reduction by at least 20% compared to when no treatment or administration of a
therapeutically effective amount of a Psap protein or a vector described herein. The reduction can also be
at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least
100%, including all the percent between 20% and 100%.
[0141]            In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating an angiogenesis
dependent disease or disorder, the method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a
therapeutically effective amount of a Psap protein or a vector comprising the nucleic acid encoding a
Psap protein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

[0142]            In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of inhibiting the recurrence of an
angiogenesis-dependent disease or disorder, the method comprising administering to a subject in need
thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of a Psap protein or a vector comprising the nucleic acid
encoding a Psap protein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
[0143]            The angiogenesis-dependent disease or disorder is selected from, but is not limited to, a
group consisting of cancer, ascites formation, psoriasis, age-related macular degeneration, thyroid
hyperplasia, preeclampsia, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, Alzheimer's disease, obesity, pleural
effusion, atherosclerosis, endometriosis, diabetic/other retinopathies, neovascular glaucoma, age-related
macular degeneration (ARMD), hemangiomas, and corneal neovascularization.
[0144]            In one embodiment, the angiogenesis-dependent disease or disorder is cancer, where the
rapidly dividing neoplastic cancer cells require an efficient blood supply to sustain their continual growth
of the tumor. As used herein, cancer refers to any of various malignant neoplasms characterized by the
proliferation of anaplastic cells that tend to invade surrounding tissue and metastasize to new body sites
and also refers to the pathological condition characterized by such malignant neoplastic growths. The
blood vessels provide conduits to metastasize and spread elsewhere in the body. Upon arrival at the
metastatic site, the cancer cells then work on establishing a new blood supply network. Administration
of Psap proteins and/or the overexpression of Psap proteins lead to the activation of the potent
angiogenesis inhibitor Tsp-i in the tumor stroma. By inhibiting angiogenesis at the primary tumor site
and secondary tumor site, embodiments of the invention serve to halt, prevent and limit the progression
of the disease. Any solid tumor that requires an efficient blood supply to keep growing is a candidate
target. For example, candidates for the treatment described herein include carcinomas and sarcomas
found in the anus, bladder, bile duct, bone, brain, breast, cervix, colon/rectum, endometrium, esophagus,
eye, gallbladder, head and neck, liver, kidney, larynx, lung, mediastinum (chest), mouth, ovaries,
pancreas, penis, prostate, skin, small intestine, stomach, spinal marrow, tailbone, testicles, thyroid and
uterus. The types of carcinomas include papilloma/carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, endodermal sinus tumor,
teratoma, adenoma/adenocarcinoma, melanoma, fibroma, lipoma, leiomyoma, rhabdomyoma,
mesothelioma, angioma, osteoma, chondroma, glioma, lymphoma/leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma,
small cell carcinoma, large cell undifferentiated carcinomas, basal cell carcinoma and sinonasal
undifferentiated carcinoma. The types of sarcomas include soft tissue sarcoma such as alveolar soft part

[0145]           In one embodiment, the angiogenesis-dependent disease or disorder is age-related
macular degeneration. It is known that VEGF contributes to abnormal blood vessel growth from the
choroid layer of the eye into the retina, similar to what occurs during the wet or neovascular form of age
related macular degeneration. Macular degeneration, often called AMD or ARMD (age-related macular
degeneration), is the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in Americans aged 65 and older. New
blood vessels grow (neovascularization) beneath the retina and leak blood and fluid. This leakage causes
permanent damage to light-sensitive retinal cells, which die off and create blind spots in central vision or
the macula.
[0146]           In one embodiment, the angiogenic disease or disorder is diabetic retinopathy- abnormal
blood vessel growth associated with diabetic eye diseases. The activation of Tsp-i via prosaposin serves
to antagonize VEGF, a substance naturally produced in the body that promotes blood vessel formation.
Released by the retina (light-sensitive tissue in back of the eye) when normal blood vessels are damaged
by tiny blood clots due to diabetes, VEGF turns on its receptor, igniting a chain reaction that culminates
in new blood vessel growth. However, the backup blood vessels are faulty; they leak, bleed and
encourage scar tissue that detaches the retina, resulting in severe loss of vision. Such growth is the
hallmark of diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among young people in developed
countries. In one embodiment, the subject in need of treatment can be a mammal, such as a dog or a cat,
preferably a human.
[0147]           In one embodiment, the angiogenesis-dependent disease or disorder is rheumatoid
arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by synovial tissue swelling, leucocyte ingress and
angiogenesis, or new blood vessel growth. The disease is thought to occur as an immunological response
to an as yet unidentified antigen. The expansion of the synovial lining of joints in rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) and the subsequent invasion by the pannus of underlying cartilage and bone necessitate an increase
in the vascular supply to the synovium, to cope with the increased requirement for oxygen and nutrients.
Angiogenesis is now recognised as a key event in the formation and maintenance of the pannus in RA
(Paleolog, E. M., 2002). Even in early RA, some of the earliest histological observations are blood
vessels. A mononuclear infiltrate characterizes the synovial tissue along with a luxuriant vasculature.
Angiogenesis is integral to formation of the inflammatory pannus and without angiogenesis; leukocyte
ingress could not occur (Koch, A. E., 2000). Disruption of the formation of new blood vessels would not
only prevent delivery of nutrients to the inflammatory site, it could also reduce joint swelling due to the
additional activity of VEGF, a potent pro-angiogenic factor in RA, as a vascular permeability factor.
[0148]           In one embodiment, the angiogenesis-dependent disease or disorder is Alzheimer's
disease. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. AD is
characterized by an excessive cerebral amyloid deposition leading to degeneration of neurons and
eventually to dementia. The exact cause of AD is still unknown. It has been shown by epidemiological
studies that long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins, histamine H2-receptor
blockers, or calcium-channel blockers, all of which are cardiovascular drugs with anti-angiogenic effects,

    WO 2011/084685                                                                  PCT/US2010/061007
seem to prevent Alzheimer's disease and/or influence the outcome of AD patients. Therefore, it has been
speculated that in AD angiogenesis in the brain vasculature may play an important role in AD. In
Alzheimer's disease, the brain endothelium secretes the precursor substrate for the beta-amyloid plaque
and a neurotoxic peptide that selectively kills cortical neurons. Moreover amyloid deposition in the
vasculature leads to endothelial cell apoptosis and endothelial cell activation which leads to
neovascularization. Vessel formation could be blocked by the VEGF antagonist SU 4312 as well as by
statins, indicating that anti-angiogenesis strategies can interfere with endothelial cell activation in AD
(Schultheiss C., el. al., 2006; Grammas P., et al., 1999) and can be used for preventing and/or treating
AD.
[0149]            In one embodiment, the angiogenesis-dependent disease or disorder is obesity. It has
been shown that the angiogenesis inhibitor, TNP-470 was able to prevent diet-induced and genetic
obesity in mice (Ebba Brikenhielm et al., Circulation Research, 2004, 94:1579). TNP-470 reduced
vascularity in the adipose tissue, thereby inhibiting the rate of growth of the adipose tissue and obesity
development.
[0150]            In one embodiment, the angiogenesis-dependent disease or disorder is endometriosis.
Excessive endometrial angiogenesis is proposed as an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of
endometriosis (Healy, DL., et al., 1998). The endometrium of patients with endometriosis shows
enhanced endothelial cell proliferation. Moreover there is an elevated expression of the cell adhesion
molecule integrin vB3 in more blood vessels in the endometrium of women with endometriosis when
compared with normal women. Strategies that inhibit angiogenesis can be used to treat endometriosis.

[0152]            In one embodiment, the method of treating cancer is administered promptly after the
detection of cancer. As used herein, promptness refers to any time within one month of positive
laboratory test results confirming presence of cancer cells. Diagnosis and detection of cancer cells are
well known to one skilled in the art. Laboratory tests can be in the form of histology and/or biomarkers
that are known in the art but are not limited to these examples. Some laboratory tests include testing for
cancer biomarkers such as cancer antigen (CA) 15-3, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and HER-2 for
breast cancer, human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 oncoproteins for cervical cancer, alpha
fetoprotein (AFP), AFP fractions L3, P4/5, and the +11 band, and ultrasonography for hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer, and serum CA-125 for ovarian and
HCC. Tissue biopsy and histology are usually performed for confirmation and tissue typing of the
original of cancer cell type.

saposin A and the peptides are greater that or equal to 10 amino acid residues long but is not saposin A
(SEQ. ID. No. 13). For example, a composition can comprise of CDWLPKPNMSASC (SEQ. ID. No.

[0194]              In some embodiments, the compositions comprise a multimer of peptides or fragments,
wherein the peptides are identical and wherein the plurality of peptides is derived from saposin A. For
example, a plurality of CDWLPKPNMSASC (SEQ. ID. No. 37) only or LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI
(SEQ. ID. No. 29) only.
[0195]              In some embodiments, the multimer of peptides are concatamerically linked. The
physical joining of a plurality of peptides by a molecular linker results in an oligomer of peptides. The
composition can comprise an oligomeric peptide that is a dimer of two peptides, a trimer of three
peptides, a tetramer of four peptides, or a pentamer of five peptides. In a preferred embodiment, the
oligomeric peptide is a dimer of two peptides and/or a trimer of three peptides. In one embodiment, the
oligomeric peptide is a homo-oligomeric peptide, comprising identical peptides according to the
invention disclosed herein. Hetero-oligomeric peptides comprising different peptides, fragments, and/or
variants thereof that are greater than or equal to 10 amino acid residues are also contemplated.
[0196]              In one embodiment, the molecular linker that joins the peptides to form an oligomeric
peptide can be a peptide linker molecule or a chemical linker. The peptide linker molecule can comprise
e.g., at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more amino acids residues and preferably less that 50 amino acids
residues.
[0197]              In one embodiment, the composition can also include the monomeric peptide along with
oligomeric peptide. It is contemplated that all possible combinations of monomeric, dimeric, trimeric,
tetrameric, and pentameric peptides, and homo-oligomeric peptides as well as hetero-oligomeric peptides
can be included in the compositions described herein.
[0198]              In one embodiment, the molecular linker used for forming the oligomeric polypeptides is
a peptide linker molecule. In one embodiment, the peptide linking molecule comprises at least one amino
acid residue which links at least two peptides according to the invention. The peptide linker comprises,
e.g., at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more amino acids residues and preferably less that 50 amino acids
residues. The peptide linking molecule can couple polypeptides or proteins covalently or non-covalently.
Typical amino acid residues used for linking are glycine, tyrosine, cysteine, lysine, glutamic and aspartic
acid, or the like. A peptide linker is attached on its amino-terminal end to one peptide, polypeptide or
polypeptide domain (e.g., a C-peptide) and on its carboxyl-terminal end to another peptide, polypeptide
or polypeptide domain (again, e.g., a C-peptide). Examples of useful linker peptides include, but are not
limited to, glycine polymers ((G)n) including glycine-serine and glycine-alanine polymers (e.g., a
(Gly4Ser)n repeat where n=1-8, preferably, n=3, 4, 5, or 6). Other examples of peptide linker molecules
are described in US Patent No. 5,856,456 and are hereby incorporated by reference.

    WO 2011/084685                                                                  PCT/US2010/061007
[0199]           In another embodiment, the molecular linker is a chemical linker such as linkages by
disulfide bonds between cysteine amino acid residues or by chemical bridges formed by amine
crosslinkers, for example, glutaraldehyde, bis(imido ester), bis(succinimidyl esters), diisocyanates and
diacid chlorides. Extensive data on chemical cross-linking agents can be found at INVITROGEN's
Molecular Probe under section 5.2.
[0200]           In one embodiment, the oligomeric peptide can be made by linking individual isolated
peptides. The individual peptides can be made by chemical methods known in the art or by recombinant
methods also known in the art. For recombinant methods, the DNA coding sequence of a peptide can be
made by amplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specially designed PCR primers that
incorporate restriction enzyme digestion sites and/or extra spacer or tag amino acid residues can be used
to facilitate DNA ligation, recombinant protein expression, and protein purification. In order to facilitate
linking of the peptides together, additional amino acid residues can be added, by way of the DNA coding
sequence, to the peptides. For example, the thiol-group containing amino acid cysteine and the amine
group containing amino acid lysine can be added. The thiol-group and the amine group provide reactive
groups useful for cross-kinking reactions. In one embodiment, the additional amino acids are added at the
ends of the peptides. The extra amino acids can be engineered into the coding sequence using standard
recombinant molecular biology methods that are known in the art. In addition, extra amino acids that
constitute a tag can be added to facilitate peptide expression and purifications. Examples of such tags
include the thioredoxin first 105 amino acids, the tandem six histidine-tag, HA-tag, and the flag-tag. An
example of such a peptide with terminally added cysteine groups and histidine (6X) purification tag.
[0201]           The DNA coding sequences of the different individual peptides can be ligated into
expression vectors which are then transfected into appropriate expression host cells and induced to
express the recombinant peptide. Subsequently, the expressed recombinant peptide can be purified and
then used in cross-linking to form the dimeric, trimer, tetrameric, or pentameric oligomeric peptide
compositions described herein by methods known in the art.
[0202]           In the instance where the peptide contains no available reactive thiol-group for chemical
cross-linking, several methods are available for introducing thiol-groups into proteins and peptides,
including but not limited to the reduction of intrinsic disulfides, as well as the conversion of amine or
carboxylic acid groups to thiol group. Such methods are known to one skilled in the art and there are
many commercial kits for that purpose, such as from Molecular Probes division of Invitrogen Inc. and
Pierce Biotechnology.
[0203]           In another embodiment, the oligomeric peptide can be made by recombinant methods
without the need for linking individual isolated peptides by chemical cross linking. Recombinant
methods can be use to synthesize a single coding DNA sequence that comprises the several coding
sequences of a peptide. For example, two and up to five peptide coding sequences are ligated in tandem.
Additional amino acid coding sequences, coding for, e.g., 2-10 amino acids, can be added between each
pair of adjoining peptides as spacer sequences. When the single coding DNA is transcribed and
                                                  32

    WO 2011/084685                                                                  PCT/US2010/061007
translated, the expressed polypeptide can contain tandem repeats of peptides, each separated by, e.g., 2
10 extra amino acids. Typical amino acid residues used for spacing sequences are glycine, tyrosine,
cysteine, lysine, proline, glutamic and aspartic acid, or the like. In a preferred embodiment, the
oligomeric peptide is expressed in an amino-carboxyl-amino-carboxyl tandem configuration. Similarly,
the oligomeric peptide synthesized can include a tag amino acid sequence for facilitating oligomeric
peptide expression, identification and purifications. Such recombinant methods are well known to one
skilled in the art.
[0204]             In some embodiments, the complex of oligomeric peptides or monomeric peptides are
modified by NH2 -terminal acylation, e.g., acetylation, or thioglycolic acid amidation, by terminal
carboxylamidation, e.g., with ammonia, methylamine, and the like terminal modifications that are known
in the art. Terminal modifications are useful to reduce susceptibility by proteinase digestion, and
therefore serve to prolong half life of the peptides in solutions, particularly biological fluids where
proteases may be present.
[0205]             In one embodiment, the peptide described herein, e.g., LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI
(SEQ. ID. No. 29), CDWLPKPNMSASC (SEQ. ID. No. 37) or a conservative substitution variant
thereof, is linked or fused to an amino acid sequence or a polymer that enhances the serum half life.
[0206]             In one embodiment, the peptide described herein, e.g., LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI
(SEQ. ID. No. 29), CDWLPKPNMSASC (SEQ. ID. No. 37) or a conservative substitution variant
thereof, is linked or fused to an amino acid sequence that facilitates protein expression and/or purification
of the first portion.

(SEQ. ID. No. 29), CDWLPKPNMSASC (SEQ. ID. No. 37) or a conservative substitution variant
thereof, is linked or fused to a therapeutic molecule.
[0208]             Methods of linking a peptide to an amino acid sequence or a polymer can be by chemical
cross-linking or by recombinant methods which are well known in the art and are described herein.
[0209]             In one embodiment, the peptide described herein, e.g., LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI
(SEQ. ID. No. 29), CDWLPKPNMSASC (SEQ. ID. No. 37) or a conservative substitution variant
thereof, is a cyclic peptide. Cyclic peptides (or cyclic proteins) are polypeptide chains whose amino and
carboxyl termini are they linked together with a peptide bond or other covalent bond, forming a circular
chain. In one embodiment, the peptide contains amino and carboxyl terminal cysteine amino acid
residues. Cysteines facilitate S-S disulphide bond formation. In one embodiment, the peptide contains
additional cysteine amino acid residues, wherein the cysteine amino acid residues are near the termini but
not necessarily at the very end. In some embodiments, the cysteine amino acid residues are within the
five amino acid residues at the termini of the peptide. e.g., LEKTCDWLPKPNMSACA (SEQ. ID. No.
43) or a conservative substitution variant thereof. Methods of design and synthesis of cyclic peptides are
well known in the art, e.g., as described in U. S. Patent Nos. 5.596.078; 5.990.273; 7,589,170 and U. S.

methods and techniques for the synthesis of a cyclic saposin A peptide described herein.
[0210]             In one embodiment, the peptide described herein, whether monomeric, oligomeric or
cyclic, is PEGylated. PEGylation is the process of covalent attachment of Polyethylene glycol polymer
chains to another molecule, normally a drug or therapeutic protein. PEGylation is routinely achieved by
incubation of a reactive derivative of PEG with the target macromolecule. The covalent attachment of
PEG to a drug or therapeutic protein can "mask" the agent from the host's immune system (reduced
immunogenicity and antigenicity), and increase the hydrodynamic size (size in solution) of the agent
which prolongs its circulatory time by reducing renal clearance. PEGylation can also provide water
solubility to hydrophobic drugs and proteins. PEGylation, by increasing the molecular weight of a
molecule, can impart several significant pharmacological advantages over the unmodified form, such as:
improved drug solubility, reduced dosage frequency, without diminished efficacy with potentially
reduced toxicity, extended circulating life, increased drug stability, and enhanced protection from
proteolytic degradation. In addition, PEGylated drugs are have wider opportunities for new delivery
formats and dosing regimens. Methods of PEGylating molecules, proteins and peptides are well known in
the art, e.g., as described in U. S. Patent No. 5,766,897; 7,610,156; 7,256,258 and the International
Application No. WO/1998/032466.

6,884,780, and 7,022,673, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.
[0253]            In one embodiment, the invention provides an isolated chimeric polypeptide comprising
a first portion and a second portion, wherein the first portion is saposin A (SEQ. ID. No. 13) or a
functional fragment thereof, and the second portion comprises an amino acid sequence that facilitates
protein expression and/or purification of the first portion. The second portion is not a Psap protein, and

[0257]            In some embodiments, the second portion is not a Psap protein, and the first portion is
capable of activating p53 and inducing Tsp-i expression. In one embodiment, the first portion is
conjugated to a therapeutic molecule. In one embodiment, the therapeutic molecule is an anti-angiogenic
therapeutic molecule, e.g., angiostatin and endostatin. Numerous anti-angiogenic therapeutic molecules
are known in the art, including but not limited to bevacizumab sunitinib, thalidomide, lenalidomide and
sorafenib. In one embodiment, the therapeutic molecule is an anti-VEGF agent. In another embodiment,
the therapeutic molecule can be a toxin, a radiotherapy molecule or anti-cancer drug such as thalidomide
and lenalidomide. Again, numerous anti-angiogenic therapeutic molecules are known in the art.

conservative amino acid substitution variant thereof can be fused with other anti-angiogenic factors
and/or anti-VEGF agent, e.g., angiostatin or endostatin to enhance anti-angiogenic potency. Fusions or
conjugates of such Psap peptides have dual functions: activate p53 and induce Tsp-I expression as well
as anti-angiogenic activity. Methods of determining p53 activating activity and Tsp-i expression
inducing activity are described herein. Determining anti-angiogenic activities are well known to one
skilled in the art, for example by, a chick chorioallantoic membrane assay.
[0258]            In one embodiment, the Psap proteins, peptides, chimeric polypeptides, fusion protein of
saposin A or conservative amino acid substitution variant thereof include modification within the
sequence, such as, modification by terminal-NH 2 acylation, e.g., acetylation, or thioglycolic acid
amidation, by terminal-carboxylamidation, e.g., with ammonia, methylamine, and the like terminal
modifications. Terminal modifications are useful, and are well known, to reduce susceptibility to
proteinase digestion, and therefore serve to prolong half life of the polypeptides in solutions, particularly
biological fluids where proteases may be present.
[0259]            In another embodiment, the methods described herein can be used in combination with
other treatment options available for the angiogenesis-dependent disease or disorder. For example, the
treatment methods described herein can be administered in conjunction with chemotherapy, radiation
therapy, and/or a cytostatic agent. The treatment methods described herein are administered in
conjunction with anti-VEGF or anti-angiogenic factor, and/or p53 reactivation agent. Examples of cancer
chemotherapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, irinotecan (CPT- 11); erlotinib; oxalipatin;
anthracyclins- idarubicin and daunorubicin; doxorubicin; alkylating agents such as melphalan and
chlorambucil; cis-platinum, methotrexate, and alkaloids such as vindesine and vinblastine. A cytostatic
agent is any agent capable of inhibiting or suppressing cellular growth and multiplication. Examples of
cytostatic agents used in the treatment of cancer are paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluorouridine,
mitomycin-C, doxorubicin, and zotarolimus. Other cancer therapeutics includes inhibitors of matrix
metalloproteinases such as marimastat, growth factor antagonists, signal transduction inhibitors and
protein kinase C inhibitors.

[0263]           Methods of determining anti-VEGF activity and/or anti-angiogenesis activity are well
known to one skilled in the art. For example, the human umbilical vein endothelial cell phosphorylation
assay and the VEGF-induced proliferation assay as described by Holash et al., 2002, in Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA, 99:11393-98, can be used to determine the anti-VEGF inhibitory activity of an anti-VEGF
agent and are hereby explicitly incorporated by reference. The human VEGF165 can be used as the
positive control in the cell phosphorylation and proliferation assays. The cell phosphorylation assay
detects tyrosine phosphorylation which is an indicator of the activation of the VEGF signaling pathway.
The proliferation assay detects cell proliferation induced by the activation of the VEGF signaling
pathway. An anti-VEGF agent that blocks the activation of the VEGF signaling pathway will give
reduced tyrosine phosphorylation and reduced cell proliferation in these assays compared to the results
when the human VEGF165 is used as a positive control.
[0264]           In yet another embodiment, the methods described herein are administered in
conjunction with a p53 reactivation agent. Around half of all human tumors carry p53 mutations, mostly
point mutations that abrogate p53's specific DNA binding and transactivation activity. p53 mutation is
associated with poor therapeutic response and prognosis. Tumors that carry wild type p53 often have
other alterations in the p53 pathway that ablate the p53 tumor suppression response. Several strategies
have been designed to restore p53 function in human tumors, including p53 gene therapy, reactivation of
mutant p53, and activation of wild type p53 by inhibition of the p53 antagonist MDM2. In all cases, the
aim is to eliminate the tumor through induction of massive apoptosis (Bykov VJ and Wiman KG. 2003).
[0265]           A p53 reactivation agent is any organic or inorganic chemical, compound, including
protein and nucleic acid molecule that can restore the p53 response of a tumor cell. The p53 reactivation
agent can be a gene therapy agent, such as a vector, carrying a wild-type p53 gene for reconstitution into
tumor cells with deletions in the p53 gene, that is, introduction of an intact cDNA copy of the p53 gene
using a suitable viral vector, typically one based on adenovirus (Adp53) (Wiman, 2006) or ADVEXIN
                                                  44

    WO 2011/084685                                                                PCT/US2010/061007
(Introgen Inc.). The end result is to have functional p53 protein expression in the tumor cells. Functional
p53 will perform the tumor suppression activities that are well known in the art.
[0266]            Some cancer cells carry the wild-type p53 gene and should express theoretically
functional p53 protein yet tumor growth is not regulated by the expressed p53 (Gurova, et al., 2004). It is
speculated that p53 is somehow deactivated. A frequent observation in wild-type p53 gene carrying
tumors is the overexpression of MDM2. The deactivation of p53 has been shown to be the result of
MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and the deregulation of HDM-2, which binds to p53 and targets it
for proteasomal degradation. The deactivation of p53 has been shown to be also mediated by suppression
of NF-KB activity as it was shown that p53 tumor suppressor activity was restored by ectopic expression
of a super-repressor of IKB such as 9-aminoacridine (9AA), its derivatives, and the anti-malaria drug
quinacrine (Gurova, et al., 2004). P53 reactivation agents that activate p53 by blocking the p53/MDM2
and the p53/HDM-2 protein-protein interactions to prevent p53 degradation are MDM-2 inhibitors and
HDM-2 inhibitors. Some examples include a group of imidazoline compounds dubbed Nutlins (Vassilev
LT et al., 2004) which fit neatly into the small pocket where MDM-2 contacts p53 and prevent the
interaction between the two proteins.
[0267]            Mutant p53 proteins have point mutations that abrogate p53's specific DNA binding and
transactivation activity. These mutant p53 often fold abnormally and thus lose the ability to regulate their
target genes. New small molecules that help these mutant p53 proteins fold more normally have been
successful in reactivating the mutant p53 protein. Examples are the novel compounds RITA (Issaeva N.,
et al., 2004; Espinoza-Fonseca LM. 2005), the related PRIMA-I and MIRA-1 (Rehman, A. 2005), and
CP-31398 (Tanner S and Barberis A., 2004; Ho CK and Li G., 2005). For tumors with mutations in p53
that abolish the DNA binding activity in p53, a p53 reactivation agent can be one that facilitates DNA
binding of the mutant p53 thus enabling the mutant p53 to function again as an activator of transcription.
An example of such a p53 reactivation agent is described in Roth, J. et al., 2003, where a chimeric
adaptor protein made of the DNA-binding and tetramerizing portions of the p53-homologue p73 (i.e.,
having tumor suppressive effects) fused to the oligomerization domain of p53 enables the mutant p53 to
bind to its respective p53 response elements and initiate apoptosis. In addition, drugs that mimic p 5 3 's
effects in activating gene transcription are also contemplated. Furthermore, agents that increase the
production, expression, and/or stability of p73, the p53 homologue, can also be used in combination with
the methods described herein. The increase of p73 production, expression, and/or stability in tumor cells
serves to promote apoptosis.
[0268]            In yet another embodiment, the methods described herein are administered in
conjunction with therapeutics, physiotherapy and/or behavioral psychotherapy used in the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis, obesity, endometriosis, and Alzheimer's disease.
[0269]            For examples of treatments of rheumatoid arthritis, there are therapeutic drugs that
decrease pain and local inflammation including aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or
NSAIDS (such as ibuprofen or naproxen) and other immunosuppressive drugs that decrease pain and
                                                   45

inflammation while decreasing the growth of abnormal synovial tissue (the tissue that lines the inside of
the joint). These drugs include methotrexate and low doses of corticosteroids (such as prednisone or
cortisone). Other medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis include: anti-malarial medications (such
as hydroxychloroquine), gold, sulfasalazine, penicillamine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine,
minocycline, and interleukin receptor antagonist and anti-112 antibodies.
[0270]           Treatment for Alzhemier's disease include, but are not be limited to, nonsteroidal anti
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), estrogen, steroids such as prednisone, vitamin E, menantine, donepezil,
rivastigmine, tacrine, and galantamine. Holistic medicine include example such as gingko nuts extracts.
[0271]           Treatment of endometrosis include, but should not be construed as limited to, a
combination oral contraceptives (estrogen plus a progestin), progestins (such as medroxyprogesterone,
danazol (a synthetic hormone related to testosterone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH
agonists-such as buserelin, goserelin, leuprolide and nafarelin), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) for pain control.
[0272]           Examples of treatment options for obesity include dieting and nutritional counseling,
exercise regime, gastric-bypass surgery, and drugs such as a combination of fenfluramine and
phentermine (often called fen-phen), orlistat, sibutramine, phentermine, benzphetamine, diethylpropion,
mazindol, and phendimetrazine.
Functional peptides
[0273]           Functional peptides of saposin A can be chemically synthesized and purified by
biochemical methods that are well known in the art such as solid phase peptide synthesis using t-Boc
(tert-butyloxycarbonyl) or FMOC (9-flourenylmethloxycarbonyl) protection group described in "Peptide
synthesis and applications" in Methods in molecular biology Vol. 298, Ed. by John Howl and "Chemistry
of Peptide Synthesis" by N. Leo Benoiton, 2005, CRC Press, (ISBN-13: 978-1574444544) and
"Chemical Approaches to the Synthesis of Peptides and Proteins" by P. Lloyd-Williams, et al., 1997,
CRC-Press, (ISBN-13: 978-0849391422). Solid phase peptide synthesis, developed by R. B. Merrifield,
1963, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85 (14): 2149-2154, was a major breakthrough allowing for the chemical
synthesis of peptides and small proteins. An insoluble polymer support (resin) is used to anchor the
peptide chain as each additional alpha-amino acid is attached. This polymer support is constructed of 20
50 pm diameter particles which are chemically inert to the reagents and solvents used in solid phase
peptide synthesis. These particles swell extensively in solvents, which makes the linker arms more
accessible.
[0274]           Organic linkers attached to the polymer support activate the resin sites and strengthen the
bond between the (-amino acid and the polymer support. Chloromethyl linkers, which were developed
first, have been found to be unsatisfactory for longer peptides due to a decrease in step yields. The PAM
(phenylacetamidomethyl) resin, because of the electron withdrawing power of the acid aide group on
the phenylene ring, provides a much more stable bond than the classical resin. Another alternative resin
                                                  46

    WO 2011/084685                                                                 PCT/US2010/061007
for peptides under typical peptide synthesis conditions is the Wang resin. This resin is generally used
with the FMOC labile protecting group.
[0275]            A labile group protects the alpha-amino group of the amino acid. This group should be
easily removed after each coupling reaction so that the next alpha-amino protected amino acid may be
added. Typical labile protecting groups include t-Boc and FMOC t-Boc is a very satisfactory labile group
which is stable at room temperature and easily removed with dilute solutions of trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA) and dichloromethane. FMOC is a base labile protecting group which is easily removed by
concentrated solutions of amines (usually 20-55% piperidine in N-methylpyrrolidone). When using
FMOC alpha-amino acids, an acid labile (or base stable) resin, such as an ether resin, is desired.
[0276]            The stable blocking group protects the reactive functional group of an amino acid and
prevents formation of complicated secondary chains. This blocking group must remain attached
throughout the synthesis and may be removed after completion of synthesis. When choosing a stable
blocking group, the labile protecting group and the cleavage procedure to be used should be considered.
[0277]            After generation of the resin bound synthetic peptide, the stable blocknig groups are
removed and the peptide is cleaved from the resin to produce a "free" peptide. In general, the stable
blocking groups and organic linkers are labile to strong acids such as TFA. After the peptide is cleaved
from the resin, the resin is washed away and the peptide is extracted with ether to remove unwanted
materials such as the scavengers used in the cleavage reaction. The peptide is then frozen and lyophilized
to produce the solid peptide. This is then characterized by HPLC and MALDI before being used. In
addition, the peptide should be purified by HPLC to higher purity before use.
[0278]            Commercial peptide synthesizing machines are available for solid phase peptide
synthesis. For example, the Advanced Chemtech Model 396 Multiple Peptide Synthesizer and an
Applied Biosystems Model 432A Peptide synthesizer. There are commercial companies that make
custom synthetic peptide to order, e.g., Abbiotec, Abgent, AnaSpec Global Peptide Services, LLC.,
INVITROGENTM and rPeptide, LLC.
Synthesis of Psap proteins
[0279]            Functional fragments of Psap or saposin A, functional variants and functional peptide
mimetics thereof and fusion proteins thereof can also be synthesized and purified by molecular methods
that are well known in the art. Preferably molecular biology methods and recombinant heterologous
protein expression systems can be used. For example, recombinant protein may be expressed in bacteria,
mammal, insects, yeast, or plant cells.
[0280]            The Psap proteins can be synthesized and purified by protein and molecular methods that
are well known in the art. Preferably molecular biology methods and recombinant heterologous
eukaryotic protein expression systems are used. An example of expression and purification of the human
prosaposin is described in Gopalakrishnan, M. M., et al., 2004 and in US Pat. No. 5,700,909. The
purification of rat prosaposin is described in Morales, CR., 1998. These references are hereby
                                                  47

    WO 2011/084685                                                                  PCT/US2010/061007
incorporated by reference in their entirety. The approach can be applied to the purification of human
Psap proteins by one skilled in the art.
[0281]            Standard techniques known to those of skill in the art can be used to introduce mutations
in the nucleotide sequence encoding prosaposin, including, for example, site-directed mutagenesis and
PCR-mediated mutagenesis which result in amino acid substitutions. Preferably, the variants encode less
than 50 amino acid substitutions, less than 40 amino acid substitutions, less than 30 amino acid
substitutions, less than 25 amino acid substitutions, less than 20 amino acid substitutions, less than 15
amino acid substitutions, less than 10 amino acid substitutions, less than 5 amino acid substitutions, less
than 4 amino acid substitutions, less than 3 amino acid substitutions, or less than 2 amino acid
substitutions relative to the prosaposin protein.
[0282]            A "conservative amino acid substitution" is one in which the amino acid residue is
replaced with an amino acid residue having a side chain with a similar charge. Families of amino acid
residues having side chains with similar charges have been defined in the art. These families include
amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid,
glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine,
tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine,
methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side
chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Alternatively, mutations can be introduced
randomly along all or part of the coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, error-prone PCR,
shuffling, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, recursive ensemble mutagenesis, exponential ensemble
mutagenesis, site-specific mutagenesis, gene reassembly, GSSM and any combination thereof. The
resultant mutants can be screened for Tsp-i and p53 expression stimulating activity by the assays
described herein to identify mutants that retain or have enhanced Tsp-i and p53 expression stimulating
activity.
[0283]            Methods of assaying the effects of mutant, fragment or variant Psap on Tsp-i and p53
expression are described herein. Briefly, full-length, mutant, fragment and variant Psap are applied to the
cell cultures prostate fibroblast. The conditioned media from PC3M-LN4 (LN4) and PC3 cells are used
as controls, with PC3 as positive/stimulating control and LN4 as negative/inhibiting controls. After a
period of included (-16 h), the cells are harvested, rinsed, and lysed. The lysates are analyzed for the
level of Tsp-i and p53 expression by western blot analyses, with P-actin as the internal lysate protein
loading control.
[0284]            Functional fragments of Psap are incomplete proteins of Psap and will therefore have
less than the 524 amino acids in the polypeptide. The full-length polypeptide can be truncated at the
amino terminus or the carboxyl terminus or at both ends. The polypeptide can also have an internal
deletion of the amino acids such as the deletion of the SapB or SapA coding regions. Preferably, the
functional fragments has less than 50 amino acid deletion, less than 40 amino acid deletion, less than 30
amino acid deletion, less than 25 amino acid deletion, less than 20 amino acid deletion, less than 15
                                                  48

     WO 2011/084685                                                                PCT/US2010/061007
amino acid deletion, less than 10 amino acid deletion, less than 5 amino acid deletion, less than 4 amino
acid deletion, less than 3 amino acid deletion, or less than 2 amino acid deletion, relative to the parent
Psap protein.
[0285]             As used herein, the Tsp-I and p53 expression stimulating activity refers to Psap protein's
ability to induce an increase in the expression levels of Tsp-I and p53 in surrounding tumor stroma or
fibroblast cells. The stimulating activity also includes the effects on tumor and non-tumor cells.
[0286]             The introduced mutations can be silent or neutral missense mutations, i.e., have no, or
little, effect on Psap protein's Tsp-I and p53 expression stimulating activity. These types of mutations
can be useful to optimize codon usage, or improve recombinant Psap protein expression and production.
Alternatively, non-neutral missense mutations can alter Psap protein's ability to stimulate Tsp-I and p53
expression. One of skill in the art would be able to design and test mutant molecules for desired
properties such as no alteration of Psap protein's ability to stimulate Tsp-i and p53 expression.
Following mutagenesis, the encoded protein can routinely be expressed and the functional and/or
biological activity of the encoded protein, (e.g., ability to stimulate Tsp-I and p53 in tumor-derived
fibroblasts) can be determined using techniques described herein or by routinely modifying techniques
known in the art.
[0287]             Embodied in the invention is a vector carrying a cDNA encoding prosaposin, or coding
cDNA fragments of prosaposin. Conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloning techniques can
be used to generate the complete cDNA sequence, using, e.g., the PCR primers: 5'

expression stimulating activity, or can be subcloned into protein expression vectors or viral vectors for
protein synthesis in a variety of protein expression systems using host cells selected from the group
consisting of mammalian cell lines, insect cell lines, yeast, and plant cells. In the example below, Cre
recombinase to move the cDNA's into pCMVneo for expression.
[0289]            Examples of other expression vectors and host cells are the pET vectors (Novagen),
pGEX vectors (Amersham Pharmacia), and pMAL vectors (New England labs. Inc.) for protein
expression in E. coli host cell such as BL21, BL21(DE3) and AD494(DE3)pLysS, Rosetta (DE3), and
Origami(DE3) (Novagen); the strong CMV promoter-based pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and pCIneo vectors

pastoris and vectors pMETc and pMET for expression in P. methanolica; pYES2/GS and pYDI
(Invitrogen) vectors for expression in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Recent advances in the large
scale expression heterologous proteins in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are described by Griesbeck C. et
al., 2006 Mol. Biotechnol. 34:213-33 and Fuhrmann M. 2004, Methods Mol Med. 94:191-5. Foreign
heterologous coding sequences are inserted into the genome of the nucleus, chloroplast and mitochondria
by homologous recombination. The chloroplast expression vector p64 carrying the most versatile
chloroplast selectable marker aminoglycoside adenyl transferase (aadA), which confer resistance to
spectinomycin or streptomycin, can be used to express foreign protein in the chloroplast. Biolistic gene
gun method is used to introduce the vector in the algae. Upon its entry into chloroplasts, the foreign DNA
is released from the gene gun particles and integrates into the chloroplast genome through homologous
recombination.
[0290]            Specific site-directed mutagenesis of Psap cDNA sequence in a vector can be used to
create specific amino acid mutations and substitutions. Site-directed mutagenesis can be carried out using
the QUIKCHANGE® site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene according to manufacture's
instructions or any method known in the art.
[0291]            In one embodiment, provided herein are expression vectors carrying the Psap cDNA that
encodes prosaposin or fragments, derivatives, or variants thereof for the expression and purification of
the recombinant Psap proteins produced from a eukaryotic protein expression system using host cells
selected from the group consisting of mammal, insects, yeast, or plant cells.
[0292]            Specifically contemplated in the methods described herein are fusion Psap proteins. For
example, Psap protein can be fused to transferrin, IgG, or albumin, to name a few, to enhance serum half
life and pharmacokinetics in the individual being treated. Psap protein can also be fused to a tag protein
such as tandem histidine residues (6xHis), GST, myc, thioredoxin first 105 amino acids or HA tag for the
purification and/or enhance solubility of the expressed recombinant protein in heterologous system.
Enzymatic digestion with serine proteases such as thrombin and enterokinase cleave and release the Psap
protein from the histidine or myc tag, releasing the recombinant Psap protein from the affinity resin while
the histidine-tags and myc-tags are left attached to the affinity resin. Other reasons for tagging the Psap
protein include monitoring the distribution of the protein over time in the individual, since the tagged
Psap is distinguishable from the native Psap protein.
[0293]            In one embodiment, the recombinant vector that expresses prosaposin is a viral vector.
The viral vector can be any viral vector known in the art including but not limited to those derived from
adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), retrovirus, and lentivirus. Recombinant viruses provide a
versatile system for gene expression studies and therapeutic applications.
[0294]            A simplified system for generating recombinant adenoviruses is presented by He TC. et
al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA     95:2509-2514, 1998. The gene of interest is first cloned into a shuttle
vector, e.g., pAdTrack-CMV. The resultant plasmid is linearized by digesting with restriction
endonuclease Pme I, and subsequently co-transformed into E. coli. BJ5183 cells with an adenoviral
                                                  51

    WO 2011/084685                                                                    PCT/US2010/061007
backbone plasmid, e.g., pAdEasy-1 of Stratagene's AdEasyTM Adenoviral Vector System. Recombinant
adenovirus vectors are selected for kanamycin resistance, and recombination confirmed by restriction
endonuclease analyses. Finally, the linearized recombinant plasmid is transfected into adenovirus
packaging cell lines, for example HEK 293 cells(E 1-transformed human embryonic kidney cells) or 911
(El-transformed human embryonic retinal cells) (Human Gene Therapy 7:215-222, 1996). Recombinant
adenoviruses are generated within the HEK 293 cells.
[0295]             In one embodiment, provided herein is a recombinant lentivirus for the delivery and
expression of prosaposin protein in either dividing or non-dividing mammalian cells. The HIV- 1 based
lentivirus can effectively transduce a broader host range than the Moloney Leukemia Virus (MoMLV)
base retroviral systems. Preparation of the recombinant lentivirus can be achieved using the pLenti4/V5
DESTTM, pLenti6/V5-DESTTM or pLenti vectors together with ViraPowerTM Lentiviral Expression
systems from Invitrogen.
[0296]             In one embodiment, the invention provides a recombinant adeno-associated virus
(rAAV) vector for the expression of a prosaposin protein. In one embodiment, the rAAV vector
encoding a prosaposin protein is administered to slow, inhibit, or prevent the growth of cancer and
tumors such as glioma. Using rAAV vectors, genes can be delivered into a wide range of host cells
including many different human and non-human cell lines or tissues. Because AAV is non-pathogenic
and does not elicit an immune response, a multitude of pre-clinical studies have reported excellent safety
profiles. rAAVs are capable of transducing a broad range of cell types, and transduction is not dependent
on active host cell division. High titers, > 108 viral particles/mil, are easily obtained in the supernatant and
1011 -1012 viral particles/ml can be obtained with further concentration. The transgene is integrated into
the host genome so expression is long term and stable.
[0297]             The use of alternative AAV serotypes other than AAV-2 (Davidson et al (2000), PNAS
97(7)3428-32; Passini et al (2003), J. Virol 77(12):7034-40) has demonstrated different cell tropisms and
increased transduction capabilities. With respect to brain cancers, the development of novel injection
techniques into the brain, specifically convection enhanced delivery (CED; Bobo et al (1994), PNAS
91(6):2076-80; Nguyen et al (2001), Neuroreport 12(9):1961-4), has significantly enhanced the ability to
transduce large areas of the brain with an AAV vector.
[0298]             Large scale preparation of AAV vectors is made by a three-plasmid cotransfection of a
packaging cell line: AAV vector carrying the Psap DNA coding sequence, AAV RC vector containing
AAV rep and cap genes, and adenovirus helper plasmid pDF6, into 50 x 150 mm plates of subconfluent
293 cells. Cells are harvested three days after transfection, and viruses are released by three freeze-thaw
cycles or by sonication.
[0299]             AAV vectors are then purified by two different methods depending on the serotype of
the vector. AAV2 vector is purified by the single-step gravity-flow column purification method based on
its affinity for heparin (Auricchio, A., et al., 2001, Human Gene therapy 12:71-6; Summerford, C. and R.

Samulski, 1998, J. Virol. 72:1438-45; Summerford, C. and R. Samulski, 1999, Nat. Med. 5: 587-88).
AAV2/1 and AAV2/5 vectors are currently purified by three sequential CsCl gradients.
Therapeutic compositions and administration
[0300]             In one embodiment, the invention provides for a pharmaceutical composition comprising
prosaposin, functional fragments or variants thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In
another embodiment, the invention also provides for a pharmaceutical composition comprising the
expression vector carrying the cDNA that encodes prosaposin, functional fragments or variants thereof
and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
[0301]             As used herein, the term "pharmaceutical composition" refers to the Psap proteins in
combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition does not
include tissue culture media, water, and serum.
[0302]             When used in mammalian therapy, the therapeutic composition of the invention can be
administered in any convenient vehicle that is physiologically acceptable. The compounds can be
formulated for a variety of modes of administration, including systemic, topical or localized
administration. Techniques and formulations generally can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical
Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., latest edition. In each case, a therapeutically effective
amount of Psap, functional fragments or variants, or vector comprising the cDNA encoding Psap or
fragments or variants thereof is administered in order to prevent or inhibit the progression of the
angiogenesis-dependent disease or disorder. The Psap, functional fragments or variants, or vector
comprising a cDNA encoding Psap or fragments or variants thereof are generally combined with a carrier
such as a diluent or excipient which can include fillers, extenders, binding, wetting agents, disintegrants,
surface-active agents, or lubricants, depending on the nature of the mode of administration and dosage
forms. Typical dosage forms include tablets, powders, liquid preparations including suspensions,
emulsions and solutions, granules, capsules and suppositories, as well as liquid preparations for
injections.
[0303]             For angiogenesis-dependent diseases or disorders that are accessible externally on the
skin, such as dermal hemangiomas and skin cancer lesions (melanoma), gene therapy virus, expression
vectors, or Psap, fragments or variants can be preferably applied topically to the hemangioma or cancer
lesion site in a therapeutically effective amount in admixture with pharmaceutical carriers, in the form of
topical pharmaceutical compositions. The gene therapy virus can be in the form of an adenovirus, adeno
associated virus or lentivirus. Such compositions include solutions, suspensions, lotions, gels, creams,
ointments, emulsions, skin patches, etc. All of these dosage forms, along with methods for their
preparation, are well known in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic art. HARRY'S COSMETICOLOGY
(Chemical Publishing, 7th ed. 1982); REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES (Mack
Publishing Co., 18th ed. 1990). Typically, such topical formulations contain the active ingredient in a
concentration range of 0. 1 to 100 mg/nl, in admixture with suitable vehicles. For gene therapy viruses,
the dosage ranges from 10    6 to 10 14particle per application. Other desirable ingredients for use in such
                                                    53

    WO 2011/084685                                                                    PCT/US2010/061007
preparations include preservatives, co-solvents, viscosity building agents, carriers, etc. The carrier itself
or a component dissolved in the carrier can have palliative or therapeutic properties of its own, including
moisturizing, cleansing, or anti-inflammatory/anti-itching properties. Penetration enhancers can, for
example, be surface active agents; certain organic solvents, such as di-methylsulfoxide and other
sulfoxides, dimethyl-acetamide and pyrrolidone; certain aides of heterocyclic amines, glycols (e.g.,
propylene glycol); propylene carbonate; oleic acid; alkyl amines and derivatives; various cationic,
anionic, nonionic, and amphoteric surface active agents; and the like.
[0304]            Topical administration of a pharmacologically effective amount can utilize transdermal
delivery systems well known in the art. An example is a dermal patch. Alternatively the biolistic gene
gun method of delivery can be used. The gene gun is a device for injecting cells with genetic information,
originally designed for plant transformation. The payload is an elemental particle of a heavy metal coated
with plasmid DNA. This technique is often simply referred to as biolistics. Another instrument that uses
biolistics technology is the PDS-1000/He particle delivery system. The Psap, functional fragments, or
variants, expression vector, and/or gene therapy virus can be coated on minute gold particles, and these
coated particles are "shot" into biological tissues such as hemangiomas and melanoma under high
pressure. An example of gene gun-based method is described for DNA based vaccination of cattle by
Loehr B. I. et al., J. Virol. 2000, 74:6077-86.
[0305]            In one embodiment, the compositions described herein can be administered directly by
intratumoral injection. If the solid tumors and hemangiomas are accessible by injection, the Psap,
functional fragments, or variants, expression vector, and/or viral vector can be administered by injection
directly to the tumor mass as a pharmaceutical formulation. The preferred formulation is also sterile
saline or Lactated Ringer's solution. Lactated Ringer's solution is a solution that is isotonic with blood
and intended for intravenous administration.
[0306]            In the treatment and prevention of diabetic retinopathy and wet macular degeneration,
pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention can be applied to the eye by intra-vitral or
intraocular injection. In one embodiment, the invention can be formulated as an eye drop solution for
direct application on the eyes.
[0307]            In addition to topical therapy, the compositions described herein can also be
administered systemically as a pharmaceutical formulation. Systemic routes include but are not limited
to oral, parenteral, nasal inhalation, intratracheal, intrathecal, intracranial, and intrarectal. The
pharmaceutical formulation is a liquid, preferably in sterile saline, lactated Ringer's or Hank's solution.
In addition, the pharmaceutical formulation can be in solid forms and re-dissolved or suspended
immediately prior to use. Lyophilized forms are also included.
[0308]            For therapeutic applications, the compositions described herein are administered to a
mammal, preferably a human, in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form, including those that can be
administered to a human intravenously as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time, by
intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intracerebrospinal, subcutaneous, intra-arterial, intrasynovial, intrathecal,
                                                    54

    WO 2011/084685                                                                  PCT/US2010/061007
oral, topical, or inhalation routes. The pharmaceutical formulation can be infused upstream from the site
of the cells whose activity is to be modulated. Implantable drug pumps, as for example, INFUSAID®
pumps (Infusaid, Inc.), are useful for delayed-release intraarterial administration. The preferred
embodiment is the intramuscular injection of AAV viral vectors encoding the cDNA of Psap, functional
fragments or variants thereof.
 [0309]            The compositions described herein are also suitably administered by intratumoral,
peritumoral, intralesional or perilesional routes, to exert local as well as systemic effects. The
intraperitoneal route is expected to be particularly useful, for example, in the treatment of ovarian tumors.
For these uses, additional conventional pharmaceutical preparations such as tablets, granules, powders,
capsules, and sprays can be preferentially required. In such formulations further conventional additives
such as binding-agents, wetting agents, propellants, lubricants, and stabilizers can also be required.
 [0310]            In one embodiment, the composition described herein takes the form of a cationic
liposome formulation such as those described for intratracheal gene therapy treatment of early lung
cancer treatment (Zou Y. et al., Cancer Gene Ther. 2000, 7(5):683-96). The liposome formulations are
especially suitable for aerosol use in lung cancer patients. The pharmaceutical formulation can be
contained within a lipid particle or vesicle, such as a liposome or microcrystal, which is also suitable for
parenteral administration. The particles can be of any suitable structure, such as unilamellar or
plurilamellar, so long as Psap, fragments, variants thereof, or vector carrying the cDNA of Psap
fragments, variants thereof are contained therein. Vector DNA and/or virus can be entrapped in
'stabilized plasmid-lipid particles' (SPLP) containing the fusogenic lipid
dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), low levels (5-10 mol%) of cationic lipid, and stabilized by a
polyethyleneglycol (PEG) coating (Zhang Y. P. et al., Gene Ther. 1999, 6:1438-47). Positively charged
lipids such as N-[i-(2,3-dioleoyloxi)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl-amoniummethylsulfate,         or "DOTAP," are
particularly preferred for such particles and vesicles. The preparation of such lipid particles is well
known. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,880,635; 4,906,477; 4,911,928; 4,917,951; 4,920,016; and 4,921,757.
Other non-toxic lipid based vehicle components can likewise be utilized to facilitate uptake of the vector
carrying the cDNA encoding Psap, fragments, or variant thereof by the cell. Other techniques in
formulating expression vectors and virus as therapeutics are found in "DNA-Pharmaceuticals:
Formulation and Delivery in Gene Therapy, DNA Vaccination and Immunotherapy" by Martin Schleef
(Editor) December 2005, Wiley Publisher, and "Plasmids for Therapy and Vaccination" by Martin
Schleef (Editor) Can 2001, are incorporated herein as reference. In one embodiment, the dosage for viral
vectors is 106 to 1 x 1014 viral vector particles per application per patient.
 [0311]            Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means, or the
compounds can be administered orally. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants
appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally
known in the art, and include, for example, bile salts and fusidic acid derivatives for transmucosal
administration. In addition, detergents can be used to facilitate permeation. Transmucosal administration
                                                   55

     WO 2011/084685                                                                  PCT/US2010/061007
can be through use of nasal sprays, for example, as well as formulations suitable for administration by
inhalation, or suppositories. For oral administration, the Psap proteins or vector are formulated into
conventional as well as delayed release oral administration forms such as capsules, tablets, and tonics.
[0312]            The route of administration, dosage form, and the effective amount vary according to the
potency of the Psap proteins, expression vectors and viral vectors, their physicochemical characteristics,
and according to the treatment location. The selection of proper dosage is well within the skill of an
ordinary skilled physician. Topical formulations can be administered up to four-times a day.
[0313]            In one embodiment, dosage forms of the compositions described herein include
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that are inherently non-toxic and non-therapeutic. Examples of such
carriers include ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human
serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial
glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts, or electrolytes such as protamine
sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts,
colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, and
polyethylene glycol. Carriers for topical or gel-based forms of Psap proteins include polysaccharides
such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose or methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylates,
polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wood wax alcohols. For all
administrations, conventional depot forms are suitably used. Such forms include, for example,
microcapsules, nano-capsules, liposomes, plasters, inhalation forms, nose sprays, sublingual tablets, and
sustained release preparations. For examples of sustained release compositions, see U.S. Pat. No.
3,773,919 and 3,887,699, EP 58,481A and EP 158,277A, Canadian Patent No. 1176565, U. Sidman et
al., Biopolymers 22:547 (1983) and R. Langer et al., Chem. Tech. 12:98 (1982). The Psap proteins will
usually be formulated in such vehicles at a concentration of about 0.1 mg/ml to 100 mg/ml and the vector
should be in the range of 106 to 1 x 1014 viral vector particles per application per patient.
[0314]            In one embodiment, other ingredients can be added to the pharmaceutical formulations as
described herein, such as anti-oxidants, e.g., ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about ten
residues) polypeptides, e.g., polyarginine or tripeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or
immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids, such as glycine,
glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or arginine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates
including cellulose or its derivatives, glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; and
sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol.
[0315]            In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation used for therapeutic administration
must be sterile. Sterility is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes (e.g.,
0.2 micron membranes). Alternatively, preservatives can be used to prevent the growth or action of
microorganisms. Various preservatives are well known and include, for example, phenol and ascorbic
acid. The Psap proteins ordinarily will be stored in lyophilized form or as an aqueous solution if it is
                                                  56

    WO 2011/084685                                                                    PCT/US2010/061007
highly stable to thermal and oxidative denaturation. The pH of the Psap proteins preparations typically
will be about from 6 to 8, although higher or lower pH values can also be appropriate in certain instances.
[0316]             The localized concentration or amount administered to a subject can be determined
empirically and will depend upon the purpose of the administration, the area to be treated, the
effectiveness of the composition, and the manner of administration. The localized concentration at the
site of the targeted cells will desirably be in the range of about 0.05 to 50 gM, or more particularly 0.2 to
5 gM, although higher or lower dosages can be employed as appropriate. For administration to a subject
such as a human, a dosage of from about 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg up to 50, 100, or 150 mg/kg or more can
typically be employed.
Treatment applications of the peptides and chimeric polypeptides
[0317]             In one embodiment, the methods described herein provide a method of treating an
individual diagnosed with cancer comprising making a prognosis evaluation based on the levels of Psap
in the tumor sample and tumor stroma, and administering a therapeutically effective amount of Psap
protein or a vector comprising a nucleic acid encoding Psap protein and a pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier if the Psap level is lower than 95% of a reference Psap level and the prognosis is poor.
[0318]             In one embodiment, the methods described herein provide a method of treating an
individual diagnosed with cancer, the method comprising making a prognosis evaluation based on the
levels of Psap in the tumor sample and tumor stroma, and if the Psap level is lower than 95% of a
reference Psap level and the prognosis is poor, administering a therapeutically effective amount of a
composition comprising an isolated peptide and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein the
isolated peptide consists essentially of the sequence CDWLPKPNMSASC (SEQ. ID. No. 37) or
LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI (SEQ. ID. No. 29), wherein the peptide is flanked by 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4
amino acid residues on either terminus or both termini.
[0319]             In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of treating an individual diagnosed with
cancer comprising: (a) determining a level of Psap in a tumor sample from the individual; (b) comparing
the Psap level determined in (a) with a reference Psap level; and when the Psap level determined in (a) is
lower than 95% of said reference Psap level, administering a therapeutically effective amount of a
composition comprising an isolated peptide and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, wherein the
isolated peptide consists essentially of the sequence CDWLPKPNMSASC (SEQ. ID. No. 37)
LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI (SEQ. ID. No. 29) or a conservative substitution variant thereof, or a

[0320]             In another embodiment, the composition comprises a chimeric polypeptide comprising a
first portion and a second portion, wherein the first portion of the chimeric polypeptide is a peptide
consisting essentially of the sequence CDWLPKPNMSASC (SEQ. ID. No. 37),
LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI (SEQ. ID. No. 29) or conservative substitution variant thereof, or is a
peptide consisting essentially of at least ten consecutive amino acid residues of the sequence
LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI (SEQ. ID. No. 29) or conservative substitution variant thereof, wherein
the peptide is flanked by 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 amino acid residues on either terminus or both termini, and
wherein the second portion is not a Psap protein. In some embodiments, the peptide consists essentially
of at least 11, at least 12, at least 13, at least 14, at least 15, at least 16, at least 17, at least 18, or at least
19 consecutive amino acid residues from SEQ. ID. No. 29 or a conservative substitution variant thereof.
[0321]             A reference level of Psap is, for example, that obtained from a control sample of non
tumor, healthy cells in the same tissue type or organ type from which a tumor sample was excised. The
reference Psap level is normalized to 100%.
[0322]             In one embodiment, the reference Psap level is the average of the Psap levels obtained
from a population of healthy individuals and the reference Psap level is normalized to 100%.
[0323]             In one embodiment, the average Psap level from a population of healthy individuals is
for a specific tissue type or organ type, e.g., the liver or lungs. For example, the average Psap level is
from obtained from the liver Psap levels of a population of healthy individuals. The reference Psap level
is normalized to 100%.
[0324]             As used herein, the term "prognosis" is intended to encompass predictions and likelihood
analyses of disease progression, particularly tumor recurrence, metastatic spread and disease relapse.
The prognostic methods of the invention are intended to be used clinically in making decisions
concerning treatment modalities, including therapeutic intervention, diagnostic criteria such as disease
staging, and disease monitoring and surveillance for metastasis or recurrence of neoplastic disease.
[0325]             In one embodiment, the method for prognosis evaluation is carried out on tissue samples
removed from a subject in a surgical procedure, for example, in a biopsy. Preferably, the method is
carried out using human cancer patient tumor samples, or samples from human patients suspected of
having cancer or having abnormal growth or lesions. Various methods of harvesting a tissue sample are
known to those skilled in the art and include, for example, fine needle aspiration, image-guided needle
core aspiration, liposuction, laser capture microdissection, and ultrasound guided needle core aspiration,
to name a few. Preferably, the samples are preserved, for example, in paraffin, and prepared for
histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Alternatively, the samples can be prepared for other
methods of determining and quantifying protein expression levels that are well known in the art. Tissues
samples are often dissolved in TRIZOLTM reagent to prevent the breakdown and to preserve the integrity
of the nucleic acids and proteins. Nucleic acid molecules can then be extracted and isolated from the
TRIZOLTM dissolved sample using any of a number of procedures, which are well-known in the art. For
example, the most common approach is the alcohol salt precipitation of nucleic acids.

[0326]             In one embodiment, the individual is diagnosed with a benign or malignant tumor.
Methods of determining whether a tumor or cancer is metastatic or benign are well known to one skilled
in the art, e.g., measurement of biomarkers such as metalloproteinase pump-I (U. S. Pat. No. 5,726,015),
CAI25, or CEA.
[0327]             In one embodiment, the sample from the individual need not be a tumor sample. In some
embodiments, the sample from the individual is a biopsy tissue sample or a fluid sample such as a blood
sample.
[0328]             In one embodiment, the prognosis evaluation method described herein is not restricted to
the analyses of Psap. Analysis of the levels of c-Myc and Tsp-i are also contemplated. The levels of a
variety of angiogenic growth factors and angiogenesis inhibitors are also contemplated as being relevant
to prognosis, and methods for evaluating them are known to one skilled in the art.
[0329]             In one embodiment, the angiogenesis-dependent disease or disorder is selected from a
group consisting of cancer, psoriasis, age-related macular degeneration, thyroid hyperplasia,
preeclampsia, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, Alzheimer's disease, obesity, pleural effusion,
atherosclerosis, endometriosis, diabetic/other retinopathies, neovascular glaucoma, age-related macular
degeneration, hemangiomas, and corneal neovascularization.
[0330]             In another embodiment, the treatment is administered in conjunction with chemotherapy,
radiation therapy, a cytostatic agent, an anti-VEGF agent, an anti-angiogenesis factor, and/or a p53
reactivation agent.
[0331]             In one embodiment, the method for diagnosing metastasis an individual diagnosed with
cancer comprises determining the level of Psap expression in a sample from an individual diagnosed with
cancer, wherein when the level of Psap in the sample is the same or lower than a reference Psap level,
there is an increased likelihood of cancer metastasis and/or recurrence of neoplastic disease, and thus a
poor prognosis. The sample can be blood, preferably platelet, serum or plasma. Methods of collecting and
isolating platelets, serum or plasma are well known in the art. The reference Psap level is the average
Psap level in the corresponding platelets, serum or plasma of normal healthy individuals not diagnosed
with any cancer. The reference Psap levels are normalized to 100%. The Psap levels in the platelets,
serum or plasma of patients having non-metastatic cancer are higher than the reference Psap levels, e.g.,
at least 5% higher. On the other hand, the Psap levels in platelets, serum or plasma of patients having
metastatic cancer tend to be comparable, and can even be lower than the reference Psap levels. Hence,
when a sample from an individual recently diagnosed with cancer has a slightly lower Psap level in the
plasma compared to the reference Psap level, there is an increased likelihood that individual's cancer has
already metastasized.
[0332]             In one embodiment, the method for prognostic evaluation of an individual diagnosed
with cancer comprises determining the level of Psap expression in a tumor sample from an individual
diagnosed with cancer, wherein when the level of Psap in the tumor sample is lower than a reference

and thus a poor prognosis.
[0333]           In one embodiment, the method for prognostic evaluation in an individual diagnosed
with cancer comprises: (a) determining the level of Psap expression in a sample from an individual
diagnosed with cancer at a first time point; (b) determining the level of Psap expression in a sample from
an individual diagnosed with cancer at a second time point, the first time point being before the second
time point; and (c) comparing the levels of Psap from the time points with a reference Psap level;
wherein when the level of Psap at the second time point becomes lower than the reference Psap level, the
cancer has likely metastased.
[0334]           In one embodiment, the sample is blood, platelets, serum or plasma.
[0335]           The method described herein makes a prediction on the likelihood of cancer metastasis,
recurrence, and relapse of neoplastic disease in a subject diagnosed with cancer by comparing the level of
Psap in the tumor to a reference level of Psap. A reference level of Psap can be that obtained from a
control sample of non-tumor, healthy cells in the same tissue type or organ type from which a tumor
sample was excised. The reference Psap level is normalized to 100%. A lower level of Psap determined
in a tumor sample compared to a reference Psap level is about 95% to 0% of the reference Psap level,
including all percentages between 95% and 0%, i.e., about 95%, 80%, 70% ......      , 20%,.....,10 %
      5%,.2%....0% of the reference Psap level. For example, if the prognosis is for breast cancer in a
female subject, the reference Psap level is determined using healthy breast tissue from a female subject.
This reference breast Psap level is compared with a level of Psap determined in a breast cancer tissue
sample. If the breast cancer tissue sample has a Psap level of 65% of a reference Psap level found in a
healthy breast tissue sample, the prognosis is an increased likelihood of cancer metastasis and/or
recurrence of neoplastic disease, and thus a poor prognosis.
[0336]           In one embodiment, the method for prognostic evaluation of an individual diagnosed
with cancer further comprises: (a) determining the level of Psap expression in the tumor stroma; and (b)
determining the level of Tsp-i expression in the tumor stroma, wherein when the levels of Psap and Tsp
1 in the tumor stroma are lower than a reference Psap level and a reference Tsp-i level respectively, there
is an increased likelihood of cancer metastasis and/or recurrence of neoplastic disease, and thus a poor
prognosis. The method described herein makes a prediction on the likelihood of cancer metastasis,
recurrence, and relapse of neoplastic disease in a subject diagnosed with cancer by comparing the levels
of Psap and Tsp-I in the tumor stroma with reference levels of Psap and Tsp-1. Reference levels of Psap
and Tsp-I are those obtained from a control sample of non-tumor, healthy cells in the same tissue type or
organ type from which a tumor sample was excised. The reference Psap andTsp- I levels are normalized
to 100%. Lower levels of Psap and Tsp-I in a tumor sample compared to the reference Psap and Tsp-I
levels are about 95% to 0% of the reference Psap level, including all percentages between 95% and 0%,
i.e., about 95%, 80%, 70% ......  , 20%.,0       %.    5%,.2%....0% of the reference Psap or Tsp-I
levels. For example, if the prognosis is for lung cancer in a male subject, the reference Psap and Tsp-i
                                                  60

    WO 2011/084685                                                                PCT/US2010/061007
levels are determined using healthy lung tissue from a male subject. These reference lung Psap and Tsp-I
levels are then compared with levels of Psap and Tsp-i determined in a lung cancer tissue sample. If the
lung cancer tissue sample has a Psap level of 25% and a Tsp-I level of 5% compared to the respective
reference Psap and Tsp-I levels found in healthy lung tissue, the prognosis is an increased likelihood of
cancer metastasis and/or recurrence of neoplastic disease, and thus a poor prognosis. Since highly
metastatic tumors have virtually no detectable Tsp-i and Psap, extremely low levels (i.e., about 30%
0% of the reference levels) or undetectable amounts of Psap and Tsp-I in the cancer tissue sample
strongly indicate definite cancer metastasis and/or recurrence of neoplastic disease, and thus a poor
prognosis, and would require an aggressive treatment plan. On the basis of the prognosis and the levels
of Tsp-I and Psap in a cancer tissue sample, a clinician skilled in the art can design a customized
treatment plan for an afflicted individual. The treatment plan can include administering isolated peptide
consisting essentially of the sequence CDWLPKPNMSASC (SEQ. ID. No. 37),
LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI (SEQ. ID. No. 29) or a conservative substitution variant thereof,
wherein the peptide is flanked by 0-4 amino acid residues on either terminus or both termini and/or
chimeric polypeptides described herein, in conjunction with surgical removal of tumors or tissue with
cancerous lesions, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, a cytostatic agent, an anti-VEGF agent, an anti
angiogenesis factor and/or a p53 reactivation agent. Administering a composition comprising isolated
peptide consistisg essentially of the sequence CDWLPKPNMSASC (SEQ. ID. No. 37),
LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI (SEQ. ID. No. 29) or conservative substitution variant thereof, wherein
the peptide is flanked by 0-4 amino acid residues on either terminus or both termini systemically raises
the level of Psap and consequently the Tsp-I and p53 in the cancer cells, surrounding tissue, and
potential metastatic sites to which a metastatic cancer cell can target. This can prevent future metastasis
and also establishment of secondary tumors. Compositions comprising of isolated peptide consisting
essentially of the sequence CDWLPKPNMSASC (SEQ. ID. No. 37) or LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI
(SEQ. ID. No. 29), wherein the peptide is flanked by 0-4 amino acid residues on either terminus or both
termini and/or chimeric polypeptides described herein can also be injected intratumorly.
[0337]            In another embodiment, the method for monitoring or surveillance for the development
of metastasis in an individual diagnosed with cancer comprises determining the level of Psap expression
in a sample from an individual at a first time point, determining the level of Psap expression in a sample
from the individual at a second time point, the first time point being before the second time point;
comparing the levels of Psap from the time points with a reference Psap level, wherein when the levels of
Psap at the second time point are lower than the reference Psap level, e.g., 95% or less, the cancer is
deemed likely to have developed into a metastasic cancer and thus evidences a poor prognosis. The
sample can be blood, preferably platelets, serum or plasma. The reference Psap level is the average Psap
level in the corresponding platelets, serum or plasma of normal healthy individuals not diagnosed with
any cancer. The reference Psap levels are normalized to 100%. The Psap levels in the platelets, serum or
plasma of patients diagnosed having non-metastatic cancer is higher than the reference Psap levels, at
                                                  61

    WO 2011/084685                                                                  PCT/US2010/061007
least 5% higher. On the other hand, the Psap levels in platelet, serum or plasma of patients having
metastatic cancer can be the same, and/or lower than the reference Psap levels. The Psap level in the
sample can be used as a biomarker for the progression of the disease into the metastatic form. For
example, in a patient who has been newly diagnosed with breast cancer. A single tumor mass was found
and excised. There was no indication that the tumor had metastasized. A sample of her plasma is
collected at this initial diagnosis and the Psap level in her plasma is determined and compared to the
reference Psap level. Over the next few years, periodic sampling of her plasma Psap level can be
performed, e.g., every three months initially for the first two years, then every six months for the next
five years thereafter if she remains cancer free in the first two years. These samplings of plasma Psap
level can be compared to the reference Psap level and charted over time. When there is a drop in her
plasma Psap level compared to the reference Psap level, at least 5%, this is an indication that possibly the
cancer has recurred and is of the metastatic form. Her physician can then perform a thorough screening
for the cancer recurrence. The method described herein provides a method of prognosis evaluation in an
individual diagnosed with cancer.
Plasma, serum, and platelet sampling
[0338]            The patient's blood can be drawn directly into anti-coagulants containing citrate, EDTA,
PGE, and theophylline. The whole blood should be separated into the plasma portion, the cells, and
platelets portion by refrigerated centrifugation at 3500 g, 2 minutes. Since platelets have a tendency to
adhere to glass, it is preferred that the collection tube be siliconized. After centrifugation, the supernatant
is the plasma. The plasma is filtered though a 0.2 pm filter to remove residual platelets and is kept at
20'C before measurements are performed.
[0339]            Alternately, the serum can be collected from the whole blood. Collect the blood in a hard
plastic or glass tube; blood will not clot in soft plastic. Draw 15 mL of whole blood for 6 mL of serum.
The whole blood is allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to 2 hours until a clot has
formed. Carefully separate clot from the sides of the container using a glass rod or wooden applicator
stick and leave overnight at 40 C. After which, decant serum, centrifuge, and/or using a Pasteur pipette,
remove serum into a clean tube. Clarify the serum by centrifugation at 2000-3000 rpm for 10 minutes.
The serum is stored at -20' or -80'C measurement is performed. Detailed described of obtaining serum
using collection tubes can be found in U. S. Patent No. 3,837,376 and is incorporated by reference. Blood
collection tubes can also be purchased from BD Diagnostic Systems, Greiner Bio-One, and Kendall
Company.
[0340]            Platelets can be separated from whole blood. When whole blood is centrifuged as
described herein to separate the blood cells from the plasma, a pellet is formed at the end of the
centrifugation, with the plasma above it. Centrifugation separates out the blood components (red blood
cells, white blood cells, and platelets) by their various densities. The red blood cells (RBCs) are denser
and will be the first to move to the bottom of the collection/centrifugation tube, followed by the smaller
white blood cells, and finally the platelets. The plasma fraction is the least dense and is found on top of
                                                    62

    WO 2011/084685                                                                 PCT/US2010/061007
the pellet. The "buffy coat" which contains the majority of platelets will be sandwiched between the
plasma and above the RBCs. Centrifugation of whole blood (with anti-coagulant, PGE and theophylline)
can produce an isolated a platelet rich "buffy coat" that lies just above the buoy. The "buffy" coat
contains the concentrated platelets and white blood cells.
[0341]            Platelets can be separated from blood according to methods described in United States
Patent No. 4,656,035 using lectin to agglutinate the platelets in whole blood. Alternatively, the methods
and apparatus described in United States Patent No. 7,223,346 can be used involving a platelet collection
device comprising a centrifugal spin-separator container with a cavity having a longitudinal inner surface
in order to collect the "buffy coat" enriched with platelets after centrifugation. As another alternative, the
methods and apparatus as described in WO/2001/066172 can be used. Each of these are incorporated by
reference herein in their entirety.
[0342]            Platelets can be isolated by the two methods described in A. L. Copley and R. B.
Houlihan, Blood, 1947, 2:170-181, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Both
methods are based on the principle that the platelet layer can be obtained by repeated fractional
centrifugation.
[0343]            The whole blood can be first separated into platelet-rich plasma and cells (white and red
blood cells). Platelet rich plasma (PRP) can be isolated from the blood centrifugation of citrated whole
blood at 200xG for 20 minutes. The platelet rich plasma is then transferred to a fresh polyethylene tube.
This PRP is then centrifuged at 800 X G to pellet the platelets and the supernatant (platelet poor plasma
[PPP]) can be saved for analysis by ELIZA at a later stage. Platelets can be then gently re-suspended in a
buffer such as Tyrodes buffer containing 1U/ml PGE2 and pelleted by centrifugation again. The wash
can be repeated twice in this manner before removing the membrane fraction of platelets by
centrifugation with Triton X, and lysing the pellet of platelet for Psap analyses. Platelets can be lysed
using 50 mM Tris HCL, 100-120 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Igepal and Protease Inhibitor Tablet
(complete TM mixture, Boehringer Manheim, Indianopolis, IN). For the analysis of Psap mRNA, the
pellet of platelets can be dissolved in TRIZOL@ immediately after separation from the plasma.
Determining expression level by measuring mRNA
[0344]            Real time PCR is an amplification technique that can be used to determine levels of
mRNA expression. (See, e.g., Gibson et al., Genome Research 6:995-1001, 1996; Heid et al., Genome
Research 6:986-994, 1996). Real-time PCR evaluates the level of PCR product accumulation during
amplification. This technique permits quantitative evaluation of mRNA levels in multiple samples. For
mRNA levels, mRNA is extracted from a biological sample, e.g., a tumor and normal tissue, and cDNA
is prepared using standard techniques. Real-time PCR can be performed, for example, using a Perkin
Elmer/Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) 7700 Prism instrument. Matching primers and fluorescent
probes can be designed for genes of interest using, for example, the primer express program provided by
Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.). Optimal concentrations of primers and probes can
be initially determined by those of ordinary skill in the art, and control (for example, beta-actin) primers
                                                   63

    WO 2011/084685                                                                  PCT/US2010/061007
and probes can be obtained commercially from, for example, Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems (Foster
City, Calif.). To quantitate the amount of the specific nucleic acid of interest in a sample, a standard
curve is generated using a control. Standard curves can be generated using the Ct values determined in
the real-time PCR, which are related to the initial concentration of the nucleic acid of interest used in the
assay. Standard dilutions ranging from 10'-106 copies of the gene of interest are generally sufficient. In
addition, a standard curve is generated for the control sequence. This permits standardization of initial
content of the nucleic acid of interest in a tissue sample to the amount of control for comparison
purposes.
[0345]           Methods of real-time quantitative PCR using TaqMan probes are well known in the art.
Detailed protocols for real-time quantitative PCR can be found in, e.g., for RNA in Gibson et al., 1996,
Genome Res., 10:995-1001 and for DNA in Heid et al., 1996, Genome Res., 10:986-994.
[0346]           The TaqMan based assays use a fluorogenic oligonucleotide probe that contains a 5'
fluorescent dye and a 3' quenching agent. The probe hybridizes to a PCR product, but cannot itself be
extended due to a blocking agent at the 3' end. When the PCR product is amplified in subsequent cycles,
the 5' nuclease activity of the polymerase, for example, AmpliTaq, results in the cleavage of the TaqMan
probe. This cleavage separates the 5' fluorescent dye and the 3' quenching agent, thereby resulting in an
increase in fluorescence as a function of amplification (see, for example, www2.perkin-elmer.com).
[0347]           In another embodiment, detection of RNA transcripts can be achieved by Northern
blotting, wherein a preparation of RNA is run on a denaturing agarose gel, and transferred to a suitable
support, such as activated cellulose, nitrocellulose or glass or nylon membranes. Labeled (e.g.,
radiolabeled) cDNA or RNA is then hybridized to the preparation, washed and analyzed by methods such
as autoradiography.
[0348]           Detection of RNA transcripts can further be accomplished using known amplification
methods. For example, it is within the scope of the present invention to reverse transcribe mRNA into
cDNA followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); or, to use a single enzyme for both steps as
described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,322,770, or reverse transcribe mRNA into cDNA followed by symmetric gap
lipase chain reaction (RT-AGLCR) as described by R. L. Marshall, et al., PCR Methods and Applications
4: 80-84 (1994). One suitable method for detecting enzyme mRNA transcripts is described in reference
Pabic et al., Hepatology, 37(5): 1056-1066, 2003, which is herein incorporated by reference in its
entirety.
[0349]           Other known amplification methods which can be utilized herein include but are not
limited to the so-called "NASBA" or "3SR" technique described in PNAS USA 87: 1874-1878 (1990)
and also described in Nature 350 (No. 6313): 91-92 (1991); Q-beta amplification as described in
published European Patent Application (EPA) No. 4544610; strand displacement amplification (as
described in G. T. Walker et al., Clin. Chem. 42: 9-13 (1996) and European Patent Application No.

to demonstrate the histological composition of the sample, and dark field imaging with a suitable light
filter shows the developed emulsion. Non-radioactive labels such as digoxigenin can also be used.
[0351]            Alternatively, mRNA expression can be detected on a DNA array, chip or a microarray.
Oligonucleotides corresponding to enzyme are immobilized on a chip which is then hybridized with
labeled nucleic acids of a test sample obtained from a patient. Positive hybridization signal is obtained
with the sample containing enzyme transcripts. Methods of preparing DNA arrays and their use are well
known in the art. (See, for example U.S. Patent Nos: 6,618,6796; 6,379,897; 6,664,377; 6,451,536;
548,257; U.S. Patent Application No. 20030157485 and Schena et al., 1995 Science 20:467-470; Gerhold
et al., 1999 Trends in Biochem. Sci. 24, 168-173; and Lennon et al. 2000 Drug discovery Today 5: 59-65,
which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). Serial Analysis of Gene Expression
(SAGE) can also be performed (See for example U.S. Patent Application 20030215858).
[0352]            To monitor mRNA levels, for example, mRNA is extracted from the tissue sample to be
tested, reverse transcribed, and fluorescent-labeled cDNA probes are generated. The microarrays capable
of hybridizing to enzyme cDNA are then probed with the labeled cDNA probes, the slides scanned and
fluorescence intensity measured. This intensity correlates with the hybridization intensity and expression
levels.
[0353]            Methods of "quantitative" amplification are well known to those of skill in the art. For
example, quantitative PCR involves simultaneously co-amplifying a known quantity of a control
sequence using the same primers. This provides an internal standard that can be used to calibrate the PCR
reaction. Detailed protocols for quantitative PCR are provided, for example, in Innis et al., (1990) PCR
Protocols, A Guide to Methods and Applications, Academic Press, Inc. N.Y.
[0354]            Determining expression level by measuring protein
[0355]            In one embodiment, the levels of Psap and Tsp-i proteins are measured by contacting the
tissue sample with an antibody-based binding moiety that specifically binds to Psap or Tsp-i, or to a
fragment of Psap or Tsp-i. Formation of the antibody- protein complex is then detected by a variety of
methods known in the art.
[0356]            The term "antibody-based binding moiety" or "antibody" includes immunoglobulin
molecules and immunologically active determinants of immunoglobulin molecules, e.g., molecules that
contain an antigen binding site which specifically binds (immunoreacts with) to the Psap proteins. The
term "antibody-based binding moiety" is intended to include whole antibodies, e.g., of any isotype (IgG,
IgA, IgM, IgE, etc), and includes fragments thereof which are also specifically reactive with the Psap
proteins. Antibodies can be fragmented using conventional techniques. Thus, the term includes
segments of proteolytically-cleaved or recombinantly-prepared portions of an antibody molecule that are
capable of selectively reacting with a certain protein. Non limiting examples of such proteolytic and/or
                                                    65

    WO 2011/084685                                                                 PCT/US2010/061007
recombinant fragments include Fab, F(ab')2, Fab' , Fv, dAbs and single chain antibodies (scFv)
containing a VL and VH domain joined by a peptide linker. The scFv's can be covalently or non
covalently linked to form antibodies having two or more binding sites. Thus, "antibody-base binding
moiety" includes polyclonal, monoclonal, or other purified preparations of antibodies and recombinant
antibodies. The term "antibody-base binding moiety" is further intended to include humanized antibodies,
bispecific antibodies, and chimeric molecules having at least one antigen binding determinant derived
from an antibody molecule. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody-based binding moiety detectably
labeled.
[0357]           "Labeled antibody", as used herein, includes antibodies that are labeled by a detectable
means and include, but are not limited to, antibodies that are enzymatically, radioactively, fluorescently,
and chemiluminescently labeled. Antibodies can also be labeled with a detectable tag, such as c-Myc,
HA, VSV-G, HSV, FLAG, V5, or HIS. The detection and quantification of Psap or Tsp-i present in the
tissuel samples correlate to the intensity of the signal emitted from the detectably labeled antibody.
[0358]           In one preferred embodiment, the antibody-based binding moiety is detectably labeled by
linking the antibody to an enzyme. The enzyme, in turn, when exposed to its substrate, will react with the
substrate in such a manner as to produce a chemical moiety which can be detected, for example, by
spectrophotometric, fluorometric or by visual means. Enzymes which can be used to detectably label the
antibodies of the present invention include, but are not limited to, malate dehydrogenase, staphylococcal
nuclease, delta-V-steroid isomerase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, alpha-glycerophosphate
dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, asparaginase,
glucose oxidase, beta-galactosidase, ribonuclease, urease, catalase, glucose-VI-phosphate dehydrogenase,
glucoamylase and acetylcholinesterase.
[0359]           Detection can also be accomplished using any of a variety of other immunoassays. For
example, by radioactively labeling an antibody, it is possible to detect the antibody through the use of
radioimmune assays. The radioactive isotope can be detected by such means as the use of a gamma
counter or a scintillation counter or by audioradiography. Isotopes which are particularly useful for the
purpose of the present invention are 3H,    1311
                                                     14
                                                        C, and preferably 1251.
[0360]           It is also possible to label an antibody with a fluorescent compound. When the
fluorescently labeled antibody is exposed to light of the proper wavelength, its presence can then be
detected due to fluorescence. Among the most commonly used fluorescent labeling compounds are CYE
dyes, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, phycoerytherin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o
phthaldehyde and fluorescamine.
[0361]           An antibody can also be detectably labeled using fluorescence emitting metals such as
152Eu, or others of the lanthanide series. These metals can be attached to the antibody using such metal
chelating groups as diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA).

[0362]           An antibody also can be detectably labeled by coupling it to a chemiluminescent
compound. The presence of the chemiluminescent-antibody is then determined by detecting the presence
of luminescence that arises during the course of a chemical reaction. Examples of particularly useful
chemiluminescent labeling compounds are luminol, luciferin, isoluminol, theromatic acridinium ester,
imidazole, acridinium salt and oxalate ester.
[0363]           As mentioned above, levels of enzyme protein can be detected by immunoassays, such as
enzyme linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), Immunoradiometric assay
(IRMA), Western blotting, immunocytochemistry or immunohistochemistry, each of which are described
in more detail below. Immunoassays such as ELISA or RIA, which can be extremely rapid, are more
generally preferred. Antibody arrays or protein chips can also be employed, see for example U.S. Patent
Application Nos: 20030013208A1; 20020155493A1; 20030017515 and U.S. Patent Nos: 6,329,209;
6,365,418, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.
[0364]           Immunoassays
[0365]           The most common enzyme immunoassay is the "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
(ELISA). " ELISA is a technique for detecting and measuring the concentration of an antigen using a
labeled (e.g., enzyme linked) form of the antibody. There are different forms of ELISA, which are well
known to those skilled in the art. The standard techniques known in the art for ELISA are described in
"Methods in Immunodiagnosis", 2nd Edition, Rose and Bigazzi, eds. John Wiley & Sons, 1980;
Campbell et al., "Methods and Immunology", W. A. Benjamin, Inc., 1964; and Oellerich, M. 1984, J.
Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem., 22:895-904.
[0366]           In a "sandwich ELISA", an antibody (e.g., anti-enzyme) is linked to a solid phase (i.e., a
microtiter plate) and exposed to a biological sample containing antigen (e.g., enzyme). The solid phase is
then washed to remove unbound antigen. A labeled antibody (e.g., enzyme linked) is then bound to the
bound-antigen (if present) forming an antibody-antigen-antibody sandwich. Examples of enzymes that
can be linked to the antibody are alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, luciferase, urease, and B
galactosidase. The enzyme linked antibody reacts with a substrate to generate a colored reaction product
that can be measured.
[0367]           In a "competitive ELISA", antibody is incubated with a sample containing antigen (i.e.,
enzyme). The antigen-antibody mixture is then contacted with a solid phase (e.g., a microtiter plate) that
is coated with antigen (i.e., enzyme). The more antigen present in the sample, the less free antibody that
will be available to bind to the solid phase. A labeled (e.g., enzyme linked) secondary antibody is then
added to the solid phase to determine the amount of primary antibody bound to the solid phase.
[0368]           In an "immunohistochemistry assay" a section of tissue is tested for specific proteins by
exposing the tissue to antibodies that are specific for the protein that is being assayed. The antibodies are
then visualized by any of a number of methods to determine the presence and amount of the protein
present. Examples of methods used to visualize antibodies are, for example, through enzymes linked to
the antibodies (e.g., luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, or beta-galactosidase), or
                                                  67

    WO 2011/084685                                                                  PCT/US2010/061007
chemical methods (e.g., DAB/Substrate chromagen). The sample is then analysed microscopically, most
preferably by light microscopy of a sample stained with a stain that is detected in the visible spectrum,
using any of a variety of such staining methods and reagents known to those skilled in the art.
[0369]           Alternatively, "Radioimmunoassays" can be employed. A radioimmunoassay is a
technique for detecting and measuring the concentration of an antigen using a labeled (e.g., radioactively
or fluorescently labeled) form of the antigen. Examples of radioactive labels for antigens include 3H,
14C, and 1251. The concentration of antigen enzyme in a biological sample is measured by having the
antigen in the biological sample compete with the labeled (e.g., radioactively) antigen for binding to an
antibody to the antigen. To ensure competitive binding between the labeled antigen and the unlabeled
antigen, the labeled antigen is present in a concentration sufficient to saturate the binding sites of the
antibody. The higher the concentration of antigen in the sample, the lower the concentration of labeled
antigen that will bind to the antibody.
[0370]           In a radioimmunoassay, to determine the concentration of labeled antigen bound to
antibody, the antigen-antibody complex must be separated from the free antigen. One method for
separating the antigen-antibody complex from the free antigen is by precipitating the antigen-antibody
complex with an anti-isotype antiserum. Another method for separating the antigen-antibody complex
from the free antigen is by precipitating the antigen-antibody complex with formalin-killed S. aureus. Yet
another method for separating the antigen-antibody complex from the free antigen is by performing a
"solid-phase radioimmunoassay" where the antibody is linked (e.g., covalently) to Sepharose beads,
polystyrene wells, polyvinylchloride wells, or microtiter wells. By comparing the concentration of
labeled antigen bound to antibody to a standard curve based on samples having a known concentration of
antigen, the concentration of antigen in the biological sample can be determined.
[0371]           An "Immunoradiometric assay" (IRMA) is an immunoassay in which the antibody
reagent is radioactively labeled. An IRMA requires the production of a multivalent antigen conjugate; by
techniques such as conjugation to a protein e.g., rabbit serum albumin (RSA). The multivalent antigen
conjugate must have at least 2 antigen residues per molecule and the antigen residues must be of
sufficient distance apart to allow binding by at least two antibodies to the antigen. For example, in an
IRMA the multivalent antigen conjugate can be attached to a solid surface such as a plastic sphere.
Unlabeled "sample" antigen and antibody to antigen which is radioactively labeled are added to a test
tube containing the multivalent antigen conjugate coated sphere. The antigen in the sample competes
with the multivalent antigen conjugate for antigen antibody binding sites. After an appropriate incubation
period, the unbound reactants are removed by washing and the amount of radioactivity on the solid phase
is determined. The amount of bound radioactive antibody is inversely proportional to the concentration of
antigen in the sample.
[0372]           Other techniques can be used to detect Psap and Tsp-I in the tissue samples obtained in a
biopsy, according to a practitioner's preference, and based upon the present disclosure. One such
technique is Western blotting (Towbin et at., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 76:4350 (1979)), wherein a suitably
                                                  68

     WO 2011/084685                                                                 PCT/US2010/061007
treated sample is run on an SDS-PAGE gel before being transferred to a solid support, such as a
nitrocellulose filter. Detectably labeled anti- enzyme antibodies can then be used to assess enzyme
levels, where the intensity of the signal from the detectable label corresponds to the amount of enzyme
present. Levels can be quantified, for example by densitometry.
[0373]            In one embodiment, Psap and Tsp-i, and /or their mRNA levels in the tissue sample can
be determined by mass spectrometry such as MALDI/TOF (time-of-flight), SELDI/TOF, liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high
performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), capillary electrophoresis-mass
spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, or tandem mass spectrometry (e.g., MS/MS,
MS/MS/MS, ESI-MS/MS, etc.). See for example, U.S. Patent Application Nos: 20030199001,
20030134304, and 20030077616, which are herein incorporated by reference.
[0374]            Mass spectrometry methods are well known in the art and have been used to quantify
and/or identify biomolecules, such as proteins (see, e.g., Li et al., (2000) Tibtech 18:151-160; Rowley et
al., (2000) Methods 20: 383-397; and Kuster and Mann (1998) Curr. Opin. Structural Biol. 8: 393-400).
Further, mass spectrometric techniques have been developed that permit at least partial de novo
sequencing of isolated proteins. Chait et al., Science 262:89-92 (1993); Keough et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci. USA. 96:7131-6 (1999); reviewed in Bergman, EXS 88:133-44 (2000).
[0375]            In certain embodiments, a gas phase ion spectrophotometer is used. In other
embodiments, laser-desorption/ionization mass spectrometry is used to analyze the sample. Modern laser
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry ("LDI-MS") can be practiced in two main variations: matrix
assisted laser desorption/ionization ("MALDI") mass spectrometry and surface-enhanced laser
desorption/ionization ("SELDI"). In MALDI, the analyte is mixed with a solution containing a matrix,
and a drop of the liquid is placed on the surface of a substrate. The matrix solution then co-crystallizes
with the biological molecules. The substrate is inserted into the mass spectrometer. Laser energy is
directed to the substrate surface where it desorbs and ionizes the biological molecules without
significantly fragmenting them. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,118,937 and 5,045,694.
[0376]            In SELDI, the substrate surface is modified so that it is an active participant in the
desorption process. In one variant, the surface is derivatized with adsorbent and/or capture reagents that
selectively bind the protein of interest. In another variant, the surface is derivatized with energy
absorbing molecules that are not desorbed when struck with the laser. In another variant, the surface is
derivatized with molecules that bind the protein of interest and that contain a photolytic bond that is
broken upon application of the laser. In each of these methods, the derivatizing agent generally is
localized to a specific location on the substrate surface where the sample is applied. See, e.g., U.S. Pat.
No. 5,719,060 and WO 98/59361. The two methods can be combined by, for example, using a SELDI
affinity surface to capture an analyte and adding matrix-containing liquid to the captured analyte to
provide the energy absorbing material.

Instrumental Analysis, 3rd edition., Skoog, Saunders College Publishing, Philadelphia, 1985; and Kirk
Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4.sup.th ed. Vol. 15 (John Wiley & Sons, New York
1995), pp. 1071-1094.
[0378]            Detection of the presence of Psap or Tsp-I mRNA or protein will typically depend on the
detection of signal intensity. This, in turn, can reflect the quantity and character of a polypeptide bound
to the substrate. For example, in certain embodiments, the signal strength of peak values from spectra of
a first sample and a second sample can be compared (e.g., visually, by computer analysis etc.), to
determine the relative amounts of particular biomolecules. Software programs such as the Biomarker
Wizard program (Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc., Fremont, Calif.) can be used to aid in analyzing mass
spectra. The mass spectrometers and their techniques are well known to those of skill in the art.
Antibodies or antisera against Psap and Tsp-1 proteins
[0379]            In one embodiment, the diagnostic method of the invention uses antibodies or anti-sera
for determining the expression levels of Psap and Tsp-i. The antibodies for use in the present invention
can be obtained from a commercial source such as Novus Biologicals (anti-prosaposin, Clone IDI-C12,
catalog #H00005660-M01), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Anti-saposin B (E-15), catalog #sc-27014; anti
Tsp-i, Clone CSI 002-65, catalog # sc-59888), and Labvision (anti-Tsp-1, clone Ab-2, catalog #MS-419
B) .The antibodies can be polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies. Alternatively, antibodies can be raised
against Psap protein (Genbank Accession No. NM002778) or Tsp-i (Genbank Accession No.
NM_003246). Methods for the production of enzyme antibodies are disclosed in PCT publication WO
97/40072 or U.S. Application. No. 2002/0182702, which are herein incorporated by reference.
[0380]            Antibodies for use in the present invention can be produced using standard methods to
produce antibodies, for example, by monoclonal antibody production (Campbell, A.M., Monoclonal
Antibodies Technology: Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Elsevier
Science Publishers, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (1984); St. Groth et al., J. Immunology, (1990) 35: 1
21; and Kozbor et al., Immunology Today (1983) 4:72). Antibodies can also be readily obtained by
using antigenic portions of the protein to screen an antibody library, such as a phage display library by
methods well known in the art. For example, U.S. patent 5,702,892 and WO 01/18058 disclose
bacteriophage display libraries and selection methods for producing antibody binding domain fragments.
[0381]            Detection of Psap and Tsp-I antibodies can be achieved by direct labeling of the
antibodies themselves, with labels including a radioactive label such as 3H,   14
                                                                                  C, 35

fluorescent label, a hapten label such as biotin, or an enzyme such as horse radish peroxidase or alkaline
phosphatase. Alternatively, unlabeled primary antibody is used in conjunction with labeled secondary
antibody, comprising antisera, polyclonal antisera or a monoclonal antibody specific for the primary
antibody. In one embodiment, the primary antibody or antisera is unlabeled, the secondary antisera or
antibody is conjugated with biotin and enzyme-linked strepavidin is used to produce visible staining for
histochemical analysis.

                                                  EXAMPLES
Experimental Procedures
Cell lines
[0391]            The cell lines PC3 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA). PC3M-LN4 was the generous gift of Dr. Isaiah Fidler (MD Anderson Cancer Center,
Houston, TX). The prostate cancer cell lines were grown in RPMI medium containing 10 %fetal bovine
serum (FBS). The prostate fibroblasts were grown in DMEM medium with 10% FBS. The WI 38 and
MRC 5 lung fibroblasts were also obtained from the ATCC and were grown in MEM medium with 10 %
FBS.
Animal studies
[0392]            All animal work was done in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Male SCID mice 6-8 weeks old were injected with 2 x 106 viable cells
in the prostate gland. The cells were washed and harvested in PBS prior to injection into the prostate
glands of anaesthetized mice (2% avertin, 0.5 ml per mouse) in a volume of 0.8 ml. Endpoint assays
were conducted at 5 weeks after injection unless significant morbidity required that the mouse be
euthanized earlier.
In vitro conditioned media assays and co-culture assays
                                                    74

    WO 2011/084685                                                               PCT/US2010/061007
[0393]           For the conditioned media assay, 1.5x106 tumor cells and fibroblasts cells were grown in
the tumor cell media containing 0.1% FBS for 12 hours at which point the conditioned media from the
tumor cells was centrifuged to remove any cells or cell debris and transferred to the fibroblasts
subsequent to removal of the low serum fibroblast growth media. All assays were performed a minimum
of five times and representative samples depicted. The fibroblasts and media were harvested after 12 to
16 hours after addition of the tumor cell conditioned media and lysed for the western blot analysis while
the conditioned media was collected for ELISA analysis. For the co-culture assays, 1x106 fibroblasts
were seeded in the bottom chamber of transwell tissue culture plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) and
1x106 tumor cells were seeded on the membrane in the top chamber of the plates. The two cell types
were co-cultured for 40 to 44 hours in tumor cell media containing 0.1% FBS before harvesting and
lysing the fibroblasts for western blot analysis and collecting the media for ELISA analysis.
Western Blot analyses and ELISA analysis
[0394]           For Western blotting, cells were harvested by mechanical scraping into 40C PBS, cell
pellets were obtained by removing PBS after centrifugation at 13,000rpm in a Heraeus Biofuge Fresco
(Thermo Electron, Asheville, NC) for 2 min. Cells were then lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150
mM NaCl, 1 %NP40, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 5 mM NaF, 20 mM P-glycerophosphate, and
complete protease inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and protein concentrations were determined by the
BioRad protein assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Fifty micrograms of protein were loaded per well onto a
4-12 %pre-cast Bis-Tris gel (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The protein extracts were electrophoresed and
transferred to an immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked in 5
%nonfat milk and incubated in primary antibody to Tsp-I (Ab- 11, LabVision, Fremont, CA), c-Myc and
phospho-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), Prosaposin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA), P-actin (AbCam, Cambridge, UK). The membranes were then washed in PBS + 0.1 %
Tween-20 and incubated with either HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) followed by another wash. The membrane was
then developed with ECL reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and exposed on film. Protein volume intensity
was determined using a Bio-Rad Chemi-Doc XRS system (Bio-Rad, CA).
[0395]           For ELISA analysis, the conditioned media were centrifuged to remove cell debris and
the supernatant retained to measure VEGF levels using an ELISA kit that was specific for human VEGF
(R & D, Minneapolis, MN). VEGF levels were normalized against total protein from the cells used in the
assay. Xenograft tumors and tissue samples were homogenized and suspended in PBS and murine VEGF
levels were determined using an ELISA kit that was specific for murine VEGF (R & D, Minneapolis,
MN) results were normalized against the mass of the tumors. All error bars included in the graphical
depiction of ELISA data represent SEM (Standard Error of Mean).
Immunohistochemistry
[0396]           Thin paraffin sections (5 ptm) from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded prostate
tumors and lung tissue were dewaxed with xylene/ethanol before heat induced microwave epitope
                                                  75

    WO 2011/084685                                                                PCT/US2010/061007
retrieval in Tris-HCL (pH 1.0) for 15 minutes. Immunostaining of tissue sections was performed on the
DAKO Autostainer with the DAKO ARK (animal research kit) peroxidase (Dako Cytomation,
Copenhagen, Denmark) as detection system. The slides were incubated with a mouse monoclonal
thrombospondin antibody (TSP-Ab-4, clone A6. 1) (Neomarkers, CA), diluted 1:50 for 60 minutes at
room temperature. Antigen localization was achieved using the DAB diaminobenzidine peroxidase
reaction, counterstained with hematoxylin. Sections incubated with isotypic mouse IgGI (Dako
Cytomation, Denmark) served as negative controls. Thrombospondin expression was evaluated
subjectively by estimating the staining intensity and percentage positivity. A staining index (values 0-9),
obtained as a product of staining intensity (0-3) and proportion of immunopositive tumor cells ( 10%=1,
10-50%=2, >50%=3), was calculated. Cases with a TSP staining index < 2 were defined as
weak/negative.
[0397]            Regarding p53, sections were stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody (p53
PAB 1802; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), incubated overnight (40C), dilution 1:10, after heat
induced microwave epitope retrieval in TRS (pH 6.0) for 15 minutes. For p53, only nuclear staining was
considered, and staining intensity was recorded as either negative/weak or moderate/strong. For both
antibodies, immunostaining of tissue sections was performed on the DAKO Autostainer with the DAKO
ARK (animal research kit) peroxidase (Dako Cytomation, Copenhagen, Denmark) as detection system.
Antigen localization was achieved using the DAB diaminobenzidine peroxidase reaction, counterstained
with hematoxylin.
Fractionation of Conditioned Media and Identification of Prosaposin
[0398]            Volumes of 500mL were collected of PC3 and PC3M-LN4 conditioned media from cells
grown in serum free RPMI media for 16 hours. The conditioned media was centrifuged to remove any
cells or cell debris for 5 minutes at 3,000rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. Conditioned media was then
loaded onto a 1OmL Heparin-Cu2 1 sepharose column at Iml/min. The column was washed with 1OOmL
lOmM NaPO 4, 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4. The column was subsequently washed with 50mL lOmM NaPO 4,
2M NaCl, pH 7.4; 50mL lOmM NaPO 4, 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4; 50mM 10mM NaPO 4, 15OmL NaCl,
lOmM imidazole, pH 7.4, and finally 50mL lOmM NaPO4 , 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4. Following these wash
steps, the remaining bound proteins were eluted at ImL/min in lOmM NaPO 4 , lOmM imidazole, pH 7.4
with a linear gradient of NaCl ranging from 0.3M to 2M with fractions collected in 0.05M NaCl
increments. The fractions were then dialyzed against lOmM NaPO4 , 150mL NaCl, pH 7.4 to remove
excess NaCl and imidazole.
[0399]            The fractions were then tested for activity by adding imL to serum starved prostate or
lung fibroblasts in 9mL of DMEM containing 0.1% FBS for 12 hours. The fibroblasts were then prepped
for western blot analysis as described above. Fractions containing Tsp-I stimulating activity were
concentrated using centriplus-10 columns (Millipore, MA, USA) and submitted to the Children's
Hospital Proteomics Center for tandem liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis. The lists of

proteins present in all the active fractions was then cross compared to identify proteins present in all
active fractions.
Prosaposin Purification
[0400]            Prosaposin was cloned into pLNCX acceptor vector (Clontech) including a C-terminal
6X-HN tag. PC3M-LN4 cells were then retrovirally transduced with this construct and subsequent to
selection using G418 were serum starved cells for 12 hours and collected 500mL of conditioned media.
The conditioned media was then incubated with 5mL Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech) for 1hr at 40 C.
The solution was then centrifuged at 2,000xG in an SS-34 rotor for 10 minutes and the supernatant
removed. The beads were then resuspended in 10mM NaPO 4 , 150mM NaCl, pH8.0 and loaded into a
lOmL Econo-column (Bio-Rad). The column was then washed first with 100mL 10mM NaPO 4, 150mM
NaCl, pH8.0 and subsequently with 10mM NaPO 4, 150mM NaCl, 25mM imidazole pH8.0. The
remaining bound proteins were then eluted from the column with a step gradient of 50-500mM imidazole
in 10mM NaPO4 , 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4. Fractions were analyzed for Prosaposin expression and purity
by western blot and SYPRO Ruby staining, respectively. Prosaposin containing fractions were then
dialyzed against 10mM NaPO 4 , 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4 and concentrated as described above.
[0401]            Tail vein metastasis
[0402]            Wild-type and Tsp-1-/- C57BL/6J mice were pretreated with 500gL of serum-free
conditioned media from PC3 or PC3shPsap cells or serum-free RPMI media for 10 days via
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. On the 10th day mice were injected via tail vein, with 1x106 Lewis Lung
Carcinoma cells. Subsequently, i.p. injections of serum-free tumor cell conditioned media or control
RPMI were performed for 19 additional days, at which point the animals were sacrificed. The lungs were
photographed and the number of visible metastatic nodules was counted by eye.
Example 1. Tsp-i expression is inversely related to metastatic potential
[0403]            The initial step of metastasis is dependent on access to the vasculature or lymphatic
system. Metastatic human tumors may differ in the relative of expression of pro- and anti-angiogenic
proteins compared to non-metastatic tumors. Thus, the level of VEGF secretion by the weakly metastatic
prostate cancer cell line PC3 and a metastatic derivative PC3M-LN4 as well as by the breast cancer cell
line MDA-MB-231 and a bone-specific metastatic derivative MDA-MET were measured. PC3M-LN4
cells have been documented to metastasize to multiple organs, including lymph node, liver, lung and
bone, while MDA-MET was derived to metastasize only to bone via intra-cardiac injection (Bendre et al.,
2002; Pettaway et al., 1996).
[0404]            Highly metastatic PC3M-LN4 cells and MDA-MET cells secreted lower levels of VEGF
than their parental counterparts, as measured by ELISA (Figure 1A). Even under hypoxic conditions (1%
02), the relative levels remained unchanged with the parental cells secreting more VEGF than their more
metastatic derivatives (Figure 1A). The levels of other angiogenic proteins such as bFGF, TG50I, and
PDGF secreted by the tumor cells were analyzed but no significant differences was found between the
metastatic and non-metastatic cells (data not shown).
                                                    77

     WO 2011/084685                                                                 PCT/US2010/061007
[0405]           Next, an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis, Tsp-i, was determined to ascertain
whether metastatic tumor cells express lower levels of Tsp-I than their non- metastatic counterparts. As
determined by western blot analysis, Tsp-i levels decreased as the metastatic potential of the cell lines
increased (Figure IB). The non-metastatic PC3 cells expressed high levels of Tsp-I while their
metastatic PC3M-LN4 derivatives expressed no detectable Tsp-i. This analysis was extended to the
breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MET. Consistent with the expression levels in the
prostate cancer cells, the weakly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line also expressed higher
levels of Tsp-i than its bone-specific metastatic derivative MDA-MET (Figure 1B). This indicated an
inverse relationship between metastatic potential and Tsp-i expression.
Example 2. Myc expression is directly related to metastatic potential
[0406]           It has been demonstrated that c-myc is often amplified or overexpressed in several types
of human cancer, including prostate and breast cancer (Escot et al., 1986; Nag and Smith, 1989).
Furthermore, c-Myc represses the expression of Tsp-i (Janz et al., 2000; Ngo et al., 2000; Tikhonenko et
al., 1996; Watnick et al., 2003). Therefore, the levels of c-Myc were analyzed to determine whether the
levels of c-Myc increase as tumors progress to the metastatic phenotype. The levels of c-Myc increase
with the metastatic potential of both prostate and breast cancer cells were examined. Protein expression
of c-Myc was significantly increased in the highly metastatic PC3M-LN4 and MDA-MET cells as
compared to the parental PC3 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 1B). Furthermore, levels of
phosphorylated c-Myc, which have been shown to be directly involved in Tsp-I repression (Watnick et
al., 2003), were also significantly increased in the metastatic cell lines (Figure IC). Hence, the levels of
Tsp-i could be attributable to the effects of Myc protein expression.
Example 3. Expression of Tsp-i in primary tumors
[0407]           In order to determine whether levels of Tsp-I observed in in vitro culture conditions
were representative of their expression levels in vivo, 2xI06 PC3 and their metastatic derivatives, PC3M
LN4 cells, were injected orthotopically into the prostate glands of SCID mice. Five weeks after injection
the tumors and surrounding tissue were analyzed for Tsp-i expression via western blot analysis and
immunohistochemistry. The prostate tumors formed by both PC3 and PC3M-LN4 cells were
histologically characterized by significant nuclear atypia and a diffuse infiltrating growth pattern, i.e.,
poorly differentiated, often surrounding benign prostate glands. Strong Tsp-i staining was observed in
fibrous stroma surrounding the invading tumor cells in 14 out of 17 PC3 tumors (Figure IF) but in only
one out of 16 PC3M-LN4 prostate tumors (Figure IF). Conversely, undetectable Tsp-i staining was
observed in the fibrous stroma surrounding the remaining tumors (3/17 PC3 and 15/16 PC3M-LN4
tumors (Figure IF). Significantly, analysis of Thrombospondin-2 (Tsp-2) and Endostatin expression by
western blot analysis revealed no elevation in PC3 primary tumors relative to normal tissue (Figure 8).
[0408]           Consistent with the immunohistochemistry results, four of five PC3 tumors examined
expressed high levels of Tsp-I and low/undetectable, levels of c-Myc by western blot (Figure ID).
Conversely, western blot analyses revealed that four out of four representative PC3M-LN4 tumors
                                                  78

    WO 2011/084685                                                                 PCT/US2010/061007
expressed low levels of Tsp-I and high levels of c-Myc (Figure ID). However, one of the PC3 tumors
analyzed by western blot expressed low levels of Tsp-I and high levels of c-Myc (Figure ID, P5).
Strikingly, this PC3 tumor was one of only two PC3 tumors that formed lung metastases (data not
shown).
[0409]           The level of VEGF secreted by the host stroma in these tumors was analyzed using a
murine specific VEGF ELISA that does not recognize the human form of the protein secreted by the
tumor cells themselves. Surprisingly, but in keeping with the in vitro observations, 4 out of 5 PC3
tumors sampled contained higher levels of stromal (murine) VEGF than the 4 sampled tumors formed by
the PC3M-LN4 cells (Figure 1E). Significantly, the one metastatic PC3 tumor that did not express higher
levels of VEGF also expressed low levels of Tsp-I as determined by immunohistochemistry and western
blot (Figure ID), thus indicating that repression of Tsp-i obviates the requirements for high levels of
VEGF in tumor metastasis.
Example 4. Expression of Tsp-i in metastases
[0410]           Having determined that reduced Tsp-I expression favored primary growth, the
expression of Tsp-i in distant tissue sites was determine to ascertain if similar reduction of expression of
Tsp-i in distant tissue sites was correlated with the growth of metastases.   The lungs from mice injected
orthotopically with PC3 and PC3M-LN4 cells were analyzed. The lung metastases were distributed in
both central and peripheral lung tissues, and in a few cases as small subpleural tumor cell clusters. The
lung metastases harbored only a minimal amount of stroma compared with corresponding prostate
tumors, but scattered stromal cells were identified within the metastases.
[0411]           As determined by immunohistochemical analyses, metastatic colonies formed by the
PC3 and PC3M-LN4 cells contained undetectable to very low levels of Tsp-I in the infiltrating stroma
(data not shown). Moreover, the PC3M-LN4 cells formed metastases with much greater efficiency than
the parental PC3 cells, 10/16 mice injected with PC3M-LN4 cells had detectable metastatic colonies in
their lungs while only 2/17 mice injected with PC3 cells had detectable metastatic colonies in their lungs.
The frequency of lymph node metastases was virtually identical. Large lymph node metastases were
detected in 12/16 mice injected with PC3M-LN4 cells and the two PC3 tumors that metastasized to lung
also metastasized to lymph node (Figure IF, table 1).
[0412]           Significantly, the metastatic colonies formed by the two cell types were almost identical
with respect to their expression levels of Tsp-i. We observed that the two mice with lung metastases
from PC3 tumors were in the group of three mice that harbored primary tumors with low levels of
stromal Tsp-i expression (Figure IF, PC3-5). Furthermore, 10/15 PC3M-LN4 tumors that expressed low
levels of stromal Tsp-I gave rise to metastatic colonies. Strikingly, of the fifteen primary tumors that
expressed high levels of Tsp-I (14 PC3 tumors and I PC3M-LN4 tumor, designated #9) none gave rise to
metastatic colonies, suggesting that stromal Tsp-i expression at the primary site is an indicator of
metastatic potential (Figure ID and F, table 1). Moreover, all metastases that formed showed low levels
                                                  79

    WO 2011/084685                                                                  PCT/US2010/061007
of Tsp-I expression in the metastasis-associated stroma. Indeed, the few metastases formed by the
generally non-metastatic PC3 cells also lacked stromal Tsp-i expression.
Example 5. Effects of tumor cells on fibroblasts in vitro
[0413]            The regulation of stromal Tsp-I by human tumor cells could be the result of a
unidirectional paracrine signaling event or a reciprocal signaling system involving both tumor cells and
nearby stromal fibroblasts. In order to determine which signaling system was involved, it was necessary
to create an in vitro tissue culture system that recapitulates the in vivo observations. To that end, human
prostate (PrF) and mammary fibroblasts (a gift of Dr. Kornelia Polyak, Dana Farber Cancer Institute,
Boston, MA) was treated with conditioned media from metastatic and non-metastatic prostate and breast
cancer cell lines, respectively.
[0414]            Treatment of fibroblasts with conditioned media from non-metastatic PC3 prostate and
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines stimulated Tsp-i expression 4-fold (as determined by band
volume density) (Figure 2A and B). Conversely, treatment of prostate fibroblasts with conditioned media
from the metastastic PC3M-LN4 line resulted in a 3-fold suppression of Tsp-I protein expression (Figure
2A). Hence, non-metastatic PC-3 cells actively induced Tsp-I expression above its normal basal levels,
while metastatic PC3M-LN4 actively suppressed Tsp-i below its normal levels.
[0415]            The conditioned media from MDA-MET cells stimulated Tsp-I expression in mammary
fibroblasts. Furthermore, when these tumor cells were co-cultured with mammary fibroblasts in a
transwell apparatus, the level of Tsp-I expression in the fibroblasts was still not repressed by MDA-MET
cells (Figure 2B). While the MDA-MET cells are portrayed as being metastatic, in fact they do not
metastasize from orthotopic sites of injection and instead do so only following intracardiac injection.
Thus, in consonance with the fact that MDA-MET cells do not metastasize when injected into the
mammary fat pad, these cells are unable to repress Tsp-i expression in mammary fibroblasts.
[0416]            The role of stromal Tsp-i repression was strengthened by the observation that the level
of VEGF secretion induced in PrFs by the conditioned media from the PC3M-LN4 tumor cells was lower
than that induced by the conditioned media from the PC3 cells (Figure 2C). These data recapitulate the
in vivo observations and suggest that repression of Tsp-I at both the primary and metastatic sites may be
a more critical event for tumor growth than the stimulation of VEGF secretion. Furthermore, the
stimulation of stromal Tsp-i by PC3 cells, despite the concomitant stimulation of VEGF, suggests that
Tsp-i is a potent inhibitor of metastasis even in such cases when the tumor itself is angiogenic.
[0417]            In addition to repressing stromal Tsp-i production in the primary tumor, it was
demonstrated that Tsp-I expression was also suppressed in sites of pulmonary metastasis formation. The
ability of metastasizing cancer cells to also repress Tsp-i production in the fibroblasts forming the stroma
was determined in two favored sites of metastasis - the lungs and the bone marrow. Human lung and
bone marrow derived fibroblasts were treated with conditioned media from PC3, PC3M-LN4, MDA
MB-231 and MDA-MET cells. Consistent with their ability to metastasize to both lung and bone, western
blot analysis revealed that PC3M-LN4 cells repressed Tsp-I expression in both types of fibroblasts
                                                   80

    WO 2011/084685                                                                 PCT/US2010/061007
(Figure 2D). Also, consistent with their bone-specific metastatic potential, MDA-MET cells only
repressed Tsp-I in bone marrow- derived fibroblasts and not in lung fibroblasts (Figure 2E). Strikingly,
rather than repressing Tsp-i expression, the non-metastatic PC3 and MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated Tsp
1 expression in both lung and bone marrow- derived fibroblasts (Figure 2D and E). Finally, neither
PC3M-LN4 nor MDA-MET was able to repress Tsp-i in fibroblasts from tissues to which they do not
metastasize, such as skin, brain, and in the case of PC3M-LN4, breast (Figure 9). These observations
held two implications. First, cancer cells can successfully repress Tsp-i expression in the stromal
fibroblasts of tissues in which they succeed in forming metastases. Second, the fibroblasts in different
tissues, although superficially similar, are biologically heterogeneous, in that some are and some are not
responsive to these Tsp-I-repressing signals.
Example 6. Identification of a Prosaposin as a Tsp-i stimulating protein
[0418]            In order to determine the mechanism by which PC3 cells were able to stimulate the
expression of p53 and consequently Tsp-i in stromal fibroblasts, a proteomic analysis of the proteins
secreted by PC3 cells was undertaken. The first step was to fractionate the conditioned media over a
heparin-Cu2+ sepharose column with increasing concentrations of NaCl in the presence of imidazole
(Shing, 1988). Subsequently, we treated both prostate and lung fibroblasts with the fractionated media
and analyzed Tsp-I expression by western blot analysis. Three fractions, eluting between 0.7 and 0.9M
NaCl in the presence of iOmM imidazole contained an activity that stimulated Tsp-i expression in
prostate and lung fibroblasts (Figure 3A and B).
[0419]            The Tsp-I-inducing fractions were concentrated and submitted them for tandem liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis. The LC/MS analysis revealed that only two
proteins were present in all of the active fractions, Prosaposin and Fetuin A (Table 3). Western blot
analysis of cell lysates and conditioned media from both PC3 and PC3M-LN4 cells revealed that
Prosaposin (Psap), was expressed at -10-fold higher levels in PC3 cells than in PC3M-LN4 cells (Figure
3C), while there was no significant difference between the two cell populations in Fetuin A expression
(data not shown). Significantly, it was observed that metastatic derivatives of the MDA-MB-231 cell
line also expressed significantly lower levels of Psap (Figure 3D) than the parental, weakly metastatic,
MDA-MB-231 cells
[0420]            To determine whether Prosaposin was the protein responsible for stimulating Tsp-i
expression in stromal fibroblasts, PC3 cells were transduced with lentiviral constructs specifying five
different shRNAs targeted to Psap. It was confirmed via western blot analysis that four of these hairpin
sequences suppressed the expression of Psap expressed by PC3 cells (Figure 3E, #1, 2, 4, and 5).
Significantly, suppression of Psap expression had no effect on the expression of Tsp-i by PC3 cells
themselves (Figure 3E). Normal human prostate and WI-38 lung fibroblasts were subsequently treated
with the conditioned media from the five cell populations expressing the various Psap shRNA sequences
and assessed Tsp-i expression. Western blot analysis revealed that the conditioned media from the four
cell populations in which Psap had been suppressed no longer stimulated Tsp-I in PrF and WI-38 cells
                                                   81

    WO 2011/084685                                                                PCT/US2010/061007
(Figure 3F and G). In contrast, treatment of prostate and lung fibroblasts with conditioned media from
PC3 cells with the weakest knockdown of Prosaposin (#3) still stimulated Tsp-I expression (Figure 3F
and G).
[0421]           In order to confirm the role of Psap as a stimulator of Tsp-i, the PC3M-LN4 cells, which
normally do not express significant levels of Psap, was transduced with a retroviral construct specifying
Psap (Figure 3H). Treatment of normal human prostate fibroblasts with conditioned media from these
Psap-overexpressing PC3M-LN4 cells reversed their normal ability to repress Tsp-I (Figure 31). Finally,
a 6x-HN-tagged version of prosaposin was purified using a Talon metal affinity resin. Treatment of
prostate fibroblasts with purified prosaposin resulted in the stimulation of Tsp-I expression (-5-fold),
confirming that Prosaposin sufficed, on its own, to elicit the previously observed increase in Tsp-i
expression (Figure 3J).
Example 7. Role ofp53 in stromal Tsp-i regulation
[0422]           In order to determine the mechanism by which tumor cells regulate Tsp-1, the tumor
suppressor p53 was studied. It has been demonstrated that the tumor suppressor p53 is a transcriptional
activator of Tsp-i in human fibroblasts (Dameron et al., 1994). Thus, the relative p53 expression levels
in the stroma of PC3 and PC3M-LN4 tumors were determined via western blot analysis. Both PC3 and
PC3M-LN4 contain deletion mutations in the p53 gene (Isaacs et al., 1991), resulting in the absence of
detectable p53 protein in both cell types. The immunohistochemical analysis of p53 tumor expression is
therefore simplified by the lack of contribution from the tumor cells themselves.
[0423]           The analyses of PC3 and PC3M-LN4 tumors revealed a significant association between
p53 and Tsp-i expression levels in tumor- associated stromal cells. Of 7 cases with strong Tsp-i staining,
6 cases had strong p53 staining. Correspondingly, of 7 cases with weak or negative Tsp-i staining, 6
cases had negative/weak p53 staining (Fisher's exact test, one-sided: p=0.015) (data not shown).
Consistent with the immunohistochemical observations, western blot analysis revealed that p53
expression was markedly elevated in the tumor stroma of PC3 primary tumors but undetectable in
PC3M-LN4 tumors (Figure 4A). Hence, the non-metastasizing PC3 tumors could induce both p53 and
Tsp-i expression in the tumor-associated stroma, while the metastasizing PC3M-LN4 cells had no such
effect.
[0424]           Significantly, the p53 expression was stimulated in the proximal lumbar lymph nodes
from mice bearing PC3 tumors despite the fact that there were no lymph node metastases. In contrast,
lymph nodes from mice bearing PC3M-LN4 tumors expressed p53 at levels similar to normal lymph
nodes (Figure 4B). These observations provided the first suggestion that PC3 tumors secrete a protein
that not only stimulates p53 in a paracrine fashion in the stroma of the primary tumor but also stimulates
p53 expression in distal tissues via some type of endocrine signaling, a mechanism that is described in
more detail below.
[0425]           Having determined that p53 protein levels were elevated in the stroma of PC3 tumors,
the inventors determined if p53 stimulation could be responsible for the increased expression of Tsp-i.
                                                  82

    WO 2011/084685                                                                PCT/US2010/061007
Cultured prostate fibroblasts (PrFs) were treated with conditioned media from either the PC3 or PC3M
LN4 cells and assessed the change in p53 protein levels via western blot analysis. Consistent with the
immunohistochemical and western blot results of the tumor-associated stroma, PC3- conditioned media
stimulated p53 protein levels in PrFs, while PC3M-LN4- conditioned media induced a modest repression
of p53 in PrF's (Figure 4C). Hence, in parallel with earlier analyses of Tsp-i expression, non-metastatic
cells induced p53 levels while metastatic cells caused their repression.
[0426]           The p53 expression was silenced in both prostate and lung fibroblasts via lentiviral
transduction of a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequence targeted to p53 (Brummelkamp et al., 2002). As
expected, treatment of these cells with conditioned media from PC3 cells failed to stimulate p53 (Figure
4D and E). More significantly conditioned media from PC3 cells failed to stimulate Tsp-I expression in
fibroblasts in which p53 had been silenced (Figure 4D and E). These results demonstrate that stimulation
of Tsp-i in fibroblasts by PC3 cells is p53-dependent.
[0427]           Could Prosaposin also function as a p53-stimulating protein? Prostate and lung
fibroblasts were treated with conditioned media from the five populations of PC3shPsap cells described
above. As observed for Tsp-I expression, silencing of Psap also reversed the ability of PC3 cells to
stimulate p53 expression (Figure 4F and G). Of note is the observation that the one shRNA sequence
that did not suppress Psap in PC3 cells (#3) still stimulated p53 in both prostate and lung fibroblasts
(Figure 4F and G). Moreover, overexpression of Psap in PC3M-LN4 cells reversed the ability to repress
p53 in prostate fibroblasts (Figure 4H) and treatment of prostate fibroblasts with purified recombinant
Psap stimulated p53 expression (Figure 41). These data confirm that Psap stimulates p53 expression and
as a result induces the stimulation of Tsp-I expression.
Example 8. Prosaposin expression is negatively regulated by Myc
[0428]           The metastatic PC3M-LN4 cells express lower levels of Psap than the non-metastatic
parental PC3 cells.   In addition, the PC3 cells express lower levels of Myc than their metastatic
derivative PC3M-LN4, indicating that Psap expression might be negatively regulated by Myc. To
examine this possibility, PC3 cells were transduced with a retroviral construct specifying a Myc-Estrogen
Receptor (ER) fusion protein, which is activated upon administration of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-HT)
(Littlewood et al., 1995). Upon treatment of PC3-MycER cells with 4-HT and resulting induction of
Myc function, there was a significant reduction (4-fold) in Psap levels (Figure 5A). Furthermore,
conditioned media from the 4-HT-treated PC3MycER cells failed to stimulate the expression of either
p53 or Tsp-I in lung or prostate fibroblasts, while conditioned media from untreated PC3MycER cells
stimulated both p53 and Tsp-I expression in these two cell types (Figure 5B).
[0429]           To further explored the connection between Myc and Psap expression, Myc expression
in PC3M-LN4 cells were silenced via lentiviral transduction of an shRNA construct that specifically
antagonizes c-Myc expression. Two shRNA sequences directed against Myc that were able to achieve
significant knockdown of Myc protein expression were identified (4- and 8-fold, respectively) (Figure
5C). Indeed, these two cell lines expressed higher levels (>3- and 6-fold, respectively) of Psap than
                                                  83

    WO 2011/084685                                                                  PCT/US2010/061007
PC3M-LN4 cells, as determined via western blot analysis (Figure 5D). Consistent with Psap
overexpression, conditioned media from the PC3M-LN4shMyc cells no longer repressed Tsp-I
expression in lung and prostate fibroblasts (Figure 5E). Taken together these data indicate that Myc is a
negative regulator of Psap expression in these tumor cells.
Example 9. Loss of Prosaposin stimulates tumor metastasis
[0430]            Given Psap's ability to stimulate p53 and Tsp-I expression in prostate and lung
fibroblasts, it was speculated that it might also inhibit the metastatic potential of PC3 cells in vivo. To
test this hypothesis, 2x106 PC3shPsap cells that demonstrated the greatest knockdown of Psap expression
(Figure 3E: #4) and PC3pLKO control cells were injected, independently, into the prostate glands of
SCID mice. It was observed that six of seven tumors formed by PC3shPsap cells gave rise to large
lymph node metastases whereas none of the eight tumors generated from PC3pLKO vector controls cells
gave rise to metastases (data not shown). Significantly, the tumors that arose from PC3shPsap cells
formed metastases with a similar frequency to PC3M-LN4 cells (6/7 vs. 12/15), albeit with increased
latency of 8-9 weeks as compared to 5-6 weeks. Of greater significance is the fact that, although one of
the shPsap tumors grew significantly larger than the PC3pLKO tumors, three of the smaller shPsap
tumors (Figure 6A: #4, 5, and 7), which grew to approximately the same size as the PC3pLKO control
tumors, formed visible lymph node metastases (data not shown). These data indicated that reduction of
Psap expression, achieved in this instance by use of an shRNA, significantly potentiated the ability of
otherwise-non-metastatic tumor cells to form lymph nodes metastases.
[0431]            Could the suppression of Prosaposin expression abrogated the stimulation of p53 and
Tsp-i previously observed in PC3 tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis of p53 and Tsp-i expression
in the primary tumors formed by PC3 and PC3shPsap tumors revealed that p53 expression in the tumor
associated stromal cells of PC3shPsap tumors was completely negative (n=4) (data not shown), in
contrast to the behavior of PC3 control tumors in which p53 expression was significantly stimulated.
Regarding Tsp-i staining, most PC3shPsap tumors were weak or negative within the central parts of the
tumors, whereas occasional moderate staining was observed in the periphery, corresponding to the
invasive border, but independent of p53 expression (n=4/10) (data not shown).
[0432]            These results were supported by western blot analysis of the tumors formed by
PC3shPsap cells, which revealed no stimulation of either p53 or Tsp-i in the tumor stroma (Figure 6B).
Western blot analysis of 4 representative tumors revealed that PC3shPsap tumors no longer stimulated
p53 or Tsp-I expression in lymph node or lung tissue of mice bearing these tumors (Figure 6C and D).
Taken together these findings strongly indicate that Psap functions as a repressor of both lymphatic and
vascular metastasis by inducing p53 and consequently Tsp-I expression in stromal fibroblasts via both
paracrine and endocrine signaling mechanisms. In addition, when Psap-suppressed cancer cells
metastasized to lymph nodes, they were surrounded by stromal cells that similarly lacked p53 and Tsp-I
expression.
Example 10. Tsp-i expression is required for Prosaposin-mediated suppression of metastasis

    WO 2011/084685                                                                  PCT/US2010/061007
[0433]             Is Tsp-i expression required for Prosaposin-mediated suppression of lung metastasis in
vivo? Tsp-1-/- mice (Lawler et al., 1998) were used to answer this question. Earlier observations have
shwon that Prosaposin could act systemically to influence the levels of both Tsp-i and p53 in distant
organs (Fig 6C and D). Both wild-type C57BL/6J and Tsp-1-/- mice from the same genetic background
were pretreated with RPMI media or conditioned media from PC3pLKO or PC3shPsap cells for 10 days;
these serum-free media were injected at daily intervals into the peritoneal space of these animals. On the
tenth day, ixi06 syngeneic Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cells were injected via tail vein into wild-type
and Tsp-1-/- mice that were treated as described above or with control RPMI media alone. Nineteen days
after tail vein injection, these mice were sacrificed and examined the lungs, in which many of the LLC
cells were presumably trapped.
[0434]             It was observed that the lungs of wild-type mice treated with RPMI alone were riddled
with metastases, containing an average of 30 metastatic colonies per lung (Figure 7A). Strikingly, it was
also observed that the lungs of wild-type mice treated with PC3pLKO-conditioned media contained, on
average only 2 metastatic colonies, more than 15-fold fewer than control media-treated mice (Figure 7A).
Conversely, the lungs of mice treated with conditioned media from PC3shPsap cells resembled the
control mice with respect to the number of metastases, containing 27 metastatic nodules per lung on
average (Figure 7A). This supported the notion that the PC3 cells released a substance that could actively
suppress metastasis formation by these LLC cells.
[0435]             Consistent with a requirement for Tsp-1, the number of metastases observed in the lungs
of tsp-1-/- mice treated with conditioned media from PC3pLKO and PC3shPsap cells was virtually
identical (10.25 vs 10.7) compared to 9.7 in the control mice (Figure 7A). Hence, in the absence of Tsp
I production by the host, the factor(s) released by PC3 cells failed to suppress metastasis formation by
LLC cells. The observed lower numbers of metastases in the Tsp-I KO mice compared with their wild
type counterparts was apparently related to compensatory Tsp-2 production induced by LLC cells in
these mice, a phenomenon not observed in human tumors (Figures 10 and 11).
[0436]             Of interest is whether Prosaposin is differentially expressed in metastatic and localized
human prostate cancer. A microarray gene expression data set was gathered from 55 patient samples
consisting of normal prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), localized primary prostate tumors and
metastatic prostate tumors (Dhanasekaran et al., 2001) and the data were analyzed. Consistent with the
xenograft experiments, it was discovered that relative psap mRNA expression (normalized to normal,
benign prostate tissue) was -40% lower, on average, in the metastatic tumors as compared with localized
primary tumors with a p value <0.0001 (Figure 7B). Analysis of this same data set revealed that the
relative tsp-i mRNA expression was, on average, -50% lower in the metastatic tumors, also with a p
value <0.0001 (Figure 7C). Finally, the relative expression of p53 was -35% lower in metastatic tumors
compared to localized tumors, with a p value of 0.0004 (Figure 7D). These expression data support the
results obtained in the experiments and demonstrate that in metastatic human tumors expression of
                                                   85

    WO 2011/084685                                                               PCT/US2010/061007
Prosaposin is suppressed compared to non-metastatic tumors. Taken together these data indicate that
Prosaposin functions as a suppressor of tumor metastasis (Figure 7E).
Example 11. Saposin A stimulates Tsp-1
[0437]           Truncation mutants of Prosaposin comprised of SaposinA, SaposinAB, and SaposinABC
downstream of the native signal sequence of Prosaposin that mediates secretion of the protein. These
mutants were created by PCR of Prosaposin using the following primers: Saposin A: 5' Primer: 5'
ggcggcTCAGTCGACGGTACCGG-3' (SEQ. ID. No.9) which primes at the 5' region of the pDNR-Dual
MCS, the vector where the cDNA of Psap is subcloned into, 3' Primer:5'
ggcgcctctagaAGAGACTCGCAGAGGTTGAG-3'                  (SEQ. ID. No.10). Saposin AB: 5' Primer: 5'
ggcggcTCAGTCGACGGTACCGG-3'(SEQ. ID. No. 9) and 3' Primer:5'
ggcgcctctagaACCTCATCACAGAACCC-3'(SEQ. ID. No.11). Saposin ABC: 5' Primer: 5'
ggcggcTCAGTCGACGGTACCGG-3' (SEQ. ID. No.9) and 3' Primer:5'
ggcgcctctagaGCCAGAGCAGAGGTGCAGC-3'(SEQ. ID. No.12).
[0438]           The resulting PCR products were cloned into the SalI and XbaI sites of pDNR-dual. The
Saposin constructs were then transferred via Cre-recombinase mediated cloning into pCMVneo for
transient expression. These pCMVneoSaposin constructs were transiently transfected into the PC3M
LN4 prostate cancer cells. After 48 hours the conditioned media from these cells as well as cells infected
with pCMVneo alone were transferred to prostate and lung fibroblasts. After 12 hours the treated
fibroblasts were harvested and lysed and Tsp-i expression assessed by western blot analysis.
[0439]           It has been demonstrated that Psap inhibits metastasis via stimulation of Tsp-i
expression and this stimulation is via the tumor suppressor p53. In order to determine the active region of
the full-length Psap, constructs were created expressing truncation mutants specifying Saposin A,
Saposin AB, and Saposin ABC. Following transient transfection of PC3M-LN4 cells with these vectors,
prostate and lung fibroblasts were treated with the conditioned media from these cells. It was determined
that Saposin A is the minimal domain that is functionally required for the stimulation of Tsp-I in prostate
fibroblasts (Fig. 12).
Example 12. Psap in platelets and plasma as biomarker for metastasis
[0440]           Since the amount of Psap secreted by tumors depended on whether the tumor was
metastatic or non-metastatic, the Psap in platelets and plasma were determined for patients with either
tumor type. There was also a strong correlation between metastasis and the Psap level in the plasma
and/or platelets of patients with non-metastatic and metastatic cancers. Both plasma and platelets of
patients with non-metastatic cancers contained elevated levels of Psap compared to normal individuals
with no diagnosed cancers. Conversely, the plasma and platelets of patients with metastatic cancers
contain Psap levels that are comparable to normal individuals with no diagnosed cancers (Fig. 13).
[0441]           Moreover, high protein levels of endogenously expressed prosaposin in human prostate
cancer patients, as determined by immunohistochemical analysis significantly correlated with increased
survival and delayed time to cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy (Fig. 14A and B).

[0442]            Representative tumor areas from a tissue microarray were identified on HE slides, and
three tissue cylinders (diameter of 0.6 mm) were punched from the donor block and mounted into a
recipient paraffin block. Sections were stained for expression of Prosaposin using the antibody from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology described above. The tissue microarray was assembled from a consecutive
series of 104 men treated by radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer during 1988
1994, with long and complete follow-up, was included. Clinical stage T1/T2 disease, negative bone scan
and generally good health were the prerequisites for radical retropubic prostatectomy. The majority of
cancers in this series is clinical stage T2 and presented before the PSA era started in Norway in the mid
1990s. Consequently, the prevalence of adverse prognostic factors like capsular penetration, seminal
vesicle invasion and positive surgical margins is rather high compared with most contemporary series.
No patients treated by radical prostatectomy received radiotherapy prior to biochemical failure or clinical
recurrence.
[0443]            Postoperatively, s-PSA, loco-regional tumor recurrences, distant metastases, and patient
survival were recorded. Time from surgery until biochemical failure (defined as persistent or rising s
PSA level of > 0.5 ng/ml in two consecutive blood samples) was noted. Further, a tumor in the prostatic
fossa or evidence of distant metastasis on bone scan, X-ray or MRI was recorded as clinical recurrence.
The last time of follow-up was December 2001. Median follow-up time was 95 months (7.9 yrs). No
patients were lost because of insufficient data. 67 patients experienced biochemical failure, 31 patients
had clinical recurrence, and 9 patients died of prostate cancer.
[0444]            Over 100 years ago Stephen Paget published his "seed and soil" hypothesis, in which he
noted that tumors from certain organs tend to preferentially metastasize to specific organs due to the
compatibility between 'seed and soil' (Paget, 1889). The tissue specificity, or homing, of tumor cells to
their metastatic destination has since been demonstrated to be mediated in part by discrete chemokine
ligand-receptor interactions (Muller et al., 2001). However, the contributions of the tumor stroma at both
the primary and metastatic sites that regulate the growth of metastases subsequent to colonization has not
been as well documented.
[0445]            It has been previously demonstrated that, at the primary site, tumor growth beyond the
microscopic size is regulated by the levels of Tsp-I expressed by the epithelial tumor cells (Watnick et
al., 2003). Metastatic human tumor cells should be more angiogenic than their non/weakly metastatic
counterparts in the primary site, so as to have better access to their conduit, the vasculature and
lymphatics, as well as at metastatic sites to allow their growth beyond the microscopic size. Described
herein 14 of 17 tumors formed by the weakly metastatic PC3 cell line expressed high levels of Tsp-i. Of
the three PC3 tumors that expressed low levels of Tsp-i two formed lung metastases. Furthermore, 15 of
16 tumors formed by the highly metastatic PC3M-LN4 cell line expressed low levels of Tsp-i. Of the
fifteen PC3M-LN4 tumors that expressed low levels of Tsp-I ten, or two-thirds, developed lung
metastases. Finally, no primary tumors that expressed high levels of Tsp-i (0/15 combined) formed lung
metastases. Thus, high levels of Tsp-i in the stroma of primary tumors are a potent barrier to metastasis.

    WO 2011/084685                                                                  PCT/US2010/061007
[0446]            Described herein is a novel suppressor of tumor metastasis. It was demonstrated that
secretion of Psap by tumor cells inhibits metastasis by stimulating the expression of p53 and,
consequently, Tsp-I in stromal fibroblasts. Significantly, Psap, secreted by the primary tumor, also was
able to stimulate the expression of p53 in distal tissues, such as lymph node and lung. Furthermore, the
Psap-mediated stimulation of Tsp-i was a direct function of p53 activation as shRNA knockdown of p53
abolishes this stimulation. Additionally, it was determined that expression of Psap was not only repressed
in metastatic prostate cancer cells, but in several independently derived metastatic versions of the MDA
MB-231 cell line. These lines were derived to metastasize specifically to bone and lung, however they
all share the common trait of reduced expression of Psap. These observations indicate that repression of
Psap expression can be a common mechanism to enhance tumor metastasis, and can be a component of a
"metastatic switch".
[0447]            Additionally, by culturing tumor cells and fibroblasts from various tissues in a trans-well
tissue culture apparatus, it was possible to recapitulate our in vivo observations and extend them to
demonstrate that the ability to repress Tsp-I in stromal fibroblasts strictly correlates with the ability to
metastasize to the tissue from which the fibroblasts were derived. Specifically, PC3M-LN4 cells, which
have been reported to be able to metastasize to both lung and bone (Pettaway et al., 1996), can repress
Tsp-i in both lung fibroblasts and bone marrow derived stromal cells, while they are unable to repress
Tsp-i in mammary or dermal fibroblasts, or astrocytes. Coordinately, MDA-MET cells, which were
selected to metastasize solely to the bone (Bendre et al., 2002), are only able to repress Tsp-i in bone
marrow-derived stromal cells. These observations indicate that while repression of Tsp-i in the stroma of
the primary tumor is necessary for metastasis, repression of Tsp-i at the distal site determines tissue
specificity.
[0448]            The role of Psap in the inhibition of metastasis is confirmed by the formation of
metastases by tumors in which Psap expression has been suppressed via shRNA. Significantly, shPsap
tumors, with the exception of one, did not grow substantially larger than the parental PC3 tumors. These
findings indicate that Psap functions as an inhibitor of tumor metastasis and not of primary tumor growth.
The observation that repression of Psap expression also results in the formation of lymph node
metastases, accompanied by decreased Tsp-I expression in the node itself, is somewhat surprising as
lymph-angiogenesis and lymph node metastases have been demonstrated not to be affected by Tsp-I in a
murine model of skin cancer (Hawighorst et al., 2002).
[0449]            It was demonstrated here that escape from the primary site and growth at the metastatic
site is not only a function of tumor-secreted Tsp-i but also of the level of Tsp-i secreted by the tumor
associated stromal fibroblasts.
Example 13. Clinical Correlation of Psap, Tsp-i andp53 expression with metastasis
[0450]            The investigators analyzed the prosaposin protein levels in the serum of normal subjects
and colon cancer patients of varying stages. The prosaposin levels increased with grade TI-T4 and then
decreased back to normal levels in patients with metastasis (Fig. 15). Interestingly, patient H3 was
                                                   88

    WO 2011/084685                                                                PCT/US2010/061007
originally diagnosed as stage T4 with no mets (NOMO) yet subsequently developed both lymph node and
lung metastases and was reclassified as N2M1, which is consistent with the hypothesis that prosaposin
levels inversely correlate with metastatic progression. The fact that colon cancer is not a hormone
responsive cancer, like breast and prostate, strongly indicates that repression of prosaposin is a more
widespread event in metastatic disease.
[0451]            A study consisting of 104 men who were treated by radical prostatectomy for prostate
cancer (Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway) and 290 women who were treated with
complete hysterectomy for endometrial cancer was conducted. The study consisted of both with long and
complete follow-up. Immunohistochemical analysis of the prosaposin protein expression in a tissue
microarray revealed an association between low prosaposin and cancer specific survival (P=0.0471 by
log rank for prostate cancer and P<0.0001 by log rank for endometrial cancer) (Figs. 16A and 16B).
Example 14. Prosaposin stimulates Tsp-i and p53 via LRP-1 and PKC mediated signaling
mechanisms
[0452]            It has been demonstrated that Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor Related Protein (LRP)
can mediate the uptake of Prosaposin. Thus, in order to determine how prosaposin stimulates the
expression of Tsp-i and p53 prostate fibroblasts were treated with PC3 conditioned media (CM) in the
presence and absence of Receptor Associate Protein (RAP) a competitive inhibitor or LRP binding.
Western blot analysis revealed that in the presence of RAP PC3 CM no longer stimulated Tsp-I (Fig.
17A). It has also been demonstrated that ligation of LRP releases intracellular Ca2+ stores. To determine
whether prosaposin activated this pathway prostate fibroblasts were treated with CM from PC3 cells in
the presence and absence of the PKC inhibitor G6 6983. It was observed, via western blot analysis, that
inhibition of PKC abolished the stimulation of Tsp-I and p53 (Fig. 17B). Thus, it demonstrates that
prosaposin functions via the binding to an LRP family member.
[0453]            The expression of LRPi and LRP2 was then silenced, independently in WI-38 lung
fibroblasts, to determine the requirement for LRPi in mediating prosaposin functions and whether the
closely related protein LRP2 could substitute. As shown in Fig. 18, over 95% suppression of LRPi and
LRP2 mRNA with 2 different shRNA sequences were obtained and, importantly, knockdown of one did
not affect expression of the other.
[0454]            The cells were then treated with CM from PC3 cells and it was observed that the
silencing of LRP1 blocked the stimulation of Tsp-I expression while silencing of LRP2 had no effect on
Tsp-i stimulation by PC3 conditioned media (Fig. 19).
Example 15. A peptide within Saposin A is sufficient to stimulate Tsp-i
[0455]            In order to determine the domain of prosaposin that was required for the stimulation of
Tsp-i in fibroblasts PC3M-LN4 cells were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing truncated
mutants of prosaposin containing saposin A, saposin AB, saposin ABC, or saposin BCD. The lung
fibroblasts were then treated with the CM from these cells and it was observed that all of the constructs
containing saposin A, including the construct that only expressed saposin A, were sufficient to stimulate
                                                  89

    WO 2011/084685                                                               PCT/US2010/061007
Tsp-i expression in lung fibroblasts, while the construct specifying saposin BCD was unable to stimulate
Tsp-i (Fig. 20). Thus, it was concluded that saposin A is sufficient to stimulate Tsp-i in fibroblasts.
[0456]            Seven 20-amino acid (20-mer) peptides derived from saposin A were tested for ability to
stimulate Tsp-I expression in fibroblasts. These 20-mers spanned the 81 amino acid sequence of saposin
A, their ranges are as follows: amino acid 1-20, 10-30, 21-40, 31-50, 41-60, 51-70 and 61-81. WI-38
lung fibroblasts were treated with these peptides overnight and the Tsp-i expression was analyzed by
Western blot analysis. It was observed that only the peptide comprising amino acids 31-50 of saposin A
was able to stimulate Tsp-i expression (Fig. 21A). This 20-mer has the sequence
LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI (SEQ. ID. No. 29).
[0457]            Based on the sequence and crystal structure of saposin A and saposin C (Fig. 21B) a
cyclic 13 amino acid peptide was synthesized and tested. The cyclic 13-mer comprises amino acid
residues 35-47 of saposin A and is flanked at the N- and C-terminus by cysteines which form a disulfide
bond (CDWLPKPNMSASC, SEQ. ID. No. 37). It was determined that this peptide was sufficient to
stimulate Tsp-I and p53 (Fig. 22). It has been demonstrated that PKC can phosphorylate ckI (casein
kinase 1) and that ckI can regulate the interaction of p53 with MDM2 by phosphorylating MDM2. Thus,
WI-38 fibroblasts were treated with the cyclic 13-mer in the presence and absence of the casein kinase
inhibitor D4476. Western blot analysis revealed that the 13-mer induced the stimulation of p53 and Tsp
1 and the concomitant down regulation of MDM2, and inhibition of CKI by D4476 resulted in the
reduction of Tsp-i and p53 and increase in MDM2 protein levels (Fig. 22). Thus, the data indicate that
saposin A binds to LRPI through this 13 amino acid motif resulting in activation of a signal transduction
pathway leading from PKC to CKI culminating in a reduction of MDM2 levels and resultant increase in
p53 and Tsp-I protein levels.
Example 16. Prosaposin inhibits lymphatic endothelial cells migration
[0458]            It was demonstrated that silencing of prosaposin in PC3 cells enabled lymph node
metastasis. Thus, in vitro migration assays were performed in which lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC)
were plated on an 8mm pore membrane in the upper chamber of a transwell tissue culture apparatus. In
the bottom chamber prostate fibroblasts were plated alone or in combination with PC3, PC3shPsap,
PC3M-LN4 and PC3M-LN4-Psap cells. After 8 hours the bottom of the membrane were stained with
DAPI and the number of LECs per high-powered field that migrated across the membrane were counted.
It was observed that PC3 cells inhibited the migration of LECs by 2-fold, while silencing of Psap in these
cells resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in LEC migration. Similarly, PC3M-LN4 cells induced the migration
of 2-fold more LECs/field, while ectopic expression of Prosaposin in these cells virtually abolished the
stimulation of migration in a p53-dependent manner (Fig. 23).
[0459]            Next, primary prostate tumor xenografts were stained for podoplanin expression, a
marker for lymphatic vessels. It was found that tumors formed by PC3M-LN4 cells contained       -15-fold
more intratumoral lymphatic vessels than tumors formed by PC3M-LN4-psap cells (Figs. 24A and 24B).
                                                  90

[0460]             Finally, it was determined that prosaposin stimulates the expression of semaphorin 3F, a
transcriptional target of p53 and an inhibitor of metastasis and lymphangiogenesis, at the mRNA level
(Fig. 25).
Example 17. A 20-merpeptide derived from Saposin A stimulates Tsp-i production in vivo.
Treatment of mice with peptides:
[0461]             The 20-mer LEKTCDWLPKPNMSASCKEI (SEQ. ID. No. 29) was tested in vivo in
mice for their ability to induce Tsp-i expression. Four mice were treated with the 20-amino acid peptide
(residues 31-50 of saposin A) at a dose of 30mg/kg/day in combination with 200uL of conditioned media
(CM) from the metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC3M-LN4. The peptide was co-treated with CM to
mimic a tumor bearing mice, since PC3M-LN4 tumors have been shown to secrete a factor that represses
Tsp-i in the lungs of mice. Another four mice were treated with CM from PC3M-LN4 alone, and a
control group of four mice with treated with vehicle (PBS) alone. As a positive control, mice were also
treated with conditioned media from the non-metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC3, which has been
shown to express high levels of the full-length prosaposin protein. Mice were treated for 9 days after
which they were sacrificed and the lungs and livers were harvested and lysed. Tissue lysates were then
run on a 4-12% gradient bis-tris polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for
western blotting with antibodies specific for thrombospondin-i (Tsp-1) and P-actin.
[0462]             Fig. 26 shows that the 20-mer stimulated Tsp-i expression over control in the liver and
lung tissues. Treatment with PC3M-LN4 CM reduced the expression of Tsp-i in both the lungs of mice
but had no effect on the Tsp-i expression in the liver. Conversely, treatment with the 20-amino acid
peptide stimulated the expression of Tsp-i in the lung and liver by 6- and 4- fold, respectively compared
to PC3M-LN4 CM. Moreover, the level of stimulation was greater than that of the weakly metastatic
pancreatic cancer cell line PC3. These data validate the in vivo administration of the functional peptides
of Saposin A for inducing Tsp-I increased expression in vivo.
