Technical Field
[00011  The present invention generally relates to processes for hydrogenating carbon monoxide,
and more particularly relates to iron-based compositions for catalyzing such processes, and still
more particularly relates to the manufacture of hematite containing Fischer-Tropsch catalysts.
Description of Related Art
100021  The Fischer-Tropsch process is a well known catalyzed reaction in which carbon monoxide
and hydrogen are converted into various forms of hydrocarbons. Catalysts for the reaction are
commonly based on iron, sometimes using a precipitated iron-based catalyst that also contains
some type of promoter to improve catalyst stability or to affect the properties of the hydrocarbons
produced.
100031  U.S. Patent No. 5,504,118 describes Fischer-Tropsch reaction schemes using certain iron
catalysts promoted with potassium and copper in a slurry reactor to produce hydrocarbon products
having more than five carbon atoms, water, and alcohols.
100041  German Patent No. 763864 describes certain methods of making iron catalysts for
production of hydrocarbons from carbon monoxide and hydrogen under normal or increased
pressure (5-50 atm). The catalysts contain bi- and trivalent iron salts and up to 0.5% copper, and
are made by heating and precipitating the solutions.

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
10039]  Overview.     Herein disclosed are low temperature Fischer-Tropsch catalysts containing
hematite, methods for the production of such catalysts, and methods of producing Fischer-Tropsch
hydrocarbons with such catalysts. It has been unexpectedly discovered that specific amounts and
sizes of hematite beneficially affect the reducibility, run time stability, selectivity, productivity,
catalyst replacement rate, and attrition resistance of commercial Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. The
presence of hematite may also provide other benefits including, but not limited to, improved (i.e.
reduced) sodium content of the precipitate, thus facilitating removal thereof during catalyst
washing, and/or providing a filter cake with a higher solids content, thus enabling spray drying of
enhanced morphology spheres.
100401  Conventionally,    it  is expected     that low    temperature   precipitated    iron catalysts
predominantly form from 'hematite-free' ferri (oxy) hydroxide precipitates.          This has recently
again been demonstrated by Pretorius (Synthetic Liquids Production and Refining; de Klerk, A.,
et al.; ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC, 2011).                   Such
precipitates generally yield very small (i.e. less than 10 nm) iron crystallites with very high surface
area. However, it has been discovered that at least 35 percent of the surface area may be lost on
calcination. The novel hematite-containing catalyst disclosed herein provides calcined surface area
and pore structure similar to those of conventional hematite-free catalyst. Furthermore, it has been
discovered that, when freshly prepared filter cake (i.e. 'precipitate') is allowed to transform in
some degree to hematite, the surface characteristics of the resulting catalyst are similar to those of
conventional hematite-free catalyst.
100411  It has also been discovered that although the pore size and/or pore volume of the hematite
containing systems may initially decrease in the presence of low levels of hematite (e.g. about 1 to
10 weight percent hematite, the pore size and/or pore volume of hematite systems containing
higher levels of hematite (e.g. about 40 to 50 weight percent hematite) approach or equal that of
essentially hematite-free systems.    The BET surface area of higher hematite systems may be
similar to that of the BET surface area of hematite-free systems (e.g. slightly lower, such as, by
way of non-limiting example, less than about 10 percent lower than the BET surface area of
hematite-free systems).
100421  As described in more detail hereinbelow, it has been unexpectedly discovered that hematite
content and increasing crystallite size of freshly precipitated slurries can be beneficial to the
                                                     8

Fischer-Tropsch process.      Without wishing to be limited by theory, it is speculated that the
formation of increasing quantities of hematite and the size thereof creates voids and volumes
beneficial to Fischer-Tropsch catalysis, i.e. exposing Fischer-Tropsch active sites.       It has been
demonstrated (for example, Lox E.S. and Marin G.B., Applied Catalysis, 40 (1988) 197-218) that,
due to coverage by silicon and potassium oxides, only 3 percent of the iron in a precipitated iron
catalyst is typically exposed to the gas phase.        It is speculated that the formation of hematite
exposes more iron to benefit the reaction. The hematite content can be increased to up to 70 weight
percent, while the hematite crystallite size can be increased to between 1 and 70 nm, depending on
the slurry hold time.
100431  It has also been discovered that the temperature of reduction of the herein disclosed
hematite-containing catalyst is significantly lowered (e.g. 228'C) relative to the reduction
temperature of a hematite-free catalyst (e.g. about 246'C), and may indeed be below the
temperature at which the Fischer-Tropsch reaction utilizing the catalyst will ultimately be carried
out (e.g. about 240'C).
100441   Under typical run conditions (for example, 200'C to 270'C, 20 bar to 35 bar, and space
velocity (SV) of 1.5 to 6.0 Nltot/gcat), the herein disclosed Fischer-Tropsch catalyst may be resistant
to sintering, with surface-average carbide sizes that increase at rates of less than about 0.10
nm/hr, 0.05 nm/hr, 0.023 nm/hr, or even lower, and/or with volume-averaged carbide sizes that
increase at rates of less than about 0.10 nm/hr, 0.05 nm/hr, 0.033 nm/hr, or lower. The herein
disclosed Fischer-Tropsch catalyst exhibits a particle size distribution conforming to log-normal
distributions, the peak of which does not increase above 45, 40 nm, or 35 nm, during 1000, 1500,
or 2000 hours of operation.
100451  Elemental analysis of the herein-disclosed Fischer-Tropsch catalyst under typical run
conditions indicates that, in embodiments, the catalyst composition is substantially stable for times
on stream of at least 2000 hours, exhibiting little or substantially no change in promoter
composition, and hence no leaching of promoters from the catalyst, during the run period.
10046]  Method of Making FT Catalyst. Herein disclosed is a method of making a hematite
containing Fischer-Tropsch catalyst. In embodiments, the method comprises combining an iron
nitrate solution with a precipitating agent solution at a precipitating temperature to form a
precipitate comprising iron phases; aging the precipitate by holding the precipitation mixture at a
hold temperature for a hold time in order to allow hematite transformation. In embodiments, the
                                                     9

hold time is greater than or equal to about 5, 10, 15, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, or 90
minutes to provide an aged precipitate. In embodiments, the hold time is greater than or equal to
about 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, or 90 minutes to provide an aged precipitate.
10047]    In embodiments, the iron nitrate solution is prepared from spent 'scrap' iron sources. In
embodiments, the iron nitrate solution is prepared from commercially available fine iron powder.
In embodiments, the iron nitrate solution is prepared such that all or some percentage of the
solution comprises Fe2+(ferrous nitrate). In embodiments, the iron nitrate solution is prepared such
that all or some percentage of the solution comprises Fe3 * (ferric nitrate).     In embodiments, a
commercially available Fe2+ or Fe3+ solution is utilized as the acid. In embodiments, commercially
available ferrous and ferric nitrate solutions are combined to produce the desired acid solution.
100481    In embodiments, the temperature of precipitation or a combination of precipitation
temperature and hold time at the precipitation temperature are varied to induce hematite formation.
In some embodiments, the hot, freshly precipitated slurry is allowed to cool, i.e. without forced
cooling, or with controlled cooling, to induce the desired amount of hematite. In embodiments,
one or more promoters are added prior to or directly following precipitation in order to induce
hematite formation.    The one or more promoters may be selected from aluminum, chromium,
manganese, silica, copper, zinc, zirconium, additives including, but not limited to, the amino acid
cysteine and thiols, including, but not limited to, n-BuSH and iBu-SH, and combinations thereof.
In embodiments, the one or more promoter is selected from colloidal acidic silica, basic silica,
waterglass (i.e. sodium silicate, Na2SiO3), and potassium water glass (i.e. potassium silicate,
K 2 SiO 3 ). In embodiments, the hematite promoter comprises one or more component selected
from alumina, titania, manganese, and colloidal alumina. In embodiments, a desired quantity of
one or more promoter(s) is utilized in conjunction with a precipitation hold time to induce a desired
hematite content. In embodiments, the one or more promoter(s) induces hematite after a heat
treatment step. In embodiments a promoter may be added after a specific hold time, for example,
to prevent the formation of hematite beyond a desired level. In embodiments, the precipitation is a
low temperature precipitation, wherein the precipitating temperature is less than or equal to about
20-C, 30-C, 40-C, 50'C, 60'C, or 65'C. In embodiments, the precipitation is a low temperature
precipitation, wherein the precipitating temperature is in the range of from about 20'C to about
65'C. In embodiments, the precipitation is performed 'hot', at less than or equal to about 65'C,
75'C, 85'C, or 95'C, or even with higher temperature (e.g. boiling) solutions. In embodiments,
                                                    10

the precipitation is performed 'hot', at a temperature in the range of from about 65'C to about
95'C. In embodiments, the freshly formed precipitate is heated to higher temperature than the
precipitation temperature.     In embodiments, the method comprises filtration of the precipitation
mother liquor (e.g. salt rich liquids) before reslurrying and aging of the reslurried cake.        The
method may further comprise washing the aged precipitate via contact with a wash solution, to
provide a washed catalyst; promoting the washed catalyst with a chemical promoter; promoting the
washed catalyst with a structural support; spray drying the promoted catalyst; calcining the spray
dried catalyst to provide a calcined hematite-containing Fischer-Tropsch catalyst; or a combination
thereof. These steps will be described in more detail hereinbelow.
10049] Precipitating Precipitate.       The herein disclosed method comprises precipitating a
precipitate by combining an iron nitrate solution with a precipitating agent solution at a
precipitating temperature to form a precipitate comprising iron phases. In embodiments the iron
nitrate solution is co-precipitated (e.g. co-fed at a substantially constant pH) with the precipitating
agent solution. In embodiments the iron nitrate solution is added to the precipitating solution. In
embodiments the precipitating agent solution is added to the iron nitrate solution.        The step of
precipitating may further comprise preparing one or more nitrate solutions containing iron and, in
some embodiments, copper nitrates; preparing precipitating agent; and/or heating one or more of
the solutions prior to precipitating. In embodiments, the ratio of percent Fe2 to percent Fe" is
controlled as described in U.S. Patent App. No. 12/474,440, the disclosure of which is incorporated
herein for all purposes not contrary to this disclosure. Without wishing to be limited by theory, an
increased Fe2+ : Fe      ratio may provide an increased ratio of lepidocrocite (Y-FeOOH) and/or
magnetite (Fe304) relative to goethite (a-FeOOH) and/or ferrihydrite (Fe 5 HOs-4H20) in the
precipitated catalyst.    Upon heating, lepidocrocite and/or magnetite may form maghemite (y
Fe203), while goethite and/or ferrihydrite may form hematite (a-Fe203).        Thus, in embodiments,
the iron nitrate solution comprises Fe(III) nitrate.      In embodiments, the iron nitrate solution
comprises primarily Fe(III) nitrate. In embodiments, the iron nitrate in the iron nitrate solution
comprises substantially all Fe(III) nitrate. In embodiments, the iron nitrate solution also comprises
copper nitrate, and copper phases (e.g. copper oxides) are co-precipitated along with the iron
phases during precipitation.
100501  Copper may be added to the catalyst in any manner known to those of skill in the art. For
example:    (1) copper metal from a suitable source can be added to the iron and dissolved in the
                                                    11

same nitrate solution prior to precipitation; (2) copper nitrate solution can be prepared separately
and added to the iron nitrate solution prior to precipitation; (3) copper nitrate may be added to the
precipitate after precipitation, and prior to spray drying; or (4) copper may be added using any
combination of (1) through (3). In embodiments, copper is added as copper nitrate just prior to
spray drying. The copper nitrate may be added after precipitation and filtration. In embodiments,
the copper nitrate is added with chemical promoter.
[00511   The copper preferably contains no more than 1% impurities. The copper may act as an
activation promoter in the catalyst. The weight ratio of copper to iron may be in the range of from
0.002 to 0.02, from 0.005 to 0.015, or from 0.0075 to 0.01.
[0052]   If there exists significant sedimentation or cloudiness in the nitrate solution(s), the solution
may be filtered to remove solids from the solution prior to combination with the precipitating
solution.
[0053]   Silica is a well known structural stabilizer for precipitated iron catalysts. Without wishing
to be limited by theory, the presence of silica is believed to disperse the active metal sites and
improve the general catalyst surface characteristics (e.g. BET surface area, pore volume, and pore
size), inhibit excessive sintering of the active metal phase, and improve the structural integrity of
the catalyst during the run. In embodiments, the iron nitrate solution also comprises a source of
silica support material, and silica may be co-precipitated along with the iron phases during
precipitation. In embodiments, silica is added subsequent to precipitation, and in embodiments,
later in the preparation, such as prior to spray drying. Silica may be added to the catalyst in any
manner known to those of skill in the art. Inclusion of silica generally provides catalytic systems
that are more difficult to activate and lowers the higher hydrocarbon productivity of the catalyst.
To improve the reducibility and induction of the catalyst, higher levels of copper (e.g. between 1
and 10 weight percent of the total amount of metal present) are typically added.               Similarly,
potassium is also often introduced at higher quantities, typically 1 to 10 weight percent of the total
amount of active metal present, to improve the higher hydrocarbon productivity.
[0054]   In embodiments, the silica comprises a colloidal silica selected from the family of
BINDZIL@ products, the family of LUDOX@ products, TEOS, or a combination thereof.
BINDZIL@ and LUDOX@ grades of colloidal silica are aqueous dispersions that cover an
extensive range of properties including concentration, particle size, particle size distribution,
solution pH, stabilizing ions, and surface treatments.       More specifically, in embodiments, the
                                                    12

colloidal silica (e.g. BINDZIL@ colloidal silica) comprises from about 20 to about 40 weight
percent SiO 2 , or from about 30 to about 40 weight percent SiO 2 ; from about 0.2 to about 0.8 %
Na20, and/or less than about 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, or 0.5 weight percent Na2O; a pH in the range of from
about 8 to about 12; a specific gravity in the range of from about 1.1 to about 1.4, and/or a density
of about 1.2 g/cm 3 ; a surface area in the range of from about 100 m2 /g to about 300 m 2/g, or in the
range of from about 250 m 2/g to about 350 m 2/g; a viscosity of less than or equal to about 12, 11,
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, or 5 centipoise (cP); or some combination thereof. In embodiments, the colloidal
silica (e.g. LUDOX@ colloidal silica) comprises from about 20 to about 40 weight percent SiO 2 , or
from about 30 to about 40 weight percent SiO 2 ; from about 0.01 to about 0.1 weight percent
Na2SO4; a pH in the range of from about 8 to about 12; a specific gravity in the range of from
about 1.1 to about 1.4, and/or a density of about 1.2 g/cm 3; a surface area in the range of from
about 100 m2 /g to about 300 m2 /g, or in the range of from about 250 m2/g to about 350 m 2/g; a
viscosity of less than or equal to about 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, or 5 centipoise (cP); or some
combination thereof.
100551   Precipitating may further comprise preparing precipitating agent (chemical base) solution.
In embodiments, the precipitating agent solution is a 2-10 M aqueous solution. Suitable agents
include, but are not limited to, NH 40H, Na2CO3, NaOH, K 2 C0 3 , KOH, (NH 4 ) 2 CO 3 , (NH 4)HCO 3 ,
NaHCO3 and KHCO 3.           In embodiments, the precipitating agent solution comprises sodium
carbonate.
10056]   The precipitating agent solution (base solution; e.g. ammonium hydroxide) and the iron
nitrate solution may be separately brought to temperatures in the range of ambient to near
boiling. For example, in some instances the temperature is in the range of from about 20'C to
about 95'C (or boiling), or from about 20'C to about 75'C. The temperatures of the nitrate
solution and the precipitating agent solution may be the same or different. In some instances, the
temperature of the precipitating agent solution is about 25'C, for example.
10057]   The catalyst preparation method may comprise heating the iron nitrate solution to a
temperature in the range of about 20'C to 95'C, or from about 20'C to 80'C. In embodiments, the
iron nitrate solution is heated to a temperature in the range of from about 40'C to about 95'C, or
from about 40'C to 80'C. In embodiments, the iron nitrate solution is heated to a temperature of
about 40'C. In embodiments, the iron nitrate solution is heated to a temperature of about 55 0 C. In
embodiments, the temperature of the precipitation mixture is maintained in the range of from about
                                                   13

25'C to about 95'C, or in the range of from about 25'C to about 80'C. In embodiments, the iron
nitrate solution is heated at a rate of temperature increase in the range of from 1 C/min to
20'C/min. In certain embodiments, the iron nitrate solution is heated to about 70'C at a rate of
about 30 C/min. In embodiments, the iron nitrate solution is heated to a temperature in the range
of 60'C to 95'C at a rate of temperature increase in the range of from about 1PC/min to about
20'C/min. In embodiments, the iron nitrate solution is heated to a temperature in the range of
60'C to 80'C at a rate of temperature increase in the range of from about 1C/min to about
20'C/min. In some instances, the solution is heated to a temperature of 70'C at a rate of increase
of about 3 0 C/min. In embodiments, after heating, the resulting iron nitrate solution has a Fe2+:
Fe3+ ratio in the range of about 0.01% : 99.99% to about 100% : 0% (w/w). In embodiments, the
resulting iron nitrate solution has a Fe2+:Fe3+ ratio in the range of about 3% : 97% to about 80% :
20% (w/w). In other embodiments, the resulting iron nitrate solution has a Fe2+:Fe3+ ratio in the
range of about 3% : 97% to about 30%: 7 0% (w/w).
100581  The temperatures of the iron nitrate solution and/or the precipitation agent solution may be
reduced to respective temperatures in the range of 25'C to 35'C, to obtain respective low
temperature solutions, and combined to produce a precipitate comprising iron phases (e.g. Fe2+
and/or Fe 3 hydroxides) and, when co-precipitated with copper, one or more copper phase (e.g.
copper hydroxide) by reacting the low temperature nitrate solution with the low temperature
precipitating agent at a temperature not exceeding 40'C.
10059]  In embodiments, the base solution (precipitating agent solution), at a temperature in the
range of ambient to near boiling, is gradually added to the iron nitrate solution to carefully
precipitate the iron. In some instances the temperature of the iron solution is about 35'C and the
temperature of the base solution is about 25'C, for example. The pH of the mixture after
precipitation may be in the range of from about 6.5 to about 9.0. For example, in some
embodiments, the precipitation pH is about 6.9 - 7.1. The base solution may be added gradually
to the nitrate solution. For example, the base solution may be added to the nitrate solution over a
period of from about 5 to about 180 minutes.           In embodiments, the base solution is added
gradually, for example, over a time of from about 20 to about 120 minutes.             In alternative
embodiments the acid solution is added to the base solution, for example, at the temperatures
delineated hereinabove. In embodiments the acid and base solutions are co-precipitated (e.g. co
fed at a substantially constant pH), for example, at the temperatures delineated hereinabove. In
                                                   14

embodiments the acid is added to the precipitating agent solution within about 10 to 15 minutes,
and in embodiments is added within about 5 to 10 minutes, for example at the temperatures
delineated hereinabove.
10060] Low temperature precipitation may allow for greater control over pH during the
precipitation procedure than possible with catalyst preparation methods in which the
temperatures are close to the boiling points of the nitrates and the base, respectively. The low
temperature precipitation may also allow for improved copper retention, an increase in
crystallinity, an increase in pore size, a decrease in surface area, a decrease in pore volume, a
decrease in crystallite size and/or a combination thereof in the resulting catalyst particles.
10061]   Precipitation Temperature. As noted hereinabove, in embodiments, the temperature of
precipitation or a combination of precipitation temperature and hold time at the precipitation
temperature are varied to induce desired hematite formation, with desired quantities in the range of
from about 0.5 to about 70 weight percent hematite.
10062]   Precipitation Time: As noted hereinabove, in embodiments, the time of precipitation or a
combination of precipitation time and hold time at the precipitation temperature are varied to
induce hematite formation, with desired quantities in the range of from about 0.5 to about 70
weight percent hematite.
10063] Aging/Holding the Precipitate.        As noted hereinabove, it has been unexpectedly
discovered that, in embodiments, aging the precipitate by holding the precipitation mixture (prior
to filtration/washing) at a suitable hold temperature for an adequate hold time allows for a
controlled increase in hematite content of the resulting catalyst that benefits Fischer-Tropsch
catalysis. Without wishing to be limited by theory, it appears that the catalyst particles formed
during precipitation continue to grow and change during the hold time, while maintained in the
liquid from which they precipitated. Without wishing to be limited by theory, it is postulated that
exposure of the freshly formed precipitate to the 'nitrate component' in the slurry may accelerate
the transformation of the freshly formed oxyhydroxide metal to hematite. The changes brought
about by aging may be beneficial in controllably increasing the hematite content from about 0.5 wt.
percent to about 70 wt. percent, and providing average crystalline size of the raw catalyst in the
range of from about 10 nm to about 70 nm, as further described hereinbelow. In embodiments, the
hold time is greater than or equal to about 5, 10, 15, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, or 90
minutes. In embodiments, the hold temperature is a temperature of greater than or equal to about
                                                 15

70-C, 75-C, 80-C, 85'C, 90'C, or 95'C. In embodiments, the hot, freshly precipitated slurry is
cooled under its own dynamic and/or with controlled cooling to control the rate of cooling in an
effort to induce a desired level of hematite in the resulting catalyst. In embodiments a promoter is
added after a specific hold time at a specific temperature to stop the formation of hematite beyond
a specific chosen level.
10064]   Promoting the Precipitate. As mentioned hereinabove, in embodiments, a desired amount
of one or more promoter(s), such as, but not limited to, aluminum, chromium, manganese, silica,
copper, zinc, zirconium and additives, including, but not limited to, amino acid cysteine, and thiols,
including, but not limited to, n-BuSH and iBu-SH, is (are) added prior to or directly following
precipitation to induce the hematite formation. In embodiments, a promoter (or a combination of
promoters) at a desired quantity is utilized in conjunction with a precipitation hold time to induce a
desired hematite content.       In embodiments, promoter and promoter combinations in desired
quantities induce hematite formation after a heat treatment step. In embodiments, for example,
utilization of A12 0 3 promoter quantities in the range of from about 1 to about 30 percent, or even as
low as 2 to 10 percent, results in the formation of hematite. In embodiments a combination of one
or more of the precipitation temperature, the precipitation time, the hold time after precipitation,
and a promoter of choice is/are controlled in order to induce hematite formation, in embodiments
providing hematite in the range of from about 0.5 to about 70 weight percent hematite.
10065]   Filtering and Washing.       In some embodiments, the disclosed hematite-containing FT
catalyst production method further comprises washing the aged precipitate.            The precipitated
mixture comprising iron hydroxides, goethite and/or ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite and/or
magnetite and/or hematite and, in some embodiments, copper hydroxides, may be filtered and
washed to remove residual nitrates. The slurry containing the precipitate may be first pumped
from the precipitation vessel into a holding tank located, for example, upstream of a vacuum
drum filter. The precipitate may be allowed to settle in the holding tank, allowing a clear layer
of nitrate solution to form above the solids. This layer may be drawn off before the slurry is
washed and filtered. A vacuum drum filter fitted with water spray bars may be used for washing
the aged catalyst and concentrating the slurry. To determine when nitrates have been sufficiently
removed, the conductivity of the filtrate may be monitored. The conductivity of the wash water
may be reduced to less than 40 micro mhos or less than 20 micro mhos. It has been determined
that inadequately washed filter cakes demonstrate poor stability with time on-line. Desirably, the
                                                     16

washed filter cake comprises a sodium content of less than or equal to about 0.30 wt. percent,
less than or equal to about 0.20 wt. percent, or less than or equal to about 0.15 wt. percent
sodium in the final catalyst. Alternatively, the pH of the filtrate may be utilized to determine
adequate (e.g. substantially complete) removal of nitrates. As noted hereinabove, it has been
discovered that the delay time between the precipitation step and the filtration step can
significantly impact the quantity of hematite formed and present in the final catalyst.
10066] As noted hereinabove, it has been discovered, that aged precipitates containing hematite
typically wash to (have) reduced sodium contents (e.g. less than about 0.15 weight percent
sodium), while conventional hematite-free materials tend to comprise from about 0.30 to 0.50 wt.
percent sodium. Thus, in embodiments, the inventive method may facilitate precipitate washing
(see Table 1 hereinbelow).

10068] The washed precipitate containing hematite may comprise a higher solids content than
conventional, un-aged precipitates (see Table 1 hereinabove). This higher solids content enables
the spray drying of catalyst particles that are denser and/or exhibit a greater sphericity.          In
embodiments, the solids content of the hematite-containing filter cake is in the range of from about
25 weight percent to about 35 weight percent, depending on hematite content. The solids content
of conventional, hematite-free (or low hematite) filter cakes is typically in the range of from about
19 weight percent to about 21 weight percent. In embodiments, the washed catalyst comprises a
solids content of greater than about 21 weight percent.       In embodiments, the washed catalyst
precipitate comprises a solids content of greater than about 25 weight percent. In embodiments,
the washed catalyst precipitate comprises a solids content in the range of from about 25 weight
percent to about 35 weight percent.
10069]   In some embodiments, washed precipitate is aged. Aging may comprises aging for a
period of time ranging from 5, 10, or 15 minutes to 30 days. In embodiments, aging may comprise
aging for a period of time ranging from 5, 10, or 15 minutes to 240 minutes. In embodiments, the
washed filter cake obtained from the washing is allowed to age, e.g. for a period of time between 5
minutes and 240 minutes.         In embodiments, the washed/filtered catalyst is aged for about 30
minutes.
10070]    Chemically Promoting (Alkalizing).      In embodiments, the catalyst preparation method
comprises re-slurrying the precipitate with and/or adding a chemical promoter. In embodiments,
the chemical promoter comprises potassium.          The chemical promoter may be selected from
potassium compounds including, but not limited to, K2 C0 3 , KHC0 3 , and KOH. The weight ratio
of potassium to iron in the slurry may be such that the calcined catalyst comprises a mass ratio of
from about 1 K20: 100 Fe to about 10 K20:100 Fe, or from about 1 K20: 100 Fe to about 7
K20:100 Fe for examples. In some embodiments, the washed catalyst, comprising the iron and
optionally copper phases, is slurried in a potassium-containing alkaline solution.
10071]   As mentioned hereinabove, all or a portion of the copper desired in the hematite-containing
FT catalyst may be added as copper nitrate at this stage if not or in addition to co-precipitation with
iron phases. In embodiments, copper is added as copper nitrate solution after precipitation and
filtration, but prior to spray drying.
                                                   18

[0072]    Drying and Sizing. The catalyst method may comprise drying the slurry to form a dried
catalyst. In embodiments, the dried catalyst comprises particles having a size distribution of from
about 10 microns to about 100 microns.
[0073]   In embodiments, e.g. within 24 hours of preparing the chemically-promoted catalyst solids
slurry, the promoted slurry is spray dried to form spherical particles. In some embodiments, copper
is added as copper nitrate just prior to spray drying. The spray dried particles may have a size
distribution between 1 and 50 microns in diameter, with an average size of about 30 microns. The
catalyst may have a particulate structure with a particle size distribution in the range of from about
10 pm- 100 gm.
[0074]   In embodiments, less than 10% by weight of the particles are smaller than 45 microns and
less than 10% by weight of the particles are larger than 100 microns.            In embodiments, the
median particle diameter is in the range of from about 60 microns to about 90 microns; in
embodiments the median diameter is in the range of from about 70 microns to about 80 microns;
and in embodiments the median diameter is in the range of from about 45 to about 55
microns. Air classification of the dried catalyst may be used to achieve the desired particle size
distribution. The dried particles may have a moisture content of less than about 20% by weight,
less than about 10% by weight, or less than about 5% by weight. Alternate means may be used
for drying and sizing that will produce like particles. In embodiments, the fine material from
classification is recycled back to the aforementioned promotion step. In embodiments, the fine
material from classification is dry milled and/or wet milled prior to being recycled back to the
aforementioned promotion step. In embodiments, the recycle classification fines have a particle
size up to about 30 microns. In embodiments, the recycle classification fines have a particle size
up to about 20 microns.     In embodiments, the recycle classification fines have a particle size
below 20 microns.
[0075]   As noted hereinabove, the sphericity of the herein disclosed hematite-containing FT
catalyst may be greater than conventional hematite-free catalyst.          In embodiments, a herein
disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst (e.g., 35 ± 5 wt. percent hematite) has a sphericity of
greater than or equal to about 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, or 0.95. Figure IA is a SEM micrograph of spray
dried catalyst particles resulting from a hematite-free slurry, while Figure lB is a SEM
micrograph of spray dried catalyst particles resulting from a hematite-containing slurry. It is
apparent that the particles of Figure lB have greater sphericity than those of Figure IA.

10076]   Calcining.    The herein disclosed catalyst preparation method may further comprise
calcining the spray dried catalyst particles.       The spray dried catalyst may be calcined via any
methods known to those of skill in the art. In embodiments, the dried catalyst particles are calcined
at a temperature in the range of from about 300'C to about 550'C, or from about 300'C to about
420'C, with gradual ramping of the temperature from ambient temperature. In some instances, the
temperature is increased to the calcining temperature at a rate between 0.5 'C/min and 80'C/min.
In embodiments, the ramp rate is between 50 C/min and 50 C/min, or between 10 and 40'C/min.
10077]   Once the desired calcining temperature has been attained, the temperature may be held for
a time period. In embodiments, the catalyst is maintained at the calcination temperature for a dwell
time period in the range of from about 0.5 hour to about 24 hours.           In embodiments, a rotary
calciner is utilized, and the calcination dwell time is from about 0.5 hour to about 1.5 hours. In
certain embodiments, the dwell time is in the range of from about 3 to about 6 hours. In other
embodiments, the dwell time is a time in the range of from about 4 hours to about 5 hours. In
embodiments, the dried catalyst particles are calcined for up to 16 hours. In some embodiments,
the dwell time is about 24 hours.
10078]   In embodiments, calcining comprises: ramping the temperature at a rate in the range of
from about 0. 1C/min to about 80'C/min to a maximum temperature in the range of from about
300'C to about 550'C, or from about 300'C to about 420'C, and holding at the maximum
temperature for at least 4 hours.        In embodiments, calcining comprises a two-step calcination
program wherein the catalyst is heated to a selected maximum temperature twice, with gradual
cooling of the catalyst between the calcinations.
10079]   Without wishing to be limited by theory, it is postulated that calcining removes tightly
bound     water   from the      particles   transforming   goethite  (a-FeOOH)     and/or  ferrihydrite
(Fe5HOs-4H20) into hematite (a-Fe203) and transforming lepidocrocite                (7-FeOOH) and/or
magnetite (Fe304) into maghemite (y-Fe203). Calcining may impart strength to the particles.
100801   In embodiments, a multi-step calcination program is carried out. For example, two passes
may be made in a rotary calciner to simulate rapid heat up in a fluidized bed. The catalyst may
first be calcined at a first calcining temperature (e.g. about 320'C) for a first time period (e.g. 0.5
hours), the temperature ramped from ambient temperature at a first ramp rate of increase (e.g.
about 100 C/min), followed by cooling to room temperature and a second calcining at a second
calcining temperature (e.g. about 320'C) for a second time period (e.g. 8 hours), with a second
                                                     20

ramp rate (e.g. about 0.5 0 C/min). A multi-step calcining program such as this may broaden the
pore diameter of the particles.
100811  Activating the Catalyst. The method of providing hematite-containing FT catalyst may
further comprise activating the calcined catalyst. The activation may be two- or three- phase. As
known to those of skill in the art, activating the calcined catalyst may be effected by exposing the
calcined catalyst to a gas comprising carbon monoxide, hydrogen, or a combination thereof, for a
selected period of time at selected levels of pressure, temperature, and space velocity sufficient to
enhance catalytic activity and stability for hydrogenating carbon monoxide to form higher
hydrocarbons. Any activation method known to those of skill in the art may be utilized.
100821   In embodiments, the activation comprises one or more of the following steps. The reactor
is pressurized at 0 - 350 psig, and the slurry heated under N 2 to 150'C to 200'C at 0.5 0C/min to
5.0 0 C/min.   At this temperature, syngas is introduced over about 5 hours.        The syngas may
comprise a molar ratio of H 2/CO in the range of from about 0.60 to about 2.1, with inert content in
the range of from about 5 mole percent to about 45 mole percent, and a space velocity (SV) in the
range of from about 1.5 Nltot/gcat to about 6.0 Nltot/gcat. With the syngas introduced, the slurry is
heated to the activation temperature of 220-280'C at about 0.10 to about 5.0 0 C/min, whereat the
temperature is held for 1 to 15 hours. After the hold time is completed, the reactor cooled down at
a rate of 0.01 to 1.00C/min to the reaction temperature of 220 to 255'C. Once the reaction
temperature is reached, the syngas, SV and H2/CO molar ratio (if different than the activation
molar ratio of H2/CO) are ramped to the reaction SV and molar H2/CO ratio within a time period of
from about 0.5 to 24 hrs. The pressure is set to the reaction pressure of 300 to 400 psig at 15 psi/h
over a time period of from 1 to 24 hrs. For the evaluations discussed further hereinbelow, the
reactor conditions are set at 220 to 255'C, 300 to 400 psig, 0.60 to 2.1 H 2/CO molar ratio, and 2.0
to 6.0 Nltot/gcat. In embodiments the syngas inert content comprises methane, carbon dioxide,
nitrogen, or a combination thereof in the range of from about 5 to about 45 mol %.
100831   Alternatively the catalyst may be activated in the three phase mode in the reactor slurry
phase in a two step process by reducing the catalyst with hydrogen, followed with syngas
induction. Typically the reactor is pressurized with N 2 at 70 to 210 psig, and then the slurry is
heated in 10 to 100% H 2 from ambient temperature to 250'C at 0.10 to 5.0 'C /min. The slurry is
held at the pretreatment temperature for about 2 to 10 hours. The reactor then cooled down to
about 210'C. At this temperature, syngas is introduced over about 6 hours with a 0.60 to 2.1
                                                  21

H 2/CO molar ratio, inert content, and SV of 1.5 to 6.0 Nltot/gcat. With the syngas introduced, the
slurry is heated to the induction temperature of 220'C to 280'C at 0.11 0 C/min, whereat the
temperature is held for about 1 to 15 hours. After the hold time is completed, the reactor cooled
down at a rate of 0.01 0 C/min to 1.00 C/min to the reaction temperature of 220'C to 255'C. Once
the reaction temperature is reached, the syngas, SV and molar H 2/CO ratio (if different than the
activation molar ratio of H 2/CO) are ramped to the reaction SV and H 2/CO molar ratio within
about 0.5 to 24 hrs. The pressure is then ramped from 0 to 350 psig to the reaction pressure of 300
- 400 psig at about 15 psig / min.
100841  Alternatively the catalyst maybe activated in the two phase mode externally from the
Fischer-Trospch slurry bed reactor in a fixed fluidized bed reactor with hydrogen, followed with
syngas induction in the CSTR. The catalyst is fluidized with N 2 in a fixed fluidized bed reactor at
a superficial velocity (Ug) of about 0.8 to 2.0 cm/s at atmospheric pressure. A constant feed flow
(scfm) to the reactor during the entire testing period is maintained. The catalyst is first dried by
heating the reactor under N 2 to 220'C (20 C/min). When H2 0 formation is less than a target of
about 10 ppm, which is measured by moisture analyzer, the reactor is cooled down to room
temperature. At room temperature, the N 2 is replaced with 4% to 100% H2 in N 2 . The reactor is
then heated to 200'C to 280'C by 0.1 0 C/min to 0.5 0 C/min. The water formation is monitored by
the moisture analyzer in order to control the reduction step. The reactor is held at the reduction
temperature for 2 to 10 hours.      The reactor is then cooled down to room temperature and the
catalyst is transferred to paraffin oil under inert. The syngas induction, which is conducted in the
CSTR, is comparable with what is explained hereinabove.
100851  Producing FT Hydrocarbons. The herein disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst may
be utilized as known in the art to produce FT hydrocarbons.         Thus, also disclosed herein is a
method of producing Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbon product, the method comprising contacting a
synthesis gas stream with the activated form of the herein disclosed catalyst in a Fischer-Tropsch
slurry-bed reactor whereby a Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbon product is obtained. Contacting the
synthesis gas stream with the activated catalyst in the Fischer-Tropsch slurry-bed reactor whereby
the Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbon product is obtained may be carried out at a temperature in the
range of from about 200'C to about 270'C, a pressure in the range of from about 5 bar to about 50
bar, a ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide in the synthesis gas in the range of from about 0.5 to
about 2.5, a space velocity in the range of from about 1 to about 10 NL(H 2+CO)/h/g Fe, or a
                                                   22

combination thereof. In embodiments, the FT synthesis is performed at a synthesis temperature of
about 240'C.
10086] Properties of the Hematite-Containing FT Catalyst. The precipitation time (i.e. the time
it takes to initially contact the acid and the base), the hold time (i.e. the time the catalyst precipitate
is allowed to age in solution before washing and/or filtering), the hold temperature, the
precipitation temperature, or a combination thereof may be manipulated such that the calcined
catalyst comprises a desired weight percentage of hematite, comprises a desired hematite crystallite
size, exhibits a desired reduction temperature, or a combination thereof. In embodiments, the
disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst comprises more than about 0.5, 1.0, 10, 15, 25, 26, 27,
28, 29, 30, 35, or 40 weight percent hematite. In embodiments, the disclosed hematite-containing

crystallite size in the range of from about 1 nm to about 70 nm, or from about 1 nm to about 50 nm.
In embodiments, the disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst comprises an average hematite
crystallite size of greater than or equal to about 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, or 27 nm. In
embodiments, the disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst comprises an average hematite
crystallite size of greater than or equal to about 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, or 27 nm.
100881 The hematite-containing FT catalyst of this disclosure may comprise a weight ratio of
copper to iron in the range of from about 1 Cu : 100 Fe to about 10 Cu : 100 Fe. The hematite
containing FT catalyst of this disclosure may comprise a weight ratio of copper to iron in the range
of from about 1 Cu : 100 Fe to about 5 Cu : 100 Fe. The hematite-containing FT catalyst of this
disclosure may compromise a weight ratio of copper to iron in the range from about 5 Cu : 100 Fe
to 10 Cu : 100 Fe. As mentioned hereinabove, the hematite-containing FT catalyst of this
disclosure may be promoted with potassium. In embodiments, the hematite-containing FT catalyst
of this disclosure comprises a weight ratio of potassium (e.g. as K20) to iron in the range of from
about 1 K20 : 100 Fe to about 10 K20 : 100 Fe. In embodiments, the hematite-containing FT
catalyst of this disclosure comprises a weight ratio of potassium (e.g. as K20) to iron in the range
                                                    23

of from about 1 K20 : 100 Fe to about 7 K20 : 100 Fe. As mentioned hereinabove, the hematite
containing FT catalyst of this disclosure may comprise silica as structural promoter.               In
embodiments, the hematite-containing FT catalyst of this disclosure comprises a weight ratio of
silica to iron in the range of from about 0 SiO 2 : 100 Fe to about 35 SiO 2 : 100 Fe.              In

catalyst comprises from about 1% weight percent to about 70 weight percent hematite.
10089] As discussed further in the Example hereinbelow, the disclosed hematite-containing FT
catalyst may exhibit an unexpectedly low reduction temperature. Without wishing to be limited by
theory it is speculated that the amount and/or crystallite size of hematite in the FT catalyst may be
weakening the interaction between the metal (Fe and/or Cu) and the support (silica) in such a way
that the reducibility of the catalyst is gentler. In embodiments, the reduction temperature is lower
than the FT synthesis temperature. In such an application, the hematite-containing FT catalyst may
potentially be continuously rejuvenated under FT operating conditions during a synthesis run,
providing long term run stability relative to conventional iron-based FT catalysts.         The herein
disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst may exhibit a reduction temperature of less than or equal
to about 250'C, 245'C, 240'C, 235'C, 230'C, 225'C or 220'C. In embodiments, the hematite
containing Fischer-Tropsch catalyst exhibits a TPR of less than or equal to about 245'C, less than
or equal to about 240'C, less than or equal to about 235'C, less than or equal to about 230'C, less
than or equal to about 225'C, less than or equal to about 220'C, less than or equal to about 215'C,
less than or equal to about 210 C, or less than or equal to about 200'C.
[90]9J   The herein disclosed uncalcined hematite-containing FT catalyst may have a BET surface
area in the range of from about 50 m 2/g to about 450 m 2/g, from about 70 m 2/g to about 350 m 2/g,
or from about 100 m 2/g to about 300 m 2/g, or from about 150 m 2/g to about 250 m2/g.
                                                    24

[0091]   The herein disclosed uncalcined hematite-containing FT catalyst may have a mean pore
diameter in the range of from about 25 A to about 120 A, from about 30 A to about 100 A, or from
about 50 A to about 80 A.
[0092]   The herein disclosed uncalcined hematite-containing FT catalyst may have a mean pore
volume in the range of from about 0.2 cc/g to about 0.8 cc/g, from about 0.3 cc/g to about 0.7 cc/g,
or from about 0.4 cc/g to about 0.6 cc/g.
[0093]   Benefits and Advantages.        The herein disclosed method may enable production of
hematite-containing catalyst at a reduced cost relative to conventional FT catalyst production, and
more specifically with respect to the washing process, reducing wash time, water use, or both. The
disclosed catalyst may provide enhanced run time stability. For example, the disclosed catalyst
may provide for a run time stability of greater than or equal to at least 1000 hours, or 2000 hours
with a deactivation rate suitably low to benefit lower catalyst usage through the catalyst
replacement program. Without wishing to be limited by theory, the run time stability may be
enhanced and slower transformation of the active metal phase take place, and hence a reduction in
sintering. Activation of the disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst may provide an active phase
that is beneficial to run time stability. Without wishing to be limited by theory, the active phase
may comprise stable carbides of the Fe3C type, and inhibit the formation of the E-Fe2.2C type that is
associated with catalyst deactivation.    As noted hereinabove, under typical run conditions the
herein disclosed catalyst is resistant to sintering, in embodiments exhibiting surface-average
carbide sizes that increase at rates less than 0.10 nm/hr, 0.05 nm/hr, 0.023 nm/hr, or even lower
rates, and with volume-averaged carbide sizes that increase at rates less than 0.10 nm/hr, 0.05
nm/hr, 0.033 nm/hr, or even lower rates. In embodiments, particle size distributions conform to
log-normal distributions whose center does not increase above 40nm, and more specifically 35 nm,
during 2000 hours of operation. Moreover, following an increased stable run time, the deactivation
rate of the herein disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst may be reduced relative to that of a
conventional, substantially hematite-free FT catalyst. In embodiments, utilization of the herein
disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst provides for FT synthesis with a run time catalyst
replacement rate of less than about 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.80 or 0.50 pound of FT catalyst per barrel of FT
synthesis product.
[0094]   The herein disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst may exhibit enhanced attrition
resistance relative to conventional hematite-free FT catalyst. For example, the herein disclosed
                                                   25

hematite-containing FT catalyst may produce less than about 10, 8, or 5 wt. percent fines (catalyst
particles of 5 pm or less) after 4000 hours of operation.
[00951   Production of FT hydrocarbons via the herein disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst
may provide improved C5+ productivity (and thus profit), such C5+ productivity defined as lbs
C5+ / lb. catalyst / hour. In embodiments, the herein disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst
provides a C5+ productivity of greater than or equal to about 0.14, 0.18, 0.21, 0.23, or 0.30 lbs C5+
product per lb. catalyst per hour. Production of FT hydrocarbons via the herein disclosed hematite
containing FT catalyst may provide reduced carbon dioxide selectivity, such carbon dioxide
selectivity defined as the moles of carbon dioxide produced per moles of carbon monoxide
converted.    In embodiments, the herein disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst provides a
carbon dioxide selectivity of less than or equal to about 29, 24, or 19%.          Production of FT
hydrocarbons via the herein disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst may provide enhanced C5+
selectivity, such C5+ selectivity defined as the moles of C5+ produced per moles of carbon
monoxide converted.       In embodiments, the herein disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst
provides a C5+ selectivity of greater than or equal to about 50, 55, or 60%. Production of FT
hydrocarbons via the herein disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst may provide enhanced CO
conversion, such CO conversion defined as the moles of CO in the product divided by the moles of
CO in the feed. In embodiments, the herein disclosed hematite-containing FT catalyst provides a
CO conversion of greater than or equal to about 50, 55, or 60%.
[0096]   An exemplary FT catalyst according to this disclosure may provide, for example after a
time on stream in the range of from about 1000 to about 1100 hours (e.g., about 1026 hours), a CO
conversion of greater than about 30 percent (e.g., a CO conversion of about 50%), a CO2
selectivity of less than about 30 percent (e.g., a CO2 selectivity of about 20%), a C5+ selectivity of
greater than about 50 percent (e.g., about 60%), and/or a catalyst usage of less than about 0.5 lb.
cat. per barrel of FT product.
                                             EXAMPLES
[0097]   Example 1.     Seven inventive catalysts, ICI, IC2, IC3, IC4, IC5, IC6 and IC7, and one
comparative catalyst, CCl, were prepared as described below.               The hold time following
precipitation was varied, as indicated in Table 2. The catalysts CCl, ICl, IC2, IC3, IC4, IC5, IC6,
and IC7 have the composition: 100 Fe: 5 Cu: 5.7 K20: 32 SiO 2 . The catalyst IC8 (which is a 250
lbs dry basis scaled-up example) has the composition 100 Fe: 5 Cu: 5.0 K 20: 25 SiO 2 .
                                                   26

10098]  This example delineates the steps in the preparation of representative catalysts IC 1-IC7.
The following reagents were employed: commercial iron nitrate solution (Shepherd, 7% Fe);
commercial copper nitrate solution, (Shepherd, 14.9 % Cu); sodium carbonate, Na2CO3 (Alfa
Aesar), ACS reagent grade; nitric acid, 70% (Fisher), certified ACS PLUS grade; and deionized
(DI) water. The catalysts were prepared according to the following procedure:
[099]   (1) Add 1304.0 g of DI water to 1257.14 g ferric nitrate solution. Mix 30.3 g copper
nitrate solution slowly to ferric nitrate solution at ambient temperature with mechanical stirring.
This constitutes 40 g/L Fe, 2 g/L Cu and 29.2 g/L excess HNO 3 . The acid solution is then heated
to as close to 85'C as possible. For catalyst IC8, the nitrate solution was prepared from
commercially available iron powder, as supplied (Hoganas, 98.61% Fe, -325 mesh).                    The
preparation of which is described in U.S. Patents No. 7,879,756; 7,968,611; and 8,138,115.
[001001 (2) A 95 g/L sodium carbonate solution, 264.7 g sodium carbonate plus 2786.4 g DI water,
is prepared and heated to 85'C. For Catalyst IC8, a concentration of 115 g/L sodium carbonate
solution was used.
[oolo1  (3) A quick co-feeding of acid and base solutions is performed at the constant pH of 8.8 (
0.5) and 85'C, while both of the solution temperatures are at 85'C. Desirably, the delay/residence
time between resulting precipitation and washing should be between 5 and 15 minutes.
1001021 (4) The precipitate is held for 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, or 120 minutes at the precipitation
temperature before being removed to a filter device where it is filtered and washed with room
temperature DI water until free of sodium and nitrates.            The filtrate conductivity should be
analyzed down to 40 (± 10) pho.
1001031 (5)   The filter residue is dried sufficiently so that it is easily removed from the filter
material, but not so that it is totally dry. The filtered residue is reslurried to between 10 - 35 wt %
solids content, promoted (chemical and /or structural), and spray dried as soon as possible.
1001041 (6)   In the case of the control sample, CC1, the final washed and promoted filter cake
should ideally contain around 0.5 - 1.0 weight percent hematite, as determined by XRD. In the
case of the inventive samples, IC 1 - IC7, the final washed and promoted filter cake should ideally
contain between 1.0 and 70 weight percent hematite, as determined by XRD.

H Mobile Niro spray dryer, the "feed" was introduced through a nozzle from the bottom with the
drying air cross flowing from the top under the following conditions:      Inlet Temperature: 370'C
(±2); Outlet Temperature: 105'C (±2); Slurry Solids Content: 11 % (±1); Water Setup Flow 4.0 to
4.5 kg/hr (feed flow is set with water, and then switched to actual feed slurry); and Atomizer Air
Flow at 1 bar pressure set between 2 and 6 kg/h, more preferably between 3 and 5 kg/h and most
preferably between 3 and 4 kg/h. The spray dried material was then calcined by heating to 500'C at
0.5 0C/min and holding at that temperature for 4 hours.
100106] Example 2. Two additional inventive catalysts, IC9 and IC 10, were prepared as described
hereinbelow.     The hold time following precipitation was not varied, and kept constant at 15
minutes, as indicated in Table 2. Inventive catalysts, IC9 and IC 10, had the compositions 100 Fe:
24 A120  3 and the composition100 Fe: 15 Mn: 6 Cr: 3 K20: 20 SiO 2 :6 A120  3 respectively.
100107] This example delineates the steps in the preparation of representative catalysts IC9 and
IC10. The following reagents were employed: commercial iron nitrate solution (Shepherd, 7%
Fe); commercial copper nitrate solution, (Shepherd, 14.9 % Cu); sodium carbonate, Na2CO3 (Alfa
Aesar), ACS reagent grade; nitric acid, 70% (Fisher), certified ACS PLUS grade; and deionized
(DI) water. The catalysts were prepared according to the following procedure:
1001081 (1) Add 1304.0 g of DI water to 1257.14 g ferric nitrate solution. Mix 36.28 g colloidal
alumina slowly to ferric nitrate solution at ambient temperature with mechanical stirring. The acid
solution is then heated as close to possible to 85'C.
100109] (2) A 95 g/L sodium carbonate solution, 264.7 g sodium carbonate plus 2786.4 g DI water,
is prepared and heated to 85'C.
1001 10 (3) Other similar preparations included the oxides of chromium, manganese, silica, copper,
zinc, zirconium and combination thereof. In some preparations the oxide is added during step 5
hereinbelow, and in some preparations during the promotion stage of step 8 hereinbelow. In some
instances one or more additives like amino acid cysteine, and thiols like n-BuSH, iBu-SH is added
during the precipitation step.
 oo111 (4) A quick co-feeding of acid and base solutions is performed at the constant pH of 7.0 (
0.5) and 85'C while both of the solution temperatures are at 85'C. Desirably, the delay/residence
time between resulting precipitation and washing is between 5 and 15 minutes.
100112] (5)  The precipitate is held for 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 or 120 minutes at the precipitation
temperature before removed to a filter device where it is filtered, and washed with room
                                                   28

temperature DI water until substantially free of sodium and nitrates.         The filtrate conductivity
should be analyzed down to 40 (± 10) pho.
1001131 (6)   The filter residue is dried sufficiently so that it is easily removed from the filter
material, but not so that it is totally dry. The filtered residue is reslurried to between 10 - 35
weight percent solids content, promoted (chemical and/or structural), and spray dried as soon as
possible.
1001141 (7) The final washed and promoted filter cake contains between 1.0 and 70 weight percent
hematite, as determined by XRD.
1001151 (8)  This mixture was spray dried to spherical particles using a Type H Mobile Niro spray
dryer consisting of a two-fluid nozzle atomizer, drying chamber, air disperser, chamber, product
collection section, air ducts, cyclone, exhaust fan, air heater, and instrument panel. Using the Type
H Mobile Niro spray dryer, the "feed" was introduced through a nozzle from the bottom with the

4.5 kg/hr (feed flow is set with water, and then switched to actual feed slurry); and Atomizer Air
Flow at 1 bar pressure set between 2 and 6 kg/h, more preferably between 3 and 5 kg/h and most
preferably between 3 and 4 kg/h. The spray dried material was then calcined by heating to 5000 C at
0.5 0 C/min and holding at that temperature for 4 hours.
1001161 Example 3. A preparation similar to that of Example 1 and Example 2 is prepared wherein
the precipitation mode is varied to include an acid into base precipitation using 95 ± 5'C solutions.
A solution of about 42 g/L iron copper nitric acid is rapidly, within about 5 to about 15 minutes,
precipitated into a solution of about 90 to about 115 g/L sodium carbonate. Thereafter, the fresh
precipitate is aged for a time in the range of from about 5 and about 120 minutes, to allow for the
development of hematite to between about 1 and about 70 weight percent, and crystallite size of
less than about 10 to about 70 nm crystallite size. Following aging, the precipitate is introduced
into a filter device, whereby it is filtered, and washed with room temperature DI water until
substantially free of sodium and nitrates. The analyzed filtrate conductivity may be less than or
equal to about 40 (± 10) pho upon completion of filtration/washing. Alternatively, promoters, such
as indicated in Example land Example 2, or a combination of hold time and promoters, can be
applied to stimulate a desired hematite formation. The filter residue is dried sufficiently so that it is
easily removed from the filter material, but not so that it is totally dry. The filtered residue is
                                                   29

reslurried to a solids content in the range of from about 10 to about 35 wt % solids, promoted
(chemical and/or structural promotion), and spray dried, desirably as soon as possible following
filtration/washing. The spray dried material was then calcined by heating to 500'C at 0.5 0C/min,
and holding at that temperature for 4 hours.
100117] Discussion of the Results of Examples 1 and 2. As can be seen from studying Table 2,
inventive catalysts IC2, IC3, IC4, and IC5, for which the hold time was at least 30 minutes, exhibit
a greater hematite crystallite size and percent hematite than comparative catalyst CCl and
inventive catalyst IC 1.
[o1oo    The XRD of the catalysts according to Example 1 were determined according to the
analytical methods outlined hereinbelow. Figure 2 is a plot of the XRD patterns for the catalysts
of Example 1. It can be seen that hematite appears with hold times above 30 minutes, growing
increasingly pronounced with hold times of greater than about 45 minutes.
[o101]   Figure 3 is a plot of hematite content (weight percent) and hematite crystallite size (nm) as
a function of hold time for the catalysts of Example 1. As can be seen from studying Figure 3,
hematite content and crystallite size both increase with hold time.
101021   Figure 4 is a plot of first TPR reduction peak ('C) as a function of hematite content
(weight percent) for the catalysts of Example 1. As can be seen from studying Figure 4, the first
TPR reduction temperature decreases with weight percent hematite content.

[0104] Figure 5 is a plot showing the increase in relative physical strength of the catalyst with
increasing hematite content. The catalyst produced in a 2000 lbs catalyst scale up effort at 250 lbs
per batch depicted better attrition resistance than the catalysts prepared in the laboratory. This is
supported by the attrition index data in Table 2.
[01051   High calcined surface area of about 250 m 2/g is maintained with hematite content as high
as 26.4 - 40. 6 weight percent.
[0106]   Very good pore volumes at 0.38 to 0.50 cc/g is maintained with hematite content as high as
26.4 - 40. 6 weight percent.

10107]  Very good pore sizes at 54 to 76 A are maintained with hematite content as high as 26.4
40. 6 weight percent.
101081 It is clear from the performance data in Table 3 that, with hematite content above 20 weight
percent, the hematite-containing catalysts outperform the control catalyst conversion-wise.
Methane and light gas selectivity and C5+ selectivity are slightly better. The hematite-containing
systems produce slightly more C02.
[0109] As illustrated in Figure 6, the relative conversions of IC4, IC5, and IC8 are significantly
higher than that for the control system (CC 1). When the hematite content is beyond the optimum
point (IC6 and IC7), the relative conversion falls below that of the control sample CC1. It is clear
from Figure 7 that a plant activated hematite containing catalyst performs about 1.3 times better
than a baseline system, and demonstrates very good long term run stability.

[0116]  Temperature-Programmed Reaction (TPR).          A 22-27mg sample was weighed out and
placed within the sample tube on top of a quartz frit. The tube was connected to the main
instrument housing of a Micromeritics ChemiSorb 2750 w/ optional ChemiSoft TPx System
using knurled nuts and a compression O-ring. The provided programmable instrument furnace,
capable of reaching 1100"C, was placed around the sample tube. A thermocouple was installed
through the top of the sample port and down into the sample tube using a Teflon ferrule and
oriented so the tip was embedded just slightly in the sample mass. The sample was then
                                                  33

degassed at 110 C under a 50 mL/min flow of nitrogen for one hour and then allowed to cool
under that same atmosphere prior to testing. Once the sample had cooled, the nitrogen gas was
turned off and the testing gas (10% H2 in Argon) was turned on and allowed to flow over the
sample for 10 minutes at 50 mL/min prior to testing. A frozen isopropyl alcohol cold trap was
prepared and placed around the cold trap on the instrument in order to freeze out water generated
during testing prior to the test gas running through the thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
10117]  Metals Content (% Cu and % K).            These protocols have been applied to catalyst
formulations which are basically 98% iron oxides, 1%copper oxides, and 1%potassium oxide.
Other compounds may be present in minimal concentrations as contaminant species.
101181  Digestion Procedure: a) Weigh catalyst sample (100 ± 10 mg) into a 50 mL beaker with
a watch glass cover; b) Add 10 mL of 35% HNO 3 ; c) Bring to a gentle boil for 45 minutes of
refluxing. Maintain volume between 5 mL and 10 mL with de-ionized water; d) Cool on lab
bench for 1-3 minutes.; e) Add 5 mL of concentrated HCl; f) Bring to a gentle boil for 15
minutes of refluxing; g) Cool on lab bench for 1-3 minutes; h) Remove watch glass cover and if
necessary, return to hot plate to reduce volume to about 10 mL; and i) Transfer digestate to 100
mL volumetric flask (Class A) and bring to volume with % HNO 3 . This is called the diluted
digestate.
[0119] Analysis Procedure: a) Prepare calibration standards from certified primary standard;
b) Dilute 1.000 mL of diluted digestate into a 10 mL volumetric flask (Class A) with desired
matrix for element of interest. The dilution matrix used is dependent upon the matrix of the
primary standard. This dilution step can be modified to produce samples with concentrations of
analyte within the range of the calibration standards. Potassium samples require an ionization
suppressant of 0.1 - 0.2 % CsCl or RbCl; c) Analyze calibrations standards and unknowns by
atomic absorption spectrophotometry using a suitable apparatus such as a Shimadzu AA-6501
equipped with a graphite furnace and autosampler.
10120J Crystallite Size. Crystallite Size was calculated using the Full Width Half Maximum
(FWHM) of the XRD peaks and the Scherrer Equation (1918). A highly crystalline hematite
sample (Aldrich, >98%, approximately 5 pm) was scanned and the FWHM of its peaks were
used in the calculations. The crystallite size was calculated for 4 peaks and averaged. The 4

101231  Attrition Test: The Air-Jet Attrition test is used as a method to assess relative attrition of
15 grams of Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. It provides an accelerated simulation of attrition that occurs
inside a Fischer-Tropsch reactor. The equipment consists of a stainless steel attrition tube, where
the catalyst is stressed by high-speed air jets, coming from sub-millimeter nozzles. The airflow is
regulated by a mass flow controller, and humidified with a bubbler. Above the attrition tube is a
glass settling chamber. An assembly for fines collection is placed above the settling chamber. The
percent loss of fines after a specified time of treatment gives a measurement of the attrition
resistance for the catalyst. The weight of the fines generated at 6 time intervals over a 5 hour
period are documented, and the relative attrition index calculated from the increasing fines trend.
