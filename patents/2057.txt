                         BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
        1. Field of the Invention
[0002]      The present invention relates to biopsy devices, and, more particularly, to a
handheld core needle biopsy device.
        2. Description of the Related Art
[0003]       Some practitioners that perform biopsy procedures prefer a self-contained
handheld biopsy device over that of a large console system. A self-contained handheld
biopsy device typically includes a stylet having a pointed distal tip and a side port
proximal to the distal tip configured to receive tissue that will be severed to form a tissue
sample. The stylet may be in the form of a tube (cannula) or rod. A cutter cannula is
positioned coaxial with the stylet to sever the tissue received in the side port of the stylet.
[0004]      One type of self-contained handheld biopsy devices is a partially disposable
biopsy device. A typical partially disposable biopsy device has a reusable handheld driver
to which a disposable probe is releasably attached. The reusable handheld driver is
typically battery powered, and includes electrical motor drives and an onboard vacuum
pump to aid in sample acquisition and/or retrieval. Often, such biopsy devices are
configured for single insertion multiple sample (SIMS) procedures. The disposable probe
is used on a single patient, and then discarded, while the handheld driver is retained for
reuse.

                                              2
[0005]       Some attempts have been made to provide a fully disposable biopsy device,
which is intended to be discarded in its entirety following use. However, such devices
typically have limited capability and/or are not easy to use.
                            SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006]       The present invention provides a fully disposable spring powered core needle
biopsy device. For user procedural flexibility, a full featured core needle biopsy device of
the present invention may include multiple, e.g., two, user selectable firing modes,
multiple, e.g., two, user selectable firing distances, and multiple, e.g., dual, sample
acquisition triggers. The core needle biopsy device further may be provided in a plurality
of different needle gauge size and length combinations. In addition, for ease of use, the
core needle biopsy device may utilize a cocking mechanism that reduces the overall force
required to cock the device. While the Detailed Description of the Invention that follows
is directed to the structural configuration and operation of a core needle biopsy device of

                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0041]       Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to Figs. 1-5, there is
shown a core needle biopsy device 10 configured in accordance with an embodiment of
the present invention. Core needle biopsy device 10 includes an outer housing 12 having a
proximal end 12-1, a distal end 12-2, and a side wall 12-3. Side wall 12-3 defines an
interior chamber 12-4 having a central axis 14. For ease of understanding the invention,
Figs. 1 and 2 show core needle biopsy device 10 with outer housing 12 depicted as being
transparent, while Fig. 3 shows core needle biopsy device 10 with outer housing 12
removed.
[0042]       Extending distally from distal end 12-2 of outer housing 12 is a cutting
cannula 16 and an inner stylet 18. Inner stylet 18 is slidably received within the lumen of
cutting cannula 16, with cutting cannula 16 and inner stylet 18 being coaxial with respect
to an axis 20 (see Fig. 3). Axis 20 is parallel to, and radially offset from, central axis 14.
Cutting cannula 16 is a hollow elongate member that has a distal beveled cutting edge 16
1. Inner stylet 18 is an elongate member that has a sharp penetrating tip 18-1 and a sample
notch 18-2 formed as a side recess proximal to penetrating tip 18-1.

                                               12
[00431       User operational features of core needle biopsy device 10 that are accessible at
the exterior of outer housing 12 include a trigger device 22, a cocking slider 24, and a
selector assembly 26.
[0044]       Trigger device 22 includes a rear trigger 22-1 located at the proximal end 12-1
of outer housing 12 and a side trigger 22-2 located along the side wall 12-3 of outer
housing 12, such as on the distal top side of the device handle. Rear trigger 22- 1 and side
trigger 22-2 are connected via an elongate connector bar 22-3. Providing multiple triggers
helps to accommodate user preference. Some users, such as radiologists and surgeons may
prefer a trigger on the top of the device, such as side trigger 22-2, while others, such as
urologist may prefer a trigger on the rear of the device, such as rear trigger 22-1.
[0045]       Cocking slider 24 is configured to cock the device core needle biopsy device
10 in a two stage process. In a first retraction of cocking slider 24, cutting cannula 16 will
be partially retracted in a proximal direction D1 into interior chamber 12-4 and loaded
under spring pressure to a cocked position. In a second retraction of cocking slider 24,
inner stylet 18 also will be partially retracted in proximal direction D1 into interior
chamber 12-4 and loaded under spring pressure to a cocked position.
[0046]       In the    present  embodiment,      selector assembly     26 is    configured  to
concurrently select between two user selectable firing modes, and to select between two
user selectable firing distances. Selector assembly 26 includes a selector switch 28 having
an exterior tab 28-1 that is accessible to a user at the exterior of outer housing 12. In the
present embodiment, the selectable firing modes are automatic and semi-automatic
(sometimes also referred to as manual). Also, in the present embodiment, the two user
selectable firing distances are 22 millimeters (mm) and 11 millimeters (mm), as measured
from the penetrating tip 18-1 of inner stylet from the cocked position. Exterior tab 28-1 is
used to selectively position selector assembly 26 in one of four selector switch positions,
labeled in Fig. 1 in sequential order in proximal direction D1 from distal end 12-2 of outer
housing 12 toward proximal end 12-1 of outer housing 12: (Position PI) automatic mode,

automatic mode, 11 mm throw; and (Position P4) automatic mode, 11 mm throw.

[00471       In the automatic mode, when the user actuates trigger device 22 (one of
pressing rear trigger 22-1 or sliding side trigger 22-2 in distal direction D2), inner stylet
18 fires forward in distal direction D2 into the patient by the selected distance (e.g., 22
mm or 11 mm) to the desired location, scooping up tissue in sample notch 18-2.
Milliseconds thereafter, cutting cannula 16 is automatically fired forward in distal
direction D2 by the selected distance, with the cutting edge 16-1 cutting tissue and with
cutting cannula 16 covering over a severed tissue sample within sample notch 18-2. The
clinical benefit of firing in automatic mode is a larger sample size compared to firing in a
semi-automatic mode. This is because of a slight downward bend in the sample notch 18
2, which, while in motion acts to scoop up tissue during the forward thrust before the
cutting cannula 16 is fired immediately thereafter.
[0048]       In the semi-automatic (manual) mode, when the user actuates trigger device
22 (one of pressing rear trigger 22-1 or sliding side trigger 22-2 in distal direction D2),
inner stylet 18 fires forward in distal direction D2 into the patient by the selected distance
(e.g., 22 mm or 11 mm) to the desired location. To complete the procedure and fire
cutting cannula 16, the user is required to actuate trigger device 22 (one of rear trigger 22
1 or a side trigger 22-2) a second time. The clinical benefit of firing in the semi-automatic
mode is a more accurate placement of the inner stylet 18, and in turn sample notch 18-2.
By firing only the inner stylet 18 in a first portion of the manual tissue sample collection
sequence, the semi-automatic mode allows the user to then reposition inner stylet 18
within the patient prior to collecting the tissue sample such that sample notch 18-2 is
directly in the tissue region within the patient where the desired tissue sample is to be
taken. When the user is satisfied with the positioning of sample notch 18-2, then the user
will actuate trigger device 22 a second time to fire cutting cannula 16 to collect the tissue
sample in sample notch 18-2.
[0049]       The mechanism by which core needle biopsy device 10 effects the selection
between the two user selectable firing modes, and between the two user selectable firing
distances, is described in further detail below.

                                             14
[0050]      Referring also to Fig. 5, selector assembly 26 includes selector switch 28, a
selector stop 30, and a selector cam 32. Internal to core needle biopsy device 10, selector
assembly 26 is configured to determine a rotational orientation of a sleeve, e.g., a turret,
34, which in turn determines the firing mode and firing distance.
[0051]       Selector switch 28 includes exterior tab 28-1 which projects upwardly from an
arcuate body 28-2. Arcuate body 28-2 includes two cam tracks 28-3 and 28-4. Selector
switch 28 provides the user interface for core needle biopsy device 10 to select the firing
mode and firing distance.
[0052]       Selector stop 30 includes a T-shaped body 30-1 having a proximal end 30-3
that has an upwardly extending pin 30-2 configured to engage and ride in cam track 28-3
of selector switch 28. Selector stop 30 is configured to impede the linear motion of sleeve
34 along central axis 14 in distal direction D2 with respect to the selected firing distance
selected by selector switch 28.
[0053]       Selector cam 32 includes a lateral body 32-1 having a shallow V-shaped cam
surface with a side notch 32-2 at the apex of the cam surface, and having an upwardly
extending pin 32-3. Pin 32-3 is configured to engage and ride in cam track 28-4 of
selector switch 28.
[0054]      Core needle biopsy device 10 further includes a sub-frame 36 formed as a top
sub-frame 36-1 and a bottom sub-frame 36-2. As used herein, the terms "top" and
"bottom" are used merely as relative terms for ease of explaining the invention. Each of
trigger device 22, cocking slider 24 and selector switch 28 is slidably coupled to outer
housing 12 and sub-frame 36 for sliding movement in directions D1 or D2.
[0055]      Referring also to Figs. 6 and 7, slidably received over sub-frame 36 is sleeve
34. Sleeve 34 is configured as a cylindrical body 34-1 that fits over, and is rotatable with
respect to, sub-frame 36. Sleeve 34 has a cantilever arm 34-2 having a downwardly
extending pin 34-3. Pin 34-3 is configured to engage the V-shaped cam surface to in turn
be guided into side notch 32-2 of selector cam 32. Thus, after core needle biopsy device

                                              15
10 is cocked, pin 34-3 of sleeve 34 is positioned in side notch 32-2 of selector cam 32,
and thus the rotational position of sleeve 34 is determined based on the position (PI, P2,
P3, or P4) of selector switch 28 and selector cam 32.
[00561       Referring also to Fig. 8, cylindrical body 34-1 of sleeve 34 has an inner
surface 34-4 from which there extends an inwardly facing sleeve pin 34-5. Sleeve pin 34
5 is located in sleeve 34 at a side opposite to that of cantilever arm 34-2 and pin 34-3. In
Fig. 8, sleeve 34 is shown as transparent to show sleeve pin 34-5 engaging a track 36-3 of
sub-frame 36. In the present embodiment, track 36-3 has three track portions TI, T2, and
T3 that are selectively followed by sleeve pin 34-5. The track portion of track 36-3 of sub
frame 36 that sleeve pin 34-5 of sleeve 34 follows in distal direction D2 during firing is
determined by the rotational position sleeve 34 as determined by the position (PI, P2, P3,
P4) of selector switch 28. Depending on which track portion T1, T2 or T3 that sleeve pin
34-5 of sleeve 34 follows, the sleeve can be toggled into the different firing modes and
firing distances, e.g., automatic firing mode versus semi-automatic firing mode, and a 22
mm firing distance versus a II mm firing distance.
[00571       In particular, track portion TI corresponds to the automatic mode/11 mm
firing distance; track portion T2 corresponds to the semi-automatic mode/ both II mm
and 22 mm firing distances; and track portion T3 corresponds to the automatic mode/22
mm firing distance. Each of the track portions TI and T2 (II mm) is configured such that
at the end of the respective firing stroke, sleeve 34 is positioned via sleeve pin 34-5 at a
common central position T4 corresponding to the terminal end of each of track portions
TI and T2 (11 mm), so as to prepare core needle biopsy device 10 for a subsequent
cocking operation. Similarly, each of the track portions T2 (22 mm) and T3 is configured
such that at the end of the respective firing stroke, sleeve 34 is positioned via sleeve pin
34-5 at a common central position T5 corresponding to the terminal end of each of track
portions T2 (22 mm) and T3, so as to prepare core needle biopsy device 10 for a
subsequent cocking operation.
[0058]       Referring to Figs. 9A-9D, there is shown a depiction of the selector switch 28
in the selector switch positions: Fig. 9 A, (Position PI) automatic mode, 22 mm throw;

                                               16
Fig. 9B, (Position P2) semi-automatic mode, 22 mm throw; Fig. 9C, (Position P3) semi
automatic mode, 11 mm throw; and Fig. 9D, (Position P4) automatic mode, 11 mm throw;
and which show the position of pin 30-2 of selector stop 30 relative to cam track 28-3 of
selector switch 28, and of pin 32-3 of selector cam 32 relative to cam track 28-4 which in
turn is coupled to via pin 34-3 of sleeve 34 via side notch 32-2 of selector cam 32. In the
present embodiment, each of the cam tracks 28-3 and 28-4 has three adjoining track
segments having end points that correspond to a plurality of mode-distance combinations
of the plurality of selector switch positions.
[0059]       Referring to Fig. 10, the longitudinal travel of sleeve 34 is limited by selector
stop 30. In particular, sleeve cantilever arm 34-2 is positioned to abut proximal end 30-3
of selector stop 30, with the position of selector stop 30 being determined by selector
switch 28 based on the selected firing distance, e.g., 22 mm or 11 mm.
[00601       Referring also to Figs. 11-13, the mechanism that effects the cocking of core
needle biopsy device 10 in a two stage process is described in further detail below,
followed by a description of the mechanism that effects firing of core needle biopsy
device 10.
[00611       As used herein, "cocking" of core needle biopsy device 10 is the process by
which each of cutting cannula spring 38 and inner stylet spring 40 are individually
compressed and held in the compressed state (cocked) to store energy that will be released
during a firing operation.
[0062]       In summary, with reference to Figs. 1, 5, and 11-13, with a first user retraction
of cocking slider 24 in proximal direction D1, cutting cannula 16 will be partially
retracted in proximal direction D1 into interior chamber 12-4 and cutting cannula spring
38 is compressed and held. A return spring 42 coupled between cocking slider 24 and sub
frame 36 will return cocking slider to its home (start) position after the user releases
cocking slider 24. With a second user retraction of cocking slider 24, inner stylet 18 also
will be partially retracted in proximal direction D1 into interior chamber 12-4 and inner
stylet spring 40 will be cocked and held.

                                                17
[00631       More particularly, the mechanism by which core needle biopsy device 10
effects cocking of device core needle biopsy device 10 includes cocking slider 24, cutting
cannula spring 38, inner stylet spring 40, return spring 42, cutting cannula slider 44, inner
stylet slider 46, pawl 48, and gear 50. Gear 50 has opposing axel ends 50-1 and 50-2.
Axel end 50-1 is received in a longitudinally oriented slot 36-4 in top sub-frame 36-1, and
axel end 50-2 is received in a longitudinally oriented slot 36-5 in bottom sub-frame 36-2.
Each of top sub-frame 36-1 and bottom sub-frame 36-2 further includes a respective rack
gear 36-6 having teeth which engage the teeth of gear 50. Cocking slider 24 includes a
longitudinal portion 24-1 having a rack gear 24- 2 having teeth which engage the teeth of
gear 50. Each of rack gear 36-6 and rack gear 24-2 are simultaneously engaged with gear
50, thus providing a mechanical advantage that reduces the amount of force necessary to
move cocking slider 24 to cock core needle biopsy device 10.
[0064]       Pawl 48 has a proximal end 48-1, a distal end 48-2, and a mid-portion 48-3.
Distal end 48-2 is configured as a distal hook member, also referenced as 48-2. Gear 50 is
rotatably mounted at axel ends 50-1 and 50-2 to mid-portion 48-3 of pawl 48. Pawl 48
includes one or more leaf springs 48-4 which bias pawl 48 toward cutting cannula slider
44 and inner stylet slider 46 after the user cocks core needle biopsy device 10 the first and
second time, respectively. Pawl 48 is driven by the gear 50 and cocking slider 24, and
pawl 48 directly interacts with cutting cannula slider 44 and inner stylet slider 46,
respectively, to move cutting cannula slider 44 and inner stylet slider 46 to a cocked
position where they are locked in place, as further described below.
[0065]       Cutting cannula slider 44 is fixed to a proximal end of cutting cannula 16.
Cutting cannula slider 44 includes a pair of locking tangs 44-1 formed as elongate
cantilevered arms having respective outwardly facing latch hooks 44-2 having outer
ramped surfaces that diverge in distal direction D2.
[0066]       Inner stylet slider 46 is fixed to a proximal end of inner stylet 18. Inner stylet
slider 46 includes a pair of locking tangs 46-1 formed as elongate cantilevered arms
having respective outwardly facing latch hooks 46-2 having outer ramped surfaces that
diverge in distal direction D2.

                                               18
[00671        Sub-frame 36 is configured to define a distal interior chamber 36-7 and a
proximal interior chamber 36-8, which are divided by a separator wall 36-9, and has an
end wall 36-10.
[00681       Distal interior chamber 36-7 is configured to receive and support cutting
cannula slider 44, with cutting cannula spring 38 being interposed between cutting
cannula slider 44 and separator wall 36-9. Separator wall 36-9 includes a lock opening 36
12 configured to receive outwardly facing latch hooks 44-2 of locking tangs 44-1 of
cutting cannula slider 44 when cutting cannula slider 44 is moved to the cocked position.
[0069]       Proximal interior chamber 36-8 is configured to receive and support inner
stylet slider 46, with inner stylet spring 40 being interposed between inner stylet slider 46
and end wall 36-10. End wall 36-10 includes a lock opening 36-13 configured to receive
the outwardly facing latch hooks 46-2 of locking tangs 46-1 of inner stylet slider 46 when
inner stylet slider 46 is moved to the cocked position.
[00701       During a cocking procedure, distal hook member 48-2 of pawl 48 is biased by
leaf springs 48-4 such that distal hook member 48-2 of pawl 48 is engaged with the distal
end of cutting cannula slider 44. A first movement of cocking slider 24 in proximal
direction D1 causes a rotation of gear 50, and in turn linear displacement of pawl 48
which in turn pulls cutting cannula slider 44 in proximal direction D1 and compresses
cutting cannula spring 38. Once the outwardly facing latch hooks 44-2 of locking tangs
44-1 of cutting cannula slider 44 have passed through lock opening 36- 12 of separator
wall 36-9 the cocking of cutting cannula slider 44, and in turn cutting cannula 16, is
complete and cocking slider 24 may be released to return to its home (start) position by
the biasing effects of return spring 42.
[00711       With cutting cannula slider 44 now in the cocked position, once cocking slider
24 has returned to its distal home position, proximal end 48-1 of pawl 48 is biased by a
third leaf spring (not shown) on the opposite side of pawl 48 from leaf springs 48-4, such
that proximal end 48-1 of pawl 48 is positioned to engage the distal end of inner stylet
slider 46. A second movement of cocking slider 24 in proximal direction D1 causes a

                                                19
rotation of gear 50, and in turn effects linear displacement of pawl 48 which in turn
pushes inner stylet slider 46 in proximal direction D1 and compresses inner stylet spring
40. Once the outwardly facing latch hooks 46-2 of locking tangs 46-1 of inner stylet slider
46 have passed through lock opening 36-13 of end wall 36-10, the cocking of inner stylet
slider 46, and in turn inner stylet 18, is complete and cocking slider 24 may be release to
return to its home (start) position by the biasing effects of return spring 42.
[0072]       Once cocked, the firing mode and firing distance is selected by selector switch
28.
[0073]       Referring again to Fig. 10, the longitudinal travel of sleeve 34 is limited by
selector stop 30, with the position of selector stop 30 being determined by selector switch
28 based on the selected firing distance, e.g., 22 mm or 11 mm. In particular, with the 11
mm firing distance selected, sleeve 34 is rotationally positioned such that sleeve
cantilever arm 34-2 is positioned to abut proximal end 30-3 of selector stop 30 as sleeve
34 is moved in distal direction D2. In addition, the longitudinal travel limit of cutting
cannula slider 44 is also limited by selector stop 30. In particular, cutting cannula slider
44 includes a lower tab 44-3 that is positioned to abut the distal T-shaped portion 30-4 of
selector stop 30. Further, an arcuate slot 34-6 in sleeve 34 is configured to engage a lower
tab 46-3 of inner stylet slider 46, such that sleeve 34 and inner stylet slider 46 will move
longitudinally together, while sleeve 34 is free to rotate about central axis 14 independent
of the rotationally stationary inner stylet slider 46.
[0074]       The mechanism by which core needle biopsy device 10 effects firing is
described below with respect to Figs. 13-17. Figs. 13 and 14 show core needle biopsy
device 10 as being fully cocked and ready for firing, i.e., both the cutting cannula slider
44 and the inner stylet slider 46 are restrained in the cocked position, with the respective
cutting cannula spring 38 and inner stylet spring 40 being compressed.
[00751       Trigger device 22 includes a wedge shaped void 22-4. When fully cocked, and
in either of the automatic mode or semi-automatic mode, actuating trigger device 22
(pressing rear trigger 22-1 in distal direction D2, or sliding side trigger 22-2 in distal

                                               20
direction D2) a first time causes wedge shaped void 22-4 of trigger device 22 to engage
(e.g., squeeze) the outer ramped surfaces of outwardly facing latch hooks 46-2 of locking
tangs 46-1 of inner stylet slider 46 to compress and release locking tangs 46-1 from the
lock opening 36-13 in end wall 36-10, thus permitting the pre- compressed inner stylet
spring 40 to decompress to fire inner stylet slider 46, and in turn inner stylet 18, in distal
direction D2 at a rapid velocity.
[0076]       Trigger device 22 may optionally include a leaf return spring 22-5 positioned
proximal to wedge shaped void 22-4, which may be configured as a pair of diametrically
opposed cantilever arms that are positioned to engage a portion of proximal end 12-1 of
outer housing 12. As such, when trigger device 22 is moved by the user in the distal
direction D2, and then released, trigger device 22 is returned to its proximal (home)
position by the biasing action of leaf return spring 22-5. Alternatively, the optional leaf
return spring 22-5 may be replaced by, or supplemented with, a coil return spring 22-6
(see Fig. 14).
[00771       Referring now to Figs. 5 and 13-15B, located between cutting cannula slider
44 and inner stylet slider 46 is a strike piece 52, which is configured to release the locking
tangs 44-1 on cutting cannula slider 44. The strike piece 52 includes a ramped protrusion
52-1 and a ramped opening 52-2. When cocked as shown in Figs. 13 and 14, ramped
protrusion 52-1 perpendicularly extends through a slide channel opening 36-11 in bottom
sub-frame 36-2.
[0078]       In the automatic mode, when the inner stylet slider 46 is fired the sleeve 34
also moves concurrently in the distal direction D2 along one of track portions TI and T3
(see Fig. 8). When inner stylet slider 46 is near (e.g., within a range of 0 to 2 mm) the end
of its stroke in distal direction D2, sleeve 34 engages and depresses strike piece 52,which
causes strike piece 52 to move inwardly perpendicular to central axis 14 and axis 20
against the biasing force of spring 54. At this time, ramped opening 52-2 of strike piece
52 engages (e.g., squeezes) the outer ramped surfaces of outwardly facing latch hooks 44
2 of locking tangs 44-1 of cutting cannula slider 44 to compress, e.g., radially displace,
and release locking tangs 44-1 from lock opening 36-12 in separator wall 36-9, thus

                                             21
permitting the pre-compressed cutting cannula spring 38 to decompress to fire cutting
cannula slider 44, and in turn cutting cannula 16, in distal direction D2 at a rapid velocity.
[00791      The semi-automatic mode will be described with specific reference to Figs. 5,
15A, 15B and 16. Based on the prior selection of the semi-automatic mode, sleeve 34 has
been rotated to a center position corresponding to track T2 (see Fig. 8) to prevent sleeve
34 from depressing strike piece 52 near or at the end of the firing stroke of inner stylet
slider 46 (see Figs. 15A and 15B). As such, as shown in Figs. 15A and 15 B, cutting
cannula slider 44 remains cocked with cutting cannula spring 38 remaining in the
compressed condition.
[0080]      Thus, in the semi-automatic mode following the firing of the inner stylet slider
46, cutting cannula slider 44 remains cocked with cutting cannula spring 38 remaining in
the compressed condition, awaiting a second actuation of trigger device 22. In general, in
the semi-automatic mode, strike piece 52 is depressed by the second actuation of trigger
device 22, which likewise causes strike piece 52 to move in direction D3 inwardly
perpendicular to central axis 14, and axis 20, at which time ramped opening 52-2 of strike
piece 52 engages the outer ramped surfaces of outwardly facing latch hooks 44-2 of
locking tangs 44-1 of cutting cannula slider 44 to compress, e.g., radially displace, and
release locking tangs 44-1 from lock opening 36-12 in separator wall 36-9, thus
permitting the pre-compressed cutting cannula spring 38 to decompress to fire cutting
cannula slider 44, and in turn cutting cannula 16, in distal direction D2 at a rapid velocity.
[0081]      The semi-automatic trigger mechanism for effecting the firing of cutting
cannula slider and cutting cannula 16 as a result of the second trigger actuation in the
semi-automatic mode will now be described with reference to Figs. 14-17.
[0082]      Sleeve 34, discussed above, further includes a proximally extending cantilever
arm 34-7 having a pair of longitudinally spaced ramped protrusions 34-8, 34-9. Ramped
protrusion 34-8 corresponds to semi-automatic operation at the 11 mm firing distance, and
ramped protrusion 34-9 corresponds to the semi-automatic operation at the 22 mm firing
distance. Referring to Figs. 15A and 15B, when either of the ramped protrusions 34-8, 34-

                                             22
9 is radially displaced in direction D3 toward central axis 14, cantilever arm 34-7 is also
displaced, in a bending motion, in direction D3 toward central axis 14 such that a portion
of cantilever arm 34-7, e.g., an upper portion of ramped protrusion 34-8 or 34-9,
depresses strike piece 52 in direction D3 toward central axis 14, which in turn releases
locking tangs 44-1 from lock opening 36-12 in separator wall 36-9 (see Fig. 5) as
described above, thus permitting the pre- compressed cutting cannula spring 38 to
decompress to fire cutting cannula slider 44, and in turn cutting cannula 16, in distal
direction D2.
[0083]       In order to effect the displacement of cantilever arm 34-7 of sleeve 34 in
direction D3, trigger device 22 includes a proximally extending cantilever arm 22-7
formed as a part of connector bar 22-3. As best shown in the enlarged views of Fig. 15B
and 16, cantilever arm 22-7 has a free end 22-8 that includes a pair of cam follower
members 22-9, each having a front cam follower surface 22-10 and a rear cam follower
surface 22-11.
[0084]       Referring to Figs. 15B and 16, outer housing 12 includes a pair of cam rails
12-5 formed as a pair of opposed rails that are angled inwardly toward central axis 14 in
the distal direction D2. In the present embodiment, cam rails 12-5 are orientated at an
angle in a range of about 40 degrees to 50 degrees with respect to the orientation of
central axis 14. Each of cam rails 12-5 includes a front cam surface 12-6 and a rear cam
surface 12-7.
[0085]       When trigger device 22 is moved in distal direction D2, front cam follower
surface 22-10 of cam follower members 22-9 of cantilever arm 22-7 will engage rear cam
surface 12-7 of cam rails 12-5, and in turn free end 22-8 of cantilever arm 22-7 is
displaced in direction D3 toward central axis 14. In the embodiment shown, the free end
22-8 of cantilever arm 22-7 thus engages ramped protrusion 34-9, which in turn is radially
displaced in direction D3 toward central axis 14, thereby the free end 34-10 of cantilever
arm 34-7 is also displaced, in a bending motion, in direction D3 toward central axis 14 to
displace, e.g., depress, strike piece 52 in direction D3 toward central axis 14, which in

                                               23
turn releases locking tangs 44-1 from lock opening 36-12 in separator wall 36-9, thus
firing the cutting cannula slider 44, and in turn cutting cannula 16, in distal direction D2.
[0086]       As front cam follower surface 22-10 of cam follower members 22-9 of
cantilever arm 22-7 clears the distal extent of rear cam surface 12-7 of cam rails 12-5,
cantilever arm 22-7 will spring back to is steady state position, thus positioning rear cam
follower surface 22-11 of cam follower members 22-9 of cantilever arm 22-7 in
longitudinal alignment with front cam surface 12-6 of cam rails 12-5. Also, at this time
cantilever arm 34-7 will spring back to its steady state position, and spring 54 will return
strike piece 52 to its steady state position.
[00871       When trigger device 22 is released, coil return spring 22-6 moves trigger
device in proximal direction D1 toward its home position. During the travel of trigger
device 22 in proximal direction D1 to its home position, rear cam follower surface 22-11
of cam follower members 22-9 of cantilever arm 22-7 engages front cam surface 12-6 of
cam rails 12-5, which in turn guides the cam follower members 22-9 proximally up the
front cam surface 12-6 of cam rails 12-5, thereby displacing free end 22-8 of cantilever
arm 22-7 in direction D4 away from central axis 14 until rear cam follower surface 22-11
of cam follower members 22-9 of cantilever arm 22-7 clears the proximal extent of front
cam surface 12-6 of cam rails 12-5, at which time cantilever arm 22-7 will spring back to
is steady state position, with trigger device 22 now reaching its home position, as
illustrated in Fig. 17.
[0088]       A general description of the overall operation of core needle biopsy device 10
now follows with further reference to Fig. 18.
[0089]       At step SI 00, the user cocks the core needle biopsy device 10 in a two stage
process by pulling cocking slider 24 proximally in proximal direction D1. The first
retraction of cocking slider 24 locks cutting cannula slider 44 in place through a linear
movement of pawl 48 in proximal direction D1 and compresses cutting cannula spring 38.
Cocking slider 24 is returned to its starting position via return spring 42. Pawl 48 is then
biased by the third leaf spring, opposite to leaf springs 48-4, to contact inner stylet slider

                                               24
46. The user then retracts the cocking slider 24 a second time in proximal direction Dl to
lock inner stylet slider 46 in place and compressed inner stylet spring 40. Core needle
biopsy device 10 is now cocked and ready for use (see Figs. 13 and 14).
[0090]       At step SI 02, referring to Figs. 6 and 9A-9D, the user concurrently selects the
firing mode and distance by positioning the selector switch 28. Moving selector switch 28
causes the selector cam 32 to position sleeve 34 to select the desired firing mode, e.g.,
automatic or semi-automatic, and the desired firing distance, e.g., in the present
embodiment 11 mm or 22 mm.
[0091]       At step SI 04, the user fires core biopsy needle device 10 by actuating either
rear trigger 22-1 or side trigger 22-2 of trigger device 22, thereby moving trigger device
22 in distal direction D2.
[0092]       When the trigger device 22 is actuated in the automatic mode, inner stylet
slider 46 and the attached inner stylet 18 travel forward at a rapid velocity (fire) in distal
direction D2 by the decompression of inner stylet spring 40. Simultaneously, sleeve 34,
following the track 36-3 (TI for 11 mm, or T3 for 22 mm; see Fig. 8) in sub-frame 36,
travels forward depressing the ramped protrusion 52-1 on strike piece 52 which
subsequently squeezes the locking tangs 44-1 on cutting cannula slider 44 causing cutting
cannula slider 44 and the attached cutting cannula 16 to also travel forward at a rapid
velocity (fire) in distal direction D2 by the decompression of cutting cannula spring 38.
[0093]       When the trigger device 22 is actuated a first time in the semi-automatic
mode, inner stylet slider 46 and the attached inner stylet 18 travel forward at a rapid
velocity (fire) in distal direction D2 by the decompression of inner stylet spring 40.
Simultaneously, sleeve 34 following track 36-3 (T2 for both 11 mm and 22 mm; see Fig.
8) in sub-frame 36, travels longitudinally but is rotationally positioned such that sleeve 34
does not depress strike piece 52. When trigger device 22 is actuated a second time, the
ramped protrusion 52-1 on strike piece 52 is depressed, which in turn squeezes, e.g.,
radially displaces, the locking tangs 44-1 on cutting cannula slider 44 in a direction
perpendicular to central axis 14 to cause cutting cannula slider 44 and the attached cutting

                                            25
cannula 16 to also travel forward at a rapid velocity (fire) in distal direction D2 by the
decompression of cutting cannula spring 38.
