                                                        Modular assay system
This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2014206681, the
entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
The present invention relates to a modular assay system.
In remote areas or even point of care analysis of biological samples is difficult for a
number of reasons. Most often, the assay devices required for processing complex
assays or processing high volumes of samples are so large that it is not possible to
provide the device in the area in which the sample is obtained from a patient and as
such the service cannot be provided in a timely manner. Samples must be sent to
laboratories having the space and access to large assay devices.
It would be beneficial to have a robust assay device that can be portable and provide
point of care assaying of biological samples and which has the versatility to be up
scaled for high through put biological assaying.
In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a system
for conducting an assay comprising a power source, a controller for controlling the
assay and a plurality of assay units operatively connected to one another such that
the controller can communicate with the assay units and the system is capable of
conducting the assay.
In one embodiment each assay unit has means for operatively connecting to another
unit.
                                                                 - 1-

WO 2014/111719                                                        PCT/GB2014/050124
     In another embodiment the means for operatively connecting to another
     unit comprises one member of a mating pair. In another embodiment the
      mating pair comprises a plug and socket. The mating pair may allow for
      vertical connection between adjacent units.
      In another embodiment a plurality of assay units arranged in towers, with
      adjacent units mounted one on top of another.
       A plurality of towers may be operatively connected to one another.
       In another embodiment the system may comprise a controller in the form
       of a control unit.
        In another embodiment each assay unit comprises locating means for
        locating said unit in a docked configuration with another assay unit. The
         locating means may comprise a first member on a first unit and a second
         member on a second unit.
         The first and second members may each comprise one of the following: a
          locating arm or a stop lug.
          In another embodiment the first member comprises a locating arm and the
           second member comprises a stop lug. Each assay unit may comprise both
           a locating arm and a stop lug such that it is able to connect to two other
           discrete units.

WO 2014/111719                                                         PCT/GB2014/050124
     In another embodiment each unit comprises a plurality of first and second
     locating members.
      in another embodiment the system may comprise securing means for
      securing units together. The securing means may comprise a first member
       disposed on a first unit and a second member disposed on a second unit.
       The first member of the securing means may comprise a tab and the
       second member may comprise a complementarily shaped recess. The
       securing means may additionally comprise a threaded fastener which
       passes through an aperture in the tab and complementarily shaped
        recess.
         in another embodiment, located within each assay unit is heating means
         for subjecting a sample and/or reagents to localised heat. Localised heat
          is achieved by means of induction and/or resistive heating means.
          Preferably, localised heat is by means of induction with said means
           located within the assay unit.
           The application of heat can be applied at various sites on the assay
            device. This can be achieved through control of the rotation of the assay
            device within each unit such that different regions of the assay device can
            be presented to the heating means as desired and as required by the
             particular assay being conducted.
                                                    3

     The system may comprise more than one heating means.
     The heating means may comprise a wireless induction heating system or
     heat transfer using resistive heating foil
      The assay device may comprise one or more areas or features comprising
      a metal. The metal may be any one or more of nickel, iron or copper.
      Preferably, the metal used is nickel. The metal may comprise the induction
       heating element.
       The heating means may comprise means for applying an alternating
       magnetic field using an electromagnetthrough which a high-frequency
       alternating current (AC) is passed.
        Each assay unit may comprise an optical detector for use in an assay. The
        optical detector may be capable of determining colour and sending
        appropriate signals to a controller.
         The system may comprise means for determining temperature. Preferably,
         the means is capable of determining the temperature of a localised area
         within the system. More preferably, the means is capable of determining
          the temperature of a localised area on the assay device.
           The means for determining temperature may comprise a thermochromic
           coating. The thermochromic coating may be applied in one or more
                                                4

WO 2014/111719                                                         PCT/GB2014/050124
     discrete sections of the assay device. The coating may be in the form of a
     patch applied to the assay device.
     The thermochromic coating may determine that the temperature within a
     specified area has reached the desired temperature (the coating will
      change colour within a defined temperature range). This can be detected
      by the system and a signal sent to the controller. The controller may then
      switch off the heating element. The heating element may be selectively
       switched on/off as directed by central control unit (identified by colour
       alteration in the thermochromic patch).
        The thermochromic patch could also be used to locate/position the assay
        device in the correct orientation within the system.
        The thermochromic coating may comprise any one or more of a
         thermochromic paint, dye paper or liquid crystals.
         For controlling processes such as an assay on a disk, there are several
          known possibilities to stop or let liquids pass again at controlled points and
          at controlled times. One example is generating a local hydrophobization,
          as described in M. Madou et al., "Lab on a CD", Annual Review of
           Biomedical Engineering, Vol. 8, p. 601-628, 2006, C.T. Schembri et al.,

     by an adverse centrifugal field. If the rotational frequency drops below a
     certain threshold, the siphon is filled capillarily, and the leading meniscus
      may sink radially outside the liquid level in the upstream reservoir. A
      higher rotational speed then subsequently conveys the liquid further.
      Apart from the basically reusable valves mentioned, there also exist so
      called sacrificial valves, which cannot be used again after a single
       actuation. One example of such valves is barriers of wax or thin foils in
       the flow channel, which are melted by a laser and thus allow for the flow

        whole blood on a centrifugal microfluidic device", Lab on a Chip, Vol. 7,

         In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, there is
         provided an assay device comprising a substantially circular body having a
         plurality of chambers in fluid connection such that fluid can pass between
          said chambers and a central hub having a sample inlet disposed therein
          for receiving a sample.
           In one embodiment, the assay device has a substantially planar circular
           body.
            In a further embodiment the assay device comprises a unique serial
            identifier,
                                                   6

WO 2014/111719                                                          PCT/GB2014/050124
     A unique identifier for each assay device can identify the type of test or
     ensure that the device is not used beyond its expiry date. More
     importantly, the unique serial identifier may enable each sample
      introduced to the assay device could be uniquely identified to prevent the
      risk of a mismatched result and/or the sample.
       In order to achieve this, this unique identifier may be coded and attached
      to the assay device.
        In a further embodiment the unique identifier comprises a 1D colour
        barcode, 2D barcode or an RFID tag.
         Such systems as Microsoft's High Capacity Colour Barcode (HCCB)
         technology may be used.
         The unique serial identifier may be physically attached to or incorporated
          in the assay device. The disadvantage with using a simple linear ID
          barcode is that the length of the label becomes prohibitive. Other methods,
           such as a 2D barcode or an RFID tag, can be used. A 2D barcode label
           becomes advantageous for the higher amount of data could be stored in a
           0.75"x 0.75"square region. A 2D barcode could be detected by a 2D
            barcode scanner which uses the imaging technology. There
            is a minimum reading distance required to read the 2D barcode due to the
            optical path. In order to reduce the optical patch, additional mirror and
            optical components are required.
                                                   7

WO 2014/111719                                                       PCT/GB2014/050124
     RFID could be an option for its compactness and able to store a
      reasonable amount information. It has one major advantage over the 1 D
      or 2D barcode system where the content could be modified to store
      additional information if required. However, the cost of a RFID increases
      the consumable overhead cost for the small size
       RFID without occupied the space on the disc.
       To overcome the limitation of the length of ID barcode, a cost efficient
       way of achieving the same level of coding system is to utilise the same
       optical detector for detecting the fluorescence output to detect multiple
        colour patches which may be a dot or line.
        Essentially colour patches are marked or printed along the circumference
         of the assay device. When the disc rotates each colour patch is scanned
         sequentially through the optical sensor to form a linear stream of data.
         When the assay device is rotated, each colour patch may be scanned by
         the optical sensor forming a linear radial colour barcode. With the multiple
         colour patches, a higher density of data is achieved.

          colour code with the ideal values of RGB measured by the optical sensor:

Table 1 shows the ideal RGB values required to be measured by the optical sensor. In
real application, the colours should be carefully chosen such that minimum colour
discrimination of 128 could be achieved. For example, if R, G and B on the table above
are used, the minimum colour discrimination for each colour is 256.
A typical reading signal from an option sensor is illustrated in Figures 9a and 9b.
In one embodiment, the code is as follows:
                           Readable Characters           Number of Characters
                           0-9                                    10

Table 2 shows the 94 readable characters that can be encoded with colour codes:
In one embodiment, using 3 types of colour patches (R, G, B) a combination of 4 patches
is required to represent the 94 readable characters while 3 patches are required for each
readable character.
For example, a string of 20 characters would require 4 x 20 (80) patches using 3 colour
types patches while 3 x 20 (60) patches by using 8 colour types patches.

In order to further improve the data density, each character could be converted into
binary and then encodes using the table below:
            Binary             Code              Colour
               000                 R                Red

                111                W               White
For example, the string "ABCD241212CODELOT###" when converted into binary is
"10000011000010100001110001001100101101001100011100101100011100101000011

By encoding using 3 binary digits, the encoded string becomes :
  "BRWRORCBGCYCGCRPYCRPYGRPYPBGGYCYBBPWOYRPRPRWR"
  which reduces the number of colour patches to 45. An example of which is illustrated in
   Figure 10.

A number of means for formatting the colour patches are envisaged. Two such methods
of formatting the colour patches are described below:
i. Continuous
ii. Alternate with a blank patch.
In Continuous mode, the colour patches are arranged such that the colours are very
closed to each other to such that a continuous optical signal is measured by the optical
sensor. The advantage of this format is the length of the codes is significantly reduced.
However, size of the patch needs to be selected such that it is at least double the size of
the minimum rotational angle of the stepper motor. This is to prevent any patches are
missed out during reading. In this mode, each patches needs to be positioned on top of
the optical sensor and stepped through sequentially. This could make the system to lose
the accuracy of the reading if the

     patch does not align to the sensor. To improve this, the second method is
      introduced.
       In second mode, a blank patch is inserted in between two colour patches.
       This blank patch (black) when read by the optical sensor produced a low
       signal. This acts as the sampling notch indicating a valid data is located in
        between the two sampling notch. This method will improve the accuracy of
        reading as we know the position of valid data. However, the length of code

           The instrument may use a recipe system that could be used to reprogram
           the device to perform a test. The recipe contains the information about the
            set of parameters
            and conditions that are used to configure the system to run a particular
                                                 15

     test. Usually this recipe information could be printed in a sheet of paper in
      barcode and the information is scanned and stored in the instrument as a
      new recipe or replacing the existing recipe. This method reduces the
      hassle of setting the parameters for the new disc, more intuitive as the
      user needs only very basic instruction to utilise the system. This prevents
      transcription errors that could ruin the testing if the settings do not
       programme correctly.
       On the other hand, if this recipe information could be put on the disc, the
       instrument could automatically download the recipe from the disc and the
        new type of disc could be used instantaneously further reducing the step
        required to setting up the new discs. If the recipe needs updating, it could
        automatically replace
         the old recipe and prevents a user from using the old testing parameters
         accidentally.
          In one embodiment, the colour coding itself may contain a low level of
          security where it is tailored made to the response of the optical detection
           unit and the colour code patterns are fairly hard to recognise. However,
           without any encryption, there is a chance that the content could be
           extracted. The recipe information is the key for the instrument to operate.
           We do not want user to mess around with the settings that potentially
           invalidate the test results. The encryption could be performed easily in this
            colour coding system. The most straight forward method is to scramble the
                                                  16

     mapping of the colour code with the binary data using a key. This key will
     be used for the decryption process.
      In one embodiment, the barcode is printed using UV sensitive ink such
      that the barcode is not visible to the human eye but can be read using
      suitable detection devices.
       Each assay unit may comprise an optical detector for use in an assay. In
       one embodiment, the same optical detector may be used to read the
       barcode and, for example, to subsequently detect the fluorescence output
       from the assay.

      reading the screen in bright light conditions. In an alternative embodiment,
      the screen can be pivotally mounted on the control unit such that it can be
      moved about it's pivot for ease of operation, for example, to avoid
       reflection issues in bright sunlight. Located in an open drawer 20 of the
       bottom assay unit 14 is an assay device 22 having a disc body 24 and a
        central hub 200. The assay device is received by a motor shaft which is
        capable of rotating the assay device according to signals sent by the
        controller of the control unit.
         The battery unit 16 comprises one DC connector 74 (12V DC in) and two
         "signal" sockets, 9-way D-type, 70,72, for example. A higher voltage can
         be used, typically 12 - 50 V.
          Each unit is substantially rectangular, having a front 80 and rear 82 wall
          and two side walls 84,86.
          Disposed on each side wall is a pair of locating arms 88,90 and two stop
           lugs 92,94. The locating arms 88,90 are disposed on the upper edge of
           each side wall and the stop lugs 92,94 are located on the lower edge of
           each sidewall and extend perpendicularly with respect to the plane of each
            sidewall such that the stop lugs do not extend beyond the bottom edge of
            each side wall. In contrast the locating arms extend above the upper edge
            of each side wall. The locating arms have a substantially L-shape, one end
                                                   19

     being integrally formed with the sidewall whilst the free end extend in a
     direction parallel to that of the upper edge of the side wall.
      Located on the upper edge of the rear wall of each unit are two securing
      tabs 100, 102. Disposed on the lower edge of rear wall 82 are two
       recesses 104,106 complementarily shaped with respect to tabs 100,102.
       Securing tabs 100,102 are received by recesses 104,106 of an adjacent
       unit when located. The tabs and recesses each have an aperture 108
        which, when aligned form a through going bore through which a fastener
        can pass securing adjacent units in a docked position.
        To operatively connect adjacent assay units, a horizontal mating plug 110
         and socket 112 is employed. Each unit has a socket to mate with a second
         unit and a plug to mate with a third unit. Typically, the plug is arranged to
         engage and mate with a unit disposed below the unit whilst the socket is
         arranged to engage and mate with a unit disposed above the unit in
          question.
          To assemble a tower one unit is docked with another.
           A second unit is docked with a second unit by sliding the second unit (see
           Figs. 4a and b) into position on top of the first unit. In so doing, plug 1112
           can mate with socket 110. Locating arms 88,90 can engage with stop lugs
                                                  20

     92,94 and securing tabs 100,102 can be received by recesses 104,106.
     To firmly secure the units in the docked configuration two fasteners
     (screws) can be used to secure the units.
      Each unit is operatively connected via plug 110 and socket 112 to the
      other such that they can communicate with and through each other.
      The front wall 80 of each assay unit has an opening 120 for receiving a
       drawer 20 which itself is arranged to receive an assay device 24. The
       assay device is a substantially planar disc in shape having a central hub
       around which is disposed assay chambers capable of containing reagents,
       connected to one another by capillaries.
        Each drawer can be selectively opened and closed as necessary. The
        main control unit Is capable of sending a command to any one or more
        assay units in the system to selectively open or close the drawer, or
        indicate which assay unit or units are to be used, as required. When an
         assay is to be carried out, an assay device 24 is loaded with a sample and
         placed in the assay drawer in its open configuration. The control unit is
         then used to initiate the assay programme and the drawer moves to its
          closed configuration, thus moving the disc within the assay unit to conduct
          the assay in accordance with the programmed instructions stored in the
           control unit,

     All interconnections within a tower between units are made automatically
     when a new unit is slid into position. The signals between each drive bay
      and the main control unit on the top of the first tower can all connect to a
      parallel "bus" so, by fitting two sockets to the rear of the battery unit, users
      can connect one or more additional towers (without control units) in the
      most convenient way. For example, two additional towers positioned
       either side of the "control" tower can each be connected to the closest
       socket on the battery unit. It does not matter which socket is used on the
       additional units. If the additional units are both placed on the same side of
       the control unit, one cable can connect from a socket on the battery unit to
       a socket on the first additional unit and a second cable can be plugged
        into its second socket and routed to the second additional unit. A third
        tower could be connected, in a similar manner, to the second tower.
         The connections from this signal bus and the dc supply connections will be
         fed to the assay units using Flexible Printed Circuit strips and appropriate
         connectors (not shown).
          Fig. 5 shows a lid 130 which is used as the top section of a tower that
          does not have a control unit. The lid seals the unit below from the
          surrounding environment. Each lid comprises two stop lugs 132,134 on
          each side wall and two securing recesses 136,138 which engage with the
           locating arms and securing tabs respectively of the unit below.

     The control unit fits to the top drive bay in the same manner as other drive
     bays but does not require a lid. To simplify internal wiring, any additional
      ports, e.g. USB or Network will be mounted on the Control Unit.
      In an alternative embodiment, the control unit has a screen in a fixed
      position which is ergonomically disposed with respect to a user during use.
       Fig. 7 shows a plurality of towers 21 connected to a main control unit
       tower 12. Each of the towers 21 are connected to the control unit tower
       either directly or via towers 12 linked in series via cabling 190.
        Fig. 8 shows a central hub 200 of an assay device in accordance with an
        embodiment of the present invention. The hub is centrally mounted on a
        disc shaped assay device (not shown). Located near to its circumference
        is a sample inlet 202 and adjacent to that is a nipple 204. Inlet 202
         comprises a through going bore 206 having a side wall 20B. The sample
         inlet 202 is in a first configuration aligned with and in fluid communication
         with a sample Inlet (not shown) located on the disc portion of the assay
          device such that fluid can flow from the inlet 202 into the disc portion of the
          assay device. Once a sample has been introduced, the central hub 200
          can be rotated relative to the disc and its inlet. In so doing, the nipple or
          closure means, is rotated into alignment with the inlet of the disc thus
          sealing the sample within the disc from the surrounding environment and
           preventing contamination of the sample and assay reagents.
