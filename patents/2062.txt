                            Abstract
     A variable flow resistance system for use with a
subterranean well can include a structure which displaces in
response to a flow of a fluid composition, whereby a resistance
to the flow of the fluid composition changes in response to a
change in a ratio of desired to undesired fluid in the fluid
composition. Another system can include a structure which
rotates in response to flow of a fluid composition, and a fluid
switch which deflects the fluid composition relative to at
least two flow paths. A method of variably resisting flow in a
subterranean well can include a structure displacing in
response to a flow of a fluid composition, and a resistance to
the flow of the fluid composition changing in response to a
ratio of desired to undesired fluid in the fluid composition
changing. Swellable materials and airfoils may be used in
variable flow resistance systems.

   Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, which is a

                           TECHNICAL FIELD
        This disclosure relates generally to equipment utilized
   and operations performed in conjunction with a subterranean
   well and, in an example described herein, more particularly
20 provides for variably resisting flow.
                              BACKGROUND
        Among the many reasons for variably resisting flow are
   included: a) control of produced fluids, b) control over the
25 origin of produced fluids, c) prevention of formation damage,
   d) conformance, e) control of injected fluids, f) control over
   which zones receive injected fluids, g) prevention of gas or
   water coning, h) stimulation, etc.  Therefore, it will be
   appreciated that improvements in the art are continually
30 needed.

                                   - 2
                                 SUMMARY
           In this disclosure, systems and methods are provided
     which bring improvements to the art of variably resisting
     flow of fluids in conjunction with well operations. One
  5  example is described below in which a change in direction of
     flow of fluids through a variable flow resistance system
     changes a resistance to the flow. Another example is
    described below in which a change in a structure changes the
     flow resistance of the system.
 10       In one described example, a variable flow resistance
    system can include a structure which displaces in response
    to a flow of a fluid composition. A resistance to the flow
    of the fluid composition changes in response to a change in
    a ratio of desired to undesired fluid in the fluid
15  composition.
          In another example, a variable flow resistance system
    can include a structure which rotates in response to flow of
    a fluid composition, and a fluid switch which deflects the
    fluid composition relative to at least two flow paths. In
20  this example also, a resistance to the flow of the fluid
    composition through the system changes in response to a
    change in a ratio of desired to undesired fluid in the fluid
    composition.
          In a further example, a variable flow resistance system
25  can include a chamber through which a fluid composition
    flows, whereby a resistance to a flow of the fluid
    composition through the chamber varies in response to a
    change in a direction of the flow through the chamber, and a
    material which swells in response to a decrease in a ratio
30  of desired to undesired fluid in the fluid composition.
          In yet another example, a variable flow resistance
    system can include at least two flow paths, whereby a

                               - 3
   resistance to a flow of a fluid composition through the
   system changes in response to a change in a proportion of
   the fluid composition which flows through the flow paths. In
   this example, an airfoil changes a deflection of the flow of
 5 the fluid composition relative to the flow paths in response
   to a change in a ratio of desired to undesired fluid in the
   fluid composition.
        A further example comprises a method of variably
   resisting flow in a subterranean well. The method can
10 include a structure displacing in response to a flow of a
   fluid composition, and a resistance to the flow of the fluid
   composition changing in response to a change in a ratio of
   desired to undesired fluid in the fluid composition.
        These and other features, advantages and benefits will
15 become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art upon
   careful consideration of the detailed description of
   representative embodiments of the disclosure hereinbelow and
   the accompanying drawings, in which similar elements are
   indicated in the various figures using the same reference

                          DETAILED DESCRIPTION
          Representatively illustrated in FIG. 1 is a system 10
    for use with a well, which system can embody principles of
15  this disclosure. As depicted in FIG. 1, a wellbore 12 has a
    generally vertical uncased section 14 extending downwardly
    from casing 16, as well as a generally horizontal uncased
    section 18 extending through an earth formation 20.
          A tubular string 22 (such as a production tubing
20  string) is installed in the wellbore 12.   Interconnected in
    the tubular string 22 are multiple well screens 24, variable
    flow resistance systems 25 and packers 26.
          The packers 26 seal off an annulus 28 formed radially
    between the tubular string 22 and the wellbore section 18.
25  In this manner, fluids 30 may be produced from multiple
    intervals or zones of the formation 20 via isolated portions
    of the annulus 28 between adjacent pairs of the packers 26.
          Positioned between each adjacent pair of the packers
    26, a well screen 24 and a variable flow resistance system
30  25 are interconnected in the tubular string 22. The well

                                - 6
    screen 24 filters the fluids 30 flowing into the tubular
    string 22 from the annulus 28. The variable flow resistance
    system 25 variably restricts flow of the fluids 30 into the
    tubular string 22, based on certain characteristics of the
  5 fluids.
         At this point, it should be noted that the system 10 is
    illustrated in the drawings and is described herein as
    merely one example of a wide variety of systems in which the
    principles of this disclosure can be utilized. It should be
10  clearly understood that the principles of this disclosure
    are not limited at all to any of the details of the system
    10, or components thereof, depicted in the drawings or
    described herein.
         For example, it is not necessary in keeping with the
15  principles of this disclosure for the wellbore 12 to-include
    a generally vertical wellbore section 14 or a generally
    horizontal wellbore section 18. It is not necessary for
    fluids 30 to be only produced from the formation 20 since,
    in other examples, fluids could be injected into a
20  formation, fluids could be both injected into and produced
    from a formation, etc.
         It is not necessary for one each of the well screen 24
    and variable flow resistance system 25 to be positioned
    between each adjacent pair of the packers 26. It is not
25  necessary for a single variable flow resistance system 25 to
    be used in conjunction with a single well screen 24. Any
    number, arrangement and/or combination of these components
    may be used.
         It is not necessary for any variable flow resistance
30  system 25 to be used with a well screen 24. For example, in
    injection operations, the injected fluid could be flowed

                                 - 7
    through a variable flow resistance system 25, without also
    flowing through a well screen 24.
          It is not necessary for the well screens 24, variable
    flow resistance systems 25, packers 26 or any other
  5 components of the tubular string 22 to be positioned in
    uncased sections 14,  18 of the wellbore 12. Any section of
    the wellbore 12 may be cased or uncased, and any portion of
    the tubular string 22 may be positioned in an uncased or
    cased section of the wellbore, in keeping with the
10  principles of this disclosure.
          It should be clearly understood, therefore, that this
    disclosure describes how to make and use certain examples,
    but the principles of the disclosure are not limited to any
    details of those examples. Instead, those principles can be
15  applied to a variety of other examples using the knowledge
    obtained from this disclosure.
         It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that
    it would be beneficial to be able to regulate flow of the
    fluids 30 into the tubular string 22 from each zone of the
20  formation 20,  for example, to prevent water coning 32 or gas
    coning 34 in the formation. Other uses for flow regulation
    in a well include, but are not limited to, balancing
    production from (or injection into) multiple zones,
    minimizing production or injection of undesired fluids,
25  maximizing production or injection of desired fluids,
    transmitting signals,  etc.
         In examples described below, resistance to flow through
    the flow resistance systems 25 can be selectively varied, on
    demand and/or in response to a particular condition. For
30  example, flow through the systems 25 could be relatively
    restricted while the tubular string 22 is installed, and
    during a gravel packing operation, but flow through the

                                - 8
    systems could be relatively unrestricted when producing the
    fluid 30 from the formation 20. As another example, flow
    through the systems 25 could be relatively restricted at
    elevated temperature indicative of steam breakthrough in a
  5 steam flooding operation, but flow through the systems could
    be relatively unrestricted at reduced temperatures.
         An example of the variable flow resistance systems 25
    described more fully below can also increase resistance to
    flow if a fluid velocity or density increases (e.g., to
10  thereby balance flow among zones, prevent water or gas
    coning, etc.), or increase resistance to flow if a fluid
    viscosity decreases (e.g., to thereby restrict flow of an
    undesired fluid, such as water or gas, in an oil producing
    well). Conversely, these variable flow resistance systems 25
15  can decrease resistance to flow if fluid velocity or density
    decreases, or if fluid viscosity increases.
         Whether a fluid is a desired or an undesired fluid
    depends on the purpose of the production or injection
    operation being conducted. For example, if it is desired to
20  produce oil from a well, but not to produce water or gas,
    then oil is a desired fluid and water and gas are undesired
    fluids. If it is desired to inject steam instead of water,
    then steam is a desired fluid and water is an undesired
    fluid. If it is desired to produce hydrocarbon gas and not
25  water, then hydrocarbon gas is a desired fluid and water is
    an undesired fluid.
         Note that, at downhole temperatures and pressures,
    hydrocarbon gas can actually be completely or partially in
    liquid phase. Thus, it should be understood that when the
30  term "gas" is used herein, supercritical, liquid and/or
    gaseous phases are included within the scope of that term.

                                - 9
         Referring additionally now to FIG. 2, an enlarged scale
    cross-sectional view of one of the variable flow resistance
    systems 25 and a portion of one of the well screens 24 is
    representatively illustrated. In this example, a fluid
  5 composition 36 (which can include one or more fluids, such
    as oil and water, liquid water and steam, oil and gas, gas
    and water, oil, water and gas, etc.)  flows into the well
    screen 24, is thereby filtered, and then flows into an inlet
    38 of the variable flow resistance system 25.
10       A fluid composition can include one or more undesired
    or desired fluids. Both steam and liquid water can be
    combined in a fluid composition. As another example, oil,
    water and/or gas can be combined in a fluid composition.
         Flow of the fluid composition 36 through the variable
15  flow resistance system 25 is resisted based on one or more
    characteristics (such as viscosity, velocity, density, etc.)
    of the fluid composition. The fluid composition 36 is then
    discharged from the variable flow resistance system 25 to an
    interior of the tubular string 22 via an outlet 40.
20       In other examples, the well screen 24 may not be used
    in conjunction with the variable flow resistance system 25
    (e.g., in injection operations), the fluid composition 36
    could flow in an opposite direction through the various
    elements of the well system 10 (e.g., in injection
25  operations), a single variable flow resistance system could
    be used in conjunction with multiple well screens, multiple
    variable flow resistance systems could be used with one or
    more well screens, the fluid composition could be received
    from or discharged into regions of a well other than an
30  annulus or a tubular string, the fluid composition could
    flow through the variable flow resistance system prior to
    flowing through the well screen, any other components could

                               - 10
   be interconnected upstream or downstream of the well screen
   and/or variable flow resistance system, etc. Thus, it will
   be appreciated that the principles of this disclosure are
   not limited at all to the details of the example depicted in
 5 FIG. 2 and described herein.
        Although the well screen 24 depicted in FIG. 2 is of
   the type known to those skilled in the art as a wire-wrapped
   well screen, any other types or combinations of well screens
   (such as sintered, expanded, pre-packed, wire mesh, etc.)
10 may be used in other examples. Additional components (such
   as shrouds, shunt tubes, lines, instrumentation, sensors,
   inflow control devices, etc.) may also be used, if desired.
        The variable flow resistance system 25 is depicted in
   simplified form in FIG. 2, but in a preferred example, the
15 system can include various passages and devices for
   performing various functions, as described more fully below.
   In addition, the system 25 preferably at least partially
   extends circumferentially about the tubular string 22, or
   the system may be formed in a wall of a tubular structure
20 interconnected as part of the tubular string.
        In other examples, the system 25 may not extend
   circumferentially about a tubular string or be formed in a
   wall of a tubular structure. For example, the system 25
   could be formed in a flat structure, etc. The system 25
25 could be in a separate housing that is attached to the
   tubular string 22, or it could be oriented so that the axis
   of the outlet 40 is parallel to the axis of the tubular
   string. The system 25 could be on a logging string or
   attached to a device that is not tubular in shape. Any
30 orientation or configuration of the system 25 may be used in
   keeping with the principles of this disclosure.

                                 - 11
          Referring additionally now to FIG. 3, a cross-sectional
    view of the variable flow resistance system 25, taken along
    line 3-3 of FIG. 2, is representatively illustrated. The
    variable flow resistance system 25 example depicted in FIG.
  5 3 may be used in the well system 10 of FIGS.   1 & 2, or it
    may be used in other well systems in keeping with the
    principles of this disclosure.
          In FIG. 3, it may be seen that the fluid composition 36
    flows from the inlet 38 to the outlet 40 via passage 44,
10  inlet flow paths 46, 48 and a flow chamber 50. The flow
    paths 46, 48 are branches of the passage 44 and intersect
    the chamber 50 at inlets 52, 54.
         Although in FIG. 3 the flow paths 46, 48 diverge from
    the inlet passage 44 by approximately the same angle, in
15  other examples the flow paths 46, 48 may not be symmetrical
    with respect to the passage 44. For example, the flow path
    48 could diverge from the inlet passage 44 by a smaller
    angle as compared to the flow path 46, so that more of the
    fluid composition 36 will flow through the flow path 48 to
20  the chamber 50, and vice versa.
         A resistance to flow of the fluid composition 36
    through the system 25 depends on proportions of the fluid
    composition which flow into the chamber via the respective
    flow paths 46,  48 and inlets 52, 54. As depicted in FIG. 3,
25  approximately half of the fluid composition 36 flows into
    the chamber 50 via the flow path 46 and inlet 52, and about
    half of the fluid composition flows into the chamber via the
    flow path 48 and inlet 54.
         In this situation, flow through the system 25 is
30  relatively unrestricted. The fluid composition 36 can
    readily flow between various vane-type structures 56 in the
    chamber 50 en route to the outlet 40.

                                 -  12
           Referring additionally now to FIG. 4, the system 25 is
     representatively illustrated in another configuration, in
    which flow resistance through the system is increased, as
    compared to the configuration of FIG. 3. This increase in
  5  flow resistance of the system 25 can be due to a change in a
    property of the fluid composition 36, due to a change in the
    configuration of the system 25, etc.
          A greater proportion of the fluid composition 36 flows
    through the flow path 46 and into the chamber 50 via the
10  inlet 52, as compared to the proportion which flows into the
    chamber via the inlet 54. When a majority of the fluid
    composition 36 flows into the chamber 50 via the inlet 52,
    the fluid composition tends to rotate counter-clockwise in
    the chamber (as viewed in FIG. 4).
15        The structures 56 are designed to promote such
    rotational flow in the chamber 50, and as a result, more
    energy in the fluid composition 36 flow is dissipated. Thus,
    resistance to flow through the system 25 is increased in the
    FIG. 4 configuration as compared to the FIG. 3
20  configuration.
          Although in FIGS. 3 & 4 the flow chamber 50 has
    multiple inlets 52,   54, any number (including one) of inlets
    may be used in keeping with the scope of this disclosure.
    For example, in U.S. application serial no. 12/792117, filed
25  on 2 June 2010, a flow chamber is described which has only a
    single inlet, but resistance to flow through the chamber
    varies depending on via which flow path a majority of a
    fluid composition enters the chamber.
          Another configuration of the variable flow resistance
30  system 25 is representatively illustrated in FIGS. 5 & 6. In
    this configuration, flow resistance through the system 25

                               - 13
   can be varied due to a change in a property of the fluid
   composition 36.
         In FIG. 5, the fluid composition 36 has a relatively
   high velocity. As the fluid composition 36 flows through the
 5 passage 44, it passes multiple chambers 64 formed in a side
   of the passage. Each of the chambers 64 is in communication
   with a pressure-operated fluid switch 66.
        At elevated velocities of the fluid composition 36 in
   the passage 44, a reduced pressure will be applied to the
10 fluid switch 66 as a result of the fluid composition flowing
   past the chambers 64, and the fluid composition will be
   influenced to flow toward the branch flow path 48, as
   depicted in FIG. 5. A majority of the fluid composition 36
   flows into the chamber 50 via the inlet 54, and flow
15 resistance through the system 25 is increased. At lower
   velocities and increased viscosities, more of the fluid
   composition 36 will flow into the chamber 50 via the inlet
   52, and flow resistance through the system 25 is decreased
   due to less rotational flow in the chamber.
20      In FIG. 6, rotational flow of the fluid composition 36
   in the chamber 50 is reduced, and the resistance to flow
   through the system 25 is, thus, also reduced. Note that, if
   the velocity of the fluid composition 36 in the passage 44
   is reduced, or if the viscosity of the fluid composition is
25 increased, a portion of the fluid composition can flow into
   the chambers 64 and to the fluid switch 66, which influences
   the fluid composition to flow more toward the flow path 46.
        At relatively high velocities, low viscosity and/or
   high density of the fluid composition 36, a majority of the
30 fluid composition will flow via the flow path 48 to the
   chamber 50, as depicted in FIG. 5, and such flow will be
   more restricted. At relatively low velocity, high viscosity

                                - 14
    and/or low density of the fluid composition 36, a majority
    of the fluid composition will flow via the flow path 46 to
    the chamber 50, as depicted in FIG. 6, and such flow will be
    less restricted.
  5      If oil is a desired fluid and water is an undesired
    fluid, then it will be appreciated that the system 25 of
    FIGS. 5 & 6 will result in less resistance to flow of the
    fluid composition 36 through the system when a ratio of
    desired to undesired fluid is increased, and greater
 10 resistance to flow when the ratio of desired to undesired
    fluid is decreased. This is due to oil having higher
    viscosity and less density as compared to water. Due to its
    higher viscosity, oil also generally flows at a slower
    velocity as compared to water, for a given pressure
15  differential across the system 25.
         However, in other examples, the chamber 50 and
    structures 56 could be otherwise configured (e.g., reversed
    from their FIGS. 5 & 6 configuration, as in the FIGS. 3 & 4
    configuration), so that flow of a majority of the fluid
20  composition 36 through the flow path 46 is more restricted
    as compared to flow of a majority of the fluid composition
    through the flow path 48. An increased ratio of desired to
    undesired fluid can result in greater or lesser restriction
    to flow through the system 25, depending on its
25  configuration. Thus, the scope of this disclosure is not
    limited at all to the details of the specific flow
    resistance systems 25 described herein.
         In the FIGS. 3 & 4 configuration, a majority of the
    fluid composition 36 will continue to flow via one of the
30  flow paths 46, 48 (due to the Coanda effect), or will flow
    relatively equally via both flow paths 46, 48, unless the
    direction of the flow from the passage 44 is changed. In the

                                - 15
    FIGS. 5 & 6 configuration, the direction of the flow from
    the passage 44 can be changed by means of the fluid switch
    66, which influences the fluid composition 36 to flow toward
    one of the two flow paths 46, 48. In other examples, greater
  5 or fewer numbers of flow paths may be used, if desired.
         In the further description below, additional techniques
    for influencing the direction of flow of the fluid
    composition 36 through the system 25, and variably resisting
    the flow of the fluid composition, are described. These
10  techniques may be used in combination with the
    configurations of FIGS. 3-6, or they may be used with other
    types of variable flow resistance systems.
         Referring additionally now to FIGS. 7-9, another
    configuration of the variable flow resistance system 25 is
15  representatively illustrated. This configuration is similar
    in some respects to the configuration of FIGS. 3-6, however,
    instead of the flow chamber 50, the configuration of FIGS.
    7-9 uses a structure 58 which displaces in response to a
    change in a proportion of the fluid composition 36 which
20  flows through the flow paths 46, 48 (that is, a ratio of the
    fluid composition which flows through one flow path and the
    fluid composition which flows through the other flow path).
         For example, in FIG. 8, a majority of the fluid
    composition 36 flows via the flow path 48, and this flow
25  impinging on the structure 58 causes the structure to
    displace to a position in which such flow is increasingly
    restricted. Note that, in FIG. 8, the structure 58 itself
    almost completely blocks the fluid composition 36 from
    flowing to the outlet 40.
30       In FIG. 9, a majority of the fluid composition 36 flows
    via the flow path 46 and, in response, the structure 58
    displaces to a position in which flow restriction in the

                              -  16
   system 25 is reduced. The structure 58 does not block the
   flow of the fluid composition 36 to the outlet 40 in FIG. 9
   as much as it does in FIG. 8.
        In other examples, the structure 58 itself may not
 5 block the flow of the fluid composition 36, and the
   structure could be biased toward the FIG. 8 and/or FIG. 9
   position (e.g., using springs, compressed gas, other biasing
   devices, etc.), thereby changing the proportion of the fluid
   composition 36 which must flow through a particular flow
10 path 46, 48, in order to displace the structure. Preferably,
   the fluid composition 36 does not have to exclusively flow
   through only one of the flow paths 46, 48 in order to
   displace the structure 58 to a particular position, but such
   a design could be implemented, if desired.
15      The structure 58 is mounted via a connection 60.
   Preferably, the connection 60 serves to secure the structure
   58, and also to resist a pressure differential applied
   across the structure from the flow paths 46, 48 to the
   outlet 40. When the fluid composition 36 is flowing through
20 the system 25, this pressure differential can exist, and the
   connection 60 can resist the resulting forces applied to the
   structure 58, while still permitting the structure to
   displace freely in response to a change in the proportion of
   the flow via the flow paths 46, 48.
25      In the FIGS. 8 & 9 example, the connection 60 is
   depicted as a pivoting or rotational connection. However, in
   other examples, the connection 60 could be a rigid, sliding,
   translating, or other type of connection, thereby allowing
   for displacement of the structure 58 in any of
30 circumferential, axial, longitudinal, lateral, radial, etc.,
   directions.

                               - 17
         In one example, the connection 60 could be a rigid
   connection, with a flexible beam 62 extending between the
   connection and the structure 58. The beam 62 could flex,
   instead of the connection 60 rotating, in order to allow the
 5 structure 58 to displace, and to provide a biasing force
   toward the more restricting position of FIG. 8, toward the
   less restricting position of FIG. 9, or toward any other
   position (e.g., a position between the more restricting and
   less restricting positions, etc.).
10      Another difference of the FIGS. 7-9 configuration and
   the configurations of FIGS. 3-6 is that the FIGS. 7-9
   configuration utilizes the fluid switch 66 with multiple
   control passages 68, 70. In comparison, the FIGS. 3 & 4
   configuration does not have a controlled fluid switch, and
15 the FIGS. 5 & 6 configuration utilizes the fluid switch 66
   with a single control passage 68. However, it should be
   understood that any fluid switch and any number of control
   passages can be used with any variable flow resistance
   system 25 configuration, in keeping with the scope of this
20 disclosure.
        As depicted in FIG. 7, the fluid switch 66 directs the
   fluid composition 36 flow toward the flow path 46 when flow
   72 through the control passage 68 is toward the fluid
   switch, and/or when flow 74 in the control passage 70 is
25 away from the fluid switch. The fluid switch 66 directs the
   fluid composition 36 flow toward the flow path 48 when flow
   72 through the control passage 68 is away from the fluid
   switch, and/or when flow 74 in the control passage 70 is
   toward the fluid switch.
30      Thus, since the proportion of the fluid composition 36
   which flows through the flow paths 46, 48 can be changed by
   the fluid switch 66, in response to the flows 72,  74 through

                                - 18
    the control passages 68, 70, it follows that the resistance
    to flow of the fluid composition 36 through the system 25
    can be changed by changing the flows through the control
    passages. For this purpose, the control passages 68, 70 may
  5 be connected to any of a variety of devices for influencing
    the flows 72,  74 through the control passages.
         For example, the chambers 64 of the FIGS. 5 & 6
    configuration could.be connected to the control passage 68
    or 70, and another set of chambers, or another device could
10  be connected to the other control passage. The flows 72, 74
    through the control passages 68, 70 could be automatically
    changed (e.g., using the chambers 64, etc.)  in response to
    changes in one or more properties (such as density,
    viscosity, velocity, etc.)  of the fluid composition 36, the
15  flows could be controlled locally (e.g., in response to
    sensor measurements, etc.), or the flows could be controlled
    remotely (e.g., from the earth's surface, another remote
    location, etc.). Any technique for controlling the flows 72,
    74 through the control passages 68,  70 may be used, in
20  keeping with the scope of this disclosure.
         Preferably, the flow 72 is toward the fluid switch 66,
    and/or the flow 74 is away from the fluid switch, when the
    fluid composition 36 has an increased ratio of desired to
    undesired fluids, so that more of the fluid composition will
25  be directed by the fluid switch to flow toward the flow path
    46, thereby reducing the resistance to flow through the
    system 25. Conversely, the flow 72 is preferably away from
    the fluid switch 66, and/or the flow 74 is preferably toward
    the fluid switch, when the fluid composition 36 has a
30  decreased ratio of desired to undesired fluids, so that more
    of the fluid composition will be directed by the fluid
    switch to flow toward the flow path 48, thereby increasing
    the resistance to flow through the system 25.

                                 - 19
          Referring additionally now to FIGS. 10 & 11, another
     configuration of the variable flow resistance system 25 is
     representatively illustrated. In this configuration, the
     structure 58 rotates about the connection 60, in order to
  5 change between a less restricted flow position (FIG. 10)   and
    a more restricted flow position (FIG. 11).
          As in the configuration of FIGS. 7-9, the configuration
    of FIGS. 10 & 11 has the structure 58 exposed to flow in
    both of the flow paths 46, 48. Depending on a proportion of
10  these flows, the structure 58 can displace to either of the
    FIGS. 10 & 11 positions (or to any position in-between those
    positions).  The structure 58 in the FIGS. 7-11
    configurations can be biased toward any position, or
    releasably retained at any position, in order to adjust the
15  proportion of flows through the flow paths 46, 48 needed to
    displace the structure to another position.
          Referring additionally now to FIGS. 12 & 13, another
    configuration of the variable flow resistance system 25 is
    representatively illustrated. In this configuration, the
20  structure 58 is positioned in the flow chamber 50 connected
    to the flow paths 46, 48.
          In the FIGS. 12 & 13 example, a majority of the flow of
    the fluid composition 36 through the flow path 46 results in
    the structure 58 rotating about the connection 60 to a
25  position in which flow between the structures 56 (the
    structures comprising circumferentially extending vanes in
    this example) is not blocked by the structure 58. However,
    if a majority of the flow is through the flow path 48 to the
    flow chamber 50, the structure 58 will rotate to a position
30  in which the structure 58 does substantially block the flow
    between the structures 56, thereby increasing the flow
    resistance.

                                 - 20
          Referring additionally now to FIG. 14, another
    configuration of the variable flow resistance system 25 is
    representatively illustrated. In this example, the flow path
    46 connects to the chamber 50 in more of a radial, rather
  5 than a tangential) direction, as compared to the
    configuration of FIGS.   12 & 13.
          In addition, the structures 56, 58 are spaced to allow
    relatively direct flow of the fluid composition 36 from the
    inlet 54 to the outlet 40. This configuration can be
10  especially beneficial where the fluid composition 36 is
    directed by the fluid switch 66 toward the flow path 46 when
    the fluid composition has an increased ratio of desired to
    undesired fluids therein.
          In this example, an increased proportion of the fluid
15  composition 36 flowing through the flow path 48 will cause
    the flow to be more rotational in the chamber 50, thereby
    dissipating more energy and increasingly restricting the
    flow, and will cause the structure 58 to rotate to a
    position in which flow between the structures 56 is more
20  restricted. This situation preferably occurs when the ratio
    of desired to undesired fluids in the fluid composition 36
    decreases.
         Referring additionally now to FIGS. 15 & 16, additional
    configurations of the fluid switch 66 are representatively
25  illustrated. The fluid switch 66 in these configurations has
    a blocking device 76 which rotates about a connection 78 to
    increasingly block flow through one of the flow paths 46, 48
    when the fluid switch directs the flow toward the other flow
    path. These fluid switch 66 configurations may be used in
30  any system 25 configuration.
         In the FIG. 15 example, either or both of the control
    passage flows 72,  74 influence the fluid composition 36 to

                                - 21
    flow toward the flow path 46. Due to this flow toward the
    flow path 46 impinging on the blocking device 76, the
    blocking device rotates to a position in which the other
    flow path 48 is completely or partially blocked, thereby
  5 influencing an even greater proportion of the fluid
    composition to flow via the flow path 46, and not via the
    flow path 48. However, if either or both of the control
    passage flows 72,  74 influence the fluid composition 36 to
    flow toward the flow path 48, this flow impinging on the
10  blocking device 76 will rotate the blocking device to a
    position in which the other flow path 46 is completely or
    partially blocked, thereby influencing an even greater
    proportion of the fluid composition to flow via the flow
    path 48, and not via the flow path 46.
15       In the FIG. 16 example, either or both of the control
    passage flows 72, 74 influence the blocking device 76 to
    increasingly block one of the flow paths 46, 48. Thus, an
    increased proportion of the fluid composition 36 will flow
    through the flow path 46, 48 which is less blocked by the
20  device 76. When either or both of the flows 72, 74 influence
    the blocking device 76 to increasingly block the flow path
    46, the blocking device rotates to a position in which the
    other flow path 48 is not blocked, thereby influencing a
    greater proportion of the fluid composition to flow via the
25  flow path 48, and not via the flow path 46. However, if
    either or both of the control passage flows 72,  74 influence
    the blocking device 76 to rotate toward the flow path 48,
    the other flow path 46 will not be blocked, and a greater
    proportion of the fluid composition 36 will flow via the
30  flow path 46, and not via the flow path 48.
         By increasing the proportion of the fluid composition
    36 which flows through the flow path 46 or 48, operation of
    the system 25 is made more efficient. For example,

                                - 22
    resistance to flow through the system 25 can be readily
    increased when an unacceptably low ratio of desired to
    undesired fluids exists in the fluid composition 36, and
    resistance to flow through the system can be readily
  5 decreased when the fluid composition has a relatively high
    ratio of desired to undesired fluids.
          Referring additionally now to FIGS. 17 & 18, another
    configuration of the system 25 is representatively
    illustrated. This configuration is similar in some respects
10  to the configuration of FIGS. 12 & 13, in that the structure
    58 rotates in the chamber 50 in order to change the
    resistance to flow. The direction of rotation of the
    structure 58 depends on through which of the flow paths 46
    or 48 a greater proportion of the fluid composition 36
15  flows.
         In the FIGS. 17 & 18 example, the structure 58 includes
    vanes 80 on which the fluid composition 36 impinges. Thus,
    rotational flow in the chamber 50 impinges on the vanes 80
    and biases the structure 58 to rotate in the chamber.
20       When the structure 58 is in the position depicted in
    FIGS. 17 & 18, openings 82 align with openings 84, and the
    structure does not substantially block flow from the chamber
    50. However, if the structure 58 rotates to a position in
    which the openings 82, 84 are misaligned, then the structure
25  will increasingly block flow from the chamber 50 and
    resistance to flow will be increased.
         Although in certain examples described above, the
    structure 58 displaces by pivoting or rotating, it will be
    appreciated that the structure could be suitably designed to
30  displace in any direction to thereby change the flow
    resistance through the system 25. In various examples, the

                                 - 23
     structure 58 could displace in circumferential, axial,
     longitudinal, lateral and/or radial directions.
          Referring additionally now to FIG. 19, another
    configuration of the chamber 50 is representatively
  5 illustrated. The FIG. 19 chamber 50 may be used with any
    configuration of the system 25.
          One difference between the FIG. 19 chamber 50 and the
    other chambers described herein is that a swellable material
    86 is provided at the inlets 52, 54 to the chamber, and a
10  swellable material 88 is provided about the outlet 40.
    Preferably, the swellable materials 86, 88 swell in response
    to contact with an undesirable fluids (such as water or gas,
    etc.) and do not swell in response to contact with desirable
    fluids   (such as liquid hydrocarbons, gas, etc.). However, in
15  other examples, the materials 86, 88 could swell in response
    to contact with desirable fluids.
          In the FIG. 19 example, the swellable materials 86 at
    the inlets 52, 54 are shaped like vanes or airfoils, so that
    the fluid composition 36 is influenced to flow more
20  rotationally (as indicated by arrows 36a) through the
    chamber 50, instead of more radially (as indicated by arrows
    36b),  when the material swells. Since more energy is
    dissipated when there is more rotational flow in the chamber
    50, this results in more resistance to flow through the
25  system 25.
          The swellable material 88 is positioned about the
    outlet 40 so that, as the ratio of desired to undesired
    fluid in the fluid composition 36 decreases, the material
    will swell and thereby increasingly restrict flow through
30  the outlet. Thus, the swellable material 88 can increasingly
    block flow through the system 25, in response to contact
    with the undesired fluid.

                               - 24
         It will be appreciated that the swellable materials 86
   change the direction of flow of the fluid composition 36
   through the chamber 50 to thereby change the flow
   resistance, and the swellable material 88 selectively blocks
 5 flow through the system to thereby change the flow
   resistance. In other examples, the swellable materials 86
   could change the direction of flow at locations other than
   the inlets 52,  54, and the swellable material 88 can block
   flow at locations other than the outlet 40, in keeping with
10 the scope of this disclosure.
        The swellable materials 86, 88 in the FIG. 19 example
   allow for flow resistance to be increased as the ratio of
   desired to undesired fluid in the fluid composition 36
   decreases. However, in other examples, the swellable
15 materials 86, 88 could swell in response to contact with a
   desired fluid, or the flow resistance through the system 25
   could be decreased as the ratio of desired to undesired
   fluid in the fluid composition 36 decreases.
        The term "swell" and similar terms   (such as
20 "swellable") are used herein to indicate an increase in
   volume of a swellable material. Typically, this increase in
   volume is due to incorporation of molecular components of an
   activating agent into the swellable material itself, but
   other swelling mechanisms or techniques may be used, if
25 desired. Note that swelling is not the same as expanding,
   although a material may expand as a result of swelling.
        The activating agent which causes swelling of the
   swellable material can be a hydrocarbon fluid (such as oil
   or gas, etc.), or a non-hydrocarbon fluid (such as water or
30 steam, etc.).  In the well system 10, the swellable material
   may swell when the fluid composition 36 comprises the
   activating agent (e.g., when the activating agent enters the

                              -  25
   wellbore 12 from the formation 20 surrounding the wellbore,
   when the activating agent is circulated to the system 25, or
   when the activating agent is released downhole, etc.). In
   response, the swellable materials 86, 88 swell and thereby
 5 change the flow resistance through the system 25.
        The activating agent which causes swelling of the
   swellable material could be comprised in any type of fluid.
   The activating agent could be naturally present in the well,
   or it could be conveyed with the system 25, conveyed
10 separately or flowed into contact with the swellable
   material in the well when desired. Any manner of contacting
   the activating agent with the swellable material may be used
   in keeping with the scope of this disclosure.
        Various swellable materials are known to those skilled
15 in the art, which materials swell when contacted with water
   and/or hydrocarbon fluid, so a comprehensive list of these
   materials will not be presented here. Partial lists of
   swellable materials may be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 3385367
   and 7059415, and in U.S. Published Application No. 2004
20 0020662, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated
   herein by this reference.
        As another alternative, the swellable material may have
   a substantial portion of cavities therein which are
   compressed or collapsed at surface conditions. Then, after
25 being placed in the well at a higher pressure, the material
   swells by the cavities filling with fluid.
        This type of apparatus and method might be used where
   it is desired to expand the swellable material in the
   presence of gas rather than oil or water. A suitable
30 swellable material is described in U.S. Published
   Application No. 2007-0257405, the entire disclosure of which
   is incorporated herein by this reference.

                                - 26
          The swellable material used in the system 25 may swell
    by diffusion of hydrocarbons into the swellable material, or
    in the case of a water swellable material, by the water
    being absorbed by a super-absorbent material (such as
  5 cellulose, clay, etc.) and/or through osmotic activity with
    a salt-like material.   Hydrocarbon-, water- and gas
    swellable materials may be combined, if desired.
          The swellable material could swell due to the presence
    of ions in a fluid. For example, polymer hydrogels will
10  swell due to changes in the pH of a fluid, which is a
    measure of the hydrogen ions in the fluid (or, equivalently,
    the concentration of hydroxide, OH, ions in the fluid).
    Swelling as a result of the salt ions in the fluid is also
    possible. Such a swellable material could swell depending on
15  a concentration of chloride, sodium, calcium, and/or
    potassium ions in the fluid.
         It should, thus, be clearly understood that any
    swellable material which dwells when contacted by a
    predetermined activating agent may be used in keeping with
20  the scope of this disclosure. The swellable material could
    also swell in response to contact with any of multiple
    activating agents. For example, the swellable material could
    swell when contacted by hydrocarbon fluid and/or when
    contacted by water and/or when contacted by certain ions.
25       Referring additionally now to FIGS. 20-27, additional
    configurations of the fluid switch 66 are representatively
    illustrated. These fluid switch 66 configurations may be
    used with any configuration of the system 25.
         In the FIG. 20 example, the fluid switch 66 includes an
30  airfoil 90. The airfoil 90 rotates about a pivot connection
    92. Preferably, the airfoil 90 is biased (for example, using
    a torsion spring, magnetic biasing devices, actuator, etc.),

                              -  27
   so that it initially directs flow of the fluid composition
   36 toward one of the flow paths 46, 48. In FIG. 20, the
   airfoil 90 is positioned to direct the fluid composition 36
   toward the flow path 48.
 5      It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art
   that, as the velocity of the flow increases, a lift produced
   by the airfoil 90 also increases, and eventually can
   overcome the biasing force applied to the airfoil, allowing
   the airfoil to pivot about the connection 92 to a position
10 in which the airfoil directs the fluid composition 36 toward
   the other flow path 46. The lift produced by the airfoil 90
   can also vary depending on other properties of the fluid
   composition 36 (e.g., density, viscosity, etc.).
        Thus, the airfoil 90 allows the fluid switch 66 to be
15 operated automatically, in response to changes in the
   properties of the fluid composition 36. Instead of the
   magnetic biasing device 94, the airfoil 90 itself could be
   made of a magnetic material.
        The magnetic biasing devices 94, 96, 98 can be used to
20 bias the airfoil 90 toward either or both of the positions
   in which the airfoil directs the fluid composition 36 toward
   the flow paths 46, 48. The magnetic biasing devices 96, 98
   could be positioned further upstream or downstream from
   their illustrated positions, and they can extend into the
25 flow paths 46, 48, if desired. The magnetic biasing devices
   94, 96, 98 (or other types of biasing devices) may be used
   to bias the airfoil 90 toward any position, in keeping with
   the scope of this disclosure.
        In the configuration of FIG. 21, multiple airfoils 90
30 are used. As illustrated, two of the airfoils 90 are used,
   but it will be appreciated that any number of airfoils could
   be used in other examples.

                              -  28
        The airfoils 90 may be constrained to pivot together
   (e.g., with a mechanical linkage, synchronized stepper
   motors, etc.), or the airfoils may be permitted to pivot
   independently of each other. As depicted in FIG. 21, a
 5 torsional biasing force 100 is applied to each of the
   airfoils 90. This biasing force 100 could be applied by any
   suitable means, such as, one or more rotary actuators,
   torsion springs, biasing devices 96, 98, etc.).
        In the configuration of FIG. 22, the multiple airfoils
10 90 are both laterally and longitudinally spaced apart from
   each other. In addition, the airfoils 90 can be displaced in
   both lateral and longitudinal directions 102, 104 (e.g.,
   using linear actuators, etc.), in order to position the
   airfoils as desired.
15      In the configuration of FIG. 23, the multiple airfoils
   90 are longitudinally spaced apart. In some examples, the
   airfoils 90 could be directly inline with each other.
        In the FIG. 23 example, the upstream airfoil 90 directs
   the flow of the fluid composition 36, so that it is
20 advantageously directed toward the downstream airfoil.
   However, other purposes could be served by longitudinally
   spacing apart the airfoils 90, in keeping with the scope of
   this disclosure.
        In the configuration of FIG. 24, airfoil-like surfaces
25 are formed on the walls of the fluid switch 66. In this
   manner, the fluid composition 36 is preferentially directed
   toward the flow path 48 at certain conditions (e.g., high
   flow velocity, low viscosity, etc.). However, at other
   conditions (e.g., low flow velocity, high viscosity, etc.),
30 the fluid composition 36 is able to flow relatively equally
   to the flow paths 46, 48.

                              - 29
        In the FIG. 25 example, a wedge-shaped blockage 106 is
   positioned upstream of the airfoil 90. The blockage 106
   serves to influence the flow of the fluid composition 36
   over the airfoil 90. The blockage 106 could also be a
 5 magnetic device for applying a biasing force to the airfoil
   90.
        In the FIG. 26 example, cylindrical projections 108 are
   positioned on opposite lateral sides of the fluid switch 66.
   The cylindrical projections 108 serve to influence the flow
10 of the fluid composition 36 over the airfoil 90. The
   cylindrical projections 108 could also be magnetic devices
   (such as, magnetic biasing devices 96, 98) for applying a
   biasing force to the airfoil 90.
        In the FIG. 27 example, a cylindrical blockage 110 is
15 positioned upstream of the airfoil 90. The blockage 110
   serves to influence the flow of the fluid composition 36
   over the airfoil 90. The blockage 110 could also be a
   magnetic device for applying a biasing force to the airfoil
   90.
20      It may now be fully appreciated that this disclosure
   provides significant advancements to the art of variably
   resisting flow in conjunction with well operations. In
   multiple examples described above, flow resistance can be
   reliably and efficiently increased when there is a
25 relatively large ratio of desired to undesired fluid in the
   fluid composition 36, and/or flow resistance can be
   decreased when there is a reduced ratio of desired to
   undesired fluid in the fluid composition.
        A variable flow resistance system 25 for use with a
30 subterranean well is described above. In one example, the
   system 25 includes a structure 58 which displaces in
   response to a flow of a fluid composition 36, whereby a

                              - 30
   resistance to the flow of the fluid composition 36 changes
   in response to a change in a ratio of desired to undesired
   fluid in the fluid composition 36.
        The structure 58 may be exposed to the flow of the
 5 fluid composition 36 in multiple directions, and the
   resistance to the flow can change in response to a change in
   a proportion of the fluid composition 36 which flows in
   those directions.
        The structure 58 can be more biased in one direction by
10 the flow of the fluid composition 36 more in one direction,
   and the structure 58 can be more biased in another direction
   by the flow of the fluid composition 36 more in the second
   direction.
        The first and second directions may be opposite
15 directions. The directions can comprise at least one of the
   group including circumferential, axial, longitudinal,
   lateral, and radial directions.
        The system 25 can include a fluid switch 66 which
   directs the flow of the fluid composition 36 to at least two
20 flow paths 46, 48.
        The structure 58 may be more biased in one direction by
   the flow of the fluid composition 36 more through the first
   flow path 46, and the structure may be more biased in a
   another direction by the flow of the fluid composition 36
25 more through the second flow path 48.
        The structure 58 may pivot or rotate, and thereby vary
   the resistance to flow, in response to a change in a
   proportion of the fluid composition 36 which flows through
   the first and second flow paths 46, 48.

                                - 31
         The structure 58 may rotate, and thereby vary the
    resistance to flow, in response to the change in the ratio
    of desired to undesired fluids.
         The fluid switch 66 can comprise a blocking device 76
  5 which at least partially blocks the flow of the fluid
    composition 36 through at least one of the first and second
    flow paths 46, 48. The blocking device 76 may increasingly
    block one of the first and second flow paths 46, 48, in
    response to the flow of the fluid composition 36 toward the
10  other of the first and second flow paths 46, 48.
         The fluid switch 66 may direct the flow of the fluid
    composition 36 toward one of the first and second flow paths
    46, 48 in response to the blocking device 76 increasingly
    blocking the other of the first and second flow paths 46,
15  48.
         The system 25 can include an airfoil 90 which deflects
    the flow of the fluid composition 36 in response to the
    change in the ratio of desired to undesired fluid.
         The system 25 can include a material 86, 88 which
20  swells in response to a decrease in the ratio of desired to
    undesired fluid, whereby the resistance to flow is
    increased.
         In some examples, the resistance to flow decreases -in
    response to an increase in the ratio of desired to undesired
25  fluid. In some examples, the resistance to flow increases in
    response to a decrease in the ratio of desired to undesired
    fluid.
         Also described above is another variable flow
    resistance system 25 example in which a structure 58 rotates
30  in response to flow of a fluid composition 36, and a fluid
    switch 66 deflects the fluid composition 36 relative to at

                                - 32
     least first and second flow paths 46, 48, and a resistance
    to the flow of the fluid composition 36 through the system
    25 changes in response to a change in a ratio of desired to
    undesired fluid in the fluid composition 36.
  5       The structure 58 may be exposed to the flow of the
    fluid composition 36 through the first and second flow paths
    46, 48, and the resistance to the flow can change in
    response to a change in a proportion of the fluid
    composition 36 which flows through the first and second flow
10  paths 46, 48.
          In another example, a variable flow resistance system
    25 can include a chamber 50 through which a fluid
    composition 36 flows, whereby a resistance to a flow of the
    fluid composition 36 through the chamber 50 varies in
15  response to a change in a direction of the flow through the
    chamber 50. A material 86, 88 swells in response to a
    decrease in a ratio of desired to undesired fluid in the
    fluid composition 36.
          The resistance to the flow can increase or decrease
20  when the material 86, 88 swells.
          The material 86, 88 may increasingly influence the
    fluid composition 36 to flow spirally through the chamber 50
    when the material 86, 88 swells.
          The material 88 may increasingly block the flow of the
25  fluid composition 36 through the system 25 when the material
    88 swells.
          The material 86 may increasingly deflect the flow of
    the fluid composition 36 when the material 36 swells.
          The system 25 can also include a structure 25 which
30  displaces in response to the flow of the fluid composition
    36, whereby the resistance to the flow of the fluid

                               - 33
   composition 36 increases in response to a decrease in the
   ratio of desired to undesired fluid. The structure 58 may
   rotate in response to the change in the ratio of desired to
   undesired fluid.
 5      Another variable flow resistance system 25 example
   described above can include at least first and second flow
   paths 46, 48, whereby a resistance to a flow of a fluid
   composition 36 through the system 25 changes in response to
   a change in a proportion of the fluid composition 36 which
10 flows through the first and second flow paths 46, 48. One or
   more airfoils 90 may change a deflection of the flow of the
   fluid composition 36 relative to the first and second flow
   paths 46, 48 in response to a change in a ratio of desired
   to undesired fluid in the fluid composition 36.
15      The airfoil 90 may rotate in response to the change in
   the ratio of desired to undesired fluid in the fluid
   composition 36.
        The airfoil 90 may change the deflection in response to
   a change in viscosity, velocity and/or density of the fluid
20 composition 36.
        The system 25 can include a magnetic biasing device 94,
   96 or 98 which exerts a magnetic force on the airfoil 90,
   whereby the airfoil 90 deflects the fluid composition 36
   toward a corresponding one of the first and second flow
25 paths 46, 48. The system 25 can include first and second
   magnetic biasing devices 94, 96 which exert magnetic forces
   on the airfoil 90, whereby the airfoil 90 deflects the fluid
   composition 36 toward respective ones of the first and
   second flow paths 46, 48.
30      The system 25 can include a structure 58 which
   displaces in response to the flow of the fluid composition
   36, whereby the resistance to the flow of the fluid

                              - 34
   composition 36 increases in response to a decrease in the
   ratio of desired to undesired fluid. The system 25 may
   include a structure 58 which rotates in response to the
   change in the ratio of desired to undesired fluid.
 5      The system 25 can comprise multiple airfoils 90. The
   airfoils 90 may be constrained to rotate together, or they
   may be allowed to displace independently of each other. The
   airfoils 90 may be displaceable laterally and longitudinally
   relative to the first and second flow paths 46, 48. The
10 airfoils 90 may be laterally and/or longitudinally spaced
   apart.
        A method of variably resisting flow in a subterranean
   well is also described above. In one example, the method can
   include a structure 58 displacing in response to a flow of a
15 fluid composition 36, and a resistance to the flow of the
   fluid composition 36 changing in response to a ratio of
   desired to undesired fluid in the fluid composition
   changing.
        The method may include exposing the structure 58 to the
20 flow of the fluid composition 36 in at least first and
   second directions. The resistance to the flow changing can
   be further in response to a change in a proportion of the
   fluid composition 36 which flows in the first and second
   directions.
25      The structure 58 may be increasingly biased in a first
   direction by the flow of the fluid composition 36
   increasingly in the first direction, and the structure 58
   may be increasingly biased in a second direction by the flow
   of the fluid composition 36 increasingly in the second
30 direction.
        The first direction may be opposite to the second
   direction. The first and second directions may comprise any

                                - 35
    of circumferential, axial, longitudinal, lateral, and radial
    directions.
          The method can include a fluid switch 66 directing the
    flow of the fluid composition 36 toward at least first and
  5 second flow paths 46, 48. The structure 58 may be
    increasingly biased in a first direction by the flow of the
    fluid composition 36 increasingly through the first flow
    path 46, and the structure 58 may be increasingly biased in
    a second direction by the flow of the fluid composition 36
10  increasingly through the second flow path 48.
         The structure 58 displacing may include the structure
    58 pivoting or rotating, and thereby varying the resistance
    to flow, in response to a change in a proportion of the
    fluid composition 36 which flows through the first and
15  second flow paths 46, 48.
         The structure 58 displacing may include the structure
    58 rotating, and thereby varying the resistance to flow, in
    response to the change in the ratio of desired to undesired
    fluids.
20       The method may include a blocking device 76 of the
    fluid switch 66 at least partially blocking the flow of the
    fluid composition 36 through at least one of the first and
    second flow paths 46, 48. The blocking device 76 can
    increasingly block one of the first and second flow paths
25  46, 48, in response to the flow of the fluid composition
    toward the other of the first and second flow paths.
         The fluid switch 66 can direct the flow of the fluid
    composition 36 toward one of the first and second flow paths
    46, 48 in response to the blocking device 76 increasingly
30  blocking the other of the first and second flow paths 46,
    48.

                               - 36
        The method may include an airfoil 90 deflecting the
   flow of the fluid composition 36 in response to the ratio of
   desired to undesired fluid changing.
        The method may include a material 86, 88 swelling in
 5 response to the ratio of desired to undesired fluid
   decreasing. The resistance to the flow changing can include
   the resistance to the flow increasing in response to the
   material 86, 88 swelling.
        The resistance to the flow changing can include the
10 resistance to the flow increasing or decreasing in response
   to the ratio of desired to undesired fluid increasing.

   swelling in response to the ratio of desired to undesired fluid
   decreasing, and wherein the resistance to the flow changing
25 further comprises the resistance to the flow increasing in
   response to the material swelling.
   16.  The method of claim 13,  further comprising the structure
   being increasingly biased in a first direction by the flow of
30 the fluid composition increasingly in the first direction, and
   the structure being increasingly biased in a second direction
   by the flow of the fluid composition increasingly in the second
   direction.

                                -  41
   17.  The method of claim 13,  further comprising a fluid switch
   directing the flow of the fluid composition toward at least
   first and second flow paths.

   being increasingly biased in a first direction by the flow of
   the fluid composition increasingly through the first flow path,
   and the structure being increasingly biased in a second
   direction by the flow of the fluid composition increasingly
10 through the second flow path.
   19.  The method of claim 13,  wherein the structure displacing
   further comprises the structure pivoting or rotating, and
   thereby varying the resistance to flow, in response to a change
15 in a proportion of the fluid composition which flows through
   the first and second flow paths.
   20.  The method of claim 13,  wherein the structure displacing
   further comprises the structure rotating, and thereby varying
20 the resistance to flow, in response to the change in the ratio
   of desired to undesired fluids.
   21.  The method of claim 13,  further comprising a blocking
   device of the fluid switch at least partially blocking the flow
25 of the fluid composition through at least one of the first and
