    [0004]
                  One of technologies for transmitting a high-data
   rate stream in digital broadcasting is a channel bonding
    (CB) technology which splits a high-data-rate stream into
 5 streams of a plurality of channels and transmits the
   split           streams from the transmission       side, and
   reconstructs the split streams of the plurality of
   channels into the original high-data-rate stream on the
   receiving side.
10  [0005]
                  At present, standards called DVB-S2x        (or DVB-S.2
   evo) is under preparation as improved standards from DVB
   S2.         Utilization of the CB technology for DVB-S2x has
   been investigated.

   Present Technology>
    [0019]
                  Fig. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a
   configuration example of a transmission system according
 5 to an embodiment of the present technology                          (system in
   this context is a logical collection of a plurality of
   devices disposed either within an identical housing or
   not).
    [0020]
10                The transmission               system illustrated in Fig. 1 is
   constituted by a transmitting device 11 and a receiving
   device 12.
    [0021]
                  The transmitting device 11 performs transmission of
15 television broadcasting programs,                         (including digital
   broadcasting                       and data transmission),   for example.   More
   specifically, the transmitting device 11                         splits a stream
   of target data corresponding to a transmission target,
   such as image data and audio data provided as a program,
20 into streams of a plurality of channels by utilizing a CB
   technology, and sends                        (transmits) the split streams via a
   transmission path 13                       such as a satellite channel, a
   terrestrial channel, and a cable                         (wired channel),  for
   example.
25  [0022]
                  The receiving device 12 receives streams of a
   plurality of channels transmitted from the transmitting
   device 11 via the transmission path 13,                         reconstructs the
   original stream, and outputs the reconstructed stream.
30  [0023]
                  The transmitting device 11 corresponds to a
   9810285_1 (GHMatters) P102691.AU.1

   broadcasting station of television broadcasting, for
   example, while the receiving device 12 corresponds to a
   TV set              (television             receiver)    at home.      Accordingly,   the
   transmitting device 11                          in the transmission system may be
 5 constituted by a plurality of devices, rather than only a
   single device.                        Similarly, the receiving device 12 may be
   constituted by a plurality of devices.

                  Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a
   configuration example of the transmitting device 11 in
   Fig. 1.
    [0026]
15                As illustrated in Fig. 2, the transmitting device
                                                                                    2 2
   11      includes a                 splitter     21,  N buffers      221 through      N,  N
                                                                      2 3
   channel processing units                           231 through         N, a symbol clock
   generation unit 26,                          and a time associated information
   generation unit 27.
20  [0027]
                  The transmitting device 11 receives a stream of
   target data as an input stream, such as a high-data-rate
   transport stream                          (TS) of 100 Mega bit per second         (Mbps)
   constituted by a plurality of TS packets, such as #0,                                      #1....
25 The transmitting device 11                            splits the input stream into
   split           streams of N                (or a smaller number of) channels
   constituting the plurality of channels by using a CB
   technology, and transmits the split                               streams.
    [0028]
30                The splitter 21 receives the input stream.                          The
   splitter 21 receives the input                             stream supplied thereto,
   9810285_1 (GHMatters) P102691.AU.1

                                                     8
   and splits the received input stream into split streams
   of N (or a smaller number of) channels ch#1 through ch#N.
    [0029]
                  More specifically, the splitter 21 distributes the
 5 TS packets of the input stream to one of the N channels
   ch#1 through ch#N and null packets (NP) to all of the
   other channels, and repeats these distributions for the
   respective TS packets of the input stream to split the
   input stream into split streams of the N channels ch#1
10 through ch#N.
    [0030]
                  The splitter 21 supplies the split stream (packets
   of split stream) of the channel ch#n                       (nth channel) to the
   buffer 22,                    in   response to a request (packet request)
15 issued from the channel processing unit 23,.
    [0031]
                  The buffer 22,             is an FIFO (First In First Out),     for
   example, which sequentially stores the split stream
    (packets of split stream) of the channel ch#n received
20 from the splitter 21, and supplies the stored split
   stream of the channel ch#n to the channel processing unit
   23,.
    [0032]
                  The channel processing unit 23, processes the split
25 stream of the channel ch#n received from the buffer 22k,
   and transmits a channel stream s#n of the channel ch#n
   obtained by the processing.
    [0033]
                  The channel processing unit 23, includes a
30 synchronization unit 31,,                      a null packet  (NP)   deletion
   unit 32,, a forward error correction                      (FEC)    unit 33,, a
   9810285_1 (GHMatters) P102691.AU.1

                                              9
   frame generation unit 34,, and a modulation                 (MOD)   unit
   35k.
    [0034]
                  The synchronization unit 31, receives the split
 5 stream of the channel ch#n from the buffer 22,,                  and input
   stream time reference                (ISCR) from the time associated
   information generation unit 27,                for example.   This ISCR
   indicates transmission time of the packets, and
   corresponds to one of input stream synchronizer                    (ISSY)
10 specified in DVB-S2 and others as time associated
   information associated with transmission time of the
   packets.
    [0035]
                  The synchronization unit 31, adds ISCR, which has
15 been supplied from the time associated information
   generation unit 27 at the time of supply of the packets
   to the synchronization unit 31,,                to each end of the
   packets of the split stream of the channel ch#n received
   from the buffer 22,,               and supplies the resultant     split
20 stream to the NP deletion unit 32, as a post
   synchronization stream of the channel ch#n.
    [0036]
                  The NP deletion unit 32, deletes NPs from the post
   synchronization split stream of the channel ch#n (split
25 stream containing ISCR for each packet) received from the
   synchronization unit 31,,               and supplies the resultant
   split           stream to the FEC unit 33,      as an NP deletion stream
   of the channel ch#n.
    [0037]
30                After the NP deletion unit 32,       deletes NPs from the
   post-synchronization stream in the manner described above,
   9810285_1 (GHMatters) P102691.AU.1

                                                         10
   the resultant data rate of the NP deletion stream becomes
   lower than the data rate of the input                              stream by a volume
   of the deleted NPs.                        Accordingly, the transmission band
   for transmission of the NP deletion stream of one channel
 5 becomes narrower than the transmission band for
   transmission of the input                           stream.
    [0038]
                  The FEC unit              33, adds a base band        (BB)  header to
   one or more packets of the NP deletion stream of the
10 channel ch#n supplied from the NP deletion unit 32,, and
   further adds                       in-band signaling specified in DVB-T2 and
   others to the packet or packets as necessary to generate
   a stream of a BB frame specified in DVB-S2 and others,
   for example.
15  [0039]
                  The FEC unit              33, further      performs  error   correction
   encoding such as BCH encoding and LDPC encoding for a
   target of a BB frame.
    [0040]
20                The FEC unit              33, obtains an FEC frame         of the
   channel ch#n by error correction encoding for the BB
   frame, and maps the FEC frame in units of a symbol
   constituted by a predetermined number of bits to signal
   points on a constellation defined by a modulation system
25 of predetermined quadrature                            modulation.    The FEC unit     33,
   supplies a stream of the resultant FEC frame of the
   channel ch#n to the frame generation unit 34,.
    [0041]
                  The frame              generation     unit   34, generates   an
30 extension physical layer                          (PL) header of a PL frame of
   DVB-S2, for example.

                  This extension PL header contains an encoding rate

                  The MOD unit              35, performs     quadrature modulation     for

25 received from the frame generation unit 34,, and
   transmits resultant modulation signals in a transmission

    [0049]
                  Fig. 3 is a flowchart describing a process
    (transmitting process) performed by the transmitting
   device 11 in Fig. 2.
20  [0050]
                  In step S11, the splitter 21 distributes TS packets
   of an input                       stream supplied thereto to one channel of N
   channels ch#1 through ch#N, and distributes NPs to all of
   the other channels to split the input                               stream to split the
25 input           stream into split streams of the N channels ch#1
   through ch#N each of which contains a mixture of the TS
   packets of the input                          stream and NPs.       Then, the splitter
   21 supplies the split stream of the channel ch#n to the
   buffer 22,.
30  [0051]
                  The buffer 22,                sequentially    stores      the split      stream
   9810285_1 (GHMatters) P102691.AU.1

                                               13
   of the channel ch#n supplied from the splitter 21, and
   sequentially supplies the stored split stream of the
   channel ch#n to the channel processing unit 23,.                    Then,
   the process proceeds from step Sl                    to step S12.
 5  [0052]
                  In        step S12, the synchronization unit 31,   of the
   channel processing unit 23, adds ISCR received from the
   time associated information generation unit 27 to each
   end of packets of the split stream of the channel ch#n
10 received from the buffer 22,,                  and supplies the resultant
   split stream of the channel ch#n to the NP deletion unit
   32, as a post-synchronization stream of the channel ch#n.
   Then, the process proceeds to step S13.
    [0053]
15                In        step S13, the NP deletion unit 32,   deletes NPs
   from the post-synchronization stream of the channel ch#n
    (split stream containing ISCR added to each packet)
   received from the synchronization unit 31,, and supplies
   the resultant stream to the FEC unit 33, as an NP
20 deletion stream of the channel ch#n.                    Then, the process
   proceeds to step S14.
    [0054]
                  In        step S14, the FEC unit 33, adds a BB header to
   one or more packets of the NP deletion stream of the
25 channel ch#n supplied from the NP deletion unit 32,, and
   adds in-band signaling to these packets as necessary to
   generate a stream of a BB frame.
    [0055]
                  The FEC unit 33, performs         error correction encoding
30 for a target of the BB frame to obtain an FEC frame of
   the channel ch#n, and maps the FEC frame in units of a
   9810285_1 (GHMatters) P102691.AU.1

                                                      14
   symbol constituted by a predetermined number of bits to
   any one of                     signal points on a constellation defined by a
   modulation system of quadrature modulation.                           The FEC unit
   33, supplies the stream of the FEC frame of the channel
 5 ch#n after the mapping to the frame generation unit 34,.
   Then, the process proceeds from step S14 to step S15.
    [0056]
                  In step S15, the frame generation unit 34,
   generates an extension PL header containing MODCOD, TYPE,
10 and CB signaling.
    [0057]
                  The frame generation unit 34, adds the extension PL
   header to the FEC frame of the channel ch#n received from
   the FEC unit                       33, to generate   a stream of the extension PL
15 frame, and supplies the generated stream to the MOD unit
   35,.          Then, the process proceeds to step S16.
    [0058]
                  In        step S16,        the MOD unit   35, performs quadrature
   modulation for the stream of the extension PL frame of
20 the channel ch#n received from the frame generation unit
   34,, and transmits resultant modulation signals of the
   channel ch#n as a channel stream s#n of the channel ch#n
   to end the process.
    [0059]
25                Steps Sl               through S16 of the transmitting process
   in Fig. 3 are performed via a pipe line.
    [0060]
                  As described above, the transmitting device 11
   splits an input                        stream into split streams of the
30 plurality of N channels ch#1 through ch#N each of which
   contains a mixture of TS packets of the input                           stream and
   9810285_1 (GHMatters) P102691.AU.1

                                                     15
   NPs,         and deletes the NPs contained in the split streams
   of the respective channels ch#n to transmit NP deletion
   streams.
    [0061]
 5                In this case, the data rate of the NP deletion
   stream of each of the channels ch#n becomes lower than
   the data rate of the input                       stream by a volume of the
   deleted NPs.                       Accordingly, transmission of the high-data
   rate input                     stream is achievable via a plurality of
10 transmission paths each of which does not have a wide
   transmission band.
    [0062]
                  Moreover, a circuit constituting the FEC unit 33,
   need not have a high processing speed to perform error
15 correction encoding for a target of the NP deletion
   stream              (BB frame generated from NP deletion stream) of
   the channel ch#n.

    [0066]
                  The channel processing unit                 51,   receives  and

                  More specifically, the channel processing unit 51,
   includes a de-modulation                         (DMD)  unit 61,,   a header
   extraction unit 62,,                       an FEC unit 63,,     an NP insertion
 5 unit 64,,                  and a buffer 65,.
    [0068]
                  The DMD unit 61,               receives the channel stream s#n of
   the channel ch#n transmitted from the transmitting device
   11,        and demodulates the channel stream s#n of the channel
10 ch#n modulated by the MOD unit 35,                          in  Fig.  2.  Then,  the
   DMD unit                  61,      supplies a stream of an extension PL frame
   to the header extraction unit 62,                         as demodulation signals
   of the channel ch#n obtained by the demodulation.
    [0069]
15                The header extraction unit 62,                  extracts an
   extension PL header containing CB signaling and others
   from the extension PL frame                          (stream of extension PL
   frame)             received           from the DMD unit    61,,  and supplies the
   extracted extension PL header the control unit 53.
20  [0070]
                  The header extraction unit 62,                  further extracts a
   mapped FEC frame of the channel ch#n from the extension
   PL frame                  (stream of extension PL frame),           and supplies the
   extracted FEC frame to the FEC unit 63k.
25  [0071]
                  The FEC unit 63,               demaps the mapped FEC frame of the
   channel ch#n received from the header extraction unit 62,.
   The FEC unit 63, further decodes error correction                             codes
   of the demapped FEC frame of the channel ch#n performed
30 as error correction for error correction encoding by the

   supplies the restored NP deletion stream to the NP
   insertion                   unit       64,   as a post-reception             FEC stream of the
 5 channel ch#n.
    [0072]
                  The NP insertion                      unit  64,    supplies the post

   the FEC unit                       63,   to the buffer           65,,    and stores       the post
10 reception FEC stream in the buffer 65,.

                  Then,             the NP      insertion      unit       64, outputs the packets

                  By this              method,        the NP    insertion       unit     64,   restores

                  It        is assumed herein that the transmission system
   in Fig. 1 includes the five transmitting devices 11,                             for
   example, and that each of the five transmitting devices
   11      splits an input stream into split streams of two
15 channels to transmit channel streams                            s#1 and s#2  obtained
   from the split streams of the two channels.
    [0091]
                  It        is further assumed that the channel streams             s#1
   and s#2 of the two channels are generated from an input
20 stream different                         for each of the five transmitting
   devices 11,                      and transmitted in two transmission bands
   included in ten transmission bands and not overlapping
   with each other, for example.
    [0092]
25                In this case, the receiving device 12                   is difficult
   to determine which of input                            streams is reconstructed by a
   channel stream transmitted in any of the ten transmission
   bands when each of the channel streams does not                             contain
   CB signaling.
30  [0093]
                  Accordingly, the receiving device 12 is required to
   9810285_1 (GHMatters) P102691.AU.1

                                                   22
   determine whether or not a desired input                       stream (split
   streams of two channels constituting the input                       stream
    (channel streams obtained from the split                      streams)) has
   been received based on confirmation of reception of
 5 accurate service information                       (SI) after receiving channel
   streams of two channels and reconstructing a TS as an
   input           stream for each of          1OC2  =  45 possible combinations
   of two transmission bands                     selected from the ten
   transmission bands in order to obtain the desired input
10 stream, for example.
    [0094]
                  However, a considerable time is required for the
   receiving device 12 to obtain a desired input                       stream
   based on confirmation of reception of accurate SI when a
15 TS as an input stream is reconstructed from received
   channel streams                    for all of possible combinations of two
   transmission bands selected from the ten transmission
   bands.                This method is far from an appropriate stream
   processing method.
20  [0095]
                  According to the present technology, therefore, CB
   signaling specifying CB is inserted into the channel
   streams to identify split                     streams   (channel streams
   obtained from split                    streams) constituting an input stream,
25 and thereby perform appropriate processing without the
   need of reconstruction of a TS as an input                       stream.

15 streams                constituting each of input streams)                       are

                  On the transmitting device 11 side, the frame

                  On the receiving device 12                     side, the control unit

30                In other words, it is determined that CB is being

   than 0 and 0, respectively, and that CB is not being
   performed when the bit                so and si are set to 0 and 0,

10  [0158]
                  According to CB signaling in the third example, it

                  When CB is being performed, the control unit 53
   receives channel streams in a transmission band other
   than the transmission band containing channel streams
20 received by the channel processing unit 51,,                   and allows a
   channel processing unit 51,                 of a different channel ch#n'

 5                CB signalings in the second and third examples
   contain location information as well as signature
   information.                        In this case, it is identifiable, based on
   this location information, whether the transmission band
   for transmitting the different                                split streams constituting
10 the input stream together with the split                                    streams
    (obtained from channel streams) received by the channel

15 by the channel processing                             unit    51,.  Accordingly,      the
   channel processing unit                            51,     of the different      channel
   ch#n' is allowed to rapidly search for the different

   to the computer                       from a download site via a satellite for
   digital satellite service, or may be transferred to the
   computer by wire through a network such as a LAN                                   (Local
   Area Network) and the Internet.
20  [0176]
                  The computer includes a central processing unit
    (CPU) 102 to which an input/output interface 110 is
   connected via a bus 101.
    [0177]
25                When an instruction is input to the CPU 102                          from a
   user via the input/output interface                             110 by operation of
   an input unit 107 or by other methods, the CPU 102
   executes the programs stored in the read only memory
    (ROM)          103 in             response to the instruction.        Alternatively,
30 the CPU 102 loads the programs stored in the hard disk
   105 into a random access memory                          (PAM) 104 and executes
   9810285_1 (GHMatters) P102691.AU.1

                                                     38
   the loaded programs.
    [0178]
                  According to this structure, the CPU 102 executes
   processes shown in the foregoing flowcharts, or processes
 5 performed by using the structures illustrated in the
   foregoing block diagrams.                        The CPU 102 outputs the
   processing results from an output unit 106 via the
   input/output interface 110 or transmits the processing
   results from a communication unit 108, and records the
10 processing results in the hard disk 105 as necessary, for
   example,.
    [0179]
                  The input unit 107 is constituted by a keyboard, a
   mouse, a microphone or the like.                        The output unit 106 is
15 constituted by a liquid crystal display (LCD), a speaker
   or the like.
    [0180]
                  The processes in the present specification executed
   by the computer under the programs need not be performed
20 in time series in the order described in the flowcharts.
   Accordingly, the processes executed by the computer under
   the programs include processes executed in parallel or
   individually                       (such as parallel processes or processes by
   objects).
25  [0181]
                  The programs may be processed only by one computer
    (processor), or may be separately processed by a
   plurality of computers.                        In addition, the programs may be
   transferred to and executed by a remote computer.
30  [0182]
                  According to the present specification, the system
   9810285_1 (GHMatters) P102691.AU.1

                                                    39
   refers to a collection of plural constituent elements
    (such as devices and modules                      (parts)) . In this case, all
   of the constituent elements are not required to be
   included in                      an identical housing.   Accordingly, multiple
 5 devices accommodated in separate housings and connected
   via a network, and one device including multiple modules
   accommodated within one housing are both regarded as
   systems.
    [0183]
10                Embodiments of the present technology are not
   limited to the specific embodiment described herein.
   Various modifications and changes may be made without
   departing from the subject matters of the present
   technology.
15  [0184]
                  For example, the present technology may adopt a
   cloud computing structure where a plurality of devices
   share one function and perform the function in
   cooperation with each other via a network.
20  [0185]
                  The respective steps discussed with reference to
   the foregoing flowcharts may be shared and executed by
   multiple devices rather than executed by one device.
    [0186]
25                When multiple processes are contained in one step,
   the multiple processes contained in the one step may be
   shared and executed by multiple devices rather than
   executed by one device.
    [0187]
30                According to this embodiment, the input stream is
   constituted by a TS.                       However, the input stream may be a
   9810285_1 (GHMatters) P102691.AU.1

                                                  40
   stream constituted by a plurality of packets other than a
   TS.
    [0188]
                  According to this embodiment, NPs are inserted at
 5 the time of splitting of an input stream by the splitter
   21,        and then are deleted by the NP deletion unit 32,.
   However, the input stream may be split by the splitter 21
   without insertion of NPs.                     In this case, the NP deletion
   unit         32,        of the channel processing unit     23, may be
10 eliminated.
    [0189]
                  According to this embodiment, ISCR is added to each
   packet of a split stream by the synchronization unit 31,.
   However, ISCR may be added to only a packet of a part of
15 a     split            stream,     or need not be added to any packet.    When
   ISCR is not added to any packet, the synchronization unit
   31, of the channel processing unit                    23, may be eliminated.
    [0190]
                  According to this embodiment, an input stream is
20 split in units of a packet.                     However, an input stream may
   be split in other predetermined types of units, such as a
   BB frame, an FEC frame, and a physical layer pipe                      (PLP).
    [0191]
                  According to this embodiment, CB signaling is
25 inserted into an extension PL header of an extension PL
   frame after generation of the extension PL frame.
   However, CB signaling may be inserted into a header of a
   T2/C2           frame after construction of the T2/C2           frame.
   Alternatively, CB signaling may be inserted into a dummy
30 PL frame                  (Dummy PLFRAME) allowed to be transmitted in
   DVB-S2.

    [0192]
                  According to this embodiment, location information
   indicates whether a transmission band of different                  split
   streams                is higher or lower than a band of interest.
 5 However, location information may indicate more specific
   location of a transmission band of different split
   streams,                 such as x indicating a higher or lower
   transmission band than a band of interest by x,                 for
   example.
