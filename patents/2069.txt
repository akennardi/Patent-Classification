                                FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5 [0001]      The present invention relates to the field of moisture control. More
   particularly, the invention relates to inhibiting root growth. Most particularly, the
   invention relates to a system for inhibiting root growth.
                          BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
10 [0002]      Any reference to background art herein is not to be construed as an
   admission that such art constitutes common general knowledge in Australia or
   elsewhere.
   [0003]      Many urban structures such as commercial and residential buildings,
   concrete pathways and the like are located in contact with soil and are in close
15 proximity to plants. Certain types of plants, particularly trees, have vigorous root
   systems and, as the tree grows, these root systems tend to grow outwardly from
   the tree in search of water and nutrients.
   [0004]      This growth can have a devastating impact upon the integrity of these
   structures.    For example, roots that grow around underground pipe systems
20 exert pressure on the pipe and can cause the pipe to move and crack. This
   cracking results in the need for expensive and time consuming repair work
   whereby soil around the pipe must be excavated and the pipe either repaired or
   replaced.
   [0005]      Furthermore,    the area    underneath     a concrete   path   tends to
25 accumulate moisture as the concrete reduces evaporation from the soil. Tree
   roots often grow towards this moisture and become large due to the steady
   3453320vl

                                               2
   source of water. The growth of the roots can cause the soil under the concrete
   to dry and lose cohesiveness, which results in cracks propagating in the
   pathway. Cracks in pathways can result in a trip hazard for pedestrians. Again,
   expensive and time consuming repair work must be carried out to fix the defects.
 5 Furthermore, cracks in buildings are even more expensive and time consuming
   to repair.
   [0006]      It would be advantageous to provide a solution that alleviates the
   abovementioned problems, and/or provides the consumer with a useful or
   commercial alternative.

                             SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   [0007]      In one form, although it need not be the only or indeed the broadest
   form, the invention resides in a system for inhibiting root growth comprising a
   root barrier, and a plant root growth inhibitor formulation forming a seal between
15 at least part of the root barrier and at least part of a surrounding soil.
   [0008]      In an embodiment, the plant root growth              inhibitor formulation
   comprises an expansive clay and a salt.
   [0009]      In one embodiment, the expansive clay is selected from the group
   consisting of bentonite clay, montmorillonite clay, smectite clay, or a combination
20 of two or more thereof. The expansive clay may suitably be a bentonite clay.
   Preferably, the bentonite clay is sodium bentonite clay.
   [0010]      In a preferred embodiment, the salt is sodium chloride.
   [0011]      In an embodiment, the plant root growth              inhibitor formulation
   comprises between about 60-90% expansive clay and about 10-40% salt.
25 Suitably, the plant root growth inhibitor formulation comprises about 80%
   expansive clay and about 20% salt.

   [0012]      In a particularly preferred embodiment, the plant root growth inhibitor
   formulation comprises about 80% bentonite clay and about 20% salt.
   [0013]      In another form, the invention resides in a method of inhibiting root
   growth including the steps of:
 5             providing a trench;
               applying a plant root growth inhibitor formulation to at least part of a
               soil forming the trench; and
               placing a root barrier in contact with the root growth inhibitor
              formulation,
10            to thereby inhibit root growth.
   [0014]     The plant root growth inhibitor formulation and root barrier are as
   substantially described hereinabove.
   [0015]      In one embodiment, the plant root growth inhibitor is applied in a 3-5
   mm thick layer.
15 [0016]      Suitably, the plant root growth inhibitor formulation is applied at an
   application rate of 5-20 kg/M 2 . An application rate of 10 kg/M2 is particularly
   preferred.
   [0017]      In yet another form, the invention resides in a kit for inhibiting root
   growth comprising:
20             a root barrier; and
               a plant root growth inhibitor formulation that forms a seal between at
   least part of the root barrier and at least part of a surrounding soil.
   [0018]     The plant root growth inhibitor formulation and root barrier are as
   substantially described hereinabove.
25 [0019]     The various features and embodiments of the present invention
   referred to in the individual sections above and in the description which follows
   apply, as appropriate, to other sections, mutatis mutandis. Consequently
   features specified in one section may be combined with features specified in
   other sections as appropriate.

                          BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
 5 [0021]        To assist in understanding the invention and to enable a person
   skilled in the art to put the invention into practical effect, embodiments of the
   invention will be described by way of example only with reference to the
   accompanying drawings, in which:
                     FIG 1 shows a sectional view of an area having a plant, a structure
10           and a system for inhibiting root growth according to an embodiment of the
             invention; and
                     FIGs 2a-2g show different embodiments of the system for inhibiting
             root growth.
15                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   [0022]        Embodiments of the present invention reside primarily in a system for
   inhibiting root growth and moisture control. Accordingly, the system has been
   illustrated in concise schematic form in the drawings, showing only those specific
   details that are necessary for understanding the embodiments of the present
20 invention so as not to obscure the disclosure with excessive detail that will be
   readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the
   present description.
   [0023]        In this specification, adjectives such as upper and lower, and the like
   may be used solely to distinguish one element or action from another element or
25 action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or
   order. Words such as "comprises" or "includes" are intended to define a non
   exclusive inclusion, such that a method or system that comprises a list of
   elements does not include only those elements but may include other elements
   3453320vl

                                              5
   not expressly listed, including elements that are inherent to such a method or
   system.
   [0024]     As used herein, the term 'about' means the amount is nominally the
   number following the term 'about' but the actual amount may vary from this
 5 precise number to an unimportant degree.
   [0025]      Inhibition of the growth of plant roots is defined as an artificially
   generated situation where the roots of a plant do not grow as favorably due to a
   set of conditions, when compared to a situation without the conditions in place.
   As such, the plant roots may either not grow at all, or may only grow to a lesser
10 extent than would have occurred without the interference.
   [0026]      Root growth can have a devastating impact upon the integrity of urban
   structures. The areas underneath a concrete path or other structures tend to
   accumulate moisture due to the overlying structure preventing evaporation. As
   such, roots that reach this area can absorb the moisture therein and cause it to
15 dry out. Even the presence of roots in the soil adjacent to this area can lead to
   loss of moisture through matric suction. Matric suction is the pressure dry soil
   exerts on surrounding soil to equalize the moisture content. This absorption of
   water leads to the soil underneath becoming less cohesive and can cause the
   structures placed thereon to crack and destabilize. The closer the plant is to the
20 structure the greater the degree of matric suction exerted on the soil beneath the
   structure. As such, it would be advantageous to prevent moisture loss from these
   areas.
   [0027]      FIG 1 shows a sectional view of an area with a plant 400 in close
   proximity to a structure 100. As can be seen from FIG 1, the roots of the plant
25 400 extend radially from the tree in the search for water and nutrients. The roots
   of the plant 400 may eventually extend towards the area underneath the
   structure 100. Non-limiting examples of the structure include concrete or asphalt
   paths, footings or foundations of a building, tennis or other sporting courts, road
   kerbing and buildings.
30 [0028]      In order to inhibit the root growth of the plant 400 towards structure
   3453320vl

                                              6
   100, a system for inhibiting root growth comprising a root barrier 200, and a plant
   root growth inhibitor formulation 210 that forms a seal between at least part of
   the root barrier 200 and at least part of a surrounding soil 300 is placed
   therebetween.
 5 [0029]      In FIG 1, a seal of plant root inhibitor formulation 210 is formed at the
   lowest point of the root barrier 200 and the adjacent soil 300. However, it will be
   appreciated that the plant root inhibitor formulation 210 may extend along part of,
   or all of, the length and width of the root barrier 200. In one embodiment, the
   plant root inhibitor formulation 210 is, at least, present at the base of the trench
10 (mentioned in more detail hereinafter). In other words, the plant root inhibitor
   formulation 210 at least forms a small cap or seal between the base of the trench
   and the root barrier 200.
   [0030]      The root barrier 200 prevents moisture from being absorbed by roots
   and alleviates the problems associated with loss of moisture. As such, the root
15 barrier 200 prevents matric suction and can be formed of any waterproof
   material. Suitably, the root barrier 200 is formed of a waterproof polymer. More
   suitably, the root barrier 200 is formed of plastic. In an embodiment, the root
   barrier 200 is formed of polyethylene. Preferably, the root barrier 200 is formed
   of high-density polyethylene. It will be appreciated by the person skilled in the art
20 that two or more root barriers can be utilized in the current system to prevent
   loss of moisture and to inhibit the growth of roots. The root barrier 200 is
   maintained in place by filling the trench, in which the root barrier 200 is placed,
   with backfill 230, 250 or 280 (mentioned in more detail hereinafter).
   [0031]      The thickness of the root barrier 200 is suitably greater than about 0.1
25 mm, more suitably between about 0.1 mm and about 2 mm, preferably between
   about 0.5 mm and about 1 mm, more preferably between about 0.70 mm and
   about 0.80 mm, and most preferably about 0.75 mm, as determined by ASTM D
   5199.
   [0032]      The density of the root barrier 200 is suitably greater than about 0.94
30 g/cc as determined by ASTM D1 505. The yield strength of the root barrier 200 is
   3453320vl

                                             7
   suitably greater than about 11 N/mm width as determined by TYPE IV, 2 ipm.
   The yield elongation of the root barrier 200 is suitably greater than about 13% as
   determined by G.L. 1.3 in. (33mm).
   [0033]      The tear resistance (min. avg.) of the root barrier 200 is suitably
 5 greater than about 98N as determined by ASTM D 1004. The puncture
   resistance (min avg.) of the root barrier 200 is suitably greater than about 263N
   as determined by ASTM D 4833. The carbon black content of the root barrier
   200 is suitably between about 1-5%, or preferably between about 2-3%, as
   determined by ASTM D 1603. The nutch constant tensile load (min. avg.) of the
10 root barrier 200 is suitably about 400 hr. as determined by ASTM D 5297.
   [0034]      Preferably, the root barrier 200 is made of a flexible material. The
   break elongation of the root barrier 200 is suitably greater than about 700% as
   determined by G.L. 2.0 in. (51mm). As such, the root barrier 200 is able to
   withstand hydrostatic pressure resulting from moisture stabilization. In this
15 regard, during the dry season, reactive clay near the root barrier 200 may dry
   and shrink which leads to pressure being applied to the root barrier 200. In
   contrast, during the wet season, the reactive clay can absorb water and swell
   which also leads to pressure being applied to the root barrier 200. The high
   break elongation property of the root barrier 200 allows it to accommodate these
20 naturally occurring variations.
   [0035]      The plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210 comprises expansive
   clay and salt. A suitable plant root growth inhibitor formulation is described in
   Australian patent 2011200814 which is incorporated herein, in its entirety, by
   reference.    Expansive clay contains clay minerals having a high shrink-swell
25 capacity, including smectite clay, bentonite clay, and montmorillonite clay, or
   combinations thereof. Preferably the expansive clay is bentonite clay. Sodium
   bentonite clay is particularly preferred.
   [0036]      Expansive clay swells when wet, typically absorbing several times its
   dry mass in water, to form a 'sticky' solid mass having a low volume of interstitial
30 space in comparison to the soil 300.       As such, swelled expansive clay has a
   3453320vl

                                             8
   reduced volume of oxygen available to plant roots in comparison to the soil 300.
   The reduced availability of oxygen means that plant roots grow towards soil in
   preference to growing into the plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210.
   [0037]      The expansive clay is also hygroscopic and draws in moisture from
 5 the soil 300. As well as creating an area of low oxygen, the expansive clay is
   stable and is not highly mobile through the soil 300. Other components of the
   plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210 mixed with the expansive clay also
   become bound in a stable mass. The inventor postulates that this assists in
   preventing the plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210 from leaching into the
10 surrounding soil 300 which would dilute the activity of the formulation 210.
   [0038]      The pH of expansive clay such as sodium bentonite is usually in the
   range of about 8 to about 12, with variation occurring naturally dependent upon
   the source of the expansive clay. In particular, the pH of sodium bentonite is
   about 10. This pH is outside the pH range which is preferred by plants such as
15 trees, and so a second mechanism of action is provided for the inhibition of plant
   root growth.
   [0039]      The salt used is preferably sodium chloride. The presence of salt in
   the plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210 creates a saline environment
   which is not tolerated by many plants, thus providing a third mechanism of action
20 for the inhibition of plant root growth.    The salinity of the plant root growth
   inhibitor formulation 210 is about 35,000ppm, similar to that of seawater. It will
   be appreciated that other salts which form a saline environment which is not
   tolerated by plants may be utilized. Such salts include, but are not limited to,
   [0040]      The plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210 is prepared by mixing
25 the expansive clay and the salt together. Suitably, the plant root growth inhibitor
   formulation 210 comprises about 60-90% expansive clay and about 10-40% salt.
   An 80% bentonite clay and 20% salt composition is particularly preferred. Whilst
   expansive clays can be found in nature, the concentration of expansive clay in
   the plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210 is higher than that usually found in
30 most areas where plants grow.

                                                9
   [0041]      Systems that do not utilize a plant root growth inhibitor formulation
   210 may be breached by natural growth of the roots of a plant. The use of a
   plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210 inhibits the growth of the roots
   adjacent the root barrier 200, and alleviates the problem associated with the root
 5 barrier 200 being breached by growing roots.
   [0042]      Referring to FIG 1, the soil 300 in which the structure 100 is located
   upon contains a plant 400, having roots. As the plant 400 grows, the roots grow
   and seek out water and nutrients. However, as the roots of the plant 400 grow
   towards the plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210 they encounter an area of
10 reduced oxygen, high pH, and an unfavorable saline environment. Additionally,
   the presence of the root barrier 200 prevents water from being absorbed by the
   roots and does not encourage growth of the roots. The lack of available water
   also leads to an environment that that discourages the growth of roots. As such,
   the roots are less likely to penetrate through the root barrier 200 due to its
15 waterproof nature. The combination of these factors results in the roots either
   dying or growing in a different direction to obtain nutrients and water.
   [0043]      In another form, the invention resides in a method of inhibiting root
   growth including the steps of:
                          providing a trench;
20                        applying a plant root growth inhibitor formulation to at least
                          part of a soil forming the trench;
                          placing a root barrier in contact with the growth inhibitor
                          formulation;
              to thereby inhibit root growth.
25 [0044]     The plant root growth inhibitor formulation and root barrier are as
   described hereinabove.
   [0045]      In use, to inhibit plant growth, an area between a structure and a plant
   is excavated to provide a trench. The depth of the trench may be any suitable
   depth. The depth may suitably be selected depending on the plant and the
30 theoretical reach of their roots. The depth of the trench may suitably be greater
   3453320vl

                                                 10
   than about 0.5 m, more suitably between about 0.5 m to about 6 m, preferably
   between about 1 m to about 5 m, and most preferably between about 1.5 m and
   about 4 m. The root barrier may first be placed in a desired position in the trench,
   and the plant root growth            inhibitor formulation   is subsequently applied.
 5 Alternatively, the plant root growth inhibitor formulation may first be applied to
   the soil forming the trench and the root barrier subsequently placed into the
   trench. Preferably, the root barrier is placed such that about 50 mm of the root
   barrier is above the surface of the ground. The exposed root barrier allows for
   settlement of the system and may be subsequently trimmed. After the placement
10 of the root barrier and application of the formulation, the trench is backfilled. The
   trench may be backfilled with one or more components. For instance, the trench
   may be backfilled with one or more materials selected from the group consisting
   of gravel, soil, spoil, flowable fill and plant root growth inhibitor.
   [0046]      Shown in FIGS 2a-2g are other embodiments of the present system.
15 In FIG 2a, a layer of plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210 is present at the
   lower end of the root barrier 200 and trench, spoil backfill 230 is used to fill the
   trench. Additionally, the trench is sealed at the surface with a layer of concrete
   240. Shown in FIG 2b, a layer of plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210 is
   present at the lower end of the root barrier 200 and trench, a layer of spoil
20 backfill 230 is placed thereon, and the trench is filled with gravel 250. Shown in
   FIG 2c, the system is as described as for FIG 2a with the exception that the layer
   of concrete 240 is not present. Shown in FIG 2d, the system is as described for
   FIG 2a with the exception that the layer of concrete 240 has been replaced with
   further layer of plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210.
25 [0047]      FIG 2e shows a system that is as described for FIG 2c with the
   exception that a timber/plastic garden edge 260 is present at the top of the
   trench adjacent the root barrier 200. Shown in FIG 2f, the system is as described
   in FIG 2a with the exception that the trench and system were formed before a
   concrete path 270 was laid. As such, the system is substantially covered by the
30 concrete path 270. Shown in FIG 2g, a layer of plant root growth inhibitor
   formulation 210 is present at the lower end of the root barrier 200 and trench,
   3453320vl

                                               11
   and flowable fill 280 is used to fill the trench. A concrete foundation 290 for a
   structure is then formed substantially on top of the system. It will be appreciated
   that the system for inhibiting plant root growth can be placed between any
   existing structure and a plant. Alternatively, the system for inhibiting plant root
 5 growth can be formed before the structure is built, and the structure can be built
   thereon. As such, the structure may be formed on the system for inhibiting plant
   root growth.
   [0048]      The plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210 may suitably be of the
   thickness of 3-5mm. An application of plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210
10 at a thickness of 4mm is particularly suitable. The thickness of the plant root
   growth inhibitor formulation 210 results in an effective area that inhibits plant
   growth of about 50mm. An alternative application rate by weight is to apply plant
   root growth inhibitor formulation 210 at 5-20 kg/M 2 . An application of 10 kg/M 2
                                                                                      is
   particularly preferred.
15 [0049]      In one embodiment, the plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210 is
   mixed with water to form a slurry. The plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210
   is then applied to at least part of the soil forming the trench.
   [0050]      The plant root growth inhibitor formulation 210 is formulated from
   natural products and has a degree of salinity similar to that of sea water. It also
20 does not significantly leach from its position due to the use of expansive clay,
   and thus does not adversely affect the environment in which it is placed.
   Additionally, it does not create a safety hazard for an operator applying the plant
   root growth inhibitor formulation 210.
   [0051]      Use of the system may prevent the growth of tree or plant roots in
25 close proximity to the structure 100, and thus prevent subsequent damage to the
   structures.    Furthermore,   the    system     can  prevent   roots from  reaching
   underground pipes. The average life span of the structure 100 may thus be
   extended as the necessity for maintenance or replacement of the structure 100
   due to root damage is greatly reduced.
30 [0052]      It will be appreciated that the closer the trench is to the plant, the

   greater risk there is of damaging or destabilizing the tree. The inventors
   postulate that 50% of the distance from the drip line to the trunk of the plant is as
   close as the trench should be excavated without major risk to the health of the
   plant. The drip line is defined as the edge of the leaves (e.g. where the furthest
 5 drips of water from the leaves hit the ground).
   [0053]       Furthermore, the area required to sustain a healthy plant can be
   calculated by multiplying the radius of a mature plant canopy by 71 x r2 x 0.3m.
   The resultant number is the cubic volume of good soil required. If the ground
   surface area is not available then special pits filled with quality soil may assist in
10 this regard.
   [0054]       It will be appreciated that the system may be provided as a kit. In yet
   another form, the invention resides in a kit for inhibiting root growth comprising:
                a root barrier; and
                a plant root growth inhibitor formulation that forms a seal between at
15 least part of the root barrier and at least part of a surrounding soil.
   [0055]       The plant root growth inhibitor formulation and root barrier are as
   described hereinabove.
   [0056]       The above description of various embodiments of the present
   invention is provided for purposes of description to one of ordinary skill in the
20 related art. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to a single
   disclosed embodiment.          As mentioned above, numerous alternatives and
   variations to the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art of
   the above teaching.        Accordingly, while some alternative embodiments have
   been discussed specifically, other embodiments will be apparent or relatively
25 easily developed by those of ordinary skill in the art. Accordingly, this invention
   is intended to embrace all alternatives, modifications and variations of the
   present invention that have been discussed herein, and other embodiments that
