  029188 9689

[31]         The data interpretation controller 103 may perform optical character recognition for the
automated text recognition of various documents uploaded to the server 115 using the document
controller 106 such as by recognising text from a PDF document. The recognised text may be utilised
for indexing and searching the documents within the document data 107. Additionally, or
alternatively, the recognised text may be utilised by the data interpretation controller 103 for
interpreting the contents of the various documents of the document data 107.
[32]          For example, the data interpretation controller 103 may perform text recognition on a
document to interpret and expiry date associated therewith. As such, the data interpretation
controller 103 may store the alert in association with the document data 107 such that the alert
generator controller 104 may generate an alert at a particular time.
[33]          For example, a driver licence electronic document may be uploaded to the server 115 wherein
the data interpretation controller 103 performs OCR analysis thereon. The data interpretation
controller 103 analyses the expiry date of the driver's licence and updates the document data 107
with the expiry date meta data. Thereafter, the alert generator controller 104 periodically inspect the
expiry date meta data and, at the relevant time, sends an alert using the communication controller
105.
[34]         The client terminals 110 similarly comprise a processor 112 for processing digital data, also in
operable communication with a memory device. The client terminal 110 may similarly comprise a

for the purposes of communicating with the server 115. The processor 112 may interface with an 1/O
device 113 which may interface with an external storage medium 114, such as computer scanner, data
storage device or the like. In this way, document data may be read from the storage medium 114 to
the client terminal 110 and then uploaded to the server 115 across a computer data network 109.
[35]         The processor 112 is further in operable communication with an electronic display device 115
configured for the display of electronic data. The client terminal 112 is configured with computer
program code instructions to display a graphical user interface 116, including those illustrated in
Figures 2 - 7 described hereunder in further detail.
[36]         The client terminal 110 may take the form of a mobile communication device, personal
computer or the like. The client terminal 110 may securely authenticate with the server 115 via HTTPS
and preconfigured username/password combination. In this way, users may interact with the server
115 from the client terminal 110 and various other auxiliary devices 113.
[37]          Figure 2 illustrates an exemplary graphical user interface 200 of the client terminal 110. The
interface 200 comprises a menu of various options including for showing a dashboard 201, secure data

For the dashboard panel shown in Figure 2, the interface 200 may comprise a plurality of summary
panels showing various information including those which may be configured by the user.
[38]          Figure 3 illustrates a data panel interface 300 wherein the user may securely store various
field 301 and value 302 combinations. The fields and values of 302 may be stored in encrypted format
within the storage 102 of the server 115 and therefore typically used for sensitive data such as
passport details, contact information, and the like. The value 302 may take the form of string, Boolean,
numeric, date format or the like.
[39]          Figure 4 illustrates a document categorisation interface 400 wherein various documents may
be uploaded to the server 115 and categorised according to various categories 401. In the exemplary
interface 400, three document categories 401 are provided each which may be selected to expand the
assigned documents 402 therein. For each category 401, the user may upload, delete and edit various
documents.
[40]         As can be seen from the menu of the interface, different types of documents may be
categorised such as, for example, documents relating to professional qualifications, professional
development, educational documents and the like.
[41]          Figure 5 illustrates an exemplary communication interface 500 for the sending of electronic
communications.
[42]         The interface 500 comprises various input fields for composing electronic email messages,
including recipient 501, subject 502, attachment 503 and message fields 504.
[43]         The attachment field 503 may allow the user to select any of the various documents available
within the document data 107.
[44]          Figure 6 illustrates an exemplary attachment selection overlay 600 allowing for the quick
selection of appropriate documents. Specifically, whereas prior art communication software and
interfaces allow the user to open in explorer window to browse to an appropriate document, the
present interface allows the user to quickly drill down through various document in category
categorisations to select the appropriate documents.
[45]         Specifically, the exemplary attachment selection overlay 600 comprises a plurality of major
document categories 601 which, for example, may correspond to the aforedescribed document
categories of professional qualifications, professional development, educational documents and the
like.

[46]         Selection of one of the document categories 601 expands the various subcategories
thereunder. In the example provided, the first document category 601 comprises three subcategories
602.
[47]          Each of the subcategories 602 may be selected to reveal the various documents categorised
therein. For example, for the document category 601 relating to qualifications, the associated
subcategories 602 may comprise subcategories comprising qualifications, statements of attainment,
the certificate in training, associations, licenses/registrations, references and resumes.
[48]          In embodiments, the system 100 may allow the user to add, delete and edit the document
category 601 and the subcategories 602.
[49]         As can be appreciated, using the attachment selection overlay 600 when sending
communications using the communication interface 500 allows the user to quickly locate and find one
or more documents for attachment in a way that is generally faster than using conventional explorer
browsers and more suited for small form factor and/or responsive interfaces.
[50]          Figure 7 illustrates an example timeline interface 700 wherein various documents are shown
in chronological order at various dates 701 along a vertical timeline. In this way, the user is able to
vertically scroll through the timeline interface 700 so as to be able to quickly locate and select various
documents according to age.
[51]         An alerts interface (not shown) may allow the user to configure various alerts in relation to
the documents of the document data 107. As alluded to above, the system 100 may send alerts in
relation to document expiry events, such as, for example, drivers licence expiry events.
[52]          In embodiments the user may configure the alerts to send periodic alerts, such as those
relating to professional development periods.
