DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0040]    In figure 1, reference numeral 10 generally indicates a first embodiment of a
weighted support assembly. The support assembly 10 is suitable for supporting
structural components, such as hoarding panels 11 to form a temporary structure 13,
as shown in figure 3.
[0041]    The support assembly 10 includes a fastening assembly in the form of a
strap or tie 12 that is received around a stack of weights 14 to fasten the weights
together. The weights 14 can have any shape. In this example, the weights 14 are
rectangular. The tie 12 extends over major sides of the weights 14. However, the tie
12 can also extend over minor sides of the weights 14. In another arrangement, one
tie can extend over major sides of the weights 14 and another tie can extend over
minor sides of the weights 14. Furthermore, the tie 12 need not be received around
the entire stack of weights 14. There might also just be one weight 14 in the stack.
[0042]    In this embodiment, the weights 14 are positioned directly on a substrate,
such as a floor. Each weight 14 defines an opening 15 at one end 17 of the weight
14. Thus, the stack of weights 14 defines an elongate passage in which a post 22
can be received and retained against operatively horizontal displacement relative to
the weights 14. Each opening 15 can be slotted so that access to the opening 15 can
be achieved from the end 17. Thus, the elongate passage is in the form of a channel
that extends down one side of the stack of weights 14. The openings 15 can be
defined at major or minor sides of the weights 14. Furthermore, each weight 14 can
include two opposed openings 15.

                                              6
[0043]    The openings 15 can be configured so that the post 22 is retained in the
openings 15 against operatively horizontal or sideways movement of the post 22
relative to the weights 14. For example, the openings 15 can be shaped to retain the
post 22 in position. Alternatively, retaining members (not shown) can be arranged on
the weights 14 to retain the post 22 in the openings 15 against such horizontal or
sideways movement.
[0044]    In this embodiment, the post 22 is configured so that components, such as
the hoarding panels 11, can be fastened to the post 22 to form the temporary
structure 13.
[0045]    The weights 14 can be of any shape. For example, the weights 14 can be
sourced from an area or environment in which the support assembly 10 is used. The
weights 14 could include nesting formations to permit the weights 14 to nest relative
to each other when stacked.
[0046]    The support assembly 10 includes a fastening means in the form of a
tightening mechanism operable on the tie 12 to tighten the tie 12. The tightening
mechanism can be in the form of a ratchet tie down mechanism 36 and the tie 12 can
be in the form of a length of webbing that is engaged with the tie down mechanism
36 that can be used to strap the weights 14 together. It is envisaged that the
tightening mechanism can be in other forms. Any mechanism that can serve to
tighten the tie 12 may be suitable.
[0047]    The support assembly 10 includes a retaining means in the form of a
receiver 37 that is arranged on the stack of weights 14. In this embodiment, the
receiver is in the form of rectangular tube section 38 through which the tie 12 is
threaded. Thus, when the tie 12 is tightened, the tube section 38 is retained in
position on the weights 14. The tube section 38 defines an aperture plate 40
positioned proud of the tie 12. The aperture plate 40 defines an aperture 41 to
receive a lower end 42 of a brace 44. Thus, when the tie 12 is tightened, the lower
end 42 of the brace 44 is inhibited from lateral movement away from the post 22.
[0048]    The rectangular tube section 38 can be in the form of a retaining member
that is fastened to the lower end 42 of the brace 44. This can be achieved by
welding, for example. In that embodiment, the tube section 38 is not a receiver but
rather forms part of the brace 44.

                                              7
[0049]    The receiver 37 can take various forms. For example, the receiver 37 can be
a recessed formation, such as a blind hole, to receive the lower end 42 of the brace
44. Thus, instead of the aperture 41, the tube section 38 could define a recess or
socket for receiving the lower end 42 of the brace 44. The minimum requirement is
that the lower end 42 of the brace 44 is inhibited from lateral movement away from
the post 22. The lower end 42 can be welded into the recess or socket.
[0050]    In other embodiments, the lower end 42 of the brace 44 can be fastened, for
example by welding, to the rectangular tube section 38, without the need for an
aperture plate. It will readily be appreciated that the tube section can be cylindrical or
square, depending on availability of product.
[0051]    It is envisaged that the retaining means can be adapted for use with two
lower lengths of the bracing member. Thus, the retaining means can include two
receivers or two retaining members.
[0052]    An upper end 46 of the brace 44 is fastenable to the post 22. To that end, a
fastening or fixing plate 48 is arranged on the upper end 46, which can be fastened
to the post 22 with screws or similar fasteners. Thus, with the lower end 42 of the
brace 44 in the receiver 37, or fastened to the tube section 38, and the fixing plate 48
fastened to the post 22, the post 22 is further supported in an operatively vertical
position against, for example, wind load and other forces.
[0053]    In use, the tie 12, with the ratchet mechanism 36 at one end and the tube
section 38 threaded onto the tie 12, can be laid down on the foot 16. The weights 14
can then be stacked on to the foot 16. The tie 12 can then be strapped onto the
weights 14 with the tube section 38 in an appropriate position to receive the lower
end 42 of the brace 44. Then, the post 22 can be positioned in the openings 15 such
that the post 22 is supported in the operatively vertical position.
[0054]    The plate 48 can then be fastened to the post 22 after the lower end 42 has
been inserted through the aperture plate 40. Alternatively, the post 22 with the brace
44 attached to the post 22 can be inserted into the openings 15 with the lower end 42
being received through the aperture plate 40 at the same time. When the aperture
plate 40 is welded to the lower end 42, the lower end 42 can be positioned on the
stack of weights 14 and the tie 12 tightened.

                                              8
[0055]     In figure 3, reference numeral 50 generally indicates a second embodiment
of a weighted support assembly. With reference to the preceding drawings, like
reference numerals refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.
[0056]     Figure 3 also shows the hoarding panels 11 and the structural assembly 13
erected or built with the support assembly 50. It will readily be appreciated that other
forms of structure can be erected with the support assembly 50.
[0057]     In this embodiment, the tie 12 extends over the minor sides of the weights
14.
[0058]     The support assembly 50 includes a retaining means in the form of an
elongate tab 52 that can be received between the tie 12 and an uppermost weight 14
so that the tab 52 is retained in position when the tie 12 is tightened, as described
above. The elongate tab 52 is shaped to define the aperture plate 40. As above, the
elongate tab 52 can be a retaining member that is welded or otherwise fastened to
the lower end 42 of the brace 44.
[0059]     In this embodiment, the aperture plate 40 is defined by a U-shaped portion
51 that is oriented so that the aperture plate 40 is proud of an upper surface of the
uppermost weight 14. This allows the lower end 42 of the brace 44 to extend through
the aperture plate 40. In other embodiments, the U-shaped portion 51 is shaped to fit
over a nesting formation of the uppermost weight 14. Still further, the U-shaped
portion 51 can be shaped to fit over some other protruding formation of the
uppermost weight 14.
[0060]     In figure 5, reference numeral 60 generally indicates a third embodiment of a
support assembly. With reference to the preceding drawings, like reference numerals
refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.
[0061]     In this embodiment, a strap or tie 62 extends, operatively horizontally,
around the stack of weights 14 and the support member 18 to secure the weights 14
to the post 22. The tie 12 interconnects lengths of the tie 62 on opposite sides of the
stack of weights 14.
[0062]     In figure 7, reference numeral 70 generally indicates a fourth embodiment of
a support assembly. With reference to the preceding claims, like reference numerals
refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.

                                             9
[0063]    The support assembly 70 includes a fastening assembly in the form of a
clamp assembly 72 that is configured to clamp the weights 14 together.
[0064]    The clamp assembly 72 includes two clamp members 74 that are linearly
adjustable relative to each other to bring the clamp members 74 into and out of
operative engagement with the weights 14. The clamp assembly 72 includes a
locking mechanism 76 to lock the clamp members 74 together when they are in
operative engagement with the weights 14.
[0065]    The clamp assembly 72 can take various forms. In this case, the clamp
members 74 each have a clamp arm 78 and a slide member 80 that extends
generally orthogonally with respect to the associated clamp arm 78. The slide
members 80 overlap and extend through a rectangular tube section 82 so that they
can slide relative to each other through the tube section 82. A fastener 84 is threaded
through a wall of the tube section 82 to engage the slide members 80 to lock the
slide members 80 together or to release the slide members 80, allowing them to slide
relative to each other to release the weights or to allow the clamp members to be
urged together.
[0066]    In use, the weights 14 can be stacked on a foot, or on a substrate, as
mentioned above. A lower clamp arm 78 can be positioned underneath the weights
14 and an upper clamp arm 78 can be positioned on the weights 14 with the slide
members received through the rectangular tube section 82. The clamp members 74
can then be urged together and the fastener 84 manipulated to clamp the slide
members 80 together.
[0067]    The upper clamp arm 78 defines an aperture 86 to receive the lower end 42
of the brace 44. Thus, once the slide members 80 are locked together, the brace 44
can be positioned and fastened as set out above. The lower end 42 of the brace 44
can be welded to the upper clamp arm 78. The aperture 86 is thus useful for
strength. However, it is envisaged that, with welding, the aperture may be optional.
[0068]    In various embodiments, not shown, the upper clamp arm 78 can be shaped
so that it can hook over a nesting formation or other protruding formation of the
uppermost weight 14. Thus, a lug or lip could extend from the clamp arm 78 and
terminate the clamp members 74. The lug or lip would be generally parallel to the
associated slide member 80 so that the clamp arm 78 and lip engage the nesting
formation or some other protruding formation of the weight 14.

                                              10
[0069]     It is envisaged that various other forms of clamping mechanisms can be
used. For example, the two clamp members 74 can be displaced relative to each
other with an over-centre mechanism engaged with the clamp members 74 to clamp
the weights 14 together.
[0070]     In figure 9, reference numeral 90 generally indicates a fifth embodiment of a
support assembly. With reference to the preceding drawings, like reference numerals
refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.
[0071]     The support assembly 90 is suited for use with weights 14 that define at
least one opening 92, which is shown in the preceding drawings.
[0072]     In this embodiment, a stop plate 94 is arranged on the brace 44 towards the
lower end 42 of the brace 44 such that a section of the brace 44 can extend from the
stop plate 94 to terminate at the lower end 42. The stop plate 94 is dimensioned so
that the section of the brace 44 can extend through aligned openings 92 with the stop
plate 94 bearing against an uppermost weight 14. It will be appreciated that when the
brace 44 is secured to the support member 18, the brace 44 serves to retain the
weights 14 on the foot 16.
[0073]     In figure 11, reference numeral 100 generally indicates a sixth embodiment
of a support assembly. With reference to the preceding drawings, like reference
numerals refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.
[0074]     As with the support assembly 90, the support assembly 100 is suited for use
with weights 14 that define the opening 92.
[0075]     In this example, a locking post 102 is mounted or arranged on the foot 16
and extends upwardly from the foot 16 to be received through aligned openings 92.
An upper end 104 of the locking post 92 and the lower end 42 of the brace 44 are
configured so that they can be releasably fastened together. For example, the upper
end 104 of the locking post 92 and the lower end 42 of the brace can have
complementary lugs 106 that can be fastened together with a suitable fastener such
as a nut and bolt arrangement. Thus, when the brace 44 is fastened to the support
member 18, and the lugs 106 are fastened together, the weights 14 are effectively
locked together.
[0076]     In figure 13, reference numeral 110 generally indicates an eighth
embodiment of a support assembly. With reference to the preceding drawings, like
reference numerals refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.

                                            11
[0077]    The support assembly 110 includes a foot 16 on which the stack of weights
 14 is positioned. A post retainer 20 is mounted on one end of the foot 16. The post
retainer 20 is configured so that the post 22 can be inserted into the retainer 20 such
that the post 22 is effectively supported in the operatively vertical condition by the
weights 14 carried on the foot 16.
[0078]    The retaining means is in the form of a projection or projecting formation or
member 112 arranged on the strap or tie 12 to be received in the lower end 42 of the
brace 44. Alternatively, the projecting member 112 can define a receptacle or recess
in which the lower end 42 of the brace 44 can be received. In various embodiments,
the projecting member 112 can be fastened to the lower end 42 of the brace 44, for
example, by welding.
[0079]    The projecting member 112 can replace the tube section 38 or the elongate
tab 52, particularly when it is welded to the lower end 42 of the brace 44. In that
case, it's minimum requirement is that it defines some form of formation or extension
that allows it to be secured to the stack of weights 14 with the tie 12 or the clamp
member 74, or any other mechanism that can be secured to the weights 14. The
fastening of the lower end 42 of the brace 44 to either of the projecting member 112,
tube section 38 or elongate tab 52 further inhibits upward movement of the brace 44.
[0080]    In figure 15, reference numeral 113 generally indicates a ninth embodiment
of a weighted support assembly. With reference to the preceding drawings, like
reference numerals refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.
[0081]    The weighted support assembly 113 includes a brace 115. The brace 115 is
shaped to extend from a position in which it is fastened to the post 22, as described
above, downwardly and along a side of the stack of weights 14.
[0082]    The brace 115 has a lower portion 114 and an upper portion 116. The upper
portion 116 extends away from the post 22 to an extent that corresponds with a
position intermediate front and rear sides of the stack of weights 14 and then extends
generally vertically downwards. It will be appreciated that the upper portion 116 can
also extend angularly downwards to the position intermediate the front and rear sides
of the stack of weights 14. The lower portion 114 then extends sideways, if an
assumption is made that the post 22 is in a forward position, and then downwardly
past the side of the stack of weights 14. To that end, the lower portion 114 includes
an angled intermediate portion 118 that is interposed between a generally vertical leg
 120 that extends from the intermediate portion 118 and an end of the upper portion

                                            12
 116. The angled portion 118 extends sufficiently sideways to permit the leg 120 to be
positioned proximate or in abutment with one side of the stack of weights 14.
[0083]    The leg 120 can simply bear against a substrate. Alternatively, a foot 122
can be arranged on the leg 122 to bear against the substrate. In one embodiment,
the foot 122 can be received underneath the stack of weights 14.
[0084]    A securing means is arranged on the brace 112. For example, the securing
means is a clamp arm 124 that is adjustably mounted on the leg 120 with a suitable
adjustment means. The adjustment means is configured to allow a height of the
clamp arm 124 to be adjusted and the clamp arm 124 to be secured in that adjusted
position.
[0085]    The adjustment means includes a sleeve 126 mounted on one end of the
clamp arm 124, with the clamp arm 124 extending over the stack of weights 14. The
vertical leg 120 is received through the sleeve 126. The adjustment means includes a
fastening mechanism engaged with the sleeve 126 and operable to fasten the sleeve
 126, in a releasable manner, to the vertical leg 120. The fastening mechanism
includes a fastener 128 that is threaded through the sleeve 126 to bear against the
leg 120 to secure the sleeve 126 to the leg 120. The fastener 128 includes a handle
 130 so that the fastener 128 can be manipulated to allow a height of the clamp arm
 124 to be adjusted in a secure manner. Thus, the clamp arm 124 can be positioned
in an operative condition, as shown in figure 15, to bear against the stack of weights
 14. When the foot 122 is positioned underneath the stack of weights 14, the clamp
arm 124 and the foot 122 define a clamping means so that the weights 14 can be
securely clamped between the foot 122 and the clamp arm 124.
[0086]    In use, the post 22 can be engaged with the stack of weights 14 in the
manner described above. Then the brace 115 can be positioned with the foot 122
underneath the stack of weights 14 and the clamp arm 124 in a raised, inoperative
condition. The clamp arm 124 can then be lowered into the operative condition so
that the weights 14 are clamped between the foot 122 and the clamp arm 124. This
serves to further support the post 22 with the brace 115 effectively secured in
position with the weights 14.
[0087]    In figure 16, reference numeral 140 generally indicates a tenth embodiment
of a weighted support assembly. With reference to the preceding drawings, like
reference numerals refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.

                                            13
[0088]    In this embodiment, the lower portion 114 is bifurcated to define two of the
intermediate portions 118.1 and 118.2 and two of the legs 120.1 and 120.2. The foot
 122 can be mounted or arranged on the leg 120.1. A similar foot can also be
arranged on the leg 120.2. The clamp arm 124 is arranged on the vertical leg 120.1,
in the manner described above. A further clamp arm could also be arranged on the
vertical leg 120.2, if desired.
[0089]    In figure 17, reference numeral 150 generally indicates an eleventh
embodiment of a weighted support assembly. With reference to the preceding
drawings, like reference numerals refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.
[0090]    The weighted support assembly 150 includes a brace 152 that is shaped to
extend from a position in which it is fastened to the post 22, as described above,
downwardly and along a rear of the stack of weights 14.
[0091]    The support assemblies described herein are useful in the sense that they
can make use of weights having a generic shape. This may be useful in those
working environments in which structural elements such as concrete slabs are readily
available. Also, counterweights are often used in other applications and may be
useful to use with the support assemblies described herein without the need for an
orientation of the openings or even openings at all.
[0092]    In the various embodiments described herein, it will be appreciated that the
components are not necessarily in a unitary or assembled configuration. Thus, it is
envisaged that the components can be supplied in the form of a kit for use with
existing posts 22 and generic weights 14. In other embodiments, the post 22 can be
fastened to the stack of weights 14 in various ways that do not require an opening
slot at one end of each weight 14. For example, the post 22 could be strapped or
otherwise fastened to the weights 14. In another example, the post 22 could be
positioned in a post retainer that is clamped to the weights as is the brace, as
described above. Alternatively, the post retainer could be arranged or mounted on a
foot that extends underneath the weights 14 so that the post retainer is supported in
a generally vertical orientation.
[0093]    The use of common reference numerals is not intended to limit the scope of
the appended claims. Furthermore, the various components of the respective
embodiments described above can be interchanged, where reasonable and/or
appropriate, depending on the application.

                                              14
[0094]     The appended claims are to be considered as incorporated into the above
description.
[0095]     It is to be understood that the terminology employed above is for description
and should not be regarded as limiting. The described embodiments are intended to
be illustrative of the invention, without limiting the scope thereof. The invention is
capable of being practised with various modifications and additions as will readily
occur to those skilled in the art.
[0096]     Words indicating direction or orientation, such as "front", "rear", "back",
'vertical", etc., are used for convenience. The inventor(s) envisages that various
embodiments can be used in a non-operative configuration, such as when presented
for sale. Thus, such words are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as
restrictive.
