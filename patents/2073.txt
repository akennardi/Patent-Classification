                                 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Related Application
[0001]      This application is a divisional application of Australian Application No.
2014250865, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
Field of the Invention
[0002]      The present disclosure relates to a brake disc for a rotating member, such as a
wheel, and, more specifically, to an annular brake disc formed from a plurality of
interconnected brake disc segments.
Description of Related Art
[0003]      Brake discs are affixed to wheels for the purpose of providing a smooth, hard
contact surface that can be contacted by a brake shoe or pad controlled by a brake
mechanism, such as a brake jaw.           When contact between the disc and shoe or pad is
established, friction between the elements is sufficient to reduce or entirely inhibit rotation of
the wheel.      Disc brakes are commonly used in a variety of applications including, for
example, industrial machines, such as cranes and lifts, as well as in conveying installations,
such as escalators, elevators, ski-lifts, and the like. Disc brake assemblies are also employed
in transport vehicles, such as rail cars, public transportation vehicles, trucks, and automobiles.
[0004]      It is known that significant heat is created as a result of the frictional contact
between the brake shoe and brake disc. The heat may cause thermal expansion of portions of
the brake assembly and may cause the brake assembly to deform or degrade following
prolonged use. More particularly, known braking apparatus often do not permit uniform
distribution of the generated heat leading to wide temperature gradients across the braking
assembly. Such temperature gradients may cause fissures and cracks to form in the brake
disc. Additionally, cooling air flow is often neither uniform nor adequate to counteract the
destructive effects of the heat being generated.       Instead, cooling air may actually increase
temperature gradients on the brake disc, worsening thermal transitional phenomena.
Additionally, a considerable amount of the heat created on the contact surface of the brake
element is transferred to the shaft on which the brake disc is mounted. This transferred heat
may cause oxidation to occur on the shaft and/or wheel making replacing brake elements
more difficult. Prolonged heat exposure also alters the centering or calibration of the brake
elements and/or drive members, further affecting performance of the brake system and wheel.
9653666_1 (GHMatters) P101301.AU.1                  1

[0005]      To make the brake linings and/or brake discs more accessible and to simplify
maintenance, brake discs have been developed that are formed from two or more interlocking
segments or friction rings, which can be individually removed and replaced. For example,
U.S. Patent No. 4,132,294 to Poli, incorporated herein by reference, discloses a disc brake
including two or more linings disposed about a central hub. The outer sides of the linings are
configured to be contacted by a brake shoe and function in the conventional manner. The
inner side of the lining includes a plurality of radial cooling ribs for dissipating heat. The
disc brake is connected to a disc brake positioned on the opposite side of the wheel or to the
wheel itself by a fastener or screw inserted through a hole in the lining. The disc brake is
configured to affix to the wheel such that the inner surface of the lining is in contact with a
surface of the wheel.
[0006]      Other segmented disc brakes are known in which individual segments are spaced
apart by a gap to permit the segments to expand when exposed to heat. For example, U.S.
Patent No. 5,788,026 to Poli, incorporated herein by reference, discloses a disc brake having
a number of brake disc segments affixed to a rotating body to form an annular ring.
Corresponding segments of disc brakes are attached to one another by fasteners extending
through holes in the segments and rotating body. The segments are also slidably connected to
adjacent segments in the annular disc brake by joining elements or pins extending from a
socket of a segment to a corresponding socket of the adjacent segment. In this way, the
segments may move and expand in response to heat, friction, and pressure caused by contact
between the disc brake and brake mechanism.
[0007]      However, in such braking systems the segments are free to move as pressure is
applied. For example, increased pressure may push the segments in the circumferential or
radial direction relative to the wheel hub causing the segment to become poorly aligned with
the brake shoe. Thus, when the brake shoe contacts the misaligned segment, the segment
may be bent or damaged. The segment may also wear in an unanticipated pattern, which
further increases failure rates.      The misaligned segment may also rub against the wheel
surface causing a screeching sound or other undesirable noise.
                                   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0008]      In a first aspect the invention provides an arcuate brake segment of a brake disc, the
segment comprising: an inner side configured to contact a surface of a wheel; an outer side
comprising a braking surface configured to be contacted by a braking mechanism to apply a
braking force to the wheel; radial and circumferential edges extending between the inner side
9653666_1 (GHMatters) P101301.AU.1                  2

and the outer side of the segment; and a groove extending inwardly from the inner side of the
segment configured to receive a head portion of a coupling member to form a pivot joint in
which the segment is permitted to pivot about the head portion of the coupling member
 [0009]     In view of the foregoing, the rotating body and brake assembly of the present
disclosure is a segmented brake disc that is less susceptible to damage caused by thermal
expansion. Furthermore, while the brake disc is permitted to expand, movement of individual
segments in the circumferential and radial directions is restricted to help prevent a brake shoe
from contacting misaligned segments. As a result of such modifications, the provided brake
disc assembly is less susceptible to wear-based damage.           The brake disc assembly may
operate more quietly than known alternative systems.
 [0010]     Generally, this disclosure is directed to a brake assembly and rotating body that
addresses or overcomes some or all of the deficiencies and drawbacks associated with
existing braking systems. In one embodiment there is provided, a brake disc comprising: a
plurality of arcuate segments arranged to form a ring and a plurality of joining elements for
connecting the segments to adjacent segments, wherein each segment comprises: an inner
side configured to contact a surface of a wheel; an outer side comprising a braking surface for
contacting a braking mechanism; at least one socket on each radial end of the segment for
receiving one of the plurality of joining elements; and a groove on the inner side of the
segment configured to receive a head portion of a coupling member to form a pivot joint
between the adjacent segments for positioning the segment on the surface of the wheel.
 [0011]     In certain embodiments, the coupling member may include a head configured for
insertion in the segment groove.        In that case, the pivot joint may be a condyloid joint.
Alternatively, the pivot joint is a ball and socket joint.
 [0012]     In certain further embodiments, the disc may include a plurality of transverse
through holes extending between the inner side and the outer side of the segment configured
to receive fasteners to connect the segment to the wheel. Additionally, each segment may
include two sockets on each radial end of the segment. In that case, each of the plurality of
joining elements may be slidably received within a respective socket. Furthermore, a depth
of each socket may be greater than a length of the joining elements, thereby allowing the
joining element to slide entirely into the socket.
 [0013]     In certain embodiments, the disc may include six segments and adjacent segments
are separated by a radial gap. The segments may be movable, with respect to the joining
elements, to expand or reduce a width of the gap. The segment may include at least one
protrusion extending from the inner side of the segment for directing cooling air to the inner
9653666_1 (GHMatters) P101301.AU.1                  3

side of the segment. The protrusions may include radial fins extending between an inner
circumferential side and an outer circumferential side of the segment.
[0014]      According to another embodiment a brake assembly is provided.             The brake
assembly comprises: a wheel having a central hub, an outer rim, and a body extending
between the hub and the rim, the body having a front side surface and a rear side surface; a
front brake disc connected to the front side surface of the body; a rear brake disc connected to
the rear side surface of the body; and a plurality of coupling members extending between the
front brake disc and the rear brake disc, each coupling member comprising a head portion at
each longitudinal end thereof, wherein each brake disc comprises a plurality of arcuate
segments arranged to form a ring and a plurality of joining elements for connecting the
segments to adjacent segments and wherein each segment comprises: an inner side
configured to contact the front side surface or rear side surface of the body of the wheel; an
outer side comprising a braking surface for contacting a braking mechanism; at least one
socket located on each radial end of the segment for receiving the joining element; and a
groove on the inner side of the segment configured to receive the head portion of one of the
plurality of coupling members to form a pivot joint between adjacent segments for
positioning the segment on the front side surface or the rear side surface of the wheel.
[0015]      In certain embodiments, the coupling member may comprise a head on each
longitudinal end thereof and a shaft extending therebetween.         A groove of at least one
segment may define an ellipsoid cavity configured to receive the head of the coupling
member to form a condyloid joint. Alternatively, the groove may define a partially spherical
cavity configured to receive the head of the coupling member to form a ball and socket joint.
In certain embodiments, the coupling member extends through a hole in the body of the
wheel, such that one end of the coupling member is inserted in a groove of a segment of the
front brake disc and the other end of the coupling member is inserted in a groove of a
segment of the rear brake disc.
[0016]      In certain embodiments, each segment may further include at least one transverse
through hole extending between the inner side and the outer side of the segment. In that case,
the assembly may also include a fastener inserted through each through hole for connecting
the front brake disc to the rear brake disc through a corresponding through hole in the body of
the wheel. In certain embodiments, each segment may include two transverse through holes
located on a center axis of the segment.
[0017]      The foregoing and other features and characteristics, as well as the methods of
operation and functions of the related elements of structures and the combination of parts and

[0027]      However, it is to be understood that the invention may assume various alternative
variations and step sequences, except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to
be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and
described in the following specification, are simply exemplary embodiments of the invention.
Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics related to the embodiments
disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting.          For the purpose of facilitating
understanding of the invention, the accompanying drawings and description illustrate
preferred embodiments thereof, from which the invention, various embodiments of its
structures, construction and method of operation, and many advantages may be understood
and appreciated.
[0028]      The present disclosure is directed to a rotating body and brake disc. The rotating
body may be any wheel structure, including a railway vehicle wheel, a wheel for a truck or
automobile, or a wheel for various industrial machines. A brake disc refers to a structure
adapted to connect to the surface of one or both sides of the rotating body. The brake disc is
configured to be contacted by a braking mechanism, such as a brake jaw, brake pad, or brake
shoe. Friction between the brake disc and shoe inhibits rotation of the rotating body.
[0029]      With reference to FIG. 1, a rotating body, such as railway wheel 10 is shown in
accordance with one embodiment. The wheel 10 includes a body 12 extending between a
hub 14 and outer rim 16. The body 12 includes a front side surface 18 and a rear side surface
20 (shown in FIGS. 4A, 5, and 6). The outer rim 16 may include a tread 22, configured to
engage a rail (not shown). The body 12 may include regions having different thicknesses or
rigidity. For example, the body 12 may include alternating concentric bands (not shown)
having high and low rigidity. The rigidity of the various regions may result from varying
either the thickness or material composition of the body 12.
[0030]      As shown, for example, for example, in FIG. 4A, a front brake disc 24 is connected
to the front side surface 18 of the wheel 10 and a rear brake disc 24' is connected to the rear
side surface 20. The front brake disc 24 and the rear brake disc 24' may be arranged so that
corresponding segments 126 of the brake discs 24, 24' are aligned through the wheel 10.
Generally, it is preferable to affix the brake discs 24, 24' to more rigid regions of the wheel
body 12 to improve braking performance.         The brake discs 24, 24' are formed of arcuate
segments 126 connected around the hub 14 of the wheel 10 to form a closed annular ring,
which may be referred to as a friction ring. The segments 126 may be identical in shape and
size or may have different shapes and sizes, depending on performance and space
requirements for the wheel and/or braking mechanism. The number of segments 126 may be
9653666_1 (GHMatters) P101301.AU.1                6

even or odd. For example, the front brake disc 24 illustrated in FIG. 1 has six identical
segments configured to form a ring. Each segment 126 includes an outer side 128, which
functions as a standard braking surface 130.       The braking surface 130 is configured to be
contacted by a brake shoe or pad controlled by a braking mechanism. An inner side 132
(shown in FIG. 3) is located opposite the outer side 128 of the segment 126. The inner side
132 is configured to contact the front side surface 18 or rear side surface 20 of the wheel
body 12 to impart the braking force along the wheel surface in the circumferential direction.
[0031]      With reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, the inner side 132 may include protrusions 134,
such as fins, extending from the inner side 132 of the segment 126. The protrusions 134 are
effective for cooling the segment during use. Particularly, the protrusions 134 separate the
segment 126 from the front side surface 18 or rear side surface 20 (shown in FIG. 4A) of the
wheel 10, allowing air to pass through the open space. The air effectively cools the segment
126 and provides a more even temperature gradient during use. In certain embodiments, as
shown in FIG. 3, the protrusions 134 extend radially outward from a inner circumferential
side of the segment 126 to an outer circumferential side of the segment 126. In that case, the
protrusions 134 form channels for directing airflow radially away from the brake discs 24,
24'.
[0032]      Having generally described the structure of the brake disc 24 and arcuate segments
126, various structures for connecting adjacent segments 126 to each other, to corresponding
segments 126 on the rear brake disc 24' on the other side of the wheel 10, and to the body 12
of the wheel 10, will now be described in detail. More specifically, the segment 126 includes
a number of holes and grooves extending from the inner side 132 thereof. The holes and
grooves are configured to receive various fasteners, pins, coupling members, and joining
elements.
[0033]      With reference to FIGS. 1-3 and 5, the segments 126 are separated from one
another by a radial gap 36 (shown in FIG. 1) between the radial ends 142 of adjacent
segments 126 so that the segments 126 can freely expand or contract depending on the
temperature and force applied by the brake shoe or pad. The segments 126 are connected
together by joining elements 38 extending across the gap 36. The joining element 38 may be
a pin, fastener, or slider as is known in the art. The joining elements 38 are configured to be
inserted in sockets 140 extending inward from the radial ends 142 of each segment 126, such
that each joining element 38 extends between corresponding sockets 140 of adjacent
segments 126. In one embodiment, the depth of each socket 140 is greater than the length of
the associated joining element 38. Accordingly, the segments 126 are free to move, relative
9653666_1 (GHMatters) P101301.AU.1                 7

to the joining elements 38, causing the joining element 38 to insert farther into one segment
126 and to pull away from the adjacent segment 126.         The sockets 140 have a generally
circular cross-section and are equidistant from the central axis X (shown on FIG. 1) of the
segment 126.        In one embodiment, each radial end 142 of each segment 126 includes two
sockets 140 in a side-by-side arrangement. Including two sockets 140 on each radial end 142
restricts rotation of the segments 126 relative to one another and assists in limiting movement
of the segments 126 in the radial direction.
[0034]      With reference to FIGS. 1-4B, the segments 126 further include transverse through
holes 144 extending between the outer side 128 and inner side 132 of the segment 126. The
holes 144 are configured to receive a fastener 46, such as a screw or bolt. The fasteners 46
may connect the segment 126 to the body 12 of the wheel 10. Alternatively, as shown in
FIG. 4A, the fasteners 46 may extend through the wheel body 12 to a corresponding segment
126 on the opposite side of the wheel 10.        In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 1, each
segment 126 includes two such through holes 144 having a circular cross-section. The holes
144 are positioned along the central longitudinal axis X of the segment 126 and are
equidistant from the segment center.
[0035]      With continuing reference to FIGS. 1-4B, the fastener 46 is inserted through the
hole 144, and rigidly and fixedly connects the segment 126 positioned on the front brake disc
24 to a corresponding segment 126 of the rear brake disc 24'. A top portion of the fastener 46
may be recessed within the transverse through hole 144 so that it does not extend above the
hole opening. Recessing the fastener 46 ensures that it does not contact or obstruct the brake
shoe or brake pad of the brake mechanism. The fastener 46 may be connected to the segment
126 with a washer 52 and a nut 54 or with other fastening and connecting structures, as are
known in the art. In an alternative embodiment, the holes 144 may not be included on the
body of the segments 126.          Instead, the segment 126 may include additional structural
elements, such as appendices or brackets (not shown) connected to and extending from the
segments 126. The fasteners 46 may be inserted through holes in the appendices or brackets.
[0036]       With reference to FIGS. 1, 3, and 6, the segment 126 further includes a groove 156
adapted to receive a coupling member 62 to form a pivot joint 58. As will be described
hereinafter, the pivot joint 58 prevents the segment 126 from sliding radially outward along
the surface of the wheel 10 as a result of centripetal force and thermal expansion.         The
coupling member 62 may include a head 64 located on each end of the coupling member 62
shaped to be inserted in the groove 156, and a cylindrical shaft 66 extending therebetween.
The head 64 and shaft 66 may be separate members connected together by a known fastener
9653666_1 (GHMatters) P101301.AU.1                  8

or adhesive or may be integrally formed. The groove 156 includes an opening 160 extending
inward from the inner side 132 of the segment 126. The head 64 of the coupling member 62
is shaped for insertion through the opening 160 into the groove 156.           Once the coupling
member 62 is inserted in the groove 156, the segment 126 is permitted to freely rotate in at
least one direction about the head 64.       The shaft 66 of the coupling member 62 may be
inserted into a through hole 68 extending from the front side surface 18 to the rear side
surface 20 of the wheel body 12. In this configuration, one end of the coupling member 62 is
inserted in a groove 156 of a segment 126 of the front brake disc 24 and the other end of the
coupling member 62 is inserted in a groove 156 for the corresponding segment 126 of the
rear brake disc 24'.
[0037]      In a non-limiting embodiment, the pivot joint 58 is an ellipsoid or condyloid joint.
In that case, the head 64 of the coupling member 62 is an ellipsoid configured for insertion in
the groove 156 through an elliptical opening 160. A condyloid joint is freely rotatable along
the latitudinal and longitudinal axis of the groove 156. However, the condyloid joint prevents
the segment 126 from twisting or rotating. In an alternative embodiment, the pivot joint 58
may be a ball and socket joint (e.g., spherical joint) having a circular opening 160 that would
also permit twisting rotation about the head 64. Each segment 126 includes its own groove
156 and is configured to receive a corresponding coupling member 62. Accordingly, each
segment 126 is permitted to rotate in the directions permitted by the pivot joint 58, but is
prevented from sliding radially inward or outward along the wheel side surfaces 18, 20.
[0038]      More specifically, the pivot joint 58 effectively creates a fixed point around which
the segment 126 can expand or contract.            Including a pivot joint 58 prevents radial
displacement of the segment 126 during thermal expansion, ensuring that the segment 126 is
properly aligned with the brake pad or shoe and preventing wear to the edges of the segments
caused by improper alignment. Similarly, the pivot joint 58 is effective for maintaining the
segment 126 in the desired position by resisting centripetal force caused by rotation of the
wheel 10 about the hub 14, which tends to force the segment 126 toward the outer rim 16.
The pivot joint 58 also effectively transmits the braking force applied by the brake
mechanism to the wheel to restrict wheel rotation. Finally, since the head 64 of the coupling
member 62 is not fixedly connected to the segment 126, but merely rests within the
corresponding groove 156, lateral deformation of the wheel body 12 is not transmitted to the
segment 126. Since such deformation of the wheel body 12 is not transmitted to the segment
126, structural integrity of the segment 126 is preserved.      Specifically, the segment 126 is
9653666_1 (GHMatters) P101301.AU.1                 9

protected from bending, improper wear, misalignment with the brake shoe, or other
deforming forces that would weaken the segment 126 following prolonged use.
[0039]      With reference to FIG. 1, in use, a braking force F is applied to corresponding
segments 126 of the front brake disc 24 on the front 18 and the rear brake disc 24' (shown in
FIG. 4A) on the rear 20 side surfaces of the wheel 10 by the brake shoes or pads of a brake
mechanism. The braking force F is transmitted to the wheel 10 by both the inner side 132 of
the segment 126 and coupling member 62. More particularly, the force F is applied in the
circumferential direction causing the segments 126 contacted by the brake shoe or pads to
pivot thereby transmitting force to adjacent segments 126 as well. Since the segments 126
are slidably connected by the joining elements 38, the segments 126 are permitted to pivot or
rotate in response to the applied force. However, since forces applied to adjacent segments
126 on opposite sides of the contacted segment 126 are equal in force, but opposite in
direction, rotation of the segments 126 is restricted.         Therefore, the segments 126 are
effectively locked together, meaning that the brake discs 24, 24' function as continuous or
unitary structures, even though the segments 126 are separated by the radial gap 36.
[0040]      As force F is applied to the segments 126, heat is created causing the contacted
segment 126 to expand. The segments 126 are also exposed to centripetal forces that tend to
push the segments 126 radially outward toward the outer rim 16 of the wheel 10. However,
even as the segment 126 expands, it is prevented from sliding as a result of the contact
between the groove 156 and head 64 of the coupling member 62. In this way, the pivot joint
58 is a fixed point around which the segment 126 can expand.                  Beneficially, radial
displacement of the segment 126 is effectively prevented. Instead, the segment 126 is only
permitted to pivot or rotate in directions restricted by the shape of the pivot joint 58.
