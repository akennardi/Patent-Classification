                  HEAD UNIT FOR USE IN A PERSONAL PROTECTION SYSTEM
The          entire        contents of complete                 specifications  of Australian Patent Application
Nos. 2006270252 and 2015268622 as originally filed are incorporated herein by reference.
                                                           Field of the Invention
[0001]                       The present invention generally relates to personal protection systems for use in
medical environments, such as surgical environments, to protect both patients from
contamination during surgical procedures, and to protect medical professionals from exposure
to airborne contaminants and bodily fluids. More particularly, the system of this invention
offers illumination, communication and reduces the physical strain imposed on the wearer.
                                                        Background of the Invention
[0002]                       Personal protection systems are used in surgical procedures to provide a sterile
barrier between the surgical personnel and the patient. One such system is disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 5,054,480, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference discloses that
basic structure of such a system. Specifically, the traditional system includes a helmet that
supports a toga or a hood. This assemblage is worn by medical/surgical personnel that want to
establish the sterile barrier. The toga or the hood includes a transparent face shield. The helmet
includes a ventilation unit that includes a fan. The ventilation unit draws air through the
toga/hood so the air is circulated around the wearer. This reduces both the amount of heat that
is trapped within the toga/hood and the C02 that builds up in this space. It is further known to
mount a light to the helmet. The light, which is directed through face shield illuminates the
surgical site.
[0003]                        Conventional personal protection systems do a reasonable job of providing a
sterile barrier between the surgical personnel and the surrounding environment. However,
there are some limitations associated with their use. The toga/hood that covers the wearer
blocks sound waves. This means an individual wearing the system may have to speak loudly,
even shout, to be heard. This is especially the case when the hooded individual is trying to
communicate with another individual similarly attired.

                                                                -2
[0004]                       Furthermore, while it is known to provide light with the helmet, it has proven
difficult to provide a workable light. This is because in one proposed system, it is proposed
that the actual light be emitted by a source at a static console. The light is supplied to the
helmet for emission therefrom through a fiber optic cable. Thus with this system, the wearer is
essentially tethered to the light source. This both limits the mobility of the individual and
requires other operating room personnel to navigate around the tether. Alternatively, the light
source could be mounted in the helmet. Such light sources generate heat. This heat can cause
the temperature beneath the toga/hood to rise to an uncomfortable level.
[0005]                       Moreover, the helmet and the equipment it supports, places a load on the head
of the wearer. Over time this load can impose an appreciable strain on the muscles and skeletal
structure.
                                                        Summary of the Invention
[0006]                       According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a head
unit for use with a personal protection system including a hood, said head unit to be worn on
the head of an individual and comprising: a head band to be worn around the head of the
individual; a face frame; and a ventilation unit attached to said head band to be positioned
above the head of the individual, said ventilation unit comprising: a lower shell; an upper
shell; and a fan, which is housed by said lower shell and said upper shell, wherein the lower
shell comprises a base curved along a longitudinal axis thereof to approximate the curvature of
a portion of the skull over which it is positioned.
[0006A]                      According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
personal protection system comprising: a head unit including a head band, to be worn on the
head of an individual; a ventilation unit mounted to said head band to be positioned above the
head, and over a portion of the skull, of the individual, said ventilation unit comprising: a base
curved along a longitudinal axis thereof to approximate the curvature of said portion of the
skull; an outlet opening; an inlet; and a fan disposed in a void space of said ventilation unit
and being rotatable to draw air into said inlet such that it is discharged through said outlet
opening; a nozzle connected to said ventilation unit such that discharged air from said fan is

discharged therethrough; and a hood mountable over said head unit and having a transparent
face shield.
[0007]                       The system may include a ventilation unit for supplying ventilation air
underneath the toga/hood of wearer. There is a light unit. The light unit has a light source
positioned in line with the air discharged from the ventilation unit. This arrangement
minimizes the build up of heat around the light unit.
[0008]                       The system may include an inhelmet mounted RF communications system.
[0009]                       The system may include a head unit that substitutes for a conventional helmet.
The head unit includes a head band and a ventilation unit that is suspended above the head
band. The ventilation unit is adjustably positioned relative to the head band. This allows the
ventilation unit to be positioned relative to the head of the wearer so it is located where it will
impose only a minimal strain on the wearer.

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
        I.              OVERVIEW
[00067]                      Referring to the Figures, wherein like numerals indicate like or corresponding
parts throughout the several views, a personal protection system is generally shown at 10.
[00068]                      The personal protection system 10 is adapted from the personal protection
system 10 disclosed in United States Patent No. 6,481,019 to Diaz et al. and United States
Provisional Patent Application No. 60/664,900, both of which are hereby incorporated by
reference. The personal protection system 10 of the present invention is implemented as a
helmet assembly 12 mountable to the head 14 of a user, as shown in Figure 1.
[00069]                      The personal protection system 10 filters air between the head 14 and body 16
of a user, e.g., a medical professional, and an environment external to the user. The helmet
assembly 12 distributes air about the head 14 of the user as will be described below. More
specifically, the helmet assembly 12 distributes air toward both a front of the head 14, i.e., a
face of the user, and a back of the head 14, i.e., a neck of the user.
[00070]                      Referring to Figure 2, the helmet assembly 12 includes a shell 17 having an
inner shell portion 18 facing the user and an outer shell portion 20 facing away from the user.
The outer shell portion 20 is spaced apart from the inner shell portion 18 to define at least one
air flow channel 26 between the inner and outer shell portions 18, 20. It is to be understood
that the present invention may include more than one discrete air flow channel 26. The
illustrated embodiment includes a single unitary air flow channel 26 and the present invention
will be described below in terms of this air flow channel 26. The shell 17 is preferably formed
of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), but may be formed, in alternative plastics.
[00071]                      The helmet assembly 12 also includes a facial section 40 extending from the
shell 17 to define a facial opening 42. The facial section 40 of the helmet assembly 12 is a chin
bar 44. The chin bar 44 is flexible and is formed of plastic such as polypropylene. The
flexibility of the chin bar 44 protects the wearer's face and absorbs impact when the user
contacts an external object with the helmet assembly 12. The chin bar 44 also holds the hood
92 (Figure 1) away from the face of the wearer

                                                            -9
        II.             HELMET
[00072]                      Referring to Figures 2-3, the helmet assembly 12 includes a fan module 46
mounted in a cavity 38 in the shell 17 Fan module 46 includes a fan 50 and a motor 52
mounted to a scroll housing 48. Fasteners M that extend through the shell 17 into threaded
bores in the housing 48 to hold the module 46 in cavity 38 (housing bores not shown). A cover
plate 47 is fixed to the shell 17 below cavity 38 to cover the fan module 46. A cushion 49 is
disposed between the cover plate 47 and a base of the fan module 46. The cushion 49 absorbs
the sound emitted by the fan motor 52. This reduces the amount of noise emitted by the system
 10 of this invention. The scroll housing 48 may be formed of glassfilled polypropylene to
reduce vibrations.
[00073]                      The helmet assembly 12 further includes an intake grid 100 mounted to the
outer shell portion 20. The intake grid 100 includes a top surface spaced from the outer shell
portion 20 of the helmet assembly 12. The intake grid 100 is contoured to the outer shell
portion 20 between the front and rear of the shell 17. Air is drawn into the scroll housing 48
through the intake grid 100 by the fan 50.
[00074]                      Also shown in Figure 3 are various fasteners and washers, not identified, that
secure the components forming helmet assembly 12 together.
[00075]                        In operation, the motor 52 rotates the fan 50 to draw air into the air inlet 64 of
the scroll housing 48 through the intake grid 100. The air is discharged through two spaced
openings in the scroll housing 48. A first opening 51 seen in Figure 3A, is in the front of the
scroll housing 48. The air discharged from opening 51 flows directly into the opening 25 into
air flow channel 26. From channel 26, the air is discharged from an outlet opening 35 between
the inner and outer shell portions 18 and 20, respectively, in the front of the shell 17
[00076]                      The second opening, opening 53, is located in the rear of the scroll housing 48,
best seen in Figure 3B. The air discharged from opening 53 flows into a manifold mounted to
the rear of the scroll housing 48. From the manifold, the air is discharged from two
downwardly directed nozzles. The manifold and nozzles are formed as a single unit, S in

                                                          - 10
Figure 3. When the system 10 is worn, the nozzle discharge ports are positioned adjacent the
back of the neck of the wearer.
[00077]                      The air flow channel 26 defined between the inner and outer shell portions 18,
20 terminates at the front section 34 with the front air exits. More specifically, the inner and
outer shell portions 18, 20 converge toward the front section 34 to define the front air exits.
The front air exits may have an air deflector defined between the outer shell portion 20 and the
inner shell portion 18 wherein the outer shell portion 20 angles toward the inner shell portion
 18 at the front air exits for proper deflection of air toward the front of the head 14 of the user.
Such an air deflector is best shown in U.S. Patent No. 6,481,019 et al., which, again, is hereby
incorporated by reference. Air flow channel 26 diverges upon approaching the front air exits.
The convergence and divergence of the air flow channel 26 maintains a balanced flow of air
about the user's head 14. Ultimately, this also has the effect of minimizing or even completely
eliminating noise within the helmet assembly 12 due to the air flow.
[00078]                      Referring to Figures 2, 3, 4 and 8, an adjustable head band 128 assists in
minimizing the strain on the head 14 and the neck of the user. Strain and torque on the head 14
and neck of the user is minimized by maintaining the weight of the fan 50 and motor 52 over
the neck of the user even upon adjustment of the helmet assembly 12 to fit various sized heads
 14. The head band 128 includes a rear support 130 that rigidly extends from the shell 17. It is
understood that the rear support 130 can be a separate part that is connected to the helmet
assembly 12 or can be an integral part of the helmet assembly 12. The rear support 130
includes first and second rigid connectors 132 that connect the rear support 130 to the rear
section 36. In the preferred embodiment, the rear support 130 is connected to and extends from
the rear section 36 of the inner shell portion 18 and will be described below in terms of the
inner shell portion 18. However, it is to be understood that the 10 rear support 130 can connect
to and extend from any portion of the shell 17.
[00079]                        An adjustment segment 134 having a first side 136 and a second side 138 is
also part of head band 128. Although not required, the rear support 130 preferably includes the
adjustment segment 134. In the preferred embodiment, the adjustment segment 134 is integral
to, or the same part as, the rear support 130. In alternative embodiments, the adjustment

                                                           - 11
segment 134 is a discrete component that is simply mounted to the rear support 130. In either
situation, the adjustment segment 134 defines apertures 140 for receiving a first end 144 and a
second end 146 of a strap 142 flexibly connected to and extending from the front section 34 of
the inner shell portion 18. The first end 144 is disposed within the first side 136 of the
adjustment segment 134, and the second end 146 is disposed within the second side 138 of the
adjustment segment 134. Preferably, the first end 144 is movably disposed within the first side
 136 of the adjustment segment 134, and preferably the second end 146 is movably disposed
within the second side 138 of the adjustment segment 134. However, as will be understood
from the explanation below, the first end 144 may be movably disposed within the first side
 136 of the adjustment segment 134 and the second end 146 maybe fixedly disposed within the
second side 138 of the adjustment segment 134. Alternatively, the first end 144 maybe fixedly
disposed within the first side 136 of the adjustment segment 134 and the second end 146 may
be movably disposed within the second side 138 of the adjustment segment 134.
[00080]                      The strap 142 further includes a frontal portion 148 disposed between its first
and second ends 144, 146 and opposite the adjustment segment 134 of the rear support 130. At
least one support arm 150 flexibly extends from the frontal portion 148 of the strap 142 to
flexibly connect the strap 142 to the front section 34 of the inner shell portion 18. These
support arms 150 act as hinges for the head 14 support assembly. Preferably, there are two
support arms 150 that extend from the frontal portion 148 of the strap 142. In such a case, the
two supports arms are connected to the front section 34 of the inner shell portion 18 and to the
frontal portion 148 of the strap 142 equidistant from one another. A gap 152 exists between
the frontal portion 148 of the strap 142 and the front section 34 of the inner shell portion 18.
III.           TOGA AND HOOD
[00081]                        Referring to Figure 5, the personal protection system 10 includes a toga 88
having a body portion 90 for covering substantially all of the body 16. Toga 92 includes a
hood 92 for covering the head and helmet assembly 12. The body portion 90 can extend
downward to cover any portion of the body 16 of the user. For instance, the body portion 90
can extend downward to the waist of the user, or to the ankles of the user. The hood 92
includes a filter element 94 to filter air between the user and the external environment. The
facial section 40 of the helmet assembly 12, introduced above, also operates to maintain the

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                            - 12
hood 92 away from the head 14 of the user. The intake grid 100 spaces the filter medium 94
out away from the outer shell portion 20 and the fan 50.
[00082]                      As is known in the art, a hood unit may be offered as a covering separate from
the complete toga. This type of hood unit is used when there is only a need to provide a barrier
around the head of the wearer.
[00083]                      A transparent face shield 96 permits the user to view through the hood 92. The
face shield 96 may include anti-reflective and/or anti-refractive coatings to enhance vision
through the face shield 96. As shown in Figure 5, the face shield 96 is mounted to the hood 92
such that the face shield 96 covers the facial section 40 and the facial opening 42 of the helmet
assembly 12 once the user dresses into the personal protection system 10. The face shield 96 is
sewn into the hood 92. The facial opening 42 of the helmet assembly 12 receives the face
shield 96. In this version of the invention, facial section 40 of the helmet assembly 12 includes
a hook-and-loop fastener to further facilitate attachment of the face shield 96 to the facial
section 40 for covering the facial opening 42.
IV.            LIGHT ASSEMBLY AND FAN ASSEMBLY
[00084]                        As shown in Figure 3 and Figures 7-19, the personal protection system 10
includes a light assembly 200. The light assembly 200 is disposed within the hood 92 behind
the face shield 96 to emit a beam of light that projects outside of the hood 92. Since the light
assembly is disposed within the hood 92, there is no need to meticulously clean the light
assembly to keep it to the sterile conditions of a surgical room. Light assembly 200 includes a
light generating unit, light source 201, disposed adjacent to a
lens (not shown).
[00085]                        The light source is preferably one or more lightemitting diodes (LEDs). The
LED emits white light. In one version of the invention, light is emitted at a color temperature
of 5500*K. Light in this spectrum is equivalent to daylight and provides true tissue color
rendition. A light housing 202 supports and surrounds the LEDs and the lens. One suitable
light assembly 200 is the PeriLux LED, manufactured by PeriOptix, Inc. of Mission Viejo,
California. The light source may alternatively be an incandescent light bulb or other suitable

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                             - 13
sources as are well known in the art. One possible alternative is the use of a light source
mounted somewhere on the user and fiberoptic cables to carry the light to the light housing.
[00086]                       The lens is circular in shape. In some versions of the invention, the longitudinal
position of the lens relative to the light source 201 is selectively set. This allows the user to
selectively focus/diffuse the beam of light emitted from the light assembly 200. Many lens
displacement assemblies include a rotating collar. Rotating the collar in a first direction cause
movement of the lens to focus light is concentrated in a small area. Rotation of the collar in the
opposite direction results in movement of the lens so that the emitted light is diffused about a
large area. This rotation of the collar may be done manually or with a focusing servo motor.
Control of the electric servo motor is explained in greater detail below.
[00087]                       Light assembly 200 includes a light angle adjustment mechanism 204.
Mechanism 204 allows the user to change the direction of the beam of light so it can be .
directed to a specific location. Specifically, the light housing 202 is pivotally mounted to two
parallel legs 210 (one shown in Figure 7). Legs 210 are integrally formed with and extend
downwardly from a rigid block 209. Block 209 is attached to the front outer surface of the
strap 142. A pin 211 that extends through the ends of the legs 210 pivotally holds the light
housing 202 to the legs.
[00088]                       A semi-rigid cable 216 regulates the pivotal movement of the light housing
202. The cable 216 is contained in a sheath (not identified). A cable clamp AW and rivet P
cooperate to hold the forward end of the sheath to the exposed face of the inner shell portion
 18. The rear end of the sheath, with the cable 216 contained therein, extends through an
opening in the shell 17 into the void space between the inner and outer shell portions 18 and
20, respectively. A ring clamp AZ is disposed over the front of the housing, immediately
proximal to the front face. The opposed ends of the ring clamp (one shown as element 206 in
Figure 8) extend upwardly towards shell 17. An elongated screw 217 (Figure 3) extends
between ring clamp ends 206 to compression secure the ring clamp AZ to the light housing
202. The front end of the cable 216 is wrapped around the exposed section of screw BA
between the ring clamp end sections 206.

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                             - 14
[00089]                        As seen in Figure 10, a lever arm 214 disposed inside shell 17, selectively
extends and retracts the cable 216. Lever arm 214 is connected by a pin (not identified) to an
adjustment knob 212 located outside of the shell 17 (Figure 9). The pin extends through the
shell outer portion. The proximal end, the rear end of the cable 216 is attached to the end of
the lever arm 214 distal from the pin. The rotation of the knob and lever arm subassembly thus
results in the extension/retraction of the cable. The cable movement, in turn pivots the light
housing 202 around the axis defined by pin 211.
[00090]                      The light housing 202 and, more particularly, the light source 201, are
positioned directly under the front air outlet opening 35. By positioning as such, the air
discharged from opening 35 blows the warm air surrounding the light assembly 200 away
from the light assembly. This reduces the build up of heated air adjacent the light assembly.
Instead, the heated air is exhausted out of the hood 92. The removal of this heated air lessens
the extent to which the heat generated by the light assembly excessively warms the wearer of
the personal protection system 10.
[00091]                       Still another feature of this construction of the invention is that it minimizes the
extent to which the temperature of the light assembly 200 itself rises due to the heat emitted by
source 201. By maintaining the light source 201 at a relatively low temperature, the source
itself is able to function as a relatively efficient light emitter. (The light-emitting efficiency of
LED type light source drops with an increase in the temperature of the LED.)
[00092]                      Referring now to Figure 20, the control circuit for motor 52 and light source
201 are shown in block form. Power supply 70 energizes both the motor and the light source.
In alternative versions of the invention, power supply 70 may be divided into a pair of power
supplies, with each power supply individually powering the motor 52 or the light assembly
200.
[00093]                      Power supply 70 is preferably at least one cell (i.e., battery). The at least one
cell may be rechargeable. However, non-rechargeable (i.e., disposable) cells may also be used.
In one version of the invention, power supply 70 provides a 6 VDC power signal. However,
other voltages may alternatively be implemented.

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                          - 15
[00094]                      The first power supply 70 is preferably mounted to the body 16 of the user as
shown in Figure 5. By mounting the first power supply 70 outside of the toga 88, it can be
easily replaced (i.e., switched out) during a medical/surgical procedure. In some versions of
the invention, power supply 70 is located where it is accessible through the toga.
Alternatively, the first power supply 70 may be disposed within, i.e., integrated into, the
helmet assembly 12.
[00095]                      Referring again to Figure 21, the personal protection system 10 further includes
a fan control circuit 224 for regulating the actuation of the fan motor 52. A voltage regulator
220 applies a constant voltage signal to control circuit 224 for energizing the control circuit.
Voltage regulator 220 regulates the 6 VDC electric current received from the power supply. In
one version of the invention, voltage regulator 220 provides a 3.3 VDC electric current which
energizes the fan control circuit 224.
[00096]                      A light control circuit selectively applies an energization signal to the light
source 201 to control both the on/off state of the light source and the intensity of the light
emitted by the source. In Figure 21, the light control circuit is shown as current regulator 230.
The current regulator 230 receives a constant voltage energization signal from a voltage
regulator 222. In one version of the invention, voltage regulator 222, which is connected to
power supply 70, supplies a 3.6 VDC signal to current regulator 230.
[00097]                        In some versions of the invention a single voltage regulator provides a
common constant voltage to both the fan control circuit and the light control circuit. In some
versions of the invention, there may not even be a need to provide a voltage regulated
energization signal to either the fan control circuit or the light control circuit. Thus, in some
versions of the invention, either one or both of the fan and light control circuits are powered
directly from the power supply 70.
[00098]                      The fan control circuit 224 is electrically connected to the fan motor voltage
regulator 220 and the motor 52. The fan control circuit 224 receives electric current from the
fan motor voltage regulator 220 and conditions the electric current to control the speed of the

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                            - 16
motor 52 and the fan 50.
[00099]                      In the illustrated version of the invention, the fan control circuit 224 provides
implements pulse-width modulation (PWM) for controlling the speed of the motor 52 and the
fan 50. To accomplish the PWM, the fan control circuit 224 includes a microcontroller 118
and a power transistor 226. The microcontroller 118 includes a plurality of inputs and outputs.
Two switches 120 and 122 are pushbuttons are electrically connected to individual inputs of
the microcontroller 118. (Not identified are the pull up resistors associated with the switches.)
The user presses the pushbuttons to adjust the desired speed of the fan 50 (and the
consequential air flow). The switches are in the form of pushbuttons mounted to the side of the
helmet assembly 12 and are easily operable by the user through the hood 92.
[000100]                     At least one output of the microcontroller 118 is electrically connected to the
power transistor 226 to selectively turn on and turn off the transistor based on the desired
speed of the fan 50. More specifically, the energization signal applied through the transistor is
a PWM signal having a constant frequency anda variable on duty cycle that is directly
proportional to the desired fan speed.
[000101]                     Power transistor 226 is in one version of the invention, actually a pair of power
MOSFETs, the individual MOSFETs not shown. Here a primary MOSFET is a P-channel type
and a secondary MOSFET is an N-channel type. The drain of the primary MOSFET is tied to
the positive input of the power supply. The source of the primary MOSFET is tied to fan
motor 52. The gate of the primary MOSFET is tied to the positive terminal of the battery
through a resistor. The drain of the secondary MOSFET is also tied to the gate of the primary
MOSFET. The source of the secondary MOSFET is tied to ground. The gate of the secondary
MOSFET is connected to a control line from the microcontroller 118. Thus, the signal present
at the drain of the secondary MOSFET gates the primary MOSFET. The IRF7307TR Power
MOSFET manufactured by International Rectifier, headquartered in El Segundo, California is
a single package that contains both the P- and N-channel MOSFETs that collectively form
power transistor 226. Of course, those skilled in the art realize other possible implementations
of the power transistor 226 are possible.

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                           - 17
[000102]                     Microcontroller 118 is preferably is a Model ATmega8 manufactured by Atmel
Corporation, headquartered in San Jose, California. The ATmega8 includes built-in PWM
support. Other suitable microcontrollers 118 or microprocessors are evident to those skilled in
the art. The microcontroller 118 may also be used for functions separate from controlling the
speed of the fan 50, as is described in greater detail below.
[000103]                       In one version of the invention, the current through motor 52 is used as
feedback signal to establish the PWM rate. A resistor (not illustrated) is tied between the
motor 52 and ground. The voltage across the resistor is applied to microcontroller 118 so as to
serve as an indication on the motor speed. Motor speed is adjusted by varying the percent on
duty cycle of the pulse per fixed total period (on and off) of the pulse.
[000104]                       Microcontroller 118 may also be electrically connected to the focusing servo
motor and the light angle servo motor. This eliminates the need to hand adjust the light.
[000105]                     In addition to controlling the volume of air flowing into the helmet assembly
 12, the invention provides an audible indication of when the fan is at the minimum and a
maximum air flow rates. This indication is provided by momentarily resetting the frequency of
the PWM signal applied to the motor. This in turn, causes the motor to be actuated at a rate
that causes is shaft to rotate in a manner that causes sound detectable by the human ear to be
emitted. This sound provides an audible indication of the minimum and the maximum volume
of air to the user. That is, the present invention provides the user with an audible 'ping' upon
reaching the minimum and maximum volumes of air flowing into the helmet assembly 12.
[000106]                     This ping is also provided each time the control circuit 224, in response to the
depression of one of the control buttons, raises or lowers the speed of the fan motor 52. At the
opposed high and low ends of the motor speeds, the controller is configured to actuate the
motor so two closely spaced apart in time pings are emitted at the same frequency. This
provides the user notice the maximum or minimum motor speed setting has been reached.
[000107]                       The audible ping is provided by, for a brief period, -for example between 0.1
and 0.2 seconds, running the fan motor at a frequency at which the motor generates an audible

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                           - 18
sound. For example, during normal actuation of the motor, the constant frequency of the
energization signal applied by the control circuit 224 is 30.3 kHz. Between the transition from
outputting the energization signal at a first duty cycle to a second duty cycle, (in order to
change the speed of the motor), the energization pulses are applied to the motor at a frequency
of between 261 to 523 Hz at a 50% duty cycle. As a result of the energization pulses being
applied at this frequency, the speed of the motor drops appreciably. This causes the motor 52
to emit a tone detectable by the human ear
[000108]                     In some versions of the invention, the frequency at which the motor is actuated
in order to generate the ping varies with new speed range the motor is being set to operate at.
For example, in one embodiment of this version of the invention, prior to each time the control
circuit 224 increases the on duty cycle of the motor energization signal in order to increase
motor speed, the control circuit first applies a high frequency ping-generating energization
signal. This results in a relative high frequency ping signal being generated. Prior to the
control circuit 224 decreasing the on duty cycle for the energization signal in order to decrease
motor speed, the control circuit applies a lower frequency ping-generating energization signal.
This results in the emission of a lower frequency ping from the motor 52. Thus, the surgical
personnel not only receive an audible indication the fan speed is being reset, they receive an
indication regarding if the speed is being lowered or increased.
[000109]                     However, it is to be understood that the frequency at which the motor is
selectively actuated may otherwise be within the acceptable range of unaided human hearing
(30 Hz to 20 kHz) so long as it provides the audible indication. The frequency of the activation
rate causes various components of the motor 52 of the fan module 46 to vibrate at the
frequency thereby generating the audible indication.
[000110]                     Alternatively, the fan control circuit 224 includes a potentiometer, also
commonly referred to as a variable resistor or varistor, to control the speed of the motor 52
and fan 50, instead of utilizing PWM. Additional implementations for varying the speed of the
motor 52 and fan 50 are known to those skilled in the art and may be alternatively utilized.
[000111]                       A printed circuit board 228 (PCB) is disposed within the helmet assembly 12.

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                         - 19
The PCB 228 supports the voltage regulators 220, 222, the microcontroller 118, and associated
electronic devices. The PCB 228 includes conductive tracks to electrically connect items
mounted on the PCB 228, as is well known to those skilled in the art.
[000112]                     The personal protection system 10 also includes a light current regulator 230
for providing a constant current, regardless of voltage, to the light source. By keeping the
current constant, the light source provides a steady illumination that does not degrade as the
cells of the first power supply 70 drain and lose voltage. The light current regulator 230 is
preferably integrated with the light assembly 200 within the light housing. However, the light
current regulator 230 may be disposed on the PCB 228.
[000113]                     The personal protection system 10 also includes a low power detection circuit
for alerting the user when the cells of power supply 70 are running low. In the preferred
embodiment, a voltage divider circuit 232 comprising a pair of resistors is electrically
connected to the first power supply 70. The signal present at the junction of the resistors is
applied as an input signal to microcontroller 118. An enunciator 234 is electrically connected
to one of the outputs of the microcontroller 118. The enunciator 234 may be an indicating
LED, preferably mounted within the helmet assembly 12 and within the field of view of the
user. The enunciator 234 may also be a loudspeaker for producing an audible signal that is
hearable by the user, or a combination of the loudspeaker and LED. Alternatively, the
enunciator 234 may be substituted with selectively activating and deactivating the power
transistor 226 to vibrate the fan and generate an audible signal, as described above.
V.              COMMUNICATIONS UNIT
[000114]                     Referring to Figures 22-27, personal protection system 10 also includes a
communications unit 236. The communications unit 236 provides wireless communication
between other communications units 236. The other communication units may be integrated
with other personal protection systems 10 or embodied as one or more stand-alone units. The
communications units 236 allow for convenient voice communications between the users of
the personal protection systems 10.
[000115]                     The communications unit 236 includes a microphone 238, a speaker 240, and a

                                                           - 20
transceiver 242. Communications unit 236 also includes a second power supply 244. The
second power supply 244 powers transceiver 242. Second power supply 244 is preferably at
least one cell. The at least one cell is preferably rechargeable; however, nonrechargeable cells
may also be used. The at least one cell may be a single cell or a plurality of cells connected
together. The transceiver 242 and second power supply 244 are often packaged together and
mountable on the body 16 of the user.
[000116]                     Alternatively, as seen in Figure 26, the transceiver 242 is electrically connected
to the first power supply 70, such that the user would not have to carry multiple power
supplies. In these versions of the invention a third voltage regulator 241 provides a third
constant voltage signal to the transceiver 242. This third voltage is different from the regulated
voltages provided to the fan control circuit 224 and the light control circuit (current regulator
230). Transceiver 242 may also be alternatively disposed within the helmet assembly 12.
[000117]                     Microphone 238 converts speech into electrical signals. The signals produced
by the microphone 238 are applied to the transceiver 242. Transceiver 242 is preferably a
radio frequency (RF) transceiver 242 capable of transmitting and receiving RF signals. The
transceiver 242 converts the electrical signal into an RF signal and transmits the RF signal.
The transmitted RF signal may then be received by the transceivers 242 of the other
communication units. The transceiver 242 converts the received RF signal into an electrical
signal. The speaker 240 is electrically connected to the transceiver 242 and receives the
electrical signal from the transceiver 242. The speaker 240 decodes the electrical signal into an
audio wave which can be heard by the user.
[000118]                     Microphone 238 is attached to the chin bar 44 of the helmet assembly 12. A
cable 239 (shown in phantom) over which the signals produced by the microphone is similarly
disposed in the chin bar 44. The microphone may be mounted to other locations on the helmet.
[000119]                     In one version of the invention, speaker 240 is an earpiece. The earpiece
includes a hook shaped to be worn on the ear of the user. A bud with the actual sound
generating transducer is attached to the hook. The bud is shaped to be positioned adjacent or in
the ear canal of the user. The audio signal cable that supply signals to the bud are mounted to

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                         - 21
the helmet. The front end of the cable is however, not mounted to the helmet. This provides a
degree of flexibility between the earpiece and the helmet shell 17. This flexibility
accommodates for differences in body size of individual users. This flexibility also allows the
user to move his/her head while using the personal protection system 10 of the invention while
the earpiece remains in place. Also, multiple mounting assemblies are provided in the helmet.
This allows the earpiece to be mounted for insertion in either ear of the user of the system 10.
[000120]                     Transceivers 242, in one version of the invention, operate in the 900 MHz
band. The individual transceivers exchange digital, spread spectrum RF signals. The
communications units 236 preferably operate in full duplex, i.e., the transceivers 242 can
transmit and receive RF signals at the same time. One example of a suitable transceiver 242 is
the STx 1000 manufactured by Eartec of Narragansett, Rhode Island. Coachcomm of Auburn,
Alabama also markets an appropriate transceiver system. Each of these systems allows three
or more individuals to simultaneously use the surgical protect system 10 of this invention and
communicate in full duplex mode with each other using the transceivers. There is no need to
depress a push-to-talk switch in order for any individual to communicate with another
individual. Thus, this protection system 10 allows a group of individuals (three or more) to
engage in conversation with each other as if in normal group conversation, without having to
raise their voices in order to overcome the sound attenuating of the protective hoods 92 and
the noise generated by the fan 50 and motor 52.
[000121]                     Figure 27 illustrates in block form an alternative transceiver 242a of this
invention. Transceiver 242a includes a modulator 252 for converting audio signals received
from the microphone 238 into RF signals. The RF signals generated by the modulator 252 are
broadcast over communications unit antenna 237. Also connected to antenna 237 is the
transceiver demodulator 254. The demodulator 254 converts the received RF signals into
audio signals that can be used to actuate the speaker 240. [000122] Actuation of the modulator
252 and demodulator 254 is controlled by a transceiver controller 256 also part of transceiver
242a. This transceiver controller 256 could be a conventional digital microprocessor, a PLA or
a DSP. Transceiver controller 256 regulates the actuation of the modulator 252 and
demodulator 254 in part based on the state of three user actuated switches 258, 260 and 262.
An individual wearing system 10 of this invention could actuate one switch, for example

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                         - 22
switch 258, in order to effectively "turn off' the demodulator. 254. An individual takes this
step if he/she does not want to receive the transmissions broadcast by others employing the
communications units. If the individual wants the transceiver 242a in this state, the transmitter
controller could respond by deactivating the demodulator 254. Alternatively, the transceiver
controller 256, in response to the user wanting speaker 240 deactivated, turns on a FET that
causes the audio output signal generated by the demodulator 254 to go to ground (FET not
illustrated).
[000123]                     Transceiver controller 256 also selectively deactivates the output of RF signals
by the modulator 252. The individual using system 10 may want the modulator 252 to
temporarily stop broadcasting RF signals with embedded audio signals if he/she wants to
conduct a conversation with a nearby individual that is not for broadcast. Switch 260 is
actuated to regulate the selective broadcast of the RF modulated audio signals. In response to
the individual wanting the transceiver 242a to not broadcast audio signals, the transceiver
controller 256 temporarily stops actuation of the modulator 252. Alternatively, by switching a
FET (not illustrated) the transceiver controller 256 selectively blocks the forwarding of audio
signals from the microphone to the modulator 252.
[000124]                     The transceiver controller 256 also regulates the modulator 252 to control
which group or groups of other communication units 236 are able to receive signals emitted by
the transceiver 242a. For example, in versions of the invention wherein the individual
transceivers exchange signals using a direct sequence spread spectrum protocol, the
transmitter controller 256 regulates the codes used to establish the modulation of the output
signals and the demodulation of the input signals. In versions of the invention wherein the
individual transceivers exchange signals using a frequency hoping spread spectrum protocol,
transceiver controller 256 generates the code that establishes the frequency hoping pattern of
the carrier frequency. Switch 262 is the control member that is actuated to establish which
group or group of communications units are able to exchange and/or receive signals.
[000125]                     The utility of the protection system of this invention's ability to selective
exchange signals is now explained by reference to Figure 28. Here, five individual
communication units 236a-236e are shown. Arbitrarily, communications unit 236d is one unit

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                            - 23
that has this selective transmission/reception capability. Thus, by depressing switch 262, the
associated transmitter controller 256 configures the transceiver 242a of communication unit
236d so that the broadcast audio signals can be received by all the remaining units 236a, 236b,
236c and 236e or just by unit 236e. This allows a surgeon to have some privacy to
communication with another individual wearing the system 10. Alternatively, this allows a
surgical assistant to communicate with another individual without disturbing the surgeon.
[000126]                       In Figure 29, a receiver 264 is also shown. The receiver is capable of receiving
the signals broadcast by one or more the communication units 236a-236e. The audio signals
broadcast by the receiver 264 can be broadcast through a loudspeaker 263. This may be
desirable in a teaching setting. Alternatively, the audio signals may be stored with the aid of a
recorder 265. Again, by selective modulation of the broadcast signals, the ability of the
receiver to demodulate the signals broadcast by any particular transceiver 242a is selectively
regulated.
[000127]                     Returning to Figure 28, it is seen that a unit processor 272 is connected to the
transceiver controller 256. Digital signals extracted from the received RF signals by the
demodulator 254 are forwarded to the transceiver controller 256. Modulator 252 is able to
embed digital signals received from the transceiver controller 256 into the broadcast RF
signals. Primarily the transceiver controller 256 functions as a intermediate processor for
transmitting digital signals received by the unit processor 272 and forwarding digital signals
used by the unit processor. In some versions of the invention, transceiver controller 256 and
unit processor 272 are a single unit.
[000128]                     The digital RF signals are exchanged with a static RF transceiver 259 seen in
Figure 28. Transceiver 259 is connected to a communications bus 266 in the operating room.
Other units connected to the bus include the below-discussed operating room control head 261
and equipment such as a personal computer 268. One such operating room control head 261 is
sold by the Applicants' Assignee under the trademark SIDNE. This arrangement allows the
transceiver 242a to serve as the unit through which other components of the surgical
protection system 10 exchange signals with remote devices. In Figure 28, the operating room
control head is shown as receiving audio signals from the static receiver 264. In some versions

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                         - 24
of the invention, transceivers 264 and 259 are a single unit.
[000129]                     For example, by speaking into the microphone 238, the surgeon speaks the
command "Focus 28 Light". The audio signal representative of these words is transmitted by
transceiver 242a to the operating room control head. The operating room control head
processes the audio signals to decode the command. Once the command is interpreted, the
operating room control head, through transceiver 259 generates a command data packet to the
transceiver 242a. The transceiver 242a strips out the command message and forwards it to the
unit processor 272. Unit processor 272, upon receipt of the command, generates appropriate
control signals to cause the actuation of the servo motor employed to displace the lens integral
with the light assembly 200.
[000130]                     The speed of the fan motor 52 is similarly regulated by the integrated system of
this invention.
[000131]                      Communication unit 236a can also provides voice actuated control of the other
equipment in the operating room such as the surgical instruments and the operating room
environmental settings (HVAC and light). More specifically, the spoken commands entered
through microphone 238 are transmitted by transceiver 242a and receiver 264 to the operating
room control head 261. The operating room control head then generates the appropriate
instruction packets that are output on bus 266 to the appropriate device that is to act on the
instructions.
[000132]                     The integrated construction of the system of this invention also allows the
personal protection system 10 to report back information regarding its own operating state. In
Figure 28, the signal present at the junction of the two resistors forming voltage divider 232 is
shown as being applied to unit processor 272. In the event the signal present at this point falls
to a level at which indicates the charge stored in power supply 70 is becoming low, the unit
processor 272 generates a data packet with these data. The data packet is forwarded to the
transceiver controller 256 so it is broadcast by the transceiver 242a. The data packet is
received by transceiver 259. This packet is forwarded to the personal computer 268. This
provides personnel in the operating room with notice that the particular power supply 70 worn

VI.            ALTERNATIVE HEAD UNIT
[000133]                     Figures 29 through 34 illustrate an alternative support structure for supporting
hood 92 around the head and upper body of the wearer. This particular support structure is a
head unit 270. Head unit 270 includes a head band 272 to which a ventilation unit 274 and
light 276 (Figure 49) are adjustably mounted. The air forced through the ventilation unit 274 is
discharged through front and rear nozzle assemblies 280 and 282, respectively. The
adjustability of the ventilation unit 274 relative to the head band allows the components
forming the unit, primarily the ventilation fan 278, to be positioned relative to the body of the
wearer where the physical strain the unit imposes on the wearer is minimized.
[000134]                     More particularly, head unit 270 includes a face frame 286 formed of plastic
that has some flexibility. In one version of the invention, face frame 286 is formed from
polypropylene or Nylon. Face frame 286, best seen in Figure 35, is shaped to have a forehead
band 288 that has a curvature designed to allow the bar to fit against the forehead of the
individual. Not shown are padding that may be secured to the inner surface of the forehead
band 288. Extending downwardly from the opposed ends of forehead band 288, face frame
286 has downwardly extending support posts 290. A chin bar 292, also part of face frame 286
extends between the opposed bottom ends of support posts 290. Chin bar 292 has a curved
shape such that forward portion of the guard between the posts 290 extends forward of the
posts.
[000135]                     Also part of face frame 286 is a support strap 294. Support strap 294 is in the
form of a generally rectangular strip and extends upwardly from the center of the forehead
band 288. As discussed below, support strap 294 is the member from which the ventilation
unit 274, light 276 and front nozzle assembly 280 are suspended.
[000136]                     A mounting pin 296 extends outwardly from each of the face frame support
posts 290. Each mounting pin 296 has a stem (not identified) that extends outwardly from the
outer surface of the associated support post 290. Each mounting pin 296 also has a wide
diameter head'298 that forms the free end of the pin. Mounting pins 296 support and secure

the transparent shield integral with the hood.
[000137]                     A head strap 302 extends rearwardly from each end of the face frame forehead
band 288. Collectively, the forehead band 288 and head straps 302 form the head band 272.
Head straps 302 are formed from very flexible plastic such as Nylon 66. Each head strap 302,
as seen in Figure 36, includes a base 306 that has a relatively wide width. Base 306 is seated
against the inner surface of the associated end of the forehead band 288. Two openings 308
extend through each strap base 306. Openings 308 accommodate fasteners (not illustrated,)
that hold the head strap 304 to the face frame 286. In the illustrated versions of the invention, a
counterbore (not identified) extends around each opening 308.
[000138]                     A leg 310 extends downwardly from the each head strap base 306. Each leg
310 has a width less than that of base 306 from which the leg extends. Each head strap 302 31
has a rack 312 that extends from the free end of the leg 310. The racks have a set of teeth (not
identified) that extend laterally away from the longitudinal axis of the rack. Figure 36
illustrates the head strap 302 for the left side of head unit 270. This head strap 302 is formed
so that the rack teeth project downwardly. The head strap 302 for the right side of the head
unit 270 is formed so that the teeth project upwardly. A toe 314 projects perpendicularly away
from the free end of each rack 312. Each toe 314 is directed in the same direction in which the
associated rack teeth are directed.
[000139]                     Rear nozzle assembly 282 both directs the output flow from the fan 278 down
the neck of the wearer and holds head straps 302 together. Rear nozzle assembly 282 includes
a shell 320 and a tip 318 that rotates around the longitudinal axis of the shell.
[000140]                     The rear nozzle assembly shell 320 now described by reference to Figures 37
and 38. Shell 320, is formed from a single piece of plastic and has a three-sided trunk 322
from which two wings 324 extend. More particularly, the trunk 322 is formed to have a back
wall 326 that curves into two opposed side walls 328. Shell 320 is further formed so that the
opposed side walls 328 are inwardly tapered. Consequently, shell 320 is wider at the top than
at the bottom. The shell 320 is further formed to have two spaced apart ribs 330 and 332 that
extend laterally across the inner surface of the shell, from side wall to side wall. Rib 330 is

located around the open end of the shell 320. Rib 332 is parallel to and located below rib 330.
[000141]                      A plate 334 extends from the inner surfaces of back wall 326 and side walls
328. Plate 334 extends to and does not project beyond the inner edges of the side 32 walls 328.
An opening 336 extends through the plate 334. Opening 336 is centered along an axis that
extends longitudinally through the void space defined by the shell back wall 326 and side
walls 328.
[000142]                      A rigid tubular sleeve 340 extends inwardly from the shell back wall 326 so to
project into the void space between the back wall and side walls 328. Sleeve 340 extends from
an opening 342 in the back wall 326. The back wall 326 is further formed to have an annular
ring 344 concentric from and radially spaced away from opening 342 that projects from the
wall outer surface. Ring 344 is formed with spaced apart teeth 346 that extend inwardly to
opening 342.
[000143]                      Each shell wing 324 extends from a separate one of the base side walls 328.
The wings 324 are basically three wall structures that are arranged so that the open faces
thereof extend forwardly, toward face frame 286. Plural spaced apart reinforcing webs 350
extend through the void spaces defined by each wing 324 and the trunk side wall 328 from
which the wing extends. Webs 350 extend laterally, that is perpendicular to the top-to-bottom
longitudinal axis through the shell 320.
[000144]                      A plate 352, also part of the rear nozzle assembly 282, extends over the open
void defined by the shell 320. Plate 352, now described by reference to Figure 39, has a panel
section 354 with a generally concavo-convex profile. The panel section 354 is further formed
to have side edges (not identified) that are inwardly tapered. Panel section 354 is further
formed so that the opposed top and bottom side edges are outwardly bowed. The panel section
354 is also shaped to have curved corners.
[000145]                      Extending outwardly from the inner surface of the panel section 354, the
surface seen in Figure 39, plate 352 33 is shaped to have two four sided reinforcing frames
356. Each reinforcing frame 356 extends outwardly from the inner surface of panel section

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                            -28
354. Each frame 356 has two parallel and spaced apart top and bottom ribs 358. An outer rib
360 located along the adjacent side edge of the panel section 354 extends between ribs 358 at
one end of each frame. An inner rib 362, that is curved toward the side, extends between each
of the ribs at the opposed inner end of each frame 356.
[000146]                      A hole 364 extends through the center of panel section 354. The panel section
354 is formed with an annular rib 366 around the hole 364. The plate 352 is further shaped so
that the frame inner ribs 362 have a center of curvature that is concentric with hole 364.
[000147]                      A foot 368 projects outwardly from the bottom of panel section 354. Foot 368
has a planar base 369 that forms the bottommost structural component of the plate 352. Steps
370 extend from the opposed ends of foot 369 to the adjacent sections of the panel section
bottom edge. Short lips 372 extend from each step 370 a short distance along the adjacent
section of the panel section bottom edge. A reinforcing web 374 extends along the inner
surface of the panel section 354. Web 374 extends between the opposed free ends of lips 372.
The web 374 is parallel with and spaced apart from the two linearly aligned bottom ribs 358 of
the reinforcing frames 356. Thus, a slot 359 is defined between the lowermost ribs 356 and
web 374.
[000148]                      The plate 352 also has a three sided collar 378 that is integral with and extends
a short distance above the panel section 354. Collar 378 has a front wall 380. Two side walls
382 curve inwardly from the opposed ends of the front wall 380. Formed integrally with the
collar are two parallel ribs 384 and 386. Rib 384 extends inwardly across 34the coplanar top
edges of the collar front wall 380 and side walls 382. Rib 386 is located below and is spaced
from rib 384.
[000149]                      A lip 387 extends from each collar outwardly along the panel section top edge.
The lips 387 project away from the inner surface of the panel section 354. A web 390 extends
outwardly from the inner surface of the panel section 354 between the ends of the opposed lips
387. The web 390 is parallel to and located above the opposed, linearly aligned top ribs 378 of
the reinforcing frames 356. Thus, a slot 392 is defined by the top located ribs 356 and web
390.

[000150]                     Plate 352 is further formed to have a support arch 394. The arch 394, which has
a generally circular shape, extends upwardly from top edge of panel section 354. While cross
sectional slices through the arch are of constant diameter, the arch does not lie flat. The arch
394 is angled toward the center. This profile approximately matches the general contour at the
back of the skull. More particularly, the opposed terminuses of arch 394 are each located
between one end of collar 378 and the adjacent panel side edge. As discussed below, arch 394
flexibly supports the ventilation unit 274 above the head of the wearer.
[000151]                     When the rear nozzle assembly 280 is assembled, plate 352 is positioned
against the open, forward directed surfaces of shell 320. A knob 396, also part of the rear
nozzle assembly 282, is mounted to the exposed back surface of the shell 320. The knob 396,
seen best in Figure 40, includes a cylindrical shaft 398. Arcuately spaced apart teeth 402
extend radially outwardly along the shaft 398. The knob shaft 398 is further formed to have a
bore 399 that is open from the free end of the shaft. In one version of the invention, bore 399
extends through a sleeve 401 35 constrict with and located in shaft 398.
[000152]                     The knob 396 also has a head 404 disposed over one end of the shaft 398.
Internal to the head 404 is ring 406 that extends around the portion of the shaft disposed in the
head. Ring 406 is concentric with and spaced radially outwardly from shaft 398. The ring 406
is formed with two diametrically opposed flexible tabs 408 (one shown). Each tab 408 has a
single rib 410 that extends longitudinally along the outer surface of the tab.
[000153]                     The rear nozzle assembly 280 is constructed so that the knob shaft 398 seats in
and extends through shell sleeve 340. The free end of the shaft 398 seats against the annular
space about the reinforcing rib 366 formed in plate 352. A threaded fastener (not illustrated)
extends through plate hole 364 and into bore 399 integral with knob 396. This fastener holds
the panel 352 to the shell 320. When the rear nozzle assembly is so constructed, the ribs 410
integral with knob 396 seat in the void spaces between shell teeth 346.
[000154]                       When head unit 270 is assembled, the head strap racks 312 seat in the slots
between shell 320 and panel 352. This is seen best in Figure 30; here it is understood the left-

right sides of head unit being inverted. Specifically, the rack 312 integral with the right side
head strap 302 seats in slot 359. The rack 312 the forms part of the left side head strap seats in
slot 392. The rack teeth engage knob teeth 402.
[000155]                      Rear nozzle tip 318, now described by Figure 41, includes a tubular base 412.
A lip 414 extends annularly around the open end of base 412 and away from the outer surface
of base. Projecting upwardly from lip 414, nozzle tip 318 has four equangularly spaced apart
mounting tabs 416. Each tab 416 has a head 418 with a tapered outer 36 surface. When the
rear nozzle assembly 282 is put together, tabs 342 snap fit in shell opening 336. Nozzle tip 318
is thus able to rotate relative to the axis that extends through opening 336.
[000156]                      Nozzle tip 318 is formed with a head 420 that partially surrounds the bottom
open end of base 412. The nozzle tip 318 is formed so that tip head 420 is generally shell
shaped such that the open end of base 338 opens into the void space defined by the concave
surface of the head.
[000157]                      Returning to Figure 34 it can be seen that ventilation unit 274 includes lower
and upper shells 428 and 430, respectively, that house a fan 433 and a motor 434. The lower
shell 428, best seen in Figure 42, includes a base 432. The lower shell 428 is formed so that
the base 432 is widest at the center and relatively narrow at the opposed front and rear ends.
Opposed side walls 434 extend upwardly from the side edges of base 432 extend along the
longitudinal side edges of the base. Shell base 432 also has a cylindrical, hollow boss 436 that
extends upwardly from the center of the base. Boss 436 is dimensioned to receive the fan
motor 434. Not identified is the opening in the center of the boss 436 wherein the rotating
shaft of the motor extends therethrough.
[000158]                      The lower shell 428 is formed with two pairs of posts 438 and 440 that receive
fasteners for holding the upper and lower shells together. Each of the posts 438 and 440
extends upwardly from the shell base 432. A first pair of posts, posts 438, are located adjacent
the front end of the lower shell 428. Each post 438 is located inwardly of an adjacent one of
the side walls 434 at the front end of the shell 428. Each post 440 is located inwardly of and
adjacent one of the side walls at the rear of the shell 428.

[000159]                      Two parallel ribs 442 and 444 extend inwardly from the shell base 432 and side
wall 434 adjacent the rear opening these surfaces define. One rib, rib 442 extends inwardly
around the open rear end of the shell. Rib 444 is located forward of and spaced apart from rib
442. While not illustrated, it should be appreciated that similar ribs project outwardly from the
base 432 and side walls 434 at the front end of the lower shell 428.
[000160]                       The lower shell 428 also has a set of baffle plates 438 and 440 that partially
surround and are radially spaced away from boss 436. One plate, plate 438, is generally S
shaped and starts at a locating slightly behind the open front end of the shell and the curves
slightly inwardly. Baffle plate 438 then has a section that is has a radius of curvature that is
centered on the axis of boss 436. This particular section of the baffle plate 438 subtends
approximately 150* of the circumference around the boss 436. Baffle plate 438 also has a tail
section that angles away from the S-section. This section of the baffle plate angles back to and
abuts the adjacent shell side wall 434.
[000161]                      Baffle plate 440 has an arcuate profile. The baffle plate 440 extends from the
side wall 434 opposite the side wall with which plate 438 is associated. Baffle plate 440 is
spaced forward of and substantially covers the open end of the lower shell 428. The baffle
plate 440 subtends an arc of approximately 70* around boss 436. There is an arcuate
separation of approximately 5 to 100 between the arcuate section of baffle plate 438 and the
adjacent plate 440.
[000162]                      The lower shell 428 is also formed so that there are a number of rectangular
openings 442 in the base 432. Openings 442 facilitate the securing of a motor cover 444
(Figure 34) to the exposed bottom surface of the lower shell 428 as discussed below.
[000163]                       The upper shell 430, now described by reference to Figure 43, includes a lid
450 from which two side walls 452 extends. Lid 450 has a shape that generally conforms to
that of lower shell base 432. The lid 450, like the lower shell base 432 is curved along its
longitudinal axis. Side walls 452 extend along the longitudinal side edges of the lid and curve
downwardly from the lid. The lid 450 is formed with a circular center opening 453. When the

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018

shells 428 and 430 are assembled together, opening 453 is coaxial with lower shell boss 436.
[000164]                     The upper shell 430 is further formed to have ribs 454, 456, 458 and 460
similar to the ribs 442 and 44 of the lower shell 428. Two parallel ribs 454 and 456 extend side
wall to side wall at the front end of the upper shell. Rib 454 extends into the opening defined
by the lid 450 and the adjacent side walls 452. Rib 456 is parallel to and spaced behind rib
454. Ribs 458 and 460 adjacent the rear opening of the upper shell 428 (ribs only partially
shown.) The first rib, rib 458, extends around the rear opening. The second rib, rib 460, is
spaced inwardly of rib 458.
[000165]                     Fan 433, illustrated in Figures 44 and 44A, has a circular base 462. A hollow
boss 464 extends upwardly from the center of the base 462. While the fan base is circular, it is
not flat. Instead the base 462 curves upwardly to the hole formed by boss 464. When the
ventilation unit 274 is assembled, the fan 433 is fitted in the lower shell 428 for mounting to
the motor 434 the fan boss 464 seats over shell boss 436. The motor shaft mounts to the center
of the fan boss 464 (motor shaft securement means not illustrated.) Located around the outer
perimeter of base 462 are a number of arcuately spaced apart blades 466.
[000166]                     A ring 468 is disposed over the top surfaces of the blades 466. While in cross
section ring 468 is flat, the ring has a tapered profile. Thus the inner edge of the ring is located
above the outer edge. This change in lateral elevation of the ring 468 approximates the similar
rise in elevation of the fan base 362. This profile of having these surfaces rise to the center
approximates the curvature towards the center of the caudal portion of the skull. This is the
portion of the head over which the ventilation unit 274 is centered.
[000167]                     A grill unit 470, also part of ventilation unit 274, is disposed over the top of the
upper shell 430. As seen in Figure 45, the grill unit 470 includes a frame 472. The frame 472
generally has a shape similar to that of the lid. However, frame 472 is sized to fit wholly on
the outer surface of the upper shell lid 472. The frame, while formed from a set of flat strips of
plastic, is shaped so that the strips are tapered inwardly. Thus the outer edges of the individual
strips forming the frame are the surface of the grill unit 470 that seat against the adjacent outer
surface of the upper shell lid 450.

[000168]                      Formed integrally with frame 472 is a lattice 474. The lattice is formed from a
number of crossing webs. The lattice 474 extends over lid opening 453 and fan 433. Shown
extending downwardly from frame 472 are snap tabs 473. When ventilation unit 274 is
assembled snap tabs lock in openings 475 in the upper shell (Figure 43) to hold the grill unit to
the upper shell.
[000169]                      The motor cover 444, best seen in Figure 46, is fitted to the exposed under
surface of the lower shell base 432. Motor cover 444 has a main body 480 that, while sheet
like in shape, is curved along its longitudinal axis. Motor cover main body 480 is also curved
into the center of the longitudinal center axis. Again, this curvature approximates the curvature
of the portion of the skull over which the ventilation unit is typically seated. The front end of
the main body has a straight edge; the rear end has a curved profile between the side edges.
The motor cover 478 is further formed to have a lip 482 that extends upwardly from the outer
perimeter of the main body 480. More particularly, the lip 482 extends upwardly along the
side and rear edges of the cover body 480.
[000170]                      Four feet 484 interrupt the lip 482. Each foot 484 is generally L-shaped and
extends upwardly in the same direction as the lip 482. Each foot 484 extends from the cover
main body 480. Two of the feet 484 are located immediately behind the front edge of the
cover base 432. The remaining two feet 484 are located forward of the curved rear end. Each
foot 484 has an outwardly extending toe 486. Toes 486 extend above the outer edges of the
adjacent lip 482. Motor cover 444 is secured to the lower shell 428 by snap fitting toes 486 in
shell openings 442.
[000171]                      Motor cover 444 is further formed so that, one each side, forward the rear end
and rearward of the rear located feet 484, there is a gap 489 in the lip 482.
[000172]                      The motor cover main body 480 is formed with a slot 490 that extends along
the longitudinal axis of the body. Slot 490 starts at the front end of the body. The slot 490
terminates at a location forward of the rear end of the main body 480. Immediately rearward of
the front end of the main body 480, motor cover 444 is formed with two flexible fingers 492.
The fingers 492 are located diametrically opposite each other relative to slot 490. The finger

492 are formed integrally with the rest of the motor cover 444. Each finger 492 has a tip 494
that extends upwardly in the same direction as lip 482.
[000173]                      Ventilation unit 274 is partially suspended above the head of the wearer by arch
388. When head unit 270 is assembled, the upper end of the arch 388 is sandwiched between
the outer surface of the lower shell 428 and the motor cover 444. Fasteners, (not illustrated,)
hold the lower shell 428, and therefore the whole of the ventilation unit 274, to the arch. When
motor cover 444 is secured to the lower shell 428 the arch extends through the gaps 489 in the
cover lip 482.
[000174]                      An accordion-like rear bellows 498, seen in Figures 33 and 34, functions as the
conduit from the rear end opening of the ventilation unit 270 to the rear nozzle assembly 282.
At the ventilation unit end, rear bellows 498 extends through the generally oval shaped
opening formed by the ends of the lower and upper shells 428 and 430, respectively. The
forwardmost rib of the rear bellows 498 (rib not identified) is seated in the slot around this
opening defined by adjacent lower shell ribs 442 and 444 the aligned adjacent upper shell ribs
458 and 460.
[000175]                      The rear end of rear bellows 498 seats in the oval opening defined by the
adjoining top ends of the rear nozzle assembly shell trunk 322 and plate collar 378. The rear
most rib of the rear bellows 498 is seated in the slot around this opening defined by shell ribs
330 and 332 and adjacent collar ribs 384 and 386.
[000176]                      Front nozzle assembly 280 includes a pedestal 502 and a cap 504. The pedestal
502, seen best in Figure 47, includes a hollow post 506. Post 506 has a generally rectangular
cross sectional profile. The base of the post 506 is secured to the section of the face frame
support strap 294 immediately above the forehead band 288. Not shown are the fasteners used
to accomplish this securement.
[000177]                      Above post 506, pedestal 502 has a head 508. The head has a planar base 510
that extends outwardly from the front, back and sides of the pedestal. Side walls 512 that curve
upwardly from the opposed longitudinal sides of the base 510 complete the head 508. Two

ribs 514 and 516 extend inwardly from the inner surfaces of the base 510 and side walls 512.
Rib 514 is located around the rear end of the pedestal head 508. Rib 516 is parallel to and
located forward of rib 514.
[000178]                      Cap 504 seats over the pedestal head 508 to complete the front nozzle assembly
280. Referring to Figure 48, it can be seen that the cap 504 has a top panel 518 from which
two side panels 520 curve downwardly (one side panel shown). The cap 504 is further formed
so that the top panel 518 is curved along its longitudinal axis. When the front nozzle assembly
280 is put together, the cap side panels 520 abut the top edges of the pedestal head side walls
512.
[000179]                       The front nozzle assembly cap 504 is further shaped so that a rib 519 extends
along the longitudinal axis of the cap top panel 514. The rib 519 is formed so as have slots 521
that extend inwardly from the sides (one slot shown.) At the front end of the top panel 518, a
tab 524 extends upwardly. Tab 524 is thus located immediately in front of rib 519. A small
web 525 extends perpendicularly from tab 524 to the rib 519. Flange 525 is extends upwardly
from the longitudinal axis of the rib 519. Immediately behind tab 524, an elongated slot 523 is
formed in the rib 519.
[000180]                      While not illustrated, it should be appreciated that a pairs of ribs extend
inwardly from the inner surface of the cap top panel 518 and side panels 520. A first one of
these ribs abuts pedestal rib 514. The second cap rib abuts pedestal rib 516.
[000181]                      A front bellows 528 seen best in Figures 31 43 and 34, similar in structure to
rear bellows 498, serves as the conduit through which the forced air from the ventilation unit
274 is output to the front nozzle assembly 280. The rear most rib internal to front bellows seats
in the slot defined by lower shell ribs (not illustrated) and adjacent upper shell ribs 454 and
456. The front most rib internal to the front bellows 528 seats in the slot defined by pedestal
ribs 514 and 516 and the adjacent complementary ribs formed on the cap 504.
[000182]                      Support strap 294 assists in the suspension of the ventilation unit 274 above the
head of the wearer as now described by reference to Figures 29 and 31. Specifically, when the

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                            - 36
support strap 294 extends through the open front end of the motor cover 444 below the lower
shell 428. Returning to Figure 35, it is noted that the support strap is formed with two rows of
parallel openings 532. Openings 532 extend laterally across the support strap 294. The pairs of
openings 532 are spaced apart from each other longitudinally along the length of the strap.
[000183]                     When support strap 294 is positioned between the lower shell 428 and the
motor cover 444, finger tips 494 seat in a pair of opposed strap openings 532. This
engagement of the motor cover 444 to the support strap 294 serves to provide a front support
for the ventilation unit 274 above the head of the wearer.
[000184]                      Owing to the flexibility of the rear nozzle assembly arch 388, ventilation unit
274 is able to pivot around the rear attachment of the unit rear nozzle assembly 282. Motor
cover fingers 492 are flexible. This means the position of the ventilation unit 274 can be
selectively set to be relatively close to or spaced from the front nozzle assembly 280.
Collectively, this adjustability of the ventilation unit 274 means that the unit may be
positioned relative to the head of the wearer wherein it will least likely impose a strain on the
wearer.
[000185]                      Strain on the wearer is also reduced by the fact that the center of gravity of the
ventilation unit 274 is relatively close to the seventh cervical vertebra. This goal is
accomplished by shaping the components such as the lower shell 428, upper shell 430 fan 433,
motor cover 444 and grill unit 470 so that they extend downwardly from their centers. As
discussed above, this shaping approximates the back of the skull, the portion of the head
against which the ventilation unit is typically fitted.
[000186]                       Still another reason this invention minimizes strain on the wearer is that the
head unit is relatively light in weight. The head unit 270, include the head band 272, the
ventilation unit 274 the front nozzle assembly 280, the rear nozzle assembly 284 and face
frame 286 typically has a weight of less than 450 grams. In more preferred versions of the
invention, this assembly has a weight of less than 400 grams.
[000187]                     In regard to the minimization of this strain, experiments with head mounted

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                          - 37
equipment have shown that the strain is kept to the minimum if the center of mass is located
over the seventh cervical vertebra. Thus a wearer of this head unit 270 is able to configure the
unit so that the unit's center of mass is located as closely as possible positioned over this
landmark. Again this position can be accomplished regardless of the head size of the wearer.
[000188]                     Regardless of the adjustment of the size of the head band 272 and the
position/orientation of the ventilation unit 274 relative to the head band, the discharge opening
of the front nozzle assembly 280 remains at a fixed position relative to the forehead band 288.
This means the transparent shield, which is suspended from the front nozzle assembly,
remains a constant distance from the forehead band 288 and thus the face of the wearer.
Therefore, the air flow discharged from the front nozzle assembly remains a constant distance
away from the face of the wearer, regardless of the sizing of the head unit 270. This means the
front nozzle is positioned, regardless of head unit configuration, to ensure the discharge of air
is at the appropriate position relative to the wearer's face to ensure, there is proper purging of
C02 away from the face and delivery of relatively cool make up air.
[000189]                      Still another advantage with maintaining the front nozzle assembly 280 at a
relatively constant position in front of the face is associated with hood/toga placement. As
discussed below the hood/toga face shield 590 (Figure 52) is suspended from the front nozzle
assembly 280. Again since this assembly 280 is at relatively constant position relative to the
face, transparent shield 590 is likewise at a constant distance from the face. This means the
shield 590 can be located at a position so that regardless of head unit adjustment glare from
either the light 276 or ambient light is keep to a minimum.
[000190]                      Similarly, regardless of the adjustment of the head unit, the rear nozzle
assembly 282 remains essentially a constant distance from the neck of the wearer. This ensures
that air discharged from tip 318, regardless of head size and shape, optimally cool the neck.
[000191]                     Another advantage of so locating the transparent shield 590 essentially a
constant distance from the face is that the shield can be sized to ensure that regardless of head
size the field of view is essentially constant. In an ideal construction of the invention, no
aspect of the head unit and the hood/toga is within the field of view except the transparent

shield 590. This can reduce feelings of claustrophobia an individual may developing using the
system.
[000192]                       The support strap 294 is formed at the tail end thereof with a small
downwardly directed tab 295 (Figure 50). This tab extends through slot 490 formed in the
motor cover. The tab provides a visual indication of the extent to which the support strap 294
is extended into or retracted away from the ventilation unit 274.
[000193]                      As seen in Figure 49, the light 276 is a self contained unit that includes an LED
(not illustrated) or other light emitting element. Light 276 is pivotally mounted to a bracket
540 that is attached to forehead band 288. Specifically, the bracket 540 includes a flat base
542. Fasteners, (not illustrated,) hold the bracket base 542 to the face frame forehead band 288
immediately below support strap 294. Two arms 544 extend diagonally downward from base
542. The light is pivotally mounted to and between the free ends of the bracket arms 544.
[000194]                      A support wire 546 controls the up/down angle of the light 276. The wire
extends from a small tab 548 that is slidably mounted to the rib 519 on the top of the front
nozzle assembly. The tab 548 has feet (not illustrated) that sit in rib slots 521. The feet-in-slot
arrangement facilitates the friction fitting of the tab 548 along the length of the rib 519 so that
the tab can be slid to a left in position.
[000195]                      Wire 546 extends from tab 548 through cap opening 523 to the light unit 276.
The pivotal up/down position of the light 276 is set by adjusting the position of the tab 548
along the length of the front nozzle assembly 280.
[000196]                       As seen in Figure 50, a flex circuit 560 is mounted to the inner surface of the
face frame chin bar 292. Flex circuit 560 supports two lower power indicator LEDs 562 and
564 and a microphone 566. While not illustrated it should be understood that layered on the
flex circuit are the conductive traces that extend to the LEDs 562 and 564 and the microphone
566.
[000197]                      More particularly, returning to Figure 35, it can be seen that the face frame 286

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                          - 39
around the posts 290 and chin bar 292 has an inwardly directed lip 568. The flex circuit 560
has a main body 570 with generally rectangular shape. Three fingers 572 integral with the flex
circuit main body 570 extend upwardly from the main body at longitudinally spaced apart
locations along the upper side surface of the main body. The LEDs 562 and 564 are mounted
to the outer surface of the two outer flex circuit fingers 572. Each LED 562 and 564 extends
through a separate opening 574 formed in the face frame chin bar lip 568.
[000198]                      The microphone 566 is mounted to the center located flex circuit finger 572.
This finger 572 wraps around so as to overlap the flex circuit main body 570. A cap (not
illustrated) is fit over the chin bar 292 to cover the flex circuit. The microphone 566 extends
through an opening in this cap so as to be directed to the mouth of the wearer.
[000199]                      A first one of the LEDs, arbitrarily LED 562, performs the function of the
power monitor enunciator 234 (Figure 22). Thus LED 564 is illuminated whenever the power
monitoring circuit determines that the battery 562 is almost discharged.
[000200]                      The second LED, LED 564, and microphone 566 are associated with the
communications unit internal to the head unit 270. The microphone 566 converts the words
spoken by the wearer into electrical signals. The transceiver controller circuit 256 actuates
switch 258 to place the communications system in the "mute" mode.
[000201]                      Also mounted to chin bar 292 are the wearer actuated switches 578, 580 and
582, seen in Figure 51, for controlling the system. The switches 578, 580 and 582 are formed
from silicon rubber and have carbon contacts. A first one of the switches, switch 578, is
mounted in a first opening 584 defined by the chin bar 292. The remaining two switches 580
and 582 are mounted in a second chin bar opening 586.
[000202]                      Flex circuit main body 570 is disposed over the chin bar openings 584 and 586.
Formed on these surfaces of the flex circuit 560 are the conductive traces against which the
switch carbon contacts abut (contacts not shown.) A first one of the switches, switch 578,
performs the function of switch 258. This switch 578 is actuated to take the communications
system in and out of the mute mode. The remaining two switches are analogues to switches

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortbl\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                             - 40
 120 and 122. Switches 580 and 582 thus are depressed to regulate the speed of the ventilation
unit fan 278.
[000203]                      An advantage of the above placement of switches 578, 580 and 582 is that the
switches are immediately in front of the wearer. This makes it relatively easy for the wearer,
by moving a hand towards his/her head to actuate the switches. Thus, an individual wearing
this unit 270, for most definitions of a sterile field, does not have to move his/her hand out of
the field in order to actuate the switches.
[000204]                      Figure 52 illustrates the transparent shield 590 attached to a hood or toga used
with head unit 270. Shown as a dashed line is the position internal to the perimeter of the
shield 590 around which the sterile material-forming the hood or toga is secured to the shield
590. The top of the shield 590 is formed to have a tab 592. Tab 592 has a slot shaped opening
594. Opening 594 is rectangular in shape and on an axis parallel to the latitudinal, right-toleft
axis of the shield 590. The opening 594 further has an extension slot 595 that extends
upwardly. Extension slot 595 is centered on the longitudinal, up-to-down axis of the shield
590.
[000205]                      Shield 590 is formed to have two circular openings 596. Each opening 596 is
located adjacent a side edge of the shield 590 above the curved edge that functions as the
transition edge between the side edge and the shield bottom edge. Cuts 598 extend radially
from each opening 596. It is appreciated that openings 594 and 596 are located in the
perimeter section of the shield 590. This is the section of the shield that is covered by the
material forming the sterile hood or toga.
[000206]                      When the hood or toga is to be fitted to head unit 270, the shield is placed over
the head unit so that the tab 524 integral with the front nozzle assembly 280 is inserted in
shield opening 590. Front nozzle assembly web 525 seats in opening extension slot 595. This
seating of the shield 590 over the static tab 524 and web 525 serves to align the shield with the
outer components of the head unit 270 and prevent rotation of the aligned shield.
[000207]                      Shield 590 is then curved around the face frame 286. This flexing of the shield

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                            - 41
590 brings each of the shield openings 594 into alignment with a separate one of the face
frame pins 296. Shield openings 594 are smaller in diameter than heads 298 of the mounting
pins 296. Thus, at this time the shield 590 is snap fitted over pins 296. This engagement
secures the shield 590 and the associated hood or toga, to the head unit.
[000208]                       In this version of the invention, there is spacing of at least 3 cm between the
topmost attachment of the shield 590 to tab 524 and where the shield is attached to the two
laterally spaced apart pins 296. As a consequence of this arrangement, when the shield is fitted
to the head unit 270, the radius of curvature of the shield varies along the top to bottom
longitudinal axis. More particularly at the top of the shield, adjacent the tab, there is a
relatively wide diameter radius of curvature. Between pins 296 the shield has a smaller
diameter of curvature, a more pronounced curvature.
[000209]                     An advantage of this construction is that near eye level the less curved,
relatively flat, shield profile minimizes the amount glare. This arrangement also serves to
assist in the shield's suspension of the material forming the hood/toga away from the forehead
and top of the wearer's head. This feature provides a relatively large transparent shield-hood
free space around the top of the head. This reduces the effort required to fit auxiliary
equipment, such as a heads up display, a camera, other communication devices or lights
around the wearer's head.
[000210]                     Another advantage of this configuration of this invention is that openings 594
and 596 serve as the means integral with the shield 590 for holding the shield to the head unit
270. This arrangement eliminates the need to provide snap heads, magnets or hook-in-fabric
fastening strips to the hood/toga on the shield in order to facilitate the attachment of the shield
to the head unit. The elimination of these fastening members results in a like elimination of the
costs associated with providing the shield with these components.
VII.           ALTERNATIVE LIGHT, COMMUNICATIONS AND FAN UNIT
[000211]                     Figure 53 is a diagrammatic illustration of how a number of components of the
personal protection system 10 of this invention are, in some versions of the invention,
contained in a single housing 610. Housing 610 is configured to be worn someplace on the

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                           - 42
individual. For example, the housing 610 may include a clip (not illustrated) so it can be
attached to an article of clothing such as a belt. The housing 610 may alternatively include a
strap (not illustrated) so it can strapped to the individual.
[000212]                       Internal to the housing 610 is the power supply 70. Also integral with the
housing is the transceiver 242. A cable 612 that leads to head of the individual includes the
conductors that are connected to the microphone 238 and speaker 240. In these and other
versions of the invention, the microphone and speaker may be built into a head set separate
from the structure used to suspend the hood. Also disposed inside housing 610 is a fan 52a.
The majority of the airflow output by the fan is discharged through a flexible tube 614. Tube
614 is connected to the output vents in the body support structure from which the air should be
discharged.
[000213]                     A light generating unit 616 is also contained housing 610. The light generating
616 unit may contain an LED or an incandescent bulb such as a halogen bulb. A fiber optic
cable 618 extends from the light generating unit 616. The distal end of the fiber optic cable is
attached to the light emitting head 620 attached to the body support structure.
[000214]                     In this version of the invention, the outlet flow from the fan 52a is discharged
from two ports, (not shown). The proximal end of tube 614 is connected to one of the ports.
The second port leads to a duct 622 in the housing. Duct 622 is located between the face of the
sub housing 302 in which the light generating unit 616 that would be closest to the wearer of
the system 10 and the adjacent structural wall of the housing 610. Thus, the system is actuated
fan 52a continually blows new make-up air into duct 298. The air is discharged from exhaust
ports 624 formed in the side of the housing 610. This constant supply of this air minimizes the
extent to which the heat generated by the light generating unit 616 convectively warms the
housing 610 and the adjacent portion of the body of the wearer.
[000215]                     An advantage of this version of the invention is that he majority of the weight
of the active components of the personal protection system 10 are suspended from the waist or
other body part of the user where the presence of such weight does not induce significant
appreciable physical stress.

VIII.          ALTERNATIVE FEATURES
[000216]                     Body-worn support structures for suspending the hood other than the illustrated
and described helmet may be employed in this invention. One possible structure is a shoulder
mounted frame. This frame contains structural members for supporting the hood. This fan or
light generating unit may be directly mounted to this support structure. In versions of the
invention where both components are so mounted to the support structure, a duct is present to
circulate a fraction of the air discharged by the fan around the light generating unit.
Alternative embodiments of this version of the support structure of this invention may simply
have ducts for receiving the air and ports through which the air is discharged and a light
emitting head for emitting the light. In these versions of the invention the waist mounted unit
contains the fan and the light generating unit.
[000217]                     In some versions of the invention, the body support structure includes a vest
like garment worn about the trunk of the wearer. Integral with this garment are one more
supports from which the hood is suspended.
[000218]                     Also, in some versions of the invention, the support unit may include an
outwardly directed speaker. For example, this speaker could be mounted to flex circuit 560. In
these versions of the invention, there is also an amplifier capable of amplifying the signals
produced by microphone 566. These signals are broadcast by this speaker through the
hood/toga into the surrounding environment. This arrangement eliminates the need to provide
RF signal transceivers.
[000219]                     It may also be desirable to provide the transparent shield of the hood/toga with
at least one section that transmits sound. (Generally the material forming the transparent shield
absorbs or reflects sound.) Thus, the transparent shield could be formed an opening that is
generally aligned with the mouth of the wearer. This opening is covered with a section of the
sterile material from which the rest of the hood/toga is formed. This construction can eliminate
the need to provide any assembly for broadcasting or amplifying the speech of the wearer.
[000220]                     Alternatively the transparent shield opening may be covered with material that

C:\1nterwoven\NRPortb1\DCC\NZL\17251361.doex-29/06/2018
                                                            - 44
absorbs and retransmits sound waves. Electrometric materials such as a silicon rubber may
perform this function.
[000221]                     It should likewise be appreciated other duct assemblies may be provided to
direct air from the ventilation fan to the light generating unit. For example, there may be a duct
within either the front or rear nozzle assembly that leads directly to the light source. This duct
extends to a conduit, which may be flexible, that extends to the light source. In some versions
of the invention, this conduit opens into the inside of the housing of the light source. Thus, the
air passes directly over the heat generating, light emitting elements or heat sink elements
internal to the light source housing.
[000222]                     Alternatively, in some versions of this invention, the light source has its own
ventilation fan. This arrangement may be useful if it is necessary to flow large volumes of air
over the light source.
[000223]                     In either of the above versions of the invention, the light source maybe formed
with a conduit through which the air introduced into the source is exhausted. This conduit has
an exhaust port that opens away from the wearer.
[000224]                     It may also be desirable to position a temperature sensitive transducer adjacent
the heat generating components of the light source. The signal output by this sensor can be
used to regulate the light source and/or the fan that provides the air for cooling the light. Thus
when this sensor indicates the temperature adjacent the light source is rising to uncomfortable
levels, the current regulator 230 could respond by reducing the power supplied to the light.
When this condition is detected, alternatively, microcontroller 118 could step up the speed of
the fan so as to increase the air flow over the light source.
[000225]                       It should be appreciated that there are reasons other than wearer comfort for so
controlling the temperature of the light source and the space surrounding the source. This
excessive heating of the light source can appreciably diminish its useful life. In some
instances, the excessive heating of the source can cause its failure. Also, this heat, if not
exhausted, could potentially warm the user to the point at which the skin blisters or is burned.

                                                          -45
[000226]                       In some versions of the invention a heat pipe formed from thermally
conductive material extends from the light source. This heat pipe may extend to a duct that
extends from the fan.
[000227]                       An anti glare hood may be fitted over the light emitting head so as to extend
between the head and the inner surface of the transparent shield. The inner surface of this hood
is formed from light reflective or absorbing material. This arrangement reduces, if not
eliminates, the amount of light emitted by the head that is reflected by the inner surface of the
transparent shield back to the wearer as glare.
[000228]                     This hood may be formed from rigid or flexible material. One advantage of
employing flexible material is that it can ensure the hood abuts the inner surface of the
transparent shield when the shield is fitted to the helmet or head unit.
[000229]                      Some light systems may also be configured to provide the wearer with short
bursts of high intensity light. This light is provided in response to depression of a specific
control switch. The light burst may be provided in situations in which a very large amount of
light is required. Only a burst of light for a period between I to 10 minutes is provided. Only
the burst is provided so as to minimize the possibility this high driving of the light source
results in excessive heat being output or the source or the source being excessively operated to
the level at which it may burn out.
[000230]                     Devices other than the bellows may be employed as the adjustable conduits that
connect the ventilation unit 274 to the front and rear nozzle assemblies 280 and 284,
respectively. For example, telescoping tubes and/or tubes with flexilejoints may be employed
as these conduits.
[000231]                     Further, there is no requirement that in all versions of the invention two spaced
apart support members, support strap 294 and arch 394 both be provided to suspend the
ventilation unit 274 above the head band 272. In some versions of the invention, a single
support member or support post may be all that is required.

[000232]                      Also, in not all versions of the invention may it be necessary to attach the front
ventilation unit 280 to the head band 272. Thus, in some versions of the invention the
adjustable conduit that extends from the ventilation unit 274 to the front nozzle assembly 280
provides support for suspending the front nozzle assembly in a specific position relative to the
head band.
[000233]                      Further, there is no requirement that the all versions of the invention include
both the front and rear nozzle assemblies 280 and 282. Clearly most units will include the
front nozzle assembly.
[000234]                      While various embodiments of the present invention have been described
above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not
by way of limitation. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the relevant art that various
changes in form and detail can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of
the invention. Thus, the present invention should not be limited by any of the above described
exemplary embodiments.
