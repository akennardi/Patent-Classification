                           DESCRIPTION
                           A GLASS KETTLE
FIELD
The invention relates to an electrical kettle appliance, specifically
relates to a glass kettle.
BACKGROUND
Kettle is a normal home appliance, which is used for heating water.
It is normally consisted of base, kettle body and spout component.
The top and bottom of the body is connected with spout and base.
There is heating element within the base which is used to heat the
water in the body. The majority of the kettles in the market are single
layer borosilicate glass kettles with single layer of plastic or stainless
steel spout. When the single layer glass kettle contains hot liquid, the
heat would conduct to the surface through body and spout which
means the surface so hot that could cause scald. At the same time, it
reduces energy efficiency when heating or the rapid decrease of
temperature when keeping warm. These problems all presents the
room for further improvement.
CONTENT
This innovation is developed to overcome above defects of current
techniques by providing a glass kettle with simple structure and it

can be manufactured         simply. Adiabatic   cavity of the spout
component has outstanding thermal insulation effects, which can
prevent the scald during the use. Spout component includes the
kettle spout and decorative circumference. There is cavity on the
circumference of outer torus, and the decoration circumference is
installed on the circumference of outer torus. Altogether, it creates an
adiabatic cavity structure.
Further setting: the kettle body is fixedly connected to the lower end
of the spout component and includes a glass inner layer and a shell
disposed on the outer side of the glass inner layer. The glass inner
layer and the outer shell are arranged at intervals to form a heat
insulation layer.
Further setting: the lower end surface of the spout is provided with
two fixing ribs arranged around the periphery of the spout portion,
namely a first fixing rib and a second fixing rib. The first fixing rib
and the second fixing rib form an interval called the first fixing
groove. The first fixing rib on the outside and the decorative
circumference cooperate to form the second fixing groove, and the
upper end of the glass inner shell and the upper end of the outer shell
are respectively located in the first fixing groove and the second
fixing groove.
Further setting: a plurality of hooks are disposed on an outer side of
the first fixing rib, and fitting grooves or matching holes that
matches the hooks is disposed on the outer shell.

Further setting: the outer shell is provided with a concession ring at a
predetermined position at the upper end, the fitting groove or the
matching hole is arranged on the concession ring surface, and the
decoration circumference is arranged around the concession ring
surface and covers the fitting groove or the fitting hole.
Further setting: the spout component further comprises a limiting
connecting ring, the limiting connecting ring is fixedly connected to
the inner annular surface of the lower end of the spout component, or
is fixedly connected to the inner side of the lower end of the
decoration circumference;
A first annular groove with a notch facing downwards is arranged
between the outer side edge and the inner side edge of the limiting
connection ring. The outer side wall of the limiting connection ring
and the inner annular surface of the spout component or inner side of
the decoration circumference forms a second annular groove with
the notch facing downwards;
The upper end of the glass inner layer and the upper end of the outer
shell are respectively located in the first annular groove and the
second annular groove.
Compared with the prior technique, the utility model has a simple
structure, a double-layer structure is adopted for the kettle body and

the spout component, a heat-insulated cavity is arranged between the
spout component of the spout component and the decorative
circumference, and also between the glass inner layer and the outer
shell of the kettle body. Because of the insulation cavity, the whole
electric kettle has better thermal insulation and heat preservation
effect, which avoids the kettle from being too hot during use; at the
same time, the outer shell can protect the glass layer while The
connection     structure between the kettle body and the spout
component is reliable and easy to install.
