EXAMINER ABSTRACT
A bag for a large SLR Camera, which is thermally insulated, comprises an aluminium plate mounted
in a bottom part, a 24 to 12V regulator and 20W heater mounted under the plate and a laptop
power supply.

Problem
When heavy objects with high thermal inertia are moved from a cool environment into a warm
environment, condensation can form on all of the cool surfaces.
This is especially problematic with large SLR Cameras and their lenses which become unusable until
all surfaces have warmed to ambient and the condensation has evaporated (Up to 1.5 Hours).
This condensation can also leave smears on the lens surfaces and can also cause the growth of mold.
This can be cleaned from external surfaces but can cause permanent damage to inner surfaces
including lenses, sensors, mirrors, prisms etc.
This situation occurs most frequently in tropical climates where the device is stored in an air
conditioned environment (typically 22 Degrees) and then taken outside to a warm, humid
environment.
Solution
If the device is stored at a temperature at or above the Dew Point (rarely more than 28 Degrees)
there will be no condensation on the device when moved to the outside environment.

Background
Summary of Invention
Technical Problem
Large SLR Cameras and their lenses can become unusable for up to 1.5 Hours when moved from an
air conditioned environmentuntil all surfaces have warmed to ambient and the condensation has
evaporated (Up to 1.5 Hours).
*        This condensation can also leave smears on the lens surfaces and can also cause the growth
of mold.
