FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002] The present invention relates to femoral heads, mobile inserts, acetabular components, and
modular junctions for orthopedic implants and methods of using femoral heads, mobile inserts,
acetabular components, and modular junctions for orthopedic implants.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003] Dislocation of the hip joint is a major cause of failure in hip arthroplasty. The reported
incidences of hip dislocations range from 0.5% to 5.8% for primary surgeries and from 4.8% to 13%
for revision surgeries. (See Burroughs et al. "Range Of Motion And Stability In Total Hip
Arthroplasty With 28-, 32-, 38-, and 44-mm Femoral Head Sizes," JArthroplasty 2005 Jan, 20(1):11
9.) Additionally, a large proportion (30% to 65%) of these dislocations become recurrent. (See
previously mentioned Burroughs et al.) To reduce the risk against hip dislocations, large diameter
(greater than about 32mm) femoral heads and mating acetabular components are used in a variety of
hip arthroplasty implants such as total hip implants, resurfacing hip implants, and dual mobility (DM)
hip implants.
[0004] As shown in FIG. 1, a conventional total hip implant is generally composed of an acetabular
shell 10 that mounts on the native pelvic bone and replaces the native acetabulum, an acetabular liner
12 affixed immovably to the acetabular shell 10, a prosthetic femoral head 14 that replaces the native
femoral head, and a femoral stem 16 that attaches to the prosthetic femoral head 14 via a femoral neck
18. Some hip arthroplasty implants, such as metal-on-metal implants and resurfacing implants, do not
have an acetabular liner, and the femoral head articulates directly with the acetabular shell. FIGS. 2A
                                                  -1-

    WO 2014/052768                                                                  PCT/US2013/062203
and 2B illustrate conventional large diameter femoral heads used in hip resurfacing (FIG. 2A) and
total hip implants (FIG. 2B). The femoral head diameter equals 2*R, where R is a radius of an overall
spherical geometry 22 of the femoral heads. Prosthetic femoral heads with diameters of about 32mm
or greater are defined as large diameter, and this diameter is close to that of the patient's native
femoral head. In contrast, femoral heads with diameters of about 28mm or less are defined as small
diameter, and this diameter is smaller than that of the native femoral head.
[0005] As shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, a conventional dual mobility hip implant is generally
composed of an acetabular shell 24, a mobile insert 26, and a small diameter femoral head 28 attached
to a femoral stem 30. The acetabular shell 24 mounts on the native pelvic bone and replaces the
native acetabulum, and the femoral stem 30 attaches to the femoral head 28 via a femoral neck 32.
An outer surface of the mobile insert 26 articulates with the acetabular shell 24 to form an outer
articulation. An inner surface of the mobile insert 26 articulates with the small diameter head 28
retained within the insert 26 to form an inner articulation. An outer diameter of the mobile insert 26 is
typically about 36mm or greater. In contrast, the femoral head 28 retained within the mobile insert 26
typically has a diameter of about 28mm or less. The larger diameter (2*R) outer articulation between
the acetabular shell 24 and the mobile insert 26 provides stability against dislocation and provides
large range of motion. The small diameter (2*R) inner articulation between the mobile insert 26 and
the femoral head 28 provides a low wear articulation. Extraction or dislocation of the small diameter
head 28 from the inner articulation is prevented by retention of the head 28 within the mobile insert
26. This retention is achieved by having the inner articular surface of the mobile insert 26 designed to
cover and capture more than a hemispherical portion of the femoral head. Parameter       Pin FIGS. 2A
and 2B characterizes an angular extent of an outer articular surface 30 of a femoral head, and
parameter   Pin FIG. 4 characterizes  an angular extent of an outer articular surface 32 of a mobile
insert.
[0006] While large diameter femoral heads and mobile inserts provide increased resistance to hip
dislocation, one of the concerns with conventional designs is the potential impingement against native
soft tissues, such as the hip capsule and the iliopsoas muscle/tendon (see FIGS. 5A, 5B, 6A, and 6B).
Impingement of these soft tissues can lead to severe groin pain. FIG. 5A shows that the iliopsoas
tendon 34 in the native hip passes over the native femoral head 36 and femoral neck 38 to insert into
the lesser trochanter 40. FIG. 5B shows that the iliopsoas tendon 42 articulating against the native
femoral head 44 in a cadaver human hip joint (see Yoshio et. al. "The Function Of The Psoas Major
Muscle: Passive Kinetics And Morphological Studies Using Donated Cadavers," J Orthop Sci. 2002,
7:199-207). Arrow 43 indicates a location of iliopsoas articulation against the native femoral head 44.
FIGS. 6A and 6B show a conventional large diameter femoral head or mobile insert 46 mounted on a
computer tomography (CT) based bone model of a cadaver specimen including a femur 47 and a
                                                    -2-

    WO 2014/052768                                                                  PCT/US2013/062203
pelvis 49. The articular surface of the prosthetic femoral head or mobile insert can be seen in FIGS.
6A and 6B to overhang 48 the articular surface of the native femoral head, particularly in the anterior
distal / anterior-medial and posterior-distal/posterior-medial regions. Acetabular shells and acetabular
liners have been proposed to address potential soft tissue impingement. (See US Pat. Pub. No.
2005/0060040 filed September 9, 2004 entitled "Prosthetic Acetabular Cup And Prosthetic Femoral
Joint Incorporating Such A Cup," Intl. Pat. No. WO 2009118673 filed March 20, 2009 entitled
"Cotyloidal Prosthesis Of The So-Called 'Dual Mobility' Type," US Pat. Pub. No. 2011/0301654
filed July 29, 2011 entitled "Hip Resurfacing," and US Pat. No. 7,169,186 filed May 15, 2002 entitled
"Monopolar Constrained Acetabular Component.")
 [0007] Another complication relating to use of large diameter femoral heads and mobile inserts is
increased wear and/or frictional torque at the femoral head-acetabular articulation or mobile insert
acetabular articulation. (See Lachiewicz et al. "Femoral Head Size and Wear of Highly Cross-linked
Polyethylene at 5 to 8 Years," Clin Orthop Relat Res. 2009 December, 467(12): 3290-3296;
Livermore et al. "Effect of Femoral Head Size on Wear of the Polyethylene Acetabular Component,"
J Bone Joint Surg Am. 1990 Apr, 72-A: 518-528.)
 [0008] Yet another complication of using large diameter femoral heads and mobile inserts is
increased risk of failure of the modular junctions used in many modern hip implants. Such modular
junctions are used for increased flexibility in matching a patient's anatomy and achieving optimal
component positioning (see, e.g., a modular taper junction 20 of FIG. 1). A modular femoral head
neck junction, for example, implies that the femoral head is a separate component that is assembled
onto the femoral neck. As shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, conventional modular junctions of a femoral
head 52 and a femoral neck 54 are typically conical taper junctions 50, with a small diameter circular
profile dl at one end of the taper junction 50 that increases in size to a circular profile of diameter d2
at an opposite end of the taper junction 50. A parameter L represents a length of the taper junction 50
measured along a taper junction axis 50A, and a parameter k represents a conical angle of mating
surfaces of the taper junction 50. In a conventional femoral head-neck taper junction, the taper
junction axis is generally also parallel to the prosthetic femoral neck axis, as in FIGS. 7A and 7B.
 [0009] Recent studies have shown that taper junctions are susceptible to corrosion due to
micromotion at the mating surfaces. (See Lieberman et al. "An Analysis Of The Head-Neck Taper
Interface In Retrieved Hip Prostheses," Clin Orthop Relat Res. 1994 Mar, (300):162-7; Rehmer et al.
"Influence Of Assembly Procedure And Material Combination On The Strength Of The Taper
Connection At The Head-Neck Junction Of Modular Hip Endoprostheses," Clin Biomech. 2012 Jan,
27(1):77-83.)    This in turn can lead to loosening of the modular junction and create undesirable metal
debris. Hip implants with large diameter femoral heads and mobile inserts are particularly susceptible
to this due to the increased lever arm and implant diameter, which can lead to greater frictional torque
                                                    -3-

    WO 2014/052768                                                                 PCT/US2013/062203
and moment loads at the junction. (See Meyer et al. "Corrosion at the Cone/Taper Interface Leads to
Failure of Large-diameter Metal-on-metal Total Hip Arthroplasties," Clin Orthop Relat Res. 2012
Aug 3. [Epub ahead of print]; Langton et al. "Taper Junction Failure In Large-Diameter Metal-On
Metal Bearings". Bone Joint Res. 2012 Sep, 1(4): 56-63.)
[0010] Accordingly, there remains a need for improved orthopedic implants.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0011] The present invention relates to femoral heads, mobile inserts, acetabular components, and
modular junctions for orthopedic implants and methods of using femoral heads, mobile inserts,
acetabular components, and modular junctions for orthopedic implants.
[0012] In one aspect, an orthopedic implant is provided that in one embodiment includes a femoral
head implant that includes a peripheral portion of an outer surface thereof that is contoured so as to
achieve an inward shift of the outer surface relative to an overall spherical geometry of the femoral
head implant. The inward shift is achieved through a change in radius of curvature, the radius of
curvature being one or more convex radii. The inward shift is axisymmetric around a femoral head
axis of the femoral head implant and occurs at an angle greater than about 800 and less than about
115'. The inward shift is at least about 1mm at a location of maximum inward shift.
[0013] In another embodiment, an orthopedic implant includes a femoral head implant having a
portion of an outer surface thereof that is contoured so as to achieve an inward shift of the outer
surface relative to an overall spherical geometry of the femoral head implant. The inward shift
reduces at least one of soft tissue impingement and frictional torque.
[0014] The orthopedic implant can vary in any number of ways. For example, the inward shift of the
outer surface relative to an overall spherical geometry of the femoral head implant can be achieved
through a change in radius of curvature, the radius of curvature including one or more of convex radii,
concave radii, and chamfers. For another example, the inward shift of the outer surface relative to an
overall spherical geometry of the femoral head implant can be achieved through a change in center of
curvature. For yet another example, the inward shift of the outer surface relative to an overall
spherical geometry of the femoral head implant can be achieved through creation of grooves, cut-outs,
or recesses. For still another example, the inward shift of the outer surface relative to an overall
spherical geometry of the femoral head implant can be axisymmetric around a femoral head axis of
the femoral head implant. The portion can be a peripheral portion, and the inward shift of the outer
surface relative to an overall spherical geometry of the femoral head implant can be at least about
1mm at a location of maximum inward shift, the inward shift of the outer surface relative to an overall
spherical geometry of the femoral head implant can occur at the angle, the inward shift of the outer
surface relative to an overall spherical geometry of the femoral head implant can be achieved using
                                                   -4-

    WO 2014/052768                                                                PCT/US2013/062203
one or more of convex radii, concave radii, and chamfers, the inward shift of the outer surface can be
achieved using a convex radius or convex radii that immediately follow a non-contoured surface, the
inward shift of the outer surface can be configured to approach edges of a taper junction, and/or the
inward shift of the outer surface can be configured to merge with an extended portion of a taper
junction. The convex radius or convex radii can be followed by concave radii or chamfers, or a
combination of one or more concave radii and chamfers. For another example, the inward shift of the
outer surface relative to an overall spherical geometry of the femoral head implant can be non
axisymmetric around a femoral head axis of the femoral head implant. The inward shift of the outer
surface can be configured to occur over a limited range of azimuth angle measured around a femoral
head axis of the femoral head implant, thereby leading to creation of at least one of localized cut-outs
and localized recesses. The inward shift of the outer surface can be axisymmetric about another axis
that is at not coincident with the femoral head axis. The inward shift of the outer surface relative to an
overall spherical geometry of the femoral head implant can be achieved using one or more of convex
radii, concave radii, and chamfers.
 [0015] In another embodiment, an orthopedic implant includes a femoral head implant having a
portion of an outer surface that has varying angular extent as a function of azimuth angle measured
around a femoral head axis of the femoral head implant.
 [0016] In another embodiment, an orthopedic implant includes a femoral head implant having
portions of an outer surface that are removed so as to reduce a contact area with a mating surface, the
mating surface including an articular surface of an acetabular component.
 [0017] In another embodiment, an orthopedic implant includes a femoral head implant has portions
of an outer surface that are removed by texturing so as to reduce a contact area with a mating surface.
The mating surface can include an articular surface of an acetabular component.
 [0018] The orthopedic implant can vary in any number of ways. For example, the outer surface can
be textured so as to reduce the contact area with the mating surface.
 [0019] In another embodiment, an orthopedic implant includes a mobile insert that includes a portion
of an inner or outer surface thereof that is contoured so as to achieve an inward shift of the inner or
outer surface relative to an overall spherical geometry of the mobile insert, thereby reducing at least
one of soft tissue impingement and frictional torque.
 [0020] The orthopedic implant can vary in any number of ways. For example, the inward shift of the
inner or outer surface relative to the overall spherical geometry of the mobile insert can be achieved
through a change in radius of curvature. The radius of curvature can include one or more of convex
radii, concave radii, and chamfers. For another example, the inward shift of the inner or outer surface
                                                    -5-

    WO 2014/052768                                                                PCT/US2013/062203
relative to the overall spherical geometry of the mobile insert can be achieved through a change in
center of curvature. For yet another example, the inward shift of the inner or outer surface relative to
the overall spherical geometry of the mobile insert can be achieved through creation of grooves, cut
outs or recesses.
[0021] In another embodiment, an orthopedic implant includes a mobile insert having a portion of an
inner or outer surface thereof that has varying angular extent as a function of azimuth angle measured
around a mobile insert axis of the mobile insert.
[0022] In another embodiment, an orthopedic implant includes a mobile insert, A range of
permissible motion between the mobile insert and one of an acetabular component and a femoral head
is different along one direction compared to a range of permissible motion in another direction.
[0023] In another embodiment, an orthopedic implant includes a mobile insert in which portions of
an inner or outer surface of the mobile insert are removed sp as to reduce a contact area with a mating
surface. The mating surface includes an articular surface of a femoral head or of an acetabular
component.
[0024] The orthopedic implant can vary in any number of ways. For example, the inner or outer
surface can be textured so as to reduce contact area with the mating surface.
[0025] In another aspect, a modular taper junction is provided that in one embodiment is configured
to connect together a plurality of separate components forming an orthopedic implant. The modular
taper junction can include a first component with an inner surface, and a second component with an
outer surface. The inner surface of the first component and the outer surface of the second component
can have non-circular cross-sectional geometry in a plane perpendicular to a taper junction axis of the
modular taper junction. The first component can include a cavity.
[0026] In another embodiment, a modular taper junction configured to connect together a plurality of
separate components forming an orthopedic implant can include a first component with an inner
surface, and a second component with an outer surface. A portion of at least one of the first and
second components can be composed of one or more shape memory materials. The first component
can include a cavity.
[0027] In another embodiment, a modular taper junction configured to connect together a plurality of
separate components forming an orthopedic implant can include a first component with an inner
surface, a second component with an outer surface, and a sleeve with an inner surface and an opposite
outer surface. The sleeve can be composed at least partially of one or more shape memory materials,
and the sleeve can be interposed between the inner surface of the first component and the outer
                                                   -6-

    WO 2014/052768                                                                PCT/US2013/062203
surface of the second component. The outer surface of the sleeve can be configured to mate with the
inner surface of the first component, and the inner surface of the sleeve can be configured to mate
with the outer surface of the second component. The first component can include a cavity.
[0028] In another embodiment, a modular taper junction configured to connect together a plurality of
separate components forming an orthopedic implant can include a first component with an inner
surface and a second component with an outer surface. At least one of the inner surface of the first
component and the outer surface of the second component can have a part positive and part negative
taper angle. The part positive and negative taper angles can be angled in an opposite directions
relative to a taper junction axis of the modular taper junction. The first component can include a

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[00157] Certain exemplary embodiments will now be described to provide an overall understanding of
the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the devices and methods disclosed
herein. One or more examples of these embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.
Those skilled in the art will understand that the devices and methods specifically described herein and
illustrated in the accompanying drawings are exemplary embodiments and that the scope of the
present invention is defined solely by the claims. The features illustrated or described in connection
with one exemplary embodiment may be combined with the features of other embodiments. Such
modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.
The definitions of various terms used to describe the present invention are provided below.
[00158] DEFINITIONS
[00159] The term "native" is used herein to imply natural or naturally occurring in the body.
Examples of native structures include musculoskeletal structures such as the pelvic bone (or pelvis),
femoral bone (or femur), tendon, muscle, ligament, joint capsule, etc. For example, what is meant by
"native femoral head" is the natural anatomical structure that resides at a proximal end of a femur.
[00160] The term "implant" is used herein to refer to a prosthetic component designed to augment or
replace one or more native structures of the body. For example, an orthopedic implant refers to a
prosthetic component designed to augment or replace one or more native musculoskeletal structures
of the body.
[00161] The term "modular junction" used herein refers to a portion of an implant that marks an
interface between discrete implant components and is designed to rigidly hold the components
together. The term "taper junction" is used herein to refer to a modular junction composed of a first
component with an inner surface (e.g., a female taper surface) that mates with an outer or exterior
                                                   - 17 -

    WO 2014/052768                                                                 PCT/US2013/062203
surface of a second component (e.g., a male taper surface) The term "conical taper junction" as used
herein refers to a taper junction where mating surfaces thereof have a conical geometry composed of a
small diameter circular profile at one end of the junction that increases in size to a larger diameter
circular profile at another, opposite end of the junction. Such conical taper junctions are also referred
to as taper, morse taper, morse taper junction, trunnion, taper connection, etc. The term "taper
junction axis" as used herein refers to a line joining geometric centers of two ends of a taper junction.
For example, in a conical taper junction, the taper junction axis is a line joining centers of circular
profiles at two ends of the junction. An "extended portion" of a taper junction refers herein to a
portion a prosthetic component that extends beyond a main body of the prosthesis and includes a
surface (male or female taper surface) of the taper junction. For example, in a femoral head implant, a
female taper surface is generally formed by an inner surface of a cavity within a main spherical/semi
spherical body of the femoral head. However, in some femoral head implants, a cylindrical protrusion
extends from a base of the femoral head. In this implant, the female taper surface extends from the
cavity in the main spherical body of the femoral head to a cavity in this cylindrical protrusion. In this
case, the cylindrical protrusion containing the female taper surface is referred to as an extended
portion of a taper junction.
 [00162] The terms "articulate," "articulation," and "articulating" are used herein to indicate a
possibility of relative motion between mating surfaces. For prosthetic components, such relative
motion is intended or part of the design intent. For example, the phrase "component A articulates with
component B" indicates that relative motion can occur between component A and component B at the
mating surface/s or interface/s. In some embodiments, an amount of relative motion at the articulating
surfaces can be less than about 1 mm. In other embodiments, the amount of relative motion can be
larger than about 1 mm, e.g., larger than about 2 mm, larger than about 5 mm, larger than about
 10mm, etc.
 [00163] The term "articular surface" as used herein refers to a portion of a native musculoskeletal
structure or a prosthetic component where relative motion (or articulation) can occur in relation to
another native structure or prosthetic component.
 [00164] The term "femoral head" or "head" as used herein refers to either a ball-shaped top of the
native femoral bone that forms part of the native hip joint, or a prosthetic component or a portion of a
prosthetic component designed to replace or augment the native femoral head or a portion of the
native femoral head. In some embodiments, a prosthetic femoral head is in the form of a cap
configured to primarily replace an outer surface of a native femoral head, and thereby minimize
amount of bone removal required to affix the component to the native femur. In other embodiments, a
prosthetic femoral head is spherical, semi-spherical, or ball-like. In yet other embodiments, the
prosthetic femoral head is configured to replace the native femoral head. The prosthetic femoral head
                                                    - 18 -

    WO 2014/052768                                                                PCT/US2013/062203
may be affixed to the native femur through a prosthetic femoral-neck and/or a prosthetic femoral
stem. The prosthetic femoral head and femoral neck may be portions of a single implant (monoblock
component) or may be separate/discrete components. The interface between a prosthetic femoral head
and femoral neck may be a modular junction (femoral head-neck junction), such as a conical taper
junction.
 [00165] The term "femoral neck" or "neck" as used herein refers to either a portion of the native
femur between the native femoral head and native femoral shaft (femoral body), or a prosthetic
component or a portion of a prosthetic component that joins a prosthetic femoral head to the native
femur or to a prosthetic femoral stem. The prosthetic femoral neck and femoral stem may be portions
of a single implant (monoblock component) or may be separate/discrete components. The interface
between a prosthetic femoral neck and femoral stem maybe a modular junction (femoral neck-stem
junction), such as a conical taper junction.
 [00166] The term "femoral neck axis" as used herein refers to an axis that is parallel to an axis of a
cylindrical approximation of the femoral neck. The native femoral neck axis also passes through the
center of the native femoral head. In conventional implants, the prosthetic femoral neck axis typically
passes through the prosthetic femoral head center, and under ideal surgical placement the prosthetic
femoral neck axis is expected to be parallel to the native femoral neck axis. However, in a number of
surgical cases, the prosthetic femoral neck axis may not be parallel to the native femoral neck axis.
 [00167] The term "femoral stem" or "stem" as used herein refers to a prosthetic component or a
portion of a prosthetic component with an elongated distal end designed to be affixed to the native
femur such as within the intra-medullary canal of the native femur.
 [00168] The term "acetabulum" refers to the cup shaped cavity of the native pelvis that receives the
native femoral head and forms a part of the native hip joint.
 [00169] The term "acetabular component" as used herein refers to a prosthetic component configured
to replace or augment the native acetabulum or a portion of the native acetabulum. The acetabular
component can be composed of one or more sub-components such as an acetabular shell, an
acetabular liner, and a mobile insert. The term "acetabular shell" as used herein refers to a prosthetic
component whose outer surface is configured to be affixed immovably to the native acetabulum.
When the acetabular shell mates with the native acetabulum, there can be limited relative motion
between the two bodies. Typically, this limited relative motion is called micromotion and is on the
order of about 1 mm or less. An inner/interior surface of the acetabular shell can articulate with the
native femoral head, or it can articulate with a prosthetic femoral head, or mate with an acetabular
liner, or articulate with a mobile insert. When the acetabular shell mates with an acetabular liner, there
can be limited relative motion between the two bodies. Typically, this limited relative motion is called

immovably to the pelvic bone through various methods such as screws, bone cement, ingrowth of
bone into the component surface, etc., or the acetabular shell be held in place by compressive forces
in the hip joint. The term "acetabular liner" as used herein refers to a prosthetic component whose
outer surface is configured to be affixed immovably to an inner surface of another acetabular
component (e.g., an acetabular shell). An inner surface of the acetabular liner can be configured to
articulate with a prosthetic femoral head, articulate with the native femoral head, mate with another
acetabular liner, or articulate with a mobile insert. When the acetabular liner mates with another
acetabular liner, there can be limited relative motion between the two bodies. Typically, this limited
relative motion is called micromotion and is on the order of about 1 mm or less.
[00170] The acetabular liner can be rigidly fixed to the acetabular shell by various methods such as
screws, locking mechanisms, capture mechanisms etc., or the acetabular liner can be held in place by
compressive forces in the hip joint. The acetabular liner and acetabular shell can be a single
monoblock component.
[00171] Monoblock components, such as an acetabular liner and acetabular shell combination, can be
created via assembly process at an implant manufacturing facility. The term "mobile insert" or
"insert" as used herein refers to a prosthetic component whose outer surface is configured to articulate
with the inner surface of the native acetabulum, an acetabular shell, or an acetabular liner. An inner
surface of the mobile insert can be configured to articulate with a prosthetic femoral head, to articulate
with the native femoral head, to articulate with another mobile insert, or to mate with an acetabular
liner. Thus, the term "mobile insert" as defined and used herein refers to a prosthetic component
having an inner articular surface and an outer articular surface.
[00172] The term "overall spherical geometry" is used herein in relation to a surface of a prosthetic
component, such as a femoral head or an acetabular component, or a surface of a native structure,
such as the native femoral head or acetabulum. The term "overall spherical geometry" as used herein
refers to a sphere of minimum radius that can fully encompass the surface and is tangent to the surface
at a polar location (or pole or apex). A radius of the sphere is referred to as an "overall spherical
radius." For example, an overall spherical geometry of an outer surface of a femoral head is a sphere
of minimum radius that can fully encompass the surface and is tangent to the surface at a polar
location. An articular surface of a conventional prosthetic femoral head or a mobile insert is typically
more than a hemi-spherical portion of its overall spherical geometry. A femoral head diameter or head
diameter typically equals two times the overall spherical radius of its outer articular surface. Similarly
a mobile insert outer diameter typically equals two times the overall spherical radius of its outer
articular surface.
[00173] The term "femoral head rim" as used herein refers to an edge or surface marking an end of a

femoral head articular surface. A prosthetic femoral head rim can also mark the transition from the
femoral head articular surface to a modular junction. Once the prosthetic components are implanted,
the prosthetic femoral head rim can mark transition from prosthetic femoral head to native femoral
head, prosthetic femoral head to native femoral neck, or prosthetic femoral head to prosthetic femoral
neck. The native femoral head rim marks an end of the native femoral head articular surface and
transition to the native femoral neck.
[00174] The term "mobile insert rim" as used herein refers to an edge or surface marking an end of the
inner or outer articular surface of the mobile insert, and marks the opening to an inner cavity or inner
surface of the mobile insert.
[00175] The term "acetabular rim" as used herein refers to an edge or surface of an acetabular
component (liner or shell) that marks an end of an inner or outer surface of the acetabular component.
[00176] The term "femoral head axis" as used herein refers to a line passing through a center of an
overall spherical geometry of a femoral head, and to a geometric center of a femoral head rim of the
femoral head. Typically, the femoral head axis also passes through a polar location or pole or apex of
the femoral head. The native femoral head axis is coincident with the native femoral neck axis. In
conventional implants, the femoral head axis is typically parallel to the prosthetic femoral neck axis,
and under ideal surgical placement the femoral head axis is expected to be parallel to the native
femoral neck axis.
[00177] The term "mobile insert axis" as used herein refers to a line passing through a center of an
overall spherical geometry of a mobile insert, and to a geometric center of a mobile insert rim of the
mobile insert. Typically, the mobile insert axis also passes through a polar location or pole or apex of
the mobile insert. In conventional implants, at neutral orientation and under ideal surgical placement,
the mobile insert axis is typically parallel to the prosthetic femoral neck axis, and expected to be
parallel to the native femoral neck axis.
[00178] The term "peripheral" as used herein refers to a portion of a prosthetic component adjacent to
a prosthetic rim of the prosthetic component. For example, a peripheral portion of a femoral head or
mobile insert refers to a portion of the femoral head or mobile insert which is adjacent to the femoral
head rim or mobile insert rim, respectively.
[00179] The term "non-peripheral" as used herein refers to a portion of a prosthetic component which
is not adjacent to a prosthetic rim of the prosthetic component. For example, a non-peripheral portion
of a femoral head or mobile insert refers to a portion of the femoral head or mobile insert which is not
adjacent to the femoral head rim or mobile insert rim, respectively.

[00180] A native structure or prosthetic component is described as being "axisymmetric" about an
axis, as used herein, if cross-sections of the native structure or prosthetic component taken in a plane
coincident with the axis have identical geometries at any location of the cross-sectional plane around
the axis. Herein, the phrase "around the axis" implies in the direction of revolution about the axis,
such as along a rim or circumference of the prosthetic component or native structure.
[00181] A native structure or prosthetic component is described as being "non-axisymmetric" about
an axis, as used herein, if cross-sections of the native structure or prosthetic component taken in a
plane coincident with the axis have non-identical geometries at different angular locations of the
cross-sectional plane around the axis. Herein, "around the axis" implies in the direction of revolution
about the axis, such as along a rim or circumference of the prosthetic component or native structure.
[00182] The term "angular extent," as used herein, characterizes an extent of a surface of a prosthetic
component or a native structure such as an articular surface of a femoral head or mobile insert. In a
femoral head or mobile insert, the angular extent is measured in a plane coincident with a femoral
head axis or mobile insert axis and is an angle between the axis and a line joining a center of an
overall spherical geometry of a surface to an end point of the surface.
[00183] The term "contoured" is used herein to refer to a surface that is shaped, formed, designed or
fashioned in a specific manner as disclosed herein. The term "contouring" is used herein to refer to a
process of shaping, forming, designing, or fashioning a surface in a specific manner. Such contouring
can take the form of a change in radius, a change in center of curvature, creation of grooves, creation
of cut-outs, creation of recesses, carving or trimming of the surface, etc. The term "non-contoured"
when used in reference to a surface of a femoral head or mobile insert implies that the surface has a
spherical geometry matching that of an overall spherical geometry of the head or insert.
[00184] The term "inwards" as used herein means toward the inside or toward the interior, such as
toward or closer to a center of an overall spherical geometry. For example, a portion of an outer
surface of a prosthetic femoral head can be contoured to move the surface inwards relative to an
overall spherical geometry of the implant. This implies that a portion of the outer surface of the
femoral head is moved toward an interior of the femoral head and closer to a geometric center of the
overall spherical geometry. The term "inward shift" is used herein in relation to a surface of an
implant contoured to move a surface inwards relative to an overall spherical geometry of the implant,
and refers to a radial distance between the contoured surface and the overall spherical geometry. This
radial distance is measured along a radial line of the overall spherical geometry.
[00185] The term "theta angle" refers to an angle between a line joining a center of an overall
spherical geometry of a femoral head or mobile insert to a point on a surface of the femoral head or
                                                    - 22 -

mobile insert, and the femoral head or mobile insert axis. In some embodiments, the point marks a
location where a change in geometry of the femoral head or mobile insert surface occurs. The theta
angle is measured in a plane coincident with the femoral head axis or mobile insert axis.
[00186] The term "azimuth angle" as used herein refers to an angle measured in a plane perpendicular
to an axis. In relation to a mobile insert or femoral head, the azimuth angle is the angle between a line
from the mobile insert or femoral head axis to a point on a surface of the mobile insert or femoral
head, and another line from the mobile insert or femoral head axis to a reference location on the
surface of the mobile insert or femoral head.
[00187] The term "chamfer" as used herein refers to a planar surface or edge that is not perpendicular
to another planar surface or edge. A chamfer is also equivalent to a convex/concave surface or edge of
very large radius.
[00188] The term "textured" is used herein in reference to a surface. A "textured" surface indicates
presence of a network or series of raised and/or depressed features on the surface, or the presence of a
network or series of grooves, valleys, or troughs. The term "texturing" as used herein refers to a
process of creating such a textured surface.
[00189] The terms "polar location", "pole," and "apex" are used interchangeably herein in reference to
generally spherical geometries such as a femoral head or a mobile insert. The polar location, pole, or
apex of a prosthetic femoral head is the furthest point on the component from a geometric center of a
femoral head rim of the head. The polar location, pole, or apex of a prosthetic mobile insert is the
furthest point on the component from a geometric center of a mobile insert rim of the insert.
Typically, the polar location, pole, or apex of a femoral head or mobile insert is coincident with a
femoral head or insert axis.
[00190] The term "shape memory" is used herein to refer to a material that can change its density,
volume, geometry, and/or other physical or chemical properties under action of an external stimulus
that can be imposed artificially or that can occur naturally.
[00191] The term "margin" as used herein refers to an edge or border of something.
[00192] The term "frictional torque" as used herein refers to torque caused by a frictional force that
occurs when two objects in contact move relative to each other, such as when two surfaces articulate
relative to each other. In a hip implant, frictional torque is produced at the articulation between a
femoral head and an acetabular liner, at the articulation between a femoral head and a mobile insert, at
the articulation between a mobile insert and an acetabular shell, at the articulation between a mobile
insert and native acetabulum, etc.

 [00193] OVERVIEW
 [00194] Various embodiments of femoral heads, acetabular components, mobile inserts, and modular
junctions for orthopedic implants, e.g., hip replacement implants, are provided. Additionally, various
embodiments of methods of using femoral heads, acetabular components, mobile inserts, and modular
junctions for orthopedic implants, e.g., hip replacement implants, are provided. The femoral heads,
mobile inserts, and acetabular components described herein can be configured to alleviate soft tissue
impingement, reduce implant wear, and/or reduce frictional torque. Various femoral head
embodiments are described herein in relation to large diameter femoral heads, e.g., having a diameter
greater than about 32mm. However, the femoral heads designs described herein can be applicable to
prosthetic femoral heads of all diameters, including implants that only replace the native femoral head
and not the native acetabulum (e.g., hemi-arthroplasty implants). Various mobile inserts embodiments
are described in relation to dual mobility implants. However, these mobile insert designs are also
applicable to any hip prosthesis that employs a mobile acetabular component. The modular junctions
described herein can be configured to minimize the incidence of loosening and micromotion that can
occur at these junctions. Various embodiments are described herein in relation to a modular femoral
head-neck junction of a hip implant. However, such modular junctions can be employed at any
location within any type of orthopedic implant where it is desired to join two components.
 [00195] PROSTHESIS MATERIALS AND CONSTRUCTION
 [00196] The implants described herein can be constructed in various manners and can be made from
one or more materials. Implant components (e.g., acetabular shell, acetabular liner, mobile insert,
femoral head, femoral stem, femoral neck, and modular junction) can be machined, cast, forged,
molded, or otherwise constructed out of a medical grade, physiologically acceptable material such as
a cobalt chromium alloy, a titanium alloy, stainless steel, ceramic, etc. Other examples of materials
for the implants include polyolefins, polyethylene, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene,
medium-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, medium-density polyethylene, highly
cross-linked ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), etc. Exemplary embodiments of
UHMWPE prosthesis materials and manufacturing processes are described in US Pat. No. 5,879,400
filed February 13, 1996 entitled "Melt-Irradiated Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene

Linking Of Antioxidant-Containing Polymers;" which are hereby incorporated by reference in their
entireties.
[00197] Depending on the selection of materials for the different prosthetic components, the prosthesis
can involve metal on metal articulations, metal on polyethylene articulations, ceramic on polyethylene
articulations, ceramic on ceramic articulations, ceramic on metal articulations, polyethylene on
polyethylene articulations, metal on native tissue, polyethylene on native tissue, ceramic on native
tissue, etc.
[00198] The prosthetic components can be constructed in various sizes to fit a range of typical
patients, or the components can be custom-designed for a specific patient based on data provided by a
surgeon, e.g., after physical and radiography examination of the specific patient. Additionally, in
some implants, such as those involving ceramic on ceramic articulations or metal on metal
articulations, the acetabular shell can directly articulate with the femoral head without an intermediate
acetabular liner. In other implants, the acetabular liner and acetabular shell can be a single
monoblock component. Similarly, in some implants the femoral head and femoral stem can be distinct
components. In other implants, the femoral head and femoral stem can be a single monoblock
component.
[00199] The femoral head or mobile insert can have a mushroom shape as shown in various
embodiments discussed further below, e.g., embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 10, 11 B, 12A, 12B,
13B, 14D, and 15-17B. The femoral head or mobile insert can also be spherical, semi-spherical, or
ball-like, and the femoral head and the mobile insert can together have a mushroom shape, as shown
in various embodiments discussed further below, e.g., embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 12A-12C and
20A-21B.
[00200] PREVENTING SOFT TISSUE IMPINGEMENT
[00201] Conventional large diameter femoral heads and mobile inserts, such as those shown in FIGS.
2A, 2B, and 4 have a spherical outer articular surface that is axisymmetric about a femoral head or
mobile insert axis, and composed of a single radius R that has an angular extent, P, of about 120'. In
contrast, the articular surface of the native femoral head is not axisymmetric about the femoral head
axis. Additionally, some portions of the native femoral head articular surface have an angular extent
that is significantly less than that of the conventional femoral heads and mobile inserts. As shown in
FIGS. 8A-8D, an angular extent      P (FIGS.  8B and 8D) of a native femoral head articular surface 56 of
a femoral head 60 can be measured at different locations around a femoral head axis 58 characterized
by an azimuth angle c . FIGS. 8A and 8B show a coronal plane view of the native femoral head 60
and a coronal cross-section through a femoral head center 62. A proximal-lateral margin or edge of

the femoral head articular surface 56 corresponds to     @=  0  and 3600, and a distal-medial margin or
edge corresponds to   @=    1800. FIGS. 8C and 8D show a transverse view of the native femoral head
56 and a transverse cross-section through the geometric center 62 of the femoral head 56. A anterior
most margin or edge of the femoral head articular surface 56 corresponds to       @=  900, and a posterior
most margin or edge corresponds to      @=  2700. When the hip joint is seen in a frontal or coronal view
with the leg straight relative to the pelvis, the medial most margin of the femoral head articular
surface is located distal to the lateral most margin, as shown in FIGS. 5A and 6A.
[00202] FIG. 9 shows a plot of the angular extent of the native femoral head articular surface 56 in
solid black line and an outer articular surface of a conventional large diameter femoral head prosthesis
or mobile insert in dashed black lines, as a function of the azimuth angle     @ around the native  femoral
head axis 62. (Data in FIG. 9 is adapted from Cobb et. al "Why Large-Head Metal-On-Metal Hip
Replacements Are Painful: The Anatomical Basis Of Psoas Impingement On The Femoral Head-Neck
Junction," J Bone Joint Surg Br. 2011 Jul, 93(7):881-5.) Herein, the prosthetic femoral head or
mobile insert axis 58 is parallel to the native femoral head (or native femoral neck axis). As shown in
FIG. 9, the angular extent of the native femoral head articular surface is not constant. At the anterior
most and the posterior most margins, the angular extent     P of the native  femoral articular surface is
about 1200. However, at the proximal-lateral and distal-medial margins, the angular extent of the
native femoral articular surface is only about 1000. In contrast, conventional large diameter femoral
heads and mobile inserts have an articular surface 56 composed of a single fixed radius that matches
the native femoral head radius, and a constant angular extent     P of about  1200 around the femoral head
or mobile insert axis 58. The single radius design of the prosthetic components, combined with the
constant angular extent, leads to implant overhang over the shaded region shown in FIG. 9 (also see
FIGS. 6A and 6B). The anterior-medial (or anterior-distal) overhang in particular can impinge on the
iliopsoas muscle or tendon under combined hip flexion and abduction or combined hip flexion and
external rotation. These overhanging portions of the implant can also impinge the iliopsoas during hip
extension, as the iliopsoas wraps around the distal portion of the native femoral head before inserting
onto the lesser trochanter of the femoral bone (see FIG. 5A). This problem is further confounded by
any errors in implant sizing, implant positioning variations, and limitations in range of available
implant sizes. For example, large metal-on-metal total hip implants can fail due to anterior iliopsoas
and capsular impingement from large diameter femoral head prosthesis. (See Browne et al. "Failure
Of Larger-Diameter Metal-On-Metal Total Hip Arthroplasty Resulting From Anterior Iliopsoas
Impingement," J Arthroplasty 2011 Sep, 26(6):978.e5-8.)
[00203] Various embodiments of prostheses disclosed herein can address the above issues. In some
embodiments, a portion of an outer surface of a prosthetic femoral head or a mobile insert is
contoured to move the surface inwards or towards the interior, such as closer to a center of an overall

spherical geometry of the surface. In other embodiments, a portion of an outer surface of a femoral
head or mobile insert is trimmed or carved to remove material from regions of potential impingement
with native soft-tissue. In other embodiments, features on the mobile insert and/or acetabular shell
help guide the relative movement of components to minimize potential impingement with native soft
tissue.
[00204] AXISYMMETRIC EMBODIMENTS
[00205] In an axisymmetric embodiment of an orthopedic implant, an outer surface of a femoral head
or mobile insert can be contoured to avoid significant overhang over the native articular surface. In
other words, a portion of the outer surface of the prosthetic femoral head or mobile insert can be
contoured to move the surface inwards relative to an overall spherical geometry of the implant.
[00206] In some embodiments, such axisymmetric contoured articular surfaces can be composed of
multiple radii of curvature. As in an exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 10, a femoral head
articular surface of a femoral head 64 can be part spherical so as to have an overall spherical geometry
68 with a radius R matching an overall spherical radius of a native femoral head of equivalent size,
and with a smaller radius r that forms a peripheral portion of the femoral head 64. FIG. 10 also shows
a conventional femoral head 66 to facilitate comparison between the axisymmetric femoral head and
the conventional femoral head. The overall spherical radius of the axisymmetric femoral head 64 and
the conventional femoral head 66 are identical, and equal to R. As seen in the cross-sectional view of
FIG. 10, the contoured and conventional femoral heads 64, 66 have identical geometries until a theta
angle 0, measured with respect to a femoral head axis 74. Thereafter, the articular surface radius is
reduced for the contoured head 64, and this smaller radius portion 70 extends to the peripheral
margin, rim, or edge of the implant. An overall angular extent of the femoral head articular surface
is approximately equal to an overall angular extent of the femoral head articular surface P' of a
conventional implant. The contoured geometry minimizes overhang of the femoral head 64 beyond
the native articular surface, and thereby potential for soft-tissue impingement, as shown in FIG. 11 B.
For comparison with FIG. 1 IB, FIG. 11 A illustrates overhang 72 of the conventional femoral head 66
in relation to the native femoral head geometry.
[00207] As in an exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 12A-12C, an articular surface of a
mobile insert 80 can be part spherical with a radius R approximately matching an overall spherical
geometry 82 of radius R of a native femoral head of equivalent size, and with a smaller radius r that
forms a peripheral portion of the mobile insert 80. FIGS. 12A-12C also show a conventional mobile
insert 84 to facilitate comparison between the axisymmetric mobile insert 80 and the conventional
mobile insert 84. As seen in the cross-sectional view of FIG. 12B, the contoured and conventional
mobile inserts 80, 84 have identical geometries until a theta angle 0, measured with respect to a

mobile insert axis 88. Thereafter, the articular surface radius is reduced for the contoured mobile
insert 80, and this smaller radius portion extends to a peripheral margin or rim of the implant. An
overall angular extent   P of the mobile insert's articular surface is approximately equal to the
conventional implant's overall angular extent P'. The contoured surface geometry minimizes
overhang of the insert 80 beyond the native articular surface, and thereby potential for soft-tissue
impingement, as shown in FIG. 13B. For comparison with FIG. 13B, FIG. 13A illustrates overhang
86 of the conventional insert 84 in relation to the native femoral head geometry.
[00208] FIGS. 14A-14E variously show a conventional femoral head/mobile insert 90, and an
exemplary embodiment of a femoral head/mobile insert 92 disclosed herein mounted on a computer
tomography (CT) based bone model of a cadaver specimen. As seen in FIGS. 14A-14E, while the
conventional femoral head or insert (FIGS. 14A, 14B, 14D, and 14E) overhangs 94 the native femoral
head articular surface in the anterior-medial (or anterior-distal) and posterior-medial (or posterior
distal) regions, the femoral head and mobile insert 92 disclosed herein (FIGS. 14C, 14D, and 14E) are
fully contained within the articular surface of the native femoral head. The overhang 94 of the
conventional femoral head/mobile insert 90 can be 3mm, as in FIG. 14E.
[00209] FIG. 15 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a femoral head 96 overlaid on a lateral
radiograph of a patient with a conventional large diameter femoral prosthesis 98. As seen in FIG. 15,
the femoral head 96 has a contoured peripheral articular surface configured to reduce potential for
soft-tissue impingement, as opposed to the conventional large diameter femoral prosthesis 98. In this
illustrated embodiment, the femoral head 96 has a 36mm diameter, and the conventional large
diameter femoral prosthesis 98 has a 36mm diameter.
[00210] In an exemplary embodiment of a femoral head, an overall spherical radius R of the outer
surface of the femoral head (see FIG. 10) is about 18mm, but the overall spherical radius R can be in a
range of about 10mm to 40mm, about 15mm to 35mm, about 20 mm to 30mm, etc. A smaller
contoured radius r of the femoral head (see FIG. 7) is about 11mm, but the smaller contoured radius r
can be in a range of about 1mm to 38mm, about 5mm to 25mm, about 10 mm to 20 mm, etc. A ratio
of the two radii, r/R, is about 0.6, but can be in a range of about 0.025 to 0.95, about 0.3 to 0.7, about
0.4 to 0.6, etc. A theta angle 0 marking transition from the larger radius R to the small radius r (see
FIG. 10) is about 750, but it can be in a range of about 10 to 1150, about 450 to 900, about 600 to 750,
etc. The overall angular extent of the outer articular surface   P (see FIG. 10) is about 1250 but can be in
a range of about 500 to 1500, about 1000 to 1300, about 1100 to 1200, etc.
[00211] In the exemplary femoral head embodiment of FIG. 10 and FIG. 1 IB, the contoured
peripheral portion 70 of the femoral head articular surface is composed of a single radius r that is
smaller than the overall spherical radius R. In some embodiments, the peripheral portion can be

composed of a plurality of radii r1 to r,, where n can be any number greater than or equal to one, such
as two radii (r 1 and r 2 ), three radii (r1 to r 3), four radii (r1 to r 4 ), etc., that are each smaller, larger, or
equal to the overall spherical radius R. In some embodiments, the peripheral portion can be
continuously varying radii r1 to r,, such as gradually reducing radii, where "n" is an integer greater
than one. An arc angle of these smaller radii can be defined by additional parameters 01 to                   0. The
radii r1 to r, can be in a range of about 1mm to 100mm, about 10mm to 40mm, about 20mm to 30
mm, etc. The arc angle 01 to        0, can be in a range of about      10 to 1200, about 200 to 900, about 450 to
600, etc. FIG. 16A illustrates an embodiment of a femoral head 100 composed of two radii r1 and r 2 .
FIG. 16A also shows an overall spherical geometry 104 of the femoral head 100, with the sphere
having a radius R. In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 16B, a contoured peripheral portion of a
femoral head articular surface of a femoral head 106 can be in the form of a chamfered surface with a
chamfer angle y of about 150, although the chamfer angle y can be in a range of about 10 to 800, about
150 to 600, about 400 to 500, etc. FIG. 16B also shows an overall spherical geometry 108 of the
femoral head 106, with the sphere having a radius R. In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 16C, a
contoured peripheral portion of a femoral head 110 can be in the form of a concave radius r' of about
45mm, although the concave radius r' can be in a range of about 1 mm to 100mm, about 15mm to
80mm, about 45mm to 60mm, etc. FIG. 16C also shows an overall spherical geometry 112 of the
femoral head 108, with the sphere having a radius R.
[00212] In some embodiments, a combination of convex radii, concave radii, and chamfers can be
used to contour an outer articular surface of a femoral head, as shown in embodiments illustrated in
FIGS. 17A and 17B. In one embodiment shown in FIG. 17A, a contoured outer articular surface of a
femoral head 114 can be composed of a radius R matching an overall spherical radius of the head's
overall spherical geometry 116 until a theta angle 0, a smaller convex radius r extending from the
theta angle 0 to 01, and a chamfer of angle y extending from 01 to a peripheral edge or implant rim. In
another embodiment shown in FIG. 17B, a contoured outer articular surface of a femoral head 118
can be composed of a radius R matching an overall spherical radius of the head's overall spherical
geometry 120 and extending to a theta angle 0, a smaller convex radius r extending from 0 to 01, and a
concave radius r' extending from 01 to the peripheral edge or implant rim. In another embodiment,
contouring of a femoral head's outer articular surface can be achieved with complex spline curves.
Thus, a portion of an outer surface of a femoral head can be contoured in any number of ways so as to
move the surface inwards relative to an overall spherical geometry of the implant. A maximum
inward shift of the contoured surface relative to the overall spherical geometry can be at least about
1mm. However, the maximum inward shift can be greater than about 1.5mm, greater than about 2mm,
greater than about 8mm, etc. For example, in an embodiment of a femoral head 122 shown in FIG.
17C, inward shift increases gradually from 61 at an angular location o 1 to a maximum value of 6i at
angular location o corresponding to the femoral head rim, where i is an integer greater than two.

[00213] As shown in FIG. 12A, the contouring of the mobile insert 80 results in a reduction of the
insert's thickness by an amount dti at a rim of the implant 80 relative to the conventional insert 84.
This reduction in thickness can lead to a reduction in the restraint against extraction or removal of the
small diameter femoral head captured within the inner articulation (see FIG. 3B). To compensate for
this reduction in the restraint against extraction, in an exemplary embodiment, coverage of the small
diameter femoral head by the mobile insert 80 can be increased slightly by increasing the angular
extent of the inner articular surface from a' to a, as shown in FIG. 12C. This may also be associated
with a slight increase in overall angular extent of the outer articular surface from P' to P, as shown in
FIG. 12B.
[00214] FIGS. 18A and 18B show a comparison of an extraction force required to extract (or remove /
pull out) an embodiment of a small diameter femoral head 124 out of a conventional mobile insert
126, and out of the insert 80 of FIGS. 12A-12C and 13B. One cycle of insertion and extraction of the
small diameter femoral head out of the dual mobility insert was simulated within a structural analysis
software. The design of the mobile insert 80 of FIGS. 12A-12C and 13B was tuned to achieve the
same resistance against extraction as the conventional implant 126. As shown in FIG. 18B, the insert
80 (darker grey bar, the bar on the right) and the conventional insert 126 (lighter grey bar, the baron
the left) have identical resistance to extraction of a small diameter femoral head from the inner
articulation. In other embodiments, as shown in FIGS. 19A-19C, strength of a contoured peripheral
portion of a mobile insert 128 can be enhanced by the addition of a supporting ring 130 (shown in
FIGS. 19B and 19C) made of a material (such as stainless steel) that is stiffer and stronger than a
material (such as polyethylene) forming the insert 128. FIGS. 19A and 19B also show an acetabular
shell 134 mated to the mobile insert 128. For comparison purposes, FIGS. 19A and 19B also show a
conventional mobile insert 132.
[00215] In an exemplary embodiment, an overall spherical radius R of an outer surface of a mobile
insert (see FIG. 12A) is about 22mm, but the overall spherical radius R can be in a range of about
10mm to 40mm, about 15mm to 35mm, about 20 mm to 30mm, etc. A smaller contouring radius r of
the insert (see FIG. 12A) is about 14mm in an exemplary embodiment, but it can be in a range of
about 1mm to 38mm, about 5mm to 25mm, about 10 mm to 20 mm, etc. A ratio of the two radii, r/R,
is about 0.6 in an exemplary embodiment, but it can be in a range of about 0.025 to 0.95, about 0.3 to
0.7, about 0.4 to 0.6, etc. The theta angle 0 marking transition from the larger radius R to the small
radius r (see FIG. 12B) is about 750 in an exemplary embodiment, but it can be in a range of about 20
to 1200, about 450 to 900, about 600 to 750, etc. An overall angular extent of the inner articular
surface a (see FIG. 12C) is about 1160 in an exemplary embodiment, but can be in a range of about
910 to 1250, about 950 to 1200, about 1000 to 1100 etc. The overall angular extent of the outer
articular surface P (see FIG. 12B)   is about 1250 in an exemplary embodiment, but it can be in a range
                                                    - 30 -

[00216] In the exemplary embodiment of FIGS. 12A- 12C and 13B, a contoured peripheral portion of
the mobile insert 80 is composed of the single radius r that is smaller than the overall spherical radius
R. In some embodiments, the peripheral portion can be composed of a plurality of radii r 1 to r,, where
n can be any number greater than or equal to one, such as two radii (r1 and r 2), three radii (r 1 to r3),
four radii (r1 to r 4), etc., that are smaller than the overall spherical radius R. In some embodiments,
the peripheral portion can be continuously varying radii r 1 to r,, such as gradually reducing radii. An
arc angle of these smaller radii can be defined by additional parameters 01 to 0,. The smaller radii r 1
to r, can be in a range of about 1mm to 38mm, about 5mm to 25mm, about 10mm to 20 mm, etc. The
arc angle 01 to 0,, can be in a range of about 10 to 1200, about 200 to 900, about 450 to 600, etc. FIG.
20A illustrates an embodiment of an insert 136 composed of two radii r1 and r 2 . In some
embodiments, such as in an embodiment shown in FIG. 20B, a contoured peripheral portion of a
mobile insert 138 can be in the form of a chamfered surface with a chamfer angle y of about 150,
although the chamfer angle y can be in a range of about 20 to 800, about 150 to 600, about 400 to 500,
etc. In some embodiments, such as in an embodiment shown in FIG. 20C, a contoured peripheral
portion of an insert 140 can be in the form of a concave radius r' of about 45mm, although the
concave radius r' can be in a range of about 1 mm to 100 mm, about 15 mm to 80 mm, about 45 mm
to 60 mm, etc.
[00217] In some embodiments, a combination of smaller convex radii, concave radii, and chamfers
can be used to contour an outer articular surface of a mobile insert, as shown in embodiments
illustrated in FIGS. 21 A and 21 B. In one embodiment shown in FIG. 21 A, a contoured outer articular
surface of a mobile insert 142 can be composed of a radius R matching an overall spherical radius
until a theta angle 0, a smaller convex radius r extending from the theta angle 0 to 01, and a chamfer of
angle y extending from 01 to the peripheral edge or implant rim. In another embodiment shown in
FIG. 21B, a contoured outer articular surface of a mobile insert 144 can be composed of a radius R
matching an overall spherical radius and extending to a theta angle 0, a smaller convex radius r
extending from 0 to 01, and a concave radius r' extending from 01 to a peripheral edge or implant rim.
In yet other embodiments, contouring of a mobile insert's outer articular surface can be achieved with
complex spline curves. Thus, a portion of a mobile insert can be contoured in any number of ways so
as to move the insert articular surface inwards relative to a surface of an overall spherical geometry of
the insert. A maximum inward shift of the contoured surface relative to the overall spherical geometry
can be at least about 1mm, e.g., greater than about 1.5mm, greater than about 2mm, greater than about
8mm etc. In some embodiments, the maximum inward shift of the contoured surface relative to the
overall spherical geometry can be less than about 1mm.

    WO 2014/052768                                                                  PCT/US2013/062203
[00219] In some embodiments, contouring of a femoral head or mobile insert articular surface, such as
with a change in radius of curvature, is such that a theta angle 0 is at least about 800, and but not
greater than about 1150 (see FIGS. 10 and 12). Exemplary embodiments of femoral heads 146, 148
with a theta angle 0 of 90.5 , and a theta angle 0 of 800, are shown in FIGS. 22A and 22B,
respectively. Reason(s) for peripheral contouring with this range of theta angle 0 are described below.
[00220] One of the design considerations for hip arthroplasty implants can be maximizing resistance
to dislocation. Dislocation typically occurs when a femoral neck of an implant impinges against an
acetabular rim, causing a femoral head or mobile insert of the implant to move out of the implant's
acetabular component with continued hip joint rotation. The resistance to dislocation can be described
in terms of jump distance. This jump distance indicates an amount of displacement the femoral head
or mobile insert can undergo prior to a lateral dislocation out of the acetabular component. Generally,
the larger an overall spherical radius of the femoral head or mobile insert, the greater the jump
distance and resistance to dislocation. However, if contouring of the femoral head or mobile insert is
started too soon, such that a theta angle 0 is < about 600, the dislocation resistance of the implant can
be reduced. This is shown schematically in FIG. 23 for femoral heads and in FIG. 56 for mobile
inserts.
[00221] At a point of eminent dislocation, as shown in FIG. 23, an acetabular rim of an acetabular
shell/liner 156 contacts a first femoral head 150 (having 0 = 90.50) and a conventional femoral head
152 at a same location on non-contoured regions of the heads 150, 152. Hence, a jump distance for the
first femoral head 150 and the conventional femoral head 152 are identical. However, at a point of
eminent dislocation for a second femoral head 154 with a theta angle 0 of 500, the acetabular rim
would contact the femoral head 154 on the contoured region. Hence, a jump distance for the second
femoral head 154 can be reduced relative to the conventional femoral head 152 of equivalent overall
spherical radius, and relative to the first femoral head 150. As shown in FIG. 24, the jump distance for
the first femoral head 150 is identical to that of the conventional femoral head 152 of equivalent
overall spherical radius (R = 18mm in this illustrated embodiment). However, the jump distance for
the second femoral head 154 is less than, e.g., about 2mm less than, that of the conventional femoral
head 152 of equivalent overall spherical radius, and relative to the first femoral head 150.
[00222] Similarly, at a point of eminent dislocation, as shown in a dual mobility implant dislocation
schematic of FIG. 56, an acetabular rim of an acetabular shell/liner 158 contacts a first mobile insert
160 (having 0 = 900), and a conventional mobile insert 162 at a same location on the non-contoured
regions of the inserts 160, 162. Hence, a jump distance for the first mobile insert 160 and the
conventional mobile insert 162 are identical. However, at a point of eminent dislocation for a second
mobile insert 164 with a theta angle 0 of 600, the acetabular rim would contact the mobile insert 164
on the contoured region. Hence, a jump distance for the second mobile insert 164 is reduced relative
                                                    - 32 -

to the conventional mobile insert 162 of equivalent overall spherical radius, and relative to the first
mobile insert 160. As shown in FIG. 57, the jump distance for the first mobile insert 160 is identical
to that of the conventional mobile insert 162 of equivalent overall spherical radius (R = 22mm in this
illustrated embodiment). However, the jump distance for the second mobile insert 164 is less than,
e.g., about 1.7mm, that of the conventional mobile insert 162 of equivalent overall spherical radius,
and relative to the first mobile insert 160.
[00223] Ensuring sufficient contact area between a femoral head and an acetabular shell/liner or
between a mobile insert and acetabular shell/liner can minimize risk of failure or accelerated damage
of the implant components. For a contoured femoral head or mobile insert, starting the contouring too
soon (e.g., theta angle 0 < about 800) can lead to reduction in contact area relative to a conventional
design, which may not be desirable. FIG. 25 shows results of a series of finite element analyses for a
femoral head articulating against an acetabular liner. In these simulations, the peak in vivo joint loads
and corresponding in vivo joint kinematics determined by Bergmann et al. were used (see Bergmann
et al. "Hip Contact Forces And Gait Patterns From Routine Activities," J Biomech. 2001 Jul,
34(7):859-71.). The femoral head and acetabular shell were treated as rigid, and the acetabular liner
was modeled as UHMWPE with elastoplastic material model. The table in FIG. 25 shows the contact
area between the femoral head and acetabular liner in mm 2 , and the percent change in contact area for
the contoured femoral head 148, 150 of FIGS. 22B and 23 relative to the conventional femoral head
152 of FIG. 23. As shown in FIG. 25, the first femoral head 150 with theta angle 0 of 900 shows no
changes in contact area when compared to the conventional femoral head 152 (see also the formal
head 146 of FIG. 22A with theta angle 0 of 900, comparable in result to the first femoral head 150).
However, the femoral head 148 with the theta angle 0 of 800 shows substantial reduction in contact
area compared to the conventional femoral head 152.
[00224] While a femoral head or mobile insert articular surface can be contoured such that a theta
angle 0 is at least about 80', the theta angle 0 can be less than about 115'. This can achieve substantial
soft-tissue relief (see FIG. 9).
[00225] PriorArt Axisymmetric Femoral Heads
[00226] Conventional axisymmetric femoral heads are briefly described below for purposes of
comparison with axisymmetric femoral heads disclosed herein. In a hip implant, the joint load is
supported by a contact area between the implant's femoral head and acetabular component, extending
over a limited portion of the femoral head articular surface. Axisymmetric femoral head designs that
alter the articular surface geometry to reduce this load bearing contact area have been described in
prior art. For example, US Pat. No. 6,059,830 filed August 3, 1998 entitled "Low Wear Ball And Cup
Joint Prosthesis" describes a metal-on-metal femoral head with a portion of the femoral head articular
                                                    - 33 -

    WO 2014/052768                                                                PCT/US2013/062203
surface having a radius R closely matching that of the acetabular component. Outside this zone of
intimate contact, the femoral head radius is reduced slightly from R to r", such that for R = 18mm,
17.68mm < r" < 17.98mm. This creates a clearance between the acetabular component and the
femoral head surfaces, thereby limiting the articular contact area to the region of radius R. In this prior
art, the shaping of the femoral head is configured such that theta angle 0 is < about 800 (preferably <
about 500), and occurs well within the load bearing region of a conventional femoral head. This is
done so as to reduce articular contact area and thereby articular wear. Additionally, in this prior art,
the shaping of the femoral head results in negligible removal of material from the peripheral portion
of the implant to provide any meaningful soft-tissue relief. FIGS. 26A and 26B show prior art femoral
head designs of US Pat. No. 6,059,830, with a theta angle 0 ranging from 200 to 800 and with a
contoured radius r" = 17.68mm (smallest value from the possible range of 17.68mm < r" < 17.98mm
for R = 18mm). In FIG. 26A, there is negligible inward shift relative to overall spherical geometry (6i
= 0.44mm). In FIG. 26B, there is negligible inward shift relative to overall spherical geometry (6i =
0.12mm). Thus, the prior art describes less than 0.44mm of inward shift of the peripheral articular
surface relative to the overall spherical geometry of the femoral head. In contrast, in embodiments of
orthopedic implants disclosed herein, peripheral contouring is configured such that a theta angle 0 is >
about 80'. This result in contouring of a femoral head outside of a load bearing region of a
conventional femoral head, and therefore the load bearing contact area is not reduced. In orthopedic
implants disclosed herein, contouring of a femoral head is configured to create substantial inward shift
(e.g., > about 1mm) of a peripheral articular surface so as to provide meaningful soft-tissue relief.
FIG.26C shows an overlay of the femoral head 148 embodiment of FIG. 22B, and the prior art
femoral head of FIG. 26B. As shown in FIG. 26C, in contrast to the femoral head 148, the prior art
head results in negligible inward shift of the peripheral portion of the femoral head relative to the
overall spherical geometry of the femoral head.
[00227] Many conventional femoral heads use a short chamfer to join the femoral head articular
surface to the femoral head rim. Often this chamfer is provided as a surface for laser marking of the
implant, such as with a convention femoral head shown in FIG. 26D. However, the theta angle 0
associated with such chamfers in conventional implants is greater than about 1180. Thus, any
peripheral surface contouring resulting from such chamfers occurs well beyond the articular margin of
the native femoral head to provide any meaningful soft-tissue relief (see FIG. 9). FIG.26E shows an
overlay of the femoral head 148 embodiment of FIG. 22B, and the prior art femoral head of FIG. 26D
with a chamfer resulting in theta angle 0 of 1180. As shown in FIG. 26E, in contrast to the femoral
head 148 of FIG. 22B, the peripheral surface contouring resulting from the chamfer in the femoral
head of FIG. 26D leads to negligible inward shift of the articular surface relative to the overall
spherical geometry of the femoral head, and occurs well beyond the articular margin of the native
femoral head to provide any meaningful soft-tissue relief.

[00228] USE OF CONVEX RADIUS TO BEGIN PERIPHERAL CONTOURING
[00229] While a peripheral portion of a femoral head or mobile insert can be contoured in any number
of ways, in an exemplary embodiment, the contouring immediately following a non-contoured region
of radius R begins with a convex radius r (see FIGS. 10, 16A, and 17A-17C). This convex radius r can
be greater than about 2mm, e.g., greater than about 5mm, greater than about 8mm, greater than about
12mm, etc. The convex radius r smoothly blends into the non-contoured portion of radius R and has
an arc angle 01 of about 350, but can be in the range of about 20 to 1000, about 300 to 80', about 450 to
650 etc. (see FIGS. 17A and 17B). The use of a convex radius, as opposed to a chamfer or concave
radius, prevents a sharp transition from the non-contoured non-peripheral portion to the contoured
peripheral portion of the femoral head (see FIGS. 16B and 16C). At extremes of hip joint motion this
transition region can contact the acetabular component, and a sharp transition can lead to high contact
stresses. FIG.27 shows contact pressure between an UHMWPE acetabular liner and various cobalt
chromium femoral heads, including a conventional femoral head 166 composed of single radius R
(18mm for the illustrated conventional femoral head), and femoral head embodiments composed of a
radius R (18 mm for each of the four illustrated embodiments having maximum contact pressure of at
least 10.3MPa) having various contoured peripheral profiles. In the femoral head embodiment
contoured with convex radii, the peripheral contouring begins with a convex radius and is composed
of two convex radii. In the femoral head embodiment contoured with a chamfer, the peripheral
contouring is achieved with a chamfer. In the femoral head embodiment contoured with concave radii,
the peripheral contouring is achieved with a concave radius. In the femoral head embodiment with
abrupt termination of articular surface, the peripheral contouring is achieved by abrupt termination of
the femoral articular surface, resulting in an orthogonal edge. As shown in FIG. 27, the contact
pressure between the femoral head contoured with convex radii and the acetabular liner is similar to
the contact pressure between the conventional femoral head and the acetabular liner. However, the
contact pressures for the other three femoral head embodiments shown in FIG. 27 are significantly
higher.
[00230] CONTOURING OF FEMORAL ARTICULAR SURFACE IN MODULAR IMPLANTS
[00231] As described above, peripheral contouring can start with a convex radius. Following the
convex radius, a remainder of the peripheral portion can be completed in any manner, such as with
any combination of convex radii (ri), concave radii, or chamfers (see FIGS. 16A-17C). In femoral
heads with a modular taper junction, the use of a series of convex radii ri can result in reduction of a
length H of a female taper surface, and hence a length of the taper junction. One such embodiment (I)
is shown in FIGS. 28A and 28B. Excessive reduction of taper junction length may not be desired, as it
can affect the strength and stability of the taper junction. In contrast, use of a series of convex radii
such as in embodiment (II) shown in FIGS. 28A and 28C, can help retain the length H of the female
                                                    - 35 -

taper surface. However, this may provide insufficient soft-tissue relief due to reduced inward shift of
the peripheral surface of the femoral head. To balance the competing requirements of contouring for
soft-tissue relief and maximizing or maintaining the taper junction length, in embodiments (III) and
(IV) shown in FIGS. 28A, 28D, and 28E, the peripheral contouring is completed with the aid of one
or more concave radii or chamfers 168 (FIG. 28E), 170 (FIG. 28F). The use of concave radii       (r' 2 a for
embodiment (III) and   r'2b for embodiment (V) of FIGS. 28A and 28F) or chamfer reverses the radius
of curvature started by an initial convex radius ri, allowing greater amount of peripheral contouring
while maximizing the taper junction length. The female taper surface can also be extended up to the
overall spherical geometry of the head, such as in embodiment (V) where H < H'.
[00232] Within a given modular implant system, contoured femoral heads having the same overall
spherical radius can be provided with different outer surface geometries and/or different female taper
lengths (see FIGS. 58A-59B).     FIG. 58A shows an embodiment of a contoured femoral head 172
overlaid with a conventional femoral head 174 for comparison purposes. FIG. 58B shows another
embodiment of a contoured femoral head 176 overlaid with another conventional femoral head 178
for comparison purposes. The contoured head 176 of FIG. 58B has the same overall spherical radius
as the head 172 of FIG. 58A, different contoured outer surface geometry from the head 172 of FIG.
58A, and different female taper length from the head 172 of FIG. 58A. FIG. 59A shows an
embodiment of a contoured femoral head 180 overlaid with the conventional femoral head 174 for
comparison purposes. FIG. 59B shows another embodiment of a contoured femoral head 182
overlaid with the other conventional femoral head 178 for comparison purposes. The femoral head
182 of FIG. 59B has the same overall spherical radius as the head 180 of FIG. 59A, different
contoured outer surface geometry from the head 180 of FIG. 59A, and same female taper length as the
head 180 of FIG. 59A.
[00233] In modular implants, a contouring of an outer surface of a femoral head can approach edges
of a taper junction with a radial clearance rc, as shown in FIGS. 29A and 29B. FIG. 29A illustrates a
conventional femoral head 184 and conventional taper junction 186. FIG. 29B illustrates an
embodiment of a femoral head 188 having a contoured surface 190, and a taper junction 192. The
radial clearance can be in a range from about 0 mm to 16 mm, about 5 mm to 15 mm, about 10 mm to
12 mm, etc. In some conventional implants, the taper junction extends below the peripheral edge /
rim of the femoral head to allow greater taper junction length or to provide greater flexibility in
selection of appropriate prosthetic femoral neck length. However, this abrupt transition results in a
pronounced/sharp edge that can impinge on soft tissues, as shown in FIG. 29C which illustrates a
conventional femoral head 194, a conventional taper junction 196, and a conventional extended
portion 198 of the taper junction 196. To avoid this, in another embodiment of invention femoral head
200 shown in FIG. 29D, contouring of a peripheral portion of a femoral articular surface 202 can be
                                                    - 36 -

[00234] NON-AXISYMMETRIC EMBODIMENTS
[00235] In the previous sections following the "AXISYMETRIC EMBODIMENTS" heading,
axisymmetric embodiments of femoral heads and mobile inserts were described. In other
embodiments, a femoral head or mobile insert can have a non-axisymmetric geometry about a femoral
head or insert axis such that parameters r, r', 0, a, y, r1 to r,, 01 to 01, etc. vary as a function of an
azimuth angle   @ about  the mobile insert or femoral head axis, while the overall angular extent of an
articular surface  P remains  constant. FIG. 30 illustrates an embodiment of a non-axisymmetric
femoral head or mobile insert with a partial cut-out or recess 206 that can be configured to provide
localized soft-tissue relief. As shown in FIG. 30, contouring of an articular surface can be restricted
to an azimuth angle range of @ I to   4 2 about a femoral head or mobile insert axis 208 so as to create
the partial cut-out or recess206. In other embodiments, partial cut-outs or recesses of femoral heads
or mobile inserts can be created at multiple locations. In another embodiment, a theta angle 0
marking the transition from a spherical radius R to a contoured peripheral radius r can change as a
function of an azimuth angle    @.  FIG. 3 1A illustrates an embodiment of a non-axisymmetric femoral
head 210 with a theta angle 0 marking a transition 212 from a large spherical radius R to a smaller
peripherial radius r varying as a function of azimuth angle       @ about  a femoral head axis 214. FIG. 31 B
illustrates an embodiment of a non-axisymmetric mobile insert 216 with a theta angle 0 marking a
transition 218 from a large spherical radius R to a smaller peripherial radius r varying as a function of
an azimuth angle    @ about  a mobile insert axis 220.
[00236] In some non-axisymmetric embodiments of a femoral head or mobile insert, an overall
angular extent of an articular surface   P can vary as a function of an     azimuth angle   @ about  a femoral
head or mobile insert axis. FIG. 32A illustrates an embodiment of a non-axisymmetric femoral head
222 with a medial articular surface 226 trimmed to match native femoral head geometry. FIG. 32B
illustrates an embodiment of a non-axisymmetric femoral head 224 with medial and lateral articular
surfaces 228, 230 trimmed to match native femoral head geometry. Effectively, this results in
trinmming of some portions of the femoral head. In the embodiment of FIG. 32A, an angular extent of
the articular surface 226 is reduced compared to a conventional implant in the medial portion to better
match the native femoral head geometry, with      P being about     1000 and being less than P', with P'
being about 1200, and with     @ being in a range of about 1500 to 230'. Similarly, in the embodiment of
FIG. 32B, an angular extent of the articular surfaces 228, 230 are reduced relative to a conventional
implant in the medial and lateral portions to better match the native femoral head geometry, with
being about 1000 and being less than P', with P' being about 1200, and with          @ being in a  range of
about 150' to 230', about 3400 to 20'. FIG. 33A illustrates an embodiment of a non-axisymmetric

mobile insert 232 with a medial articular surface 234 trimmed to match native femoral head geometry.
[00237] FIG. 33B illustrates an embodiment of a non-axisymmetric mobile insert 244 with medial and
lateral articular surfaces 236, 238 trimmed to match native femoral head geometry. In the
embodiments of FIGS. 33A and 33B, remaining portions 240, 242 of their respective articular
surfaces are extended beyond that of conventional implants to compensate for reduction in extraction
resistance of the small diameter femoral head from the inner articulation. Effectively, this results in a
reduction of angular extent of some portions of the mobile insert articular surface and an increase in
angular extent of other portions of the mobile insert articular surface. In the embodiment of FIG.
33A, the angular extent of the articular surface is reduced compared to a conventional implant in the
medial portion to better match the native femoral head geometry, with      P being  about 1000 and being
less than P', with P' being about 1200, and with    @ being in a range of about 1500 to 230'.
Concomitantly, the angular extent of the articular surface is increased in other locations beyond that
of a conventional implant, with   P being greater  than P', and with @ being in  a range of about 0' to
150', about 230' to 3600. Similarly, in the embodiment of FIG. 33B, the angular extent of the
articular surface is reduced relative to a conventional implant in the medial and lateral portions to
better match the native femoral head geometry, with      P being about 1000 and being less than P', with
P' being about 1200, and with    @ being in  a range of about 1500 to 2300, about 3400 to 200, etc.
Concomitantly, the angular extent of the articular surface is increased in other locations beyond that
of a conventional implant, with   P being greater  than P' and with  @ being in a range of about 240 to
1500, about 2300 to 3400.
[00238] In a dual mobility implant, a mobile insert of the implant can move relative to both an
acetabular shell of the implant as well as a small diameter inner femoral head of the implant.
Therefore, it can be beneficial to combine a mobile insert articular surface contouring with design
features to guide or control the insert motion in certain directions or degrees-of-freedom, particularly
for non-axisymmetric embodiments. This can help keep the mobile insert in a preferred orientation to
avoid soft tissue impingement.
[00239] This control of the mobile insert motion in different directions can be achieved via various
locking mechanisms and guiding surfaces. In one embodiment, a circular track on an acetabular shell
can be configured to mate with a groove on a mobile insert, thereby allowing full rotational motion
parallel to or along the track while restricting rotation about orthogonal axes. FIGS. 34A and 34B
illustrate an emobodiment of a mobile insert 246 (FIG. 34A) having a groove 248 formed therein that
is configured to mate with a guiding track 250 formed on an acetabular shell 252 (FIG. 34B), thereby
allowing rotational motion parallel to or along the track 250 while restricting rotation 258 about
orthogonal axes. In another embodiment, a circular track formed in an insert can be configured to
mate with a groove formed on an acetabular shell, thereby allowing full rotational freedom parallel to
                                                    - 38 -

    WO 2014/052768                                                                    PCT/US2013/062203
or along the track while restricting rotation about orthogonal axes 254, 256 of the insert 246 and the
shell 252.
[00240] In another embodiment, a protrusion extending from a outer surface of an insert can be
configured to be contained within a recess or depression formed on an inner surface of an acetabular
shell. FIGS. 35A-35C illustrate an embodiment of a mobile insert 260 where engagement of a
protrusion 262 on the insert 262 is configured to be contained within a recess 264 formed in an
acetabular shell 266. The mobile insert 260 also includes contouring 268, which can facilitate soft
tissue relief as discussed herein. The engagement of the protrusion 262 against a wall of the recess
264 controls an amount of allowed rotation in a given direction. The geometry of the protrusion 262
and the acetabular recess 264 can allow specific and/or different amounts of rotation about different
axes before the engagement of the insert protrusion 262 against the recess wall prevents further
rotation. In some embodiments, a protrusion from an insert surface and an acetabular recess can have
circular profiles. In other embodiments, a protrusion from an insert surface and an acetabular recess
can have complex three-dimensional profiles. In still other embodiments, a protrusion from an
acetabular surface can be configured to engage a recess in a mobile insert to allow specific and
different amounts of rotation about different axes.
[00241] In some embodiments, mating surfaces of an acetabular shell, a mobile insert, or a small
diameter inner head can be non-spherical. FIGS. 36A and 36B illustrate embodiments of dual
mobility implants with non-spherical mating surfaces between an acetabular shell, a mobile insert, and
an inner femoral head. FIGS. 36A and 36B show a top down view of embodiments with out-of-plane
axis c-c' being parallel to a femoral head / or mobile insert axis. FIG. 36A illustrates an embodiment
in which an inner surface 270 of an acetabular shell 272 and a mating outer surface 274 of an insert
276 are non-spherical, while an inner surface 278 of the insert 280 and a mating surface 282 of a
small diameter femoral head 284 are spherical. In this embodiment, at the outer articulation the insert
276 can rotate about orthogonal axes a-a' and b-b'. However, rotation of the insert 276 about axis c
c' is restricted. At the inner articulation, rotation of the insert 276 about all three orthogonal axes a-a',
b-b', and c-c' can occur freely. In another embodiment, shown in FIG. 36B, an inner articular surface
286 of a mobile insert 288 and a mating small diameter femoral head 290 are non-spherical, whereas a
spherical outer articular surface 292 of the insert 288 mates with a spherical inner surface 294 of an
acetabular shell 296. In this embodiment, the insert 288 is free to rotate relative to the acetabular shell
296 in all directions of rotational freedom. However, at the inner articulation the rotation of the insert
288 about axis c-c' is restricted, while rotations about orthogonal axes a-a' and b-b' are permitted.

[00243] A non-axisymmetric surface can be obtained by starting with a surface that is symmetric
around an axis d-d', shown in FIG. 37 which illustrates an embodiment of a femoral head 298,and
rotating it relative to another axis e-e'. This results in a surface that is non-axisymmetric about an axis
e-e', but is axisymmetric about the axis d-d'.
[00244] OFFSETTING INNER AND OUTER ARTICULATION CENTERS OF MOBILE INSERT
[00245] In some embodiments of a mobile insert, such as those shown in FIG. 12, a center of the inner
and outer articulation can be coincident. Herein, the center of the outer articulation is a center of an
overall spherical geometry of the outer articular surface (radius R), and the center of the inner
articulation is a center of an overall spherical geometry of the inner articular surface (radius R1, FIG.
3B). In other embodiments, the center of the inner and outer articulation can be non-coincident. A
distance between these centers can be characterized by an offset 'e', shown with respect to
embodiments of mobile insert 300, 310, 312 shown in FIGS. 38A-38C. A value of e in the illustrated
embodiment is about 1.5 to 3 mm, but it can be in the range of about 0.1 mm to 20 mm, about 1.5 mm
to 15 mm, about 3 mm to 10 mm, about 4 mm to 6 mm, etc. This offset of the inner articulation center
relative to the outer articulation center can be in any direction, such that the inner articulation is
shifted towards a pole 302 (FIG. 38A), away from a pole 304 (FIG. 39B), towards a pole 306 and
away from a mobile insert axis 308 (FIG. 38C), and away from a pole and a mobile insert axis, etc.
[00246] The offset between the inner and outer articulations allows the insert to self-adjust in response
to external loads. For example, when the inner articulation is shifted towards the pole relative to the
outer articulation, the mobile insert self-centers under compressive loads such that the mobile insert
axis is aligned with the direction of the load vector (neutral orientation). FIG.39B shows results of a
simulation, where a mobile insert 314 with no offset and a mobile insert 316 with 1.5 mm offset
towards the pole, are rotated by 290 (k) relative to a neutral orientation, as shown in FIG. 39A, and a
fixed compressive load of 700N (F) is applied along a neutral orientation axis. The insert 314 with no
offset remains in the rotated orientation, while the insert 316 with 1.5 mm offset on each side of the
pole (for a total of 3 mm offset) gradually self-centers to return to neutral orientation.
[00247] Offsetting the inner and outer articulation centers allows, for identical articular surface
geometries, a design with offset of the inner articulation towards a pole, shown in an embodiment of
FIG. 40A, has a peripheral thickness 11 that is greater than a peripheral thickness    12 of a design with no
offset, shown in an embodiment of FIG. 40B. This allows for a soft-tissue friendly outer articular
surface design that maximizes the thickness and strength of the peripheral edge. This can also
improve resistance to extraction of the inner femoral head out of the mobile insert. Offsetting the
inner and outer articulation can help to keep the insert in a preferred orientation such that a contoured
portion of the outer articular surface is preferably exposed to the native soft-tissues.

[00248] REDUCTION IN ARTICULAR WEAR AND FRICTIONAL TORQUE
[00249] In addition to the soft-tissue impingements concerns, another concern with the use of large
diameter femoral heads or mobile inserts is the potential for increased frictional torque, wear, and/or
wear rates compared to conventional small diameter femoral heads. (See previously mentioned
Lachiewicz et al. and Livermore et al.) The larger wear and wear rates for the large diameter femoral
heads or mobile inserts can be due to increased contact area between the femoral head/mobile insert
and the acetabular liner/shell.
[00250] The contouring of the femoral head/mobile insert articular surface in some embodiments
discussed previously can aid in reducing the contact area at the inner/outer articulation, thereby
reducing implant wear. The contouring of the femoral head/mobile insert articular surface discussed
previously can also aid in reducing frictional torque. This effect was confirmed via experiments
comparing frictional resistance in a contoured ceramic femoral head articulating against a ceramic
acetabular liner, and frictional resistance in a conventional ceramic femoral head articulating against a
ceramic acetabular liner. Both the contoured femoral head and the conventional femoral head had a
diameter of 36 mm. The tests were conducted using a pendulum comparator (see FIG. 60B, with a
schematic thereof in FIG. 60A) consisting of two stations with 50 lbf weights pivoting around the
loaded ceramic-on-ceramic hip implants. Three each of the contoured ceramic femoral head and
conventional ceramic femoral heads were tested against six ceramic acetabular liners under 100 lbf
and 400 lbf of compressive force. The pendulums were released from the same starting angle and
number of swings to come to a full stop was counted. Herein, greater number of swings is indicative
of lower frictional resistance / frictional torque. In these tests, as shown in FIG. 61, under 100 lbf
compressive force, the contoured heads underwent an average of 28.7  3.7 swings, while the
conventional femoral heads underwent 23.4  5.6 swings. Under 400 lbf compressive load, the
contoured heads underwent an average of 13.9  1.8 swings, while the conventional ceramic femoral
heads underwent 10.4  2.3 swings (FIG. 61). These differences were statistically significant
(p<0.0001), and indicate that the contoured femoral heads can reduce frictional torque.
[00251] Specific peripheral or non-peripheral regions of a femoral head or acetabular articular surface
(acetabular shell, acetabular liner, or mobile insert) can be contoured, such as by removing or carving
out portions of the articular surface to reduce an effective contact area. FIGS. 41A and 41B show
embodiments of femoral heads 318, 320 with non-peripheral portions 322, 324 of a femoral head
articular surface carved around a femoral head axis 326, 328. The head 318 of FIG. 41A has a deeper
carved femoral head articular surface than the head 320 of FIG. 41B. FIGS. 42A and 42B show
embodiments of femoral heads 330, 332 each having a femoral head articular surface 334, 336 carved
along a longitudinal direction, such as around an axis perpendicular to a femoral head axis 338, 340.
The head 330 of FIG. 42A has a deeper carved femoral head articular surface than the head 332 of

show embodiments of mobile inserts 350, 352 each having a mobile insert articular surface 354, 356
carved around an insert axis 358, 360. The insert 350 of FIG. 45A has a deeper carved mobile insert
articular surface than the insert 352 of FIG. 45B. FIGS. 46A and 46B show embodiments of mobile
inserts 362, 364 each having a mobile insert articular surface 366, 368 carved along a longitudinal
direction, such as around an axis perpendicular to an insert axis 370, 372. The insert 362 of FIG. 46A
has a deeper carved mobile insert articular surface than the insert 364 of FIG. 46B. FIG. 47 shows an
embodiment of a mobile insert 374 with a mobile insert articular surface 376 carved around multiple
oblique axes. Similarly, FIG. 48 shows an embodiment of a dual mobility acetabular shell 378 with
an articular surface 380 carved around multiple oblique axes.
 [00252] In some embodiments, a femoral head, mobile insert , or acetabular articular surface can be
textured, which can effectively reduce an articular contact area, e.g., reduce the articular surface area
in contact with an acetabular articular surface. FIGS. 49A-49E show embodiments of textured femoral
heads or mobile inserts, where thick dark lines indicate valleys or troughs on the femoral head's
articular surface. The texturing can lead to effective reduction of the articular surface area in contact
with an acetabular liner or acetabular shell surface.
 [00253] LARGE TAPER JUNCTION
 [00254] In an exemplary embodiment, a taper junction of an orthopedic implant can be a conical taper
junction, as shown in an embodiment of a taper junction 382 shown in FIGS. 50A and 50B, with one
or more of a small diameter circular profile dl, large diameter circular profile d2, and length L being
significantly larger than in a conventional taper junction 50 (see FIGS. 7A-7B). The circular profiles
of conventional taper junctions have a diameter dl and d2 pairing of 8 mm and 10 mm, 12 mm and 14
mm, and 14 mm and 16 mm. A length L of the taper junction 50 measured along a taper axis of the
taper junction 50 is about 10 mm to 12 mm. A resulting taper angle k is in a range of about 5' to 6'.
In the large taper junction 382, dl is greater than about 14 mm, d2 is greater than about 16 mm, and/or
the taper length L is greater than about 12 mm. When used in a femoral head-neck junction, the large
taper junction 382 would occupy a significantly larger volume of a femoral head 384 than the
conventional taper junction 50. In an embodiment with a large d2 diameter, the radial clearance rc
between the edge of the taper surface and the end of the femoral articular surface would be
significantly smaller than in the conventional design 50 (r'c). In an embodiment with a large taper
length L, the taper junction 352 would extend deeper into the femoral head 354 than in the
conventional design 50.

[00255] The larger taper dimension can provide increased resistance to torsional and moment loads,
which can help minimize loosening and micromotion. In the large taper junction 382, a center 386 of
the femoral-head neck taper junction 382 would be located closer to a femoral articular surface than a
center 388 of the conventional femoral-head neck taper junction 50, thereby reducing a moment arm
390 of a joint load 392 acting on the taper joint, as shown in FIG. 50.
[00256] NON-CIRCULAR TAPER JUNCTION
[00257] A modular junction can be a taper junction having a non-circular cross-section perpendicular
to a taper junction axis of the taper junction. The non-circular profile can provide increased resistance
to torsional loads, which can help minimize loosening and micromotion. The non-circular cross
section can take various forms in different embodiments. FIG. 51 illustrates various exemplary
embodiments of taper junctions having non-circular cross-sections perpendicular to a taper junction
axis 394. In some embodiments, the non-circular cross-sectional profile can be an N-sided polygon
with rounded corners, such as the three N-sided polygons illustrated in FIG. 51. Examples of such
cross-sectional profiles include a triangular profile with N = 3, a rectangular profile with N = 4, and a
decagonal profile with N= 10. In some embodiments, the non-circular cross-sectional profile can be a
star shaped polygon (FIG. 51), ellipsoidal (FIG. 51), pear shaped, or any other irregular geometry
(one example of which is shown in FIG. 51). An overall dimension of the non-circular cross-sectional
profile can be defined as a diameter of the largest bounding circle. The overall dimension of the non
circular cross-sectional profile can vary along a length L of the taper junction from a bounding circle
diameter dl of about 5 mm to 35 mm, about 10 mm to 30 mm, about 15 mm to 20 mm, etc. to a
bounding circle diameter d2 of about 6 mm to 40 mm, about 12 mm to 32 mm, about 16 mm to 22
mm, etc. The length L of the taper junction can range from about 5 mm to 45 mm, about 15 mm to 30
mm, about 20 mm to 25 mm, etc. The resulting taper angle k is about 60, but can be in a range of
about 10 to 750, about 50 to 45', about 10' to 250, etc.
[00258] SHAPE MEMORY ALLOY TAPER JUNCTION
[00259] In an exemplary embodiment, fixation of a modular junction can be enhanced by using shape
memory material. For example, shape memory alloys such as Nitinol (Nickel-titanium alloy) exist in
difference crystalline states at different temperatures, a martensitic state below a transition
temperature (State 1) and an austenitic state above the transition temperature (State 2). The change in
state is associated with a change in density, volume, and/or geometry. Additionally, this change can
be either irreversible after crossing the transition temperature (1-way), or allow for repeated switching
between states in response to cycling of the temperature (2-way). Such shape memory properties of
any shape memory material can be utilized to enhance, e.g., tighten and/or strengthen, the fixation of
the modular junction. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that an element being composed of a
                                                    - 43 -

    WO 2014/052768                                                                  PCT/US2013/062203
shape memory material can be composed of a single shape memory material or a combination of any
two or more shape memory materials.
 [00260] In one embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 52A and 52B, a shape memory material (SMM)
sleeve 396 can be interposed between a cavity or female taper surface 398 of a first component (such
as a femoral head) and an outer or male taper surface 400 of a second component (such as a femoral
neck). In State 1 of the SMM sleeve 396, shown in FIG. 52A, the sleeve 396, the first component,
and the second component can be assembled via impaction, as a conventional taper junction. A
transition to State 2 of the SMM sleeve 396, shown in FIG. 52B, can then be imposed via an external
stimulus (e.g., a change in temperature), leading to further tightening of the taper junction.
 [00261] In another embodiment, a sleeve can be composed of at least one SMM, and a cavity or
female taper surface in a first component (e.g., a femoral head) can be composed of two parts, a part
with a positive taper angle and a part with a negative taper angle. FIGS. 53A-53C show an
embodiment of a sleeve 402 composed of at least one SMM, and a cavity or female taper surface 404
in a first component (e.g., a femoral head) composed of two parts, a part with a positive taper angle
406 and a part with a negative taper angle 408 (FIGS. 53B and 53C). The portions with positive and
negative taper angles 406, 408 are angled in an opposite directions relative to a taper junction axis
410. An inner surface of the cavity 404, and the inner and outer surface of the SMM sleeve after
transition from State 1 (FIG. 53A) to State 2 (FIG. 53B), have portions with positive and negative
taper angle. In State 1, the inner and outer surfaces of the SMM sleeve 402 have a positive taper
angle that allows assembly via impaction. A transition to State 2 is then imposed via an external
stimulus, causing the SMM sleeve geometry to change such that the inner and outer surfaces of the
SMM sleeve 402 now have a part positive angle and a part negative taper angle, as shown in FIG.
53B. Additionally the SMM sleeve 402 undergoes a volumetric expansion. This tightens the taper
junction and causes engagement of the outer surface of sleeve 402 with the inner surface of the
femoral head cavity 404. Simultaneously, the portion of the inner surface of the sleeve 402 with
positive taper angle engages with the outer surface of the prosthetic femoral neck 412.
 [00262] FIGS. 54A and 54B illustrate an embodiment of a femoral head-neck taper junction where at
least a portion of a femoral neck is made of a SMM. In the illustrated embodiment, an outer surface
414 of the femoral neck is made of the SMM. In other embodiments, the entire femoral head or
femoral neck can be made of a SMM. In State 1 of the SMM (FIG. 54A), the components forming
the taper junction can be assembled via impaction. A transition to State 2 (FIG. 54B) of the SMM can
then be imposed, to further tighten the taper junction, e.g., by filling more of a femoral head cavity
416 with the femoral neck.
 [00263] FIGS. 55A and 55B illustrate another embodiment of a femoral head-neck taper junction
                                                  - 44 -

    WO 2014/052768                                                                PCT/US2013/062203
where at least a portion of a femoral neck is made of a SMM. In the illustrated embodiment, an outer
surface 418 of the femoral neck is made of the SMM. In this illustrated embodiment, a femoral head
cavity 420 has a surface with part positive taper angle 422 and a part negative taper angle 424, while
the femoral neck is composed of a SMM and has an outer surface with a positive taper angle. In State
1 (FIG. 55A) of the SMM, the femoral head and femoral neck can be assembled via impaction. A
transition to State 2 (FIG. 55B) of the SMM can then be imposed, causing the geometry of the outer
surface 418 of the femoral neck to change to a surface with part positive and part negative taper angle.
Additionally, the SMM sleeve undergoes a volumetric expansion from State 1 to State 2. This tightens
the taper junction and causes engagement of the portions of the femoral neck and femoral head with
the negative taper angles.
