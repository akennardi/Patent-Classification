                                         FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]        The present invention relates to frozen and refrigerated food products and coating
   compositions therefor.
                                     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]         Many food products are provided in frozen or refrigerated ready-to-cook form and
   many such products have texturizers, such as bread crumbs, intended to provide appealing
   crispiness/crunchiness to the cooked products.
[0004]         In many instances, their textural qualities are difficult to reach as a result of cost
   optimized yields; freeze-thaw abuse; frozen or refrigerated storage; food service holding practices,
   including warming cabinets, steam tables and heat lamps; and cooking methods, including
   humidity controlled ovens and microwave reheat.
[0005]         RS4-type resistant starches are chemically-modified, highly-cross-linked starches,
   resistant to digestion by alpha-amylase and are widely used to provide dietary fibre to a wide
   variety of food products, such as bread, to provide a pre-biotic fibre source for gut health. These
   starches may be manufactured by procedures described in US Patent Nos. 5,855,946 and
   6,299,903. Examples of RS4 resistant starches include Fibersym* (MGP), PenFibe TM RS (Penford
   Food Ingredients) and ActiStar* RT (Cargill) resistant starches.

                              GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0040]        The texturizing crumbs provided herein are comprised of a cereal base, such as wheat,
   rice or corn, and contain RS4 resistant starch up to, but not limited to, about 20 wt% of the
                                                   3

   formulation, in one embodiment, up to about 5 wt% of the formulation, in another embodiment,
   from about 5 to about 20 wt% of the formulation, in another embodiment, from about 5 to about
   15 wt% of the formulation, in another embodiment, from about 5 to about 10% wt% of the
   formulation, in another embodiment, from about 10 to about 15 wt% of the formulation, and in
   another embodiment, from about 15 to about 20 wt% of the formulation. HPST extrusion is
   required in conjunction with the RS4 resistant starch to produce crumbs of the present invention
   with the desired textural properties and performance in the finished product application.
[0041]         HPST extrusion technology is a process whereby a food material is forced to flow, under
   one or more varieties of conditions of mixing, heating and shear, through a die which is designed
   to form and/or puff/expand the ingredients (see Rossen, J. L. and Miller, R. C. Food extrusion.
   Food Technol., 1973. 27:46-53). HPST extrusion-cooking is carried out in a food extruder which
   generates large amounts of mechanical energy and shear. Food extruders are machines in which
   the main operative body is one screw or a pair of screws fitted in a barrel. During baro-thermal
   processing (typically pressures of up to about 20MPa and a temperature of about 200 'C), the
   material is mixed compressed, melted and plasticized in the end part of the machine as shown in
   Figure 18, wherein 1 is the engine, 2 is the feeder, 3 is the cooling jacket, 4 is the thermocouple, 5
   is the screw, 6 is the barrel, 7 is the heating jacket, 8 is the head, 9 are the dies, 10 is the cutter,
   Section I is the transport section, Section 11is the compression section, and Section III is the
   melting and plasticizing section [(see Extrusion-Cooking Techniques Applications, Theory and
   Sustainability Edited by Leszek Moscicki - Wiley-VCH (2011) - ISBN: 978-3-527-32888-8)]. At the
   exit of the extruder, the mixed ingredients are forced through openings in a perforated plate or
   die with a design specific to the food and are then cut to a specified size by a rotating knife
   (cutter).
[0042]         Crumbs of the present invention have desirable textural characteristics such as
   crispiness, persistence of crisp and fracturability, which are retained even in coated food systems
   that have been subjected to a variety of stresses including freeze/thaw cycling, extended hold
   times and microwave reconstitution. In contrast, coating crumbs produced with a CMKD process
   do not retain their textural characteristics in stressed coating systems, losing crispness and
   becoming increasingly cohesive in these circumstances.
[0043]         Using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), RS4 containing crumbs of the present
   invention exhibit glass transition temperatures (Tg) between about 50 to about 60*C, even at a
   moisture level of about 44%, which is consistent with moisture levels present in the outer layers of
   coated food items subjected to stress such as freeze/thaw cycling or microwave reheat. The glass
   transition is associated with "glassy" textural attributes such as crispiness and fracturability. The
   magnitude of Tg is reflected in the heat flow change or ACp of the sample. CMKD processed
   crumbs or crumbs produced using the HPST extrusion process of this invention, but without RS4
   content, do not exhibit glass transition states at this moisture level.
[0044]         When examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with 500 to 1000X
   magnification, RS4 containing crumbs of the present invention show a predominantly gelled and
   amorphous matrix due to the high shear of HPST extrusion. Intact resistant starch granules are
   sitting upon this matrix (see Figures land 4 to 6). Crumbs produced in a HPST extrusion process
                                                     4

    but without RS4 do not show intact starch granules (see Figures 2, 3, 7 and 8). CMKD processed
   crumbs exhibit a large amount of intact starch granules, although embedded within a dough
    matrix of proteins, lipids and hydrocolloids (see Figure 9).
[0045]         Cooked viscosity profile analysis using a Rapid-Visco Analyzer (RVA) identifies the degree
   to which starch granules, in this case within the crumb, are able to swell and rupture in a high
    moisture environment when heated to about 95*C. Figures 10 and 12 show differences in cooked
   viscosity profiles of HPST extruded and CMKD processed crumbs. RS4 crumbs of the present (see
    Figure 10) show high initial cold viscosities prior to heating, associated with highly gelatinized
   starch. The subsequent and relative low peak is associated with residual pasting potential and
    influenced by the intact RS4 starch granules. CMKD processed crumbs (see Figure 12) exhibit low
    cold viscosities due to the limited water holding capacity of the intact starch granules. During the
    heating phase, the starch granules of the CMKD processed crumbs take in water, swell, generate a
   significant viscosity peak and then rupture. The difference in water holding capacity on heating
    between HPST extruded RS4 crumbs and the CMKD processed crumbs has important effects on
   the cooked textural characteristics.
[0046]         In a coated food product, long term freezer storage or freeze/thaw cycling has a water
    pumping effect, transferring moisture from substrate and inner coating layers to the outside layer.
   The HPST extruded RS4 containing crumbs of the present invention readily release this moisture
   without altering the state of the intact resistant starch granules, which themselves have poor
   water holding capacity. This results in improved textural properties upon cooking due to the
   ability of the crumbs of the present invention to undergo a glass transition under elevated
    moisture levels. Upon cooking CMKD processed crumbs, moisture is readily absorbed and held as
   the starch granules swell. The moisture is trapped within the crumb matrix and the glass transition
    is negated, resulting in poor textural properties exhibited as a soft and cohesive mass, so often
   associated with freezer storage abuse or microwave reconstitution.
                                                EXAMPLES
  Example 1:
[0047]         This Example illustrates the use of RS4 resistant wheat starch in texturizing crumbs
   through HPST extrusion using a Wenger TX85 model, in accordance with the present invention.
[0048]         Texturizing crumbs were made by extruding the mixture through a Wenger TX85 pilot
    extruder. The twin-screw extruder was configured with an L/D ratio of 13.5 and double cut-flight
    elements within the last three zones. The extrudate was particulated and the crumb products
   generated under varying shear conditions as influenced by die configuration, dry feed rate, added
    moisture, location of water addition and extruder RPM. These conditions influenced motor load
   and head pressure as shown in Table 1.

  [0053]         Trials W120523-008 and 120525-031 contained no RS4 wheat starch. Although they
      were run under significantly different shear conditions, neither exhibited glass transition nor
      showed evidence of intact starch granules as seen by SEM (see Figures 2 and 3). The wheat flour
      base of trials W120523-008 and 120525-031 underwent a complete melt and formed an
      amorphous structure on cooling.
  [0054]         With the addition of 10 and 20% RS4 wheat starch, in accordance with an aspect of the
      present invention, the SEM shows intact starch granules (see Figure 1) and the glass transition
      becomes evident even at 44% moisture. These RS4 formulations exhibit a clear Tg between about
      50 to about 60*C with ACp increasing with the level of RS4.
  [0055]         W120525-031 and W130416-008 were both run with the same front, but different back
      die designs, the former with 60% greater open area compared to the latter. This resulted in
      W130416-008 experiencing significantly more shear, as indicated by the head pressure, and the
      subsequent crumb exhibiting glass transition. W120525-031 did not undergo glass transition.

  [0062]          All trials contained RS4 wheat starch and exhibited clear glass transitions and evidence
      of intact starch granules under varying shear conditions (see Figures 4 to 6). W120525-030 and
      W130417-010 rice-based formulations showed a significant difference in head pressure. Although
      the latter had the lower level of RS4 wheat starch and higher shear, the starch survives these
      conditions. The onset of the rice glass transition was delayed when compared to corn.
  [0063]          In finished product application on chicken nuggets subjected to freeze/thaw cycling and
      microwave reheat, rice-based crumbs with RS4 wheat starch, in accordance with an aspect of the
      present invention, exhibited light crispy textures with little cohesion, while the corn-base with RS4
      wheat starch, also in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, provided some
      crisp/crunch with moderate cohesive character. Rice and corn-based controls without RS4
      provided little or no texture in the abused conditions.

    Example 3:
  [0064]         This Example illustrates the use of a RS4 wheat starch in texturizing crumbs made by
      HPST extrusion using a commercial scale Wenger TX144 model extruder, in accordance with the
      present invention.
  [0065]         Crumbs were made by extruding the mixture through a Wenger TX144 extruder. The
      twin-screw, 3 head extruder was configured with an L/D ratio of 13.5 and double cut-flight
      elements within the last two zones. The extrudate was particulated and the crumb products
      generated under varying shear conditions as influenced by added moisture and extruder RPM.
      These conditions influenced motor load and head pressure as seen in Table 5. Operating
      parameters for a commercial extrusion process were scaled-up from the Wenger TX85 pilot trials
      and did not require as wide a range of study.

  [0077]         In this comparison, trials were run under similar conditions, focusing on the effect of
      alternate starches. These high amylose starches, with some resistance character, did not perform
      the same as the RS4 types under abuse conditions in coating crumb application. SEM analysis
      shows an amorphous matrix, but with no intact starch granules. The high amylose rice starch
      Remy B7 showed good textural and visual attributes on its own or in combination with RS4, but
      only under non-abused conditions. The RVA cooked peak viscosity analysis shows elevated peaks
      in the crumbs containing only added high amylose starch (see Figure 11). This indicates greater
      swelling capacity and the subsequent moisture retention upon heating within these coating
      crumbs, affecting negatively their textural qualities.

[0082]         RS4 wheat resistant starch within the CMKD process does not exert the same effect on
   analytical results or performance characteristics as in the HPST extrusion process. Survival of
    intact native starch granules has the greatest influence and significantly masks any performance
    enhancement by the RS4 starch. No glass transition is observed with the RS4 addition. The RVA
   cooked peak viscosity (see Figure 12) shows the elevated peak as produced by native starch (KB
   8804) and its depression as affected by the dilution with RS4 in the CMKD process (KB 8880 A/B).
   Although the depressed peak is characteristic of HPST extruded crumbs made with RS4 in
   accordance with the present invention, the lack of any cold viscosity in the CMKD processed
   crumbs with RS4 indicates native starch granules are still intact, embedded in the dough matrix,
   available to swell and retain moisture during the cook cycle of the coated product.
[0083]         CMKD processed crumbs with RS4 show no significant improvement in crispiness,
   fracturability or persistence in a stressed coating application on chicken nuggets compared to the
    KB 8804 control without RS4 and negligible texture when compared to HPST extruded RS4
   containing crumbs of the present invention. Additional textural comments focused on an
    increased chalkiness character in CMKD processed crumbs containing RS4.
  Example 6:
[0084]         This Example describes the finished product textural performance of HPST extruded
   crumbs containing RS4 resistant wheat starch, in accordance with the present invention, against
   control crumbs manufactured in a CMKD process.
[0085]         The crumbs were applied in a coating sequence to chicken nuggets using a multi
    lamination pilot process. Both par-fry/freeze and par-fry/cook/freeze processing scenarios were
    investigated to expand versatility for reheat from frozen; oven or microwave. The reheated
    nuggets were evaluated by a panel of professional tasters. Both stressed and non-stressed
    reheated nuggets were evaluated for their textural qualities. The stressed versions had undergone
   freeze-thaw conditions of either a 6-cycle freeze/thaw for 4 hours at 4'C and subsequent re-freeze
   to -25*C, or one cycle of 24 hours at 4'C with subsequent re-freeze to -25*C. Further comparisons
   were also made against products held under continuous frozen storage with no further abuse.
[0086]         Figures 13 to 16 compare the textural performance in a commercial retail (oven cooked)
    application of fully expanded crumbs produced from formulations containing RS4 resistant wheat
   starch with wheat (W120525-022, 10% RS4), corn (W120525-028, 15% RS4) or rice (W120525-029,
    15% RS4) flour bases, in accordance with the present invention, against those produced in a CMKD
                                                   13

   process with wheat flour (KB 8804). Control nuggets for each sample were not stressed, while
   stressed nugget samples underwent 6 freeze/thaw cycles. Crumbs of the present invention with
   wheat resistant starch generally maintained or improved in crispiness and persistence with
   reduced cohesiveness after freeze/thaw abuse while KB 8804 decreased in crispiness and
   persistence. Amongst crumb samples with RS4 resistant wheat starch, the rice based crumb had
   the best overall texture after freeze/thaw abuse, followed by wheat and corn.
[0087]        Tables 20 and 21 summarize the results of formal texture analysis of chicken nuggets
   with HPST extruded commercial scale produced KB 8541 (10% RS4), in accordance with the
   present invention, and CMKD processed KB 8804 after a 30 minute hold post cooking and 6
   freeze/thaw cycles. Results were scored on a 9-point hedonic liking scale for several textural
   attributes.
