   [0001]           This application claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application No. 61/758,186,
   filed January 29, 2013, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their
 5 entirety.
                                                   FIELD
   [0002]           Embodiments disclosed herein generally relate to sieve boxes, and more
   particularly relate to sieve boxes including adjustable nozzle assemblies.
10
                                             BACKGROUND
   [0003]           Sieve boxes contain stationary nozzles that spray a slurry onto the surface of a
   sieve screen. Over time, the slurry wears down the sieve screen at the initial contact point, often
   near the top of the screen, thereby rendering the sieve screen so ineffective that it must be
15 replaced. It is common practice to flip the sieve screen upside down so that the worn area is put
   on the bottom and an unworn area of the sieve screen is brought to the top where the slurry
   spraying occurs. Although this practice may double the life of the sieve screen, it does not
   change the wear of the sieve screen at these specific locations proximate to the top and the
   bottom of the screen. Also, it can be a very time consuming process to remove, re-orient, and
20 re-attach the sieve screen to the sieve box.
   [0004]           Therefore, there is a need for an improved approach to extending the operating
   life of sieve screens.

                                       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [00231           The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings, which
   illustrate specific embodiments. Other embodiments having different structures and operation
   do not depart from the scope of the present disclosure.
 5 [0024]           Certain terminology is used herein for convenience only and is not to be taken as
   a limitation on the embodiments described. For example, words such as "top", "bottom",
   "upper," "lower," "left," "right," "horizontal," "vertical," "upward," and "downward" merely
   describe the configuration shown in the figures. Indeed, the referenced components may be
   oriented in any direction and the terminology, therefore, should be understood as encompassing
10 such variations unless specified otherwise. Throughout this disclosure, where a process or
   method is shown or described, the method may be performed in any order or simultaneously,
   unless it is clear from the context that the method depends on certain actions being performed
   first.
   [00251           Referring to the drawings, where like reference numerals refer to the same or
15 similar parts, FIG. 1 shows a sieve box assembly 100 with a front door panel removed for
   clarity. The sieve box assembly 100 is configured to separate a mixture of solids and/or liquids,
   e.g. a slurry, into one or more components. For example, as the slurry flows through the sieve
   box assembly 100, the solid components of the slurry may be separated out from the liquid
   component of the slurry for further processing. In another example, solid components of a
20 larger size may be separated out from solid components of a smaller size and/or from the liquid
   component of the slurry.
   [0026]           More particularly, the sieve box assembly 100 includes an inlet manifold 10, a
   housing 20, a screen 30, a first outlet 40, a second outlet 45, and a nozzle assembly 50. An inlet
   flow line 5 may be connected to the inlet manifold 10 by a sealed, flanged connection 7 for
25 directing a slurry flow into the sieve box assembly 100. A first end of the nozzle assembly 50 is
   in fluid communication with the inlet manifold, and a second end of the nozzle assembly 50 is in
   fluid communication with the housing 20. The nozzle assembly 50 is configured to inject the
   slurry flow from the inlet manifold 10 into the housing 20. A support block 17 may be used to
   support one or more flexible flow lines 15 of the nozzle assembly 50 that may pass through the
30 support block 17, and to secure the nozzle assembly 50 to the housing 20. The support block 17
   may include a hollow interior (as illustrated in FIG. 6) such that the portion of the flexible flow
   lines 15 extending into the support block 17 can be horizontally and/or vertically movable for
   adjustment of the nozzle assembly 50 as further described herein.
                                                      6

       WO 2014/120712                                                           PCT/US2014/013498
   [00271           The housing 20 may include any support type structure for supporting the nozzle
   assembly 50, the screen 30, and the first and second outlets 40, 45. A base 21 of the housing 20
   may be used to secure and position the sieve box assembly 100 at floor level for ease of access.
   The housing 20 may also include one or more sidewalls 23 to form the support structure. As
 5 stated above, the front door panel is removed for clarity in FIGS. 1-5 to expose the internal
   components of the sieve box assembly 100.
   [0028]           The screen 30 is supported within the housing 20. A sealed, flanged connection
   25 may be used to secure the screen 30 to the inner sidewall surfaces, such as the sidewall 23, of
   the housing 20. One or more support bars or plates 27 (illustrated in FIG. 6) may be used to
10 further support the backside of the screen 30. Before inserting the screen 30 into the housing 20
   or when positioning the screen 30 into the housing 20, the screen 30 may have a curved shape or
   may be curved to a shape that generally corresponds to the angle of injection of the slurry to
   maximize the surface area contact of the slurry with the screen 30.
   [0029]           The screen 30 is configured to separate the slurry into one or more components.
15 The screen 30 may include a plurality of spaced apart, screen elements arranged to permit
   liquids and/or solids of a smaller size to pass through the screen 30, while preventing solids of a
   larger size from passing through the screen 30, thereby separating the slurry into one or more
   components. In one embodiment, such screens may include wire with a substantially triangular
   cross-section, and may include Vee-Wire@ type screens (VEE-WIRE is a registered trademark
20 of Bilfinger Water Technologies, Inc.) or wedge wire type screens. In one embodiment, such
   screens may include plates having perforations, slots, and/or other filter-type openings. In one
   embodiment, the wires and plate openings may be oriented symmetrically, asymmetrically,
   horizontally, vertically, tangentially, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the spacing
   and sizes of wires and plate openings vary along the lengths of such screens. In one
25 embodiment, such screens may include one or any combination of filter wires, plates, features
   with perforations, features that otherwise provide a plurality of filter-type openings, and flow
   control vanes. Such screens may include embodiments like those disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
   6,663,774, filed on October 16, 2001, specifically with respect to the filter wires 28 and the
   support rods 20 described therein, and embodiments like those disclosed in U.S. Patent No.

   17 described therein, the contents of both of which patents are herein incorporated by reference
   in their entirety.
   [0030]           When the slurry is injected onto the screen 30, the components of the slurry that
   cannot flow through the screen 30 may be directed to the first outlet 40, and the components of
                                                      7

   the slurry that flow through the screen 30 may be directed to the second outlet 45. The first and
   second outlets 40, 45 are configured to collect and direct the separate slurry components to the
   two outlet flow lines 8, 9, respectively. The outlet flow lines 8, 9 may be coupled to the first and
   second outlets 40, 45 by sealed, flanged connections 43, 47, respectively, to direct the separate
 5 slurry components for further processing. The first and second outlets 40, 45 may be coupled to
   and extend below the base 21 of the housing 20.
   [0031]           FIG. 2 illustrates the nozzle assembly 50. One or more clamps 16 may be used to
   connect a first end of each of the flow lines 15 to the inlet manifold 10, and may be used to
   connect a second end of each of the flow lines 15 to one or more nozzles 53. Although five flow
10 lines 15 and nozzles 53 are illustrated, the nozzle assembly 50 may include any number flow

   [0032]           FIG. 3 illustrates a support assembly that provides an adjustment mechanism of
   the nozzle assembly 50 according to one embodiment. A plate member or plate 55 (or other
   similar support structure) may be coupled to the nozzles 53. One example of an alternative to
20 the plate 55 is a frame with cross-members. A first rod 52 or first elongated support member (or
   another similar elongated member, such as a rectangular bar or rail structure) and a second rod
   59 or second elongated support member (or another similar elongated member, such as a
   rectangular bar or rail structure) may be coupled to the plate member 52 by one or more support
   collars 51, 57 (or other similar support rings) respectively. The first rod 52 and the second rod
25 59 each have a respective longitudinal axis, and may be parallel or substantially parallel. In
   some embodiments a plate or elongated members may be provide while omitting collars.
   [0033]           The collars 51, 57 each define an opening and may have a substantially round
   circumference as shown or other shape at their periphery, for example, square. The collars 51,
   57 may be fixed to the plate member 52, by means such as a welded connection or other
30 mounting methods, but the collars 51, 57 may be laterally and/or rotatably movable relative to
   the first and second rods 52, 59. Adjustable, rotatable engagement members or knobs 58 may be
   threadedly coupled to opposite sides of the second rod 59 for adjusting the nozzle assembly 50
   as further described below. The result in some embodiments is that the second rod 59 may
   pivot 61 about the first rod 52, the collars 51, 57 (with the plate 55 and nozzle 53) translate 62
                                                      8

       WO 2014/120712                                                           PCT/US2014/013498
   along the rods 52, 59, or both, to adjust the nozzle 53 discharge or spray angle and/or lateral
   position. In some embodiments, one or more of nozzle pitch, yaw, and axial (roll) rotational
   movement of a plurality of nozzles relative to the support collars and elongated support
   members may be made.
 5 [0034]           FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate the sieve box assembly 100 with the support block 17 and
   the sidewall 23 removed for clarity of the nozzle assembly 50. As illustrated, the first rod 52
   may be secured within the housing 20, and in particular may be coupled at opposite ends to the
   sidewalls of the housing 20, such as the sidewall 23. The second rod 59 may be similarly
   secured within the housing 20. One method to couple the first rod 52 to the sidewall 23 is to
10 provide a flanged socket at each end of the first rod 52 that is attached to the sidewall 23 with a
   first rod end received in the socket. However, the ends of the second rod 59 and/or the
   adjustable knobs 58 may extend through slots 24 (or other similar openings) formed in the
   sidewalls 23 of the housing 20 such that the adjustable knobs 58 are accessible from the exterior
   of the housing 20.
15 [00351           Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, one of the adjustable knobs 58 is disposed external to
   the sidewall 23 such that the adjustable knobs 58 and the second rod 59 can be moved within a
   slot 24 (or other similar opening) formed in the sidewall 23. A corresponding slot and
   adjustable knob may be provided on the sidewall opposite to sidewall 23. Although the slot 24
   is represented in FIGS. 1 and 4 as straight and vertical, depending on the design desired, the slot
20 24 may be other than straight, such as curved, and other than vertical. To adjust the angle that
   the nozzle assembly 50 sprays the slurry onto the screen 30, the second rod 59 may be moved
   within the slot 24, which will move the plate member 55 and thus the nozzles 53 connected
   thereto. The collars 51, 57 that are secured to the plate member 55 may rotate about the first and
   second rods 52, 59 to permit the adjustment of the nozzle assembly 50 relative to the rods and/or
25 the housing 20.
   [00361           Since the adjustable knobs 58 are threaded into the second rod 59, the adjustable
   knobs 58 may be tightened to secure the second rod 59 in a desired position within the slot 24
   and relative to the housing 20 by rotating the knobs 58 to advance the knobs 58 toward and into
   engagement with the sidewalls of the housing 20. The knobs 58 may be rotated in an opposite
30 direction to loosen the engagement with the sidewalls of the housing 20, and may be used to re
   position and re-secure the second rod 59 in another position within the slot 24. Other manual
   and/or automated drive type mechanisms may be used to adjust the angular position of the
   nozzle assembly 50. In this manner, the nozzle assembly 50 may be adjusted to position the
   slurry spray angle at an angle relative to the screen 30 to maximize operating efficiency, e.g. the
                                                       9

       WO 2014/120712                                                           PCT/US2014/013498
   efficiency of the screen 30 filtering and/or separating the components of the slurry. In one
   embodiment, the nozzle assembly 50 may be operable to adjust the slurry spray at an angle
   substantially tangent to the surface of the screen 30. In one embodiment, the nozzle assembly
   50 may be adjusted to spray the slurry onto the screen 30 to maximize fluid shear of the slurry as
 5 is flows over the screen 30.
   [00371           Alternatively or in addition to the angular adjustment, the nozzle assembly 50
   may be adjusted and moved laterally, which often means horizontally, relative to the screen 30.
   The nozzle assembly 50 may be repositioned along the width of the screen 30 so that the slurry
   spray does not wear the screen 30 in any specific horizontal location. In particular, the nozzles
10 53 may be moved collectively along the length of the first and second rods 52, 59 via the collars
   51, 57 and the plate member 55. In one embodiment, the nozzle assembly 50 may be manually
   repositioned by an operator. In one embodiment, a screw-drive type mechanism (such as with
   an acme-type thread) may be used to adjust the lateral position of the nozzle assembly 50. Other
   manual and/or automated drive type mechanisms may be used to adjust the position of the
15 nozzle assembly 50. In one example, the first rod 52 may include external threads that engage
   internal threads of the collars 51, such that rotation of the first rod 52 may drive the collars 51
   and thus the plate member 55 and the nozzles 53 laterally relative to the screen 30. The ends of
   the first rod 52 may extend outside of the housing 20 so that the nozzle assembly 50 can be
   adjusted laterally from the exterior of the housing 20. In this manner, the nozzle assembly 50
20 may be operable to adjust the location that the slurry is sprayed onto the screen 30 to prevent
   wear of the screen 30 in one specific location and to increase the screen 30 operating life,
   without having to remove and reorient the screen 30.
   [00381           In one embodiment, angular adjustment and/or lateral position of the nozzle
   assembly 50 may be actuated using an actuator disposed external to the housing 20. In one
25 embodiment, angular adjustment and/or lateral position of the nozzle assembly 50 may be
   operable using an automated process.
   [00391           FIG. 6 illustrates a section view along line B-B as shown in FIG. 5. As
   illustrated, a slurry 60 flows into the inlet manifold 10 and then through at least one of the flow
   lines 15 of the nozzle assembly 50. The slurry 60 is injected onto the screen 30 to separate a
30 first component 65 and a second component 67 of the slurry 60. The first component 65 may
   include one or more solid materials having a particle size incapable of passing through the
   screen 30. The first component 65 is directed over or flows along the surface of the screen 30
   such that the injection velocity and/or gravity forces the first component 65 to the first outlet 40.
   The second component 67 may include one or more fluids or solid materials having a particle
                                                      10

   size capable of passing through the screen 30. The second component 65 is directed over or
   flows through the screen 30 such that the injection velocity and/or gravity forces the second
   component 67 to the second outlet 45. The sieve box assembly 100 can be used with any type
   or composition of slurry for separating the slurry into one or more components. In one
 5 embodiment, the housing 20 may be partially or fully sealed, and may be partially or fully
   pressurized with a gas, such as carbon dioxide, to assist with the flow of the slurry through the
   housing 20 to the first and second outlets 40, 45.
   [0040]          In some embodiments, one or more sieve box assemblies 100 may be coupled to
   or positioned adjacent to one or more other sieve box assemblies 100 to form a bank or group of
10 sieve box assemblies. In some embodiments, the sieve box assembly 100 may include one or
   more screens 30 positioned within a single, unitary housing 20 or within a plurality of housings
   20 coupled together and/or separated by one or more sidewalls 23. In some embodiments, the
   sieve box assembly 100 may include one or more nozzle assemblies 50 and/or one or more inlet
   manifolds 10 for distributing slurry flow to the one or more nozzle assemblies 50. For example,
15 a sieve box 100 may have more than one screen 30 in it, and each screen 30 could have one or
   more nozzle assemblies 50 associated with it. In some embodiments, the sieve box assembly
   100 may include one or more first and/or second outlets 40, 45. Embodiments of the sieve box
   assembly 100 and nozzle assembly 50 include one or more combinations, in whole or part, of
   the embodiments described herein.
