                                      1- INTRODUCTION
[0001]       Provided herein are prokaryotic cells proficient to produce glycoconjugates in
vivo, as well as methods for generating these cell and methods of using these cells to produce
glycoconjugates. The compositions of the mentioned glycoconjugates as well as their
different uses are also included.
                                       2-BACKGROUND
[0002]       Glycosylation is a process by which carbohydrate molecules or sugars
(monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, or polysaccharides) are attached to the
side chains of different amino acids residues in a protein or polypeptide to generate a
glycoprotein.
[0003]       Glycoproteins are involved in several processes such as, cellular interaction and
cell signaling; they participate in protein folding, oligomerization, stability, quality control,
sorting and transport of secretory and membrane proteins. Protein glycosylation has a
profoundly favorable influence on the antigenicity, the stability and the half-life of a protein.
[0004]       There are different sort of glycoproteins depending of the type of linkage between
the carbohydrate molecules and the amino acid residue in the protein carrier.
[0005]       N-linked protein glycosylation -the addition of carbohydrate molecules to an
asparagine residue in the polypeptide chain of the target protein- is the most common type of
post-translational modification occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic
organisms. The process is accomplished by the enzymatic oligosaccharyltransferase complex
(OST) responsible for the transfer of a preassembled oligosaccharide from a lipid carrier
(dolichol phosphate) to an asparagine residue of a nascent protein within the conserved

 sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X is any amino acid except proline) in the Endoplamic
 reticulum. The saccharide chain is then subject to other modifications in the Golgi apparatus.
 The N-linked glycosylation process occurs in eukaryotes and widely in archaea, but very
 rarely in bacteria (see below).
 [0006[       O-linked glycosylation is a form of glycosylation that occurs in eukaryotes,
 archaea and bacteria. It consists in the attachment of a sugar molecule to an oxygen atom in
 an amino acid residue in the protein target.
 [0007[       It has been shown that a bacterium, the food-borne pathogen Campylobacter
jejuni, can also N-glycosylate its proteins (Wacker et al., Science. 2002; 298(5599):1790-3)
 due to the fact that it possesses its own glycosylation machinery. The machinery responsible
 of this reaction is encoded by a cluster called pgl (forprotein glycosylation).
 [0008[       The C. jejuni glycosylation machinery can be transferred to E. coli to allow for the
 glycosylation of recombinant proteins expressed by the E. coli cells. Previous studies have
 demonstrated how to generate E. coli strains that can perform N-glycosylation (see, e.g.,

 [0009[       Bacteria can be divided in two groups, Gram-positive and Gram-negative,
 depending if they have either a single or double sheath cell membrane that is often surrounded
 by capsular polysaccharides. Examples for such bacteria include Streptococcus ssp.,
Pseudomonas ssp., Neisseria ssp., Salmonella ssp., Escherichiassp., Staphylococcus ssp.,
 Campylobacter ssp., etc. One of the medically and commercially most relevant infectious
 agent is Streptococcuspneumoniae, a Gram-positive pathogen.
 [0010[       S. pneumoniae is the major cause of both mild and severe infections worldwide.
 The primary clinical syndromes associated with pneumococcal infections are pneumonia,
 meningitis, bloodstream infections and acute otitis media, with pneumonia being the most
 important of these in terms of morbidity and mortality. Infections caused by S. pneumoniae
 are responsible for substantial disease burden particularly in the very young and in the elderly
 (Isaacman DJ, M. E., Reinert RR. 2010. Burden of invasive pneumococcal disease and
 serotype distribution among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in young children in Europe:

 WO 2014/072405                                                              PCT/EP2013/073266

conjugate vaccines. Int JInfect Dis. 14:197-209).
 [0011[      Pneumococci are grouped into several serotypes (- 93) on the basis of their
chemically and serologically distinct capsular polysaccharides. Certain serotypes are more
abundant than others, to be associated with clinically apparent infections, to cause severe
invasive infections and to acquire resistance to one or more classes of antibacterial agents
(Rueda, A. M. M., MSc; Serpa, Jose A. MD; Matloobi, Mahsa MD; Mushtaq, Mahwish MD;
Musher, Daniel M. MD. 2010. The spectrum of invasive pneumococcal disease at an adult
tertiary care hospital in the early 21st century. Medicine (Baltimore) 89:331-336). Distinct
serotypes of S. pneumoniae have been identified based on structural differences in the
polysaccharide capsule. According to previous analyses approximately 10 or 11 serotypes
account for over 70% of invasive pediatric infections in all regions of the world (Hausdorff
WP, Bryant J, Paradiso PR, Siber GR: Which pneumococcal serogroups cause the most
invasive disease: implications for conjugate vaccine formulation and use, part I. Clinical
infectious diseases: an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society ofAmerica 2000,
30(1):100-121). The distribution of serotypes causing disease varies by age, disease
syndrome, disease severity, geographic region, and over time. Pneumococci that are resistant
to penicillin, erythromycin, co-trimoxazole or multiple drugs are common in many regions
(Evolving trends in Streptococcuspneumoniae resistance: implications for therapy of
community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Jones RN, Jacobs MR, Sader HS. Int JAntimicrob
Agents. 2010 Sep;36(3):197-204)
 [0012[      The pneumococcal capsule is one of the main bacterial virulence factors and has
been successfully used as antigen in various vaccines. Antibodies against the capsular
polysaccharide have been shown to be protective against pneumococcal infection (Musher
DM PH, Watson DA, Baughn RE: Antibody to capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus
pneumoniae at the time of hospital admission for Pneumococcal pneumonia. JInfect Dis
2000, 182(1):158-167, Isaacman DJ ME, Reinert RR: Burden of invasive pneumococcal

in Europe: impact of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and considerations for
future conjugate vaccines. Int JInfect Dis 2010, 14(3):197-209)
 [0013[      The pathways of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides (CPS) synthesis differ
depending on the serotype (- 93). With the exception of types 3 and 37, which are
synthesized by the synthase pathway (Bentley SD, Aanensen DM, Mavroidi A, Saunders D,

analysis of the capsular biosynthetic locus from all 90 pneumococcal serotypes. PLoS genetics
2006, 2(3):e3 1) pneumococcal CPSs are generally synthesized by the O-Antigen-Flippase
(Wzx)/Polymerase (Wzy) -dependent pathway (FIG. 1).
[0014[       CPSs are assembled from common precursors (e.g. nucleotide activated
monosaccharides) on carrier lipids by a step-wise approach. First, the repeat unit is
assembled on the carrier at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane by different
glycosyltransferases. The lipid-linked oligosaccharide is then flipped to outer side of the
membrane where the repeating units are polymerized. The complete CPS is released from the
carrier lipid and exported to the surface.
[0015[       Bacterial polysaccharides can elicit a long-lasting immune response in humans if
they are coupled to a protein carrier that contains T-cell epitopes. This concept was
elaborated almost 100 years ago (Avery, 0. T., and W. F. Goebel, 1929. Chemo
immunological studies on conjugated carbohydrate-proteins. Immunological specificity of
synthetic sugar-proteins. J. Exp. Med. 50:521-533), and proven later for the polysaccharide
of Haemophilus influenza type B (HIB) coupled to the protein carrier diphtheria toxin
(Anderson, P. 1983. Antibody responses to Haemophilus influenzae type b and diphtheria
toxin induced by conjugates of oligosaccharides of the type b capsule with the nontoxic
protein CRM197. Infect Immun 39:233-8; Schneerson, R., 0. Barrera, A. Sutton, and J. B.
Robbins. 1980. Preparation, characterization, and immunogenicity of Haemophilus
influenzae type b polysaccharide-protein conjugates. JExp Med 152:361-76). This
glycoconjugate was also the first conjugated vaccine to be licensed in the USA in 1987 and
introduced into the US infant immunization schedule shortly thereafter. Besides HIB,
conjugated vaccines have been successfully developed against the encapsulated human
pathogens Neisseria meningitidis and S. pneumoniae. Routine use of these vaccines has
resulted in decreased nasopharyngeal colonization, as well as infection. Currently -25% of
the global vaccine market comprises conjugated vaccines.
[0016[       Conjugate vaccines have been successfully used to protect against bacterial
infections. The conjugation of an antigenic polysaccharide to a protein carrier is required for
protective memory response, as polysaccharides are T-cell independent antigens.
Polysaccharides have been conjugated to protein carriers by different chemical methods,
using activation reactive groups in the polysaccharide as well as the protein carrier
(Pawlowski, A., G. Kallenius, and S. B. Svenson. 2000. Preparation of pneumococcal

 WO 2014/072405                                                                PCT/EP2013/073266

conjugation technologies. Vaccine 18:1873-1885; Robbins, J. B., J. Kubler-Kielb, E.
Vinogradov, C. Mocca, V. Pozsgay, J. Shiloach, and R. Schneerson. 2009. Synthesis,
characterization, and immunogenicity in mice of Shigella sonnei 0-specific oligosaccharide
core-protein conjugates. Proc Natl Acad Sci US A 106:7974-7978).
[0017[      Conjugate vaccines can be administered to children to protect them against
bacterial infections and can provide a long lasting immune response to adults. Constructs of
the invention have been found to generate an IgG response in animals. It is believed that the
polysaccharide (i.e. sugar residue) triggers a short-term immune response that is sugar
specific. Indeed, the human immune system generates a strong response to specific
polysaccharide surface structures of bacteria, such as O-antigens and capsular
polysaccharides. However, as the immune response to polysaccharides is IgM dependent, the
immune system develops no memory. The protein carrier that carries the polysaccharide,
however, triggers an IgG response that is T-cell dependent and that provides long lasting
protection since the immune system develops memory. For this reason, it is advantageous to
develop a vaccine as a protein carrier - polysaccharide conjugate.
[0018[      The inability of pure pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines to induce a protective
immune response for important serotypes in young children precludes their consideration for
infant immunization.
[0019[      To date, vaccines against pneumococcal disease are synthesized in vitro by a well
established chemical conjugation technology. Antigenic capsular polysaccharides are
extracted from pathogenic organisms, purified, chemically activated and conjugated to a
suitable protein carrier. Currently, there are different protein carriers used to produce the
glycoconjugates e.g. CRM 197 (diphtheria toxoid), tetanus toxoid, and Hemophilus influenzae
protein D.
[0020[      A 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) has been licensed several
years ago and it has been recommended for use in developing countries with high disease
burden by WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) (Vaccine 2012 Jul
6;30(32):4717-8. Epub 2012 May 20. Pneumococcal vaccines WHO position paper - 2012
recommendations. WHO Publication). A 10-valent (PCV1O) and a 13- valent (PCV13)
conjugate vaccine have been licensed as well in various countries. Additional conjugate
vaccines are at different stages of development (Jiang SM, Wang L and Reeves PR:

 [0021[      Several problems have been identified in the context of the manufacturing of
chemical conjugate vaccines. Chemical treatment of polysaccharides for conjugation has
been shown to impair the natural conformation of the polysaccharide influencing the quality
of the antigens, consequently, affecting the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the final
product (Impact of the conjugation method on the immunogenicity of Streptococcus
pneumoniae serotype 19F polysaccharide in conjugate vaccines (Poolman J, Frasch C, Nurkka

                           3- SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 [0022[      This invention describes a novel method to produce glycoconjugate vaccines that
contain polysaccharides from pneumococcal cells. This innovative pneumococcal vaccine is
based on the discovery that regulatory genes involved in oligo - or polysaccharide
biosynthesis of a Gram-positive bacteria can be used to efficiently synthetize oligo- and
polysaccharides in a Gram-negative host strain, and that the oligo- or polysaccharide
produced in this way can be used to make a glycoconjugate vaccine in the Gram-negative host
cells. Further novel and unexpected features of the invention include without limitation the
embodiments set forth below.
 [0023[      The presented invention describes an original procedure for the production of
pneumococcal polysaccharide based conjugate vaccines. The procedure is based on various
steps:
 [0024[      i) Recombinant production of pneumococcal polysaccharides as undecaprenyl
pyrophosphate (Und-PP) linked 0 antigen like polysaccharides in E. coli using regulatory
genes that enhance production efficiency of polysaccharides.
 [0025[      ii) Development of a suitable production strain by deleting specific functions of
the initial strain to make the polysaccharide production more efficient.
 [0026[      iii) Design of suitable DNA constructs that allow the efficient, recombinant
synthesis of pneumococcal polysaccharides in E. coli.
 [0027[      iv) A method for efficient conjugation in vivo of polysaccharides to an acceptor
protein by an oligosaccharyltransferase.

                5- DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 [0052[     Pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides are synthetized on carrier lipids by the
collaboration of a set of enzymes typically encoded in the CPS cluster of S. pneumoniae cells
(Whitfield C, Roberts IS: Structure, assembly and regulation of expression of capsules in
Escherichia coli. Mol Microbiol 1999, 31(5):1307-1319). The synthesis of wzy dependent
CPS starts with the addition of a monosaccharide-phosphate to undecaprenylphosphate (Und
P) at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. A short oligosaccharide is elongated by
sequential addition of monosaccharides from activated sugar nucleotides by different
glycosyltransferases and the lipid-linked polysaccharide is flipped through the membrane by a
flippase. The antigen-repeating unit (RU) is polymerized by an enzymatic reaction performed

 WO 2014/072405                                                               PCT/EP2013/073266
                                               12
by the protein wzy. The polysaccharide is then transferred to the final acceptor structure.
Polymerization and transport to the cell surface is believed to be controlled by a set of 3 to 4
enzymes which are located at the 5' end of the CPS clusters.
[0053[      Glycosyltransferases, polymerase wzy, flippase wzx, and the monosaccharide
phosphate transferases are encoded in most cases within the dexB to aliA cluster, whereas
nucleotide activated monosaccharide biosynthetic pathways are encoded either elsewhere in
the genome in the case of general housekeeping activities, and specifically within the CPS
cluster when the monosaccharides are specific for the CPS (Bentley SD, Aanensen DM,
Mavroidi A, Saunders D, Rabbinowitsch E, Collins M, Donohoe K, Harris D, Murphy L,
Quail MA et al: Genetic analysis of the capsular biosynthetic locus from all 90 pneumococcal
serotypes. PLoS genetics 2006, 2(3):e3 1).
[0054[      Length control in CPS biosynthesis is believed to involve a circle of
phosphorylation events for regulation (Morona JK, Miller DC, Morona R, Paton JC. The
effect that mutations in the conserved capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis genes have on
virulence of Streptococcuspneumoniae. JInfect Dis. 2004 May 15; 189(10):1905-13.Epub
2004 Apr 27. PubMed PMID: 15122528). Most biosynthetic pathways producing CPS use
nucleotide diphosphate (NDP) activated monosaccharides as substrates, namely this is UDP
Glc and UDP-GlcNAc. These NDP sugars are provided in Gram-negative and Gram-positive
hosts by housekeeping genes, and thus are available as starting materials for synthesis of
specific sugars. Biosynthetic genes for synthesis of specific NDP-sugars or other
modifications are almost always encoded in CPS clusters.
[0055[      0 antigen synthesis and CPS synthesis differ at the last step of biosynthesis. 0
antigen is added to the Lipid A core by the ligase WaaL and is further transported to the outer
membrane, whereas CPS is present as a capsular structure on the cells. In average, the final 0
antigen sugar length is much shorter than CPS.
[0056[      S. pneumoniae CPS is classified as group I CPS due to the specific biochemical
pathways leading to its synthesis. Gram-negative bacteria also contains group I CPS
pathways, which differ from pneumococcal group I clusters by the presence of additional
membrane transporter protein genes responsible for outer membrane transport. For example,
these are the colanic acid (CA) biosynthetic machinery gene clusters wca, (Stevenson G,

cluster responsible for production of the extracellular polysaccharide colanic acid. JBacteriol

1996, 178(16):4885-4893) and the K30 CPS cluster (Whitfield C: Biosynthesis and assembly
of capsular polysaccharides in Escherichiacoli. Annu Rev Biochem 2006, 75:39-68).
[0057[      However, despite the fact that some Gram-negative and positive capsular
polysaccharide clusters were similar in functional elements, there was never an entire
pneumococcal CPS cluster functionally expressed in E. coli. It is generally accepted that the
different cell envelope architecture requires specific machinery for polysaccharide production,
which is different when an outer membrane must be crossed. Thus described herein are
improved production methods of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides using i) aspects of
the LPS and capsular polysaccharide pathways in a Gram-negative organism and ii) aspects of
the Gram-positive capsular biosynthesis regulation and transport pathways in combination
within Gram-negative host cells. Such polysaccharides are produced by LPS pathway
mechanisms in the Gram-negative host, the structure of such polysaccharides are the same as
LPS polysaccharides. Such polysaccharides produced in Gram-negative systems of the
instant invention can be characterized, therefore, as "modified capsular polysaccharides" or
"LPS capsules" for purposes of this application. Furthermore, this newly synthesized
expression system and biosynthetic pathway, which combines the LPS and capsular
biosynthetic pathways, may be characterized as being a "modified LPS biosynthetic pathway"
for purposes of this application.
[0058[      Accordingly, an additional embodiment involves an S. pneumoniae vaccine made
by a glycosylation system using a modified LPS pathway, which comprises the production of
a modified capsular polysaccharide or LPS-capsule.
[0059[      Another specific embodiment of the invention involves the optimization of the
gram negative E. coli host cell genome for optimized expression of the pneumococcal CPS. E.
coli W3 110 encodes a prophage gene cluster called gtr. The Gtr enzymes GtrA, B, and S
encode a machinery that modifies 0 antigens by adding branching glucose residues to the
growing 0 antigen chain in the periplasmic space (Lehane AM, Korres H, Verma NK:
Bacteriophage-encoded glucosyltransferase GtrII of Shigella flexneri: membrane topology
and identification of critical residues. The Biochemical journal 2005, 389(Pt 1):137-143).
The pathway involves the generation of undecaprenylphosphate (Und-P, not Und-PP) linked
glucose on the cytoplasmic face of the cell membrane, flipping to the periplasm, and
consecutive transfer of the Und-P-linked glucose to the growing 0 antigen polysaccharide.
[0060[      In certain embodiments, the gtrABS genes are partially or completely functionally
inactivated or deleted from the Gram-negative host cell, e.g, gtrABS are deleted in an E. coli

 WO 2014/072405                                                             PCT/EP2013/073266
                                               14
host cell. Without being bound by theory, such deletion channels all CPS biosynthetic
activity to the glycosylation accessible Und-PP pathway and thereby enhances glycoprotein
production. Many pneumococcal polysaccharides are synthesized as repeat unit (RU)
polymers with glucose as the initiating monosaccharide. Thus, such repeat units may interfere
with glycosylation of proteins as they are assembled on Und-P.
[0061[       Another specific embodiment is the enhancement of Und-PP-linked CPS
production by increasing the expression and activity of UDP-glucose:undecaprenyl phosphate
glucose-phosphate transferase activity, which increases the Und-PP-Glc amounts in the cells
and thus leads to enhanced production efficiency of CPS repeat unit (RU) and
polysaccharides. Examples for such UDP-glucose:undecaprenyl phosphate glucose
phosphate transferases is the WchA of S. pneumoniae (i.e. the natural enzyme providing the
initiator function) or the WcaJ encoded in the E. coli W3 110 colanic acid wca operon. A
specific embodiment of the invention is the replacement of the natural S. pneumoniae wchA
gene function by the E. coli function encoded in the wcaJ gene for optimizing glycolipid
production performance.
[0062[       Another embodiment of the invention is the genomic integration of the
recombinant CPS cluster in place of the E. coli W3 110 wca operon for stable and high yield
glycolipid production, and for enhanced glycosylation activity.
Regulatory Genes
[0063[       Various regulatory genes of capsular polysaccharide gene clusters of Gram
positive bacteria can be used with the methods and host cells of the present invention. In
specific embodiments, the regulatory gene is wzg, wzh, wzd, or wze of a capsular
polysaccharide gene cluster of S. pneumoniae, or capA, capB, or capC of a capsular
polysaccharide gene cluster of S. aureus or CpsA, CpsB, CpsC, or CpsD of a capsular

provided herein such that a desired capsular polysaccharide is synthesized in the host cell.
See, e.g., International Patent Application Application No. WO 2011/138361, which is hereby
incorporated by reference in its entirety.
Bioconjugates
[0067[       In certain embodiments of the present invention, the host cell is further modified to
generate a bioconjugate, i.e., a carrier protein that is glycosylated with the capsular protein
generated in the host cell. Transfer of the capsular polysaccharide onto the carrier protein is
catalyzed by an oligosaccharyltransferase. In certain embodiments, an
oligosaccharyltransferase is recombinantly expressed in the host cell. In certain
embodiments, an oligosaccharyltransferase is introduced into the prokaryotic host. The
oligosaccharyltransferases can be from any source, and may include heterologous
oligosaccharyltransferases, i.e., oligosaccharyltransferases derived from a different organism
than the prokaryotic host cell (e.g., oligosaccharyltransferases derived from a different
bacterial species). In a specific embodiment, the oligosaccharyltransferase is from a
Campylobacter species, e.g., C. jejuni.
[0068[       The carrier protein can be a recombinant protein. In certain embodiments, the
carrier protein is a protein that naturally comprises one or more N-glycosylation consensus

sequences. In other embodiments, one or more N-glycosylation consensus sequences have
been recombinantly introduced into the carrier protein. Any carrier protein suitable for use in
the production of conjugate vaccines can be used herein. Exemplary carrier proteins include,
without limitation, Exotoxin A of P. aeruginosa(EPA), CRM197, Diphtheria toxoid, tetanus
toxoid, detoxified hemolysin A of S. aureus, clumping factor A of S. aureus, clumping factor
B of S. aureus, E. coli FimH, E. coli FimHC, E. coli heat labile enterotoxin, detoxified
variants of E. coli heat labile enterotoxin, Cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), cholera toxin,
detoxified variants of cholera toxin, E. coli Sat protein, the passenger domain of E. coli Sat
protein, C. jejuni AcrA, and C. jejuni natural glycoproteins, S. pneumoniae pneumolysin and
additional S. pneumoniae protein antigens, e.g., S. pneumoniae NOX, S. pneumoniae PspA, S.
pneumoniae PcpA, S. pneumoniae PhtD, S. pneumoniae PhtE, S. pneumoniae Ply, and S.
pneumoniae LytB.
 [0069[      In certain embodiments, the carrier proteins used in the generation of the
conjugates described herein are modified, e.g., modified in such a way that the protein is less
toxic and or more susceptible to glycosylation, etc. In a specific embodiment, the carrier
proteins used in the generation of the conjugate vaccines described herein are modified such
that the number of glycosylation sites in the carrier proteins is maximized in a manner that
allows for lower concentrations of the protein to be administered, e.g., in an immunogenic
composition, in its bioconjugate form. Accordingly in certain embodiments, the carrier
proteins described herein are modified to include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more
glycosylation sites than would normally be associated with the carrier protein (e.g., relative to
the number of glycosylation sites associated with the carrier protein in its native/natural, e.g.,
"wild-type" state). In specific embodiments, introduction of glycosylation sites is
accomplished by insertion of glycosylation consensus sequences anywhere in the primary
structure of the protein. Introduction of such glycosylation sites can be accomplished by, e.g.,
adding new amino acids to the primary structure of the protein (i.e., the glycosylation sites are
added, in full or in part), or by mutating existing amino acids in the protein in order to
generate the glycosylation sites (i.e., amino acids are not added to the protein, but selected
amino acids of the protein are mutated so as to form glycosylation sites). Those of skill in the
art will recognize that the amino acid sequence of a protein can be readily modified using
approaches known in the art, e.g., recombinant approaches that include modification of the
nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein. In specific embodiments, glycosylation
consensus sequences are introduced into specific regions of the carrier protein, e.g., surface
structures of the protein, at the N or C termini of the protein, and/or in loops that are stabilized

 WO 2014/072405                                                                PCT/EP2013/073266
                                                 17
by disulfide bridges at the base of the protein. In certain embodiments, the classical 5 amino
acid glycosylation consensus sequence may be extended by lysine residues for more efficient
glycosylation, and thus the inserted consensus sequence may encode 5, 6, or 7 amino acids
that should be inserted or that replace acceptor protein amino acids.
[0070[      In certain embodiments, the carrier proteins used in the generation of the conjugate
vaccines described herein comprise a "tag," i.e., a sequence of amino acids that allows for the
isolation and/or identification of the carrier protein. For example, adding a tag to a carrier
protein described herein can be useful in the purification of that protein and, hence, the
purification of conjugate vaccines comprising the tagged carrier protein. Exemplary tags that
can be used herein include, without limitation, histidine (HIS) tags (e.g., hexa histidine-tag, or
6XHis-Tag), FLAG-TAG, and HA tags. In certain embodiments, the tags used herein are
removable, e.g., removal by chemical agents or by enzymatic means, once they are no longer
needed, e.g., after the protein has been purified.
[0071[      In certain embodiments, the bacterial host cells described herein and the
conjugates produced by such bacterial host cells described herein possess advantageous
properties. For example, in certain embodiments, the bacterial host cells described herein,
which comprise regulatory genes derived from Gram-positive bacteria, wherein said
regulatory genes are involved in oligo- or polysaccharide biosynthesis, are able to produce
sugar antigens, e.g., oligo- and/or polysaccharides, of increased length as a result of the
presence of said regulatory genes. In addition, the bacterial host cells described herein are
able to produce increased amounts of sugar antigens, e.g., oligo- and/or polysaccharides, as
compared to Gram-negative bacterial host cells lacking regulatory genes derived from Gram
positive bacteria. Each of these characteristics is advantageous in that the conjugates
produced by the bacterial cells have a higher sugar antigen to protein ratio and because the
bacterial cells produce a greater number of conjugates.

conjugates than a bacterial host cell having the same properties but lacking a regulatory gene
from a Gram positive bacteria that is involved in oligo- or polysaccharide biosynthesis. In
certain embodiments, a bacterial host cell described herein produces 5% to 10%, 10% to 20%,

genetics 2006, 2(3):e3 1). The DNA sequence contains putative genes encoding proteins for:
[00103[      i) transport/regulation (Wzg, Wzh, Wzd, Wze),
[00104[      ii) two glycosyltransferases most probably responsible for transfer of the two GalA

[00108[      vi) two proteins which are responsible for synthesis of nucleotide activated D
GalA, i.e. Gla and Ugd. The UDP-D-GalA synthesis by Gla and Ugd from the housekeeping
UDP-Glc was shown (Munoz R, Lopez R, de Frutos M, Garcia E: First molecular

[00109[      vii) four proteins RmlACBD known to make TDP-L-Rhamnose. These genes are
cryptic and probably dispensable for CPS production.
[00110[      Taken together, this means that all necessary genes for making a type 1 CPS are
encoded in the cluster, except:
[00111[      a) biosynthetic genes encoding proteins for synthesis of the initiator sugar UDP-D
FucNAc4N;
[00112[      b) a gene encoding a phosphorsugar transferase for adding the phospho-D
FucNAc4N to the lipid carrier Und-P. To synthesize the CPS type 1 by a modified LPS
biosynthetic pathway it is necessary to provide a) and b) in an E. coli host strain in a way that
by addition of the CPS type 1 cluster the pneumococcal LPS capsule can be synthetized. E.
coli strains generally do not encode such enzymes. Remarkably, there is only a handful of
microorganisms known that synthetize FucNAc4N and incorporate it into an polysaccharide:

 S. pneumoniae CP1 strains, Shigella sonnei, Plesiomonasshigelloides 017, and Bacterioides
fragilis.
 [00113[     Thus we reasoned that it is necessary to find a gene cluster that provides the said
 functionalites. We achieved this by using genetic elements of the biosynthetic machinery for
 the synthesis of the Shigella sonnei or Pseudomonas shigelloides 017 0 antigen. Both of
 these organisms synthetize an 0 antigen with identical structure. This 0 antigen is a genuine
 gram negative 0 antigen composed of a linear polymer composed of a disaccharide repeat
 unit -4-a-L-AltNAcA-1,3-a-D-FucNAc4N-1-, (FIG. 4) (Batta G, Liptak A, Schneerson R,

 polysaccharide of Shigella sonnei/Plesiomonasshigelloides. CarbohydrRes 1997, 305(1):93
 99). The initiating sugar was shown to be D-FucNAc4N (Kubler-Kielb J, Vinogradov E,

 procedures, and physico-chemical and immunological characterization of the conjugates.
 Vaccine 2008, 26(29-30):3587-3593). The gene cluster required for biosynthesis (FIG. 5) is
 encoded in the genome of P. shigelloides and on a virulence plasmid in S. sonnei (Kopecko
 DJ, Washington 0, Formal SB: Genetic and physical evidence for plasmid control of Shigella
 sonnei form I cell surface antigen. Infection and immunity 1980, 29(1):207-214). The gene
 functions are putatively known by homology analysis (Xu DQ, Cisar JO, Ambulos Jr N, Jr.,

 form I 0 polysaccharide: proposed biosynthetic pathway and stable expression in a live

 [00114[     Thus, the strategy to assemble the biosynthetic machinery for CPS type 1
 production in E. coli was as follows:
 [00115[     First, we aimed at reconstituting Und-PP-D-FucNAc4N production pathway. To
 achieve this, we recombinantly expressed the P. shigelloides 0 antigen cluster in E. coli.
 [00116[     Second, we deleted the L-AltNAcA glycosyltransferase from the P. shigelloides
 017 cluster, resulting in an Und-PP-D-FucNAc4N truncated lipid precursor.
 [00117[     Third, we added the CPS type 1 cluster on a plasmid. Enzymes encoded in this
 plasmid were believed to extend the Und-PP-D-FucNAc4N precursor made by the P.
 shigelloides system to complete the CPS type 1 RU and polymerize the RUs to make a
 modified LPS.
 [00118[     Technically, this was done as follows:

[00119[     In a first step, we cloned the P. shigelloides 0 antigen gene cluster
(rJbP.shigelloidesO17) into the donor plasmid pDOC-C (, Lee DJ, Bingle LE, Heurlier K,
Pallen MJ, Penn CW, Busby SJ, Hobman JL: Gene doctoring: a method for recombineering in
laboratory and pathogenic Escherichia coli strains.BMC Microbiol 2009, 9:252). By using
this donor plasmid and a helper plasmid encoding a recombinase and an endonuclease
(Kuhlman TE, Cox EC: Site-specific chromosomal integration of large synthetic constructs.
Nucleic acids research 2010, 38(6):e92), we exchanged the rfb cluster of a W31 10
AwecAwzzECA AwaaL E. coli strain by the P. shigelloides cluster (wzz to wbgZ, FIG. 5) from
the plasmid by homologous recombination. See, e.g., International Application No.
PCT/EP2013/071328, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirely. The resulting
chromosomally integrated strain makes recombinant 0 antigen which is reactive to the anti S.
sonnei typing sera in western blotting.
[00120[     The wbgW gene encoded within this integrated P. shigelloides cluster was deleted
from the chromosome by homologous recombination according to the method of Datsenko
and Wanner (Datsenko KA, Wanner BL: One-step inactivation of chromosomal genes in
Escherichia coli K-12 using PCR products. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2000, 97(12):6640
6645). The resulting strain did not produce any anti S. sonnei specific lipid linked
polysaccharide any longer, most likely due to the inability of the strain to make a complete
disaccharide repeat unit.
[00121[     Next, the CPS 1 cluster from wzg to ugd (FIG. 2) was cloned behind an artificial
promoter (J23103, http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBaJ23103) and an optimal ribosomal
binding site active in E. coli.
[00122[     Expression of the described genetic system in a shake flask culture for analysis of
lipid linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis generated a ladder like banding pattern in western
blotting using an anti CPS type 1 specific antiserum (FIG. 6). This shows that the modified
LPS biosynthesis pathway was collaborating in recombinant expression of CPS of the type 1
of S. pneumoniae.
[00123[     To further provide evidence that the produced reactive, protease resistant material
was indeed CPS type 1 linked to undecaprenyl pyrophosphate; an acid sensitivity test was
applied to the samples from FIG. 6. Mild acid treatment by TFA abrogated the anti CPS type
1 signal, indicative for the presence of the pyrophosphate bond connecting polysaccharide and
undecapenyl (FIG. 7). We found that it was possible to make a modified 0 antigen in the
presence of the transporter genes wzg-wzd. To check if these genes had a direct effect, we

(Bloor AE, Cranenburgh RM: An efficient method of selectable marker gene excision by Xer
recombination for gene replacement in bacterial chromosomes. Applied and environmental
microbiology 2006, 72(4):2520-2525). Coexpression of the modified plasmid surprisingly
leads to loss of anti CPS type 1 signal (FIG. 8). This indicates that the transporter genes are
required for efficient production of modified 0 antigen.
[00124[      To show that the recombinant CPS type 1 can be used for glycosylation of proteins
and thus the formation of protein-carbohydrate conjugates, we tested the bacterial protein
glycosylation machinery (Wacker M, Linton D, Hitchen PG, Nita-Lazar M, Haslam SM,

enzyme, which is repeatedly shown to generally N glycosylate acceptor proteins (encoding a
consensus amino acid sequence of the -D/E-x-N-x-S/T- type, in which x cannot be proline).
On the second plasmid, the carrier protein EPA was encoded, which contains two inserted N
glycosylation consensus sequences and a His-tag for Ni-affinity chromatography purification.
After the glycosylation experiment, the EPA protein was purified and probed with anti his tag
antisera (FIG. 9, panel A) and anti CPS type 1 antisera (FIG. 9, panel B) and clearly detected
in elution fractions. This proves the PglB system in conjunction with the recombinant CPS
type 1 expression system allows the efficient production of protein conjugates that can be
used as anti-pneumococcal vaccine candidates.

 [00127[    To further show that protein glycosylation can be used to produce active
conjugates vaccines, we aimed at producing a CPS type 4 conjugate in the presence of the
transporter genes as for CPS1.
 [00128[    CPS4 has a repeat unit structure containing a GalNAc at the reducing end (FIG.
 10). The complete structure is:
-1,4-(2,3 S pyr)-a-D-Gal-1,3-a-D-ManNAc-1,3-a-L-FucNAc-1,3-a-D-GalNAc
 [00129[    Unlike the gene cluster of CPS 1, the cluster encoding CPS type 4 from S.
pneumoniae encodes all necessary enzymes to synthesize a CPS4 (FIG. 11). UDP-D-FucNAc
and UDP-D-ManNAc are made by the proteins MnaA, FnlA, B, and C. The functions of
different glycosyltransferases are predicted based on their homologies to other
glycosyltransferases with known specificities. WeiI is a predicted glycosyl-phosphate
transferase and thus responsible for Und-PP-D-GalNAc synthesis, WciJ, K, and L are D
ManNAc, L-FucNAc, and D-Gal transferases, and WciM is a homolog of pyruvate
transferases (Jiang SM, Wang L, Reeves PR: Molecular characterization of Streptococcus
pneumoniae type 4, 6B, 8, and 18C capsular polysaccharide gene clusters. Infect Immun 2001,
69(3):1244-1255)
 [00130[    To reconstruct a CPS4 modified pathway in E. coli, we first cloned the CPS4 gene
cluster (the genes between aliA and dexB) into a plasmid for expression in E. coli resulting in
pGVXN803. In a second setup, we included only the genes downstream of the transporter
genes (resulting in pGVXN753), i.e. wciJ-fnlC, to explicitly analyze the effects of wzg, wzh,
wzd, and wze, as well as the effect of wcil deletion. WeiI is a phosphor-sugar transferase
homolog according to bioinformatics analysis. Similar activities are present in the E. coli,
specifically the wecA gene encoded in the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) cluster. In
pGVXN753, we included an artificial promoter sequence upstream of the multiple cloning
sites to ensure transcription of the inserted genes.
 [00131[    To analyze the effects of the above mentioned plasmids upon expression in E. coli,
we transformed W3 110 AwaaL cells with pGVXN753 and pGVXN803. W3 110 AwaaL
encodes the WecA protein that is responsible for the synthesis of Und-PP-D-GlcNAc, but is
unable to make Und-PP-D-GalNAc. The latter lipid linked monosaccharide is the expected
substrate for the enzymes of the CPS4 cluster which should complete the CPS4 RU. Thus, we
provided in addition to a CPS4 cluster plasmid two different D-GlcNAc to D-GalNAc

synthesis in vivo, the former by epimerization of the lipid linked D-GlcNAc (Und-PP-D
GlcNAc<-> Und-PP-D-GalNAc), and the latter by using the nucleotide activated sugar as
substrate (UDP-D-GlcNAc<->UDP-D-GalNAc).
[00132[      FIG. 12 shows the results of the analysis. Cells were grown and epimerase
expression was induced, and protease resistant biomass was separated by SDS-PAGE and
analyzed by immunodetection after transfer of glycolipids to nitrocellulose membrane. The
results show that whenever pGVXN803 was present in the cells, there was a ladder like signal
detected by the anti CPS4 antiserum. pGVXN753 also induced a signal, albeit much weaker
than the constructs that contained the transporter genes and wcil. Induction and nature of the
epimerase did marginally influence signal strength. The strongest reactivity was obtained
with pGVXN803 and the epimerase specific for the nucleotide activated sugar, suggesting
that WeiI is a D-GalNAc-phosphate transferase. Therefore surprisingly as for CPS1, the
transporter genes are important for efficient production of CPS4 modified LPS in E. coli. To
dissect the influence of the transporter genes versus the wcil, coexpression of wcil in presence
of pGVX753 can be employed. Most likely, wcil alone is unable to enhance CPS4 expression
to the level observed in presence of the transporter genes (i.e. in W3 110 AwaaL containing
pGVX803).

was developed to isolate, hydrolyze, modify poly- and oligosaccharides and analyze them by
HPLC and MS/MS. Cells were grown overnight and were prepared and processed according
to an established procedure (US2011/0274720).
[00134[      Briefly, glycolipids were extracted from the biomass by organic solvents
(Chloroform:Methanol:Water 10:10:3) and purified over C18 cartridges; eluates were treated

from Und-PP-glycans. The resulting solution was passed over another C18 cartridge to
remove lipids. The flow through was dried and the glycans were labeled with 2
aminobenzamide at the reducing end. The resulting labeled glycans were separated by HPLC
using a gylcosepN normal phase column and detected by fluorescence (US2011/0274720 Al).
[00135[     Resulting chromatograms are shown in FIG. 13 (panel A). Comparison of a
chromatogram obtained from SCM6 cells containing or lacking pGVXN803 shows several
peaks that are present in the former but lacking the latter. Some of these were analyzed by
MS/MS for identification of the glycan identity and sequence. For several peaks it was
possible to identify MS/MS patterns that are consistent with the expected CPS4 RU and
polymer structures (indicated by arrows). Panel B of FIG. 13 shows the MALDI-MS/MS
spectrum from the peak eluted at 53.8 minutes. Fragmentation ion series are consistent with
the CPS4 RU modified with pyruvate at the non-reducing hexose.
[00136[     We observed heterogeneity due to non-stoichiometric presence of pyruvate,
indicative for either non quantitative modification of CPS4 repeat units with pyruvate or
hydrolysis during sample preparation. We concluded from the data that we were able to
generate a modified LPS biosynthetic pathway producing CPS4 glycans on Und-PP.
[00137[     To further analyze the CSP4 glycolipids, we extracted glycolipids from E. coli

CSP4 and analyzed them as described above (FIG. 14) or directly used glycoplipids for in
vitro glycosylation. In this experiment, glycolipids, an acceptor peptide containing the N
glycosylation consensus sequence, and purified preparation of the oligosaccharyltransferase
PglB are mixed (Jervis AJ, Butler JA, Lawson AJ, Langdon R, Wren BW, Linton D:

which can be analyzed by a HILIC chromatography followed (FIG. 15, panels A and B) by
ESI-MS/MS for sequencing of the glycan. When the products from such an experiment were
analyzed, exclusively pyruvylated glycans attached to peptides were identified (FIG. 15,
panels C and D). Thus, the non-stoichiometric pyruvylation observed in FIG. 13 and 14 most
likely originated from hydrolysis of pyruvate from the glycan during sample preparation
rather than non-quantitative decoration of the CPS4 RU. Thus, we claim that by the modified

the synthesis of an active and possibly better conjugate compared to chemical conjugation.
[00138[       To test this hypothesis, we aimed at testing glycoconjugate in preclinical assays.
In a first step, we used microbial fermentation to produce CPS4 conjugated to a generic
carrier protein, genetically detoxified Exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa(EPA,

medium and induced at suitable ODs and production was performed overnight. His tagged
EPA was purified from periplasmic extracts prepared by the periplasmic extraction using
lysozyme followed by IMAC. Analytical assays of elution fractions are shown in FIG. 16.
SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining show non- and glycosylated EPA at 70 and above 70
kDa, the latter being present in a ladder like pattern indicative for a (modified) 0 antigen
glycan composed of RUs (FIG. 16, panel A). Immunodetection by anti His (FIG. 16, panel B)
and anti CPS4 (FIG. 16, panel C) after electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes of the
same fractions confirmed the presence of CPS4 and EPA in the material.
[00139[       Glycoconjugates were further purified by anion exchange chromatography for
separation of non- and glycosylated EPA; glycoprotein was then further purified by size
exclusion chromatography. The resulting glycoprotein preparation was analyzed for
monosaccharide composition using derivatization by 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP,

that the glycan composition of recombinant glycoconjugate is identical to CPS4 isolated from
S. pneumoniae (FIG. 17).
[00140[       To test the vaccine activity of the glycoconjugates, immunization studies and

control, we used Prevenar 13, a licensed and marketed product widely used for the prevention
of pediatric pneumococcal disease. The resulting antisera were submitted to analysis by dot
blot for immunogenicity (FIG. 18) and OPA for functionality according to a standardized
protocol (Romero-Steiner S, Frasch CE, Carlone G, Fleck RA, Goldblatt D, Nahm MH: Use
of opsonophagocytosis for serological evaluation of pneumococcal vaccines. Clin Vaccine

 [00141[    Table 1 shows the relevant opsonic titers obtained. The results show that
glycoconjugates recombinantly made in E. coli are equally well and in some instances even
superior to the licensed vaccine comparator in terms of the ability to raise antisera active in
the opsonophagocytotic assay.
 [00142[    Example 3: Synthesis of CPS14 conjugates in E. coli:
 [00143[    To further show that E. coli can be used for the production of CPS conjugates, we
aimed at producing CPS14 conjugates. The CPS14 polysaccharide is encoded by CPS14
cluster (FIG. 19) in a similar architecture as CPS1 and CPS4. CPS14 consists of polymerized
RUs with the following structure (FIG. 20): -1,6-(b-D-Gal-1,4)-b-D-GlcNAc-1,3-b-D-Gal
 1,4-b-D-Glc-.
 [00144[    The biosynthesis of CPS 14 starts with the addition of phospho-D-Glc to
undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P) by the activity of WchA. WchA was biochemically shown
to be a phospho-glycose transferase, with identical activity as the E. coli WcaJ protein
encoded by a gene in the colanic acid cluster. Further elongation of the D-Glc is achieved by
the enzymatic actions of the other glycosyltransferases present in the cluster (Kolkman MA,

capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis locus of Streptococcuspneumoniae serotype 14. JBiol

WchJK (D-Gal transferase), WchL (D-GlcNAc transferase), WchM (D-Gal transferase), Wzy
(polymerase), Wzx (flippase). WciY is dispensable for CPS14 formation, whereas wchN
deletion negatively influences CPS14 yields (Kolkman MA, Wakarchuk W, Nuijten PJ, van

functions encoded than minimally required for CPS14 biosynthesis. Most probably, some of
the proteins with unassigned functions are auxiliary enzymes supporting biosynthesis of the
capsule.
[00145[      To test production of CPS14 polysaccharide in E. coli the CPS14 gene cluster
consisting of the stretch from wchA to wciY was cloned into the pDOC donor plasmid (Lee

(pGVXN615) and transformed into E. coli strain GVXN 1128 (W3 110 AwaaL). Immunoblot
analysis of the proteinase K digested E. coli cells harboring pGVXN615 showed a ladder-like
pattern, which was detected with CPS14 antiserum that is used for capsular serotyping of
clinical CPS14 isolates (Inset of FIG. 21, panel A). Furthermore, to accumulate a single
repeating unit, the polymerase of CPS14 cluster, wzy, was deleted in pGVXN615 by
transposon mutagenesis, resulting in pGVXN643. The glycolipids were extracted from E.
coli cells transformed with pGVXN643 and analyzed by NP-HPLC after hydrolysis and
fluorescent labeling as described above. A specific peak eluted at 57.4 minute (FIG. 21, panel
A) from the glycosepN column. MS and MS/MS analysis of this peak matched with expected
mass and fragmentation pattern of a single repeating unit of CPS 14 (FIG. 21, panel B). This
confirms that expression of a partial CPS 14 gene cluster under the control of an 0 antigen
promoter can lead to a recombinant LPS biosynthetic CPS14 oligosaccharide production in a
common E. coli host cell.
[00146[      In order to improve and stabilize biosynthesis of CPS14 polysaccharide in E. coli,

showed a ladder-like pattern detected by CPS14 antiserum which was used for serotyping of
clinical CPS14 isolates; this pattern was not detectable in the absence of RcsA (see FIG. 22).
This result demonstrates that colanic acid is a sutitable target location to integrate
polysaccharide biosynthetic pathways and that the expression of heterologous polysaccharide
is tightly controlled by the E. coli RcsA protein.
[00147[      To further characterize the CPS14 produced in E. coli, GVX6129 (W3 1 OAwaaL
CA::CPS14) was transformed into E. coli along with pGVXN688 (rcsA). Glycolipids were
analyzed by 2-AB labeling and MS/MS analysis as described above. MS/MS analysis
identified 2 and 3 subunits of CPS 14, eluted at 95.9 min and 115.3, respectively (see FIG 24).
[00148[      To test the effect of expression of transporter genes on the production of CPS14
polysaccharide in E. coli, wzg to wze of the S. pneumoniae CPS14 cluster, containing the
transporter genes was cloned into a low copy number plasmid with IPTG inducible promoter
(pGVX 72) to form pGVX1497. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain GVX6126
(E. coli W3 110 CA::CPS14), from which the wchA to wciYportion of the CPS14 cluster had
been integrated into colanic acid E. coli. GVX6126 was transformed with pGVX72 or
pGVX 1497 and cultured, with induction of transporter gene expression using 0.01 mM IPTG.
E. coli cells were harvested after over night incubation and digested with proteinase K, and a
protease resistant biomass was separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunodetection
after transfer of glycolipids to nitrocellulose membrane. The results show that in the presence
of pGVXN1497 (expressing wzg-wzh-wzd-wze), a high molecular weight ladder like signal
was detected by the anti CPS14 antiserum (see FIG 23. Lane 3), and when pGVXN1497 was
replaced with an empty vector (pGVX72), the ladder size was significantly reduced (see FIG
23. Lane 2). This demonstrates a supporting requirement of transporter genes for the
production of CPS.
[00149[      The gtrABS operon is involved in the synthesis of glucose on Und-P, a cellular
compound which is very similar to the native initiator step for CPS14 (synthetized by wchA),
Und-PP. The gtrABS operon contains genes that encode enzymes involved in assembly of
glucose on the Und-P in the cytoplasm, flipping of the glycolipid into the periplasm, and a
glucosyltransferase which uses Und-P-glucose as a donor to transfer the glucose residue onto
the reducing end GlcNAc of 016 subunit in the E. coli W3 110.

initiator glucose can be used. In addition, the Und-P-glucose production pathway can be
deleted. In this way, all CPS is linked to Und by a pyrophosphate linkage and thus available
for glycosylation.
[00151[      To further elucidate and optimize the biosynthetic pathway of CPS14 in E. coli,
the initiator glucosyltransferase activity of the CPS14 pathway can be enhanced. This
explored by deletion of wchA and wcaJ, and complementing them by plasmid borne
overexpression strategies using the same genes and analysing the effects on glycolipid
production.
[00152[      A plasmid containing the wcaJ gene may well be transformed into E. coli strains
containing CPS14 but lacking WchA and WcaJ (e.g. W3110 AwaaL ArJbOl6::CPS14-clmR
AwchA AgtrABS). Using established methods, the sugar production can be analysed in these
strains. Based on these results, the optimum combination of genes for production of
maximum amount of CPS 14 linked to Und-PP could be determined and used to transform E.
coli generating the optimal production strain. Certainly, this novel E. coli strain with superior
sugar production could be ideal to enrich the production of glycosylated proteins, both N and
o glycosylated. Moreover, this newly engineered strain could be used to generate different
glycoconjugates, if additionally; diverse protein carriers are included in the production strain
of any glycoconjugate containing Glc at the reducing end.
