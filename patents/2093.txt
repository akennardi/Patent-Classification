                                     RELATED APPLICATIONS
10000] This is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, which is a divisional
of Australian Patent Application No. 2010315084, which is the Australian National Phase of
PCT/US2010/055604, which claims priority from United States patent application USSN 61/280674,
filed 6 November 2009. The contents of each application listed in this paragraph are fully
incorporated by reference herein.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
10001] Organ transplantation is an important medical procedure which saves lives in cases where a
patient has organ failure or disablement, and it is now possible to transplant many organs including
heart, lungs, kidney, and liver. In some cases, the transplanted organ is rejected by the recipient
patient, which creates a life-threatening situation. Monitoring the patient for rejection is difficult and
expensive, often requiring invasive procedures. Furthermore, current surveillance methods lack
adequate sensitivity.
10002] The present invention resolves these problems by providing non-invasive methods of
monitoring organ transplant patients for rejection that are sensitive, rapid and inexpensive.
                                  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
10003] The invention provides methods, devices, compositions and kits for diagnosing and/or
predicting transplant status or outcome in a subject who has received a transplant. In some
embodiments, the invention provides methods of diagnosing or predicting transplant status or
outcome comprising the steps of: (i) providing a sample from a subject who has received a transplant
from a donor; (ii) determining the presence or absence of one or more nucleic acids from the donor
transplant, where the one or more nucleic acids from the donor are identified based on a
predetermined marker profile; and (iii) diagnosing or predicting transplant status or outcome based
on the presence or absence of the one or more nucleic acids.
10004] In some embodiments, the transplant status or outcome comprises rejection, tolerance, non
rejection based allograft injury, transplant function, transplant survival, chronic transplant s injury, or
titer pharmacological immunosuppression. In some embodiments, the non-rejection based allograft
injury is selected from the group of ischemic injury, virus infection, peri-operative ischemia,
reperfusion injury, hypertension, physiological stress, injuries due to reactive oxygen species and
injuries caused by pharmaceutical agents.

10005] In some embodiments, the sample is selected from the group consisting of blood, serum,
urine, and stool. In some embodiments, the marker profile is a polymorphic marker profile. In some
embodiments, the polymorphic marker profile comprises one or more single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP's), one or more restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP's), one or
more short tandem repeats (STRs), one or more variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR's), one or
more hypervariable regions, one or more minisatellites, one or more dinucleotide repeats, one or

10006] In some embodiments, the marker profile is determined by genotyping the transplant donor.
In some embodiments, the methods further comprise genotyping the subject receiving the transplant.
In some embodiments, the methods further comprise establishing a profile of markers, where the
markers are distinguishable between the transplant donor and the subject receiving the transplant. In
some embodiments, the genotyping is performed by a method selected from the group consisting of
sequencing, nucleic acid array and PCR.
10007] In any of the embodiments described herein, the transplant graft maybe any solid organ and
skin transplant. In some embodiments, the transplant is selected from the group consisting of kidney
transplant, heart transplant, liver transplant, pancreas transplant, lung transplant, intestine transplant
and skin transplant.

stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA hairpins, DNA/RNA hybrids, RNA and
RNA hairpins. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid is selected from the group consisting of
double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA and cDNA. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid is
mRNA. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid is obtained from circulating donor cells. In some
embodiments, the nucleic acid is circulating cell-free DNA.
10009] In some embodiments, the presence or absence of the one or more nucleic acids is
determined by a method selected from the group consisting of sequencing, nucleic acid array and
PCR. In some embodiments, the sequencing is shotgun sequencing. In some embodiments, the array
is a DNA array. In some embodiments, the DNA array is a polymorphism array. In some
embodiments, the polymorphism array is a SNP array.
10010] In some embodiments, the methods further comprise quantitating the one or more nucleic
acids. In some embodiments, the amount of the one or more nucleic acids is indicative of transplant
status or outcome. In some embodiments, the amount of the one or more nucleic acids above a
predetermined threshold value is indicative of a transplant status or outcome. In some embodiments,
the threshold is a normative value for clinically stable post-transplantation patients with no evidence
of transplant rejection or other pathologies. In some embodiments, there are different predetermined
threshold values for different transplant outcomes or status. In some embodiments, temporal
differences in the amount of the one or more nucleic acids are indicative of a transplant status or
outcome.

                        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
10022] Reference will now be made in detail to particularly preferred embodiments of the invention.
Examples of the preferred embodiments are illustrated in the following Examples section.
                                                    -3-

10023] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same
meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All
patents and publications referred to herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.
10024] Methods, devices, compositions and kits are provided for diagnosing or predicting transplant
status or outcome in a subject who has received a transplant. The transplant status or outcome may
comprise rejection, tolerance, non-rejection based transplant injury, transplant function, transplant
survival, chronic transplant injury, or titer pharmacological immunosuppression.
10025] This invention describes sensitive and non-invasive methods, devices, compositions and kits
for monitoring organ transplant patients, and/or for diagnosing or predicting transplant status or
outcome (e.g. transplant rejection). In some embodiments, the methods, devices, compositions and
kits are used to establish a genotype for both the donor and the recipient before transplantation to
enable the detection of donor-specific nucleic acids such as DNA or RNA in bodily fluids such as
blood or urine from the organ recipient after transplantation.
10026] In some embodiments, the invention provides methods of determining whether a patient or
subject is displaying transplant tolerance. The term "transplant tolerance" includes when the subject
does not reject a graft organ, tissue or cell(s) that has been introduced into/onto the subject. In other
words, the subject tolerates or maintains the organ, tissue or cell(s) that has been transplanted to it.
The term "patient" or "subject" as used herein includes humans as well as other mammals.
10027] In some embodiments the invention provides methods for diagnosis or prediction of
transplant rejection. The term "transplant rejection" encompasses both acute and chronic transplant
rejection. "Acute rejection or AR" is the rejection by the immune system of a tissue transplant
recipient when the transplanted tissue is immunologically foreign. Acute rejection is characterized by
infiltration of the transplanted tissue by immune cells of the recipient, which carry out their effector
function and destroy the transplanted tissue. The onset of acute rejection is rapid and generally occurs
in humans within a few weeks after transplant surgery. Generally, acute rejection can be inhibited or
suppressed with immunosuppressive drugs such as rapamycin, cyclosporin A, anti-CD40L
monoclonal antibody and the like.
10028] "Chronic transplant rejection or CR" generally occurs in humans within several months to
years after engraftment, even in the presence of successful immunosuppression of acute rejection.
Fibrosis is a common factor in chronic rejection of all types of organ transplants. Chronic rejection
can typically be described by a range of specific disorders that are characteristic of the particular
organ. For example, in lung transplants, such disorders include fibroproliferative destruction of the
airway (bronchiolitis obliterans); in heart transplants or transplants of cardiac tissue, such as valve
replacements, such disorders include fibrotic atherosclerosis; in kidney transplants, such disorders
include, obstructive nephropathy, nephrosclerorsis, tubulointerstitial nephropathy; and in liver
transplants, such disorders include disappearing bile duct syndrome. Chronic rejection can also be
                                                      -4-

characterized by ischemic insult, denervation of the transplanted tissue, hyperlipidemia and
hypertension associated with immunosuppressive drugs.
10029] In some embodiments, the invention further includes methods for determining an
immunosuppressive regimen for a subject who has received a transplant, e.g., an allograft.
10030] Certain embodiments of the invention provide methods of predicting transplant survival in a
subject that has received a transplant. The invention provides methods of diagnosing or predicting
whether a transplant in a transplant patient or subject will survive or be lost. In certain embodiments,
the invention provides methods of diagnosing or predicting the presence of long-term graft survival.
By "long-term" graft survival is meant graft survival for at least about 5 years beyond current
sampling, despite the occurrence of one or more prior episodes of acute rejection. In certain
embodiments, transplant survival is determined for patients in which at least one episode of acute
rejection has occurred. As such, these embodiments provide methods of determining or predicting
transplant survival following acute rejection. Transplant survival is determined or predicted in
certain embodiments in the context of transplant therapy, e.g., immunosuppressive therapy, where
immunosuppressive therapies are known in the art. In yet other embodiments, methods of
determining the class and/or severity of acute rejection (and not just the presence thereof) are
provided.
10031] In some embodiments, the invention provides methods for diagnosis or prediction of non
rejection based transplant injury. Examples of non-rejection based graft injury include, but are not
limited to, ischemic injury, virus infection, peri-operative ischemia, reperfusion injury, hypertension,
physiological stress, injuries due to reactive oxygen species and injuries caused by pharmaceutical
agents.
10032] As in known in the transplantation field, the transplant organ, tissue or cell(s) may be
allogeneic or xenogeneic, such that the grafts may be allografts or xenografts. A feature of the graft
tolerant phenotype detected or identified by the subject methods is that it is a phenotype which occurs
without immunosuppressive therapy, i.e., it is present in a host that is not undergoing
immunosuppressive therapy such that immunosuppressive agents are not being administered to the
host. The transplant graft maybe any solid organ and skin transplant. Examples of organ transplants
that can be analyzed by the methods described herein include but are not limited to kidney transplant,
pancreas transplant, liver transplant, heart transplant, lung transplant, intestine transplant, pancreas
after kidney transplant, and simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant.
10033] Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to the tenth
of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, between the upper and
lower limit of that range and any other stated or intervening value in that stated range, is
encompassed within the invention. The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may
independently be included in the smaller ranges and are also encompassed within the invention,
subject to any specifically excluded limit in the stated range. Where the stated range includes one or
                                                     -5-

both of the limits, ranges excluding either or both of those included limits are also included in the
invention.
10034] Certain ranges are presented herein with numerical values being preceded by the term
"about." The term "about" is used herein to provide literal support for the exact number that it
precedes, as well as a number that is near to or approximately the number that the term precedes. In
determining whether a number is near to or approximately a specifically recited number, the near or
approximating unrecited number may be a number which, in the context in which it is presented,
provides the substantial equivalent of the specifically recited number.
10035] The practice of the present invention employs, unless otherwise indicated, conventional
techniques of immunology, biochemistry, chemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, cell biology,
genomics and recombinant DNA, which are within the skill of the art. See Sambrook, Fritsch and

Introduction
10036] Methods, devices, compositions and kits are provided for diagnosing or predicting transplant
status or outcome in a subject who has received a transplant.
10037] As mention above, monitoring transplant patients for transplant status or outcome is difficult
and expensive, often requiring non-sensitive and invasive procedures. For instance, in heart
transplant patients acute rejection surveillance requires serial endomyocardial biopsies that are
routinely performed at weekly and monthly intervals during the initial year after transplant, with a
total of 6-8 biopsies in most patients. Advances in immunosuppression, rejection surveillance, and
early recognition and treatment of life-threatening infections have led to continuous improvements in
early outcomes after cardiac transplantation. (Taylor, D.O., et al., J Heart Lung Transplant,27, 943
956 (2008)) However, there has not been a similar improvement in late mortality, which is largely
attributable to cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). (Figure 1) Today, CAV remains the major
cause of late graft failure and death amongst the nearly 22,000 living heart transplant recipients in the
United States. Early detection of CAV, prior to the development of angiographically apparent
disease, graft dysfunction, or symptom onset is important because patient mortality after detection by
coronary angiography (the standard of care) is unacceptably high, with 2-year mortality rates of 50%
having been reported. Current surveillance methods for CAV lack adequate sensitivity or require
invasive procedures and the most commonly applied method, coronary angiography, lacks sensitivity
(Kobashigawa, J.A., et al., J Am Coll Cardiol, 45, 1532-1537 (2005)). Delayed diagnosis due to
underestimation of disease severity is a feature of coronary angiography that is largely overcome by
                                                    -6-

intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). (Fitzgerald, P.J., et al., Circulation,86, 154-158 (1992)) However,
both of these invasive left-heart, arterial catheter methods are costly, resource intensive, and
associated with significant risk of morbidity and patient discomfort. Early detection of CAV, prior to
the development of angiographically apparent disease, graft dysfunction, or symptom onset is crucial
to guide the appropriate use of emerging therapies that retard and occasionally reverse progression of
CAV. The development of markers for early, non-invasive, safe, and cost-effective detection of acute
rejection and CAV, and their rapid translation to a practical and reliable test that can be used in the
clinic represents a major unmet medical need for the nearly 22,000 living heart transplant recipients
in the United States, and a similar number worldwide.
10038] The pressing need for early diagnosis and risk stratification is further underscored by recent
studies demonstrating delayed progression and/or reversal of CAV following intervention with newer
immunosuppressive regimens. Since the use of these newer therapies are encumbered by adverse
effects, drug interactions, and cost, it is important to identity the patients in whom the benefits
outweigh the risks. Aside from its impact on mortality and morbidity, CAV surveillance is costly in
terms of resource utilization and potential for patient complications. Given the current standard of
care to perform annual coronary angiography for the initial five years after heart transplantation, each
patient surviving to year 5 will have received 4 angiograms for an average fully loaded cost of
$25,000 per angiogram. Since the 5-year survival rate after heart transplantation is 72%,
approximately 1,440 patients out of the 2,000 patients receiving heart transplants each year will
undergo 4 procedures for a total of at least 5,760 procedures. At an average cost of $25,000 per
coronary angiogram, this will amount to $144,000,000 per year in healthcare dollars for monitoring
patients after heart transplantation. A non-invasive test that identifies the patients at low risk of CAV
would mean that coronary angiography could be safely avoided in this group, thereby considerably
reducing the cost of their long-term management.
10039] The same difficulties and expenses are experienced by patients receiving other type of
transplants.
         a. Circulating Nucleic Acids
10040] Circulating, or cell-free, DNA was first detected in human blood plasma in 1948. (Mandel, P.
Metais, P., C R Acad. Sci. Paris, 142, 241-243 (1948)) Since then, its connection to disease has been
established in several areas. (Tong, Y.K. Lo, Y.M., Clin Chim Acta, 363, 187-196 (2006)) Studies
reveal that much of the circulating nucleic acids in blood arise from necrotic or apoptotic cells
(Giacona, M.B., et al., Pancreas, 17, 89-97 (1998)) and greatly elevated levels of nucleic acids from
apoptosis is observed in diseases such as cancer. (Giacona, M.B., et al., Pancreas, 17, 89-97 (1998);
Fournie, G.J., et al., Cancer Lett, 91, 221-227 (1995))     Particularly for cancer, where the circulating
DNA bears hallmark signs of the disease including mutations in oncogenes, microsatellite alterations,
and, for certain cancers, viral genomic sequences, DNA or RNA in plasma has become increasingly
studied as a potential biomarker for disease. For example, Diehl et al recently demonstrated that a
                                                     -7-

quantitative assay for low levels of circulating tumor DNA in total circulating DNA could serve as a
better marker for detecting the relapse of colorectal cancer compared with carcinoembryonic antigen,
the standard biomarker used clinically. (Diehl, F., et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci, 102, 16368-16373
(2005); Diehl, F., et al., Nat Med, 14, 985-990 (2008)) Maheswaran et al reported the use of
genotyping of circulating cells in plasma to detect activating mutations in epidermal growth factor
receptors in lung cancer patients that would affect drug treatment. (Maheswaran, S., et al., N Engl J
Med, 359, 366-377 (2008)) These results collectively establish both circulating DNA, either free in
plasma or from circulating cells, as a useful species in cancer detection and treatment. Circulating
DNA has also been useful in healthy patients for fetal diagnostics, with fetal DNA circulating in
maternal blood serving as a marker for gender, rhesus D status, fetal aneuploidy, and sex-linked
disorders. Fan et al recently demonstrated a strategy for detecting fetal aneuploidy by shotgun
sequencing of cell-free DNA taken from a maternal blood sample, a methodology that can replace
more invasive and risky techniques such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. (Fan, H.C.,
Blumenfeld, Y.J., Chitkara, U., Hudgins, L., Quake, S.R., Proc Natl Acad Sci, 105, 16266-16271
(2008))
10041] In all these applications of circulating nucleic acids, the presence of sequences differing from
a patient's normal genotype has been used to detect disease. In cancer, mutations of genes are a tell
tale sign of the advance of the disease; in fetal diagnostics, the detection of sequences specific to the
fetus compared to maternal DNA allows for analysis of the health of the fetus.
10042] In some embodiments, the invention provides non-invasive diagnostics exists for organ
transplant patients where sequences from the organ donor, otherwise "foreign" to the patient, can be
quantitated specifically. Without intending to be limited to any theory, as cell-free DNA or RNA
often arises from apoptotic cells, the relative amount of donor-specific sequences in circulating
nucleic acids should provide a predictive measure of on-coming organ failure in transplant patients
for many types of solid organ transplantation including, but not limited to, heart, lung, liver, and
kidney.
         b. Circulating Nucleic Acids and Transplant Rejection
10043] In some embodiments, the invention provides methods, devices, compositions and kits for
detection and/or quantitating circulating nucleic acids, either free in plasma or from circulating cells,
for the diagnosis, prognosis, detection and/or treatment of a transplant status or outcome. There have
been claims of detection of donor-DNA in sex-mismatched liver and kidney transplant patients;
conventional PCR was used to search for Y chromosome sequences from male donors in the blood of
female patients. (Lo, Y.M., et al., Lancet, 351, 1329-1330 (1998) However, in a follow-on study Y
chromosome specific sequences were not detected above background in 16 out of 18 patients using a
more accurate quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. (Lui, Y.Y., et al., Clin Chem,
49, 495-496 (2003)) In renal transplantation, urine samples of similarly sex-mismatched transplant
patients were analyzed and Y chromosomal DNA was detected in patients immediately after
                                                     -8-

transplantation as well as during graft rejection episodes. (Zhang, J., et al., Clin Chem, 45, 1741-1746
(1999) ; Zhong, X.Y., et al., Ann N Y Acad Sci, 945, 250-257 (2001))
10044] Example 1 examined gender-mismatched heart transplant recipients and applied digital PCR
(Warren, L., Bryder, D., Weissman, I.L., Quake, S.R., Proc Natl Acad Sci, 103, 17807-17812 (2006);
Fan, H.C. Quake, S.R., Anal Chem, 79, 7576-7579 (2007)) to detect the level of donor-derived
chromosome Y signal in plasma samples taken at the same time that an endomyocardial biopsy
determined a grade 3A or 3B rejection episode. While there was not any significant chromosome Y
signal detected from four control female-to-female transplant patients, 1.5-8% total genomic fraction
for chromosome Y signals at the rejection time points was observed for three male-to-female
transplant patients across four rejection episodes (Figure 2). A time-course study for one of these
patients revealed that the level of chromosome Y detected in plasma was neglible in plasma at three
months prior to rejection, but increased >10-fold to 2% of total genomic fraction at the time a biopsy
determined rejection (See Figures 3 and 4). Collectively, these results establish that for heart
transplant patients, donor-derived DNA present in plasma can serve as a potential marker for the
onset of organ failure.
10045] While each of these studies demonstrates donor-DNA in bodily fluids for different solid
organ transplants, they are all limited to the special case of females receiving organs from males and
will not work for females receiving from females, males receiving from males, or males receiving
from females. Further problems with this strategy arise from the prevalence of microchimerism in
female patients where past male pregnancies or blood transfusions may lead to Y-chromosome
specific signals from sources other than the transplanted organ. (Hubacek, J.A., Vymetalova, Y.,
Bohuslavova, R., Kocik, M., Malek, I., Transplant Proc, 39, 1593-1595 (2007); Vymetalova, Y., et
al., Transplant Proc, 40, 3685-3687 (2008)) The detection of donor-specific human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) alleles in circulating DNA has been considered as a signal for organ rejection,
specifically for kidney and pancreas transplant patients. (Gadi, V.K., Nelson, J.L., Boespflug, N.D.,
Guthrie, K.A., Kuhr, C.S., Clin Chem, 52, 379-382 (2006)) However, this strategy will also be
limited by the inability to distinguish HLA alleles between all donors and recipients, particularly for
common HLA types, and the potential complication of microchimerism such as from blood
transfusions. (Baxter-Lowe, L.A. Busch, M.P., Clin Chem, 52, 559-561 (2006))
10046] In some embodiments, the invention provides a universal approach to noninvasive detection
of graft rejection in transplant patients which circumvents the potential problems of microchimerism
from DNA from other foreign sources and is general for all organ recipients without consideration of
gender. In some embodiments, a genetic fingerprint is generated for the donor organ. This approach
allows for a reliable identification of sequences arising solely from the organ transplantation that can
be made in a manner that is independent of the genders of donor and recipient.
10047] In some embodiments, both the donor and recipient will be genotyped prior to
transplantation. Examples of methods that can be used to genotyped the transplant donor and the
                                                     -9-

transplant recipient include, but are not limited to, whole genome sequencing, exome sequencing, or
polymorphisms arrays (e.g., SNP arrays). A set of relevant and distinguishable markers between the
two sources is established. In some embodiments, the set of markers comprises a set of polymorphic
markers. Polymorphic markers include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's), restriction
fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP's), short tandem repeats (STRs), variable number of tandem
repeats (VNTR's), hypervariable regions, minisatellites, dinucleotide repeats, trinucleotide repeats,
tetranucleotide repeats, simple sequence repeats, and insertion elements such as Alu. In some
embodiments, the set of markers comprises SNPs.
10048] Following transplantation, bodily fluid such as blood can be drawn from the patient and
analyzed for markers. Examples of bodily fluids include, but are not limited to, smears, sputum,
biopsies, secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, bile, blood, lymph fluid, saliva, and urine. Detection,
identification and/or quantitation of the donor-specific markers (e.g. polymorphic markers such as
SNPs) can be performed using real-time PCR, chips (e.g., SNP chips), high-throughput shotgun
sequencing of circulating nucleic acids (e.g. cell-free DNA), as well as other methods known in the
art including the methods described herein. The proportion of donor nucleic acids can be monitored
over time and an increase in this proportion can be used to determine transplant status or outcome
(e.g. transplant rejection).
10049] In some embodiments, where the transplant is a xenotransplant, detection, identification
and/or quantitation of the donor-specific markers can be performed by mapping one or more nucleic
acids (e.g., DNA) to the genome of the specie use to determine whether the one or more nucleic acids
come from the transplant donor. Polymorphic markers as described above can also be used where
the transplant is a xenotransplant.
10050] In any of the embodiments described herein, the transplant graft can be any solid organ or
skin transplant. Examples of organ transplants that can be analyzed by the methods described herein
include but are not limited to kidney transplant, pancreas transplant, liver transplant, heart transplant,
lung transplant, intestine transplant, pancreas after kidney transplant, and simultaneous pancreas
kidney transplant.
Samples
10051] In some embodiments, the methods described herein involve performing one or more genetic
analyses or detection steps on nucleic acids. In some embodiments target nucleic acids are from a
sample obtained from a subject that has received a transplant. Such subject can be a human or a
domesticated animal such as a cow, chicken, pig, horse, rabbit, dog, cat, or goat. In some
embodiments, the cells used in the present invention are taken from a patient. Samples derived from
an animal, e.g., human, can include, for example whole blood, sweat, tears, saliva, ear flow, sputum,
lymph, bone marrow suspension, lymph, urine, saliva, semen, vaginal flow, cerebrospinal fluid, brain
fluid, ascites, milk, secretions of the respiratory, intestinal or genitourinary tracts fluid, a lavage of a
tissue or organ (e.g. lung) or tissue which has been removed from organs, such as breast, lung,
                                                     -10-

intestine, skin, cervix, prostate, pancreas, heart, liver and stomach. For example, a tissue sample can
comprise a region of functionally related cells or adjacent cells. Such samples can comprise complex
populations of cells, which can be assayed as a population, or separated into sub-populations. Such
cellular and acellular samples can be separated by centrifugation, elutriation, density gradient
separation, apheresis, affinity selection, panning, FACS, centrifugation with Hypaque, etc. By using
antibodies specific for markers identified with particular cell types, a relatively homogeneous
population of cells may be obtained. Alternatively, a heterogeneous cell population can be used.
Cells can also be separated by using filters. For example, whole blood can also be applied to filters
that are engineered to contain pore sizes that select for the desired cell type or class. Cells can be
filtered out of diluted, whole blood following the lysis of red blood cells by using filters with pore
sizes between 5 to 10 jtm, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application No. 09/790,673. Other devices can
separate cells from the bloodstream, see Demirci U, Toner M., Direct etch method for microfluidic
channel and nanoheight post-fabrication by picoliter droplets, Applied Physics Letters 2006; 88 (5),
053117; and Irimia D, Geba D, Toner M., Universal microfluidic gradient generator, Analytical
Chemistry 2006; 78: 3472-3477. Once a sample is obtained, it can be used directly, frozen, or
maintained in appropriate culture medium for short periods of time. Methods to isolate one or more
cells for use according to the methods of this invention are performed according to standard
techniques and protocols well-established in the art.
10052] To obtain a blood sample, any technique known in the art may be used, e.g. a syringe or
other vacuum suction device. A blood sample can be optionally pre-treated or processed prior to
enrichment. Examples of pre-treatment steps include the addition of a reagent such as a stabilizer, a
preservative, a fixant, a lysing reagent, a diluent, an anti-apoptotic reagent, an anti-coagulation
reagent, an anti-thrombotic reagent, magnetic property regulating reagent, a buffering reagent, an
osmolality regulating reagent, a pH regulating reagent, and/or a cross-linking reagent.
10053] When a blood sample is obtained, a preservative such an anti-coagulation agent and/or a
stabilizer can be added to the sample prior to enrichment. This allows for extended time for
analysis/detection. Thus, a sample, such as a blood sample, can be analyzed under any of the
methods and systems herein within 1 week, 6 days, 5 days, 4 days, 3 days, 2 days, 1 day, 12 hrs, 6
hrs, 3 hrs, 2 hrs, or 1 hr from the time the sample is obtained.
10054] In some embodiments, a blood sample can be combined with an agent that selectively lyses
one or more cells or components in a blood sample. For example platelets and/or enucleated red
blood cells are selectively lysed to generate a sample enriched in nucleated cells. The cells of interest
can subsequently be separated from the sample using methods known in the art.
10055] When obtaining a sample from a subject (e.g., blood sample), the amount can vary depending
upon subject size and the condition being screened. In some embodiments, up to 50, 40, 30, 20, 10,
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 mL of a sample is obtained. In some embodiments, 1-50, 2-40, 3-30, or 4-20
                                                      -11-

mL of sample is obtained. In some embodiments, more than 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55,
60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 or 100 mL of a sample is obtained.
Nucleic Acids
10056] Nucleic acids from samples that can be analyzed by the methods herein include: double
stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA hairpins, DNA/RNA hybrids, RNA (e.g.
mRNA or miRNA) and RNA hairpins. Examples of genetic analyses that can be performed on
nucleic acids include e.g., sequencing, SNP detection, STR detection, RNA expression analysis, and
gene expression.

30 ug, 40 ug, 50 ug, 100 ug, 200 ug, 500 ug or 1 mg of nucleic acids are obtained from the sample
for further genetic analysis. In some cases, about 1-5 pg, 5-10 pg, 10- 100 pg, 100 pg- 1 ng, 1 -5 ng,
5 - 10 ng, 10 - 100 ng, 100 ng- lug of nucleic acids are obtained from the sample for further genetic
analysis.
10058] In some embodiments, the methods described herein are used to detect and/or quantified a
target nucleic acid molecule. In some embodiments, the methods described herein are used to detect
and/or quantified multiple target nucleic acid molecules. The methods described herein can analyzed
at least 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 10, 20; 50; 100; 200; 500; 1,000; 2,000; 5,000; 10,000, 20,000; 50,000; 100,000;
200,000; 300,000; 400,000; 500,000; 600,000; 700,000; 800,000; 900,000; 1,000,000; 2,000,000 or
3,000,000 different target nucleic acids.
10059] In some embodiments, the methods described herein are used to distinguish between target
nucleic acids that differ from another nucleic acid by 1 nt. In some embodiments, the methods
described herein are used to distinguish between target nucleic acids that differ from another nucleic
acid by 1 nt or more than 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 30 nt.
10060] In some embodiments, the methods described herein are used to detect and/or quantify
genomic DNA regions. In some embodiments, the methods described herein can discriminate and
quantitate genomic DNA regions. The methods described herein can discriminate and quantitate at
least 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 10, 20; 50; 100; 200; 500; 1,000; 2,000; 5,000; 10,000, 20,000; 50,000; 100,000;
200,000; 300,000; 400,000; 500,000; 600,000; 700,000; 800,000; 900,000; 1,000,000; 2,000,000 or
3,000,000 different genomic DNA regions. The methods described herein can discriminate and
quantitate genomic DNA regions varying by 1 nt or more than 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 30
nt.
10061] In some embodiments, the methods described herein are used to detect and/or quantify
genomic DNA regions such as a region containing a DNA polymorphism. A polymorphism refers to
the occurrence of two or more genetically determined alternative sequences or alleles in a population.
A polymorphic marker or site is the locus at which divergence occurs. Preferred markers have at least
two alleles, each occurring at a frequency of preferably greater than    1%, and more preferably greater
                                                     -12-

than 10% or 20% of a selected population. A polymorphism may comprise one or more base
changes, an insertion, a repeat, or a deletion. A polymorphic locus may be as small as one base pair.
Polymorphic markers include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's),. restriction fragment length
polymorphisms (RFLP's), short tandem repeats (STRs), variable number of tandem repeats
(VNTR's), hypervariable regions, minisatellites, dinucleotide repeats, trinucleotide repeats,
tetranucleotide repeats, simple sequence repeats, and insertion elements such as Alu. A
polymorphism between two nucleic acids can occur naturally, or be caused by exposure to or contact
with chemicals, enzymes, or other agents, or exposure to agents that cause damage to nucleic acids,
for example, ultraviolet radiation, mutagens or carcinogens. In some embodiments, the methods
described herein can discriminate and quantitate a DNA region containing a DNA polymorphism.
The methods described herein can discriminate and quantitate of at least 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 10, 20; 50; 100;
200; 500; 1,000; 2,000; 5,000; 10,000, 20,000; 50,000; 100,000; 200,000; 300,000; 400,000;
500,000; 600,000; 700,000; 800,000; 900,000; 1,000,000; 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 DNA
polymorphism.
10062] In some embodiments, the methods described herein can discriminate and quantitate at least
1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 10; 20; 50; 100; 200; 500; 1,000; 2,000; 5,000; 10,000; 20,000; 50,000; 100,000;

3,000,000 different polymorphic markers.
10063] In some embodiments, the methods described herein can discriminate and quantitate at least
1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 10; 20; 50; 100; 200; 500; 1,000; 2,000; 5,000; 10,000; 20,000; 50,000; 100,000;
200,000; 300,000; 400,000; 500,000; 600,000; 700,000; 800,000; 900,000; 1,000,000; 2,000,000 or
3,000,000 different SNPs.
10064] In some embodiments, the methods described herein are used to detect and/or quantify gene
expression. In some embodiments, the methods described herein provide high discriminative and
quantitative analysis of multiples genes. The methods described herein can discriminate and
quantitate the expression of at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000,
10,000, 20,000, 50,000, 100,000, different target nucleic acids.
10065] In some embodiments, the methods described herein are used to detect and/or quantify gene
expression of genes with similar sequences. The methods described herein can discriminate and
quantitate the expression of genes varying by 1 nt or more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, 15, 20, 21, 22,
24, 25, 30 nt.
10066] In some embodiments, the methods described herein are used to detect and/or quantify
genomic DNA regions by mapping the region to the genome of a species in the case where the
transplant donor and the transplant recipient are not from the same species (e.g., xenotransplants).   In
some embodiments, the methods described herein can discriminate and quantitate a DNA region
from a species. The methods described herein can discriminate and quantitate of at least 1; 2; 3; 4; 5;
10, 20; 50; 100; 200; 500; 1,000; 2,000; 5,000; 10,000, 20,000; 50,000; 100,000; 200,000; 300,000;
                                                     -13-

400,000; 500,000; 600,000; 700,000; 800,000; 900,000; 1,000,000; 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 DNA
regions from a species.
10067] In some embodiments, the methods described herein are used for diagnosing or predicting
transplant status or outcome (e.g. transplant rejection). In some embodiments, the methods described
herein are used to detect and/or quantify target nucleic acids to determine whether a patient or subject
is displaying transplant tolerance. In some embodiments, the methods described herein are used to
detect and/or quantify target nucleic acids for diagnosis or prediction of transplant rejection. In some
embodiments, the methods described herein are used to detect and/or quantify target nucleic acids for
determining an immunosuppressive regimen for a subject who has received a transplant, e.g., an
allograft. In some embodiments, the methods described herein are used to detect and/or quantify
target nucleic acids to predict transplant survival in a subject that have received a transplant. The
invention provides methods of diagnosing or predicting whether a transplant in a transplant patient or
subject will survive or be lost. In certain embodiments, the methods described herein are used to
detect and/or quantify target nucleic acids to diagnose or predict the presence of long-term graft
survival. In some embodiments, the methods described herein are used to detect and/or quantify
target nucleic acids for diagnosis or prediction ofnon-rejection based transplant injury. Examples of
non-rejection based graft injury include, but are not limited to, ischemic injury, virus infection, peri
operative ischemia, reperfusion injury, hypertension, physiological stress, injuries due to reactive
oxygen species and injuries caused by pharmaceutical agents.
10068] As used herein the term "diagnose" or "diagnosis" of a transplant status or outcome includes
predicting or diagnosing the transplant status or outcome, determining predisposition to a transplant
status or outcome, monitoring treatment of transplant patient, diagnosing a therapeutic response of
transplant patient, and prognosis of transplant status or outcome, transplant progression, and response
to particular treatment.
Donor Organ Nucleic Acid Detection and Analysis
10069] In some embodiments, the methods, devices, compositions and kits are used to establish a
genotype for both the donor and the recipient before transplantation to enable the detection of donor
specific nucleic acids such as DNA or RNA in bodily fluids such as blood or urine from the organ
recipient after transplantation. This approach allows for a reliable identification of sequences arising
solely from the organ transplantation that can be made in a manner that is independent of the genders
of donor and recipient.
10070] In some embodiments, a genetic fingerprint is generated for the donor organ. Both the
donor and recipient will be genotyped prior to transplantation. Genotyping of transplant donors and
transplant recipients establishes a profile, using distinguishable markers, for detecting donor nucleic
acids (e.g. circulating cell-free nucleic acid or nucleic acids from circulating donor cells). In some
embodiments, for xenotransplants, nucleic acids from the donors can be mapped to the genome of the
donor species.
                                                    -14-

10071] Following transplantation, samples as described above can be drawn from the patient and
analyzed for markers. The proportion of donor nucleic acids can be monitored over time and an
increase in this proportion can be used to determine transplant status or outcome (e.g. transplant
rejection).
10072] In some embodiments, genotyping comprises detection and quantitation of nucleic acids
from circulating transplant donor cells or circulating cell-free nucleic acids. Examples of nucleic
acids include, but are not limited to double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, single-stranded
DNA hairpins, DNA/RNA hybrids, RNA (e.g. mRNA or miRNA) and RNA hairpins. In some
embodiments, the nucleic acid is DNA. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid is RNA. For
instance, cell-free RNA is also present in human plasma (Tong, Y.K. Lo, Y.M., Clin Chim Acta, 363,
187-196 (2006)) and cDNA sequencing of organ-specific transcripts provides another option to
detect donor-specific nucleic acids arising from cells in the transplanted organ. In some
embodiments, nucleic acids collected from circulating cells in the blood are used.
10073] In some embodiments, genotyping comprises detection and quantitation of polymorphic
markers. Examples of polymorphic markers include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's),
restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP's), variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR's),
short tandem repeats (STRs), hypervariable regions, minisatellites, dinucleotide repeats, trinucleotide
repeats, tetranucleotide repeats, simple sequence repeats, and insertion elements such as Alu. In
some embodiments, genotyping comprises detection and quantitation of STRs. In some
embodiments, genotyping comprises detection and quantitation of VNTRs.
10074] In some embodiments, genotyping comprises detection and quantitation of SNPs. Without
intending to be limited to any theory, any donor and recipient will vary at roughly three million SNP
positions if fully genotyped. Usable SNPs must be homozygous for the recipient and ideally
homozygous for the donor as well. While the majority of these positions will contain SNPs that are
heterozygous for either the donor or the recipient, over 10% (or hundreds of thousands) will be
homozygous for both donor and recipient meaning a direct read of that SNP position can distinguish
donor DNA from recipient DNA. For example, after genotyping a transplant donor and transplant
recipient, using existing genotyping platforms know in the art including the one described herein, one
could identify approximately 1.2 million total variations between a transplant donor and transplant
recipient. Usable SNPs may comprise approximately 500,000 heterozygous donor SNPs and
approximately 160,000 homozygous donor SNPs. Companies (such as Applied Biosystems, Inc.)
currently offer both standard and custom-designed TaqMan probe sets for SNP genotyping that can
in principle target any desired SNP position for a PCR-based assay (Livak, K. L., Marmaro, J., Todd,
J. A., Nature Genetics, 9, 341-342 (1995); De La Vefa, F. M., Lazaruk, K. D., Rhodes, M. D., Wenz,
M. H., Mutation Research, 573, 111-135 (2005)). With such a large pool of potential SNPs to choose
from, a usable subset of existing or custom probes can be selected to serve as the probe set for any
donor/recipient pair. In some embodiments, digital PCR or real-time PCR performed on the nucleic
                                                   -15-

acids recovered from plasma or other biological samples will directly quantitate the percentage of
donor-specific species seen in the sample. In some embodiments, sequencing performed on the
nucleic acid recovered from plasma or other biological samples will directly quantitate the
percentage of donor-specific species seen in the sample. In some embodiments, arrays can be used
on the nucleic acids recovered from plasma or other biological samples to directly quantitate the
percentage of donor-specific species seen in the sample.
10075] Due to the low number of expected reads for any individual nucleic acid (e.g. SNP) in patient
samples, some preamplification of the sample material may be required before analysis to increase
signal levels, but using either preamplification, sampling more target nucleic acid positions (e.g. SNP
positions), or both, will provide a reliable read-out of the transplant donor nucleic acid fraction. Pre
amplification can be preformed using any suitable method known in the art such as multiple
displacement amplification (MDA) (Gonzalez et al. Envircon Microbiol; 7(7); 1024-8 (2005)) or
amplification with outer primers in a nested PCR approach. This permits detection and analysis of
donor nucleic acids even if the total amount of donor nucleic acid in the sample (e.g. blood from
transplant patient) is only up to 1 pag, 500 ng, 200 ng, 100 ng, 50 ng, 40 ng, 30 ng, 20 ng, 10 ng, 5ng,
1 ng , 500 pg, 200 pg, 100 pg, 50 pg, 40 pg, 30 pg, 20 p, 10 pg, 5pg, or 1 pg or between 1 5 pag, 5 10
pag, or 10 50 pag.
         a. PCR
10076] Genotyping donor and recipient nucleic acids, and/or detection, identification and/or
quantitation of the donor-specific nucleic acids after transplantation (e.g. polymorphic markers such
as SNPs) can be performed by PCR. Examples of PCR techniques that can be used to detect, identify
and/or quantitate the donor-specific nucleic acids include, but are not limited, to quantitative PCR,
quantitative fluorescent PCR (QF-PCR), multiplex fluorescent PCR (MF-PCR), real time PCR (RT
PCR), single cell PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR (PCR-RFLP), PCR
RFLP/RT-PCR-RFLP, hot start PCR, nested PCR, in situ polonony PCR, in situ rolling circle
amplification (RCA), bridge PCR, picotiter PCR and emulsion PCR. Other suitable amplification
methods include the ligase chain reaction (LCR), transcription amplification, self-sustained sequence
replication, selective amplification of target polynucleotide sequences, consensus sequence primed
polymerase chain reaction (CP-PCR), arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR),
degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR (DOP-PCR) and nucleic acid based sequence amplification
(NABSA).     Other amplification methods that may be used to amplify specific polymorphic loci
include those described in, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,242,794, 5,494,810, 4,988,617 and 6,582,938. In some
embodiments, Detection, identification and/or quantitation of the donor-specific nucleic acids (e.g.
polymorphic markers such as SNPs) is performed by real-time PCR.
10077] In some embodiments, digital PCR or real time PCR to quantitate the presence of specific
polymorphisms that have already been identified in the initial genotyping step pre-transplantation.
Compared with the quantitative PCR techniques used in some of the earlier cited work, digital PCR
                                                    -16-

is a much more accurate and reliable method to quantitate nucleic acid species including rare nucleic
acid species, and does not require a specific gender relationship between donor and recipient.
(Warren, L., Bryder, D., Weissman, I.L., Quake, S.R., Proc Natl Acad Sci, 103, 17807-17812
(2006)). In some embodiments, digital PCR or real-time PCR assays can be used to quantitate the
fraction of donor DNA in a transplant patient using probes targeted to several SNPs.
         b. Sequencing
10078] Genotyping donor and recipient nucleic acids, and/or detection, identification and/or
quantitation of the donor-specific nucleic acids after transplantation (e.g. polymorphic markers such
as SNPs) can be performed by sequencing such as whole genome sequencing or exome sequencing.
Sequencing can be accomplished through classic Sanger sequencing methods which are well known
in the art. Sequence can also be accomplished using high-throughput systems some of which allow
detection of a sequenced nucleotide immediately after or upon its incorporation into a growing
strand, i.e., detection of sequence in red time or substantially real time. In some cases, high
throughput sequencing generates at least 1,000, at least 5,000, at least 10,000, at least 20,000, at least
30,000, at least 40,000, at least 50,000, at least 100,000 or at least 500,000 sequence reads per hour;
with each read being at least 50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90, at least 100, at least
120 or at least 150 bases per read. Sequencing can be preformed using nucleic acids described herein
such as genomic DNA, cDNA derived from RNA transcripts or RNA as a template.
10079] In some embodiments, high-throughput sequencing involves the use of technology available
by Helicos BioSciences Corporation (Cambridge, Massachusetts) such as the Single Molecule
Sequencing by Synthesis (SMSS) method. SMSS is unique because it allows for sequencing the
entire human genome with no pre amplification step needed. Thus, distortion and nonlinearity in the
measurement of nucleic acids are reduced. This sequencing method also allows for detection of a
SNP nucleotide in a sequence in substantially real time or real time. Finally, as mentioned above,
SMSS is powerful because, like the MIP technology, it does not require a pre amplification step prior
to hybridization. In fact, SMSS does not require any amplification. SMSS is described in part in US

299:682-686, January 2003; as well as US Publication Application No. 20030044781 and
2006/0078937. Overall such system involve sequencing a target nucleic acid molecule having a
plurality of bases by the temporal addition of bases via a polymerization reaction that is measured on
a molecule of nucleic acid, i e., the activity of a nucleic acid polymerizing enzyme on the template
nucleic acid molecule to be sequenced is followed in real time. Sequence can then be deduced by
identifying which base is being incorporated into the growing complementary strand of the target
nucleic acid by the catalytic activity of the nucleic acid polymerizing enzyme at each step in the
sequence of base additions. A polymerase on the target nucleic acid molecule complex is provided in
a position suitable lo move along the target nucleic acid molecule and extend the oligonucleotide
primer at an active site. A plurality of labeled types of nucleotide analogs are provided proximate to
the active site, with each distinguishably type of nucleotide analog being complementary to a
different nucleotide in the target nucleic acid sequence. The growing nucleic acid strand is extended
by using the polymerase to add a nucleotide analog to the nucleic acid strand at the active site, where
the nucleotide analog being added is complementary to the nucleotide of the target nucleic acid at the
active site. The nucleotide analog added to the oligonucleotide primer as a result of the polymerizing
step is identified. The steps of providing labeled nucleotide analogs, polymerizing the growing
nucleic acid strand, and identifying the added nucleotide analog are repeated so that the nucleic acid
strand is further extended and the sequence of the target nucleic acid is determined.

10085] In some embodiments, shotgun sequencing is performed. In shotgun sequencing, DNA is
broken up randomly into numerous small segments, which are sequenced using the chain termination
method to obtain reads. Multiple overlapping reads for the target DNA are obtained by performing
several rounds of this fragmentation and sequencing. Computer programs then use the overlapping
ends of different reads to assemble them into a continuous sequence
10086] In some embodiments, the invention provides methods for detection and quantitation of
SNPs using sequencing. In this case, one can estimate the sensitivity of detection. There are two
components to sensitivity: (i) the number of molecules analyzed (depth of sequencing) and (ii) the
error rate of the sequencing process. Regarding the depth of sequencing, a frequent estimate for the
variation between individuals is that about one base per thousand differs. Currently, sequencers such
as the Illumina Genome Analyzer have read lengths exceeding 36 base pairs. Without intending to
be limited to any theory or specific embodiment, this means that roughly one in 30 molecules
analyzed will have a potential SNP. While the fraction of donor DNA in the recipient blood is
currently not well determined and will depend on organ type, one can take      1%   as a baseline estimate
based on the literature and applicants own studies with heart transplant patients. At this fraction of
donor DNA, approximately one in 3,000 molecules analyzed will be from the donor and informative
about donor genotype. On the Genome Analyzer one can obtain about 10 million molecules per
analysis channel and there are 8 analysis channels per instrument run. Therefore, if one sample is
loaded per channel, one should be able to detect about 3,000 molecules that can be identified as from
the donor in origin, more than enough to make a precise determination of the fraction of donor DNA
using the above parameters. If one wants to establish a lower limit of sensitivity for this method by
requiring at least 100 donor molecules to be detected, then it should have a sensitivity capable of
detecting donor molecules when the donor fraction is as low as 0.03%. Higher sensitivity can be
achieved simply by sequencing more molecules, i.e. using more channels.
10087] The sequencing error rate also affects the sensitivity of this technique. For an average error
rate of 6, the chance of a single SNP being accidentally identified as of donor origin as a result of a
mis-read is roughly E/3. For each individual read, this establishes a lower limit of sensitivity of one's
ability to determine whether the read is due to donor or recipient. Typical sequencing error rates for
base substitutions vary between platforms, but are between 0.5-1.5%. This places a potential limit on
sensitivity of 0.16 to 0.50%. However, it is possible to systematically lower the sequencing error rate
by resequencing the sample template multiple times, as has been demonstrated by Helicos
BioSciences (Harris, T.D., et al., Science, 320, 106-109 (2008)). A single application of
resequencing would reduce the expected error rate of donor SNP detection to ,2/9 or less than .003%.
10088] Figure 5 shows in one embodiments of the inventions a general strategy for monitor all
patients, (i.e., not just female patients receiving male organs), to determine a transplants status or
outcome. Genotyping of donor and recipient can establish a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
profile for detecting donor DNA. Shotgun sequencing of cell-free DNA in plasma, with analysis of
                                                     -19-

observed unique SNPs, allows quantitation of % donor DNA. While any single SNP may be difficult
to detect with so little DNA in plasma, with hundred of thousands or more signals to consider, high
sensitivity should be possible.
         c. Arrays
10089] Genotyping donor and recipient nucleic acids, and/or detection, identification and/or
quantitation of the donor-specific nucleic acids after transplantation (e.g. polymorphic markers such
as SNPs) can be performed using arrays (e.g. SNPs arrays). Results can be visualized using a
scanner that enables the viewing of intensity of data collected and software to detect and quantify
nucleic acid. Such methods are disclosed in part US Patent No. 6,505,125. Another method

The array detection assay can be any array assay known in the art, including the array assays

Methods
10098] In one aspect the invention provides methods for the diagnosis or prediction of transplant
status or outcome in a subject who has received a transplant. The transplant status or outcome may
comprise rejection, tolerance, non-rejection based transplant injury, transplant function, transplant
survival, chronic transplant injury, or titer pharmacological immunosuppression. Examples of non
rejection based allograft injury include, but are not limited to, ischemic injury, virus infection, peri
operative ischemia, reperfusion injury, hypertension, physiological stress, injuries due to reactive
oxygen species and injuries caused by pharmaceutical agents. The transplant status or outcome may
comprise vascular complications or neoplastic involvement of the transplanted organ.
10099] In some embodiments, the invention provides methods of diagnosing or predicting transplant
status or outcome comprising the steps of: (i) providing a sample from a subject who has received a
transplant from a donor; (ii) determining the presence or absence of one or more nucleic acids from
                                                    -22-

the donor transplant, wherein the one or more nucleic acids from the donor are identified based on a
predetermined marker profile; and (iii) diagnosing or predicting transplant status or outcome based
on the presence or absence of the one or more nucleic acids from said donor.
100100] In some embodiments, the methods of the invention are used to establish a genotype for both
the donor and the recipient before transplantation. In some embodiments, the genotyping of both the
donor and the recipient before transplantation enables the detection of donor-specific nucleic acids
such as DNA or RNA in bodily fluids as described herein (e.g., blood or urine) from the organ
recipient after transplantation. In some embodiments a marker profile for the donor is determined
based on the genotyping of the transplant donor. In some embodiments, a marker profile is
determined for the transplant recipient based on the genotyping of the transplant recipient. In some
embodiments, a marker profile is established by selecting markers that are distinguishable between
the transplant donor and the subject receiving the transplant. This approach allows for a reliable
identification of nucleic acids arising solely from the organ transplantation that can be made in a
manner that is independent of the genders of donor and recipient.
100101] Genotyping of the transplant donor and/or the transplant recipient may be performed by any
suitable method known in the art including those described herein such as sequencing, nucleic acid
array or PCR. In some embodiments, genotyping of the transplant donor and/or the transplant
recipient is performed by shotgun sequencing. In some embodiments, genotyping of the transplant
donor and/or the transplant recipient is performed using a DNA array. In some embodiments,
genotyping of the transplant donor and/or the transplant recipient is performed using a polymorphism
array such as a SNP array.
100102] In some embodiments, the marker profile is a polymorphic marker profile. Polymorphic
marker profile may comprise one or more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's), one or more
restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP's), one or more short tandem repeats (STRs), one
or more variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR's), one or more hypervariable regions, one or
more minisatellites, one or more dinucleotide repeats, one or more trinucleotide repeats, one or more
tetranucleotide repeats, one or more simple sequence repeats, or one or more insertion elements. In
some embodiments, the marker profile comprises at least 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 10; 20; 50; 100; 200; 500;
1,000; 2,000; 5,000; 10,000; 20,000; 50,000; 100,000; 200,000; 300,000; 400,000; 500,000; 600,000;
700,000; 800,000; 900,000; 1,000,000; 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 different polymorphic markers.
100103] In some embodiments, the polymorphic marker profile comprises one or more SNPs. In
some embodiments, the marker profile comprises at least 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 10; 20; 50; 100; 200; 500;
1,000; 2,000; 5,000; 10,000; 20,000; 50,000; 100,000; 200,000; 300,000; 400,000; 500,000; 600,000;
700,000; 800,000; 900,000; 1,000,000; 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 different SNPs.
100104] Following transplantation, samples as described above can be drawn from the patient and
analyzed for the presence or absence of one or more nucleic acids from the transplant donor. In some
embodiments, the sample is blood, plasma, serum or urine. The proportion and/or amount of donor
                                                   -23-

nucleic acids can be monitored over time and an increase in this proportion can be used to determine
transplant status or outcome (e.g. transplant rejection).
100105] The presence or absence of one or more nucleic acids from the transplant donor in the
transplant recipient may be determined by any suitable method known in the art including those
described herein such as sequencing, nucleic acid arrays or PCR. In some embodiments, the
presence or absence of one or more nucleic acids from the transplant donor in the transplant recipient
is determined by shotgun sequencing. In some embodiments, the presence or absence of one or more
nucleic acids from the transplant donor in the transplant recipient is determined using a DNA array.
In some embodiments, the presence or absence of one or more nucleic acids from the transplant
donor in the transplant recipient is determined using a polymorphism array such as a SNP array.
100106] In some embodiments, where the transplant is a xenotransplant, detection, identification
and/or quantitation of the donor-specific markers can be performed by mapping one or more nucleic
acids (e.g., DNA) to the genome of the specie use to determine whether the one or more nucleic acids
come from the transplant donor. Polymorphic markers as described above can also be used where
the transplant is a xenotransplant.
100107] In some embodiments, the presence or absence of circulating DNA or RNA from a transplant
donor in a transplant recipient is used to determine the transplant status or outcome. The DNA can
be double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA hairpins, or cDNA. The RNA
can be single stranded RNA or RNA hairpins. In some embodiments, the presence or absence of
circulating DNA/RNA hybrids from a transplant donor in a transplant recipient is used to determine
the transplant status or outcome. In some embodiments, the presence or absence of circulating
mRNA from a transplant donor in a transplant recipient is used to determine the transplant status or
outcome. In some embodiments, the presence or absence of circulating DNA from a transplant donor
in a transplant recipient is used to determine the transplant status or outcome. In some embodiments,
cDNA is used to determine the transplant status or outcome. The DNA or RNA can be obtained
from circulating donor cells. Alternative, the DNA or RNA can be circulating cell-free DNA or
circulating cell-free RNA
100108] In any of the embodiments described herein, the transplant graft maybe any solid organ and
skin transplant. Examples of transplants, whose transplant status or outcome could be determined by
the methods described herein, include but are not limited to, kidney transplant, heart transplant, liver
transplant, pancreas transplant, lung transplant, intestine transplant and skin transplant.
100109] In some embodiments, the invention provides methods of determining whether a patient or
subject is displaying transplant tolerance. In some embodiments the invention provides methods for
diagnosis or prediction of transplant rejection. The term "transplant rejection" encompasses both
acute and chronic transplant rejection. In some embodiments, the invention further includes methods
for determining an immunosuppressive regimen for a subject who has received a transplant, e.g., an
allograft. In some embodiments, the invention further includes methods for determining the

effectiveness of an immunosuppressive regimen for a subject who has received a transplant. Certain
embodiments of the invention provide methods of predicting transplant survival in a subject that has
received a transplant. The invention provides methods of diagnosing or predicting whether a
transplant in a transplant patient or subject will survive or be lost. In certain embodiments, the
invention provides methods of diagnosing or predicting the presence of long-term graft survival. In
some embodiments, the invention provides methods for diagnosis or prediction of non-rejection
based transplant injury. Examples of non-rejection based graft injury include, but are not limited to,
ischemic injury, virus infection, peri-operative ischemia, reperfusion injury, hypertension,
physiological stress, injuries due to reactive oxygen species and injuries caused by pharmaceutical
agents. In some embodiments, the invention provides methods for diagnosis or prediction of
vascular complications or neoplastic involvement of the transplanted organ.
100110] In some embodiments, the amount of one or more nucleic acids from the transplant donor in
a sample from the transplant recipient is used to determine the transplant status or outcome. Thus, in
some embodiments, the methods of the invention further comprise quantitating the one or more
nucleic acids from the transplant donor. In some embodiments, the amount of one or more nucleic
acids from the donor sample is determined as a percentage of total the nucleic acids in the sample. In
some embodiments, the amount of one or more nucleic acids from the donor sample is determined as
a ratio of the total nucleic acids in the sample. In some embodiments, the amount of one or more
nucleic acids from the donor sample is determined as a ratio or percentage compared to one or more
reference nucleic acids in the sample. For instance, the amount of one or more nucleic acids from the
transplant donor can be determined to be 10% of the total nucleic acids in the sample. Alternatively,
the amount of one or more nucleic acids from the transplant donor can be at a ratio of 1:10 compared
to total nucleic acids in the sample. Further, the amount of one or more nucleic acids from the
transplant donor can be determined to be 10% or at a ratio of 1:10 of a reference gene such a
globin. In some embodiments, the amount of one or more nucleic acids from the transplant donor
can be determined as a concentration. For example, the amount of one or more nucleic acids from
the donor sample can be determined to be 1 ug/mL.
100111] In some embodiments, the amount of one or more nucleic acids from the transplant donor
above a predetermined threshold value is indicative of a transplant status or outcome. For example,
the normative values for clinically stable post-transplantation patients with no evidence of graft
rejection or other pathologies can be determined. An increase in the amount of one or more nucleic
acids from the transplant donor above the normative values for clinically stable post-transplantation
patients could indicate a change in transplant status or outcome such as transplant rejection or
transplant injury. On the other hand, an amount of one or more nucleic acids from the transplant
donor below or at the normative values for clinically stable post-transplantation patients could
indicate graft tolerance or graft survival.
                                                    -25-

100112] In some embodiments, different predetermined threshold values are indicative of different
transplant outcomes or status. For example, as discussed above, an increase in the amount of one or
more nucleic acids from the transplant donor above the normative values for clinically stable post
transplantation patients could indicate a change in transplant status or outcome such as transplant
rejection or transplant injury. However, an increase in the amount of one or more nucleic acids from
the transplant donor above the normative values for clinically stable post-transplantation patients but
below a predetermined threshold level could indicate a less serious condition such as a viral infection
rather than transplant rejection. An increase in the amount of one or more nucleic acids from the
transplant donor above a higher threshold could indicate transplant rejection.
100113] In some embodiments, temporal differences in the amount of said one or more nucleic acids
from the transplant donor are indicative of a transplant status or outcome. For instance, a transplant
patient can be monitored over time to determine the amount of one or more nucleic acids from the
transplant donor. A temporary increase in the amount of one or more nucleic acids from the
transplant donor, which subsequently return to normal values, might indicate a less serious condition
rather than transplant rejection. On the other hand, a sustained increase in the amount one or more
nucleic acids from the transplant donor might indicate a serious condition such as transplant
rejection.
100114] In some embodiments, temporal differences in the amount of said one or more nucleic acids
from the transplant donor can be used to monitor effectiveness of an immunosuppressant treatment or
to select an immunosuppressant treatment. For instance, the amount of one or more nucleic acids
from the transplant donor can be determined before and after an immunosuppressant treatment. A
decrease in the one or more nucleic acids from the transplant donor after treatment may indicate that
the treatment was successful in preventing transplant rejection. Additionally, the amount of one or
more nucleic acids from the transplant donor can be used to choose between immunosuppressant
treatments, for examples, immunosuppressant treatments of different strengths. For example, a
higher amount in one or more nucleic acids from the transplant donor may indicate that there is a
need of a very potent immunosuppressant, whereas a lower amount in one or more nucleic acids from
the transplant donor may indicate that a less potent immunosuppressant may be used.
100115] The invention provides methods that sensitive and specific. In some embodiments, the
methods described herein for diagnosing or predicting transplant status or outcome have at least 56
%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 100% sensitivity. In some embodiments, the methods described
herein have at least 56 % sensitivity. In some embodiments, the methods described herein have at
least 78 % sensitivity. In some embodiments, the methods described herein have a specificity of
about 70% to about 100%. In some embodiments, the methods described herein have a specificity of
about 80% to about 100%. In some embodiments, the methods described herein have a specificity of
about 90% to about 100%. In some embodiments, the methods described herein have a specificity of
about 100%.
                                                   -26-

100116] Also provided herein are methods for screening and identifying markers recognizing a donor
nucleic acid that can be useful in the methods described herein, e.g. diagnosing or predicting
transplant status or outcome. In some embodiments, the donor nucleic acid is cell-free DNA or DNA
isolated from circulating donor cells.
100117] Donor nucleic acid can be identified by the methods described herein including the methods
described in the Examples. After identifying these, then one could look at the donor nucleic acids
and examine them for their correlation with transplant status and outcomes such as chronic graft
injury, rejection, and tolerance. In some embodiments, the longitudinal change of donor nucleic
acids is studied. If clinically significant, these levels could be followed to titer pharmacological
immunosuppression, or could be studied as a target for depletion.

100118] Also provided are reagents and kits thereof for practicing one or more of the above-described
methods. The subject reagents and kits thereof may vary greatly. Reagents of interest include
reagents specifically designed for use in production of the above-described: (i) genotyping of a
transplant donor and a transplant recipient; (ii) identification of marker profiles; and (ii) detection
and/or quantitation of one or more nucleic acids from a transplant donor in a sample obtained from a
transplant recipient.
100119] One type of such reagents are one or more probes or an array of probes to genotype and/or to
detect and/or to quantitate one or more nucleic acids. A variety of different array formats are known
in the art, with a wide variety of different probe structures, substrate compositions and attachment
technologies.
100120] The kits of the subject invention may include the above-described arrays. Such kits may

100122] Such kits may also include information, such as scientific literature references, package
insert materials, clinical trial results, and/or summaries of these and the like, which indicate or
establish the activities and/or advantages of the composition, and/or which describe dosing,
administration, side effects, drug interactions, or other information useful to the health care provider.
Such kits may also include instructions to access a database. Such information may be based on the
results of various studies, for example, studies using experimental animals involving in vivo models
and studies based on human clinical trials. Kits described herein can be provided, marketed and/or
promoted to health providers, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, formulary officials, and the
like. Kits may also, in some embodiments, be marketed directly to the consumer.

Computer Program
100123] Any of the methods above can be performed by a computer program product that comprises
a computer executable logic that is recorded on a computer readable medium. For example, the
computer program can execute some or all of the following functions: (i) controlling isolation of
nucleic acids from a sample, (ii) pre-amplifying nucleic acids from the sample, (iii) amplifying,
sequencing or arraying specific polymorphic regions in the sample, (iv) identifying and quantifying a
marker profile in the sample, (v) comparing data on marker profile detected from the sample with a
predetermined threshold, (vi) determining a transplant status or outcome , (vi) declaring normal or
abnormal transplant status or outcome. In particular, the computer executable logic can analyze data
on the detection and quantity of polymorphism(s) (e.g. SNPs).
100124] The computer executable logic can work in any computer that may be any of a variety of
types of general-purpose computers such as a personal computer, network server, workstation, or
other computer platform now or later developed. In some embodiments, a computer program product
is described comprising a computer usable medium having the computer executable logic (computer
software program, including program code) stored therein. The computer executable logic can be
executed by a processor, causing the processor to perform functions described herein. In other
embodiments, some functions are implemented primarily in hardware using, for example, a hardware
state machine. Implementation of the hardware state machine so as to perform the functions
described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the relevant arts.
100125] The program can provide a method of evaluating a transplant status or outcome in a
transplant recipient by accessing data that reflects the genotyping of the transplant donor and the
transplant patient, and/or the presence or absence of one or more nucleic acids from the transplant
donor in the circulation of the transplant patient post-transplantation.
100126] In one embodiment, the computer executing the computer logic of the invention may also
include a digital input device such as a scanner. The digital input device can provide information on
a nucleic acid, e.g., polymorphism levels/quantity. For example, a scanner of this invention can
provide an image of the polymorphism (e.g., SNPs) according to method herein. For instance, a
scanner can provide an image by detecting fluorescent, radioactive, or other emission; by detecting
transmitted, reflected, or scattered radiation; by detecting electromagnetic properties or other
characteristics; or by other techniques. The data detected is typically stored in a memory device in
the form of a data file. In one embodiment, a scanner may identify one or more labeled targets. For
instance, a first DNA polymorphism may be labeled with a first dye that fluoresces at a particular
characteristic frequency, or narrow band of frequencies, in response to an excitation source of a
particular frequency. A second DNA polymorphism may be labeled with a second dye that
fluoresces at a different characteristic frequency. The excitation sources for the second dye may, but
need not, have a different excitation frequency than the source that excites the first dye, e.g., the
excitation sources could be the same, or different, lasers.
                                                    -28-

100127] In some embodiments, the invention provides a computer readable medium comprising a set
of instructions recorded thereon to cause a computer to perform the steps of (i) receiving data from
one or more nucleic acids detected in a sample from a subject who has received transplant from a
donor, wherein said one or more nucleic acids are nucleic acids from said donor transplant, and
wherein said one or more nucleic acids from said donor are identified based on a predetermined
marker profile; and (ii) diagnosing or predicting transplant status or outcome based on the presence
or absence of the one or more nucleic acids.
                                              EXAMPLES
Example 1: Detection of Donor DNA in Organ Transplant Recipients
100128] Using digital PCR as described before (Warren, L., Bryder, D., Weissman, I.L., Quake, S.R.,
Proc Natl Acad Sci, 103, 17807-17812 (2006); Fan, H.C. Quake, S.R., Anal Chem, 79, 7576-7579
(2007)), the amount of chromosome Y and chromosome 1 markers were quantitated for female
patients receiving either male or female hearts in plasma samples taken at the same time that an
endomyocardial biopsy determined a grade 3A or 3B rejection episode.
100129] While blood transfusions/male child birth are known mechanisms to have detectable cY
signature in a female patient, Figure 2 shows that the overall levels of cY are uniformly higher for
patients receiving hearts from male donors. No significant chromosome Y signal from four control
female-to-female transplant patients was detected. On the other hand, 1.5-8% total genomic fraction
for chromosome Y signals was observed at the rejection time points for three male-to-female
transplant patients across four rejection episodes.
100130] Levels of chromosome Y in plasma were monitored at several time points following
transplantation for some of these patients, and compared with biopsy time points for organ rejection.
For patient 6, a 3A grade rejection was detected after biopsy 21 months after transplant. The level of
chromosome Y detected in plasma was neglible in plasma at three months prior to rejection, but
increased >10-fold to 2% of total genomic fraction at the time a biopsy determined rejection. The
highest levels of cY in the plasma DNA are seen at this time (Figure 3). The results in Figure 3
suggest that the overall levels of cell-free DNA in the plasma are not diagnostic of organ failure and
do not track the "donor-specific" DNA signal
100131] Similar trends were observed for another patient that had cY levels increasing at 5 months
after transplant when a biopsy detected a grade 3A rejection (Figure 4). The percentage of cY (or %
"Donor") DNA is increasing before and highest at rejection time. Like above, the amount of total
cell-free DNA does not seem diagnostic for heart rejection
100132] Collectively, these results establish that for heart transplant patients, donor-derived DNA
present in plasma can serve as a potential marker for the onset of organ failure.
                                                    -29-

Example 2: Genotyping of Transplant Donor and Transplant Recipient
100133] Figure 5 shows a general strategy to monitor all transplant patients. Genotyping of donor
and recipient can establish a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profile for detecting donor DNA.
Shotgun sequencing of cell-free DNA in plasma, with analysis of observed unique SNPs, allows
quantitation of % Donor DNA in the sample. While any single SNP may be difficult to detect with
so little DNA in plasma, with hundred of thousands or more signals to consider, high sensitivity
should be possible
100134] Libraries of mixed genotypes can be created using two CEU (Mormon, Utah) HapMap lines.
Approximately 1.2 million total variations between these two individuals were already established
using existing genotyping platforms (e.g., Illumina Golden Gate). Usable SNPs must be
homozygous for the recipient and ideally homozygous for the donor as well. Usable SNPs comprise:
(i) approximately 500,000 heterozygous donor SNPs (count will be 1/2 of total donor fraction), (ii)
approximately 160,000 homozygous donor SNPs.
100135] Sequencing Results: 4 lanes of Illumina sequencing are used to compare 4 different levels of
substitution of Donor DNA into Recipient DNA (See Figure 6). Error rate of sequencing is currently
 ~0.3-0.5% for base substitution. The use of quality scores for improved filtering of SNP calls, or the
use of resequencing, should reduce error rate and increase sensitivity. The use of more SNP
locations (from full genotyping) should also improve yield of signal with no change in protocol.
100136] While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described
herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of
example only. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the
art without departing from the invention. It should be understood that various alternatives to the
embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention. It is
intended that the following claims define the scope of the invention and that methods and structures
within the scope of these claims and their equivalents be covered thereby.
