             TECHNICAL METHOD FOR INCREASING EFFICIENCY OF SYSTEMIC
                                            HERBICIDE
       TECHNICAL FIELD
       The present invention relates to the technical field of biochemical pesticides, in particular to
a technical method for increasing the efficiency of a systemic herbicide.
          BACKGROUND
       Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as
an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the
field.
       The systemic herbicides (hereinafter referred to as herbicides) are herbicides that are
sprayed on the stems and leaves of plants and then absorbed and transmitted to other leaves,
flowers, fruits and roots, or herbicides that are sprayed on the soil surface and then absorbed by
plant roots and transmitted to the stems, leaves, flowers and fruits, thus interfering with the
physiological functions of plants and stopping the growth of plants or killing them. This type of
herbicides accounts for the vast majority of herbicides, such as metsulfuron-methyl (of
sulfonylureas), propyzamide and isoproturon (of amides), glufosinate (of organophosphates),
imazamox (of imazapyrs), dicamba (of carboxylic acids), and isoxaflutole (of organic heterocyclic
compounds) and so on.
       With the development of agriculture and the broad application of herbicides, many weeds
have become drug-resistant. Besides, there are complex weed species, with monocotyledonous,
dicotyledonous and broadleaf weed species mixed. Therefore, there is a phenomenon that the
agricultural single-mu application dosage of herbicides is increasingly higher but the effect has
not been obviously improved. Excessive application of herbicides could potentially harm the
environment and crops. The present invention has been made to solve the above problems.
       CONTENTS OF THE INVENTION
       It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the

disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.
      An object of a preferred embodiment of the present invention is to provide a technical
method for increasing the efficiency of a systemic herbicide; that is, the herbicide is combined
with a potentiator and an additive acceptable for pesticides to produce a preparation, and thus a
class of compound herbicides with a synergistic effect is produced that can be used for farmland,
orchards, turf, and non-cultivated land to prevent and remove weeds.
      According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a technical method for
increasing efficiency of a systemic herbicide, wherein: the systemic herbicide is combined with a
potentiator and an additive acceptable for pesticides to produce a compound herbicide

       In the technical solution of the present invention, the herbicides and potentiators can be
recombined according to experimental results.
       In the technical solution of the present invention, the form of the compound herbicides
includes aqueous suspensions, oil suspensions, soluble powder, wettable powder, soluble
granules, water-dispersible granules, dry suspensions, tablets and the like, with water-dispersible

       In the technical solution of the present invention, the compound herbicide with a synergistic
effect is composed of a herbicide, an amino acid and an additive acceptable for pesticides, with
the mass ratio of propyzamide to the amino acid at 100:0.1 to 100:1000, preferably 100:1 to
100:100.

       In the technical solution of the present invention, the compound herbicide with a synergistic
effect is composed of isoxaflutole, brassinolide and an additive acceptable for pesticides, with the
mass ratio of isoxaflutole to brassinolide at 100:0.005 to 100:10, preferably 100:0.01 to 100:0.05.
       In the technical solution of the present invention, the compound herbicide with a synergistic
effect is composed of glufosinate, indoleacetic acid and an additive acceptable for pesticides,
with the mass ratio of glufosinate to indoleacetic acid at 100:0.05 to 100:10, preferably 100:0.01
to 100:0.5.
       In the technical solution of the present invention, the compound herbicide with a synergistic
effect is composed of glufosinate, gibberellic acid and an additive acceptable for pesticides, with
the mass ratio of glufosinate to gibberellic acid at 100:0.1 to 100:200, preferably 100:0.1 to
100:10.
       The present invention adds a potentiator to the herbicide to produce a suitable preparation.
When the roots, stems and leaves of weeds absorb the potentiator, the physiological functions of
weeds can be activated, thereby increasing or accelerating absorption of the herbicide by plants
and accelerating death of weeds. The protected crops, because of metabolizing the herbicide, will
not have adverse effects. Therefore, the biological activity of the herbicide can be increased and
the amount of the herbicide can be reduced.
       According to this principle, a series of compound herbicides can be produced, such as
sulfonylurea herbicide + brassinolide, organophosphorus herbicide + gibberellic acid, and organic
heterocyclic herbicide + brassinolide, specifically, e.g., metsulfuron-methyl + indoleacetic acid,
imazamox + indoleacetic acid, propyzamide + amino acid, isoproturon + amino acid, glufosinate
+ gibberellic acid, dicamba + gibberellic acid, isoxaflutole + brassinolide, propyzamide +
brassinolide, and the like. The compound herbicide of the present invention can obviously
improve the weeding biological activity by 5% to 25% compared with that of the herbicide alone.
       Propyzamide, as a systemic selective amide herbicide, has an action mechanism of
interfering with the orderly division of weed cells through the root absorption and conduction. It is
mainly used for the prevention and removal of monocotyledons, and safe for broad-leaved crops.
Its persistence in the soil is up to 60 days or so. It can effectively control the emergence of weeds
and, even after the emergence, can still cause the weeds to die due to their absorption of this
herbicide through coleoptiles. Propyzamide is a selective herbicide for post-emergence treatment

at an application dosage of 0.56 ~ 2 kgAI/ha.
       Glufosinate (CAS No. 77182-82-2), as a non-selective foliar-sprayed organophosphorus
herbicide, is a glutamine synthesis inhibitor and a non-selective touch herbicide. Being systemic
to some extent, it can be used for weeding in orchards, vineyards and non-cultivated lands, and
can prevent and remove annual or perennial dicotyledons as well as gramineous weeds and
sedges and so on. The amount used varies depending on the crops and weeds. The amount of
glufosinate, when used alone, is 1 to 2 kg or more per hectare, such as 1.5 to 20 kg/hm2 when
glufosinate is used for the prevention and removal of raspberries and ferns in forests and on
alpine pastures.
       Isoxaflutole, as an efficient organic heterocyclic herbicide with low toxicity, is a kind of
organic heterocyclic selective systemic pre-emergence herbicide that is used for soil treatment in
the fields of dry crops such as corn, sugar cane and the like, and functions primarily through the
absorption and conduction of young roots of weeds. This herbicide, after being absorbed by
sensitive    weeds,     destroys   the  formation     of   chlorophyll through   the   inhibition of
hydroxyphenylacetone dioxygenase, resulting in the chlorosis and wilting of the weeds. When
isoxaflutole is applied or has been applied, its active ingredients that are retained in the surface
soil due to poor soil moisture cannot be decomposed for a long time although they cannot play a
role of preventing and removing weeds in time, and can still play their role of preventing and
removing weeds when there is rainfall or irrigation, and can even kill and inhibit sensitive weeds
that have grown to 4 to 5 leaves, with the application dosage at 90 to 120 g/ha.
       Brassinolide, which is a plant hormone, is an efficient, broad-spectrum, safe multi-purpose
plant growth regulator, and also known as a sixth-generation plant growth regulator. It can fully
stimulate the intrinsic potential of plants, fully regulate and promote the growth of plants, make
plants give full play to their growth advantages, and promote the division, elongation and growth
of plant cells, with the application dosage at 0.015 g/ha.
       Gibberellic acid is a widespread plant hormone. Its chemical structure belongs to diterpene
acid, and is derived from the four-ring framework. It can stimulate the growth of leaves and buds.
Its most significant physiological effect is to promote the elongation and division of cells and
speed up growth of plants, with the application dosage at 1.5 to 3 g/ha.
       The amino acid of plant nutrients can speed up the transport and accumulation of nutrients,

and enhance plants' resistance to cold, drought, disease and so on. It has a significant role in
promoting     plants' rooting, growth,    reproduction,   bearing fruits, enlargement      and other
reproductive stages, with the application dosage at 10 to 30 g/ha.
       Definition of terms
       1. Systemic herbicide (hereinafter referred to as herbicide): It refers to a herbicide that is
sprayed on the stems and leaves of plants and absorbed by plants to be transferred to other
leaves, flowers, fruits and roots, or a herbicide that is sprayed on the soil surface and absorbed
by the roots of plants and then transmitted to stems, leaves, flowers and fruits to interfere with the
physiological functions of plants to stop the plants from growing or kill them. This type of herbicide
accounts for the vast majority of herbicides, such as metsulfuron-methyl (of sulfonylureas),
propyzamide and isoproturon (of amides), glufosinate (of organophosphates), imazamox (of
imazapyrs), dicamba (of carboxylic acids), and isoxaflutole (of organic heterocyclic compounds)
and so on.
       2. Potentiator: It refers to a substance that is mixed with the above herbicide and then
sprayed on the stems and leaves of plants or sprayed on the soil surface to be absorbed by the
leaves or roots of plants so as to regulate and promote the growth of plants, such as plant
hormones (brassinolide, indoleacetic acid, gibberellic acid, etc.) and plant nutrients (amino acids,
etc.).
       3. Compound herbicide: It refers to a preparation that is produced by combining the above
pesticide with a potentiator and an additive acceptable for pesticides.
       4. Comprise, comprising, and the like: Unless the context clearly requires otherwise,
throughout the description and the claims, the words "comprise", "comprising", and the like are to be
construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in
the sense of "including, but not limited to".
       Compared with the prior art, the synergistic compound herbicide according to preferred
embodiments of the present invention has the following advantages:
       1. It can significantly improve the weeding biological activity compared with the use of a
single ingredient;
       2. combining two active ingredients can reduce the dosage, costs and environmental
pollution; and

       3. re-combination can be made through experiments.
      The compound herbicide with a synergistic effect of the present invention combines a
potentiator with a herbicide. Since plant hormones or plant nutrients can promote the growth of
plants and enhance the absorption and conduction of plants in vivo, the herbicide is more and
faster to be absorbed by weeds, thereby significantly increasing the rate of poisoning weeds and
thus improving the efficacy.
         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS
      The above solution is further described below in combination with specific examples. It
should be understood that these examples are for the purpose of illustrating the present invention
and are not intended to limit the scope thereof. The implementation conditions adopted in the
examples can be further adjusted according to the conditions of specific manufacturers, and
undefined implementation conditions are usually the conditions in a routine experiment.
       Introduction and overview
      The present invention is illustrated by way of examples and not by way of limitation. It
should be noted that "an" embodiment described in this disclosure does not necessarily refer to
the same embodiment, but rather means at least one.
      Various aspects of the present invention will be described below. However, it will be
apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced in accordance with
only some or all aspects of the present invention. For the purpose of explanation, this document
gives specific numbers, materials, and configurations to enable one to thoroughly understand the
present invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention
may be practiced without the specific details. In other examples, well-known features have been
omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the present invention.
      Various embodiments will be described in terms of typical types of reactants. It will be
apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced using any
amount of different kinds of reactants and not just those reactors given herein for illustrative
purposes. In addition, it will also be apparent that the present invention is not limited to any
particular mixing examples.
      A co-toxicity coefficient test method in the examples: Putting 25   x 25 cm culture dishes in

an artificial test box, selectively leaving 100 normal 2-leaf weeds in each of the culture dishes,
adding a small amount of sterile water, maintaining normal light, culturing at a constant
temperature of 25C and a constant humidity of 50% for 3 days, and finally selectively leaving 50
normally growing weeds in each culture dish for future use.
       Test range: Setting a total of 8 groups including a single herbicide and 7 different
proportions of herbicide + potentiator, spraying them on weeds at different concentration
gradients (with distilled water as the diluent), and using distilled water as a blank control; spraying
each of the liquids on two culture dishes, observing the test results after 14 days, and calculating
and correcting mortality by regarding two or more completely yellow leaves as a sign of plant
death.
       The corrected mortality for each treatment was calculated based on the survey data, and
the co-toxicity coefficient (CTC         value) was calculated by         Sun Yunpei's method        (cf.
NY/T1154.1-2006). The co-toxicity coefficient (CTC value) greater than or equal to 120 showed a
synergistic effect, the co-toxicity coefficient (CTC value)     80 showed an antagonism effect, and
80 < the co-toxicity coefficient (CTC value) < 120 showed an additive effect.

       The results of the determination of the combined effect of the different proportions of
propyzamide and amino acid (at a mass ratio of propyzamide to amino acid from 100:0.1 to
100:1000) on the killing of amur foxtail showed that:
       1. When propyzamide:amino acid was from 100:1 to 100:100, the CTC value of killing amur
foxtail was greater than or equal to 120, showing that there was a synergistic effect on the
combined effect of the combination of propyzamide and amino acid on the killing of weeds, with
propyzamide:amino acid at 100:10 the best and showing an excellent preventive effect, indicating
that the combination of propyzamide and amino acid was reasonable and feasible.
       2. However, with the increased proportion of amino acids, the preventive effect was
reduced, showing that the increased effect of amino acids caused the weeds to be protected and
thus the preventive effect to be reduced.

glufosinate and gibberellic acid (at a mass ratio of glufosinate to gibberellic acid from 100:0.1 to
100:200) for the killing of barnyard grass showed that:
         1. When glufosinate:gibberellic acid was from 100:0.1 to 100:10, the CTC value for the
killing of barnyard grass was greater than or equal to 120, indicating that there was a synergistic
effect on the combined effect of the combination of glufosinate and gibberellic acid on the killing
of barnyard grass, with glufosinate:gibberellic acid at 100:10 the best and showing an excellent
preventive effect, indicating that the combination of glufosinate and gibberellic acid was
reasonable and feasible.
           2. However, with the increased proportion of gibberellic acid, the preventive effect was
reduced, showing that the increased effect of gibberellic acid caused the plants to be protected
and thus the preventive effect to be reduced.
