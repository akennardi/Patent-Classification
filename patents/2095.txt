Field of the Invention
      The present invention relates to a coupling structure, in particular to a bathroom
quick coupling.
Description of the Prior Art
      When running water is provided for a bathroom or a restroom, the running water
should be connected to a facet for controlling the turn-on and turn-off of the water and
related pipes before being used.     As shown in Fig. 4, a conventional coupling for
connecting adjacent pipes 51, 52 is provided and the coupling includes a packing piece
61 and a nut 62, the pipe 51 has a threaded portion 511 and a tapered section 512 near
the opening of the pipe 51 in which the inner diameter of the tapered section 512
gradually decreases in a direction opposite to the opening of the pipe 51.            The
packing piece 61 is fitted over the pipe 52 and one end of the packing piece 61 has a
guiding section 611 corresponding to the profile of the tapered section 512.        When
the nut 62 is threaded with the threaded section 511 of the pipe 51, the nut 62 pushes
the guiding section 611 of the packing piece 61 to abut against the tapered section 512,
so that the nut 62 packs the packing piece 61 to engage with and position with the pipe
52, and the two adjacent pipes 51, 52 can be connected with each other.
      However, in the conventional, two components, that is the packing piece 61 and
the nut 62 are used, and a user has to use tools such as pliers during the operation.
Consequently, the conventional coupling has many components and the assembling of
the conventional coupling with the pipes is complicated.

                          SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      One object of the present invention is to provide a bathroom quick coupling in
which a flexible positioning clamp is used to engage with a pipe to be connected
without other components for the positioning.          Therefore, the coupling has fewer
components and is easy to be operated.
      In view of these, a bathroom quick coupling is provided.        In one embodiment,
the bathroom quick coupling comprises a main body and a positioning clamp.            One
end of the main body has a connecting end for connecting to an external pipe.           A
hollow room is recessed from the connecting end to form an opening.            The hollow
room has a thin section and an expanded section.        An inner diameter of the expanded
section is greater than an inner diameter of the thin section.    The expanded section is
connected to a first side of the thin section distant from the opening.   The positioning
clamp has a base in ring shaped.       A plurality of clamping blocks is extending from
one side of the base.      The clamping blocks surround the base and are arranged
spacedly with each other for engaging with and positioned with the external pipe.
Each of the clamping blocks is slightly deformable within a gap between adjacent
clamping blocks.      The positioning clamp is in the hollow room, and the clamping
blocks are correspondingly extending to the expanded section.
      In one embodiment, the inner diameter of the expanded section gradually
increases in a direction opposite to the opening.
      In one embodiment, a second side of the thin section near the opening is
connected to a guiding section, and an inner diameter of the guiding section gradually
increases in a direction toward the opening.
                                              2

      In one embodiment, a reverse-tooth portion is protruding from an inner side of
each of the clamping blocks of the positioning clamp.
      In one embodiment, a protruding portion is on an outer side of each of the
clamping blocks of the positioning clamp, and an outer diameter of the positioning
clamp is a distance between outer peripheries of the protruding portions of two
opposite clamping blocks, and the outer diameter of the positioning clamp is greater
than the inner diameter of the thin section.

         DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
      Please refer to Figs. 1 and 2, illustrating a bathroom quick coupling according to
an embodiment of the present invention.         The bathroom quick coupling comprises a
main body 1 in tubular shaped, the main body 1 has a water source end 11 for
connecting to running water and a connecting end 12 for connecting to an external
pipe.   A valve 13 is between the water source end 11 and the connecting end 12 of
the main body 1 for controlling the water stream.
      Moreover, a hollow room 2 is recessed from the connecting end 12 of the main
                                               3

body 1 to form an opening 21.     The hollow room 2 has at least one annular groove
22, and a sealing ring 221 is assembled in each of the at least one sealing ring 22.
Hence, when the external pipe is inserted into the hollow room 2, the external pipe is
enclosed by the sealing ring 221 to perform sealing.   A portion of the hollow room 2
near the opening 21 has a thin section 23, and the hollow room 2 has an expanded
section 24, the expanded section 24 is connected to a first side of the thin section 23
distant from the opening 21, and an inner diameter of the expanded section 24 is
greater than an inner diameter of the thin section 23.     The inner diameter of the
expanded section 24 gradually increases in a direction opposite to the opening 21.
Furthermore, a second side of the thin section 23 near the opening 21 is connected to
the guiding section 25, and an inner diameter of the guiding section 25 gradually
increases in a direction toward the opening 21.
      On the other hand, the hollow room 2 has a positioning clamp 3 for positioning
with the external pipe.    The positioning clamp 3 has a base 31 in ring shaped to
surround a channel 311.     A plurality of clamping blocks 32 is extending from one
side of the base 31.   The clamping blocks 32 surround the channel 311 of the base 31
and are arranged spacedly with each other by gaps 33.    Each of the clamping blocks
32 is are slightly deformable within the gap 33 between adjacent clamping blocks 32.
A reverse-tooth portion 321 is protruding from an inner side of each of the clamping
blocks 32 for stably engaging with the external pipe, and a protruding portion 322 is
on an outer side of each of the clamping blocks 32.     An outer diameter D1 of the
positioning clamp 3 is a distance between outer peripheries of the protruding portions
322 of two opposite clamping blocks 32, and the outer diameter D1 of the positioning
                                           4

clamp 3 is greater than the inner diameter D2 of the thin section 23.
      The positioning clamp 3 is engaged in the hollow room 2 from the opening 21.
In detail, in the operation, since the outer diameter D1 of the positioning clamp 3 is
greater than the inner diameter D2 of the thin section 23, the protruding portions 322
of the clamping blocks 32 are firstly put on the guiding section 25.        Next, during
placing the positioning clamp 3 in the hollow room 2, the clamping blocks 32 are
guided by the guiding section 25 so as to come close to each other, thus the outer
diameter D1 of the positioning clamp 3 is temporarily reduced to allow the positioning
clamp 3 to enter into the thin section 23.    Next, after the positioning clamp 3 passes
through the thin section 23 and enters into the expanded section 24, the positioning
clamp 3 is no more compressed by the thin section 23 and thus the clamping blocks
32 are resiliently recovered to the original positions.   At this moment, since the outer
diameter D1 of the positioning clamp 3 is again greater than the inner diameter D2 of
the thin section 23, the positioning clamp 3 is engaged in the hollow room 2.
      Accordingly, when an external pipe is connected to the bathroom quick coupling
according to the embodiment, as shown in Fig. 3, the external pipe 4 is inserted into
the hollow room 2 from the opening 21 and through the channel 311 of the base 31 of
the positioning clamp 3.      Then, the clamping blocks 32 are expanded outwardly in
the expanded section 24 by the external pipe 4, and the external pipe 4 is clamped by
the resilient force of the clamping blocks 32, so that the external pipe 4 is positioned.
Furthermore, the reverse-tooth portions 321 of the clamping blocks 32 can closely
engage with the external pipe 4 to generate a greater friction force.      Therefore, the
external pipe 4 can be stably connected to the connecting end 12 of the main body 1.
                                             5

     As above, the invention has fewer components, as compared with the
conventional.   Moreover, when a user tends to connect an external pipe 4 with the
coupling, the external pipe 4 is inserted into the connecting end 12 and the external
pipe 4 can be automatically engaged with the positioning clamp 3.      Therefore, the
user can perform the operation in an easy and convenient manner, facilitating the
assembling of the bathroom components.
