        ABSTRACT
        Photovoltaic devices such as solar cells, hybrid solar cell-batteries, and other such
devices may include an active layer disposed between two electrodes. The active layer
may have perovskite material and other material such as mesoporous material, interfacial
layers, thin-coat interfacial layers, and combinations thereof. The perovskite material
may be photoactive.     The perovskite material may be disposed between two or more
other materials in the photovoltaic device.       Inclusion of these materials in various
arrangements within an active layer of a photovoltaic device may improve device
performance. Other materials may be included to further improve device performance,
such as, for example: additional perovskites, and additional interfacial layers.

                                         BACKGROUND
        [0001] Use of photovoltaics (PVs) to generate electrical power from solar energy or
radiation may provide many benefits, including, for example, a power source, low or zero
emissions, power production independent of the power grid, durable physical structures (no
moving parts), stable and reliable systems, modular construction, relatively quick installation,
safe manufacture and use, and good public opinion and acceptance of use.
        [0002] The features and advantages of the present disclosure will be readily apparent to
those skilled in the art. While numerous changes may be made by those skilled in the art, such
changes are within the spirit of the invention.

               DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
         [0016] Improvements in various aspects of PV technologies compatible with organic,
non-organic, and/or hybrid PVs promise to further lower the cost of both organic PVs and other
PVs. For example, some solar cells, such as solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells, may take
advantage of novel cost-effective and high-stability alternative components, such as solid-state
charge transport materials (or, colloquially, "solid state electrolytes"). In addition, various kinds
of solar cells may advantageously include interfacial and other materials that may, among other
advantages, be more cost-effective and durable than conventional options currently in existence.
         [0017] The present disclosure relates generally to compositions of matter, apparatus and
methods of use of materials in photovoltaic cells in creating electrical energy from solar
radiation. More specifically, this disclosure relates to photoactive and other compositions of
matter, as well as apparatus, methods of use, and formation of such compositions of matter.
         [0018] Examples of these compositions of matter may include, for example, hole
transport materials, and/or materials that may be suitable for use as, e.g., interfacial layers (IFLs),
dyes, and/or other elements of PV devices. Such compounds may be deployed in a variety of PV
devices, such as heterojunction cells (e.g., bilayer and bulk), hybrid cells (e.g., organics with
CH 3NH 3PbI 3, ZnO nanorods or PbS quantum dots), and DSSCs (dye-sensitized solar cells). The
latter, DSSCs, exist in three forms: solvent-based electrolytes, ionic liquid electrolytes, and solid
state hole transporters (or solid-state DSSCs, i.e., SS-DSSCs). SS-DSSC structures according to
some embodiments may be substantially free of electrolyte, containing rather hole-transport
materials such as spiro-OMeTAD, CsSnI3, and other active materials.
                                                  2

        [0019] Some or all of materials in accordance with some embodiments of the present
disclosure may also advantageously be used in any organic or other electronic device, with some
examples including, but not limited to: batteries, field-effect transistors (FETs), light-emitting
diodes (LEDs), non-linear optical devices, memristors, capacitors, rectifiers, and/or rectifying
antennas.
        [0020] In some embodiments, the present disclosure may provide PV and other similar
devices (e.g., batteries, hybrid PV batteries, multi-junction PVs, FETs, LEDs etc.). Such devices
may in some embodiments include improved active material, interfacial layers, and/or one or
more perovskite materials. A perovskite material may be incorporated into various of one or
more aspects of a PV or other device. A perovskite material according to some embodiments
may be of the general formula CMX 3 , where: C comprises one or more cations (e.g., an amine,
ammonium, a Group 1 metal, a Group 2 metal, and/or other cations or cation-like compounds);
M comprises one or more metals (example s including Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Sn, Pb, Bi, Ge, Ti, and
Zr); and X comprises one or more anions.               Perovskite materials according to various
embodiments are discussed in greater detail below.
        [0021] Photovoltaic Cells and Other Electronic Devices
        [0022] Some PV embodiments may be described by reference to various illustrative
depictions of solar cells as shown in FIGs. 1, 3, 4, and 5. For example, an example PV
architecture according to some embodiments may be substantially of the form substrate-anode
IFL-active layer-IFL-cathode.       The active layer of some embodiments may be photoactive,
and/or it may include photoactive material. Other layers and materials may be utilized in the cell
as is known in the art. Furthermore, it should be noted that the use of the term "active layer" is
in no way meant to restrict or otherwise define, explicitly or implicitly, the properties of any
other layer -    for instance, in some embodiments, either or both IFLs may also be active insofar
as they may be semiconducting. In particular, referring to FIG. 4, a stylized generic PV cell
2610 is depicted, illustrating the highly interfacial nature of some layers within the PV. The PV
2610 represents a generic architecture applicable to several PV devices, such as perovskite
material PV embodiments.         The PV cell 2610 includes a transparent layer 2612 of glass (or
material similarly transparent to solar radiation) which allows solar radiation 2614 to transmit
through the layer. The transparent layer of some embodiments may also be referred to as a
substrate (e.g., as with substrate layer 1507 of FIG. 1), and it may comprise any one or more of a
                                                  3

variety of rigid or flexible materials such as: glass, polyethylene, PET, Kapton, quartz, aluminum
foil, gold foil, or steel. The photoactive layer 2616 is composed of electron donor or p-type
material 2618, and/or an electron acceptor or n-type material 2620, and/or an ambipolar
semiconductor, which exhibits both p- and n-type material characteristics. The active layer or, as
depicted in FIG. 4, the photo-active layer 2616, is sandwiched between two electrically
conductive electrode layers 2622 and 2624. In FIG. 4, the electrode layer 2622 is a tin-doped
indium oxide (ITO material). As previously noted, an active layer of some embodiments need
not necessarily be photoactive, although in the device shown in FIG. 4, it is. The electrode layer
2624 is an aluminum material.       Other materials may be used as is known in the art. The cell
2610 also includes an interfacial layer (IFL) 2626, shown in the example of FIG. 4 as a ZnO
material. The IFL may assist in charge separation. In some embodiments, the IFL 2626 may
comprise an organic compound according to the present disclosure as a self-assembled
monolayer (SAM) or as a thin film. In other embodiments, the IFL 2626 may comprise a multi
layer IFL, which is discussed in greater detail below. There also may be an IFL 2627 adjacent to
electrode 2624. In some embodiments, the IFL 2627 adjacent to electrode 2624 may also or
instead comprise an organic compound according to the present disclosure as a self-assembled
monolayer (SAM) or as a thin film. In other embodiments, the IFL 2627 adjacent to electrode
2624 may also or instead comprise a multi-layer IFL (again, discussed in greater detail below).
An IFL according to some embodiments may be semiconducting in character and may be either
p-type or n-type, or it may be dielectric in character.      In some embodiments, the IFL on the
cathode side of the device (e.g., IFL 2627 as shown in FIG. 4) may be p-type, and the IFL on the
anode side of the device (e.g., IFL 2626 as shown in FIG. 4) may be n-type.                 In other
embodiments, however, the cathode-side IFL may be n-type and the anode-side IFL may be p
type. The cell 2610 is attached to leads 2630 and a discharge unit 2632, such as a battery.
         [0023] Yet further embodiments may be described by reference to FIG. 3, which depicts
a stylized BHJ device design, and includes: glass substrate 2401; ITO (tin-doped indium oxide)
electrode 2402; interfacial layer (IFL) 2403; photoactive layer 2404; and LiF/Al cathodes 2405.
The materials of BHJ construction referred to are mere examples; any other BHJ construction
known in the art may be used consistent with the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the
photoactive layer 2404 may comprise any one or more materials that the active or photoactive
layer 2616 of the device of FIG. 4 may comprise.
                                                   4

         [0024] FIG. 1 is a simplified illustration of DSSC PVs according to some embodiments,
referred to here for purposes of illustrating assembly of such example PVs. An example DSSC
as shown in FIG. 1 may be constructed according to the following: electrode layer 1506 (shown
as fluorine-doped tin oxide, FTO) is deposited on a substrate layer 1507 (shown as glass).
Mesoporous layer ML 1505 (which may in some embodiments be TiO 2 ) is deposited onto the
electrode layer 1506, then the photoelectrode (so far comprising substrate layer 1507, electrode
layer 1506, and mesoporous layer 1505) is soaked in a solvent (not shown) and dye 1504. This
leaves the dye 1504 bound to the surface of the ML.          A separate counter-electrode is made
comprising substrate layer 1501 (also shown as glass) and electrode layer 1502 (shown as
Pt/FTO).     The photoelectrode and counter-electrode are combined, sandwiching the various
layers 1502 - 1506 between the two substrate layers 1501 and 1507 as shown in FIG. 1, and
allowing electrode layers 1502 and 1506 to be utilized as a cathode and anode, respectively. A
layer of electrolyte 1503 is deposited either directly onto the completed photoelectrode after dye
layer 1504 or through an opening in the device, typically a hole pre-drilled by sand-blasting in
the counter-electrode substrate 1501. The cell may also be attached to leads and a discharge unit,
such as a battery (not shown). Substrate layer 1507 and electrode layer 1506, and/or substrate
layer 1501 and electrode layer 1502 should be of sufficient transparency to permit solar radiation
to pass through to the photoactive dye 1504. In some embodiments, the counter-electrode and/or
photoelectrode may be rigid, while in others either or both may be flexible. The substrate layers
of various embodiments may comprise any one or more of: glass, polyethylene, PET, Kapton,
quartz, aluminum foil, gold foil, and steel. In certain embodiments, a DSSC may further include
a light harvesting layer 1601, as shown in FIG. 2, to scatter incident light in order to increase the
light's path length through the photoactive layer of the device (thereby increasing the likelihood
the light is absorbed in the photoactive layer).
         [0025] In other embodiments, the present disclosure provides solid state DSSCs. Solid
state DSSCs according to some embodiments may provide advantages such as lack of leakage
and/or corrosion issues that may affect DSSCs comprising liquid electrolytes.        Furthermore, a
solid-state charge carrier may provide faster device physics (e.g., faster charge transport).
Additionally, solid-state electrolytes may, in some embodiments, be photoactive and therefore
contribute to power derived from a solid-state DSSC device.
                                                   5

         [0026] Some examples of solid state DSSCs may be described by reference to FIG. 5,
which is a stylized schematic of a typical solid state DSSC.      As with the example solar cell
depicted in, e.g., FIG. 4, an active layer comprised of first and second active (e.g., conducting
and/or semi-conducting)     material (2810 and 2815, respectively) is sandwiched between
electrodes 2805 and 2820 (shown in FIG. 5 as Pt/FTO and FTO, respectively).                In the
embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the first active material 2810 is p-type active material, and
comprises a solid-state electrolyte. In certain embodiments, the first active material 2810 may
comprise an organic material such as spiro-OMeTAD and/or poly(3-hexylthiophene),               an
inorganic binary, ternary, quaternary, or greater complex, any solid semiconducting material, or
any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the first active material may additionally or
instead comprise an oxide and/or a sulfide, and/or a selenide, and/or an iodide (e.g., CsSnI3).
Thus, for example, the first active material of some embodiments may comprise solid-state p
type material, which may comprise copper indium sulfide, and in some embodiments, it may
comprise copper indium gallium selenide. The second active material 2815 shown in FIG. 5 is
n-type active material and comprises TiO 2 coated with a dye. In some embodiments, the second
active material may likewise comprise an organic material such as spiro-OMeTAD, an inorganic
binary, ternary, quaternary, or greater complex, or any combination thereof.             In some
embodiments, the second active material may comprise an oxide such as alumina, and/or it may
comprise a sulfide, and/or it may comprise a selenide. Thus, in some embodiments, the second
active material may comprise copper indium sulfide, and in some embodiments, it may comprise
copper indium gallium selenide metal. The second active material 2815 of some embodiments
may constitute a mesoporous layer. Furthermore, in addition to being active, either or both of
the first and second active materials 2810 and 2815 may be photoactive. In other embodiments
(not shown in FIG. 5), the second active material may comprise a solid electrolyte. In addition,
in embodiments where either of the first and second active material 2810 and 2815 comprise a
solid electrolyte, the PV device may lack an effective amount of liquid electrolyte. Although
shown and referred to in FIG. 5 as being p-type, a solid state layer (e.g., first active material
comprising solid electrolyte) may in some embodiments instead be n-type semiconducting. In
such embodiments, then, the second active material (e.g., TiO 2 (or other mesoporous material) as
shown in FIG. 5) coated with a dye may be p-type semiconducting (as opposed to the n-type
semiconducting shown in, and discussed with respect to, FIG. 5).
                                                 6

         [0027] Substrate layers 2801 and 2825 (both shown in FIG. 5 as glass) form the
respective external top and bottom layers of the example cell of FIG. 5. These layers may
comprise any material of sufficient transparency to permit solar radiation to pass through to the
active/photoactive layer comprising dye, first and second active and/or photoactive material 2810
and 2815, such as glass, polyethylene, PET, Kapton, quartz, aluminum foil, gold foil, and/or
steel. Furthermore, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, electrode 2805 (shown as Pt/FTO) is the
cathode, and electrode 2820 is the anode. As with the example solar cell depicted in FIG. 4,
solar radiation passes through substrate layer 2825 and electrode 2820 into the active layer,
whereupon at least a portion of the solar radiation is absorbed so as to produce one or more
excitons to enable electrical generation.
         [0028] A solid state DSSC according to some embodiments may be constructed in a
substantially similar manner to that described above with respect to the DSSC depicted as
stylized in FIG. 1. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, p-type active material 2810 corresponds
to electrolyte 1503 of FIG. 1; n-type active material 2815 corresponds to both dye 1504 and ML
1505 of FIG. 1; electrodes 2805 and 2820 respectively correspond to electrode layers 1502 and
1506 of FIG. 1; and substrate layers 2801 and 2825 respectively correspond to substrate layers
1501 and 1507.
         [0029] Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide improved materials and/or
designs in various aspects of solar cell and other devices, including among other things, active
materials (including hole-transport and/or electron-transport layers), interfacial layers, and
overall device design.
         [0030] Interfacial Layers
         [0031] The present disclosure, in some embodiments, provides advantageous materials
and designs of one or more interfacial layers within a PV, including thin-coat IFLs. Thin-coat
IFLs may be employed in one or more IFLs of a PV according to various embodiments discussed
herein.
         [0032] According to various embodiments, devices may optionally include an interfacial
layer between any two other layers and/or materials, although devices need not contain any
interfacial layers. For example, a perovskite material device may contain zero, one, two, three,
four, five, or more interfacial layers (such as the example device of FIG. 7, which contains five
interfacial layers 3903, 3905, 3907, 3909, and 3911).      An interfacial layer may include any
                                                  7

suitable material for enhancing charge transport and/or collection between two layers or
materials; it may also help prevent or reduce the likelihood of charge recombination once a
charge has been transported away from one of the materials adjacent to the interfacial layer. An
interfacial layer may additionally physically and electrically homogenize its substrates to create
variations in substrate roughness, dielectric constant, adhesion, creation or quenching of defects
(e.g., charge traps, surface states). Suitable interfacial materials may include any one or more of:
Al; Bi; Co; Cu; Fe; In; Mn; Mo; Ni; platinum (Pt); Si; Sn; Ta; Ti; V; W; Nb; Zn; Zr; oxides of
any of the foregoing metals (e.g., alumina, silica, titania); a sulfide of any of the foregoing
metals; a nitride of any of the foregoing metals; functionalized or non-functionalized alkyl silyl
groups; graphite; graphene; fullerenes; carbon nanotubes; any mesoporous material and/or
interfacial material discussed elsewhere herein; and combinations thereof (including, in some
embodiments, bilayers of combined materials). In some embodiments, an interfacial layer may
include perovskite material. Further, interfacial layers may comprise doped embodiments of any
interfacial  material mentioned herein (e.g.,         Y-doped ZnO, N-doped single-wall carbon
nanotubes).
         [0033] First, as previously noted, one or more IFLs (e.g., either or both IFLs 2626 and
2627 as shown in FIG. 4) may comprise a photoactive organic compound of the present
disclosure as a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) or as a thin film. When a photoactive organic
compound of the present disclosure is applied as a SAM, it may comprise a binding group
through which it may be covalently or otherwise bound to the surface of either or both of the
anode and cathode. The binding group of some embodiments may comprise any one or more of
COOH, SiX 3 (where X may be any moiety suitable for forming a ternary silicon compound, such
as Si(OR) 3 and SiCl3 ), S03, PO 4 H, OH, CH 2 X (where X may comprise a Group 17 halide), and
0. The binding group may be covalently or otherwise bound to an electron-withdrawing moiety,
an electron donor moiety, and/or a core moiety. The binding group may attach to the electrode
surface in a manner so as to form a directional, organized layer of a single molecule (or, in some
embodiments, multiple molecules) in thickness (e.g., where multiple photoactive organic
compounds are bound to the anode and/or cathode). As noted, the SAM may attach via covalent
interactions, but in some embodiments it may attach via ionic, hydrogen-bonding, and/or
dispersion force (i,e., Van Der Waals) interactions. Furthermore, in certain embodiments, upon
light exposure, the SAM may enter into a zwitterionic excited state, thereby creating a highly
                                                    8

polarized IFL, which may direct charge carriers from an active layer into an electrode (e.g.,
either the anode or cathode). This enhanced charge-carrier injection may, in some embodiments,
be accomplished by electronically poling the cross-section of the active layer and therefore
increasing charge-carrier drift velocities towards their respective electrode (e.g., hole to anode;
electrons to cathode).    Molecules for anode applications of some embodiments may comprise
tunable compounds that include a primary electron donor moiety bound to a core moiety, which
in turn is bound to an electron-withdrawing moiety, which in turn is bound to a binding group.
In cathode applications according to some embodiments, IFL molecules may comprise a tunable
compound comprising an electron poor moiety bound to a core moiety, which in turn is bound to
an electron donor moiety, which in turn is bound to a binding group.           When a photoactive
organic compound is employed as an IFL according to such embodiments, it may retain
photoactive character, although in some embodiments it need not be photoactive.
         [0034] In addition or instead of a photoactive organic compound SAM IFL, a PV
according to some embodiments may include a thin interfacial layer (a "thin-coat interfacial
layer" or "thin-coat IFL") coated onto at least a portion of either the first or the second active
material of such embodiments (e.g., first or second active material 2810 or 2815 as shown in
FIG. 5). And, in turn, at least a portion of the thin-coat IFL may be coated with a dye. The thin
coat IFL may be either n- or p-type; in some embodiments, it may be of the same type as the
underlying material (e.g., TiO 2 or other mesoporous material, such as TiO 2 of second active
material 2815).    The second active material may comprise TiO 2 coated with a thin-coat IFL
comprising alumina (e.g., A12 0 3 ) (not shown in FIG. 5), which in turn is coated with a dye.
References herein to TiO 2 and/or titania are not intended to limit the ratios of tin and oxide in
such tin-oxide compounds described herein. That is, a titania compound may comprise titanium
in any one or more of its various oxidation states (e.g., titanium I, titanium II, titanium III,
titanium IV), and thus various          embodiments may include        stoichiometric  and/or non
stoichiometric amounts of titanium and oxide. Thus, various embodiments may include (instead
or in addition to TiO 2 ) TixOy, where x may be any value, integer or non-integer, between 1 and
100. In some embodiments, x may be between approximately 0.5 and 3. Likewise, y may be
between approximately 1.5 and 4 (and, again, need not be an integer). Thus, some embodiments
may include, e.g., TiO 2 and/or Ti 2 0 3. In addition, titania in whatever ratios or combination of
                                                   9

ratios between titanium and oxide may be of any one or more crystal structures in some
embodiments, including any one or more of anatase, rutile, and amorphous.
        [0035] Other example metal oxides for use in the thin-coat IFL of some embodiments
may include semiconducting metal oxides, such as NiO, WO3, V20 5 , or MoO3. The embodiment
wherein the second (e.g., n-type) active material comprises TiO 2 coated with a thin-coat IFL
comprising A12 0 3 could be formed, for example, with a precursor material such as
Al(NO 3) 3-xH 2 0, or any other material suitable for depositing A12 0 3 onto the TiO 2 , followed by
thermal annealing and dye coating. In example embodiments wherein a MoO3 coating is instead
used, the coating may be formed with a precursor material such as Na2Mo 4 -2H2O; whereas a
V20  5 coating according to some embodiments may be formed with a precursor material such as
NaVO3; and a W0 3 coating according to some embodiments may be formed with a precursor
material such as NaWO 4 -H20. The concentration of precursor material (e.g., Al(NO3)3.xH20)
may affect the final film thickness (here, of A12 0 3 ) deposited on the TiO 2 or other active
material. Thus, modifying the concentration of precursor material may be a method by which
the final film thickness may be controlled. For example, greater film thickness may result from
greater precursor material concentration. Greater film thickness may not necessarily result in
greater PCE in a PV device comprising a metal oxide coating.              Thus, a method of some
embodiments may include coating a TiO 2 (or other mesoporous) layer using a precursor material
having a concentration in the range of approximately 0.5 to 10.0 mM; other embodiments may
include coating the layer with a precursor material having a concentration in the range of
approximately 2.0 to 6.0 mM; or, in other embodiments, approximately 2.5 to 5.5 mM.
        [0036] Furthermore, although referred to herein as A12 0 3 and/or alumina, it should be
noted that various ratios of aluminum and oxygen may be used in forming alumina. Thus,
although some embodiments discussed herein are described with reference to A12 0 3 , such
description is not intended to define a required ratio of aluminum in oxygen.                  Rather,
embodiments may include any one or more aluminum-oxide compounds, each having an
aluminum oxide ratio according to AlxOy, where x may be any value, integer or non-integer,
between approximately 1 and 100. In some embodiments, x may be between approximately 1
and 3 (and, again, need not be an integer). Likewise, y may be any value, integer or non-integer,
between 0.1 and 100. In some embodiments, y may be between 2 and 4 (and, again, need not be
                                                 10

an integer).   In addition, various crystalline forms of AlxOy may be present in various
embodiments, such as alpha, gamma, and/or amorphous forms of alumina.
        [0037] Likewise, although referred to herein as MoO3, W03, and V20 5 , such compounds
may instead or in addition be represented as MoxOy, WxOy, and VxOy, respectively. Regarding
each of MoxOy and WxOy, x may be any value, integer or non-integer, between approximately 0.5
and 100; in some embodiments, it may be between approximately 0.5 and 1.5. Likewise, y may
be any value, integer or non-integer, between approximately 1 and 100. In some embodiments, y
may be any value between approximately 1 and 4. Regarding VxOy, x may be any value, integer
or non-integer, between approximately 0.5 and 100; in some embodiments, it may be between
approximately 0.5 and 1.5.       Likewise, y may be any value, integer or non-integer, between
approximately 1 and 100; in certain embodiments, it may be an integer or non-integer value
between approximately 1 and 10.
        [0038] Similarly, references in some illustrative embodiments herein to CsSnI3 are not
intended to limit the ratios of component elements in the cesium-tin-iodine compounds according
to various embodiments.          Some embodiments may include stoichiometric and/or non
stoichiometric amounts of tin and iodide, and thus such embodiments may instead or in addition
include various ratios of cesium, tin, and iodine, such as any one or more cesium-tin-iodine
compounds, each having a ratio of CsxSnyIz. In such embodiments, x may be any value, integer
or non-integer, between 0.1 and 100. In some embodiments, x may be between approximately
0.5 and 1.5 (and, again, need not be an integer). Likewise, y may be any value, integer or non
integer, between 0.1 and 100. In some embodiments, y may be between approximately 0.5 and
1.5 (and, again, need not be an integer). Likewise, z may be any value, integer or non-integer,
between 0.1 and 100.       In some embodiments, z may be between approximately 2.5 and 3.5.
Additionally CsSnI3 may be doped or compounded with other materials, such as SnF2, in ratios
of CsSnI3:SnF2 ranging from 0.1:1 to 100:1, including all values (integer and non-integer) in
between.
        [0039] In addition, a thin-coat IFL may comprise a bilayer.        Thus, returning to the
example wherein the thin-coat IFL comprises a metal-oxide (such as alumina), the thin-coat IFL
may comprise TiO2-plus-metal-oxide. Such a thin-coat IFL may have a greater ability to resist
charge recombination as compared to mesoporous TiO 2 or other active material alone.
Furthermore, in forming a TiO 2 layer, a secondary TiO 2 coating is often necessary in order to
                                                11

provide sufficient physical interconnection of TiO 2 particles, according to some embodiments of
the present disclosure.      Coating a bilayer thin-coat IFL onto mesoporous TiO 2 (or other
mesoporous active material) may comprise a combination of coating using a compound
comprising both metal oxide and TiCl 4, resulting in an bilayer thin-coat IFL comprising a
combination of metal-oxide and secondary TiO 2 coating, which may provide performance
improvements over use of either material on its own.
         [0040] In some embodiments, the IFL may comprise a titanate. A titanate according to
some embodiments may be of the general formula M'TiO 3 , where: M' comprises any 2+ cation.
In some embodiments, M' may comprise a cationic form of Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ni, Zn, Cd, Hg,
Cu, Pd, Pt, Sn, or Pb. In some embodiments, the IFL may comprise a single species of titanate,
which in other embodiments, the IFL may comprise two or more different species of titanates. In
one embodiment, the titanate has the formula SrTiO3. In another embodiment, the titanate may
have the formula BaTiO3.         In yet another embodiment, the titanate may have the formula
CaTiO3.
         [0041] By way of explanation, and without implying any limitation, titanates have a
perovskite crystalline structure and strongly seed the MAPbI 3 growth conversion process.
Titanates generally also meet other IFL requirements, such as ferroelectric behavior, sufficient
charge carrier mobility, optical transparency, matched energy levels, and high dielectric constant.
         [0042] Any    interfacial  material   discussed  herein  may    further comprise    doped
compositions.     To modify the characteristics (e.g., electrical, optical, mechanical) of an
interfacial material, a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric material may be doped with one or
more elements (e.g., Na, Y, Mg, N, P) in amounts ranging from as little as 1 ppb to 50 mol%.
Some examples of interfacial materials include: NiO, TiO 2 , SrTiO3, A12 0 3 , ZrO2, W03, V20 5 ,
MO 3 , ZnO, graphene, and carbon black. Examples of possible dopants for these interfacial
materials include: Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, Nb, Ti, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ga, Sn, In, B, N, P, C, S,
As, a halide, a pseudohalide (e.g., cyanide, cyanate, isocyanate, fulminate, thiocyanate,
isothiocyanate,          azide,        tetracarbonylcobaltate,        carbamoyldicyanomethanide,
dicyanonitrosomethanide, dicyanamide, and tricyanomethanide), and Al in any of its oxidation
states.   References herein to doped interfacial materials are not intended to limit the ratios of
component elements in interfacial material compounds.

        [0043] FIG. 10 is a stylized diagram of a perovskite material device 4400 according to
some embodiments. Although various components of the device 4400 are illustrated as discrete
layers comprising contiguous material, it should be understood that FIG. 10 is a stylized
diagram; thus, embodiments in accordance with it may include such discrete layers, and/or
substantially intermixed, non-contiguous layers, consistent with the usage of "layers" previously
discussed herein. The device 4400 includes first and second substrates 4401 and 4407. A first
electrode (ITO) 4402 is disposed upon an inner surface of the first substrate 4401, and a second
electrode (Ag) 4406 is disposed on an inner surface of the second substrate 4407. An active
layer 4450 is sandwiched between the two electrodes 4402 and 4406. The active layer 4450
includes a first IFL (e.g., SrTiO3) 4403, a photoactive material (e.g., MAPbI 3) 4404, and a charge
transport layer (e.g., Spiro-OMeTAD) 4405.
        [0044] The thin-coat IFLs and methods of coating them onto TiO 2 previously discussed
may, in some embodiments, be employed in DSSCs comprising liquid electrolytes.                Thus,
returning to the example of a thin-coat IFL and referring back to FIG. 1 for an example, the
DSSC of FIG. 1 could further comprise a thin-coat IFL as described above coated onto the
mesoporous layer 1505 (that is, the thin-coat IFL would be inserted between mesoporous layer
1505 and dye 1504).
        [0045] In one embodiment, a perovskite material device may be formulated by casting
PbI 2 onto a SrTiO3-coated ITO substrate. The may PbI 2 be converted to MAPbI 3 by a dipping
process.   This process is described in greater detail below. This conversion process is more
complete (as observed by optical spectroscopy) as compared to the preparation of the substrate
without SrTiO3.
        [0046] In some embodiments, the thin-coat IFLs previously discussed in the context of
DSSCs may be used in any interfacial layer of a semiconductor device such as a PV (e.g., a
hybrid PV or other PV), field-effect transistor, light-emitting diode, non-linear optical device,
memristor, capacitor, rectifier, rectifying antenna, etc.   Furthermore, thin-coat IFLs of some
embodiments may be employed in any of various devices in combination with other compounds
discussed in the present disclosure, including but not limited to any one or more of the following
of various embodiments of the present disclosure: solid hole-transport material such as active
material and additives (such as, in some embodiments, chenodeoxycholic                acid or 1,8
diiodooctane).
                                                 13

         [0047] In some embodiments, multiple IFLs made from different materials may be
arranged adjacent to each other to form a composite IFL. This configuration may involve two
different IFLs, three different IFLs, or an even greater number of different IFLs. The resulting
multi-layer IFL or composite IFL may be used in lieu of a single-material IFL. For example, a
composite IFL may be used as IFL 2626 and/or as IFL 2627 in cell 2610, shown in the example
of FIG. 4.    While the composite IFL differs from a single-material IFL, the assembly of a
perovskite material PV cell having multi-layer IFLs is not substantially different than the
assembly of a perovskite material PV cell having only single-material IFLs.
         [0048] Generally, the composite IFL may be made using any of the materials discussed
herein as suitable for an IFL. In one embodiment, the IFL comprises a layer of A12 0 3 and a layer
of ZnO or M:ZnO (doped ZnO, e.g., Be:ZnO, Mg:ZnO, Ca:ZnO, Sr:ZnO, Ba:ZnO, Sc:ZnO,
Y:ZnO, Nb:ZnO). In an embodiment, the IFL comprises a layer of ZrO2 and a layer of ZnO or
M:ZnO. In certain embodiments, the IFL comprises multiple layers. In some embodiments, a
multi-layer IFL generally has a conductor layer, a dielectric layer, and a semi-conductor layer.
In particular embodiments the layers may repeat, for example, a conductor layer, a dielectric
layer, a semi-conductor layer, a dielectric layer, and a semi-conductor layer. Examples of multi
layer IFLs include an IFL having an ITO layer, an A120         3 layer, a ZnO layer, and a second A12 0 3
layer; an IFL having an ITO layer, an A120       3   layer, a ZnO layer, a second A120      3 layer, and a
second ZnO layer; an IFL having an ITO layer, an A120             3 layer, a ZnO layer, a second A12 0 3
layer, a second ZnO layer, and a third A120   3 layer; and IFLs having as many layers as necessary
to achieve the desired performance characteristics. As discussed previously, references to certain
stoichiometric ratios are not intended to limit the ratios of component elements in IFL layers
according to various embodiments.
         [0049] Arranging two or more adjacent IFLs as a composite IFL may outperform a single
IFL in perovskite material PV cells where attributes from each IFL material may be leveraged in
a single IFL. For example, in the architecture having an ITO layer, an A120           3 layer, and a ZnO
layer, where ITO is a conducting electrode, A120         3 is a dielectric material and ZnO is a n-type
semiconductor, ZnO acts as an electron acceptor with well performing electron transport
properties (e.g., mobility). Additionally, A120    3  is a physically robust material that adheres well
to ITO, homogenizes the surface by capping surface defects (e.g., charge traps), and improves
device diode characteristics through suppression of dark current.

        [0050] FIG. 11 is a stylized diagram of a perovskite material device 4500 according to
some embodiments. Although various components of the device 4500 are illustrated as discrete
layers comprising contiguous material, it should be understood that FIG. 11 is a stylized
diagram; thus, embodiments in accordance with it may include such discrete layers, and/or
substantially intermixed, non-contiguous layers, consistent with the usage of "layers" previously
discussed herein. The device 4500 includes first and second substrates 4501 and 4508. A first
electrode (e.g., ITO) 4502 is disposed upon an inner surface of the first substrate 4501, and a
second electrode (e.g., Ag) 4507 is disposed on an inner surface of the second substrate 4508.
An active layer 4550 is sandwiched between the two electrodes 4502 and 4507. The active layer
4550 includes a composite IFL comprising a first IFL (e.g., A120 3 ) 4503 and a second IFL (e.g.,
ZnO) 4504, a photoactive material (e.g., MAPbI 3) 4505, and a charge transport layer (e.g., Spiro
OMeTAD) 4506.
        [0051] FIGS. 13-20 are stylized diagrams of perovskite material devices according to
some embodiments.      Although various components of the devices are illustrated as discrete
layers comprising contiguous material, it should be understood that FIGS. 13-18 are stylized
diagrams; thus, embodiments in accordance with them may include such discrete layers, and/or
substantially intermixed, non-contiguous layers, consistent with the usage of "layers" previously
discussed herein. The example devices include layers and materials described throughout this
disclosure. The devices may include a substrate layer (e.g., glass), electrode layers (e.g., ITO,
Ag), interfacial layers, which may be composite IFLs (e.g., ZnO, A120 3 , Y:ZnO, and/or
Nb:ZnO), a photoactive material (e.g. MAPbI 3 , FAPbI3 , 5-AVA-HCl: MAPbI3, and/or CHP:
MAPbI 3), and a charge transport layer (e.g., Spiro-OMeTAD, PCDTBT, TFB, TPD, PTB7,
F8BT, PPV, MDMO-PPV, MEH-PPV, and/or P3HT).

IFL (e.g., A12 0 3 ) 6103 and a second IFL (e.g., ZnO) 6104, a photoactive material (e.g., MAPbI 3)
6105, and a charge transport layer (e.g., Spiro-OMeTAD) 6106.
         [0053] FIG. 14 is a stylized diagram of a perovskite material device 6200 according to
some embodiments. Although various components of the device 6200 are illustrated as discrete
layers comprising contiguous material, it should be understood that FIG. 14 is a stylized
diagram; thus, embodiments in accordance with it may include such discrete layers, and/or
substantially intermixed, non-contiguous layers, consistent with the usage of "layers" previously

embodiments include CsSnI3 (previously discussed herein) and CsxSnyIz (with x, y, and z varying
in accordance with the previous discussion). Other examples include compounds of the general

        [0071] Composite Perovskite Material Device Design
        [0072] In some embodiments, the present disclosure may provide composite design of
PV and other similar devices (e.g., batteries, hybrid PV batteries, FETs, LEDs etc.) including one
or more perovskite materials. For example, one or more perovskite materials may serve as either
or both of first and second active material of some embodiments (e.g., active materials 2810 and
2815 of FIG. 5). In more general terms, some embodiments of the present disclosure provide PV
or other devices having an active layer comprising one or more perovskite materials. In such
embodiments, perovskite material (that is, material including any one or more perovskite
materials(s)) may be employed in active layers of various architectures. Furthermore, perovskite
material may serve the function(s) of any one or more components of an active layer (e.g.,
charge transport material, mesoporous material, photoactive material, and/or interfacial material,
each of which is discussed in greater detail below). In some embodiments, the same perovskite
materials may serve multiple such functions, although in other embodiments, a plurality of
perovskite materials may be included in a device, each perovskite material serving one or more
such functions. In certain embodiments, whatever role a perovskite material may serve, it may
be prepared and/or present in a device in various states. For example, it may be substantially
solid in some embodiments.        In other embodiments, it may be a solution (e.g., perovskite
material may be dissolved in liquid and present in said liquid in its individual ionic subspecies);
or it may be a suspension (e.g., of perovskite material particles). A solution or suspension may
be coated or otherwise deposited within a device (e.g., on another component of the device such
as a mesoporous, interfacial, charge transport, photoactive, or other layer, and/or on an
electrode).  Perovskite materials in some embodiments may be formed in situ on a surface of
another component of a device (e.g., by vapor deposition as a thin-film solid).          Any other
suitable means of forming a solid or liquid layer comprising perovskite material may be
employed.
                                                 27

         [0073] In general, a perovskite material device may include a first electrode, a second
electrode, and an active layer comprising a perovskite material, the active layer disposed at least
partially between the first and second electrodes. In some embodiments, the first electrode may
be one of an anode and a cathode, and the second electrode may be the other of an anode and
cathode. An active layer according to certain embodiments may include any one or more active
layer components, including any one or more of: charge transport material; liquid electrolyte;
mesoporous material; photoactive material (e.g., a dye, silicon, cadmium telluride, cadmium
sulfide, cadmium selenide, copper indium gallium selenide, gallium arsenide, germanium indium
phosphide, semiconducting polymers, other photoactive materials)); and interfacial material.
Any one or more of these active layer components may include one or more perovskite materials.
In some embodiments, some or all of the active layer components may be in whole or in part
arranged in sub-layers.    For example, the active layer may comprise any one or more of: an
interfacial layer including interfacial material; a mesoporous layer including mesoporous
material;   and a charge transport layer including charge transport material.            In some
embodiments, photoactive material such as a dye may be coated on, or otherwise disposed on,
any one or more of these layers. In certain embodiments, any one or more layers may be coated
with a liquid electrolyte. Further, an interfacial layer may be included between any two or more
other layers of an active layer according to some embodiments, and/or between a layer and a
coating (such as between a dye and a mesoporous layer), and/or between two coatings (such as
between a liquid electrolyte and a dye), and/or between an active layer component and an
electrode. Reference to layers herein may include either a final arrangement (e.g., substantially
discrete portions of each material separately definable within the device), and/or reference to a
layer may mean arrangement during construction of a device, notwithstanding the possibility of
subsequent intermixing of material(s) in each layer.       Layers may in some embodiments be
discrete and comprise substantially contiguous material (e.g., layers may be as stylistically
illustrated in FIG. 1). In other embodiments, layers may be substantially intermixed (as in the
case of, e.g., BHJ, hybrid, and some DSSC cells), an example of which is shown by first and
second active material 2618 and 2620 within photoactive layer 2616 in FIG. 4.             In some
embodiments, a device may comprise a mixture of these two kinds of layers, as is also shown by
the device of FIG. 4, which contains discrete contiguous layers 2627, 2626, and 2622, in addition
to a photoactive layer 2616 comprising intermixed layers of first and second active material 2618
                                                  28

and 2620. In any case, any two or more layers of whatever kind may in certain embodiments be
disposed adjacent to each other (and/or intermixedly with each other) in such a way as to achieve
a high contact surface area. In certain embodiments, a layer comprising perovskite material may
be disposed adjacent to one or more other layers so as to achieve high contact surface area (e.g.,
where a perovskite material exhibits low charge mobility). In other embodiments, high contact
surface area may not be necessary (e.g., where a perovskite material exhibits high charge
mobility).
        [0074] A perovskite material device according to some embodiments may optionally
include one or more substrates.      In some embodiments, either or both of the first and second
electrode may be coated or otherwise disposed upon a substrate, such that the electrode is
disposed substantially between a substrate and the active layer. The materials of composition of
devices (e.g., substrate, electrode, active layer and/or active layer components) may in whole or
in part be either rigid or flexible in various embodiments. In some embodiments, an electrode
may act as a substrate, thereby negating the need for a separate substrate.
        [0075] Furthermore, a perovskite material device according to certain embodiments may
optionally include light-harvesting material (e.g., in a light-harvesting layer, such as Light
Harvesting Layer 1601 as depicted in the example PV represented in FIG. 2).         In addition, a
perovskite material device may include any one or more additives, such as any one or more of
the additives discussed above with respect to some embodiments of the present disclosure.
        [0076] Description of some of the various materials that may be included in a perovskite
material device will be made in part with reference to FIG. 7. FIG. 7 is a stylized diagram of a
perovskite material device 3900 according to some embodiments. Although various components
of the device 3900 are illustrated as discrete layers comprising contiguous material, it should be
understood that FIG. 7 is a stylized diagram; thus, embodiments in accordance with it may
include such discrete layers, and/or substantially intermixed, non-contiguous layers, consistent
with the usage of "layers" previously discussed herein.        The device 3900 includes first and
second substrates 3901 and 3913. A first electrode 3902 is disposed upon an inner surface of the
first substrate 3901, and a second electrode 3912 is disposed on an inner surface of the second
substrate 3913. An active layer 3950 is sandwiched between the two electrodes 3902 and 3912.
The active layer 3950 includes a mesoporous layer 3904; first and second photoactive materials
3906 and 3908; a charge transport layer 3910, and several interfacial layers. FIG. 7 furthermore
                                                  29

illustrates an example device 3900 according to embodiments wherein sub-layers of the active
layer 3950 are separated by the interfacial layers, and further wherein interfacial layers are
disposed upon each electrode 3902 and 3912. In particular, second, third, and fourth interfacial
layers 3905, 3907, and 3909 are respectively disposed between each of the mesoporous layer
3904, first photoactive material 3906, second photoactive material 3908, and charge transport
layer 3910. First and fifth interfacial layers 3903 and 3911 are respectively disposed between (i)
the first electrode 3902 and mesoporous layer 3904; and (ii) the charge transport layer 3910 and
second electrode 3912. Thus, the architecture of the example device depicted in FIG. 7 may be
characterized as: substrate-electrode-active layer-electrode-substrate.        The architecture of
the active layer 3950 may be characterized as: interfacial layer-mesoporous layer-interfacial
layer-photoactive material-interfacial layer-photoactive material-interfacial layer-charge
transport layer-interfacial layer. As noted previously, in some embodiments, interfacial layers
need not be present; or, one or more interfacial layers may be included only between certain, but
not all, components of an active layer and/or components of a device.
         [0077] A substrate, such as either or both of first and second substrates 3901 and 3913,
may be flexible or rigid. If two substrates are included, at least one should be transparent or
translucent to electromagnetic (EM) radiation (such as, e.g., UV, visible, or IR radiation). If one
substrate is included, it may be similarly transparent or translucent, although it need not be, so
long as a portion of the device permits EM radiation to contact the active layer 3950. Suitable
substrate materials include any one or more of: glass; sapphire; magnesium oxide (MgO); mica;
polymers (e.g., PET, PEG, polypropylene, polyethylene, etc.); ceramics; fabrics (e.g., cotton,
silk, wool); wood; drywall; metal; and combinations thereof.
         [0078] As previously noted, an electrode (e.g., one of electrodes 3902 and 3912 of FIG.
7) may be either an anode or a cathode. In some embodiments, one electrode may function as a
cathode, and the other may function as an anode. Either or both electrodes 3902 and 3912 may
be coupled to leads, cables, wires, or other means enabling charge transport to and/or from the
device 3900. An electrode may constitute any conductive material, and at least one electrode
should be transparent or translucent to EM radiation, and/or be arranged in a manner that allows
EM radiation to contact at least a portion of the active layer 3950. Suitable electrode materials
may include any one or more of: indium tin oxide or tin-doped indium oxide (ITO); fluorine
doped tin oxide (FTO); cadmium oxide (CdO); zinc indium tin oxide (ZITO); aluminum zinc
                                                 30

oxide (AZO); aluminum (Al); gold (Au); calcium (Ca); magnesium (Mg); titanium (Ti); steel;
carbon (and allotropes thereof); and combinations thereof.
        [0079] Mesoporous material (e.g., the material included in mesoporous layer 3904 of
FIG. 7) may include any pore-containing material. In some embodiments, the pores may have
diameters ranging from about 1 to about 100 nm; in other embodiments, pore diameter may
range from about 2 to about 50 nm. Suitable mesoporous material includes any one or more of:
any interfacial material and/or mesoporous material discussed elsewhere herein; aluminum (Al);
bismuth (Bi); indium (In); molybdenum (Mo); niobium (Nb); nickel (Ni); silicon (Si); titanium
(Ti); vanadium (V); zinc (Zn); zirconium (Zr); an oxide of any one or more of the foregoing
metals (e.g., alumina, ceria, titania, zinc oxide, zircona, etc.); a sulfide of any one or more of the
foregoing metals; a nitride of any one or more of the foregoing metals; and combinations thereof.
        [0080] Photoactive material (e.g., first or second photoactive material 3906 or 3908 of
FIG. 7) may comprise any photoactive compound, such as any one or more of silicon (in some
instances, single-crystalline silicon), cadmium telluride, cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide,
copper indium gallium selenide, gallium arsenide, germanium indium phosphide, one or more
semiconducting polymers, and combinations thereof.             In certain embodiments, photoactive
material may instead or in addition comprise a dye (e.g., N719, N3, other ruthenium-based dyes).
In some embodiments, a dye (of whatever composition) may be coated onto another layer (e.g., a
mesoporous layer and/or an interfacial layer). In some embodiments, photoactive material may
include one or more perovskite materials. Perovskite-material-containing photoactive substance
may be of a solid form, or in some embodiments it may take the form of a dye that includes a
suspension or solution comprising perovskite material. Such a solution or suspension may be
coated onto other device components in a manner similar to other dyes. In some embodiments,
solid perovskite-containing material may be deposited by any suitable means (e.g., vapor
deposition, solution deposition, direct placement of solid material, etc.). Devices according to
various embodiments may include one, two, three, or more photoactive compounds (e.g., one,
two, three, or more perovskite materials, dyes, or combinations thereof). In certain embodiments
including multiple dyes or other photoactive materials, each of the two or more dyes or other
photoactive materials may be separated by one or more interfacial layers. In some embodiments,
multiple dyes and/or photoactive compounds may be at least in part intermixed.
                                                   31

         [0081] Charge transport material (e.g., charge transport material of charge transport layer
3910 in FIG. 7) may include solid-state charge transport material (i.e., a colloquially labeled
solid-state electrolyte), or it may include a liquid electrolyte and/or ionic liquid.     Any of the
liquid electrolyte, ionic liquid, and solid-state charge transport material may be referred to as
charge transport material.     As used herein, "charge transport material" refers to any material,
solid, liquid, or otherwise, capable of collecting charge carriers and/or transporting charge
carriers.   For instance, in PV devices according to some embodiments, a charge transport
material may be capable of transporting charge carriers to an electrode.         Charge carriers may
include holes (the transport of which could make the charge transport material just as properly
labeled "hole transport material") and electrons. Holes may be transported toward an anode, and
electrons toward a cathode, depending upon placement of the charge transport material in
relation to either a cathode or anode in a PV or other device.          Suitable examples of charge
transport material according to some embodiments may include any one or more of: perovskite
material; I-/I3-; Co complexes; polythiophenes (e.g., poly(3-hexylthiophene) and derivatives
thereof,    or   P3HT);    carbazole-based    copolymers    such     as   polyheptadecanylcarbazole
dithienylbenzothiadiazole and derivatives thereof (e.g.,PCDTBT); other copolymers such as
polycyclopentadithiophene-benzothiadiazole         and   derivatives    thereof   (e.g., PCPDTBT),
polybenzodithiophenyl-thienothiophenediyl and derivatives thereof (e.g., PTB6, PTB7, PTB7-th,
PCE-10); poly(triaryl amine) compounds and derivatives thereof (e.g., PTAA); Spiro-OMeTAD;
polyphenylene vinylenes and derivatives thereof (e.g, MDMO-PPV, MEH-PPV); fullerenes
and/or fullerene derivatives (e.g.,     C60, PCBM); and combinations thereof.             In certain
embodiments, charge transport material may include any material, solid or liquid, capable of
collecting charge carriers (electrons or holes), and/or capable of transporting charge carriers.
Charge transport material of some embodiments therefore may be n- or p-type active and/or
semi-conducting material. Charge transport material may be disposed proximate to one of the
electrodes of a device.     It may in some embodiments be disposed adjacent to an electrode,
although in other embodiments an interfacial layer may be disposed between the charge transport
material and an electrode (as shown, e.g., in FIG. 7 with the fifth interfacial layer 3911). In
certain embodiments, the type of charge transport material may be selected based upon the
electrode to which it is proximate. For example, if the charge transport material collects and/or
transports holes, it may be proximate to an anode so as to transport holes to the anode. However,
                                                 32

the charge transport material may instead be placed proximate to a cathode, and be selected or
constructed so as to transport electrons to the cathode.
         [0082] As previously noted, devices according to various embodiments may optionally
include an interfacial layer between any two other layers and/or materials, although devices
according to some embodiments need not contain any interfacial layers. Thus, for example, a
perovskite material device may contain zero, one, two, three, four, five, or more interfacial layers
(such as the example device of FIG. 7, which contains five interfacial layers 3903, 3905, 3907,
3909, and 3911). An interfacial layer may include a thin-coat interfacial layer in accordance
with embodiments previously discussed herein (e.g., comprising alumina and/or other metal
oxide particles, and/or a titania/metal-oxide bilayer, and/or other compounds in accordance with
thin-coat interfacial layers as discussed elsewhere herein). An interfacial layer according to some
embodiments may include any suitable material for enhancing charge transport and/or collection
between two layers or materials; it may also help prevent or reduce the likelihood of charge
recombination once a charge has been transported away from one of the materials adjacent to the
interfacial layer. Suitable interfacial materials may include any one or more of: any mesoporous
material and/or interfacial material discussed elsewhere herein; Al; Bi; Co; Cu; Fe; In; Mn; Mo;
Ni; platinum (Pt); Si; Sn; Ta; Ti; V; W; Nb; Zn; Zr; oxides of any of the foregoing metals (e.g.,
alumina, silica, titania); a sulfide of any of the foregoing metals; a nitride of any of the foregoing
metals; functionalized or non-functionalized alkyl silyl groups; graphite; graphene; fullerenes;
carbon nanotubes; and combinations thereof (including, in some embodiments, bilayers of
combined materials).       In some embodiments, an interfacial layer may include perovskite
material.
         [0083] A device according to the stylized representation of FIG. 7 may in some
embodiments be a PV, such as a DSSC, BHJ, or hybrid solar cell. In some embodiments,
devices according to FIG. 7 may constitute parallel or serial multi-cell PVs, batteries, hybrid PV
batteries, FETs, LEDS, and/or any other device discussed herein. For example, a BHJ of some
embodiments may include two electrodes corresponding to electrodes 3902 and 3912, and an
active layer comprising at least two materials in a heterojunction interface (e.g., any two of the
materials and/or layers of active layer 3950). In certain embodiments, other devices (such as
hybrid PV batteries, parallel or serial multi-cell PVs, etc.) may comprise an active layer
including a perovskite material, corresponding to active layer 3950 of FIG. 7. In short, the
                                                    33

stylized nature of the depiction of the example device of FIG. 7 should in no way limit the
permissible structure or architecture of devices of various embodiments in accordance with FIG.
7.
        [0084] Additional, more specific, example embodiments of perovskite devices will be
discussed in terms of further stylized depictions of example devices. The stylized nature of these
depictions, FIGs. 8-18, similarly is not intended to restrict the type of device which may in some
embodiments be constructed in accordance with any one or more of FIGs. 8-18. That is, the
architectures exhibited in FIGs. 8-18 may be adapted so as to provide the BHJs, batteries, FETs,
hybrid PV batteries, serial multi-cell PVs, parallel multi-cell PVs and other similar devices of
other embodiments of the present disclosure, in accordance with any suitable means (including
both those expressly discussed elsewhere herein, and other suitable means, which will be
apparent to those skilled in the art with the benefit of this disclosure).
        [0085] FIG. 8 depicts an example device 4100 in accordance with various embodiments.
The device 4100 illustrates embodiments including first and second glass substrates 4101 and
4109. Each glass substrate has an FTO electrode disposed upon its inner surface (first electrode
4102 and second electrode 4108, respectively), and each electrode has an interfacial layer
deposited upon its inner surface: TiO 2 first interfacial layer 4103 is deposited upon first electrode
4102, and Pt second interfacial layer 4107 is deposited upon second electrode 4108. Sandwiched
between the two interfacial layers are: a mesoporous layer 4104 (comprising TiO 2 ); photoactive
material 4105 (comprising the perovskite material MAPbI 3); and a charge transport layer 4106
(here comprising CsSnI3).
        [0086] FIG. 9 depicts an example device 4300 that omits a mesoporous layer.                The
device 4300 includes a perovskite material photoactive compound 4304 (comprising MAPbI 3)
sandwiched between first and second interfacial layers 4303 and 4305 (comprising titania and
alumina, respectively). The titania interfacial layer 4303 is coated upon an FTO first electrode
4302, which in turn is disposed on an inner surface of a glass substrate 4301.             The spiro
OMeTAD charge transport layer 4306 is coated upon an alumina interfacial layer 4305 and
disposed on an inner surface of a gold second electrode 4307.
        [0087] As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this
disclosure, various other embodiments are possible, such as a device with multiple photoactive
layers (as exemplified by photoactive layers 3906 and 3908 of the example device of FIG. 7). In
                                                  34

some embodiments, as discussed above, each photoactive layer may be separated by an
interfacial layer (as shown by third interfacial layer 3907 in FIG. 7). Furthermore, a mesoporous
layer may be disposed upon an electrode such as is illustrated in FIG. 7 by mesoporous layer
3904 being disposed upon first electrode 3902.           Although FIG. 7 depicts an intervening
interfacial layer 3903 disposed between the two, in some embodiments a mesoporous layer may
be disposed directly on an electrode.
         [0088] Additional Perovskite Material Device Examples
         [0089] Other example perovskite material device architectures will be apparent to those
of skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure. Examples include, but are not limited to,
devices containing active layers having any of the following architectures:                  (1) liquid
electrolyte-perovskite material-mesoporous layer; (2) perovskite material-dye-mesoporous
layer; (3) first perovskite material-second perovskite material-mesoporous layer; (4) first
perovskite material-second perovskite material; (5) first perovskite material-dye-second
perovskite material; (6) solid-state charge transport material-perovskite material; (7) solid-state
charge transport material-dye-perovskite material-mesoporous layer; (8) solid-state charge
transport    material-perovskite     material-dye-mesoporous         layer;  (9) solid-state    charge
transport material-dye-perovskite material-mesoporous layer; and (10) solid-state charge
transport material-perovskite material-dye-mesoporous layer. The individual components
of each example architecture (e.g., mesoporous layer, charge transport material, etc.) may be in
accordance with the discussion above for each component.               Furthermore, each example
architecture is discussed in more detail below.
         [0090] As a particular example of some of the aforementioned active layers, in some
embodiments, an active layer may include a liquid electrolyte, perovskite material, and a
mesoporous layer. The active layer of certain of these embodiments may have substantially the
architecture: liquid electrolyte-perovskite material-mesoporous layer. Any liquid electrolyte
may be suitable; and any mesoporous layer (e.g., TiO 2 ) may be suitable. In some embodiments,
the perovskite material may be deposited upon the mesoporous layer, and thereupon coated with
the liquid electrolyte. The perovskite material of some such embodiments may act at least in part
as a dye (thus, it may be photoactive).
         [0091] In other example embodiments, an active layer may include perovskite material, a
dye, and a mesoporous layer.       The active layer of certain of these embodiments may have
                                                  35

substantially the architecture: perovskite material-dye-mesoporous layer.           The dye may be
coated upon the mesoporous layer and the perovskite material may be disposed upon the dye
coated mesoporous layer.       The perovskite material may function as hole-transport material in
certain of these embodiments.
         [0092] In yet other example embodiments, an active layer may include first perovskite
material, second perovskite material, and a mesoporous layer.          The active layer of certain of
these embodiments may have substantially the architecture: first perovskite material-second
perovskite material-mesoporous layer.         The first and second perovskite material may each
comprise the same perovskite material(s) or they may comprise different perovskite materials.
Either of the first and second perovskite materials may be photoactive (e.g., a first and/or second
perovskite material of such embodiments may function at least in part as a dye).
         [0093] In certain example embodiments, an active layer may include first perovskite
material and second perovskite material. The active layer of certain of these embodiments may
have substantially the architecture: first perovskite material-second perovskite material.        The
first and second perovskite materials may each comprise the same perovskite material(s) or they
may comprise different perovskite materials. Either of the first and second perovskite materials
may be photoactive (e.g., a first and/or second perovskite material of such embodiments may
function at least in part as a dye). In addition, either of the first and second perovskite materials
may be capable of functioning as hole-transport material. In some embodiments, one of the first
and second perovskite materials functions as an electron-transport material, and the other of the
first and second perovskite materials functions as a dye.       In some embodiments, the first and
second perovskite materials may be disposed within the active layer in a manner that achieves
high interfacial area between the first perovskite material and the second perovskite material,
such as in the arrangement shown for first and second active material 2810 and 2815,
respectively, in FIG. 5 (or as similarly shown by p- and n-type material 2618 and 2620,
respectively, in FIG. 4).
         [0094] In further example embodiments, an active layer may include first perovskite
material, a dye, and second perovskite material.            The active layer of certain of these
embodiments may have substantially the architecture: first perovskite material-dye-second
perovskite material. Either of the first and second perovskite materials may function as charge
transport material, and the other of the first and second perovskite materials may function as a
                                                  36

dye. In some embodiments, both of the first and second perovskite materials may at least in part
serve overlapping, similar, and/or identical functions (e.g., both may serve as a dye and/or both
may serve as hole-transport material).
        [0095] In some other example embodiments, an active layer may include a solid-state
charge transport material and a perovskite material.        The active layer of certain of these
embodiments may have substantially the architecture: solid-state charge transport material
perovskite material.     For example, the perovskite material and solid-state charge transport
material may be disposed within the active layer in a manner that achieves high interfacial area,
such as in the arrangement shown for first and second active material 2810 and 2815,
respectively, in FIG. 5 (or as similarly shown by p- and n-type material 2618 and 2620,
respectively, in FIG. 4).
        [0096] In other example embodiments, an active layer may include a solid-state charge
transport material, a dye, perovskite material, and a mesoporous layer. The active layer of
certain of these embodiments may have substantially the architecture: solid-state charge transport
material-dye-perovskite material-mesoporous layer. The active layer of certain other of
these embodiments may have substantially the architecture:            solid-state charge transport
material-perovskite material-dye-mesoporous layer. The perovskite material may in some
embodiments serve as a second dye. The perovskite material may in such embodiments increase
the breadth of the spectrum of visible light absorbed by a PV or other device including an active
layer of such embodiments. In certain embodiments, the perovskite material may also or instead
serve as an interfacial layer between the dye and mesoporous layer, and/or between the dye and
the charge transport material.
        [0097] In some example embodiments, an active layer may include a liquid electrolyte, a
dye, a perovskite material, and a mesoporous layer.          The active layer of certain of these
embodiments may have substantially the architecture: solid-state charge transport material
dye-perovskite material-mesoporous layer.            The active layer of certain other of these
embodiments may have substantially the architecture: solid-state charge transport material
perovskite material-dye-mesoporous layer. The perovskite material may serve as photoactive
material, an interfacial layer, and/or a combination thereof.
        [0098] Some embodiments provide BHJ PV devices that include perovskite materials.
For example, a BHJ of some embodiments may include a photoactive layer (e.g., photoactive
                                                 37

layer 2404 of FIG. 3), which may include one or more perovskite materials. The photoactive
layer of such a BHJ may also or instead include any one or more of the above-listed example
components discussed above with respect to DSSC active layers. Further, in some embodiments,
the BHJ photoactive layer may have an architecture according to any one of the example
embodiments of DSSC active layers discussed above.
        [0099] In some embodiments, any of the active layers including perovskite materials
incorporated into PVs or other devices as discussed herein may further include any of the various
additional materials also discussed herein as suitable for inclusion in an active layer.          For
example, any active layer including perovskite material may further include an interfacial layer
according to various embodiments discussed herein (such as, e.g., a thin-coat interfacial layer).
By way of further example, an active layer including perovskite material may further include a
light harvesting layer, such as Light Harvesting Layer 1601 as depicted in the example PV
represented in FIG. 2.
        [00100]        Formulation of the Perovskite Material Active Layer
        [00101]        As discussed earlier, in some embodiments, a perovskite material in the
active layer may have the formulation CMX 3 -yX'y (0 > y > 3), where: C comprises one or more
cations (e.g., an amine, ammonium, a Group 1 metal, a Group 2 metal, formamidinium,
guanidinium, ethene tetramine and/or other cations or cation-like compounds); M comprises one
or more metals (e.g., Fe, Cd, Co, Ni, Cu, Hg, Sn, Pb, Bi, Ge, Ti, Zn, and Zr); and X and X'
comprise one or more anions. In one embodiment, the perovskite material may comprise CPbI 3
yCly. In certain embodiments, the perovskite material may be deposited as an active layer in a
PV device by, for example, drop casting, spin casting, slot-die printing, screen printing, or ink-jet
printing onto a substrate layer using the steps described below.
        [00102]        First, a lead halide precursor ink is formed. An amount of lead halide may
be massed in a clean, dry vial inside a glove box (i.e., controlled atmosphere box with glove
containing portholes allows for materials manipulation in an air-free environment). Suitable lead
halides include, but are not limited to, lead (II) iodide, lead (II) bromide, lead (II) chloride, and
lead (II) fluoride.  The lead halide may comprise a single species of lead halide or it may
comprise a lead halide mixture in a precise ratio.        In certain embodiments, the lead halide
mixture may comprise any binary, ternary, or quaternary ratio of 0.001-100 mol% of iodide,
bromide, chloride, or fluoride. In one embodiment, the lead halide mixture may comprise lead
                                                  38

(II) chloride and lead (II) iodide in a ratio of about 10:90 mol:mol. In other embodiments, the
lead halide mixture may comprise lead (II) chloride and lead (II) iodide in a ratio of about 5:95,
about 7.5:92.5, or about 15:85 mol:mol.
         [00103]         Alternatively, other lead salt precursors may be used in conjunction with
or in lieu of lead halide salts to form the precursor ink. Suitable precursor salts may comprise
any combination of lead (II) or lead(IV) and the following anions: nitrate, nitrite, carboxylate,
acetate,    formate,    oxylate,   sulfate,   sulfite,  thiosulfate,   phosphate,   tetrafluoroborate,
hexafluorophosphate, tetra(perfluorophenyl) borate, hydride, oxide, peroxide, hydroxide, nitride,
arsenate, arsenite, perchlorate, carbonate, bicarbonate, chromate, dichromate, iodate, bromate,
chlorate,    chlorite, hypochlorite,    hypobromite,    cyanide,    cyanate,  isocyanate,   fulminate,
thiocyanate,     isothiocyanate,    azide,   tetracarbonylcobaltate,     carbamoyldicyanomethanide,
dicyanonitrosomethanide, dicyanamide, tricyanomethanide, amide, and permanganate.
         [00104]         The precursor ink may further comprise a lead (II) or lead (IV) salt in
mole ratios of 0 to 100% to the following metal ions Fe, Cd, Co, Ni, Cu, Hg, Sn, Pb, Bi, Ge, Ti,
Zn, and Zr as a salt of the aforementioned anions.
         [00105]         A solvent may then be added to the vial to dissolve the lead solids to form
the lead halide precursor ink. Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, dry N-cyclohexyl
2-pyrrolidone, alkyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethylformamide, dialkylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO), methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, tetrahydrofuran, formamide, tert-butylpyridine,
pyridine,     alkylpyridine,   pyrrolidine,  chlorobenzene,     dichlorobenzene,    dichloromethane,
chloroform, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the lead solids are dissolved in dry
dimethylformamide (DMF). The lead solids may be dissolved at a temperature between about
20'C to about 150'C. In one embodiment, the lead solids are dissolved at about 85'C. The lead
solids may be dissolved for as long as necessary to form a solution, which may take place over a
time period up to about 72 hours. The resulting solution forms the base of the lead halide
precursor ink. In some embodiments, the lead halide precursor ink may have a lead halide
concentration between about 0.OO1M and about 10M.              In one embodiment, the lead halide
precursor ink has a lead halide concentration of about 1 M.
         [00106]         Optionally, certain additives may be added to the lead halide precursor ink
to affect the final perovskite crystallinity and stability. In some embodiments, the lead halide
precursor ink may further comprise an amino acid (e.g., 5-aminovaleric acid, histidine, glycine,
                                                    39

lycine), an amino acid hydrohalide (e.g., 5-amino valeric acid hydrochloride), an IFL surface
modifying (SAM) agent (such as those discussed earlier in the specification), or a combination
thereof. In one embodiment, formamidinium chloride may be added to the lead halide precursor
ink. In other embodiments, the halide of any cation discussed earlier in the specification may be
used.    In some embodiments, combinations of additives may be added to the lead halide
precursor ink including, for example, the combination of formamidinium chloride and 5-amino
valeric acid hydrochloride.
        [00107]         By way of explanation, and without limiting the disclosure to any
particular theory of mechanism, it has been found that formamidinium and 5-amino valeric acid
improve perovskite PV device stability when they are used as additives or counter-cations in a
one-step perovskite device fabrication. It has also been found that chloride, in the form of PbCl 2 ,
improves perovskite PV device performance when added to a PbI 2 precursor solution in a two
step method. It has been found that the two-step perovskite thin film deposition process may be
improved by adding formamidinium chloride and/or 5-amino valeric acid hydrochloride directly
to a lead halide precursor solution (e.g., PbI 2) to leverage both advantages with a single material.
Other perovskite film deposition processes may likewise be improved by the addition of
formamidinium chloride, 5-amino valeric acid hydrochloride, or PbCl 2 to a lead halide precursor
solution.
        [00108]         The additives, including formamidinium chloride and/or 5-amino valeric
acid hydrochloride. may be added to the lead halide precursor ink at various concentrations
depending on the desired characteristics          of the resulting perovskite material.      In one
embodiment, the additives may be added in a concentration of about 1 nM to about n M. In
another embodiment, the additives may be added in a concentration of about n ptM to about I M.
In another embodiment, the additives may be added in a concentration of about 1 pM to about 1
mM.
        [00109]         Optionally, in certain embodiments, water may be added to the lead halide
precursor ink. By way of explanation, and without limiting the disclosure to any particular
theory or mechanism, the presence of water affects perovskite thin-film crystalline growth.
Under normal circumstances, water may be absorbed as vapor from the air.              However, it is
possible to control the perovskite PV crystallinity through the direct addition of water to the lead
halide precursor ink in specific concentrations.        Suitable water includes distilled, deionized
                                                   40

water, or any other source of water that is substantially free of contaminants (including
minerals). It has been found, based on light I-V sweeps, that the perovskite PV light-to-power
conversion efficiency may nearly triple with the addition of water compared to a completely dry
device.
        [00110]         The water may be added to the lead halide precursor ink at various
concentrations depending on the desired characteristics of the resulting perovskite material. In
one embodiment, the water may be added in a concentration of about 1 nL/mL to about 1
mL/mL. In another embodiment, the water may be added in a concentration of about I tL/mL to
about 0.1 mL/mL. In another embodiment, the water may be added in a concentration of about 1
pL/mL to about 20 pL/mL.
        [00111]         FIG.   12   shows    images from a cross-sectional      scanning  electron
microscope comparing a perovskite PV fabricated with water (5110) and without water (5120).
As may be seen from FIG. 12, there is considerable structural change in the perovskite material
layer (5111 and 5121) when water is excluded (bottom) during fabrication, as compared to when
water is included (top).       The perovskite material layer 5111 (fabricated with water) is
considerably more contiguous and dense than perovskite material layer 5121 (fabricated without
water).
        [00112]         The lead halide precursor ink may then be deposited on the desired
substrate. Suitable substrate layers may include any of the substrate layers identified earlier in
this disclosure. As noted above, the lead halide precursor ink may be deposited through a variety
of means, including but not limited to, drop casting, spin casting, slot-die printing, screen
printing, or ink-jet printing.  In certain embodiments, the lead halide precursor ink may be spin
coated onto the substrate at a speed of about 500 rpm to about 10,000 rpm for a time period of
about 5 seconds to about 600 seconds. In one embodiment, the lead halide precursor ink may be
spin-coated onto the substrate at about 3000 rpm for about 30 seconds. The lead halide precursor
ink may be deposited on the substrate at an ambient atmosphere in a humidity range of about 0%
relative humidity to about 50% relative humidity.     The lead halide precursor ink may then be
allowed to dry in a substantially water-free atmosphere, i.e., less than 20% relative humidity, to
form a thin film.
        [00113]         The thin film may then be thermally annealed for a time period up to about
24 hours at a temperature of about 20 0 C to about 3000 C. In one embodiment, the thin film may
                                                 41

be thermally annealed for about ten minutes at a temperature of about 50 'C.           The perovskite
material active layer may then be completed by a conversion process in which the precursor film
is submerged or rinsed with a solution comprising a solvent or mixture of solvents (e.g., DMF,
isopropanol, methanol, ethanol, butanol, chloroform chlorobenzene, dimethylsulfoxide, water)
and salt (e.g., methylammonium iodide, formamidinium iodide, guanidinium iodide, 1,2,2
triaminovinylammonium iodide, 5-aminovaleric acid hydroiodide) in a concentration between
0.001M and 1OM. In certain embodiments, the thin films may also be thermally post-annealed in
the same fashion as in the first line of this paragraph.
         [00114]        Therefore, the present invention is well adapted to attain the ends and
advantages mentioned as well as those that are inherent therein. The particular embodiments
disclosed above are illustrative only, as the present invention may be modified and practiced in
different but equivalent manners apparent to those skilled in the art having the benefit of the
