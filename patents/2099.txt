               SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR NON-CELLULAR WIRELESS ACCESS
  5 TECHNICAL FIELD
    [0001] The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent Application
    No. 2014352838, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
    10002] The present invention relates to a system and method for wireless communications, and, in
    particular embodiments, to a system and method for non-cellular wireless access in radio access
  0 networks.
    BACKGROUND
    10003] For the past 40 years, the cellular cell has functioned as the atom of the wireless network, as
    shown in Figure 1. A cellular system 100 includes a plurality of transmit points (TPs) 104 each with
    an associated coverage area or cell 102. UEs 106 communicate only with the TP 104 in the cell 102
  5 in which the UE 106 is associated using an ID specific for the cell 102. When a UE 106 moves to
    another cell, a handover between TPs 104 must occur and the UE 106 is associated with a new TP 104
    through a new cell ID. However, radio access performance is limited by inter-cell interference.
    Further, as shown in plot 200 of spectral efficiency in Figure 2, there is non-uniform spectral
    efficiency across a cell.

    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS
    10020] The making and using of the presently preferred embodiments are discussed in detail below.
    It should be appreciated, however, that the present invention provides many applicable inventive
    concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments
 .0 discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not limit the
    scope of the invention.
    10021] An embodiment solves the interference issue in a fundamental way by removing the cell
    boundary to go from cellular to non-cellular, as shown in the example of Figure 3. An embodiment
    removes the cell grid. An embodiment removes handover. An embodiment removes the cell ID
J5  which is associated with a base station, and instead organizes the system around a user ID associated
    with the User Equipment. In contrast, the virtual cell or soft cell approach still uses the cell ID to
    design the air interface, where user equipment (UE) and transmit point (TP) association is based on
    the cell ID detected by the UE.
    10022] An embodiment provides an air interface design to support non-cellular based wireless access.
30  An embodiment uses a UE-centric design instead of a cell-centric design. An embodiment replaces
    the cell ID with a UE-dedicated connection ID.
    10023] In an embodiment, a virtual UE connects to a logical access entity, instead of a physical UE
    connecting to a physical cell. A UE accesses the network through a logical entity, which allows
    physical TPs to be transparent to UEs.
                                                        -3-

  5 10024] An embodiment uses network-oriented measurement, instead of UE-oriented measurement.
    Because there is no TP-based cell ID, UE and physical TP association can be determined by the
    network according to uplink (UL) transmission-based measurement.
    10025] An embodiment uses a UE-centric adaptive topology instead of a static topology.
    10026] In an embodiment, each TP node monitors each UE in its signal range and the central
  0 controller assigns a TP to a UE based on signal strength of the UE at the various TPs within range of
    the UE. The process is transparent to the UE. Once the UE receives a UE dedicated connection ID or
    a logical entity ID, the UE transmits with the UE dedicated connection ID received or one created by
    the UE from the logical entity ID while in a coverage area of a logical entity that includes a plurality
    of TPs. In an embodiment, the UE communications with the network include its dedicated connection
  5 ID which is generated from a logical entity ID and the UE ID. Any of the TPs (or a subset of TPs) in
    the logical entity that can detect the UE can provide radio access to the UE.
    10027] In an embodiment, a method for non-cellular grid based radio access (i.e., non-cell based
    radio access) in a radio access network includes determining, by a controller, a group of physical
    transmit points (TPs) to assign to a logical entity; assigning, by the controller, a logical entity
 !0 identifier (ID) to the group of physical transmit points (TPs) comprising the logical entity; sending, by
    the controller, the logical entity ID to a UE, wherein the logical entity ID identifies the logical entity
    within the radio access network through which the UE communicates with the radio access network;
    and generating, by the controller, a UE-dedicated connection ID according to a UE ID and the logical
    entity ID, wherein the UE accesses the radio network utilizing the UE-dedicated connection ID
 .5 through at least one of the TPs in the logical entity.
    10028] The UE-dedicated connection ID remains the same as long as the UE is communicating with
    a TP within the logical entity. Assigning the logical entity ID to a group of physical TPs includes
    selecting a group of TPs to serve the UE utilizing a UE-TP association table. In an embodiment, the
    controller dynamically or semi-statically can change the TPs assigned to the logical entity in
30  accordance with at least one of network attributes and UE attributes. In an embodiment, semi
    statically changing the TPs assigned to the logical entity means that the TPs assigned to the logical
    entity change infrequently. In an embodiment, the TPs assigned to the logical entity change
    periodically. The controller can make a determination as to whether to change the TPs assigned to the
    logical entity either periodically or in response to changing conditions. In an embodiment, the
35  controller makes a decision as to whether to change the TPs assigned to the logical entity
    aperiodically in response to changes in network conditions, TP status, or some other criteria. The
    network attributes may include at least one of a number of active UEs within the radio access network,
    network congestion, network power consumption, and the type of network traffic. In an embodiment,
    the controller dynamically determines a second group of TPs (e.g., physical TPs and/or virtual TPs) to
                                                         -4-

  5 assign to the logical entity where at least some of the TPs in the original and the second groups do not
    belong to both groups. In an embodiment, the controller powers down at least one of the TPs in the
    group. This may be done, for example, to reduce power consumption when there are fewer UEs
    actively accessing the network or less traffic through the radio access network. The logical entity can
    provide wireless access for a coverage area that is larger than the coverage area for a single TP.
  0 10029] In an embodiment, the controller sends a second logical entity ID associated with a second
    logical entity to the UE when the UE travels out of a coverage area for the original logical entity and
    into a coverage area for the second logical entity. The second logical entity includes a second group
    of TPs where at least some of the TPs in the second group are different from at least some of the TPs
    in the original group (i.e., the second logical entity includes at least one non-overlapping coverage
  5 area with the coverage area of the first logical entity).
    10030] In an embodiment, the controller generates a UE-TP relation table in accordance with uplink
    (UL) measurements from the UE. In an embodiment, building the UE-TP relation table is performed
    using sounding signals and/or data signals from the UE. The controller sends control and/or data to
    the UE through a UE-centric channel via at least one of the TPs in the logical entity. In an
 .0 embodiment, the controller assigns one or more of the TPs in the group to provide radio access to the
    UE. In an embodiment, the TPs in the group assigned to provide radio access to the UE is determined
    according to relative signal strength of the UE at each of the TPs in the group.
    10031] In an embodiment, a controller executes a method for non-cellular wireless access that
    includes receiving measured signal strengths of a user equipment (UE) from a plurality of transmit
 .5 points (TPs); generating a UE neighborhood table according to the measured signal strengths and TPs
    detecting the UE; creating a logical entity or determining an identity of a logical entity to serve the
    UE, wherein the logical entity comprises a plurality of TPs; selecting one of the TPs from the plurality
    of TPs to provide radio access to the UE; and sending control information and/or data to the UE via
    the selected TP(s) through a UE centric channel. In an embodiment, the controller dynamically
30  determines, from the logical entity, a new TP to provide radio access to the UE in response to a
    change in relative signal strengths between the TPs in the logical entity. In an embodiment, the
    controller determines the TP(s) that can best serve an individual UE. Depending on the location of a
    UE, sometimes, more than one TP can serve the UE cooperatively. For example, if a UE can receive a
    strong signal from several TPs nearby, these TPs can transmit the same data to this UE in a
35  cooperative manner such that the joint signals reaching the UE significantly improve the user
    experience. In an embodiment, the controller dynamically determines, from the logical entity, a new
    TP to provide radio access to the UE for load balancing in response to changes in the loads on the TPs
    in the logical entity.

  5 10032] Fig. 3 is a diagram that illustrates a conversion from a cellular system 300 to an embodiment
    non-cellular system 310. The cellular system 300 includes a plurality of a TPs 304 each with an
    associated cell 302. Each UE 306 connects only with the TP 304 within the cell 302 in which the UE
    306 is located. Although the UE 306 can receive data signals from more than one TP, the control
    signals to the UE 306 can only come from the serving TP 304 within the cell 302 in which the UE 306
  0 is located.
    10033] Non-cellular system 310 includes a plurality of TPs 304, UEs, 306, and a cloud processor 308.
    As used herein, the term TP may also be referred to as an access point (AP) and the two terms may be
    used interchangeably throughout this disclosure. The TPs 304 may include any component capable of
    providing wireless access by establishing uplink and/or downlink connections with the UEs 306, such
  5 as a base transceiver station (BTS), a NodeB, an enhanced NodeB (eNB), a femtocell, and other
    wirelessly enabled devices. The UEs 306 may comprise any component capable of establishing a
    wireless connection with the TPs 304. The TPs 304 may be connected to the cloud processor via a
    backhaul network (not shown). The backhaul network may be any component or collection of
    components that allow data to be exchanged between the TPs 304 and the cloud processor 308 and/or
 .0 a remote end (not shown). In some embodiments, the network 100 may comprise various other
    wireless devices, such as relays, femtocells, etc. The cloud processor may be any type of data
    processing system capable of performing the processes disclosed below and capable of
    communication with other devices.
    10034] In non-cellular system 310, the TPs 304 are not associated with a cell. The system 310
 .5 includes a cloud processor 308 which organizes the TPs 304 into logical entities. Each UE 306 is
    assigned to a logical entity and is assigned a unique UE dedicated connection ID. In an embodiment,
    the UE can be a mobile phone, a sensor, a smart phone, or other wireless device. The UE 306 may
    move freely within an area serviced by a single logical entity without acquiring a new UE dedicated
    connection ID. Each TP 304 monitors signal strengths for any UE 306 detectable by the TP 304 and
30  sends this data to the cloud processor 308. The cloud processor creates a logical entity or determines
    the identity of a logical entity to be assigned to serve each UE according to the measured signal
    strengths measured by the TPs 304. This determination can be performed dynamically in some
    embodiments. The cloud processor 308 assigns a logical entity ID to the logical entity and assigns a
    UE dedicated connection ID to each UE 306 according to the logical entity ID to which the UE 306 is
35  assigned and the UE ID of the UE 306. In an embodiment, the UE 306 obtains the logical entity ID
    from the network and generates a dedicated connection ID from the logical entity ID and the UE ID.
    In this scenario, the network does not need to assign a UE dedicated connection ID to the UE 306.
    However, in either case, the communication between the UE 306 and the network is based on the
    dedicated connection ID. This UE dedicated connection ID is used by the UE when transmitting and
40  receiving. The cloud processor 308 selects one of the TPs 304 from the group of TPs 304 in the
                                                         -6-

  5 logical entity to provide radio access to the UE 306 based on its dedicated connection ID. In an
    embodiment, the cloud processor 308 selects the TP 304 based on relative signal strengths of the UE
    306 at each of the TPs 304 in the logical entity and/or the loads of each TP 304 in the logical entity.
    In other embodiments, other selection criteria can be utilized. In an embodiment, the cloud processor
    308 dynamically reassigns a new TP 304 in the logical entity to serve the UE 306 based on changes to
  0 the signal strength of the UE at each TP 304 in the logical entity. The change in signal strength may
    be due to UE mobility or to other factors.
    10035] In an embodiment, the cloud processor 308 can enable or disable one or more TPs 304
    covered by a logical entity to reach a substantially best tradeoff between the service quality provided
    to all covered UEs 306 and energy saving criteria.
  5 10036] In an embodiment, the cloud processor 308 determines the TPs 304 to be assigned to a logical
    entity based on the geographic location of the TPs 304. In another embodiment, the cloud processor
    308 determines the TPs 304 to be assigned to a logical entity based on the user distribution,
    application types and traffic loads.
    10037] In an embodiment, the TPs 304 assigned to a logical entity may be changed dynamically by
 .0 the cloud processor 308 according to changes in network conditions. For example, at times of low
    radio access network utilization, some of the TPs 304 may be powered down to conserve power. At
    times of higher network utilization, more TPs 304 may be powered up in order to more efficiently
    serve the UEs 306 in the area and reduce congestion.
    10038] In an embodiment, the TPs 304 assigned to a logical entity may be enabled/disabled (e.g.,
 !5 powered on or off) in a distributed manner as determined by a TP's 304 measurement of certain
    parameters (e.g., UEs 306 covered by the TP) and the communications between TPs 304.
    Determining which TP 304 should be turned on or off could depend on various factors such as, for
    example, the UE 306 and TP 304 association relationship, UE 306 distribution, the Quality of Service
    (QoS) required, energy saving, etc.
30  10039] Fig. 4 illustrates an embodiment of a system 400 of components enabling non-cellular
    wireless access. In an embodiment, the system includes a cloud group processor 402, a virtual Tx and
    virtual Rx component 404, a Hyper Transceiver (HT) component 406, a hyper cell 408, new physical
    (PHY) channels interface 410, a UE dedicated connection ID component 412, and a network oriented
    measurement system 414 to provide non-cellular wireless access to wireless devices. The cloud group
35  processor 402 provides centralized signal processing. The virtual Tx and virtual Rx 404 provide UE
    centric TP optimization and UE centric device mash. The HT component 406 provides
    communications between distributed transmitters and distributed receivers. The hyper cell 408
    provides a novel UE and TP association mechanism. The new PHY channels interface 410 provide a
    UE centric PHY channel designs. The UE dedicated connection ID component 412 generates a UE
                                                        -7-

  5 dedicated connection ID and provides a UE connection mechanism. The network oriented
    measurement 414 provides a UL centric measurement scheme.
    10040] Fig. 5 illustrates an embodiment of a non-cellular wireless access system 500. System 500
    includes a plurality of TPs 510 and UEs 512. System 500 also includes a controller 508 in
    communication with the TPs 510. Each UE 512 is detectable by some of the TPs 510 (represented by
  0 solid lines) and not detectable by other TPs 510 (represented by dashed lines). The controller 508
    uses a UE and TP relation map 502 and a UE-centric TP optimizer 504 to provide an output of a
    method to the controller 508. From this, the controller 508 determines a UE-centric control channel
    and data channel 506. The UE and TP relation map indicates which UEs 512 are detectable by which
    TPs 510 and can, in some embodiments, provide the relative signal strengths of each UE 512 at each
  5 TP 510. The UE centric TP optimization scheme 504 may utilize factors such as relative signal
    strength, network load at each TP 510, network power consumption, TP power consumption, quality
    of service requirements, as well as other factors to determine a UE centric control channel and data
    channel 506. The control channel and data channel may come from the same TP (or TPs) or from
    different TP(s). The controller 508 also determines which of the TPs 510 should serve a respective
 .0 UE 512. Membership in the set of TP 510 serving a particular UE 512 may change dynamically or
    semi-statically over time as determined by the controller 508 in response to changing network, TP 510,
    and/or UE 512 conditions, and traffic condition. The UE 512 need not know the ID of a particular TP
    510 that it is transmitting to, but rather merely communicates with the system 500 without needing to
    know which physical TP 510 is actually serving the UE 512. Once the UE centric control channel and
 .5 data channel are determined by the controller 508, the control and data signals are sent to the UE 512.
    The UE 512 uses its dedicated connection ID which is associated with logical entity ID for all
    communication within the network as long as the UE 512 is in the area serviced by the logical entity.
    The UE 512 does not need to know which TP 510 is serving it. The UE 512 merely transmits on the
    UE centric channel and receives signals on the UE centric channel regardless of which TP 510
30  transmits. The UE 512 may move freely within the area serviced by the logical entity without
    changing a UE dedicated communication ID. The controller 508 will change the TP 510 serving the
    UE 508 dynamically and transparently to the UE 510 to accommodate UE 512 mobility.
    10041] Fig. 6 is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a method 600 for non-cellular wireless
    access. The method 600 begins at block 602 where a TP measures signal strength of a detectable UE.
35  At block 604, the TP reports the measurements to a controller. At block 606, the controller generates
    and updates a UE neighborhood table. At block 608, the controller selects the TPs to serve the UE.
    The TP or TPs selected to serve the UE may be the TP or TPs determined to be the best or
    substantially the best according to various criteria used by the controller. At block 610, the controller
    sends control/data to the UE through a UE-centric channel (CH), after which, the method 600 ends.
40  In an embodiment, the method 600 may be encoded as a set of computer readable instructions and
                                                         -8-

  5 stored on a computer readable storage media that, when implemented by a data processing system,
    causes the data processing system to execute the method 600.
    10042] Fig. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a method 700 for the formation of a UE
    dedicated connection ID. With respect to a logical entity ID, a logical entity covers a group of
    physical TPs. The coverage area of the logical entity can be configured dynamically by the network
  0 according to network topology, UE distribution, load distribution, and energy consumption
    expectation. Each logical entity is assigned an logical entity ID 704. The logical entity ID 704 can be
    used to manage interference of the transmission of broadcast singling and common control signaling.
    It can also be applied to generate synchronization signal. For example, the reference signals carried
    by the synchronization channel can be generated from the logical entity ID. The method 700
  5 combines the UE ID 702 with the logical entity ID 704 to generate a UE dedicated connection ID 706.
    10043] Generation and management of UE dedicated connection ID 706 can enable efficient UE
    centric access and measurement, and allow for optimization of resource allocation, such as UL
    resource reuse. As discussed above, a UE dedicated connection ID 706 is generated from a UE ID 702
    and a logical entity ID 704. A UE obtains a logical entity ID 704 from the network through blind
 !0 sequence detection during initial access (for example the detection of Synchronization reference
    signals), or downlink (DL) signaling. It may be carried by a broadcast signal, carried by a common
    control signal, carried by a UE-special signal, for example when moving to the coverage of a
    neighboring logical entity, and the like.
    10044] For UE and TP association relation map generation, a UE accesses the network based on a
 .5 network synchronization channel. The synchronization channel no longer needs to carry the cell-ID
    as in older cellular access based wireless technologies. In an embodiment, the synchronization
    channel carries the logical entity ID. Timing for the UE synchronizes to the strongest path or to the
    average of the strongest paths.
    10045] A UE is assigned a UE dedicated connection ID 706 after initial access. Each TP monitors a
30  UL sounding signal or keep-alive signaling associated with the UE dedicated connection ID to obtain
    signal strength information of the detected UEs. Each TP reports the measurement results to the
    controller. The report can be periodic, or it can be generated when measurements change more than a
    predetermined amount. The controller generates and maintains a UE and TP relation table including
    neighborhood TPs for each UE.

    central controller 802 covers multiple logical entities 804, 806. Each logical entity 804, 806 include a
    plurality of TPs 810. One skilled in the art will appreciate that it is possible in some embodiments for
    a logical entity to only include a single TP. There is a transparent boundary between the coverage of
    neighboring logical entities 804, 806. The system 800 supports seamless UE mobility, where the UE

    804 and to logical entity 806. In an embodiment, one or more TPs 810 may belong to both logical
    entities 804, 806. A hyper cell 812, 814 defines a coverage area provided by a logical entity 804, 806.
    In an embodiment, the coverage area defined by the hyper cell 812, 814 is equivalent to the coverage
    area provided by the combination of TPs 810 in the logical entity 804,806 corresponding to the hyper
  0 cell 812, 814. In an embodiment, the coverage area defined by the hyper cell 812, 814 includes an
    area that is smaller than all the coverage area provided by the combination of TPs 810 in the logical
    entity 804, 806 corresponding to the hyper cell 812, 814.

    area network for data processing and communications with remote devices, such as other processing
    units, the Internet, remote storage facilities, or the like.
    10054] As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, many existing mobile networks are built
 .5 around a cell-based structure. As a mobile device moves from one cell to another, the device is
    subject to a handover which introduces overhead in the network. At the edge of one cell, a UE is
    subject to intercell interference from adjacent cells. In a particular scenario a UE at the boundary of
    two cells can be subject to large amounts of intercell interference and possibly repeated handovers
    between the two cells.
30  10055] Fast moving UEs, in areas covered by small cell deployments, are subjected to a large number
    of handovers in short time periods which adversely impacts both the network and the UE's ability to
    maintain a reliable data connection.
    10056] To address these issues, the above described techniques can be used to enable a mobile
    wireless network where a UE initiates a connection, and in response, a central entity associates a
35  plurality of transmit points with the UE. This plurality of transmit points can be based on a UE-TP
    association table that is built based on individual TPs reporting signal characteristics associated with
    transmissions received from the UE. It should be understood that the logical entity created to co
    ordinate the activities of the plurality of transmit points associated with the UE can be given a number
    of different names including a hyper cell. At least one TP in the hyper cell should be able to transmit
                                                          -11-

  5 signals to and receive signals from the UE. It should be recognized that in practice it is likely that a
    number of TPs in the hyper cell will be able to "sce" the UE, which should be understood to mean that
    the TP can form a radio communication channel with the UE. It should also be understood that the
    hyper cell can include TPs that cannot currently see the UE. This allows the UE to move a greater
    distance while still being under the coverage area of the hyper cell.
  0 10057] As a UE moves, the channel characteristics to different TPs in the hyper cell will change. A
    central controller can use this information (which may include explicit location information provided
    by the UE such as GPS co-ordinates or location information ascertained in accordance with detection
    of radio resources such as base stations and WiFi access points) to modify the membership of the
    hyper cell. This allows a network entity to remove TPs that the UE is unlikely to need access to from
  5 the hyper cell and add other TPs that the UE has a higher likelihood to need access to. In one example,
    as a UE moves along a road, TPs that the UE is moving away from can be removed from the hyper
    cell while TPs that the UE is moving towards can be added to the hyper cell.
    10058] By having multiple TPs that can see the UE as a part of the same hyper cell, intercell
    interference can be mitigated by co-operatively serving the needs of the UE. Additionally, by having
 .0 the membership of the hyper cell change as the UE moves with respect to the topology of the network,
    the number of handovers that the UE is subjected to can be reduced, and possibly eliminated.
    10059] One skilled in the art will appreciate that modifications to the membership of a hyper cell may
    be performed as a result of predicted changes to characteristics of UE connectivity. For example, it
    may be determined by a network planning routine that a particular TP should be powered down to
 !5 save energy. When the TP to be powered down is identified as part of a hyper cell serving a particular
    UE, the hyper cell membership can be modified and the TP can be removed from the logical entity. In
    doing so, network traffic associated with the UE will no longer be routed to the TP. This can be done
    prior to the powering down of the TP so that adverse effects on connected UEs can be minimized.
    Although discussion herein has focused on powering down a TP, any Operations And Maintenance
30  (O&M or O&AM) function. Additionally, where it has been discussed that a hyper cell membership
    can be changed due to the removal of a TP for service or power savings functions, it should also be
    noted that hyper cell membership can also be modified in response to a TP being powered on (or in
    response to advanced notice that a TP is going to be powered on).
    10060] When a UE attaches to the network, the hyper cell created to serve the UE can be assigned an
35  identifier. The UE can be provided an identifier of the hyper cell so that it can include this identifier
    will all transmissions it sends. It should be recognized that the assigned identifier should be unique
    across the network (globally unique). The UE may receive either all or part of the hyper cell identifier,
    but in cases where it only receives a portion of the identifier, the UE should be able to
    programmatically determine the whole identifier. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the
                                                       -12-

  5 assigned identifier will be globally unique if it includes a UE identifier which is guaranteed to be
    unique.
