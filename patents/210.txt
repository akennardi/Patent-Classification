   Field of the invention
              The present invention relates to a guard rail scaffolding system which provides fall
 5 protection in relation to a building structure. The present invention also relates to brackets
   for use in the system and a method of installing such a system.
   Background
10             In the construction of multistorey building structures, guard rail scaffolding is
   commonly used to support workers and to protect them from falling from an elevated
   height. However, the erecting of such scaffolding typically occurs in stages which are
   staggered with the actual construction of the building structure. For example, wooden
   frame members might first be erected to form a building frame, or a part thereof, before
15 corresponding scaffolding can be installed. This approach can delay or prolong the time
   required to construct a building structure, and thus increase the costs associated therewith.
               Examples of the present invention seek to solve, or at least ameliorate, one or more
   disadvantages associated with of previous guard rail scaffolding.

   Summary
              There is provided a guard rail scaffolding system for a building structure,
   comprising:
25             brackets securable to frame members of the building structure, each bracket
   presenting, when the frame members are erected to define the frame of the building
   structure, a fastening point for an upright support member;
              a plurality of upright support members, each fastened at a lower portion thereof to
              a corresponding bracket for supporting a guard rail; and at least one guard rail
30            extending between upright support members.

   Detailed description
               Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the present guard rail scaffolding system 1 installed in
   respect of a building structure comprising frame members 75 and floor joists 60; the
 5 building structure could, for example, be that of a house or a commercial building. The
   system 1 includes a plurality of support brackets 5, each bracket 5 being preferably metallic
   and secured to respective frame members 75 via known securing means 30 such as screws
   for example. While building frame members 75 are often wooden, it is envisaged that the
   present system would also be adaptable to non-wooden frame members. For example, the
10 brackets 5 could be secured to steel frame members via welding.
              With reference to Figures 4 to 6, each bracket 5 includes a substantially rectangular
   planar portion 15 which is securable to a frame member 75, and a central raised portion
   20 defining an opening 80 for slidingly receiving the bottom arm 40 of an upright support
15 member 10. In the example depicted in Figure 6, it is envisaged that the raised portion 20
   of the bracket 5 can accommodate a spring-loaded pin 25 which can be located against the
   upright support member 10 for releasably fastening it to the bracket 5. In another example,
   the spring-loaded pin 25 can be received through a corresponding hole in the upright
   support member 10, thereby securing the upright support member 10 to the bracket 5. Of
20 course, other common fastening means (e.g. screws, bolts, welding) may be used to fasten
   an upright support member 10 to a corresponding bracket 5.
              While it is envisaged that the bracket 5 is substantially metallic and can be
   galvanised and/or formed of mild steel, it can of course be formed from other suitably
25 strong and secure materials. As such, the bracket, which is generally a flush plate having
   a square hollow section welded thereon, provides a simple and cheap connection point to
   which an upright support member 10 can be secured.
               Referring to Figures 1 to 3, each upright support member 10 comprises a support
30 arm 35 extending upwardly from the bottom arm 40, the support arm 35 having one or
   more supports 45 for supporting a wooden guard rail 50. In the depicted example, each

   P10029.AU Complete Specification_001_3.Docx - 7/12/2017
                                                           -5
   support 45 comprises a flanged ledge for accommodating a guard rail 50. In this way, one
   or more guard rails 50 can be supported by and extend between adjacent upright support
   members 10. It is envisaged that each guard rail 50 can be fastened to corresponding
   upright support members 10 via common fastening means 55 such as screws or bolts. Of
 5 course, characteristics such as the positioning and configuration of the guard rails 50 can
   be varied so as to optimise their ability to protect workers from falling from elevated
   heights.
               It will be appreciated that wooden frame members 75 which make up a building
10 frame are often rectangular in cross-section and thus present two opposed narrower faces,
   each adjacent to two opposed wider faces. In these cases, it is preferred that each bracket
   5 is secured to the wider face of a respective frame member 75 - the wider face typically
   defining an inner side of the building frame.
15             In order to reduce the construction time required at the building site of the building
   structure, it is envisaged that the brackets 5 can each be secured to respective frame
   members 75 before the frame members 75 are actually delivered to the building site.
               In this way, once the frame members 75 are delivered to the building site, their
20 very erection to form the building frame also amounts to simultaneously forming at least
   part of the guard rail scaffolding system. As such, once the frame members 75 with pre
   secured brackets 5 are erected, only the upright support members 10 and/or guard rails 50
   need to be installed to complete the guard rail scaffolding, thereby reducing the time
   required to erect a building frame and install a scaffolding system at a building site, while
25 still providing a system that meets the requisite safety requirements.
               It is also envisaged that each upright support member 10 can be secured to the
   pre-secured brackets prior to or after delivery of the frame members 75 to the building site.
   For example, each upright support member 10 could be connected to a respective bracket
30 5 via a hinged connection. As such, once the frame members 75 with pre-secured brackets
   5 and upright support members are erected at a building site, only the guard rails 50 need

                                                           -6
   to be installed to complete the guard rail scaffolding, thereby reducing the time required to
   erect a building frame and install a scaffolding system at a building site.
              Once the guard rail scaffolding system is no longer required, the guard rails 50 can
 5  be unfastened from the upright support members 10, the upright support members 10 can
    be unfastened from the brackets 5, and the brackets 5 can be unfastened from the frame
    members 75; the guard rails 50, upright support members 10 and brackets 5 all being
    reusable. Alternatively, the brackets 5 can remain fastened to the frame members 75.
   The embodiments have been described by way of example only and modifications are
10  possible within the scope of the invention disclosed.
               Figures 9 to 11 illustrate another guard rail scaffolding system 101. The system can
   also be installed in respect of a building structure comprising frame members and floor
   joists, the building structure could, for example, be that of a house or a commercial building.
15  Each bracket 105 is preferably metallic and secured to respective frame members (not
   shown) via known securing means such as screws which extend through apertures 122
    (refer Figure 7). While the building frame members are often wooden, it is envisaged that
   the present system would also be adaptable to non-wooden frame members. For example,
   the brackets 5 could be secured to steel frame members via welding.
20
              With reference to Figures 6 to 8, each bracket 105 includes a substantially
    rectangular planar portion, which in the illustrated embodiment is formed as two parts of
    brackets 115a and 115b. The planar portion is securable to a frame member, in particular
   a long side face of the frame member.                    Each bracket 105 also includes side support
25  members 118, which define an opening 180 for slidingly receiving a bottom arm 140 of an
    upright support member 110 and provide a face which can rest against the frame member
   to strengthen the connection of the bracket 105 to the frame member and avoid
   disengagement upon extreme loading. The side support members 118 extend from and are
    perpendicular to sides of the planer portions 115a, 115b.

               Each of brackets 115a and 115b have an upturned portion with an aperture 130
   which can accommodate a fastener for securing the bracket 105 to the upright support
   member 110. In the illustrated example, the fastener isa spring-loaded pin 125 (see Figure
   6). Of course, other common fastening means (e.g. screws, bolts, welding) may be used
 5 to fasten an upright support member 110 to a corresponding bracket 105.
              While it is envisaged that the bracket 105 is substantially metallic and can be
   galvanised and/or formed of mild steel, it can of course be formed from other suitably
   strong and secure materials. As such, the bracket, which is generally a flush plate having
10 a square hollow section welded thereon, provides a simple and cheap connection point to
   which an upright support member 110 can be secured.
               Referring to Figures 9 10 11, each upright support member 110 comprises a support
   arm 135 extending upwardly from the bottom arm 140, the support arm 135 having one
15 or more supports 145 for supporting a wooden guard rail (not shown). In the depicted
   example, each support 145 is in the form of a surround, though could also be in the form
   of a flanged ledge for accommodating the guard rail. In this way, one or more guard rails
   can be supported by and extend between adjacent upright support members 110. It is
   envisaged that each guard rail can be fastened to corresponding upright support members
20 110 via common fasteners received in apertures 55. The fasteners may be screws or bolts,
   though could also be spring loaded bolts or other similar quick connecting fasteners. Of
   course, characteristics such as the positioning and configuration of the guard rails can be
   varied so as to optimise their ability to protect workers from falling from elevated heights.
25             It will be appreciated that wooden frame members which make up a building frame
   are often rectangular in cross-section and thus present two opposed narrower faces, each
   adjacent to two opposed wider faces. In these cases, it is preferred that each bracket 105
   is secured to the wider face of a respective frame member - the wider face typically defining
   an inner side of the building frame. Side support members 118 can then lie near or against
30 and generally alight with the narrower face of a respective frame member.

               In order to reduce the construction time required at the building site of the building
   structure, it is envisaged that the brackets 105 can each be secured to respective frame
   members before the frame members are delivered to the building site.
 5             In this way, once the frame members are delivered to the building site, their very

               It is also envisaged that each upright support member 110 can be secured to the
   pre-secured brackets prior to or after delivery of the frame members to the building site.
15 For example, each upright support member 110 could be connected to a respective bracket
   105 via a hinged connection. As such, once the frame members with pre-secured brackets
   105 and upright support members are erected at a building site, only the guard rails need
   to be installed to complete the guard rail scaffolding, thereby reducing the time required to
   erect a building frame and install a scaffolding system at a building site.
20
              Once the guard rail scaffolding system is no longer required, the guard rails can be
   unfastened from the upright support members 110, the upright support members 110 can
   be unfastened from the brackets 105, and the brackets 105 can be unfastened from the
   frame members; the guard rails, upright support members 110 and brackets 105 all being
25 reusable. Alternatively, the brackets 105 can remain fastened to the frame members.
              The embodiments have been described by way of example only and modifications
   are possible within the scope of the invention disclosed. For example, although the system
   has been described in relation to a building frame, those skilled in the art will appreciate
30 that the invention could also be used as fall protection for roof trusses.
