   Detailed Description
10 Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller arranged to electronically
   implement a game where upon a trigger condition being met
   an evaluation is conducted to determine how many game
   events are to be awarded. The trigger condition is a
15 defined combination of trigger symbols. The evaluation is
   performed by independently determining for each trigger
   symbol, a number of game events to be awarded.
   In an advantageous embodiment, the game events are game
20 rounds and the awarded number of game rounds sets an
   initial number of game rounds to be conducted based on
   initial designated symbols. During each game round symbols
   are selected for all symbol positions except where
   designated symbols have already been selected (or
25 specified by the initial designated symbols).       When a
   designated symbol is selected, the series of game rounds
   is extended by at least one game round and the designated
   symbol is added to those held in position for subsequent
   game rounds. At the conclusion of the game rounds, an
30 award is made based on the displayed designated symbols.
   General construction of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
35 a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
                                             9950986_1 (GHMalters) P87628.AU.3 6/02/18

                               -  9
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
 5 and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
10 such as by a gaming server;   or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
15 receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
20 and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
   the gaming system may operate in standalone gaming machine
   mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending
   on the game being played, operating conditions, and so on.
25 Other variations will be apparent to persons skilled in
   the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
   core components. At the broadest level, the core
30 components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
35 instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
                                               9950986_1 (GHMalters) P87628.AU.3 6/02/18

                                 - 10
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
 5 mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions             (e.g. to
   place a wager),   and one or more speakers 58.
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
10 player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
15 Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:              a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
20  (e.g. a PC) or a server.    That is a processor may be
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
   stored in memory    and generating outputs    (for example on
   the display).   Such processors are sometimes also referred
25 to as central processing units     (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
   integrated circuit    (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
   array   (FPGA).
30
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2.     The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
35 by a player.    A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
                                                 9950986_1 (GHMalters) P87628.AU.3 6/02/18

                               -  11
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.    Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
 5 reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
   having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module          (not
10 shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.    The player tracking
   device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
15 reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
   stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
20 the player marketing module.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.         Further
25 artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
30 The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
35 electromechanical device.    The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
                                               9950986_1 (GHMalters) P87628.AU.3 6/02/18

                               - 12
   type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
 5 different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
10 processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
   communication with the processor 102.     Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
15 memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output    (I/0) interface 105 for
20 communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
25 devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.           Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
30 In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107  (which provide a game play
   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
35 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a

   may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
 5 input device that enables the player to input game play
   instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
10 devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
   buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
15 communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
20 controller, central controller, server or database.                  In
   embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module - i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
25 communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.
   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.             The RAM
30 103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.             The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
35 integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.

   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be

   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
10 Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
15 simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
20 One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
25 and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
30 202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
35 and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot

   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.      A    loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
 5 In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.   With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
10 gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
15 that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
20 incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
25 licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
30 The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.

   plurality of different computers.    For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.    For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
 5 Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.   Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
10 terminals.
   Further detail of gaming system
   The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify
15 a wager and hence the win entitlement which will be
   evaluated for this play of the game and initiates a play
   of the game. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
   that a player's win entitlement will vary from game to
   game dependent on player selections. In most spinning reel
20 games, it is typical for the player's entitlement to be
   affected by the amount they wager and selections they make
    (i.e. the nature of the wager) . For example, a player's                   win
   entitlement may be based on how many lines they play in
   each game -  e.g. a minimum of one line up to the maximum
25 number of lines allowed by the game   (noting that not all
   permutations of win lines may be available for selection)
   and how much they wager per line.    Such win lines are
   typically formed by a combination of symbol display
   positions, one from each reel, the symbol display
30 positions being located relative to one another such that
   they form a line.
   In many games, the player's win entitlement is not
   strictly limited to the lines they have selected, for
35 example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
   player's selection of pay lines and are an inherent part
   of the win entitlement.
                                               9950986_1 (GHMalters) P87628.AU.3 6/02/18

                               - 17
    Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in other
    embodiments, the player may obtain a win entitlement by
    selecting a number of reels to play and an amount to wager
  5 per reel. Such games are marketed under the trade name
    "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd. The
    selection of the reel means that each displayed symbol of
    the reel can be substituted for a symbol at one or more
    designated display positions. In other words, all symbols
10  displayed at symbol display positions corresponding to a
    selected reel can be used to form symbol combinations with
    symbols displayed at a designated, symbol display
    positions of the other reels. For example, if there are
    five reels and three symbol display positions for each
15  reel such that the symbol display positions comprise three
    rows of five symbol display positions, the symbols
    displayed in the centre row are used for non-selected
    reels. As a result, the total number of ways to win is
    determined by multiplying the number of active display
20  positions of each reel, the active display positions being
    all display positions of each selected reel and the
    designated display position of the non-selected reels. As
    a result for five reels and fifteen display positions
    there are 243 ways to win.
25
    In other embodiments a player win entitlement may be
    affected by purchasing access to particular pay tables
    e.g. a first bet amount entitles the player to wins
    including cherries and a second amount entitles them to
30  wins including plums.
    In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
    shown implementing a number of modules based on program
    code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the
35  art will appreciate that one or more of the modules could
    be implemented in some other way, for example by a
    dedicated circuit.
                                              9950986_1 (GHMalters) P87628.AU.3 6/02/18

                              - 18
   These modules include the outcome generator 622 which
   operates in response to the player's operation of game
   play mechanism 56 to place a wager and initiate a play of
 5 the game and generates a game outcome which will then be
   evaluated by award evaluator 623. A symbol selector 622A
   operates to select symbols from a set of symbols specified
   by symbol data 641 using random number generator 621. The
   selected symbols are advised to the display controller 624
10 which causes them to be displayed on display 54 at a set
   of display positions.
   In the embodiment, the symbol selector 622A selects
   symbols for display from a plurality of symbol sets
15 corresponding to respective ones of a plurality of
   spinning reels. The symbol sets 641 specify a sequence of
   symbols for each reel such that the symbol selector 622A
   can select all of the symbols by selecting a stopping
   position in the sequence. In one example, three symbols of
20 each of five reels may be displayed such that symbols are
   displayed at fifteen display positions on display 54.                  It
   is known to use a probability table stored in memory 64 to
   vary the odds of a particular stop position being
   selected. Other techniques can be used to control the odds
25 of particular outcomes occurring to thereby control the
   return to player of the game.
   During each play of the game, the outcome evaluator 623
   evaluates the selected symbols relative to symbol pay
30 table 642.  The symbol pay table 642 defines what awards
   in credits will be made to the player for wins which
   correspond to the player's win entitlement.
   As indicated above, the symbol set 641 includes designated
35 symbols 641A which will satisfy a trigger condition if
   they occur.  Accordingly, during each play of the game, a
   trigger monitor 623A of the outcome evaluator 623
                                             9950986_1 (GHMalters) P87628.AU.3 6/02/18

                               - 19
   determines whether there are sufficient designated symbols
   to lead to the feature game being triggered.          In one
   example, 3,  4 or 5 of the designated symbol will result in
   a trigger.   Figure 6 also shows that the game rules may
 5 vary 644 from the base game to the feature game.               For
   example, the base rules may specify that a particular
   symbol acts as a WILD symbol that substitutes for other
   symbols whereas the feature game may specify an additional
   symbol acts as a substitute symbol as indicated by feature
10 game 644B.
   In the embodiment, once the trigger monitor 623A
   determines that a trigger condition has been met the
   outcome evaluator 623 causes the feature game controller
15 624 to commence action.   The feature game controller 624
   includes a game round determiner 624A.    The game round
   determiner 624A conducts a random determination to select
   from a set of available numbers a number of game rounds to
   award for each trigger symbol.    In one embodiment, the
20 available number of game rounds is 1 or 2 but in another
   embodiment the available number of game rounds could be,
   for example, 0,  1, 2, 3 and 4.   In the embodiment, each
   number is equally probable but it would be appreciated
   that in some embodiments one number may be weighted over
25 another.   Accordingly, for each designated symbol, the
   game round determiner 624A obtains a random number from
   random number generator 621 to determine which number of
   game rounds is to be awarded.    E.g. if the random number
   generator outputs numbers between 0 and 1,     a number from
30 0.01 to 0.50 = 1 free game and a number from 0.51 to 1.0 =
   2 free games.   In the embodiment, this number sets an
   initial number of game rounds.    To this end, the feature
   game controller includes a counter controller 624B which
   sets the number of game rounds to be conducted based on
35 the number determined by the game round determiner.                   For
   example, if there were three trigger symbols and the game
   round determiner 624A determined respectively that 2,                    2
                                               9950986_1 (GHMalters) P87628.AU.3 6/02/18

                              - 20
   and 1 game rounds should be conducted based on each
   trigger symbol, the total number of game rounds is
   initially set at 5 game rounds.
 5 After the initial number of game rounds has been
   determined, the feature game controller 624 causes outcome
   generator 622 to generate a first game round.         In this
   respect, the symbol selector includes a symbol holder 622B
   which holds each of the designated symbols at the position
10 at which they occurred during the triggering game.                The
   symbol selector 622A then selects further symbols for
   display by selecting new positions for each of the reels
   to stop.  In the embodiment, the reels specified by the
   symbol set 641 for use in the feature game are the same as
15 in the base game.  However, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that as is known in some other games, the
   reel sets may be modified, for example by adding or
   substituting symbols for use in the feature game.
   Accordingly, it will be understood that where symbols are
20 held, symbols are selected for each position other than
   where the held symbol is displayed on display 54.               That
   is, that each held symbol supplants the symbol which would
   have been selected for that position.
25 In each game round of the feature game, the outcome
   evaluator 623 evaluates the selected symbols based on the
   symbol pay table 642 but further determines whether any
   other designated symbols have occurred with designated
   symbol monitor 623B.  Any designated symbols are advised
30 to the counter controller 624B as the counter controller
   624B is arranged only to decrease the number of remaining
   game rounds upon no designated symbols occurring in a
   specific game round.  That is, each time a designated
   symbol is monitored by the designated symbol monitor 623B
35 the counter controller extends the series of game rounds
   by maintaining the counter at the same value.         In the
   embodiment, the counter is displayed above the reel so
                                             9950986_1 (GHMalters) P87628.AU.3 6/02/18

                              - 21
   that the player can see how many game rounds remain.
   It will be appreciated that the number of designated
   symbols may increase during the game rounds.         Once the
 5 counter controller 624B determines that the last game
   round of the feature game has been conducted        (i.e. the
   game round counter 646 has reduced to 0 by the counter
   controller), it causes the designated symbol evaluator
   623C to conduct an evaluation of the final display of
10 designated symbols based on held symbol pay table 643 to
   determine an award to make.   Pay table 643 specifies
   different awards in credits based on the number of
   designated symbols which have occurred.   In one example,
   the pay table 643 is as follows:

   It will be appreciated from the above example, that in the
   example a feature can be triggered with 2, 3, 4, or 5
 5 designated symbols and that there are 5 reels each having
   4 symbols that are selected during each play of the game.
   The awards made to the player are added to a win meter of
   meter 645 and then transferred to a credit meter upon the
   player initiating a further play of the game and/or
10 deciding to cash out.
   In some embodiments, an eligibility criteria may be
   applied for the player to be eligible for the feature
   game, for example that the player has made a certain sized
15 wager, made an ante bet, selected all win lines, played
   sufficient games, or the player is a member of a loyalty
                                               9950986_1 (GHMalters) P87628.AU.3 6/02/18

   program.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate from the above
   that the base game is a part of the game which is carried
 5 out each time the player makes a wager, typically
   irrespective of the wager, whereas the feature game will
   only be carried out occasionally for example if a
   condition is met such as a trigger occurring or if an ante
   bet is placed (depending on the specific embodiment).
10
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a feature
   game involves some additional element of game play which
   usually only occurs when a trigger condition is met. Types
   of feature games include: those where a series of free
15 game events are awarded such as free games or re-spins
   (where some reels are held while others are re-spun);
   games where the symbols on the reel are changed; and
   "second screen" games where game play is totally different
   to the base game, for example where the player makes
20 selections in a "pick a box type" game. In the above
   embodiment, the game events that are awarded based on the
   trigger symbols are game rounds. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that in other embodiments, the awarded
   game events will correspond to the feature game, such as a
25 number of picks in a pick.
   While the above embodiment describes a trigger which leads
   to an advantageous determination of an initial number of
   game rounds, in other embodiments an initial number of
30 game rounds may be awarded in some different manner, for
   example the number of game rounds may be fixed. In such
   embodiments, the trigger event may take a different form.
   For example, the trigger event may be caused by another
   connected system, based on turnover, based on a random
35 evaluation, etc.
   In spinning reel game, a game round involves at least one
                                             9950986_1 (GHMalters) P87628.AU.3 6/02/18

                               - 24
   of the reels being "spun" -   e.g. new symbols of the reels
   are selected for display at least some of the display
   positions and the reel is virtually spun to a stop.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that there may
 5 be more than one game round in a play of a gaming machine
   such as is the case when a series of free spins is
   awarded. The outcome of a game round may be no win, a win
    (for example from a winning combination of symbols),                  a
   contribution towards a win accrued over a plurality of
10 game rounds, a trigger condition occurring etc. Typically,
   a win will result in some form of award being made such as
   an award of credits. Such an award may never actually be
   physically received by a player. For example, many gaming
   systems provide a player with a double or nothing gamble
15 feature, where the player can double or forfeit their
   credits before commencing another play of the game or
   cashing out. Further, as credits are fungible, once
   credits have been added to the credit meter it is not
   possible to distinguish between credits which exist
20 because the player has input cash or the like and credits
   resulting from an award.
   Figure 7 shows a method 700 of an embodiment of the
   invention.   The method involves receiving a play
25 instruction 705, conducting a base game 710 and
   determining whether a trigger has occurred 715. Upon the
   trigger occurring, the method involves separately
   determining a number of game rounds for each symbol in
   the trigger 720 to produce a total number of game rounds
30 that is set as the counter 725 for the game rounds.
   The method then involves conducting a series of game
   rounds with held symbols. Each game round involves
   determining if a new designated symbol appears. When no
35 new designated symbol appears, the counter is decremented
   750 and 750 and the game round is evaluated 755.               Upon a
   new designated symbol appearing it is determined whether a
                                               9950986_1 (GHMalters) P87628.AU.3 6/02/18

                                - 25
   maximum number of symbols has occurred 770. If not, the
   designated symbols are held 775, the counter is
   decremented   750 and the game round is evaluated 755.The
   method continues until ether the counter reaches zero 760
 5 or a maximum number of designated symbols is reached 770
   after which an award is made based on the final number of
   designated symbols 765.
   Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
10 above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
   electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
   executing program code such as in the above description of
   a game controller. In this respect, in the above
15 description certain steps are described as being carried
   out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
   appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
   sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
   implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
20 programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
   such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
   may need to compute several values and compare those
   values.
25 As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
   (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
30 a data signal   (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server). Further different parts of the program code can
   be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
   appreciate that program code provides a series of
35 instructions executable by the processor.

   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
