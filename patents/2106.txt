[0002]       It is convenient to carry personal items, such as mobile phones, credit cards,
and keys, with you when exercising or for other lifestyle activities. Exercise or leisure
clothing do not necessarily have pockets which are suited to carry the items. Waist belts or
light backpacks can be used to carry the items, but these may be cumbersome.
                                             Summary
[0003]       In one exemplary embodiment, the present disclosure is directed to an
accessory for carrying items on a garment. The accessory includes a pouch for holding the
items. The accessory includes a securing flap. The accessory includes a flexible spine
intermediate the pouch and the securing flap, which joins the pouch and the securing flap
in a bifolding arrangement. One or more magnets are fixed along at least one of the pouch
and the securing flap. The magnets magnetically attach the securing flap to the pouch
when the pouch and the securing flap are folded together.
[0004]       Both the pouch and the securing flap may include magnets. The magnets may
be captured in pockets at lower corners of the pouch and the securing flap, respectively.
[0005]       The magnets may be located at any position on or in the pouch and the securing
flap, respectively. Preferably the magnets are located along lateral side regions of the
pouch and the securing flap.
[0006]       The spine may have a width defined between two parallel stitch lines. The spine
may be between one and five centimetres wide. The spine may be of a flexible material.

                                                 2
The spine may have a further stitch line between the two parallel stitch lines. The further
stitch line may be parallel to the two parallel stitch lines.
[0007]      The pouch may include a slide fastener for providing access to a pocket defined
by the pouch.
[0008]      The pouch, spine and securing flap may be formed from a single panel of fabric
which is folded and stitched to define the pouch, spine and securing flap.
[0009]      The pouch, spine and securing flap may be formed from two or more layers of
material which overlay each other and are stitched together to define the pouch, spine and
securing flap.

accessory for carrying items, that includes a pouch for holding the items. The pouch
includes a slide fastener extending between lateral sides of the pouch for providing access
to a pocket defined by the pouch. The accessory includes a securing flap joined to the
pouch in a bifolding arrangement. The accessory includes one or more magnets along at
least one of the pouch and the securing flap that magnetically attaches the securing flap to
the pouch when the pouch and the securing flap are folded together.
[0011]      In another exemplary embodiment, the accessory includes a reflective material
on an outside of the pouch. The reflective material may be printed or fixed to the pouch.
[0012]      In another exemplary embodiment, the pouch includes a pocket for holding the
items. The accessory further includes one or more internal pockets within the pocket of the
pouch, the one or more internal pockets being smaller than the pocket of the pouch.
[0013]      In another exemplary embodiment, the pouch includes a headphone cord hole in
a panel of the pouch for threading a headphone cord through the panel and into the pocket.
[0014]      In another exemplary embodiment, the one or more magnets are captured in
one or more closed pockets in at least one of the pouch and the securing flap. The
accessory includes a thermofusible fabric along a seam of the one or more closed pockets.

                               Detailed Description of the Drawings
[0032]       Alternative embodiments of the disclosure will be apparent to those of ordinary
skill in the art from consideration of the specification. It is intended that the specification
and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the
disclosure being indicated by the claims which follow. It will be understood that the term
"comprising" is intended to have a broad, open meaning and not limited to a particular
embodiment.
[0033]       Referring to Figs. 1 to 4, an accessory 10 includes a pouch 20, a securing flap
50, and a spine 70 intermediate pouch 20 and securing flap 50. Accessory 10 is adapted
to be releasably secured to a garment, more specifically to be carried on a pair of pants.
[0034]        Pouch 20 includes a front panel 22 shown in Fig. 2 and a back panel 24 shown
in Fig. 3. In one embodiment, front panel 22 and back panel 24 are a unitary piece of
material which is folded to form a free edge 28 at a lower end of pouch 20. In another
embodiment, front panel 22 and back panel 24 are two layers of fabric which are stitched
together. Front panel 22 and back panel 24 are stitched together along lateral sides 26 of
pouch 20 to form a pocket 30.

                                                 5
[0035]      Pocket 30 is dimensioned to receive personal items. Specifically, pocket 30 is
dimensioned to receive and carry a phone. In one embodiment, pocket 30 may, for
example, be between 12cm and 18cm wide, for example 16cm wide. Pocket 30 may, for
example, be between 6cm and 10cm deep, for example 8cm deep. Pocket 30 may be
sized for carrying particular items, such as a phone or a tool.
[0036]      Pouch 20 includes a slide fastener in the form of a zipper 32. Zipper 32 extends
across the full width of front panel 22, between lateral sides 26. Zipper 32 provides
selective access to pocket 30 of pouch 20.
[0037]      Zipper 32 includes a slider 34 and zipper teeth 36. Zipper 32 meshes teeth 36
together or separates teeth 36 depending on the direction of movement of slider 34. Zipper
32 is opened to allow access to pocket 30 for placing items in the pocket or retrieving items
from the pocket.
[0038]      As shown in Fig. 2, pouch 20 includes strips 38 of reflective material on either
side of zipper 32. Pouch 20 may include other pieces of reflective material or coating on
front panel 22 of pouch 20, for example heat transfer reflective tape fixed to front panel 22.
[0039]      Referring to Figs. 2 and 3, front panel 22 and back panel 24 of pouch 20 are
stitched together along stitch line 40. Stitch line 40 extends between lateral sides 26.
Stitch line 40 is a top stitch which goes through both front panel 22 and back panel 24. An
upper fabric tape extension of zipper 32 is fixed between the front panel 22 and back panel
24 by stitch line 40. A lower fabric tape extension of zipper 32 is stitched to the inside of
front panel 22 by a stitch line 41. Stitch line 41 is a top stitch which goes through front
panel 22 only.
[0040]      Pouch 20 has two closed pockets 42 at its lower corners for holding or capturing
magnets (not shown).       Closed pockets 42 are formed between front panel 22 and back
panel 24. The pockets 42 are stitched closed. Closed pockets 42 are generally
rectangular to accommodate magnets which are block-shaped.
[0041]      Securing flap 50 includes an inner panel 52 shown in Fig. 3, and an outer panel
54 shown in Fig. 2. Inner panel 52 and outer panel 54 overlap. In one embodiment, inner
panel 52 and outer panel 54 are of a unitary piece of material which is folded to form a free

                                                  6
edge 58. In another embodiment, inner panel 52 and outer panel 54 are two layers of
fabric which are stitched together. Inner panel 52 and outer panel 54 are stitched together
along lateral sides 56 of securing flap 50.
[0042]       Inner panel 52 and outer panel 54 are stitched together along a stitch line 60
which extends between lateral sides 56. Stitch line 60 is a top stitch which goes through
outer panel 54 and inner panel 52.
[0043]       Securing flap 50 has two closed pockets 62 at its lower corners for holding
magnets. The magnets of securing flap 50 are the same as the magnets of pouch 20.            In
another embodiment, pouch 20 may have ferromagnetic formations, such as blocks of
steel, attracted by the magnets of securing flap 50, or vice versa.
[0044]        The magnets of accessory 10 each have a strength grade of, for example, N48
or N52. It will be appreciated that any suitable strength grade may be selected depending
on factors like the thickness of the fabric or the intended purpose of accessory 10.
[0045]       Spine 70 is defined between stitch line 40 and stitch line 60. Stitch lines 40 and
60 are parallel to each other. Spine 70 has a width measured between stitch line 40 and
stitch line 60. Spine 70 may be between 1cm and 5cm wide, for example 2.5cm wide.
[0046]       Spine 70 is of a flexible material. Stitch line 40 forms a crease which encourages
or promotes folding of pouch 20 with respect to spine 70. Similarly, stitch line 60 forms a
crease which encourages or promotes folding of securing flap 50 with respect to spine 70.
Having a separate crease for each of pouch 20 and securing flap 50 to promote folding
makes for easy bifolding of accessory 10. Bifolding means that pouch 20 and securing flap
50 are able to fold or hinge relative to each other about spine 20. Spine 70 maintains a
slight gap between pouch 20 and securing flap 50.
[0047]       Spine 70 includes two overlapping layers of material which are stitched together
by stitch lines 40 and 60.
[0048]       Accessory 10 has a continuous stitch line 76 spaced from the outer edge of
accessory 10 to form a hem 78. Stitch line 76 is a top stitch which goes through both

                                                 7
layers of fabric of accessory 20. Hem 78 may receive piping or other stiffening formations
to stiffen the sides of pouch 20 and securing flap 50.
[0049]       Figs. 5 and 6 show two methods of constructing accessory 10. It will be
appreciated that these methods are exemplary only, many other methods using different
panels and stitching may be used to construct accessory 10.
[0050]       Referring to Fig. 5, accessory 10 is constructed of a single panel 90 of material
which is folded to form pouch 20, securing flap 50 and spine 70. Panel 90 is generally
rectangular. A section 92 at one end of panel 90 is folded over to form front panel 22 and
back panel 24 of pouch 20. A section 94 at the other end of panel 90 is folded over, in the
same direction as section 92, to form inner panel 52 and outer panel 54 of securing flap 50.
The folded over sections 92, 94 are then stitched to form pouch 20, securing flap 50 and
spine 70 as described above.
[0051]       Panel 90 may be of neoprene (polychloroprene) material. Panel 90 may be
between 1.5mm and 3mm thick, for example approximately 2mm thick. The neoprene
material conforms to the body shape of the wearer, which makes accessory 10 less prone
to jostling when worn during exercise. The neoprene material is breathable, which is an
advantage when exercising. Panel 90 may also be of any other suitable material, including
leather, faux leather, nylon, or canvas.
[0052]       In another embodiment shown in Fig. 6, accessory 10 is constructed from two
layers of material, a front layer 100 and rear layer 102, which are overlaid and stitched
together.
[0053]       Front layer 100 is a single panel of material which includes front panel 22, outer
panel 54 and one layer of spine 70, as described above. Front layer 100 is a panel of solid
stretch scuba knit fabric. Scuba knit fabric is a double knit fabric of finely spun polyester
fibres. Front layer 100 may be between 1.5mm and 3mm thick, for example approximately
2.2mm thick. Front layer 100 may also be of any other suitable material, including leather,
faux leather, nylon, or canvas.
[0054]       Rear layer 102 is a single panel of material which includes back panel 24, inner
panel 52 and the other layer of spine 70, as described above.

                                                8
[0055]       Front layer 100 and rear layer 102 are stitched together along their periphery
and additionally stitched with stitch lines as described above. Front layer 100 is then cut to
insert zipper 32. The stitch lines may use top stitches, zigzag, flatlock, overlock, chain, or
any other suitable stitches.
[0056]      Magnets 18 are captured in closed pockets 42 and 62 when stitching front layer
100 and rear layer 102 together.
[0057]       Rear layer 102 may include a number of internal pockets 110, as shown in Figs.
7a - 7c. Internal pockets 110 are located within pocket 30. Internal pockets 110 are
formed of a panel 112 of material which is stitched to rear layer 102. Internal pockets 110
have mouth openings which are generally aligned with zipper 32.
[0058]      A person wearing accessory 10 may choose to put an item in one of the internal
pockets 110 within pocket 30 of pouch 20.
[0059]      The internal pockets 110 may be of varying size and configuration as shown in
Figs. 7a to 7b. All of the internal pockets 110 are smaller than pocket 30 formed when
front layer is stitched to rear layer 102.
[0060]       Edges of some of internal pockets 110 are stitched to rear panel 102 by the
stitch lines which stitch front panel 100 and rear panel 102 together.
[0061]       Fig. 8 shows accessory 10 attached to a rigid panel 8. Magnets 18 are arranged
or positioned on pouch 20 and securing flap 50 to be opposite each other when pouch 20
and securing flap 50 are folded together. Magnets 18 are attracted to each other in an
arrangement wherein the panel 8 is clamped between the magnets of pouch 20 and the
magnets of securing flap 50. Spine 70 bridges across panel 8.
[0062]       Figs. 9 and 10 show the attachment of accessory 10 to a pair of pants or shorts
120. Shorts 120 have a waistband 122.
[0063]       Pouch 20 and securing flap 50 are folded open about spine 70 by separating
magnets 18 in pouch 20 from magnets 18 in flap 50. Securing flap 50 is then inserted on
the inside of the shorts 110, between the wearer and the shorts. Pouch 20 hangs outside

                                              9
shorts 120, from spine 70. Spine 70 rests on waistband 122. Waistband 122 is received
between pouch 20 and flap 50.
[0064]      Pouch 20 is secured to shorts 120 by hanging from spine 70 and the magnets
clamping shorts 120 between pouch 20 and securing flap 50.
[0065]      Accessory 10 may also be secured to other garments, such as a shirt or jacket.
[0066]      Zipper 32 provides convenient and secure access to pocket 30 of pouch 20.
The extension of zipper 32 parallel to spine 70 provides easy for easy operation of zipper
32 by the wearer. The wearer pulls slider 34 in a direction across his/her waist, which is a
natural direction of movement, especially while walking or running. Other means for
closing pouch 20, such as hook-and-loop fasteners (Velcro) or snap fasteners may also be
used. Zipper 32 is preferred due to its simple single-handed operation and longevity.
Hook-and-loop fasteners are prone to wear out or foul up.
[0067]      Accessory 10 may commonly be worn by a person during exercise. It is
common for persons exercising to want to listen to their own music using headphones
plugged into their phone or music player via a headphone cable. The headphone cable
may extend into pocket 30, between separated rows of teeth 36 by drawing zipper 32
slightly open. One drawback of zipper 32 is that teeth 36 may wear or cut the headphone
cable. For this reason, the embodiment of accessory 10 as depicted in Fig. 11 includes a
headphone cable outlet hole 46 in pouch 20. Headphone cable outlet hole 46 extends
through front panel 22 into pocket 30.
[0068]      Headphone cable outlet hole 46 is surrounded by a rip stop reinforcement
formation 48. Rip stop reinforcement formation 48 is stitched to panel 22. Rip stop
reinforcement formation 48 has a central opening to provide passage to hole 46. Hole 46
may be covered by segmented portions of front panel 22, which part when threading a
headphone cable through hole 46.
[0069]      Accessory 10 may include fusing fabric 130 along the outer seams, and
specifically along the seams adjacent the magnets 18. Fig. 12 shows fusing material
around one magnet 18 at a corner of pouch 20. Fuse fabric 130 aids in strengthening the
seams and material around the magnets 18. Fuse fabric 130 strengthens pockets 42 in

                                                 10
which magnets 18 are received. Pockets 42 require strengthening as separating pouch 20
from securing flap 50 effectively tries to tear magnets 18 out of the pockets.
[0070]      Fusing, or interfacing, works by applying heat to the fuse fabric which melts a
glue of the fuse fabric, and in turn bonds the fuse fabric to the material panels. The fuse
fabric may be in the form of a thermofusible web.
[0071]     Alternatively, or in addition, to fusing fabric 130, accessory 10 may include a
patches of material to strengthen the areas holding magnets 18. The patches may fold
around edges of panel 20 and securing flap 50 to strengthen the seam and fabric around
pockets 42 and 62. The patches may be of a suitably strong but thin material.
[0072]     Spine 70 provides space to accommodate the waistband 112. Without spine 70,
pouch 20 and flap 50 would tend to diverge from where they are joined together, due to the
waistband intruding in the spaced between the pouch 20 and flap 50. Spine 70 allows the
pouch 20 and flap 50 to better conform to the shape of the pants during exercise.
[0073]     The design of accessory 10 makes it reversible, so that pouch 20 and flap 50
are folded in the opposite direction as shown in Fig. 1. Zipper 32 will then face flap 50.
[0074]     The features described with respect to one embodiment may be applied to other
embodiments, or combined with, or interchanged with, the features of other embodiments
without departing from the scope of the present invention.
[0075]     Other embodiments of the disclosure will be apparent to those skilled in the art
