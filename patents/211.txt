              INSTRUMENT FOR ANALYTICAL SAMPLE PREPARATION
                                    Related Application
[0001] This application is related to patent application filed concurrently herewith for
Rapid Sample Preparation for Analytical Analysis Using Dispersive Energized Extraction
claiming priority from US patent application serial number 15/644920 and patent
application  _ filed concurrently herewith for Rapid Energized Dispersive Solid Phase
Extraction (SPE) for Analytical Analysis claiming priority from US patent application
serial number 15/644950.
                                        Background
[0002] The reference to prior art in this specification is not and should not be taken as an
acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that the referenced prior art forms part of the
common general knowledge in Australia or in any other country.
[0003] The present disclosure relates to analytical chemistry, and in particular relates to
sample preparation for molecular analysis.
[0004] In order to carry out molecular analysis (the task of identifying one or more
compounds in a sample) of any product, a sample of the product must be in such a form
that it can be easily analyzed by chromatography, spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy and/or
nuclear magnetic resonance instrumentation
[0005] Because these analytical instruments require substantially pure isolated analytes,
some intermediate steps, generally referred to as "sample preparation", must be carried
out to isolate the compounds of interest from the sample matrix in which they might be
found and prepare them for analysis by instrumentation.
[0006] The task of identifying one or more compounds in a sample-presents an
enormously larger set of possibilities and challenges related to sample preparation. The
number of "naturally occurring" compounds (those produced by plants or animals) is
immeasurably large, and the capabilities of modern organic and inorganic synthesis have
generated-figuratively or literally-a similar number of synthetic compounds.
[0007] There is tremendous interest in identification or quantitative measurement for
compounds of interest as it relates to industrial processes, and for environmental testing
for contaminants in waste water, soil, and air.
                                              1

[0008] Even a small group of recognizable representative samples would include pesticides
in food, other synthetic chemicals in food (antibiotics, hormones, steroids), synthetic
compositions (benzene, toluene, refined hydrocarbons) in soil, and undesired compositions
in everyday items (e.g., Bisphenol-A ("BPA") in polycarbonate bottles and other plastic food
packaging.
[0009] In general extraction has been a main form of sample preparation; i.e., drawing one
or more compounds of interest from a sample by mixing the sample with a solvent into
which the desired compound(s) will be extracted from the sample so that it can be
measured by an analytical technique.
[0010] For several generations (and continuing to date), sample preparation in the form of
extraction has been carried out by the well-understood Soxhlet method which was invented
in the 19th century.      In the Soxhlet technique, a single portion of solvent circulates
repeatedly through a sample matrix until extraction is complete. To the extent the Soxhlet
method has an advantage, it allows an extraction to continue on its own accord for as long
as the boiling flask is heated and the condenser is cold.
[0011] This method of extraction can take hours to completely extract the compounds of
interest. Other concerns of safety from flammable solvents, hazardous waste and
breakable glassware are significant drawbacks to this method.
[0012] Another commonly known extraction          method uses ultra-sonication;    i.e., the
irradiation of a liquid sample with ultrasonic (>20 kHz) waves resulting in agitation.       .
Although ultra-sonication has an advantage of speeding up the extraction process the
disadvantages are that it is a labor intensive, manual process and uses large amounts of
solvents.
[0013] In more recent years analytical scale microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) has
been utilized. MAE uses microwave energy to heat solvents in contact with a sample in
order to partition analytes from the sample matrix into the solvent. The main advantage
of MAE is the ability to rapidly heat the sample solvent mixture. When using closed
pressurized-vessels the extraction can be performed at elevated temperatures that
accelerate the extraction of the compounds of interest from the sample matrix. MAE
accelerates the extraction process, but has its disadvantages as well. In the microwave
heating process typically a polar solvent is needed to provide dipole rotation and ionic
conduction through reversals of dipoles and displacement of charged ions present in the
                                             2

solute and the solvent, limiting non-polar solvent use. MAE uses expensive, high-pressure
vessels that do not provide a means of filtering the extract, and they must be cooled before
pressure can be released.
[0014] In the 1990's automated apparatuses for the extraction of analytes were developed.
These apparatuses incorporated solvent extraction in pressurized cells under elevated
temperatures and pressures and are referred to as "Pressurized Fluid Extraction" ("PFE")
or "Accelerated Solvent Extraction" ("ASE").      PFE has shown to be similar to Soxhlet
extraction, except that the solvents are at elevated temperatures where they exhibit high
extraction properties.   This procedure was first developed by Dionex (Richter DE et al.,
Anal Chem 1996, 68, 1033). One such PFE automated extraction system (Dionex ASE) is
commercially available.
[0015] PFE was initially used for environmental contaminants (EPA Method 3545,
herbicides, pesticides, hydrocarbons) in soil, sediments and animal tissues but has
expanded to use in foods, pharmaceutical products and other biological samples.
[0016] PFE provides an efficient extraction, but still has not overcome the major
bottlenecks associated with the many steps necessary to prepare a sample for analysis.
PFE utilizes multiple-component cells and many steps. The cells are tightly packed with
the sample and other packing material to eliminate any void areas in the cell, enhance
separation, and avoid channeling.      Preparing a cell for analysis can typically take 15
minutes. The cells are pre-pressurized at pressures up to 1500 psi (about 10342 kPa) and
heated up to 200'C prior to adding the solvent. Extraction is based on chromatographic
principles to force the hot solvent through the column.      Cycle times can take up to 20
minutes and the requirements of high pressure lead to secondary disadvantages with
respect to cost and maintenance.
[0017] Newer PSE or ASE techniques attempt to address some of these difficulties, but
still require that the cells be tightly packed, adding to the complexity and overall time
required for each extraction.
[0018] Sample preparation, although having developed over the years, nevertheless
remains the major bottleneck in molecular analysis. Accordingly, although the Soxhlet,
Ultrasonication, MAE and PFE techniques have their advantages, each remains relatively
time-consuming. As a result, when multiple samples are required or desired to provide
necessary or desired information, the time required to carry out any given extraction-based
                                              3

molecular preparation step reduces the number of samples that can be prepared in any
given amount of time, thus reducing the amount of information available in any given time
interval.   To the extent that measurements are helpful or necessary in a continuous
process, this represents a longer gap between samples or before an anomalous or
troublesome result can be identified.
[0019] In recent decades, advances in liquid chromatography have led to analogous uses of
packed columns in a technique referred to as solid phase extraction ("SPE"). Originally,
chromatography was used to separate fractions in mixed samples for analytical purposes,
and indeed it still serves this purpose very well.
[0020] In SPE, the chromatography technique is modified to extract an analyte from a
matrix. Nevertheless, SPE fundamentally remains a liquid chromatography technique in
which molecules spread out (travel at different speeds) within a column based on their
polarity, the particle size and polarity of the packed column (stationary phase), the polarity
of the flowing liquid (mobile phase), the size (length and diameter) of the column and
specific factors such as "hold-up volume," "linear velocity," and "flow rate." See, e.g.,
Arsenault, J.C. 2012. Beginner's Guide to SPE. Milford MA: Waters Corporation.
(Arsenault 2012).
[0021] Although SPE is useful, it has limiting characteristics, some of which include the
following factors. First, a proper description of SPE is "liquid-solid phase extraction"
because the sample matrix that holds the analyte is almost always a liquid.
[0022] Second, because SPE is essentially a liquid chromatography technique, it requires
either column packing steps or a new column for each test, along with a potential pre
swelling step depending upon the material selected or required for the stationary
phase.   SPE typically requires different methods and manipulative steps for different
analytes.
[0023] Third a more deliberate (slower) flow through the packed column tends to produce
better separation among the fractions. Thus, in a very real sense slower SPE is better than
faster SPE.
[0024] Finally, if an additional driving force (i.e., in addition to simple gravity flow) is
required to move solvent through the SPE column, an external liquid or gas pump, or a
centrifuge, or a vacuum pull must be incorporated, which in turn increases, to some lesser
or greater amount, the complexity of the technique and any supporting systems.
                                                 4

[0025] More recently, a dispersive solid phase extraction ("dSPE") method referred to as
"Quechers" or "QuEChERS" ("quick-easy-cheap-effective-rugged-safe")           has become a
standard for extraction preparation of molecular samples. Dispersive SPE addresses some
of the disadvantages of SPE, but still requires an extraction step, the adjustment of pH
with an appropriate ionic salt, is labor-intensive (even if advantageous compared to other
methods), and requires two separate centrifuge steps.
[0026] Quechers is in many ways less complex than Soxhlet extraction, but still requires a
multi-step process. In the literature, this is sometimes called a "three step process" (e.g.,
Paragraph 0153 of U.S. Patent Application Publication No. <removed-apn>5), but in reality
Quechers requires at least the following: homogenization of the matrix that contains the
analyte of interest; adding extraction solvent; hand agitation; buffering; a second agitation
step; a centrifuge separation step; decanting; dispersive solid phase extraction ("dSPE")
clean up; a second centrifuge separation step; and decanting the supernatant liquid
following the centrifuge step.
[0027] In addition to the multi-step handling and transfer of the solvent, the sample, and
the various mixtures, each of the centrifuge steps takes a recommended five minutes; so
that the full Quechers sample preparation takes at least about 15-20 minutes.
[0028] Accordingly, although the Soxhlet, SPE, and Quechers (dSPE) methods have their
advantages, each remains relatively time-consuming. As a result, when multiple samples
are required or desired to provide necessary or desired information, the time required to
carry out any given extraction-based molecular preparation step reduces the number of
samples that can be prepared in any given amount of time, thus reducing the amount of
information available in any given time interval. To the extent that measurements are
helpful or necessary in a continuous process, this represents a longer gap between samples
or before an anomalous or troublesome result can be identified.
[0029] In summary, among other disadvantages current sample preparation techniques
are slow, require a large number of separate steps, use excess solvent, are difficult to
automate, and operate under high liquid pressure.
[0030] Accordingly, a need continues to exist for efficient rapid extraction-based molecular
preparation techniques.
[0031] In the present description and claims, the term "comprising" shall be understood to
have a broad meaning similar to the term "including" and will be understood to imply the
                                              5

inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of
any other integer or step or group of integers or steps.     This definition also applies to
variations on the term "comprising" such as "comprise" and "comprises".
                                          Summary
[0032] In one aspect a combination for solvent extraction is disclosed. The combination
includes a heated, pressure-sealed reaction chamber, a sample cup in the reaction
chamber, the sample cup including one open filtered end and a mouth opposite the open
filtered end, an extraction sample in the sample cup, and a liquid extraction solvent inside
the sample cup and outside the sample cup between the exterior of the sample cup and the
interior of the reaction chamber.
[0033] In one aspect, an instrument for extraction based molecular sample preparation
and related processes is disclosed.     The instrument includes a thermally conductive
pressure resistant heating chamber with a pressure resistant chamber closure. A sample
cup is positioned in the thermally conductive pressure resistant heating chamber and for
heating liquids and solids together in the sample cup.       A liquid delivery inlet fixture
communicates with the thermally conductive pressure resistant heating chamber for
delivering liquids (solvent) from a supply to the sample cup in the thermally conductive
pressure resistant heating chamber. A gas delivery head in communication with the
thermally conductive pressure resistant heating chamber is positioned at or near the
bottom of the sample cup for delivering an inert gas from a supply to the sample cup to
agitate the contents of the sample cup. A chiller is in liquid communication with the
sample cup in the thermally conductive pressure resistant heating chamber for receiving
heated liquids from the thermally conductive pressure resistant heating chamber when
the chamber is opened to atmospheric pressure.
[0034] In yet another aspect, there is disclosed an instrument for extraction based
molecular sample preparation and related processes that includes a plurality of sample
cups and a plurality of collection vials carried in a common rack, a robot arm for moving
one of the sample cups from (to and from in practice) the rack into an opened pressure
chamber, a pressure resistant chamber closure that reciprocates vertically to open and
close the pressure chamber, a liquid inlet fixture for delivering liquids to the pressure
chamber when the pressure chamber is closed, a heater for raising the temperature of
                                              6

liquids in the pressure chamber when the pressure chamber is closed, a gas inlet fixture
for delivering an agitating gas flow to the pressure chamber when the pressure chamber
is closed, and a drain for releasing liquids from the pressure chamber under pressure
generated by delivered heated liquids in the chamber.
[0035] In yet another aspect, a sample preparation instrument that includes a sample cup
with one opened filtered end and a mouth opposite the filtered end is disclosed. A reaction
chamber surrounds the sample cup so that the reaction chamber and the sample cup define
open jacket portions between the interior surfaces of the reaction chamber and exterior
surfaces of the sample cup. The reaction chamber includes a drain floor in communication
with the opened filtered end of the sample cup, a pressure sealing lid over the mouth of the
sample cup, a first solvent inlet from the pressure sealing lid to the interior of the sample
cup; and a second solvent inlet from the drain floor into the reaction chamber. A reaction
chamber heater is in thermal contact with the reaction chamber so that solvent can be
added from both of the first and second solvent inlets into the sample cup and from the
second solvent inlet into the jacket portions so that the heater can heat the reaction
chamber and solvent in the jacket portions, and so that heated solvent in the jacket
portions can heat the sample cup and heat solvents and extraction samples inside the
sample cup and so that solvent from the second inlet can enter the sample cup through the
open filtered end and favorably agitate extraction solvents and samples in the sample cup.
[0036] The foregoing and other objects and advantages of various aspects of the disclosure
and the manner in which the same are accomplished will become clearer based on the
followed detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

                                      Detailed Description
[0061] In general, terms are used herein in a manner that is clear from the context of this
specification, or as explicitly stated, or using standard English dictionary definitions.
[0062] The term "solvent" is used in its well understood chemical sense; e.g., "a substance
capable of dissolving another substance (solute) to form a uniformly dispersed mixture
(solution) at the molecular or ionic size level." The adjective "organic" is used in its well
understood sense to "embrace all compounds of carbon" other than certain small molecule
                                                8

combinations of carbon with oxygen, sulfur, and metals, and in some cases halogens. See,
Lewis, Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary, 15th Edition, 2007, John Wiley & Sons
[0063] The "sample matrix" is the material to be tested for the presence and optionally the
amount of analyte.
[0064] The "analyte" is the molecular compound of interest.
[0065] The "solvent extract" is the solution of analyte in a solvent following extraction.
[0066] The "sample cup" is the container for the sample matrix and the solvent.
[0067] The "collection vessel" is the container that collects the solvent extract following
cooling.
[0068] A "liquid sample matrix" is a sample in which the analyte is present in a liquid
rather than a solid matrix.
[0069] Figure 1 is a front perspective view illustrating a number of elements of an
exemplary instrument broadly designated at 30 for extraction based molecular sample
preparation and related processes.        Figure 1 shows that the instrument includes an
actuator housing 31, a chamber housing 32, a main housing 33, a base housing 34, and a
base plate 35 resting on a plurality of feet 36. The illustrated embodiment also carries a
name tag 41.
[0070] Figure 1 also illustrates portions of a thermally conductive pressure resistant
heating chamber broadly designated at 42 with a pressure resistant chamber closure
broadly indicated at 43. A common rack 44 holds a plurality of sample cups 45 and a
plurality of collection vials 46.
[0071] As used herein, the term "heat conductive" or "thermally conductive" are used in
their well-understood sense to represent materials through which heat passes relatively
quickly. Its opposite is, of course, the term "insulating," which is likewise well-understood
as describing materials through which heat passes more slowly. On that basis, many
metals and alloys are particularly useful for the vessel given that such conductivity is one
of the distinguishing characteristics of most metals and alloys. Alternatively, many
polymeric materials are considered insulating and ordinarily less helpful in the context of
the present disclosure.      The thermal conductivities of many metals and alloys are
published and widely disseminated, and an appropriate metal or alloy can be selected by
the skilled person without undue experimentation.
                                               9

[0072] A y-z axes robot arm 47 carries an x-axis robot arm 50. The robot arms 47, 50 are
controlled by a processor (CPU Figure 8) for the purpose of moving the sample cups (one
at a time in the illustrated embodiment) to and from the common rack 44 into the opened
pressure chamber 42. The robot arms 47, 50 also serve other functions with respect to the
movement of fluids and the collection vials (Figure 8).
[0073] Other aspects of the illustrated embodiment include the spill basin 51, the touch
screen 52 for input and output to the processor, a transparent cover (not illustrated for the
sake of clarity, a handle 53 on the rack 44, an on off switch 54 and communication ports
55. Figure 1 also illustrates portion of a syringe 40 for certain fluid movements (Figure
10) within the instrument. A flush fixture 56 is positioned within the chamber housing 32.
[0074] Figure 1 also illustrates portions of a chamber exhaust 57 and a vent intake 60 for
cooling some of the electronics within the chamber housing 32.
[0075] Figure 2 is a perspective view similar to Figure 1, but showing some slightly
different details such as the second fluid head slot 75 and the track 61 for the y-z robot arm
47.
[0076] Figure 3 is a rear perspective view of the instrument 30. An auxiliary valve 62
provides the means for adding liquid samples or other starting materials to a sample cup
45 in the pressure chamber 42. A vent valve 63 allows for the release of gas so that liquids
can displace gas in fluid lines and from the pressure chamber 42. The gas agitation valve
64 allows liquid to be released from the chamber, or gas to be bubbled into the pressure
chamber 42, or can be closed completely. The auxiliary, vent, and gas valves 62, 63, and
64 are typically ball valves, but it will be understood that other types of valves can be used
and that the selection of a small functional valve (and related fluid handling fixtures) for
the instrument can be made by the skilled person without undue experimentation.
[0077] The multiport valve 65 (e.g., a rotary valve) allows various liquids to be directed as
desired. The multiport valve is associated with a plurality of tubes and fittings for the
intended purpose,      and these likewise      can be   selected and used without undue
experimentation by the skilled person, either in the illustrated arrangement or in other
arrangements consistent with the remaining structure and purposes of the instrument 30.
For the sake of clarity, not every single possible connection for supplying solvents or
removing solvent extracts has been illustrated.
                                                10

[0078] Figure 3 offers a particularly good view of the heat sink 66 which surrounds the
pressure chamber 42. As described herein the instrument 30 heats solvents and sample
matrices in the heat resistant pressure chamber 42, but also offers a very convenient rapid
return of the solvent to ambient or near-ambient temperature. The heat sink enhances the
cooling function.
[0079] Figure 3 also shows a liquid outlet 67 at or near the bottom of the pressure chamber
42 along with associated tubing connecting it to the liquid exit valve 64.
[0080] An exhaust vent 70 for helping to cool additional electronics is in portions of the
main housing 33. A power supply plug 71 is in lower portions of the main housing 33 and
a laboratory bottle 68 is illustrated to show the instrument in context (e.g., for supplying
solvent or collecting waste).
[0081] Figure 4 is a side elevational view of the instrument 30. Most of the items in Figure
4 have been described with respect to Figures 1-3, but Figure 4 additionally illustrates the
dispersing faucet 72 and the robot claw 73 on the Y-Z robot arm 47. As described with
respect to Figure 8, the dispersal faucet 72 is connected (when the desired valves are
arranged for this purpose) to deliver solvent extract and analyte from the drain 110 (Figure
14) to the cooling coil (160 Figure NN) in the chiller 130 (Figure 10) and then to one of the
collection vials 46 after the chamber 42 has been opened to atmospheric pressure. The
term "faucet" is used herein in its dictionary sense of a device for controlling the flow of
liquid from a pipe with common synonyms including "tap" or "cock."
[0082] Figure 5 is a front elevational view of the instrument 30. Again, Figure 5 illustrates
items previously described, but adds or clarifies some details. In particular Figure 5
illustrates the parallel slide slots 74 and 75. The slots 74, 75 hold liquid dispensing fixtures
in a manner that lets the fixtures move vertically within the chamber housing 32, and are
better illustrated in Figure 6.
[0083] Figure 5 also illustrates that in the illustrated embodiment, the rack 44 holds the
sample cups 45 and the collection vials 46 in a riser-like arrangement with the sample cups
45 and the collection vials 46 closest to the chamber housing 30 being highest and those
near the spill basin 51 being the lowest.
[0084] Figure 6 is a rear elevational view similar to Figure 3 and with portions of the main
housing 33 cover having been removed for purposes of visibility. In particular, Figure 6
illustrates the slide slots 74, 75 somewhat more clearly along with their slide fittings 76
                                                11

and 77. The slide fittings 76, 77 in the slots 74, 75 provide a liquid delivery inlet fixture in
the thermally conductive pressure resistant heating chamber 42 for delivering liquids
(most commonly solvents or rinses) from a supply such as the supply bottle 68 illustrated
in both Figure 3 and Figure 6.
[0085] Figure 7 is a view identical to Figure 6 with the exception that Figure 7 illustrates
a rear cover 80 as part of the main housing 33 with the cover 80 carrying a plurality of
openings 81 for ventilation and heat transfer (cooling).
[0086] In carrying out preparation of a sample for molecular analysis, the sample matrix
is placed in the sample cup 45 which is then placed in the thermally conductive chamber
42, following which the closure 43 seals the chamber 42 for pressurization. A solvent from
a supply (e.g., 68) is delivered to the sample cup 45 (and thus to the sample matrix) through
the auxiliary valve 62, the associated tubing (unnumbered), and the delivery head (e.g.,
182, Figure 24). Similarly, a liquid matrix sample can be delivered to the auxiliary valve
62 and thereafter to the chamber 42.
[0087] Figure 8 is a cross-sectional view taken along lines 11-11 of Figure 2. Figure 8
illustrates that a lead screw 105 and its motor 106 (both shown generally) cooperate to
move the pressure resistant chamber closure 43 over the sample cup 45 in the pressure
chamber 42.
[0088] The sample cup 45 is positioned in the thermally conductive pressure resistant
heating chamber 42 to heat liquids and solids together in the sample cup 45.
[0089] Figure 8 further illustrates that the sample cup is placed in the pressure chamber
42. In the illustrated embodiment the pressure chamber (shown in more detail in Figure
14) includes a funnel shaped lower portion 110 into which liquids can drain towards a
lateral tube 111 and then a liquid exit port 112 (Figure 14). When the drained liquid is
the extraction solvent containing the analyte, the appropriate valves will direct the solvent
extract to the faucet 72 on the X axis robot arm 50 to deliver the extraction solvent and the
analyte to one of the collection vials 46.
[0090] If additional or secondary agitation of materials in the sample cup 45 is desired or
necessary, the ultrasonic generator 113 and its transmitting rod 114 can be incorporated.
The ultrasonic generator is typically a piezoelectric generator based upon its combination
of size, cost, and reliability, but this is exemplary rather than limiting of this aspect of the
disclosure.

[0091] Other details illustrated in Figure 8 include a cross-sectional view of a row of the
sample cups 45, a cooling fan 115, the position of the transparent housing 116, the power
supply 117, the control board 120, and the processor 121.
[0092] Figure 9 is a horizontal cross-sectional view taken along lines 12-12 of Figure 5, and
provides additional details about the instrument. A number of elements common to the
previous drawings are also illustrated in Figure 9.
[0093] Figure 9 illustrates that the thermally conductive pressure chamber 42 is in
thermal contact with a heater shown as the annular structure 122 separated from the
chamber 42 proper by the heat sink 66.
[0094] An air pump 123 can purge the pressure chamber as part of the overall exhaust
system, and a drive motor 124 for the valves and other mechanical items is illustrated
adjacent to the syringe 40. Additional electronics are indicated at 125, and a cooling fan
126 helps maintain a favorable temperature inside the main housing 33, with the vent for
the fan having been illustrated in Figure blank.
[0095] Figure 9 also shows the Y-Z robot arm track 61.
[0096] Figure 10 is a rear cross sectional view taken along lines 13-13 of Figure 6 and gives
a somewhat different view of a number of the elements already described. Figure 10
accordingly includes the actuator housing 31, the chamber housing 32, and the main
housing 33. The lead screw 105 and the lead screw motor 106 are illustrated with the
chamber top 43 in the open position above the chamber 42 and the sample cup 45.
[0097] In comparison to previous drawings, Figure 10 most helpfully illustrates the chiller
shown in the form of the coil housing13. The coil 160 is in liquid communication with the
sample cup 45 in the pressure resistant heating chamber 42 and receives heated liquids
from the pressure resistant heating chamber 42 when the chamber 42 is opened to
atmospheric pressure.    The coil in the coil housing 130 has a length sufficient to reduce
the temperature of common extraction solvents to useful handling temperatures with a
range of from between about 50'C and 180'C to between about 25'C and 40'C being
exemplary (but not limiting) as the solvent travels the length of the cooling coil.
[0098] Figure 10 also illustrates the syringe 40, the syringe piston 131, the syringe drive
132, and the syringe drive motor 133. Figure 10 includes cross-sectional views of a number
of elements previously described including the auxiliary valve 62, the vent valve 63, the
gas valve 64, the multiport valve 65, and the Y-Z axis robot track 61.

Figure 4 and illustrating center portions of the instrument 30 illustrating many of the
same elements as previously described, and Figure 12 represents an enlarged portion
providing somewhat greater detail. Figures 14 and 15 illustrate the chamber 42 and
chamber closure 43 in the opened position.
[0100] Figure 13 is analogous to Figure 11, but showing the lead screw 105 having moved
to place the chamber closure (chamber top) 43 on the remainder of the chamber 42 to
illustrate the position in which the extractions and related procedures are carried out.
[0101] Figure 14 is an enlarged view of center portions of Figure 13.
[0102] Figure 15 is a cross sectional view taken on a horizontal plane of the sample cup 45
positioned in the pressure resistant heating chamber 42, surrounded by the heat sink 66
which in turn is surrounded by the heater 133. Because the heat sink is favorably
thermally conductive, it efficiently transmits heat to and from the chamber 42 and thus to
and from the contents of the sample cup 45.
[0103] Use and Experimental
[0104] In an exemplary use of the instrument 30, an extraction solvent and a sample
matrix are placed into the sample cup 45, and the sample cup 45 is positioned in the
pressure resistant heating chamber 42. Typical (but not limiting) sample matrices include
food, food packaging, and soil.
[0105] As recognized by the skilled person (e.g., US EPA Method 3545) samples should be
extracted using a solvent system that gives optimum reproducible recovery of the analytes
of interest from the sample matrix, at the concentrations of interest.        The choice of
extraction solvent depends on the analytes of interest and no single solvent is universally
applicable to all analytes.
[0106] Typical (but not limiting) solid-liquid extraction solvents for molecular analysis
include water, weak acids, weak bases,          acetone, hexane 2-propanol, cyclohexane,
dichloromethane, acetonitrile, methanol, and mixtures thereof.
[0107] Common solvents used for liquid/liquid extraction are water, weak acids, weak
bases, ethyl acetate, methyl tertiary-butyl ether ("MTBE"), dichloromethane ("methylene
chloride"), hexane, and mixtures thereof.
The extraction solvent and the sample matrix are mixed in the sample cup 45 in the
chamber 42. An advantage of the instrument is the capacity to carry out extraction on
                                              14

loose-as opposed to tightly packed-      samples. Although the term "loose" is relative, it is
used here in its normal sense as being free from anything that binds or restrains and free
or released from fastening or attachment (Urdang, THE RANDOM HOUSE COLLEGE
DICTIONARY, Random House Inc. (1972)). Because the sample matrix is loose, the addition
of solvent from the top, the bottom, or both, helps disperse the sample matrix in the solvent.
[0108] The instrument can also be used to encourage the sample to disperse in the solvent
by applying a thermal gradient; using an agitating flow of a gas that is otherwise inert to
the sample matrix, the analyte or the solvent; or in some applications ultrasonic vibration.
Those skilled in the extraction art will recognize that an agitating gas can be selected based
on known parameters, and that in some cases compressed air will be appropriate while in
others nitrogen, one of the noble gases (e.g., helium, argon), or hydrogen may be best (with
care based upon hydrogen's flammable characteristics).
[0109] Other mixing techniques can be used (e.g., magnetic stirrers or other mechanical
devices), but will require more complex instrumentation.
[0110] The sample matrix and the solvent are then heated in the sample cup 45 in the
chamber 42 to a temperature at which evaporated solvent generates an above-atmospheric
pressure. A temperature of 50 0 C-1800 C is exemplary (the US Environmental Protection
Agency suggests 120'C for soil), at which temperature typical organic extraction solvents
generate a corresponding pressure of 50-250 pounds per square inch (psi) (about 345 kPa
to about 1724 kPa). In experiments to date, the time to reach this temperature is about 90
seconds, at which point extraction is substantially complete (it being understood that
extraction is an equilibrium process).      The pressure generated by the vapor from the
solvent is then used to drain the solvent extract from the sample cup into the cooling coil
(160, Figure 24) in chiller 130 that has a length sufficient to reduce the temperature of the
extract to near ambient (e.g., 250 C) while the solvent extract is in the coil. The solvent
extract is then collected from the coil 160, typically in a collection vessel 46. In exemplary
experiments, metal tubing with a length of about 10 feet tends provide a dwell time of
about 30 seconds, which is sufficient to cool the solvent extract to ambient or near-ambient
temperature. Thus, the coil is typically used for space saving purposes, but a coil shape is
optional rather than mandatory.
[0111] The sample matrix and the extraction solvent can be added in amounts that are
typical in this field.  For example, a solid matrix is collected in a manner that provides
                                               15

between about 5 or 10 grams (g) of the sample matrix of interest. The amount of extraction
solvent will be proportional; typically about 30-100 milliliters (mL).
[0112] The draining step takes place when the auxiliary valve 62 is opened to atmospheric
pressure so that the pressurized solvent vapor in the thermally conductive chamber 42
pushes the liquid solvent extract out through the port fitting 112 and then to the cooling
coil 160.
[0113] The instrument 30 is also useful for extraction based sample preparation that
includes the step of placing a solvent, adsorbent particles, and a sample matrix that
contains an analyte into the sample cup 45, with the improvement steps of heating the
vessel, the sample matrix, the adsorbent particles and the solvent in the pressure resistant
chamber 42 until the temperature generates an above atmospheric pressure that together
with the increased temperature drives the analyte substantially from the sample matrix
into the solvent.
[0114] In this aspect, the instrument 30 provides a faster and simpler alternative to both
SPE and dispersive SPE.       The absorbent particles can be those typically used for the
stationary phase in such methods.
[0115] In particular, the selection of adsorbent particles can be based on factors that are
well known in the art, and for the most part upon the polarity of the extraction solvent and
the polarity of the expected analyte. In general molecules of similar polarity attract one
another and this factor is used in a number of separation based fields of analysis and
sample preparation including liquid or gas chromatography, solid phase extraction,
dispersive solid phase extraction, and the present disclosure.
[0116] Generally, salts are considered the most highly polar followed closely by acids, and
then the smaller alcohols. Fluorinated organic compounds are the least polar, followed
closely by aliphatic and aromatic compounds.
[0117] Solvents within each of these categories are similarly well understood. Similarly,
the characteristics stationary phases such as silica are well understood. In particular,
unbonded silica tends to be hydrophilic (polar), but can be modified by adding various
functional groups to change the characteristics towards lower polarity; e.g., Arsenault
2012, supra, at page 138.
                                              16

[0118] Obviously, a wide ranging selection is available to the skilled person, and because
the instrument 30 uses the same solvents and stationary phases as other methods,
appropriate choices can be made without undue experimentation.
[0119] In another aspect, the instrument 30 can also prepare liquid matrices that include
the analyte of interest. In this aspect, the method includes the steps of adding a liquid
sample matrix to a plurality of particles that carry an extraction solvent. Such particles
are also referred to as solvent impregnated resins ("SIRs"). The solvent carrying particles
are positioned in the sample cup. The particles and the liquid matrix are agitated, heated,
and pressurized in the sample cup to extract the analyte from the heated liquid sample
matrix and into the solvent carried by the particles.
[0120] Thereafter the pressurized heated liquid matrix is drained by opening the chamber
42 to atmospheric pressure and this liquid leaves the sample cup through the foraminous
floor 147.
[0121] In the next step, a release solvent is added to the porous particles carrying the
extraction solvent and the analyte.    The agitating, heating and pressurizing steps are
repeated for the release solvent and the particles to release the analyte into the release
solvent. The release solvent is then drained by opening the thermally conductive chamber
42 to atmospheric pressure to allow the release solvent to travel in the cooling coil 160
until the drained release solvent reaches ambient or near-ambient temperature, after
which it is collected for analysis.
[0122] Appropriate particles are generally well understood in the art and are typically
formed of a physically durable water insoluble polymer resin in a mesh size (or range of
mesh sizes) that will be retained by the porous sleeve, and typically with a broad
distribution in pore sizes.       The polymer should, of course, remain stable at the
temperatures and pressures generated in the extraction steps.
[0123] Typical particles    are formed from resins     such as hydrophobic     cross-linked
polystyrene copolymer resins; polymers based on styrene cross-linked with divinyl
benzene, and polymerized methacrylic acid ester.         See, e.g., Kabay et al, Solvent
impregnatedresins (SIRs) - Methods of preparationand their applications; Reactive &
Functional Polymers 70 (2010) 484-496.
[0124] As in the previous embodiments, the step of draining the release solvent includes
draining the heated release solvent to the cooling coil 160 in the manner previously
                                             17

described. At that point, the release solvent containing the analyte is at a temperature
ready for molecular analysis in conventional equipment.
[0125] Basically, the instrument 30 can be used to prepare any analyte that is stable at
the expected temperatures and pressures.
[0126] Some examples of analytes for which the methods described herein are suitable
include aromatic and aliphatic compounds such as:          benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene,
xylene(s), cumene, limonene, nitrobenzene, cresol(s), higher alkylated phenols, octanol,
nonanol, decanol, hexane, heptane, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), tetrahydrotiophene,
cs2, tetramethyltetrahydrofuran, and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), among others.
[0127] The instrument 30 can also prepare samples containing halogenated/chlorinated
compounds      such     as   monochloromethane,        dichloromehane,     trichloromethane,
tetrachloromethane,    dichloroethane   (1,1   & 1,2), trichloroethane,   tetrachloroethane,
chloroethylene, dichloroethylene, trichloroethylene,tetrachloroethylene, trichloropropane,
chlorobutadiene,       hexachlrobutadiene,         monochlorobenzene,         dichlorobenzen,
chlorobenzenes,       chloroaphtalene,       hexachlorocyclohexane,       monochlorophenol,
dichlorophenol, trichlorophenol, dichloro-di-isopropylether, and dioxins.
[0128] The instrument 30 can also prepare samples containing polyaromatic hydrocarbons
such as PCBs, naphtalene, acenaphtylene,           acenaphthene,   flourene, phenanthrene,
anthracene, flouranthene, pyrene, benz(a) antharacene, chrysene, and dibenzothiophene.
[0129] Solvents can be selected from the group consisting of water, weak acids, weak bases,
ethyl acetate, methyl tertiary-butyl ether ("MTBE"), methylene chloride, hexane, acetone,
hexane 2-propanol, cyclohexane, acetonitrile, methanol and mixtures thereof, but are not
limited to that particular group7
[0130] The instrument 30 can also be used for techniques that add adsorbent particles to
the sample cup with the solid matrix and the extraction solvent. The use of an appropriate
extraction solvent and resin particles will transfer the analyte from the solid matrix to the
resin particles, following which the extraction solvent can be drained to waste, and a
release solvent added to the mixture of solid matrix and adsorbent particles to release the
analyte into the release solvent. The remaining steps are the same.

[0133] Table 1 plots data from the extraction of bases neutrals and acids ("BNA's") from
soil comparing Soxhlet (EPA 3540C), the current invention (Example 1), and accelerated
solvent extraction (ASE; EPA 3545). The volume and time for the indicated ASE's are
taken from a run using the parameters set forth in Dionex application note 317. Analysis
was carried out using gas chromatography followed by mass spectroscopy (GCMS; EPA
8270).
[0134] The instrument 30 uses significantly less solvent and takes significantly less time
than the other methods. In particular, the preparation of the ASE extraction cell is
generally tedious with over 10 components and steps, whereas the instrument 30 uses just
three straightforward pieces (the sleeve 86 and its supports 87 and 90). On average,
preparation of an ASE extraction cell takes about 15 minutes, while the invention is ready
in a few seconds.

(CRM) soil obtained from Waters Corporation (Milford, MA 01757 U.S.A.; ERA catalog

materials known to be present in the CRM sample. For each method, all of the recoveries
were within the quality control performance acceptance limits, but the invention (Example
1) recovered all 39 analytes, while ASE recovered only 38, and failed to identify 2
methylnaphthalene. The invention accordingly had the best overall performance in terms
of the analytes recovered and the percent recovery of the analytes.

    polyethylene in a CRM sample (SPEX CertiPrep CRM-PE001; Metuchen, NJ 08840, USA).
    In this experiment agitation was carried out with 30 seconds of both bubbling and
    sonication prior to heating. Again, the instrument 30 (Example 2) recovery data was
    significantly better than ASE and showed an improvement with the use of agitation.
    Example 2's results with agitation match Soxhlet data which is considered the "gold
    standard" for extraction. All analytes in the CRM were recovered for all methods.

[0146] In another aspect, the invention provides an improvement upon the dispersive SPE
("dSPE") method referred to in the art as QuEChERS.           QuEChERS is an accepted
extraction and matrix clean up procedure for multi-residue analytes in a variety of
different matrices.   The invention is an alternative option to QuEChERS that offers
comparable results easily, quickly and reliably

published recoveries for AOAC method 2001.01 (Journal of Chromatography A, 1271
(2010) 2548-2560).    The invention (Example 3) achieved comparable results to those
published. In comparison, QuEChERS data can vary widely due to the manual nature of
the procedure
[0156] Figure 19 is a full scan chromatogram of the results of the Example 3 soybean
extraction carried out using the method of the invention.
[0157] Figures 20-23 illustrate an embodiment that has particular advantages when the
vapor pressure of the heated solvent may not be sufficient to move the extraction solvent
from the thermally conductive reaction chamber efficiently or completely
[0158] Based upon certain differences from the previously illustrated embodiments, some
of the elements in Figures 20-23 may be named and numbered differently than similar (but
not necessarily identical) parts previously described. Figure 24 is a schematic diagram.
[0159] With that in mind, the embodiment illustrated in Figure 20 includes a sample cup
135 with one open filtered end 136 and a mouth 137 opposite the open filtered end 136. As
                                             23

used herein, the term opposite certainly includes positions that are diametrically opposed
along an axis, but also can mean positions that are situated with the greater part of the
sample cup being between the mouth 137 and the open filtered end 136. See, e.g., Urdang,
THE RANDOM HOUSE COLLEGE DICTIONARY, Random House Inc. (1972). The sample cup
135 is cylindrical, and formed of a material with a relatively high heat conductivity, and
that withstands vapor pressures generated by typical extraction solvents at temperatures
of at least about 125'C, with stainless steel being exemplary.         The selection of the
appropriate stainless steel (or other alloy or alternative thermally-conductive material) is
well within the knowledge of the person of ordinary skill in these arts, and can be selected
and incorporated without undue experimentation.
[0160] In particular, the cylinder walls of the sample cup 135 can be relatively thin for
enhancing heat conduction, provided the walls have sufficient strength for the overall
purposes of the instrument and the related methods.
[0161] A reaction chamber 140 surrounds the sample cup 135. The reaction chamber 140
and the sample cup 135 are positioned relative to one another to together define open jacket
portions 141 between the interior surfaces of the reaction chamber 140 and the exterior
surfaces of the sample cup 135. The reaction chamber 140 is likewise formed of a material
with a relatively high heat conductivity and physical strength, with those materials that
are suitable for the sample cup 135 being similarly suitable for the reaction chamber.
[0162] The reaction chamber 140 includes a drain floor 142 which corresponds to the drain
110 illustrated in (for example) Figure 14. A pressure sealing lid 143 is positioned over
the mouth 137 of the sample cup 135 and a first solvent inlet 145 opens from the pressure
sealing lid 143 to the interior of the sample cup 135. The drain floor 142 is illustrated as
frustoconical in shape, but other shapes (e.g., hemispherical, polygonal) are likewise
appropriate, provided the solvent drains as intended.
[0163] A second solvent inlet 144 provides fluid communication through and between the
drain floor 142 and the reaction chamber 140 and external waste containers or solvent
sources.
[0164] A reaction chamber heater 146 is positioned in thermal contact with the reaction
chamber 140. In this arrangement solvent (e.g., from the tank 165 in Figure 24) can be
added from two directions. First, solvent can be added to the sample cup from the first
solvent inlet 145 into the sample cup 135. Additionally solvent can be added from the
                                              24

second inlet 144 into both the jacket portions 141 and (through the open filtered end 136
and the foraminous floor 147) into the sample cup 135 so that the reaction chamber heater
146 can heat the reaction chamber 140 and solvent in the jacket portions 141, which in the
embodiment illustrated in Figure 20 form a cylinder between the cylindrical reaction
chamber 140 and the cylindrical sample cup 135.
[0165] In turn the heated solvent in the jacket portions 141 can heat the sample cup 135
and heat solvents and extraction samples inside the sample cup 135.
[0166] Figure 20 also illustrates that in this embodiment the open filtered end 136 of the
sample cup 135 is a threaded foraminous floor 147 analogous to the foraminous floor 96
(Figure 8). The lower end of the sample cup 135 likewise carries threads 150 so that the
foraminous floor can be removed from the sample cup 135, typically to remove a filter
medium (148, Figure 24) from lower portions of the sample cup 135. Typically the filter
medium rests on the foraminous floor 147, and can be formed of a disk or equivalent shape
of filter paper, quartz fiber filters, membrane filters, filtration microplates, or any other
filter medium (or media, or combinations) that are otherwise consistent with the chemistry
of the samples, the solvents, and the expected or desired flow rate of solvents from the
sample cup 135 following a heated extraction.
[0167] Figure 20 also illustrates that the sample cup 135 can be sealed to the pressure
sealing lid 143 with the aid of an O-ring 151 and that the entire reaction chamber 140 can
be pressure sealed with the aid of a larger O-ring 152.
[0168] The first solvent inlet 145 communicates with any convenient solvent source (165,
Figure 24) through the threaded inlet fitting 153 and its tube 154 both of which are part
of the pressure sealing lid 143. Another portion of the pressure sealing lid 143 includes a
female threaded opening 155 and its associated tube 156, the combination of which serves
at least two useful purposes when using the instrument 30 and carrying out heated
extractions. First, the opening 155 can be used to vent the reaction vessel 135 as desired
or necessary. More specifically to associated extraction methods, the opening 155 can be
attached to a valve (138, Figure 24)) which in turn can control the flow of gases into and
out of the sample cup 135 as well as to any associated pressure gauge (139, Figure 24).
[0169] As additional details, Figure 20 illustrates a tool seat 157 in the lid 143 for assisting
in opening the entire reaction chamber 140. A thermocouple (shown schematically at 160)
is positioned in or near the drain floor 142 in order to provide a highly accurate
                                              25

temperature measurement of the sample cup 135 and any extraction sample and solvent
in the sample cup 135.
[0170] The benefits of the thermocouple 160 and the pressure gauge 139 are more evident
in the context of the method described later herein.
[0171] As in the earlier-presented embodiments, the instrument 30 includes a chiller 130
in liquid communication with the drain floor 142 in the sample cup 135 for receiving heated
liquids from the sample cup at 135 and the reaction chamber 140 when the drain floor 142
is opened (again using a valve) to atmospheric pressure. As in the previously illustrated
embodiments, the chiller 130 is a cooling coil in liquid communication with the drain floor
142, and the cooling coil 130 has a length sufficient to reduce the temperature of common
extraction solvents from between about 120'C and 130'C to between about 25'C and 35'C
as the solvent travels the length of the cooling coil 130.
[0172] Figures 21, 22, and 23 illustrate the same elements as Figure 20, but in either in
larger or separated detail. In Figure 21 such details include the threads 161 for the first
solvent inlet 145, with the remaining elements otherwise being the same as in Figure 20
and numbered accordingly.
[0173] Figure 22 is an isolated perspective view of the sample cup 135 with the threaded
foraminous floor 147 shown in place on the male threaded end 150 of the sample cup 135.
Figure 22 illustrates that the sample cup 135 has a mouth lip 162 and a beveled edge 163
on the threaded foraminous floor 147 that helps seat the threaded foraminous floor 147 in
the drain floor 142.
[0174] In order to allow solvent to flow from the drain floor 142 into the jacket portions
141, the threaded foraminous floor 147 also carries a plurality (four are shown) of seal
breaks illustrated as the notches 164.
[0175] The embodiment illustrated in Figures 20-23 provides the capability to carry
another helpful method embodiment.         In this context, the invention is an extraction
method comprising the steps of placing an extraction sample in the heat conductive sample
cup 135 surrounded by the reaction chamber 140 with the heat conductive sample cup 135
having its open filtered end 136, and then adding extraction solvent to both the inside of
the sample cup 135 and to the reaction chamber 140 outside of the sample cup 135.
[0176] Heating the solvent in the reaction chamber 140 outside of the sample cup 135 in
turn heats the sample cup 135, heats the solvent inside the sample cup 135, and heats the
                                              26

extraction sample inside the sample cup 135.        In particular, the method heats solvent
outside of the sample cup 135 by heating the reaction chamber 140.
[0177] In the method, the extraction solvent is added to the sample cup 135 through the
open filtered end 136 to thereby help agitate the extraction sample with the extraction
solvent.
[0178] Using the illustrated embodiment of the instrument 30, the extraction method
further comprises sealing the sample cup 135 between the pressure sealing lid 143 at the
sample cup mouth 137 and the outlet valve 138 in fluid communication with the open
filtered end 136 of the sample cup 135 so that the heating step increases the vapor pressure
of the extraction solvent above the solvent's vapor pressure at standard temperature and
pressure (25'C; 1 atmosphere).
[0179] Opening the outlet valve 138 allows the vapor pressure in the sample cup 135 to
drive the extraction solvent out of the sample cup 135 through the open filtered end 136,
to the drain floor 142 and through the outlet valve 138.
[0180] As set forth with respect to the description of the physical parts, the method
typically includes the step of driving the solvent into the chiller 130 for a time sufficient to
reduce the temperature of common extraction solvents from between about 120 C and
130'C to between about 25'C and 35'C in the chiller (coil) 130.
[0181] Finally, the extraction solvent can be collected from the coil 130 for molecular
analysis.
[0182] The embodiment illustrated in Figures 20-23 accordingly describes an instrument
that incorporates the extraction solvent itself for additional thermal conduction as well as
extraction. The capacity to pressure-seal the sample cup in the chamber helps increase
the vapor pressure for those solvent-sample combinations where this is helpful or
necessary.
[0183] The combination of the thermocouple 160 and the pressure gauge 139 can be used
to accurately determine the temperature in the sample cup 135 in relation to the vapor
pressure of the selected extraction solvent. In particular, the embodiment illustrated in
Figures 20-23 can be used to run a solvent or solvent system alone in the instrument to
develop a correlation between solvent temperature and vapor pressure. As schematically
illustrated in Figure 24, a processor 149 can be used for this purpose. Thereafter, vapor
                                              27

pressure can be measured to indicate solvent temperature in the sample cup 135 with a
high degree of accuracy.
[0184] As a further advantage, Because this embodiment seals the sample cup 135 in the
reaction chamber 140, the system can also be pre-pressurized (for example up to about 25
pounds per square inch) in the headspace (i.e., the gas above the solvent and sample) with
air or an inert gas (i.e., a gas inert to the sample and to the extraction solvent; 166 in
Figure 24) to help force the hot liquid solvent to a higher temperature before the solvent
generates the desired vapor pressure. Keeping the solvent in the liquid state also helps
with the desired the thermal transfer inside and outside of the reaction vessel.
[0185]   A gas valve 167 can vent the system (e.g., to vent 170 in Figure 24), or direct gas
for pressure measurement at the gauge 139, or direct inert gas from the source 166 into
the reaction vessel 135.
[0186] Perhaps just as importantly, a higher pressure in the headspace helps ensure that
all of the extraction solvent is pushed from the sample cup 135, through any filter media
and the foraminous floor 147, and thereafter to the drain floor 142 and the cooling coil 130.
[0187] Further to Figure 24 and to complete the description of the possibilities, solvent can
flow from the solvent supply 165 to the rotary valve 65 through the line 171. The line 172
connects the rotary valve 65 with the auxiliary valve 62. The line 173 connects the
auxiliary valve 62 to the gas valve 64 which in turn can use the line 174 to deliver solvent
to the bottom of the reaction chamber 140.
[0188] The line 169 connects the rotary valve 65 to the syringe 40 so that liquids from the
supply 165 can be metered into the syringe 40 from the supply 165 and thereafter from the
syringe 40 into the sample cup and through the lines 172 and 181 and the dispenser head
182. The dotted line 187 represents the position of solvent between the sample cup 135
and the reaction chamber 140 when the solvent is used to jacket the sample cup 135.
[0189] The gas supply 166 can supply extra pressure to the headspace through the lines
174 and 175 which, along with the gas flow to several other items, is controlled by the valve
138. The line 176 joins the valve 138 to the vent 170.
[0190] As part of the gas pressure monitoring, the line 177 connects the valve 138 to the
pressure gauge 139 and the pressure gauge 139 is wired to the processor 121 through the
communication line 180. The processor 121 is also connected to the thermocouple 160 using
the communication line 183 so that monitored combinations of temperature and vapor
                                             28

pressure for various sample extractions can be used to develop helpful standardized
information.
[0191] In order to provide agitating gas into the bottom of the reaction chamber 140 and
the sample cup 135, the gas supply at 166 is also connected to the valve 64 through an
appropriate line or tube 184.
[0192] A pressure head seal 185 seals the sample cup in the reaction chamber. Line 186
drains solvent from the valve 64 to the coil 130, and line 187 drains from the coil 130 to
the collection vessel 46.
[0193] In the drawings and specification there has been set forth a preferred embodiment

invention being defined in the claims.
