                               FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]     This invention relates to white- or silver-colored copper-based alloys with
reduced nickel content compared to standard alloys of similar color.
                         BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]     Copper base alloys are widely used for their combination of ease of
fabrication, corrosion resistance, electrical and thermal conductivity, and availability in a
wide range of attractive colors. They are the preferred material worldwide for circulating
coinage, in many cases as part of multi-layer composite systems. In addition, recent
research has shown copper and copper alloy surfaces can be manufactured to be
antimicrobial, inactivating a variety of microorganisms in a matter of two hours or less.
[0004]     Even though copper by itself is red in color, addition of most alloying elements
results in more or less reddish or yellowish colors. These colors are typically well known,
with descriptive names (brassy, golden, bronze, etc.). Alloys with a whiter color
(reflecting all light wavelengths more uniformly) are also available, although it is
generally difficult to achieve good white colors without strong reddish or yellowish
overtones, particularly after the material has tarnished or partially oxidized. These whiter
alloys are generally achieved using large additions of nickel (cupronickels and nickel
silvers). Unfortunately, nickel is more expensive than most other alloying elements, and
has been implicated as a major contributor to increased cases of allergic contact
                                               2

     WO 2010/030597                                                      PCT/US2009/056201
dermatitis when used in contact with human skin and other tissue. The intent of this
invention is to provide copper alloys with a good white color but using reduced nickel
content.
[0005]      Alloys consisting primarily of copper and nickel (with minor additions of other
elements) are known as cupronickels or copper-nickels. As the nickel content increases,
the color goes from copper red toward a pale reddish/purple at 10% Ni (C706) to a
reasonably pure white at 25% Ni (C713). This white copper-nickel is used extensively for
US circulating coinage as the material for the 5-cent coin and as the outside of the three
layer composite for the 10-cent, 25-cent and 50-cent coins. While attractive and durable,
the alloy is expensive due to the high Ni content, since Ni is typically over twice the price
of copper. The high cost of C713 is partially responsible for the use of composite coinage
in the US; by substituting a core of less expensive copper surrounded by the silver
colored C713, the desired appearance can be achieved at lower cost. Another alternative
to the high cost of white copper-nickels is to substitute zinc in the alloy for a portion of
the copper, forming the alloys known as "nickel silvers" for their silvery color. Although
less effective as a whitener for copper alloys than nickel, Zn reduces the need for Ni and
is both less dense and less expensive than either Cu or Ni. Copper alloys of high
manganese content (20% and more) are also reliably white but suffer from difficulties
with hot working and very low electrical and thermal conductivity, so they have been
used primarily as castings, where their lower melting point and increased fluidity
compared to "nickel silvers" is an advantage.

     WO 2010/030597                                                    PCT/US2009/056201
[0006]      By substituting a combination of Zn and Mn for most of the nickel in a white
colored copper alloy, a lower-cost alloy is possible with a similar appearance and other
novel properties. While other white-colored copper base alloys superficially similar to the
proposed alloys have been disclosed in the past, none match the composition range of this
invention, as will be brought out below.
[0007]      Numerous copper-nickels and nickel silvers are offered by various copper alloy
producers with more or less white colors. Of 41 wrought copper-nickel alloys listed in the
Copper Development Association (CDA) database, only two (C71640 and C72420) have
a Mn content greater than 1%; neither of these alloys contains Zn greater than 1%. Of 25
wrought nickel silvers (Cu-Zn-Ni alloys) listed, only four have a minimum Mn content;
all of these have Pb added to improve machining properties. Copper-aluminum alloys
(aluminum bronzes) will contain either Zn or Mn, but not both. There are only two
wrought Cu-Zn-Mn alloys listed in the CDA database, both nickel-free - C66900 and
C66950. The first contains 0.25% max Fe (as an impurity) and 0.20% max other
impurities with no other additions. The second (Wieland Alloy FX9) contains 14-15%
Zn, 14-15% Mn, 1.0-1.5% Al, and the balance Cu.
[0008]      Cast alloys listed in the CDA database show a similar trend; alloys which
contain more than 1% of both Mn and Zn also contain at least 0.5% of Al. The one
exception to this is an alloy known as "Bronwite" (C99750), which contains 17-23% Mn,
17-23% Zn, and at least 0.5% Pb with up to 5% Ni. Bronwite is very white, very fluid
and has a relatively low melting temperature which makes it excellent for small, thin and

delicate castings such as costume jewelry, but it contains enough Pb to cause problems
with current Restrictions on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Consumer Product Safety
regulations.
[0009]     A number of nickel-free white alloys have been disclosed in the past. Wieland
Alloy FX9 (C66950) has been mentioned above. YKK Corporation of Tokyo, Japan
holds a number of patents on nickel-free alloys. US Patent 5997663 covers two ranges: 1)
70-85% Cu, 5-22% Zn, 7-15% Mn and 0-4% of Al or Sn or a combination of both Al and
Sn (with a white color); and 2) 70-85% Cu, 10-25% Zn, 0-7% Mn, and 0-3% of Al or Sn
or a combination of both Al and Sn (with a distinctly yellow color). A second YKK
patent (US 6340446) discloses nickel-free alloys containing 0.5-5% Zn, 7-17% Mn, 0.5
4% Al and the balance copper, which may also contain one or more of Cr, Si, and/or Ti
up to 0.3%. A third such patent (EP1306453) teaches of Ni-free white alloys with 0.5
30% Zn and 1-7% Ti, optionally including up to 4% of a combination of one or more of
Al, Sn, Mg, and/or Mn.
[0010]     Another European patent (EP0685564) discloses a Ni-free alloy with generally
lower copper (50-70% Cu) and higher Mn (8-25% Mn) than the YKK patents with the
remainder zinc. Most of these previously disclosed Ni-free white alloys are intended to
meet the EU regulations restricting Ni in jewelry, eyeglasses, and similar items in "direct
and prolonged contact with human skin" (due to issues with allergies and sensitization)
by completely eliminating Ni and are generally intended for use as cast articles or as wire
products.

[0011]      An alloy disclosed in US Patent 6432556 (Brauer, et. al) contains 5-10% Mn,
10-14% Zn, 3.5-4.5% Ni and less than 0.07% Al with the balance Cu. The alloy content
of Patent 6432556 is specifically balanced so as to provide both a "golden visual
appearance" and an electrical conductivity suitable for use as a replacement for standard
alloy C713 (75 Cu-25 Ni) in both monolithic and clad form for use in circulating US
coinage, particularly as a yellow alloy replacement for the Susan B. Anthony (SBA)
dollar coin, and is currently in use as the outer clad layers of both the Sacajawea dollar
and the US Presidential dollar series of circulating coins. A related earlier patent (US
Patent 2445868, to Berwick and assigned to Olin Inc.) which is referred to in the
application for Patent 6432556 teaches about quaternary (4-component) alloys of Cu-Zn
Ni-Mn type with 5% Ni minimum and essentially no other additions.
[0012]      Another substantially Ni-free alloy is disclosed in US Patent 3778237
(Shapiro, et. al.) specifically as a substrate for silver plated articles such as flatware or
hollow ware for food service. This alloy consists of 8-16% Mn, 20-31% Zn and the
balance Cu with small additions of other elements (Al, Fe, Sn, Si, Co, Mg, Mo, Ni, P, As,
Sb) permitted but not required. Nickel is permitted up to 0.3% but preferably no Ni is
addedUS Patent 3778236 (Goldman, et. al.) is a patent for an alloy containing 0.5-5% Ni,
also restricted as a substrate for silver-plated articles. Other Ni-free Cu-Mn-Zn alloys are
disclosed in US Patent 2772962 (Reichenecker, for a cast electrical-resistance alloy) and
in US Patent 2479596 (Anderson and Jillson, et. al.).

          either in a monolithic form or as part of a composite system with other
          materials where the color, tarnish resistance and antimicrobial and other
          properties of the alloy of the invention permit creation of novel material

MI) or Hunter Associates Laboratory, Inc. (Reston, VA) quantify color according to two
chromatic attributes "hue" and "chroma" and a lightness attribute known as "value". Hue
is color perception, the recognition of an object as red, green, yellow, blue, etc. Chroma
is the color concentration (intensity or saturation), ranging from gray to the pure hue.
Value is a measure of the lightness of the color tone, ranging from pure white to pure
black. A combination of these values gives a unique location in color space in polar
coordinates, with hue denoting color tone (angular location), chroma denoting intensity
(radial location), and value denoting lightness (vertical location) in Figure 1.
[0034]     An alternative method of specifying color is by the CIELAB scale. CIE stands
for Commission Internationale de 1' Eclairage (International Commission on
Illumination) and LAB stands for the L*, a*, b* coordinates of the scale; thus CIELAB is
an abbreviation for CIE 1976 L* a* b* color scale. On this scale, hue is expressed in
terms of color pairs, with +a* being red, -a* being green, +b* being yellow, and -b*

being blue. Chroma (intensity or saturation) is expressed as a value from the center of the
coordinate system (0 being gray) to full intensity of the color component at ±60. Higher
values of any component mean more intense colors, while lower values mean the material
being measured is closer to colorless. The lightness value L* ranges from 0 (pure black)
to 100 (pure white). Once again, a specific combination of L*, a*, and b* values
identifies a unique location in color space and a specific color, saturation, and brightness.
[0035]     Colors of all alloys were analyzed using an SP-62 spectrophotometer
manufactured by X-Rite Inc. (Grand Rapids, MI). Analysis conditions were a d/8 sphere
geometry (specular reflection included) with a D65 illuminant and 100 observer. All color
measurements are reported on the CIE 1976 L* a* b* (CIELAB) scale. For initial color
measurement, samples were prepared with the same surface finish (6-18 Ra; a measure of
surface roughness) and cleaned to remove surface oxides, which can affect both initial
color measurement and subsequent analysis of atmospheric tarnishing resistance.
Chemistry and color of alloys according to the invention are presented in Table 1 along
with the same data for comparative copper alloys and selected stainless steels. Alloys
according to the present invention are listed in the tables as Il, 12, 13, etc. Comparative
copper alloys are listed as C1, C2, C3, etc. Comparative alloys which are not based on
copper (carbon and stainless steel, zinc and aluminum alloys, pure metals other than
copper, etc.) are listed as Si, S2, S3, and so forth.

[0037]       One of the difficulties with creating a "white" copper-base alloy is determining
exactly what is meant by "white". Many of the early applications for these alloys were as
lower-cost alloys for coinage, flatware, and hollowware, so the desired color was similar
to that of sterling and coin silver. More recently, "white" copper alloys are being
considered as replacements for stainless steel or brushed nickel finishes in builder's
hardware and architectural applications, so that the antimicrobial properties of copper
alloys are available with similar appearance to the modern look of stainless steel. A
number of traditional "white" copper alloys were analyzed for color, along with other
alloys which exhibited slight but distinct reddish or yellowish color overtones. Stainless

and carbon steel were also analyzed, along with pure nickel, zinc and tin such as would
be found on the surface of white-colored plated products. These materials were compared
to determine practical limits on CIELAB values for white alloys. Materials with
measured values of both a* and b* close to zero appear nearly colorless and thus whiter
than those with higher values of either a* or b* at the same overall lightness (L*) value.
Lightness values (L*) for copper alloys typically range from 75 - 86 for surfaces free of oxide
and a surface roughness of 6-18 Ra; this is true for all copper alloys measured, from bright
yellow cartridge brass (Alloy C2, Cu-30Zn) to red pure copper (Alloy C1) to the strongly white
copper-nickel used in circulating US coinage (Alloy C5).
[0038]     For purposes of determining the desired white color, the upper limit of a* is
hereafter defined at the point where the visual appearance of the copper alloy is no longer
primarily white and first becomes white with a distinctly red hue. This transition from
white to red is defined by the a* value of Alloy C31 (Cu-15Ni). Alloy C31 has an a*
value of 2.9. A comparable commercially available copper alloy (Alloy C4, Cu-ONi
1Fe) is noticeably reddish and has an a* value of 3.7. For the purposes of the present
invention, it is proper to consider alloys with a* values less than 3 and appropriate b*
values (on the CIELAB scale) to be white.
[0039]     For copper alloys with a white visual appearance, the upper limit of b* is
defined at the point where the copper alloy is no longer primarily white and first becomes
distinctly yellow (or white with a yellow hue). This transition from white to yellow is
defined by the b* value of comparative Alloy C3 (Cu-l2Zn-7Mn-4Ni). This is a patented
alloy with a "golden visual appearance" (as discussed in US 6,432,556 B1 to Brauer et
                                                 17

      WO 2010/030597                                                      PCT/US2009/056201
al.) and is specifically formulated to exhibit a color closer to that of 18K gold than to the
white of Alloy C5 used for circulating US coinage; this alloy has a measured b* value of
10.2. We set the upper limit for b* at 10, so that only alloys less yellow than Alloy C3 are
acceptable.
[0040]      Lower limits for a* and b* were set based on the color of pure zinc (Alloy
C35, a* -1.7, b* -1.9). Pure zinc subjectively appears white, although faint bluish and
greenish overtones are visible on freshly cleaned and prepared surfaces. Therefore the
lower limits for a* and b* were both set at -2 in order to include zinc in the white alloy
zone. Copper alloys measured in our studies all had CIELAB values a* > -1.5 and b* >
1.5.
To be considered white the copper alloy must meet the constraints listed above for both
a* and b*; that is, a* is preferably between about -2 and about +3, while b* is preferably
between about -2 and about +10. More preferably, a* is between about -2 and about +2,
while at the same time b* is between about -2 and about +8. Most preferably, a* is
between about -2 and about +1 while at the same time b* is between about -2 and about
+7. Alloys meeting one or the other but not both are not considered white. For example,
Alloy C2 (Cu-30Zn) has CIELAB a*, b* values of (-1.5, 21.5); although this falls within
the a* range for white (low redness), it exceeds the maximum allowable b* to be
considered white, therefore, Alloy C2 is a yellow copper alloy. A further example is
Alloy C4 (Cu-1ONi-1Fe), with CIELAB a*, b* values of (3.7, 8.2); although the b* value
is within the white range (low yellowness) it exceeds the allowable a* value, and is

visually reddish. Moreover, ranges having endpoints within the ranges discussed above
are contemplated even if those endpoints or ranges are not specially set forth. For
example, the range of values for a* may have a lower endpoint of -1.9, -1.8, -1.7, etc.
through +2.7, +2.8 and +2.9, while the upper endpoint may be +2.9, +2.8, +2.7, etc.
through -1.7, -1.8 and -1.9. Similar endpoints for the values b* are also contemplated.
Also, it also contemplated to combine any of the ranges for a* with any of the ranges for
b*. For example, the range of values for a* may be -2 to +2, while the range for the
values of b* may be -2 and about +10.

preferred embodiment, the alloys of the above compositions are also white copper-based
alloys; that is, they have CIELAB values where a* is preferably between about -2 and
about +3, while b* is preferably between about -2 and about +10. More preferably, a* is

preferably contains from 12% to 16% Zn, from 4% to 6% Mn, from 5% to 9% Ni, and
from 0.05% to 0.15% Zr. In a more preferred embodiment, each of the compositions
discussed above also has an electrical conductivity between 4% IACS and 7% IACS. In a
most preferred embodiment, the alloys of the above compositions are also white copper
based alloys; that is, they have CIELAB values where a* is preferably between about -2
and about +3, while b* is preferably between about -2 and about +10. More preferably,
a* is between about -2 and about +2, while at the same time b* is between about -2 and

may be combined with each range of CIELAB values discussed above as well as
combined with each of the electrical conductivity characteristics discussed above.

               1) 6-25% zinc, 4-17% manganese, 0.1-3.5% nickel and balance Cu ; and

               3) Same as 1) or 2), with 0.1-2.5% iron.
               4) Same as 1) or 2), with 0.1-5% nickel and 0.05-2.5% iron.
               5) 12-20% Zn, 10-17% Mn, and 0.5-3.5% Ni and balance Cu.
               6) 13-16% Zn, 14-17% Mn, and 1.5-2.5% Ni and balance Cu.

               10) 13-16% Zn, 14-17% Mn, 1.5-2.5% Ni and 0.2-0.6% Fe and balance Cu.
               11) 6-25% zinc , 4-17% manganese, 0.1-9.0% nickel and balance Cu.

               values and any ranges of electrical conductivity.
[0046]     For all the components in the compositions, ranges having endpoints within the
ranges discussed above are also contemplated even if those endpoints or ranges are not
specially set forth. For example, the range of values for Zn may have a lower endpoint of
6.1% 6.2%, 6.3%, etc. through 24.7%, 24.8% and 24.9%, while the upper endpoint may
be 24.9%, 24.8%, 24.7%, etc. through 6.3%, 6.2% and 6.1%. Similar endpoints for the

ranges of the other components are also contemplated. Also, it also contemplated to
combine any of the specially set forth ranges for Zn with any of the specifically set forth
ranges for the other components. For example, ranges of from 6% to 25% zinc may be
combined with ranges of from 10% to 17% Mn, and from 0.5% to 3.5% Ni.
[0047]      A feature of the invention is that the alloys contain both Zn and Mn and lower
levels of Ni than traditional "white" copper-based alloys. This results from synergistic
effects of the alloying elements, where a combination of multiple components gives
results not obtainable with simple binary alloys.
[0048]      Nickel is a potent whitener in copper alloys. Addition of 10% Ni to Cu (Alloy
C4) gives a pale alloy but still with a reddish-purple tinge. Additions of 15% Ni (Alloy
C3 1) or more give distinctly white colors, and the alloys become more nearly colorless as
the Ni content increases to 30% (Alloy C6). Increased Ni contributes to atmospheric
tarnish resistance, inhibiting the formation of dark copper oxides. Unfortunately, Ni is
also significantly more expensive than Cu (generally 2-3 times the cost), so there is a
strong economic advantage to producing alloys similar in appearance but with less Ni.
Higher additions of Ni also decrease the antimicrobial effectiveness of the alloys, so Ni
should be held to a minimum consistent with the desired color and tarnish resistance.
Nickel has been implicated as the major factor in metal-contact dermatitis, prompting the
European Union to legislate Ni-free alloys for jewelry, eyeglasses, and similar items in
"direct and prolonged contact with human skin" as seen in EP 0 635 564 B 1

     WO 2010/030597                                                     PCT/US2009/056201
(Ammannati); "Copper-zinc-manganese alloy for the production of articles coming into
direct and prolonged contact with the human skin"; Dec. 1, 2000; title, pg. 1-2.
[0049]     Manganese is also an effective whitener in copper alloys, although binary
alloys have had little commercial significance due to low strength, difficulties with ingot
casting and hot rolling, and low and inconsistent ductility related to short-range ordering.
Addition of 12% Mn or more to Cu give a relatively white alloy (Alloy C30, [a*, b*] =
[5.05, 8.27]), but this is the range where short-range ordering becomes significant in
binary alloys. Manganese is commonly used for strengthening at low levels in more
complicated copper alloys containing Al, Zn, Si, Ni or combinations of these. These low
level Mn additions can also improve casting and hot rolling characteristics of these
alloys.
[0050]     Additions of Zn to copper alloys change the color strongly, but the alloys do
not become "white" or colorless; instead, Cu-Zn alloys ("brasses") become golden to
yellow as the content increases to -30% Zn. Beyond 33% Zn, the alloys turn reddish
again with the formation of a new crystal structure. High Zn-brasses also exhibit short
range ordering under certain conditions, which can limit ductility and cause properties to
change in service. Zinc can reduce the need for Ni in whitening copper-base alloys (the
basis of the "nickel silver" Cu-Ni-Zn alloys). Appearance is close to the white Cu-Ni
alloys, with a slight admixture of yellow due to the Zn content.
[0051]     Iron additions to copper alloys are limited by low solubility. There is a
miscibility gap above 3.5% Fe, preventing casting of higher-Fe alloys. Between 0.5% and
                                              25

     WO 2010/030597                                                     PCT/US2009/056201
2.5%, Fe can be retained in solid solution by suitable heat treatment, and it is nearly as
effective a whitener as Ni at the same levels. Fe can also be a potent strengthener,
forming precipitates both directly and by reaction with P (phosphorus) in the alloy.
[0052]     Zinc and aluminum are similar in copper alloys as far as color is concerned,
but Al is significantly more effective at achieving golden-yellow colors. Addition of 6%
Al (Alloy C32) gives a similar color to Cu-15Zn (Alloy C29). Over time, Cu-Al alloys
(including those with other elements such as Zn, Mn and Fe) form tight passive oxide
films which are beneficial for tarnish and corrosion resistance. This same effect reduces
antimicrobial effectiveness of alloys of Cu with Al, so Al should be held to a minimum
for antimicrobial applications. Hot- and cold-rolling and heat treatment of Al-containing
alloys is more complicated than those without Al, due to interactions with many other
alloying elements.
[0053]     One of the primary objects of the invention is to provide a copper alloy of
white visual appearance but with a reduced Ni content. The above description of the
effects of alloying additions on the color of copper-base alloys point to methods for
achieving this goal. By substituting Zn for a portion of the Ni, alloys of reduced Ni
content can be created although the color tends to become yellower than Cu-Ni alloys of
the same total Cu content. By further substituting Mn for some of the remaining Ni,
alloys with much lower Ni content are possible with substantially white (colorless)
appearance. We have found that retention of a low level of Ni (at a particular total alloy
content) helps maintain the desired white color and also has benefits in terms of
                                              26

     WO 2010/030597                                                       PCT/US2009/056201
atmospheric tarnish resistance and in decreasing staining due to contact with fluids from
human skin. Thus, copper alloys of white visual appearance are found by substituting a
combination of Zn and Mn for Ni in traditional alloys, along with maintaining a low level
of Ni for improved color and tarnish resistance.
[0054]      Another feature of the invention is that Fe may be used in place of Ni or in
addition to Ni to improve the whiteness of Cu-Zn-Mn alloys. When measuring the color
of commercial Cu-Ni alloys, we found that the whiteness of some of these alloys was
better than expected from the Ni content alone. The alloys in question were found to
contain significant amounts of Fe, added to improve casting and hot- and cold-working
properties in these alloys. Further investigation of Cu-Fe alloys showed that while they
are still distinctly red due to the low overall alloy content, they are closer to white (with a
lower a* value on the CIELAB scale) than expected for Cu-Zn or Cu-Mn of the same
alloy content. Based on this, we added up to 2.5% Fe to alloys of the invention and found
that the improved whiteness carried through even at total alloy content over 30%.
Further, we found that the presence of Ni did not interfere with the effect of Fe so either
or both may be used to improve the whiteness of Cu-Zn-Mn alloys. We also found that
the presence of Fe in solid solution in the alloy (at a particular total alloy content) helps
maintain the desired white color and also has benefits in terms of atmospheric tarnish
resistance and in decreasing staining due to contact with fluids from human skin,
similarly to the effects of low levels of Ni on these properties. These effects are also
found when Fe or a combination of Fe and Ni are used in place of Ni alone. Thus, copper
                                                27

alloys of white visual appearance are found by substituting a combination of Zn and Mn
for Ni in traditional alloys, along with maintaining a low level of Ni or Fe or a
combination of both Ni and Fe for improved color and tarnish resistance.
[0055]      An important factor in selection of copper-base alloys for appearance (such as
architectural and builder's hardware) is the stability of the appearance over time.
Stainless steels do not change appearance significantly when exposed to the atmosphere;
this is due to formation of passive oxide layers preventing visible tarnish and corrosion
and is why they are considered "stainless". Unfortunately, stainless steels are not
available in the wide range of colors and tones that can be achieved with copper-base
alloys, nor do stainless steels possess the antimicrobial characteristics of properly
prepared copper alloys. Traditionally, Ni is added to copper alloys for improved
resistance to atmospheric tarnishing, as Ni forms a passive oxide layer at the surface
similar in function to the passive surface of stainless steels. We have found that it is
possible to tailor the chemical composition of white copper alloys with reduced Ni
content to give alloys with a desirable white appearance and resistance to atmospheric
tarnishing substantially the same as traditional higher-Ni white copper-base alloys.
[0056]      Tarnishing in copper alloys is the result of the formation of oxide films over
time by reaction with oxygen from the atmosphere. It generally shows up as a darkening
of the surface, although the different colors of the oxides formed from the base material
(as well as interference-layer effects) can also introduce differences in hue and chroma
compared to the original appearance of the material. By comparing colors before and
                                              28

after exposure, the magnitude of tarnishing can be quantified and objective comparisons
made between different alloys.
[0057]      Color differences between samples with measured CIELAB values are readily
calculated; a variety of color-difference and color-tolerance equations are given in ASTM
Standard D2244-07" "Standard Practice for Calculation of Color Tolerances and Color
Differences from Instrumentally Measured Color Coordinates"; ASTM International; May 1,
2007. The total color difference AE*ab between two colors each given in terms of L*, a*, b* can
be calculated as:
       JE*ab   =  [(JL*) 2 + (Ja*)2 +(Jb*)2 m
[0058]      AE*ab provides the magnitude of the color difference but gives no indication of
the character of the difference since it does not indicate the relative quantity and direction
of hue, chroma, and lightness differences. (ASTM Standard D2244-07"', Section 6.2.2). It
is most useful when the color change is dominated by one of the three factors and the
nature of the color change is easily understood but less useful when two or three
components are significant contributors to the measured color change. It is also possible
to transform the L*, a*, b* rectangular coordinates into L*, C*, H* cylindrical
coordinates to better understand the relative differences in lightness L*, chroma C* and
hue H*. The equivalent total color difference equation is then:
       AE*ab = [(ZL*) 2 + (ZAC*)2 +(JH*)2 ]'m

[0059]     An alternate calculated color difference JEcMC (as defined by the Colour
Measurement Committee (CMC) of the Society of Dyers and Colourists in England) is
intended to be used as a single-number shade-passing equation (also defined in ASTM
D2244-071'). It was developed as a tolerancing system based on CIELCH cylindrical
coordinates and defines ellipsoids around a standard color (specific point in color space)
within which the difference from the standard is acceptable for the intended application.
The color difference JECMC is given by:
        JE*MC = cf [(JL*/(LSi))
                                  2
                                    + (J C*/(c -Sc)) 2 + (JH*/(SH)) 2 12
[0060]     Parameters in the equation account for differences in spectral sensitivity and
relative importance of the lightness versus chroma and hue, so that there is better
agreement between numeric tolerances and the actual range of colors visually acceptable
to human perception. In particular, the commercial factor cf can be varied to match the
desired range for a given application. A AEcmc=1 is assumed to represent a just
perceptible difference in color.
[0061]     For purposes of comparing resistance to color change due to atmospheric
exposure, JEcMC was calculated based on the actual color difference between the samples
before exposure (time = 0) and after exposure at a given time and temperature. Lower
values of JEcMC (less color change due to exposure) are considered a measure of
superior atmospheric tarnish resistance.

[0063]     Color change due to atmospheric tarnishing is given in Table 2. After 30 days
at room temperature, many of the nickel-free comparative alloys (Alloys C 11-C24) show
 JECMC >  1. Nickel-containing comparative alloys C3-C8 (with Ni content >4%) all show
less color change, with JECMC < 1. Alloys of the invention (Alloys 11-19) also show
 JECMC < 1, even with Ni <3.5%. Comparing Alloy C16 with Alloy 18, it is expected that

one would see that adding 1% Fe (to a color-balanced Cu-Zn-Mn alloy) may not decrease
tarnish resistance and may move the visual appearance closer to colorless. Similarly
comparing Alloy I7to Alloy C16, it is expected that one would see that addition of 3%
Ni also may give a whiter alloy and significantly improves tarnish resistance. Addition of
both Ni and Fe (Alloy 19) is expected to show that the color and tarnishing benefits of
both elements are independent and may not interfere with each other.

[0064]     Elevated temperatures are often used to simulate longer-term exposures for
purposes of oxidation or corrosion studies. It is important to select temperature-time
                                               32

     WO 2010/030597                                                    PCT/US2009/056201
regimes where the nature of the oxides or corrosion products is the same as under the
conditions being simulated. For example, at moderately elevated temperatures in air
(200'C and above), the direct formation of black CuO is preferred over red CU20 which
later transforms to CuO; this affects the nature of the color change during atmospheric
tarnishing in terms of all three components (hue, chroma, and lightness). These exposures
also indicate how materials will respond when used at moderately elevated temperatures
(such as panels on kitchen appliances) or when subjected to automatic dishwashing or
autoclave sterilization cycles.
[0065]      Color change due to elevated-temperature atmospheric exposure is shown in
Table 3. Alloy samples (also called coupons) were cleaned and prepared by the same
procedure as other color samples and the CIELAB color measured before exposure.
Color was reevaluated after exposure and JEcMC calculated. After furnace treatment at
150'C for either 7 or 24 hours, the alloys of the invention (Alloys 12-19) showed the same
or less color change as any of the comparative copper alloys listed in Table 3 (Alloys C3
C26). The preferred embodiments of the invention (Alloys 17-19) showed the least color
change of any copper alloy listed. Of particular interest is a comparison between Alloy
C16 and these preferred embodiments. Alloy C16 is essentially the same as these
embodiments, but without either Ni or Fe; after 24 hours at 150 C, color change JEcMC
=15.6. For the same alloy with 1% Fe (Alloy 18), JEcMC =11.9, illustrating that addition
of Fe not only improved whiteness of the alloy but enhanced tarnish resistance as well.
The same is true (but more so) for Alloys I7 and 19 (JEcMC =9.1-9.9); addition of Ni (or

Ni plus Fe) to the basic Cu-Zn-Mn alloy dramatically improved tarnish resistance as well
as whiteness of the alloy.
[0066]     Touch surfaces (handrails, door hardware, countertops, appliance panels,
hospital equipment, etc.) are in repeated contact with films of water, sweat, sebum, and
other body fluids as part of their function. These body fluids contain complex mixtures of
substances, many of which are noticeably corrosive to copper and copper alloys. An
evaluation of how the appearance of these alloys changes after repeated contact with
human skin is important not only in selection of these alloys for touch surface
applications but also useful to determine the frequency of cleaning necessary to maintain
their appearance. From a functional standpoint, cleaning and sanitizing cycles ranging
from once per week to multiple times each day are recommended for stainless steel and
similar hospital surfaces to minimize cross-contamination in healthcare situations.

[0067]      Coupons of the alloys of interest were cleaned and prepared with the desired
surface finish (6-18 Ra). Initial color was determined before any contact with human skin
and/or fluids. The coupons were contacted daily, and the change in color determined and
calculated for comparison. Results are given in Table 4. After three days of repeated skin
contact, all white alloys showed little difference in stain resistance; JECMC was 1.2-2.8.
There did not seem to be any strong correlation with content of any particular alloying
element or combination of elements. After seven days of repeated exposure, the
differences between alloys were even less although total color change was greater; JECMC
was 2.9-4.4. Alloys of the invention were no worse than conventional alloys in terms of
resistance to color change due to contact with human skin and/or body fluids, even
though content of Ni and/or Fe was significantly lower than the Ni content of
conventional white copper-base alloys.
[0068]      Many of the applications for copper-based alloys involve conduction of
electricity or resistance to such conduction. For example, controlled electrical

conductivity or resistivity is used as a security feature in discriminating between legal
circulating coinage or tokens and invalid "slugs", where a particular combination of color
and electrical properties are desired. It is also used to control the activity of electrical
equipment such as fuses and circuit breakers. Conductivity is controlled primarily by
alloy content; addition of different alloying elements to pure copper (with 100% IACS
conductivity) will cause more or less reduction in the conductivity. Conductivity of
comparative alloys as well as alloys according to the invention is listed in Table 1.
[0069]      Comparing Alloy C29 (Cu-15Zn, 37% IACS), Alloy C31 (Cu-15Ni, 9.15%
IACS) and Alloy C30 (Cu-12Mn, 4.15% IACS), we see that various alloying elements
have different effects on electrical conductivity. Taking advantage of this, it is possible to
design alloys for a specific conductivity while maintaining a particular visual appearance.
Alloy II has a white visual appearance and electrical conductivity (5.1% IACS) similar to
that of Alloy C5 but it contains only 6% Ni compared to the 24.5% Ni in C5, which could
result in a significant cost savings if substituted in circulating US coinage.
[0070]      Among the advantages of the invention is that the white-colored copper-base
alloy of the invention has antimicrobial properties. Copper and many copper-base alloys,
when properly prepared, decrease the viability of bacteria and other microorganisms
exposed on surfaces of these alloys. The effectiveness of the alloy surface at inactivating
bacteria is related to alloy chemistry as well as other factors, such as surface roughness as
demonstrated in PCT Application _PCT/US 2007/069413. The exposure time necessary
to inactivate 99.9% of bacteria on the surface is a useful measure of the antimicrobial

properties of the alloys under consideration, and a test procedure based on that in the

[0071]     Coupons (~22 mm square) of the alloys of interest were prepared and sterilized
prior to exposure. The prepared coupons were placed in Petri dishes on sterilized filter
paper. A 5-20 tl aliquot of a suspension of active bacterial culture (E. Coli, American
Type Culture Collection [ATCC] strain 11229, Gram-negative) in nutrient broth was
applied onto the surface of the coupon; this inoculum contained a minimum of 106      - 108
colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml). After the desired exposure time, the
coupons were placed in tubes containing 20 ml of sterilized Butterfield's buffer (3. 1x 10
4M  K2HPO 4 in filtered deionized/reverse osmosis laboratory-grade water) and
ultrasonically agitated for 5 minutes to suspend any surviving bacterial colonies from the
surface of the coupons. The suspension of surviving bacterial colonies was serially
diluted four times (1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, and 1/10000). A 20 tl aliquot of this original
suspension and of each dilution was plated onto nutrient agar and incubated at 35-370 C

colonies in the original inoculum exposed on the coupons), a 20 tl aliquot of the original
inoculum was placed into a tube containing 20 ml of sterile buffer directly without
exposure on a metal coupon and this was then treated in identical fashion to the
suspension of survivors from the coupons (ultrasonically agitated, diluted, placed on agar
plates and incubated before counting). Duplicate coupons were exposed and the dilutions

plated in duplicate to average out statistical variation common in biological testing. The
number of colonies present on each agar plate was counted and the number of colony
forming units (CFU) per ml in the original baseline and the suspension from the exposed
coupons calculated, accounting for all dilutions. Only plates exhibiting between 5 and
400 colonies were used for the final calculations, in order to minimize statistical
variability. The exposure time required to achieve a 99.9% reduction in bacteria count
(3logio reduction in CFU) and time to complete inactivation are the primary measures of
antimicrobial effectiveness.

[0074]       Comparative Alloy C32 (Cu-iOZn) shows a 99.9% reduction in bacteria count
after exposures between 90 and 105 minutes and complete inactivation after 105 minutes.

Alloy C4 (Cu-10Ni-1Fe) has essentially the same effectiveness as Alloy C32. Similar
alloys with higher alloy content (C2 [Cu-30Zn] and C5 [Cu-25Ni-0.5Fe]) show slightly
less effectiveness, with 99.9% reduction between 90 and 105 minutes and complete
inactivation only after 120 minutes . Alloy C8 (Cu- 17Zn- 18Ni) is intermediate in
chemistry between these alloys and shows intermediate antimicrobial effectiveness, just
slightly less than C22000 Alloy C32 and Alloy C4. A commercial coinage alloy (Y90
from Olin Brass, Comparative Alloy C3, Cu-12Zn-4Ni-7Mn) also contains Mn like the
alloys of the invention, but is balanced to have a "golden visual appearance" rather than
the substantially white color of the invention. Antimicrobial effectiveness of C3 is
slightly better than alloys without Mn, with 99.9% reduction near 90 minutes exposure
and complete inactivation after 120 minutes. Alloy C1 (commercially pure copper) shows
a 99.9% reduction in bacteria count after exposures between 75 and 90 minutes, with
complete inactivation after 90 minutes.
[0075]      Based on these published results, we expected antimicrobial effectiveness of
the alloys of the invention to be similar to that of Alloy C3 (Y90). The zinc is somewhat
higher (making for longer times, from a comparison of Alloy C32 and Alloy C2) and the
nickel is slightly lower (shorter times, comparing Alloy C4 and C5). Comparing Alloy
C8 and C3, the Mn did not seem to have a strong effect on antimicrobial effectiveness,
although there was a more gradual and earlier drop in bacterial count rather than the
sharp drop seen with most alloys. Unexpectedly, initial testing showed 99.9% reduction
in CFU counts between 45 and 60 minutes (40% faster than other alloys) and complete
                                               39

inactivation after 60 minutes (40-50% faster). Subsequent testing showed a 99.9%
reduction at times as short as 10 minutes or less and complete inactivation between 15
and 30 minutes, and similar results for the same alloys challenged with the Gram-positive
bacteria Staph. Aureus [ATCC 6538] using the same sample preparation and procedures.
The mechanism responsible for the increased kill rates in our modified higher-Mn alloys
is unclear, although it seems to be related to suppression of passivating oxide layers
present on alloys of Cu with Zn and Ni.
