                                             Background of the Invention
                This invention features assays and devices for the detection of analytes, and their use in the
   treatment and diagnosis of disease.
                Magnetic sensors have been designed to detect molecular interactions in a variety of media,
10 including biofluids, food products, and soil samples, among other media. Upon target binding, these
   sensors cause changes in properties of neighboring water molecules (or any solvent molecule with
   free hydrogens) of a sample, which can be detected by magnetic resonance (NMR/MRI) techniques.
   Thus, by using these sensors in a liquid sample, it is possible to detect the presence, and potentially
   quantify the amount, of an analyte at very low concentration. For example, small molecules, DNA,
15 RNA, proteins, carbohydrates, organisms, metabolites, and pathogens (e.g., viruses) can be detected
   using magnetic sensors.
                In general, magnetic sensors are magnetic particles that bind or otherwise link to their
   intended molecular target to form clusters (aggregates). It is believed that when magnetic particles
   assemble into clusters and the effective cross sectional area becomes larger (and the cluster number
20 density is smaller), the interactions with the water or other solvent molecules are altered, leading to a
   change in the measured relaxation rates (e.g., T 2, T 1, T2*), susceptibility, frequency of precession,
   among other physical changes. Additionally, cluster formation can be designed to be reversible (e.g.,
   by temperature shift, chemical cleavage, pH shift, etc.) so that "forward" or "reverse" (competitive
   and inhibition) assays can be developed for detection of specific analytes. Forward (clustering) and
25 reverse (declustering) types of assays can be used to detect a wide variety of biologically relevant
   materials. The MRS (magnetic resonance switch) phenomenon was previously described (see U.S.
   Patent Publication No. 20090029392).
                Many diagnostic assays require sensitivity in the picomolar or subpicomolar range. In such
   assays an equally low concentration of paramagnetic particles is employed. As a result, the binding
30 events leading to cluster formation can become a rate-limiting step in the completion of the assay as
   the collision frequency of antigens, paramagnetic particles, and partially formed clusters is low in this
   concentration range (see Baudry et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 103:16076 (2006)). The current
   detection of infectious agents, nucleic acids, small molecules, biowarfare agents and organisms, and
   molecular targets (biomarkers) or the combination of molecular and immunoassay targets usually
35 requires up-front sample preparation, time to analyze the sample, and single tests for each of the
   individual analytes. There is a need for a rapid, commercially-realizable NMR-based analyte
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   detection device suitable for use with magnetic nanosensors having four unique features and qualities:
    1) little to no sample preparation, 2) multiplex detection across multiple molecular types, 3) rapid
   acquisition of diagnostic information, and 4) accurate information for point-of-care clinical decision
   making.

   not constitute an admission that the publication forms a part of the common general knowledge in the
   art in Australia or any other country.

                In any of the systems, kits, cartridges, and methods of the invention for detection of any
   analyte in a whole blood sample, the disruption of the red blood cells can be carried out using an
   erythrocyte lysis agent (i.e., a lysis buffer, or a nonionic detergent). Erythrocyte lysis buffers which
   can be used in the methods of the invention include, without limitation, isotonic solutions of
 5 ammonium chloride (optionally including carbonate buffer and/or EDTA), and hypotonic solutions.
   Alternatively, the erythrocyte lysis agent can be an aqueous solutions of nonionic detergents (e.g.,
   nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol (NP-40), 4-octylphenol polyethoxylate (Triton-X1OO), Brij-58, or
   related nonionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof). The erythrocyte lysis agent disrupts at least some
   of the red blood cells, allowing a large fraction of certain components of whole blood (e.g., certain
10 whole blood proteins) to be separated (e.g., as supernatant following centrifugation) from the white
   blood cells, yeast cells, and/or bacteria cells present in the whold blood sample. Following
   Erythrocyte lysis and centrifugation, the resulting pellet is reconstituted to form an extract.

20              The methods, kits, cartridges, and systems of the invention can be configured to reduce
   sample to sample variablility by determining a magnetic resonance signal prior to and after
   hybridization. The addition of derivatized nanoparticles to the sample prior to methods to enhance
   clustering may provide a baseline, internal T 2 signal that can either be subtracted or used to modify
   the T 2 signal after analyte-derivatized particle binding and clustering. This method may also be used
25 to determine or manage cartridge to cartridge variability.
                In the claims which follow and in the description of the invention, except where the context
   requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word "comprise" or
   variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e. to specify the
   presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of further features in
30 various embodiments of the invention.

   drug, medication, medicament, or other chemically synthesized compound that is contemplated for
   human therapeutic use. As used herein, the term "biologic" refers to a substance derived from a
   biological source, not synthesized and that is contemplated for human therapeutic use. A "biomarker"
   is a biological substance that can be used as an indicator of a particular disease state or particular
20 physiological state of an organism, generally a biomarker is a protein or other native compound
   measured in bodily fluid whose concentration reflects the presence or severity or staging of a disease

                By an "isolated" nucleic acid molecule is meant a nucleic acid molecule that is removed from
   the environment in which it naturally occurs. For example, a naturally-occurring nucleic acid
   molecule present in the genome of cell or as part of a gene bank is not isolated, but the same
   molecule, separated from the remaining part of the genome, as a result of, e.g., a cloning event,
 5 amplification, or enrichment, is "isolated." Typically, an isolated nucleic acid molecule is free from
   nucleic acid regions (e.g., coding regions) with which it is immediately contiguous, at the 5' or 3'
   ends, in the naturally occurring genome. Such isolated nucleic acid molecules can be part of a vector
   or a composition and still be isolated, as such a vector or composition is not part of its natural
   environment.
10              As used herein, "linked" means attached or bound by covalent bonds, non-covalent bonds,
   and/or linked via Van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds, and/or other intermolecular forces.
                The term "magnetic particle" refers to particles including materials of high positive magnetic
   susceptibility such as paramagnetic compounds, superparamagnetic compounds, and magnetite,
   gamma ferric oxide, or metallic iron.
15              As used herein, "nonspecific reversibility" refers to the colloidal stability and robustness of
   magnetic particles against non-specific aggregation in a liquid sample and can be determined by
   subjecting the particles to the intended assay conditions in the absence of a specific clustering moiety
   (i.e., an analyte or an agglomerator). For example, nonspecific reversibility can be determined by
   measuring the T2 values of a solution of magnetic particles before and after incubation in a uniform
20 magnetic field (defined as <5000 ppm) at 0.45T for 3 minutes at 37 'C. Magnetic particles are
   deemed to have nonspecific reversibility if the difference in T2 values before and after subjectng the
   magnetic particles to the intended assay conditions vary by less than 10% (e.g., vary by less than 9%,
   8%, 6%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or %). If the difference is greater than 10%, then the particles exhibit
   irreversibility in the buffer, diluents, and matrix tested, and manipulation of particle and matrix
25 properties (e.g., coating and buffer formulation) may be required to produce a system in which the
   particles have nonspecific reversibility. In another example, the test can be applied by measuring the
   T2 values of a solution of magnetic particles before and after incubation in a gradient magnetic field
    1Gauss/mm- 1000Gauss/mm.
                As used herein, the term "NMR relaxation rate" refers to a measuring any of the following in
30 a sample T1, T2, T1/T2 hybrid, Tirho,    T2rhio, and T2*. The systems and methods of the invention are
   designed to produce an NMR relaxation rate characteristic of whether an analyte is present in the
   liquid sample. In some instances the NMR relaxation rate is characteristic of the quantity of analyte
   present in the liquid sample.
                As used herein, the term "TI/T  2 hybrid" refers to any detection method that combines a T1 and
35 a T2 measurement. For example, the value of a Ti/T 2 hybrid can be a composite signal obtained
   through the combination of, ratio, or difference between two or more different T1 and T2
                                                          - 39
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   measurements. The T1 /T 2 hybrid can be obtained, for example, by using a pulse sequence in which T1
   and T 2 are alternatively measured or acquired in an interleaved fashion. Additionally, the T 1/T 2
   hybrid signal can be acquired with a pulse sequence that measures a relaxation rate that is comprised
   of both T1 and T 2 relaxation rates or mechanisms.
 5              A "pathogen" means an agent causing disease or illness to its host, such as an organism or
   infectious particle, capable of producing a disease in another organism, and includes but is not limited
   to bacteria, viruses, protozoa, prions, yeast and fungi or pathogen by-products. "Pathogen by
   products" are those biological substances arising from the pathogen that can be deleterious to the host
   or stimulate an excessive host immune response, for example pathogen antigens, metabolic
10 substances, enzymes, biological substances, or toxins.
                By "pathogen-associated analyte" is meant an analyte characteristic of the presence of a
   pathogen (e.g., a bacterium, fungus, or virus) in a sample. The pathogen-associated analyte can be a
   particular substance derived from a pathogen (e.g., a protein, nucleic acid, lipid, polysaccharide, or
   any other material produced by a pathogen) or a mixture derived from a pathogen (e.g., whole cells,
15 or whole viruses). In certain instances, the pathogen-associated analyte is selected to be characteristic
   of the genus, species, or specific strain of pathogen being detected. Alternatively, the pathogen
   associated analyte is selected to ascertain a property of the pathogen, such as resistance to a particular
   therapy. For example, the pathogen-associated analyte can be a gene, such as a Van A gene or Van B
   gene, characteristic of vancomycin resistance in a number of different bacterial species.
20              By "pulse sequence" or "RF pulse sequence" is meant one or more radio frequency pulses to
   be applied to a sample and designed to measure, e.g., certain NMR relaxation rates, such as spin echo
   sequences. A pulse sequence may also include the acquisition of a signal following one or more
   pulses to minimize noise and improve accuracy in the resulting signal value.
                As used herein, the term "signal" refers to an NMR relaxation rate, frequency shift,
25 susceptibility measurement, diffusion measurement, or correlation measurements.
                As used herein, reference to the "size" of a magnetic particle refers to the average diameter
   for a mixture of the magnetic particles as determined by microscopy, light scattering, or other
   methods.
                As used herein, the term "substantially monodisperse" refers to a mixture of magnetic
30 particles having a polydispersity in size distribution as determined by the shape of the distribution
   curve of particle size in light scattering measurements. The FWHM (full width half max) of the
   particle distribution curve less than 25% of the peak position is considered substantially
   monodisperse. In addition, only one peak should be observed in the light scattering experiments and
   the peak position should be within one standard deviation of a population of known monodisperse
35 particles.

                By "T 2 relaxivity per particle" is meant the average T 2 relaxivity per particle in a population
   of magnetic particles.
                As used herein, "unfractionated" refers to an assay in which none of the components of the
   sample being tested are removed following the addition of magnetic particles to the sample and prior
 5 to the NMR relaxation measurement.

                Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed
   description, the drawings, and the claims.
                                           Brief Description of the Drawings
20              Figure IA is a schematic diagram of an NMR unit for detection of a signal response of a
   sample to an RF pulse sequence, according to an illustrative embodiment of the invention.
                Figure lB depicts a typical coil configuration surrounding a sample tube for measuring a
   relaxation signal in a 20 pL sample.
                Figures 2A-2E illustrate micro coil geometries which can be used in NMR (for excitation
25 and/or detection); designs include, but are not limited to a wound solenoid coil (Figure 2A), a planar
   coil (Figure 2B), a MEMS solenoid coil (Figure 2C), a MEMS Helmholz coil (Figure 2D), and a
   saddle coil (Figure 2E), according to an illustrative embodiment of the invention. Three dimensional
   lithographic coil fabrication of well characterized coils used in MR detection is also established and
   can be used for these applications, Demas et al. "Electronic characterization of lithographically
30 patterned microcoils for high sensitivity NMR detection" J Magn Reson 200:56 (2009).
                Figure 3 is a drawing depicting an aggregation assay of the invention. The magnetic particles
   (dots) are coated with a binding agent (i.e., antibody, oligo, etc.) such that in the presence of analyte,
   or multivalent binding agent, aggregates are formed. The dotted circles represent the diffusion sphere
   or portion of the total fluid volume that a solution molecule may experience via its diffusion during a
35 T2 measurement (the exact path travelled by a water molecule is random, and this drawing is not to

   scale). Aggregation (right hand side) depletes portions of the sample from the microscopic magnetic
   non-uniformities that disrupt the water's T 2 signal, leading to an increase in T2 relaxation.
                Figures 4A-4E are a series of graphs depicting the dependence of transverse relaxivity (R 2 )
   (Figure 4A) or T2 (Figures 4B-4E) on particle diameter and particle aggregation. Figure 4A is a
 5 graph depicting the motional averaging regime (light line, left side); the R 2 (1/T 2) measured by a
   CPMG sequence increases as particle size increases because the refocusing pulses are ineffective to
   counteract the dephasing effects of the particles. As the system transitions to the visit limited regime
   (dark line, right side) the refocusing pulses begin to become effective and the R 2 decreases as particle
   size increases. For homogeneous magnetic fields, the R2* in the motional averaging regime matches
10 the R 2 and the R2* reaches a constant value in the visit limited regime. In a homogenous field, when
   the R2* is less than the R2 of either the motional averaging regime or visit limited regime the system is
   in the static dephasing regime. The empty circle represents the R2 of a solution of 100% dispersed
   particles (diameter = 15 nm) and the solid circle represents a solution of 100% clustered particles
   (diameter = 200 nm). This is an example of how to interpret these curves for clustering reactions.
15 The conditions for this curve are 0.1 mM4 Fe, Ao = 8.85x 106, D = 2.5x 10- m 2/s, and TCP = 0.25 ms.
   Figure 4B is a graph depicting the same light and dark curves plotted in terms of T2 and diameter, on
   a linear scale. In this figure the black dashed line represents the T2* measured in a non-uniform
   magnetic field where T2* is always lower than T2 and doesn't reflect the particle size. The data points
   are the same as well. Figure 4C is a graph depicting the monodisperse clustering model and showing
20 that T2 will follow the curve as analyte is added because the average diameter of the population
   particles will cover all intermediate diameters between the initial and final states. Figure 4D is a
   graph depicting the polydisperse model and showing that the T2 will transition between the two points
   on this curve when particles form clusters of specific sizes. The response curve will be linear with
   regard to analyte addition, but non-linear with regard to volume fraction of clusters, because particles
25 transition between state 1 and state 2. The slope of the response curve is directly proportional to the
   sensitivity of the assay. Figure 4E is a graph showing the two regimes for particle aggregation and T2
   affects based on particle size and how clustering assays in the different regimes map onto the T2
   versus diameter curves (i) for the motional averaging regime T2 decreases when particles cluster; and
   (ii) for the slow motion regime T2 increases when particles cluster. Under the conditions shown in
30 these models, the boundary between the two regimes is ca. 100 nm diameter particles. When small
   magnetic particles form aggregates under 100 nm in diameter, the result is a decrease in T2 upon
   aggregate formation. When magnetic particles at or above 100 nm in diameter form larger
   aggregates, the result is an increase in T2 upon aggregate formation.

   particles are designed to bind to two different epitopes of an analyte. Figure 5B depicts a competitive

   immunoassay in which analyte in a liquid sample binds to a multivalent binding agent (a multivalent
   antibody), thereby inhibiting aggregation. Figure 5C depicts a hybridization-mediated agglomerative
   assay in which two populations of particles are designed to bind to the first and second portions of a
   nucleic acid target, respectively.
 5              Figure 6 illustrates a modular cartridge concept in sections that can be packaged and stored
   separately. This is done, for example, so that the inlet module (shown elevated with inverted
   Vacutainer tube attached) can be sterilized while the reagent holding module in the middle is not.
   This allows the component containing reagents to be the only refrigerated component.
                Figures 7A-7F depict a Vacutainer inlet module. Figure 7A shows it in the inverted position
10 after the user has removed the closure from the Vacutainer tube and placed the cartridge onto it.
   Figure 7B shows the molded in path that the blood will follow out of the Vacutainer and into the
   sample loading region once the cartridge is turned right side up. The foil seal can be the bottom side
   of the channels, forming an inexpensively molded part with closed channels. Figure 7C is a cutaway
   view showing the vent tube which allows air to enter into the vial as the blood leaves and fills the
15 sample region. Figures 7D-7F depict an inlet module for sample aliquoting designed to interface with
   uncapped vacutainer tubes, and to aliquot two a sample volume that can be used to perform, for
   example, a candida assay. The inlet module has two hard plastic parts, that get ultrasonically welded
   together and foil sealed to form a network of channels to allow a flow path to form into the first well
   overflow to the second sample well. A soft vacutainer seal part is used to for a seal with the
20 vacutainer. It has a port for sample flow, and a venting port, to allow the flow to occur.
                Figure 8 depicts the sample inlet module with the foil seal removed. On the top, one can see
   the small air inlet port to the left, the larger sample well in the center and a port which connects them
   together. This port provides a channel through which air can flow once the foil seal is pierced. It also
   provides an overflow into the body of the module to allow excess blood to drain away and not spill
25 over. This effectively meters the blood sample to the volume contained in the sample well.
                Figures 9A-9C depict a reagent module. Figure 9A depicts the module of the cartridge that is
   intended to hold reagents and consumables for use during the assay. On the left are sealed pre
   dispensed aliquots of reagents. On the right is a 2.8 ml conical bottomed centrifuge tube that is used
   for initial centrifugation of the blood. The other holes can be filled as need with vials,
30 microcentrifuge tubes, and pipette tips. Figure 9B is a cutaway view of the reagent module showing
   the holders for the pre-aliquoted reagent tips, including the feature at the bottom into which the tips
   are pressed to provide a seal. Figure 9C depicts three representative pipette tips into which reagents
   can be pre-dispensed, and then the backs sealed. The tips are pressed into the sample holder to
   provide a seal.

   detection module with a recessed well for use in assays that require PCR. Cross-contamination from

   PCR products is controlled in two ways. First, the seals that are on the detection tubes are designed to
   seal to a pipette tip as it penetrates. Second, the instrument provides air flow through the recessed
   well by means of holes in the well to ensure that any aerosol is carried down and does not travel
   throughout the machine.
 5              Figure 11 depicts a detection module of cartridge showing detection tubes and one of the
   holes used to ensure air flow down and over the tubes during pipetting to help prevent aerosol escape.
                Figure 12 depicts a bottom view of the detection module, showing the bottom of the detection
   tubes and the two holes used to ensure airflow. An optional filter can be inserted here to capture any
   liquid aerosol and prevent it from entering the machine. This filter could also be a sheet of a
10 hydrophobic material like Gore-tex that will allow air but not liquids to escape.
                Figures 13A-13C depict a detection tube. Figure 13A is a view of the detection tube. The
   tube itself could be an off the shelf 200 microliter PCR tube, while the cap is a custom molded
   elastomer part that provides a pressure resistant duckbill seal on the inside and a first seal to the
   pipette tip from the top. The seal is thus a make-break type of seal, where one seal is made before the
15 other is broken. Figure 13B depicts the custom molded seal component. Note the circular hole into
   which the pipette tip is inserted and the duckbill seal below, which provides a second seal that resists
   pressure developed in the tube. Figure 13C depicts the seal showing the duckbill at bottom and the
   hole at top.
                Figures 14A-14C depict a cartridge for performing a multiplexed assay. Figure 14A shows a
20 reagent strip for the cartridge. The oval holes are the supports for the detection modules, and these
   are constructed separately and then placed into the holes. The detection wells could be custom
   designed or commercially available. Figure 14B shows the detection module for the cartridge
   depicted in Figure 14A. In this example, the detection module contains two detection chambers, but
   could contain any number of chambers as required by the assay and as the detection system (the MR
25 reader) is designed to accept. Figure 14C depicts an alternate footprint for the modular multiplexed
   cartridge. This cartridge includes 3 detection modules that are molded as part of the reagent strip, and
   these portions are popped out of the frame and individually processed at other units (i.e., the NMR
   unit and/or magnetic assisted agglomeration (MAA) unit) within the assay system.
                Figure 15 is a scheme depicting one embodiment of the cycling gradient magnetic assisted
30 agglomeration (gMAA) method of the invention. Two magnets are placed in two positions such that
   if the sample tube is placed close to the a region of strong magnetic field gradient produced by the
   first magnet, the magnetic particles will be drawn towards the direction of the field gradient produced
   by the first magnet, the sample tube is then placed next to the second magnet producing a field
   gradient, and the magnetic particles are drawn to the direction of the field gradient produced by
35 second magnet. The cycle can be repeated until the aggregation reaction reaches a steady state (as
   observed by the change in the NMR relaxation rate of the sample); a smaller number of cycles can be

   used as well. A single magnet used to produce a field gradient can also be used, while for cycling the
   sample tube can be moved relative to the magnetic field gradient.
                Figure 16 is a scheme depicting a homogenous magnetic assisted agglomeration (hMAA)
   setup. On the left hand side, the magnetic particles are shown as dots in a partially clustered state.
 5 When exposed to a homogeneous magnetic field, as depicted on the right hand side, clustering of the
   magnetic particles is promoted as the magnetic particles form chains along the direction of the field
   produced by the hMAA setup. On the right hand side, the two magnets are represented by bars, to
   depict the formation of a standard dipole field. hMAA can also be used to evaluate the nonspecific
   reversibility of a magnetic particle to assess its utility in an assay of the invention.
10              Figure 17 depicts a gradient MAA unit configured to apply a gradient magnetic field to the
   side and to the bottom of a sample. The specific setup has magnets with a surface field of
   approximately 0.7 T, while the produced gradient is in the order of 0.25 T/mm. Similar gMAA units,
   covering a much bigger range of fields and gradients can be used.
                Figures 18A- 18C depict a gradient MAA unit configured to apply a gradient magnetic field to
15 the side and to the bottom of an array of samples. Figure 18A depicts the gMAA unit array of 32
   bottom magnets and 40 side magnets (32 functional, 8 used to balance the stray magnetic fields seen
   by all sample), each with a field strength of about 0.5T, used for assisting agglomeration in an array
   of samples simultaneously. Figures 18B- 18C depict a top view (Figure 18B) and side view (Figure
    18C) of a setup for the automation of the an automated gMAA unit wherein a plate gMAA along with
20 a configuration for containing an array of samples is cycled between the bottom and side magnet
   positions by a robotic systems, within a temperature controlled array. The magnets are stationary,
   while the plate holding the sample tubes moves through a preset trajectory. An exemplary field
   strength on the surface of individual magnets is 0.4-0.5 T, with a gradient in the order of 0.1T/mm.
                Figures 19A- 19B depict a top view (Figure 19A) and side view (Figure 19B) of a
25 homogenous MAA unit configured to apply a homogenous magnetic field to an array samples. Field
   strengths from 0.2-0.7T can be used with homogeneity from 500 to 5000 ppm over the sample tube
   region.

   motor includes an index mark and/or other position sensing means such as an optical, magnetic or
   resitive position encoder that allows the motor to find a specific point in its rotation. These index
   marks are used to home the system, and ensure that the sample can be returned to a known position
   after mixing and allows the vortexer to be easily accessed by robotic actuators, and thus integrated
 5 into an automated system. In lieu of index marks, external home switches or position tracking sensors
   could be employed. Figure 22B is a drawing depicting the guide mechanism of a vortexer of the
   invention. The main plate is connected to the offset axis of the drive shaft and is free to rotate. The
   plate follows the orbital path around and dictated by the motor shaft.

   section view showing two tube holders for small tubes. Figure 23C is an overall view of vortexer
   showing four tubes and a close up of planetary belt drive mechanism.
                Figure 24 is a drawing depicting the components of the creatinine competitive assay of
   Example 6. A magnetic particle decorated with creatinine is used in combination with a creatinine
15 antibody to form an aggregating system. The creatinine present in a liquid sample competes with the
   magnetic particles for the antibody, leading to a reduction in aggregation with increasing creatinine
   concentration. The change in aggregation is observed as a change in the T 2 relaxation rate of the
   hydrogen nuclei in the water molecules of the liquid sample. By comparing the observed T 2
   relaxation rate of the liquid sample to a standard curve, the concentration of creatinine is determined.
20              Figures 25A-25C are a series of graphs showing the response curve for creatinine competitive
   assays. Figure 25A is a graph showing a standard curve for the creatinine competitive assay of
   Example 6 correlating the observed T 2 relaxation rate with the concentration of creatinine in the liquid
   sample. Figure 25B shows the T 2 response of a creatinine-decorated particle with 2 different
   preparations of antibody. Preparation 1 is pre-production (with aggregated antibody) and Preparation
25 2 is production purified (no aggregated antibody present). Figure 25C shows the T 2 response of a
   creatinine-decorated particle with unaggregated antibody, biotinylated antibody and deliberately
   multimerized antibody, and confirms the increased clustering ability of multi-valent agglomerating
   agents.
                Figure 26 is a graph showing the specific clustering achieved, as determined via T 2 relaxation
30 rates, with various methods of gMAA as described in Example 10. In Figure 26 (i) "control" is
   gMAA (magnet exposure + vortex, repeat) in which the relative position of the sample and the
   magnetic field direction are unchanged with each cycle; (ii) "twist" is gMAA (magnet exposure +
   rotation within magnet, repeat) with rotating tube ca. 900 relative to the gradient magnet with each
   cycle; (iii) " 180' turn" is gMAA (magnet exposure + remove tube from magnet, rotate, place back in
35 magnet, repeat) with rotating tube ca. 180' relative to the gradient magnet with each cycle; and
   "remove 5 s" is removal of tube from magnet, 5 seconds rest (no rotation), repeat. The results show

   that the rate at which a steady state degree of agglomeration, and stable T 2 reading, is achieved is
   expedited by cycling between the two or more positions over a number of gMAA treatments. Further,
   field gradient combinations, cycling field (side or bottom) to null or side field to bottom, field (side or
   bottom) to vortex are also iterations that can be used for gMAA. Exposure or dwell times (either on
 5 the field or away), and number of cycles can be varied to optimize assisted aggregation for a specific
   assay (not shown).

                Figures 30A-30B are graphs depicting the degree to which gMAA assisted aggregation is
   dependent upon temperature and dwell time in the assay of Example 11. Figure 30A is a graph
15 showing that the degree of aggregation as determined by measuring the T 2 response of the sample is
   increased with increasing dwell time at room temperature. Figure 30B is a graph showing that the
   degree of aggregation as determined by measuring the T 2 response of the sample is increased with
   increasing gMAA dwell time at 37 C. As shown in Figures 30A and 30B, increasing temperature
   and increasing dwell time enhance the extent of gMAA assisted aggregation as observed by changes
20 in the observed T2 .

   measurement on C. albicans infected human whole blood, we conducted an eight day study in which
   the same donor spiked and amplified sample was hybridized to the superparamagnetic particles (n=3)
30 each day and the resulting T2 values were recorded (see Example 17). The within run precision is
   shown in Figure 46A and in general is tight with the CV's of all measurands less than 12%. The
   repeatability observed over the course of eight days is shown in Figure 46B (Mean T2 values +/- the
   95% confidence intervals measured from the same donor spiked and amplified samples over the
   course of eight days) with the CVs less than 10% across the range of Candida concentrations and 6%

 5 different donor blood samples spiked with a range of C. albicans cells (see Example 17). Each data
   point is the mean +/- the 95% confidence interval (n=48). At the lowest test concentration (10
   cells/mL), we failed to detect Candida albicans 37% of the time (6 out of 16 experiments); however at
    100 cells/mL Candida albicans was detected 100% of the time. This suggests the assay can robustly
   detect at C. albicans concentrations greater than or equal to 100 cells/mL with no major inhibition of
10 performance introduced through the donor blood samples. Figure 48B is a graph depicting the results
   obtained from 7 experiments designed to assess the assay's performance in 6 different donor blood
   samples spiked with a range of C. krusei cells (see Example 17). Each data point is the mean +/- the
   95% confidence interval (n=21). We do not detect at 10 cells/mL in any of the experimental runs but
   detect at 100 cells/mL for all experimental runs. This suggests the LOD between 10 and 100
15 cells/mL.
                Figure 49 is a dot diagram showing the T2 values measured for five C. albicans clinical
   isolates spiked into 400 piL whole blood at concentrations spanning 0 to 1E4 cells/mL. The plotted
   results are the mean +/- 1SD. The data indicates despite the scatter of absolute T2 values obtained
   among the different isolates, at 50 cells/mL all values are above that of the no Candida control (3
20 replicate measurements from 20 independent assays, total of 60 different clustering reactions).
                Figures 50A and 50B are ROC plots of T2 results generated at 10 cells/mL (Figure 50A) and
   50 cells/mL (Figure 50B). The area under the curve at 10 cells/mL is 0.72 (95CI= 0.56 to 0.88) while
   at 50 cells/mL the area under the curve is 0.98 (95CI= 0.95 to 1.001). The area under the curve is
   often used to quantify the diagnostic accuracy; in this case our ability to discriminate between a
25 Candidemic patient with an infection of 10 cells/mL or 50 cells/mL versus a patient with no
   Candidemia. At 10 cells/mL the area under the curve is 0.72 which means that if the T2 assay was
   run on a randomly chosen person with Candidemia at a level of infection of 10 cells/mL, there is an
   72% chance their T2 value would be higher than a person with no Candidemia. The clinical accuracy
   of the test is much higher at 50 cells/mL with the area under the curve at 0.98. Again indicating that
30 in a person with Candidemia at this level of infection, the T2 assay would give a value higher than a
   sample from a patient without Candidemia 98% of the time. See Example 17.

   magnetizable metal foam (shaded), magnetic particles (circles), and analyte (triangles). a
   magnetizable metal foam, e.g., made of nickel, may be inserted into a conduit and immobilized by
   exposure to heat, which shrinks the conduit around the metal foam, resulting in a tight seal. A sample
15 containing magnetic particles and analytes is then introduced at one end of the conduit (Figure 55A).
   Next, the conduit is exposed to a magnet (Figure 55B), and the magnetic particles are attracted to the
   metal foam and become magnetically trapped within its pores, or crevices. The average diameter of
   the pores in the metal foam is, e.g., between 100-1000 microns. Analyte molecules can be carried to
   the metal foam via binding to a magnetic particle, or the fluid can be forced through the metal foam to
20 reach trapped magnetic particles. While trapped in the metal foam, the magnetic particles have
   enhanced interactions, as they are now confined and are closer to other magnetic particles, and cluster
   formation is enhanced. The metal foam is then demagnetized (Figure 55C), i.e., the magnetic field of
   the metal foam becomes negligible. The magnetic particles and analyte cluster complexes largely
   remain in the metal foam, as the diffusion of magnetic particle clusters is relatively low, although
25 some natural diffusion of the analyte in to and out of the metal foam occurs (Figure 55D).
   Alternatively, the magnetizable metal foam (hollow cylinder) is free floating in the sample tube with
   the magnetic particles (circles), and analyte (stars). The magnetization and demagnetization of the
   free floating metal foam is used to increase the rate of aggregate formation.
                Figure 56A depicts a rotary gMAA configuration. The Rotary gMAA can include three
30 configurations for varying magnetic field exposures - side-bottom; side-null and bottom-null (see
   Example 21).
                Figure 56B is a graph comparing T2 signal as a function of various rotary gMAA
   configurations for varying magnetic field exposures to a sample at a given agglomerator
   concentration. The rotary side-bottom configuration provided the highest T2 signal at a given
35 agglomerator concentration, followed by the comparison side-bottom plate configuration. Rotary

   side-null provides equivalent signal to the plate side-bottom; and the bottom-null produces the lowest
   signal (see Example 21).

                                                  Detailed Description
                The invention features systems, devices, and methods for the rapid detection of analytes or
10 determination of analyte concentration in a sample. The systems and methods of the invention
   employ magnetic particles, an NMR unit, optionally one or more MAA units, optionally one or more
   incubation stations at different temperatures, optionally one or more vortexer, optionally one or more
   centrifuges, optionally a fluidic manipulation station, optionally a robotic system, and optionally one
   or more modular cartridges. The systems, devices, and methods of the invention can be used to assay
15 a biological sample (e.g., blood, sweat, tears, urine, saliva, semen, serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid
   (CSF), feces, vaginal fluid or tissue, sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirate or swab, lacrimal fluid, mucous,
   or epithelial swab (buccal swab), tissues, organs, bones, teeth, or tumors, among others).
   Alternatively, the systems, devices, and methods of the invention are used to monitor an
   environmental condition (e.g., plant growth hormone, insecticides, man-made or environmental
20 toxins, nucleic acid sequences that are important for insect resistance/susceptibility, algae and algae
   by-products), as part of a bioremediation program, for use in farming plants or animals, or to identify
   environmental hazards. Similarily, the systems, devices, and methods of the invention are used to
   detect and monitor biowarfare or biological warfare agents, such as ricin, Salmonella typhimurium,
   botulinum toxin, aflatoxin, mycotoxins, Francisella tularesis, small pox, anthrax, or others.
25              The magnetic particles can be coated with a binding moiety (i.e., antibody, oligo, etc.) such
   that in the presence of analyte, or multivalent binding agent, aggregates are formed. Aggregation
   depletes portions of the sample from the microscopic magnetic non-uniformities that disrupt the
   solvent's T2 signal, leading to an increase in T2 relaxation (see Figure 3).
                The T2 measurement is a single measure of all spins in the ensemble, measurements lasting
30 typically 1-10 seconds, which allows the solvent to travel hundreds of microns, a long distance
   relative to the microscopic non-uniformities in the liquid sample. Each solvent molecule samples a
   volume in the liquid sample and the T2 signal is an average (net total signal) of all (nuclear spins) on
   solvent molecules in the sample; in other words, the T2 measurement is a net measurement of the
   entire environment experienced by a solvent molecule, and is an average measurement of all
35 microscopic non-uniformities in the sample.

                The observed T2 relaxation rate for the solvent molecules in the liquid sample is dominated by
   the magnetic particles, which in the presence of a magnetic field form high magnetic dipole moments.
   In the absence of magnetic particles, the observed T 2 relaxation rates for a liquid sample are typically
   long (i.e., T2 (water) = -2000 ms, T 2 (blood) = -1500 ms). As particle concentration increases, the
 5 microscopic non-uniformities in the sample increase and the diffusion of solvent through these
   microscopic non-uniformities leads to an increase in spin decoherence and a decrease in the T 2 value.
   The observed T 2 value depends upon the particle concentration in a non-linear fashion, and on the
   relaxivity per particle parameter.
                In the aggregation assays of the invention, the number of magnetic particles, and if present
10 the number of agglomerant particles, remain constant during the assay. The spatial distribution of the
   particles change when the particles cluster. Aggregation changes the average "experience" of a
   solvent molecule because particle localization into clusters is promoted rather than more even particle
   distributions. At a high degree of aggregation, many solvent molecules do not experience
   microscopic non-uniformities created by magnetic particles and the T 2 approaches that of solvent. As
15 the fraction of aggregated magnetic particles increases in a liquid sample, the observed T 2 is the
   average of the non-uniform suspension of aggregated and single (unaggregated) magnetic particles.
   The assays of the invention are designed to maximize the change in T2 with aggregation to increase
   the sensitivity of the assay to the presence of analytes, and to differences in analyte concentration.
                In designing magnetic relaxation switch (MRSw) biosensors, it is important to consider the
20 relaxation mechanisms of the magnetic particles. First, in the case of superparamagnetic particles the
   solvent longitudinal and transverse relaxivities (defined as R1 = 1/T1 and R2 = 1/T 2, respectively) are a
   function of particle size. Furthermore, R2 and R2* (where R2*=I/T2*, R2*=R2+AO>F, where AO>F is
   dephasing due to field inhomgeneities) increase with particle diameter until about 100 nm, and then
   R2 decreases with increasing particle size and the R2* reaches a plateau for uniform fields (see Figure
25 4A). Superparamagnetic particles are typically divided into categories of strongly magnetized and
   weakly magnetized particles, based on the relative magnitude of the precession frequency difference
   between nuclei at the surface of the particle and nuclei distant from the particle, Aw, and the inter
   echo delay of the CPMG detection sequence, Tcp. Aw is essentially a relative measure of the effect of
   the dipolar magnetic field generated by a superparamagnetic particle on the resonant frequency of
30 hydrogen nuclei in adjacent water molecules. When the product AwrCp > 1 then the particles are
   classified as strongly magnetized and when ACoP < 1 then the particles are classified as weakly
   magnetized. For typical relaxometers, rCp is no shorter than tens of microseconds, so A w must be less
   than 105 for the particles to be within the weakly magnetized regime. Most superparamagnetic
   particles used for MRSw assays have a surface dephasing A w of approximately 1x 107, therefore they
                                                         - 52
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   are classified as strongly magnetized. This means that the inter-echo delay is always longer than the
   amount of dephasing that occurs at the surface of a particle.
                Another characteristic of superparamagnetic particle solutions that is used to differentiate
   physical behavior is the diffusion time, or travel time, of water (rD) relative to the inter-echo time of
 5 the pulse sequence, rCp. Particle solutions are in the long echo limit when the rD is significantly less
   than that rcp. rD can be determined by the relationship:
                                                                      R2
                                                               TD=               (1),
                                                                      D
   where rD is the time it takes a water molecule to diffuse the distance of a particle radius, R, and D the
   diffusion constant of water, 10- m2 /s.              rD can be thought of as the time it takes a water molecule to
10 pass a hemisphere of a particle, or a flyby time. When                tD  is much larger than tcp, then the particle
   system is within the "short echo limit". Typical CPMG sequences have echo times on the order of
   hundreds of microseconds to several milliseconds. Therefore, the "short echo limit" cannot be
   approached unless the particle diameter approaches 1000 nm. The most common MRSw biosensors
   are within the "long echo limit" because the length of the inter-echo delays (rcp> 0.25 ms) is longer
15 than the time it takes a water molecule to diffuse past the hemisphere of a particle (0.2 - 100
   microseconds).
                As the particle size of a solution of superparamagnetic particles at fixed iron concentration is
   increased there is an initial increase in R2, then a plateau and later decrease (Figure 4A). The regime
   on the left hand side of the curve is been termed the motional averaging regime, the regime in the
20 middle is been termed the static dephasing regime, and the regime on the right is been termed the visit
   limited, or slow motion regime. The boundaries between the motional averaging and visit limited
   regimes can be determined by generating plots such as that shown in Figure 4A, or they can be
   determined by the relationship between Aw and rD. If ArD < 1, then the system is in the motional
   averaging regime; if A wrD > 1, then the system is in the visit limited regime (also termed the slow
25 motion regime). As the diameter of the particles increases in the motional averaging regime the
   refocusing echos in the CPMG pulse sequence cannot efficiently refocus the magnetization that has
   been dephased by the particles, hence the increase in R2 (or decrease in T 2 ). In other words, the
   refocusing pulses cannot compensate for increased dephasing by larger particles. The flat region of
   the static dephasing regime is due to the              R2 being limited by R2*. The decreasing     R2 with increasing
30 diameter in the visit limited regime results in the refocusing pulses being able to refocus the
   dephasing caused by the particles. Also apparent in Figure 4A is that the                 R2 in the slow motion
   regime exhibits a dependence on the inter-echo delay of the spin echo sequence.
                In a homogenous magnetic field, one can determine which regime applies to a sample by
   comparing the             R2   to the R2*; the two values are identical in the motional averaging or static dephasing
                                                                  - 53
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   regime and they are different in the visit limited regime. However, in cases of inhomogeneous fields,
   such as those present on benchtop and portable MR devices, the T2* is dominated by the field
   gradient. In fact, the measured T2* value is not indicative of the particle or particle cluster size state
   (Figure 4B).
 5              The shape of the R 2 response as particles agglomerated generally matches the expected trend
   for the increase in average particle size. The similarity between the R 2 of particle agglomerates and
   that of spherical particles suggests that one can equate particle aggregates and spherical shapes. Even
   though this assumption may seem to be in contradiction with the fractal nature of particle
   agglomerates, the shape of the particle aggregates observed by the magnetic resonance measurement
10 is determined by the ensemble of diffusing water molecules in solution, which can be approximated
   by the radius of hydration measured by light scattering.
                The analytical models for R 2 can be applied to magnetic relaxation biosensors to aid in the
   design of biosensor assays. Conveniently, these models accurately predict the dependence of R 2 on
   parameters that a biosensor designer can control-iron concentration, temperature, magnetic
15 susceptibility, and particle size. Additionally, these analytical models allow for predictive modeling
   of the dependence of T 2 relaxation on these parameters. Results are not entirely quantitative, but the
   general trends and response curves predicted by these models can be instructive. One useful model is
   the chemical exchange model for strongly magnetized spheres:
                                                                     2

   the inter-echo delay in a CPMG sequence, and a and b are derived constants (a = 1.34 and b = 0.99).
   Equations (2) and (3) can be used to generate a curve that describes the dependence of R 2 on particle
25 sizes, as shown by the light and dark lines in Figures 4A and 4B (dark line on right side of the curve;
   light line on left side of the curve).
                A modification of Equation 2 can be used to generate a plot that is more intuitive to an assay
   developer. This plot is in terms of T 2 and particle diameter with linear units rather than logarithmic
   units (Figure 2). As discussed above, magnetic relaxation biosensor assays function due to a
30 transition between dispersed and clustered states. For a given agglomerative assay, the measured T 2
   can follow one of two pathways over the course of an analyte titration. The population of dispersed
   particles can cluster in a uniform manner leading to an increase in average particle size that is
   proportional to the amount of analyte that has been added. This type of agglomeration is termed the
                                                                -   54

   monodisperse model because it would lead to a monodisperse intermediate population of particles. In
   this case, T2 would be expected to decrease as particle size increases as long as the system is within
   the motional averaging regime. As the system approaches and enters the visit limited regime the T2
   would increase with particle size (Figure 4C).
 5              A different type of agglomeration that may occur is one in which the addition of analyte seeds
   the self-assembly of clusters, a process with energetics similar to crystal formation or fractal
   aggregation. For this model one would expect a preferred size for particle clusters that depended on
   the conditions of the solution. Systems that followed this model would exhibit polydisperse
   intermediate populations; one would find a mixture of particles with discrete sizes. Given two
10 discrete populations, dispersed particles and clustered particles, the system would transition between
   the T2 value of the starting monodisperse population of unclustered particles and the final T2 value of
   the fully clustered particles. For both models, full titration may lead to a monodisperse solution of
   clustered particles. Although the exact energetics, kinetics, and thermodynamics of particle
   agglomeration will depend on characteristics of the assay system such as valency and binding
15 affinities, these two models are instructive in understanding the dependencies and possible scenarios
   one may encounter during MRSw biosensor design.
                There are two regimes for particle clustering and T2 affects based on particle size (see Figure
   4D, the boundary is typically ca. 100 nm diameter particles). For any given assay of a liquid sample
   the particle count for 250 nm sized magnetic particles can be ca. I x 107 particles, whereas for 30 nm
20 sized magnetic particles can be ca. IX1013. This is because the smaller particles have a lower
   relaxivity per particle (for the same type of material), resulting in an inherent sensitivity disadvantage.
   In a typical assay of the invention, the magnetic particles are selected such that T2 increases with an
   increase in the fraction of aggregated particles.
                The assay of the invention can be designed to change the direction of T2 in the presence of
25 analyte (see Figures 5A-5C). For example, the assay can be an agglomerative sandwich
   immunoassay in which two populations of magnetic particles bind to different epitopes of an analyte
   (see Figure 5A); a competitive assay in which analyte competes with a multivalent binding agents to
   inhibit the aggregation of magnetic particles (see Figure 5B); or a hybridization-mediated
   agglomeration in which two populations of magnetic particles bind to a first and second portion of an
30 oligonucleotide (see Figure 5C). Additional competitive format might include when two particles
   binding moieties bind without agglomerator (e..g. the DNA oligonucleotides are designed so that two
   nanoparticles have two different oligos and they can anneal together and when heated the analyte or
   amplicon or target DNA competes or disrupts the np annealing).
                Other formats for carrying out the assays of the invention can be used, such as: (i) a target
35 sample can be incubated in the presence of a magnetic particle that has been decorated with binding
   moieties specific to a target analyte and a multivalent binding agent, in an inhibition assay the binding
                                                         - 55
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   of the analyte to the magnetic particles blocks agglomeration of the magnetic particles with the
   multivalent binding agent; (ii) a target sample can be incubated in the presence of a magnetic particle
   that has been decorated with binding moieties specific to a target analyte and a multivalent binding
   agent, in a disaggregation assay the analyte is exposed to a pre-formed aggregate of the multivalent
 5 binding agent and the magnetic particle and the analyte displaces the multivalent binding agent to
   reduce aggregation in the liquid sample; or (iii) a target sample can be incubated in the presence of a
   magnetic particle that has been decorated with binding moieties specific to a target analyte and the
   target analyte itself to form a self-assembling single population of magnetic particles, in an inhibition
   assay or disaggregation assay the presence the binding of the analyte to the magnetic particles blocks
10 the self agglomeration of the magnetic particles; or (iv) a target sample can be incubated in the
   presence of a soluble agglomerating agent and a magnetic particle decorated with the analyte or
   analog of the analyte, in an inhibition assay the presence of the analyte binds the soluble
   agglomerating agent blocking the agglomeration of the particles.
                Where a multivalent binding agent (agglomerant) is employed, multiple analytes are linked to
15 a carrier (e.g., a simple synthetic scaffold, or a larger carrier protein or polysaccharide, such as BSA,
   transferrin, or dextran).
                Magnetic particles
                The magnetic particles described herein include those described, e.g., in U.S. Patent No.
20 7,564,245 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003-0092029, each of which is incorporated
   herein by reference. The magnetic particles are generally in the form of conjugates, that is, a
   magnetic particle with one or more binding moieties (e.g., an oligonucleotide, nucleic acid,
   polypeptide, or polysaccharide) linked thereto. The binding moiety causes a specific interaction with
   a target analyte. The binding moiety specifically binds to a selected target analyte, for example, a
25 nucleic acid, polypeptide, or polysaccharide. In some instances, binding causes aggregation of the
   conjugates, resulting in a change, e.g., a decrease (e.g., in the case of smaller magnetic particles) or an
   increase (e.g., in the case of larger magnetic particles) in the spin-spin relaxation time (T2) of adjacent
   water protons in an aqueous solution (or protons in a non-aqueous solvent). Alternatively, the analyte
   binds to a preformed aggregate in a competitive disaggregation assay (e.g., an aggregate formed from
30 a multivalent binding agent and magnetic particles), or competes with a multivalent binding agent for
   binding moieties on the magnetic particles in an inhibition assay (i.e., the formation of aggregates is
   inhibited in the presence of the analyte).
                The conjugates have high relaxivity owing to the superparamagnetism of their iron, metal
   oxide, or other ferro or ferrimagnetic nanomaterials. Iron, cobalt, and nickel compounds and their
35 alloys, rare earth elements such as gadolinium, and certain intermetallics such as gold and vanadium
   are ferromagnets can be used to produce superparamagnetic particles. The magnetic particles can be
                                                       - 56

   monodisperse (a single crystal of a magnetic material, e.g., metal oxide, such as superparamagnetic
   iron oxide, per magnetic particle) or polydisperse (e.g., a plurality of crystals per magnetic particle).
   The magnetic metal oxide can also include cobalt, magnesium, zinc, or mixtures of these metals with
   iron. Important features and elements of magnetic particles that are useful to produce conjugates
 5 include: (i) a high relaxivity, i.e., strong effect on water (or other solvent) relaxation, (ii) a functional
   group to which the binding moiety can be covalently attached, (iii) a low non-specific binding of
   interactive moieties to the magnetic particle, and/or (iv) stability in solution, i.e., the magnetic
   particles remain suspended in solution, not precipitated and/or the nps retain their ability to be
   employed in the described method (i.e. the nps have a shelf life).
10              The magnetic particles may be linked to the binding moieties via functional groups. In some
   embodiments, the magnetic particles can be associated with a polymer that includes functional groups
   selected, in part, to enhance the magnetic particles nonspecific reversibility. The polymer can be a
   synthetic polymer, such as, but not limited to, polyethylene glycol or silane, natural polymers, or
   derivatives of either synthetic or natural polymers or a combination of these. The polymer may be
15 hydrophilic. In some embodiments, the polymer "coating" is not a continuous film around the
   magnetic metal oxide, but is a "mesh" or "cloud" of extended polymer chains attached to and
   surrounding the metal oxide. The polymer can include polysaccharides and derivatives, including
   dextran, pullanan, carboxydextran, carboxmethyl dextran, and/or reduced carboxymethyl dextran.
   The metal oxide can be a collection of one or more crystals that contact each other, or that are
20 individually entrapped or surrounded by the polymer.
                Alternatively, the magnetic particles can be associated with non-polymeric functional group
   compositions. Methods of synthesizing stabilized, functionalized magnetic particles without
   associated polymers are described, for example, in Halbreich et al., Biochimie, 80:379 (1998).
                The magnetic particles typically include metal oxide mono and polycrystals of about 1-25 nm,
25 e.g., about 3-10 nm, or about 5 nm in diameter per crystal. The magnetic particles can also include a
   polymer component in the form of a core and/or coating, e.g., about 5 to 20 nm thick or more. The
   overall size of the magnetic particles can be, e.g., from 20 to 50 nm, from 50 to 200 nm, from 100 to
   300 nm, from 250 to 500 nm, from 400 to 600 nm, from 500 to 750 nm, from 700 to 1,200 nm, from
    1,000 to 1,500 nm, or from 1,500 to 2,000 nm.
30              The magnetic particles may be prepared in a variety of ways. It is preferred that the magnetic
   particle have functional groups that link the magnetic particle to the binding moiety. Carboxy
   functionalized magnetic particles can be made, for example, according to the method of Gorman (see
   PCT Publication No. WOOO/61191). In this method, reduced carboxymethyl (CM) dextran is
   synthesized from commercial dextran. The CM-dextran and iron salts are mixed together and are
35 then neutralized with ammonium hydroxide. The resulting carboxy functionalized magnetic particles
   can be used for coupling amino functionalized oligonucleotides. Carboxy-functionalized magnetic
                                                         - 57

   particles can also be made from polysaccharide coated magnetic particles by reaction with bromo or
   chloroacetic acid in strong base to attach carboxyl groups. In addition, carboxy-functionalized
   particles can be made from amino-functionalized magnetic particles by converting amino to carboxy
   groups by the use of reagents such as succinic anhydride or maleic anhydride.
 5              Magnetic particle size can be controlled by adjusting reaction conditions, for example, by
   using low temperature during the neutralization of iron salts with a base as described in U.S. Patent
   No. 5,262,176. Uniform particle size materials can also be made by fractionating the particles using
   centrifugation, ultrafiltration, or gel filtration, as described, for example in U.S. Patent No. 5,492,814.
                Magnetic particles can also be synthesized according to the method of Molday (Molday, R. S.
10 and D. MacKenzie, "Immunospecific ferromagnetic iron-dextran reagents for the labeling and
   magnetic separation of cells," J. Immunol. Methods, 52:353 (1982)), and treated with periodate to
   form aldehyde groups. The aldehyde-containing magnetic particles can then be reacted with a
   diamine (e.g., ethylene diamine or hexanediamine), which will form a Schiff base, followed by
   reduction with sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride.
15              Dextran-coated magnetic particles can be made and cross-linked with epichlorohydrin. The
   addition of ammonia reacts with epoxy groups to generate amine groups, see Hogemann, D., et al.,
   Improvement of MRI probes to allow efficient detection of gene expression Bioconjug. Chem.,
    11:941 (2000), and Josephson et al., "High-efficiency intracellular magnetic labeling with novel
   superparamagnetic-Tat peptide conjugates," Bioconjug. Chem., 10:186 (1999). This material is
20 known as cross-linked iron oxide or "CLIO" and when functionalized with amine is referred to as
   amine-CLIO or NH 2-CLIO. Carboxy-functionalized magnetic particles can be converted to amino
   functionalized magnetic particles by the use of water-soluble carbodiimides and diamines such as
   ethylene diamine or hexane diamine.
                The magnetic particles can be formed from a ferrofluid (i.e., a stable colloidal suspension of
25 magnetic particles). For example, the magnetic particle can be a composite of including multiple
   metal oxide crystals of the order of a few tens of nanometers in size and dispersed in a fluid
   containing a surfactant, which adsorbs onto the particles and stabilizes them, or by precipitation, in a
   basic medium, of a solution of metal ions. Suitable ferrofluids are sold by the company Liquids
   Research Ltd. under the references: WHKS 1S9 (A, B or C), which is a water-based ferrofluid
30 including magnetite (Fe 30 4), having particles 10 nm in diameter; WHJSI (A, B or C), which is an
   isoparaffin-based ferrofluid including particles of magnetite (Fe 3 0 4 ) 10 nm in diameter; and BKS25
   dextran, which is a water-based ferrofluid stabilized with dextran, including particles of magnetite
   (Fe 3 0 4 ) 9 nm in diameter. Other suitable ferrofluids for use in the systems and methods of the
   invention are oleic acid-stabilized ferrofluids available from Ademtech, which include ca. 70%
35 weight u.-Fe2O3 particles (ca. 10 nm in diameter), 15% weight octane, and 15% weight oleic acid.

                The magnetic particles are typically a composite including multiple metal oxide crystals and
   an organic matrix, and having a surface decorated with functional groups (i.e., amine groups or
   carboxy groups) for the linking binding moieties to the surface of the magnetic particle. For example,
   the magnetic particles useful in the methods of the invention include those commercially available
 5 from Dynal, Seradyn, Kisker, Miltenyi Biotec, Chemicell, Anvil, Biopal, Estapor, Genovis, Thermo
   Fisher Scientific, JSR micro, Invitrogen, and Ademtech, as well as those described in U.S. Patent
   Nos. 4,101,435; 4,452,773; 5,204,457; 5,262,176; 5,424,419; 6,165,378; 6,866,838; 7,001,589; and
   7,217,457, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                Avidin or streptavidin can be attached to magnetic particles for use with a biotinylated
10 binding moiety, such as an oligonucleotide or polypeptide (see, e.g., Shen et al., "Magnetically
   labeled secretin retains receptor affinity to pancreas acinar cells," Bioconjug. Chem., 7:311 (1996)).
   Similarly, biotin can be attached to a magnetic particle for use with an avidin-labeled binding moiety.
   Alternatively, the binding moiety is covalently linked to the surface of the magnetic particle; the
   particles may be decorated with IgG molecules; the particles may be decorated with anti his
15 antibodies; or the particles may be decorated with his-tagged FAbs.
                Low molecular weight materials can be separated from the magnetic particles by ultra
   filtration, dialysis, magnetic separation, or other means prior to use. For example, unreacted binding
   moieties and linking agents can be separated from the magnetic particle conjugates by magnetic
   separation or size exclusion chromatography. In certain instances the magnetic particles can be
20 fractionated by size to produce mixtures of particles of a particular size range and average diameter.
                For certain assays requiring high sensitivity, analyte detection using T 2 relaxation assays can
   require selecting a proper particle to enable sufficiently sensitive analyte-induced agglomeration.
   Higher sensitivities can be achieved using particles that contain multiple superparamagnetic iron
   oxide cores (5-15 nm diameter) within a single larger polymer matrix or ferrofluid assembly (100 nm
25  1200 nm total diameter, such as particles having an average diameter of 100 nm, 200 nm, 250 nm,
   300 nm, 500 nm, 800 nm, or 1000 nm), or by using a higher magnetic moment materials or particles
   with higher density, and/or particles with higher iron content. Without being limited by theory, it is
   postulated these types of particles provided a sensitivity gain of over 100x due to a much higher
   number of iron atoms per particle, which is believed to lead to an increase in sensitivity due to the
30 decreased number of particles present in the assay solution and possibly a higher amount of
   superparamagnetic iron affected by each clustering event.
                Relaxivity per particle and particle size is one useful term for selecting an optimal particle for
   high sensitivity assays. Ideally, this term will be as large as possible. Relaxivity per particle is a
   measure of the effect of each particle on the measured T 2 value. The larger this number, the fewer the
35 number of particles needed to elicit a given T 2 response. Furthermore, lowering the concentration of
   particles in the reactive solution can improve the analytical sensitivity of the assay. Relaxivity per
                                                          - 59
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

  particle can be a more useful parameter in that the iron density and relaxivity can vary from magnetic
  particle to magnetic particle, depending upon the components used to make the particles (see Table
  1). Relaxivity per particle is proportional to the saturation magnetization of a superparamagnetic
  material.

                 The magnetic particles for use in the systems and methods of the invention can have a
   hydrodynamic diameter from 10 nm to 1200 nm, and containing on average from 8x 102 - 1x 1010
   metal atoms per particle, and having a relaxivity per particle of from I x 104 -      Ix  103 mM-s"-.    The
 5 magnetic particles used in the systems and methods of the invention can be any of the designs,
   composites, or sources described above, and can be further modified has described herein for use as a
   magnetic resonance switch.
                In addition to relaxivity per particle, several other practical issues must be address in the
   selection and design of magnetic particles for high analytical sensitivity assays.
10              For example, the use of large particles (i.e., 1000 nm or greater) may be desired to maximize
   iron content and the relaxivity per particle. However, we have observed that particles of this size tend
   to settle rapidly out of solution. We have observed that particle settling does not typically interfere
   with the assay if magnetic particle sizes are kept below 500 nm. When use of a particle above 500 nm
                                                              - 62

   in the described assays or smaller particles with high density are employed, settling is monitored and
   effect on T2 measurement is determined. We have found a magnetic particle size of about 100-300
   nm particle to be ideal for stability in terms of settling, even after functionalization (increasing the
   hydrodynamic diameter to 300 nm by approximately 50 nm), and to afford the high sensitivity
 5 enabled by a high relaxivity per particle. Particle density certainly plays a role in buoyancy. As such,
   the relative density of the solution and particles plays an important role in settling of the particle.
   Accordingly, a possible solution to this problem is the use of buoyant magnetic particles (i.e., a
   hollow particle, or particle containing both a low density matrix and high density metal oxide).
   Settling may affect the T2 detection, thus, solution additives may be employed to change the ratio of
10 the particle to solution density. T2 detection can be impacted by settling if there is a significant
   portioning of the superparamagentic material from the measured volume of liquid. Settling can be
   assessed by diluting the particles to a concentration such that UV-Vis absorbance at 410 nm is
   between 0.6-0.8 absorbance units and then monitoring the absorbance for 90 minutes. If settling
   occurs, the difference between the initial and final absorbances divided by the initial absorbance will
15 be greater than 5%. If % settling is above 5% then the particle is typically not suitable for use in
   assays requiring high analytical sensitivity. The magnetic particles used in the assays of the invention
   can be, but are not limited to, nonsettling magnetic particles. High settling represents handling
   difficulties and may lead to reproducibility issues.
                For magnetic particles on the order of 100 nm or larger, the multiple superparamagnetic iron
20 oxide crystals that typically include the particle core results in a net dipole moment when in the
   presence of external magnetic fields, i.e. the dipole monment is a sufficient force to overcome
   Brownian motion. Nonspecific reversibility is a measure of the colloidal stability and robustness
   against non-specific aggregation. Nonspecific reversibility is assessed by measuring the T2 values of
   a solution of particles before and after incubation in a uniform magnetic field (defined as <5000 ppm).
25 Starting T2 values are typically 200 ms for a particle with an iron concentration of 0.01mM Fe. If the
   difference in T2 values before and after incubation in the uniform magnetic field is less than 20 ms,
   the samples are deemed reversible. Further, 10% is a threshold allowing starting T2 measurements to
   reflect assay particle concentration. If the difference is greater than 10%, then the particles exhibit
   irreversibility in the buffer, diluents, and matrix tested. The MAA reversibility of the magnetic
30 particles can be altered as described herein. For example, colloidal stability and robustness against
   non-specific aggregation can be influenced by the surface characteristics of the particles, the binding
   moieties, the assay buffer, the matrix and the assay processing conditions. Maintenance of colloidal
   stability and resistance to non-specific biding can be altered by conjugation chemistry, blocking
   methods, buffer modifications, and/or changes in assay processing conditions.
35              We have observed that a very important attribute for robust and reproducible assays is the
   monodispersity in the size distribution of the magnetic particles used, a distinction observed in
                                                        - 63

   polydisperse particles post-coating versus monodisperse particle pre-coating. Polydisperse batches of
   magnetic particles can lack reproducibility and compromise sensitivity. Polydisperse samples can
   also present problems in terms of achieving uniform coatings. For certain highly sensitive assays it is
   desirable that the magnetic particles be substantially monodisperse in size distribution (i.e., having a
 5 polydispersity index of less than about 0.8 - 0.9). Alternatively, the assays of the invention can be
   designed to accommodate the use of polydisperse magnetic particles.
                Given that the assays of the invention require monitoring a shift in the clustering states of the
   agglomeration assays and that measuring a change in clustering likely requires a significant fraction
   of clustered particles (e.g., thought to be >I-10%), the total number of particles in an assay should be
10 minimized to enable the highest sensitivity. However, sufficient number of particles must be present
   to allow utilization of the T2 detection dynamic range. We have found that the highest sensitivity is
   observed when the number of magnetic particles (or molar equivalent) is approximately on the same
   order of magnitude of the number (or molar equivalent) of the analyte being detected, and the
   magnitude of the number (or molar equivalent) multivalent binding agents employed (i.e., in an
15 inhibition assay).
                For proteinaceous samples it may also be required to modify the magnetic particle surface to
   reduce non-specific binding of background proteins to the magnetic particles. Non-specific binding
   of background proteins to particles can induce or impede particle clustering, resulting in false signals
   and/or false lack of signals. For example, in some instances the surface of the magnetic particle can
20 include blocking agents covalently linked to the surface of the magnetic particle which reduce non
   specific binding of background proteins. There are a variety of agents that one could use to achieve
   the desired effect, and in some cases, it is a combination of agents that is optimal (see Table 3;
   exemplary particles, coatings, and binding moieties).

                Thus, we have found a protein block may be required to achieve assay activity and sensitivity,
   particularly in proteinaceous samples (e.g., plasma samples or whole blood samples), that is
 5 comparable to results in nonproteinaceous buffer samples. Some commonly used protein blockers
   which may be used in provided preparations include, e.g., bovine serum albumin (BSA), fish skin
   gelatin (FSG), bovine gamma globulin (BGG), lysozyme, casein, peptidase, or non-fat dry milk. In
   certain embodiments a magnetic particle coating includes BSA or FSG. In other embodiments, a
   combination of coatings are combinations of those exemplary coatings listed in Table 3.
10              Furthermore, nonspecific binding can be due to lipids or other non-proteinaceous molecules
   in the biological sample. For non-proteinaceous mediated non-specific binding, changes in pH and
   buffer ionic strength maybe selected to enhance the particle repulsive forces, but not enough to limit
   the results of the intended interactions.

   ether compounds and are available in various molecular weight designations, for example, IGEPAL
10 CA720, IGEPAL CA630, and IGEPAL CA890. Other suitable non-ionic surfactants include those
   available under the trade name TETRONIC 909 from BASF Wyandotte Corporation. This material is
   a tetra-functional block copolymer surfactant terminating in primary hydroxyl groups. Suitable non
   ionic surfactants are also available under the VISTA ALPHONIC trade name from Vista Chemical
   Company and such materials are ethoxylates that are non-ionic biodegradables derived from linear
15 primary alcohol blends of various molecular weights. The surfactant may also be selected from
   poloxamers, such as polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymers, such as those available
   under the trade names Synperonic PE series (ICI), Pluronic series (BASF), Supronic, Monolan,
   Pluracare, and Plurodac, polysorbate surfactants, such as Tween@ 20 (PEG-20 sorbitan monolaurate),
   and glycols such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol.
20              Such non-ionic surfactants may be selected to provide an appropriate amount of detergency
   for an assay without having a deleterious effect on assay reactions. In particular, surfactants may be
   included in a reaction mixture for the purpose of suppressing non-specific interactions among various
                                                                 - 66

   ingredients of the aggregation assays of the invention. The non-ionic surfactants are typically added
   to the liquid sample prior in an amount from 0.01% (w/w) to 5% (w/w).
                The non-ionic surfactants may be used in combination with one or more proteins (e.g.,
   albumin, fish skin gelatin, lysozyme, or transferrin) also added to the liquid sample prior in an amount
 5 from 0.01% (w/w) to 5% (w/w).
                Furthermore, the assays, methods, and cartridge units of the invention can include additional
   suitable buffer components (e.g., Tris base, selected to provide a pH of about 7.8 to 8.2 in the reaction
   milieu); and chelating agents to scavenge cations (e.g., EDTA disodium, ethylene diamine tetraacetic
   acid (EDTA), citric acid, tartaric acid, glucuronic acid, saccharic acid or suitable salts thereof).
10
                Binding moieties
                In general, a binding moiety is a molecule, synthetic or natural, that specifically binds or
   otherwise links to, e.g., covalently or non-covalently binds to or hybridizes with, a target molecule, or
   with another binding moiety (or, in certain embodiments, with an aggregation inducing molecule).
15 For example, the binding moiety can be an antibody directed toward an antigen or any protein-protein
   interaction. Alternatively, the binding moiety can be a polysaccharide that binds to a corresponding
   target or a synthetic oligonucleotide that hybridizes to a specific complementary nucleic acid target.
   In certain embodiments, the binding moieties can be designed or selected to serve, when bound to
   another binding moiety, as substrates for a target molecule such as enzyme in solution.
20              Binding moieties include, for example, oligonucleotide binding moieties (DNA, RNA, or
   substituted or derivatized nucleotide substitutes), polypeptide binding moieties, antibody binding
   moieties, aptamers, and polysaccharide binding moieties.
                Oligonucleotide binding moieties
25              In certain embodiments, the binding moieties are oligonucleotides, attached/linked to the
   magnetic particles using any of a variety of chemistries, by a single, e.g., covalent, bond, e.g., at the
   3' or 5' end to a functional group on the magnetic particle. Such binding moieties can be used in the
   systems, devices, and methods of the invention to detect mutations (e.g., SNPs, translocations, large
   deletions, small deletions, insertions, substitutions) or to monitor gene expression (e.g., the presence
30 of expression, or changes in the level of gene expression, monitoring RNA transcription), or CHP
   analysis characteristic of the presence of a pathogen, disease state, or the progression of disease.
                An oligonucleotide binding moiety can be constructed using chemical synthesis. A double
   stranded DNA binding moiety can be constructed by enzymatic ligation reactions using procedures
   known in the art. For example, a nucleic acid (e.g., an oligonucleotide) can be chemically synthesized
35 using naturally occurring nucleotides or variously modified nucleotides designed to increase the
   biological stability of the molecules or to increase the physical stability of the duplex formed between
                                                        - 67
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   the complementary strands, e.g., phosphorothioate derivatives and acridine substituted nucleotides
   can be used. The nucleic acid also can be produced biologically using an expression vector into
   which a nucleic acid has been subcloned.
                One method uses at least two populations of oligonucleotide magnetic particles, each with
 5 strong effects on water (or other solvent) relaxation. As the oligonucleotide-magnetic particle
   conjugates react with a target oligonucleotide, they form aggregates (e.g., clusters of magnetic
   particles). Upon prolonged standing, e.g., overnight at room temperature, the aggregates form large
   clusters (micron-sized clusters). Using the methods of the invention, the formation of large clusters
   can be accomplished more quickly by employing multiple cycles of magnetic assisted agglomeration.
10 Magnetic resonance is used to determine the relaxation properties of the solvent, which are altered
   when the mixture of magnetic oligonucleotide magnetic particles reacts with a target nucleic acid to
   form aggregates.
                Certain embodiments employ a mixture of at least two types of magnetic metal oxide
   magnetic particles, each with a specific sequence of oligonucleotide, and each with more than one
15 copy of the oligonucleotide attached, e.g., covalently, per magnetic particle. For example, the assay
   protocol may involve preparing a mixture of populations of oligonucleotide-magnetic particle
   conjugates and reacting the mixture with a target nucleic acid. Alternatively, oligonucleotide
   magnetic particle conjugates can be reacted with the target in a sequential fashion. Certain
   embodiments feature the use of magnetic resonance to detect the reaction of the oligonucleotide
20 magnetic particle conjugates with the target nucleic acid. When a target is present, the dispersed
   conjugates self-assemble to form small aggregates.
                For example, oligonucleotide binding moieties can be linked to the metal oxide through
   covalent attachment to a functionalized polymer or to non-polymeric surface-functionalized metal
   oxides. In the latter method, the magnetic particles can be synthesized according to the method of
25 Albrecht et al., Biochimie, 80:379 (1998). Dimercapto-succinic acid is coupled to the iron oxide and
   provides a carboxyl functional group.
                In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are attached to magnetic particles via a
   functionalized polymer associated with the metal oxide. In some embodiments, the polymer is
   hydrophilic. In certain embodiments, the conjugates are made using oligonucleotides that have
30 terminal amino, sulfhydryl, or phosphate groups, and superparamagnetic iron oxide magnetic particles
   bearing amino or carboxy groups on a hydrophilic polymer. There are several methods for
   synthesizing carboxy and amino derivatized-magnetic particles.
                In one embodiment, oligonucleotides are attached to a particle via ligand-protein binding
   interaction, such as biotin-streptavidin, where the ligand is covalently attached to the oligonucleotide
35 and the protein to the particle, or vice versa. This approach can allow for more rapid reagent
   preparation.
                                                       - 68
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

                Other forms of oligonucleotides may be used. For example, aptamers are single-stranded
   RNA or DNA oligonucleotides 15 to 60 base in length that in solution form intramolecular
   interactions that fold the linear nucleic acid molecule into a three dimensional complex that then can
   bind with high affinity to specific molecular targets; often with equilibrium constants in the range of 1
 5 pM to 1 nM which is similar to some monoclonal antibodies-antigen interactions. Aptamers can
   specifically bind to other nucleic acid molecules, proteins, small organic compounds, small
   molecules, and cells (organisms or pathogens).
10              Polypeptide binding moieties
                In certain embodiments, the binding moiety is a polypeptide (i.e., a protein, polypeptide, or
   peptide), attached, using any of a variety of chemistries, by a single covalent bond in such a manner
   so as to not affect the biological activity of the polypeptide. In one embodiment, attachment is done
   through the thiol group of single reactive cysteine residue so placed that its modification does not
15 affect the biological activity of the polypeptide. In this regard the use of linear polypeptides, with
   cysteine at the C-terminal or N-terminal end, provides a single thiol in a manner similar to which
   alkanethiol supplies a thiol group at the 3' or 5' end of an oligonucleotide. Similar bifunctional
   conjugation reagents, such as SPDP and reacting with the amino group of the magnetic particle and
   thiol group of the polypeptide, can be used with any thiol bearing binding moiety. The types of
20 polypeptides used as binding moieties can be antibodies, antibody fragments, and natural and
   synthetic polypeptide sequences. The peptide binding moieties have a binding partner, that is, a
   molecule to which they selectively bind.
                Use of peptides as binding moieties offers several advantages. For example, polypeptides can
   be engineered to have uniquely reactive residues, distal from the residues required for biological
25 activity, for attachment to the magnetic particle. The reactive residue can be a cysteine thiol, an N
   terminal amino group, a C-terminal carboxyl group or a carboxyl group of aspartate or glutamate, etc.
   A single reactive residue on the peptide is used to insure a unique site of attachment. These design
   principles can be followed with chemically synthesized peptides or biologically produced
   polypeptides.
30              The binding moieties can also contain amino acid sequences from naturally occurring (wild
   type) polypeptides or proteins. For example, the natural polypeptide may be a hormone, (e.g., a
   cytokine, a growth factor), a serum protein, a viral protein (e.g., hemagglutinin), an extracellular
   matrix protein, a lectin, or an ectodomain of a cell surface protein. Another example is a ligand
   binding protein, such as streptavidin or avidin that bind biotin. In general, the resulting binding
35 moiety-magnetic particle is used to measure the presence of analytes in a test media reacting with the
   binding moiety.
                                                        - 69
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

                Additionally, a polypeptide binding moiety can be used in a universal reagent configuration,
   where the target of the binding moiety (e.g., small molecule, ligand, or binding partner) is pre
   attached to the target analyte to create a labeled analyte that, in the presence of the polypeptide
   decorated particles, induces clustering.
 5              Examples of protein hormones which can be utilized as binding moieties include, without
   limitation, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which binds the PDGF receptor; insulin-like
   growth factor-I and -11 (Igf) ,which binds the Igf receptor; nerve growth factor (NGF), which binds
   the NGF receptor; fibroblast growth factor (FGF), which binds the FGF receptor (e.g., aFGF and
   bFGF); epidermal growth factor (EGF), which binds the EGF receptor; transforming growth factor
10 (TGF, e.g., TGFa. and TGF-p), which bind the TGF receptor; erythropoietin, which binds the
   erythropoitin receptor; growth hormone (e.g., human growth hormone), which binds the growth
   hormone receptor; and proinsulin, insulin, A-chain insulin, and B-chain insulin, which all bind to the
   insulin receptor.
                Receptor binding moieties are useful for detecting and imaging receptor clustering on the
15 surface of a cell. Useful ectodomains include those of the Notch protein, Delta protein, integrins,
   cadherins, and other cell adhesion molecules.
                Antibody binding moieties
                Other polypeptide binding moieties include immunoglobulin binding moieties that include at
20 least one immunoglobulin domain, and typically at least two such domains. An "immunoglobulin
   domain" refers to a domain of an antibody molecule, e.g., a variable or constant domain. An
   "immunoglobulin superfamily domain" refers to a domain that has a three-dimensional structure
   related to an immunoglobulin domain, but is from a non-immunoglobulin molecule. Immunoglobulin
   domains and immunoglobulin superfamily domains typically include two            P -sheets formed of about
25 seven     P -strands, and a conserved  disulfide bond (see, e.g., Williams and Barclay Ann. Rev Immunol.,
   6:381 (1988)). Proteins that include domains of the Ig superfamily domains include T cell receptors,
   CD4, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM).
                One type of immunoglobulin binding moiety is an antibody. The term "antibody," as used
   herein, refers to a full-length, two-chain immunoglobulin molecule and an antigen-binding portion
30 and fragments thereof, including synthetic variants. A typical antibody includes two heavy (H) chain
   variable regions (abbreviated herein as VH), and two light (L) chain variable regions (abbreviated
   herein as VL). The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability,
   termed "complementarity determining regions" (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more
   conserved, termed "framework regions" (FR). The extent of the framework region and CDR's has
35 been precisely defined (see, Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological
   Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91
                                                        - 70
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   3242, and Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol., 196:901 (1987)). Each VH and VL is composed of three
   CDR's and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FRI,
   CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4.
                An antibody can also include a constant region as part of a light or heavy chain. Light chains
 5 can include a kappa or lambda constant region gene at the COOH-terminus (termed CL). Heavy
   chains can include, for example, a gamma constant region (IgGI, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4; encoding about
   330 amino acids). A gamma constant region can include, e.g., CHI, CH2, and CH3. The term "full
   length antibody" refers to a protein that includes one polypeptide that includes VL and CL, and a
   second polypeptide that includes VH, CHI, CH2, and CH3.
10              The term "antigen-binding fragment" of an antibody, as used herein, refers to one or more
   fragments of a full-length antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to a target. Examples of
   antigen-binding fragments include, but are not limited to: (i) an Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment
   consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CHI domains; (ii) an F(ab') 2 fragment, a bivalent fragment
   including two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) an Fd fragment
15 consisting of the VH and CHI domains; (iv) an Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of
   a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., Nature 341:544 (1989)), which consists
   of a VH domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). Furthermore,
   although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can
   be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single
20 protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single
   chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al., Science 242:423 (1988); and Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
   USA, 85:5879 (1988)).              Such single chain antibodies are also encompassed within the term "antigen
   binding fragment."
                A single domain antibody (sdAb, nanobody) is an antibody fragment consisting of a single
25 monomeric variable antibody domain, and may also be used in the systems and methods of the
   invention. Like a whole antibody, sdAbs are able to bind selectively to a specific antigen. With a
   molecular weight of only 12-15 kDa, single domain antibodies are much smaller than common
   antibodies (150-160 kDa) which are composed of two heavy protein chains and two light chains, and
   even smaller than Fab fragments (-50 kDa, one light chain and half a heavy chain) and single-chain
30 variable fragments (-25 kDa, two variable domains, one from a light and one from a heavy chain).
                Polysaccharide binding moieties
                In certain embodiments, the binding moiety is a polysaccharide, linked, for example, using
   any of a variety of chemistries, by a single bond, e.g., a covalent bond, at one of the two ends, to a
35 functional group on the magnetic particle. The polysaccharides can be synthetic or natural. Mono-,
   di-, tri- and polysaccharides can be used as the binding moiety. These include, e.g., glycosides, N
                                                              - 71
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   glycosylamines, 0-acyl derivatives, 0-methyl derivatives, osazones, sugar alcohols, sugar acids,
   sugar phosphates when used with appropriate attachment chemistry to the magnetic particle.
                A method of accomplishing linking is to couple avidin to a magnetic particle and react the
   avidin-magnetic particle with commercially available biotinylated polysaccharides, to yield
 5 polysaccharide-magnetic particle conjugates. For example, sialyl Lewis based polysaccharides are
   commercially available as biotinylated reagents and will react with avidin-CLIO (see Syntesome,
   Gesellschaft fur medizinische Biochemie mbH.). The sialyl Lewis x tetrasaccharide (Slex) is
   recognized by proteins known as Selectins, which are present on the surfaces of leukocytes and
   function as part of the inflammatory cascade for the recruitment of leukocytes.
10              Still other targeting moieties include a non-proteinaceous element, e.g., a glycosyl
   modification (such as a Lewis antigen) or another non-proteinaceous organic molecule. Another
   method is covalent coupling of the protein to the magnetic particle.
                Another feature of the methods includes identification of specific cell types, for
   hematological or histopatholgical investigations for example CD4/CD3 cell counts and circulating
15 tumor cells using any of the binding moieties described above.
                Multivalent binding agents
                The assays of the invention can include a multivalent binding agent (i) bearing multiple
   analytes are linked to a carrier (e.g., a simple synthetic scaffold, or a larger carrier protein or
20 polysaccharide, such as BSA, transferrin, or dextran), or bearing multiple epitopes for binding to, for
   example, two or more populations of magnetic particles to form an aggregate.
                Where a multivalent binding agent is employed, multiple analytes can be linked to a carrier
   (e.g., a simple synthetic scaffold, or a larger carrier protein or polysaccharide, such as BSA,
   transferrin, or dextran). Alternatively, the multivalent binding agent can be a nucleic acid designed to
25 bind to two or more populations of magnetic particles. Such multivalent binding agents act as
   agglomerants and the assay architecture is characterized by a competition between the analyte being
   detected and the multivalent binding agent (e.g., in an inhibition assay, competition assay, or
   disaggregation assay).
                The functional group present in the analyte can be used to form a covalent bond with the
30 carrier. Alternatively, the analyte can be derivatized to provide a linker (i.e., a spacer separating the
   analyte from the carrier in the conjugate) terminating in a functional group (i.e., an alcohol, an amine,
   a carboxyl group, a sulfhydryl group, or a phosphate group), which is used to form the covalent
   linkage with the carrier.
                The covalent linking of an analyte and a carrier may be effected using a linker which contains
35 reactive moieties capable of reaction with such functional groups present in the analyte and the
                                                          - 72
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   carrier. For example, a hydroxyl group of the analyte may react with a carboxyl group of the linker,
   or an activated derivative thereof, resulting in the formation of an ester linking the two.
                Examples of moieties capable of reaction with sulfhydryl groups include a-haloacetyl
   compounds of the type XCH 2 CO- (where X=Br, Cl or I), which show particular reactivity for
 5 sulfhydryl groups, but which can also be used to modify imidazolyl, thioether, phenol, and amino
   groups as described by Gurd, Methods Enzymol. 11:532 (1967). N-Maleimide derivatives are also
   considered selective towards sulfhydryl groups, but may additionally be useful in coupling to amino
   groups under certain conditions. Reagents such as 2-iminothiolane (Traut et al., Biochemistry
    12:3266 (1973)), which introduce a thiol group through conversion of an amino group, may be
10 considered as sulfhydryl reagents if linking occurs through the formation of disulphide bridges.
                Examples of reactive moieties capable of reaction with amino groups include, for example,
   alkylating and acylating agents. Representative alkylating agents include:
   (i) a-haloacetyl compounds, which show specificity towards amino groups in the absence of reactive
   thiol groups and are of the type XCH 2 CO- (where X=Cl, Br or I), for example, as described by Wong,
15 Biochemistry 24:5337 (1979); (ii) N-maleimide derivatives, which may react with amino groups
   either through a Michael type reaction or through acylation by addition to the ring carbonyl group, for
   example, as described by Smyth et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 82:4600 (1960) and Biochem. J. 91:589
   (1964); (iii) aryl halides such as reactive nitrohaloaromatic compounds; (iv) alkyl halides, as
   described, for example, by McKenzie et al., J. Protein Chem. 7:581 (1988); (v) aldehydes and ketones
20 capable of Schiff's base formation with amino groups, the adducts formed usually being stabilized
   through reduction to give a stable amine; (vi) epoxide derivatives such as epichlorohydrin and
   bisoxiranes, which may react with amino, sulfhydryl, or phenolic hydroxyl groups; (vii) chlorine
   containing derivatives of s-triazines, which are very reactive towards nucleophiles such as amino,
   sufhydryl, and hydroxyl groups; (viii) aziridines based on s-triazine compounds detailed above, e.g.,
25 as described by Ross, J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2:1 (1954), which react with nucleophiles such as amino
   groups by ring opening; (ix) squaric acid diethyl esters as described by Tietze, Chem. Ber. 124:1215
   (1991); and (x) a-haloalkyl ethers, which are more reactive alkylating agents than normal alkyl
   halides because of the activation caused by the ether oxygen atom, as described by Benneche et al.,
   Eur. J. Med. Chem. 28:463 (1993).
30              Representative amino-reactive acylating agents include: (i) isocyanates and isothiocyanates,
   particularly aromatic derivatives, which form stable urea and thiourea derivatives respectively; (ii)
   sulfonyl chlorides, which have been described by Herzig et al., Biopolymers 2:349 (1964); (iii) acid
   halides; (iv) active esters such as nitrophenylesters or N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters; (v) acid
   anhydrides such as mixed, symmetrical, or N-carboxyanhydrides; (vi) other useful reagents for amide
35 bond formation, for example, as described by M. Bodansky, Principles of Peptide Synthesis,
   Springer-Verlag, 1984; (vii) acylazides, e.g. wherein the azide group is generated from a preformed
                                                       - 73
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   hydrazide derivative using sodium nitrite, as described by Wetz et al., Anal. Biochem. 58:347 (1974);
   and (viii) imidoesters, which form stable amidines on reaction with amino groups, for example, as
   described by Hunter and Ludwig, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 84:3491 (1962). Aldehydes and ketones may be
   reacted with amines to form Schiff's bases, which may advantageously be stabilized through
 5 reductive amination. Alkoxylamino moieties readily react with ketones and aldehydes to produce
   stable alkoxamines, for example, as described by Webb et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 1:96 (1990).
                Examples of reactive moieties capable of reaction with carboxyl groups include diazo
   compounds such as diazoacetate esters and diazoacetamides, which react with high specificity to
   generate ester groups, for example, as described by Herriot, Adv. Protein Chem. 3:169 (1947).
10 Carboxyl modifying reagents such as carbodiimides, which react through O-acylurea formation
   followed by amide bond formation, may also be employed.
                It will be appreciated that functional groups in the analyte and/or the carrier may, if desired,
   be converted to other functional groups prior to reaction, for example, to confer additional reactivity
   or selectivity. Examples of methods useful for this purpose include conversion of amines to
15 carboxyls using reagents such as dicarboxylic anhydrides; conversion of amines to thiols using
   reagents such as N-acetylhomocysteine thiolactone, S-acetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride, 2
   iminothiolane, or thiol-containing succinimidyl derivatives; conversion of thiols to carboxyls using

                So-called zero-length linkers, involving direct covalentjoining of a reactive chemical group
   of the analyte with a reactive chemical group of the carrier without introducing additional linking
   material may, if desired, be used in accordance with the invention. Most commonly, however, the
25 linker will include two or more reactive moieties, as described above, connected by a spacer element.
   The presence of such a spacer permits bifunctional linkers to react with specific functional groups
   within the analyte and the carrier, resulting in a covalent linkage between the two. The reactive
   moieties in a linker may be the same (homobifunctional linker) or different (heterobifunctional linker,
   or, where several dissimilar reactive moieties are present, heteromultifunctional linker), providing a
30 diversity of potential reagents that may bring about covalent attachment between the analyte and the
   carrier.
                Spacer elements in the linker typically consist of linear or branched chains and may include a
   C 1.1o alkyl, a heteroalkyl of I to 10 atoms, a C 2 -1 o alkene, a C 2 -io alkyne, C5 .io aryl, a cyclic system of 3
   to 10 atoms, or -(CH 2CH 20).CH 2CH 2-, in which n is I to 4.
35              Typically, a multivalent binding agent will include 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 50, or 100 (e.g., from
   3 to 100, from 3 to 30, from 4 to 25, or from 6 to 20) conjugated analytes. The multivalent binding

10              Other analytes which can be detected using the devices, systems, and methods of the
   invention include those mentioned in the Tietz Textbook of Clinical Chemistry and Molecular
   Diagnostics, Burtis, Ashwood, and Bruns, ISBN 0721601898, Elsevier, 4" edition (2006).
                The methods, kits, cartridges, and systems of the invention can be configured to detect a
   predetermined combination panel of analytes that may be used to understand the medical condition of
15 the subject. For example, a combination panel may include detection of pathogens, therapaeutic
   agents used to treat the suspected pathogens, and a potential biomarker to monitor the therapeutic
   pharmacologic progress (efficacy or pharmacokinetic), or monitoring the presence of the pathogen or
   pathogen by-products. Further, one could envision a disease treatment panel configured for use to
   detect a disease or a disease biomarker, the level or concentration of a therapeutic drug for use in
20 treating the suspected disease, a potential biomarker to monitor the therapeutic pharmacologic
   progress (efficacy or pharmacokinetic), and general chemistry biomarker or other physiological
   marker of the disease or effect of treatment. In this way, panels of analyte detection can be used to
   inform and lead to appropriate medical decision making.
                For example, the systems and methods of the invention can be used to monitor immuno
25 compromised subjects following allogenic transplantation. In transplant subjects that receive solid
   organ, bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cell, or other allogeneic donations, there is a need to monitor
   the immune status, organ function, and if necessary, rapidly and accurately identify opportunistic
   infections. Tacrolimus (also FK-506, Prograf, or Fujimycin) is an immunosuppressive drug whose
   main use is after allogeneic organ transplant to reduce the activity of the subject's immune system and
30 so lower the risk of organ rejection. It reduces interleukin-2 (IL-2) production by T-cells. It is also
   used in a topical preparation in the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis (eczema), severe refractory
   uveitis after bone marrow transplants, and the skin condition vitiligo. It is a 23-membered macrolide
   lactone discovered in 1984 from the fermentation broth of a Japanese soil sample that contained the
   bacteria Streptomyces tsukubaensis. It has similar immunosuppressive properties to cyclosporin, but
35 is much more potent in equal volumes. Immunosuppression with tacrolimus was associated with a
   significantly lower rate of acute rejection compared with cyclosporin-based immunosuppression
                                                        - 90

   (30.7% vs. 46.4%) in one study. Long term outcome has not been improved to the same extent.
   Tacrolimus is normally prescribed as part of a post-transplant cocktail including steroids,
   mycophenolate and IL-2 receptor inhibitors. Dosages are titrated to target blood levels. Side effects
   can be severe and include infection, cardiac damage, hypertension, blurred vision, liver and kidney
 5 problems, seizures, tremors, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesaemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus,
   itching, insonmia, and neurological problems such as confusion, loss of appetite, weakness,
   depression, cramps, and neuropathy. In addition tacrolimus may potentially increase the severity of
   existing fungal or infectious conditions such as herpes zoster or polyoma viral infections, and certain
   antibiotics cross-react with tacrolimus.
10              Measuring serum creatinine is a simple test and it is the most commonly used indicator of
   renal function. A rise in blood creatinine levels is observed only with marked damage to functioning
   nephrons. Therefore, this test is not suitable for detecting early stage kidney disease. A better
   estimation of kidney function is given by the creatinine clearance test. Creatinine clearance can be
   accurately calculated using serum creatinine concentration and some or all of the following variables:
15 sex, age, weight, and race as suggested by the American Diabetes Association without a 24 hour urine
   collection. Some laboratories will calculate the creatinine clearance if written on the pathology
   request form; and, the necessary age, sex, and weight are included in the subject information.
                There is a need to monitor creatinine and tacrolimus levels from the same blood sample from
   a subject as the monitoring of the drug concentration and the renal function can assist and guide the
20 physician to optimal therapy post-transplantation. Optimizing therapy is a tight balance of preventing
   rejection but also to ensure immune function to fight opportunistic infections and overall results in
   enhanced subject compliance to the immunosuppressive therapy. In large part, transplant recipients
   succumb to transplant rejection, graft versus host disease, or opportunistic infections. In the first two,
   immunosuppressive agents can ablate or inhibit the reactions. However, if the subject has an
25 underlying infection, then clinical management is challenging. For a specific example, a heart, lung
   transplant subject presenting with fever of unknown origin enters a health care facility. The subject is
   started on broad spectrum antibiotics until the culture results are known. If the condition worsens,
   and the culture reveals a specific infection, for example candida, a specific antifungal, fluconazole,
   can be administered to the known subject. However, this antifungal may alter the levels of the
30 immunosuppressive agent given to almost all allogenic transplant recipients, tacrolimus. Upon testing
   for both tacrolimus and creatinine levels, the physician halts the tacrolimus, believing that the
   fluconazole will defeat the infection, and in a rapid manner. Under this regimen, the subject may
   worsen if the candida species is resistant to fluconazole, and the subject is then started on an
   appropriate anti-fungal agent. However, since the tacrolimus may be halted, the immunosuppressive
35 therapy is unmanaged and the subject may become unresponsive to any additional therapy and death
   may ensue. Thus, if there was a test to simultaneously monitor creatinine (kidney function),
                                                        - 91

   tacrolimus blood levels, and accurate identification of opportunistic infections, the above subject may
   have been saved.
                The systems and methods of the invention can include a multiplexed, no sample preparation,
   single detection method, automated system to determine the drug level, the toxicity or adverse effect
 5 determinant, and the pathogen identification having a critical role in the immunocompromised subject
   setting. For example, a cartridge having portals or wells containing 1) magnetic particles having
   creatinine specific antibodies decorated on their surface, 2) magnetic particles having tacrolimus
   specific antibodies on their surface, and 3) magnetic particles having specific nucleic acid probes to
   identify pathogen species could be employed to rapidly determine and provide clinical management
10 values for a given transplant subject. Opportunistic infections that can be monitored in such subjects,
   and any other patient populations at risk of infection, include, without limitation, fungal; candida
   (resistant and non-resistant strains); gram negative bacterial infections (e.g., E. coli,
   stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella pneumonia/oxytoca, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa); and
   gram positive bacterial infections (e.g., Staphylococcus species: S. aureus, S. pneumonia, E. faecalis,
15 and E. faecium). Other opportunistic infections that can be monitored include coaglulase negative
   staphylococcus, Corynebacterium spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Morganella morganii, and viral
   organisms, such as CMV, BKV, EBC, HHV-6, HIV, HCV, HBV, and HAV.
                The systems and methods of the invention can also be used to monitor and diagnose cancer
   patients as part of a multiplexed diagnostic test. One specific form of cancer, colorectal cancer, has
20 demonstrated positive promise for personalized medical treatment for a specific solid tumor.
   Pharmacogenetic markers can be used to optimize treatment of colorectal and other cancers.
   Significant individual genetic variation exists in drug metabolism of 5FU, capecitabine, irinotecan,
   and oxaliplatin that influences both the toxicity and efficacy of these agents. Examples of genetic
   markers include UGT1Al*28 leads to reduced conjugation of SN-38, the active metabolite of
25 irinotecan, resulting in an increased rate of adverse effects, especially neutropenia. To a lesser extent,
   increased 5-FU toxicity is predicted by DPYD*2A. A variable number of tandem repeats
   polymorphism in the thymidylate synthase enhancer region, in combination with a single nucleotide
   polymorphism C>G, may predict poorer response to 5-FU. Efficacy of oxaliplatin is influenced by
   polymorphisms in components of DNA repair systems, such as ERCC 1 and XRCC 1. Polymorphic
30 changes in the endothelial growth factor receptor probably predict cetuximab efficacy. Furthermore,
   the antibody-depended cell-mediated cytotoxic effect of cetuximab may be reduced by
   polymorphisms in the immunoglobin G fragment C receptors. Polymorphic changes in the VEGF
   gene and the hypoxia inducible factor alpha gene are also believed to play a role in the variability of
   therapy outcome. Thus, identification of such polymorphisms in subjects can be used to assist
35 physicians with treatment decisions. For example, PCR-based genetics tests have been developed to
   assist physicians with therapeutic treatment decisions for subjects with non-small cell lung cancer
                                                      - 92

   (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer. Expression of ERCC1, TS, EGFR, RRM1,
   VEGFR2, HER2, and detection of mutations in KRAS, EGFR, and BRAF are available for physicians
   to order to identify the optimal therapeutic option. However, these PCR tests are not available on site,
   and thus the sample must be delivered to the off-site laboratory. These solid tumors are often
 5 biopsied and FFPE (Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (tissue)) samples are prepared. The systems
   and methods of the invention can be used without the 5-7 day turnaround to get the data and
   information and use of fixed samples required for existing methods. The systems and methods of the
   invention can provide a single platform to analyze samples, without sample prep, for multiple analyte
   types, as in cancer for chemotherapeutic drugs, genpotyping, toxicity and efficacy markers can
10 revolutionize the practice of personalized medicine and provide rapid, accurate diagnostic testing.
                The systems and methods of the invention can also be used to monitor and diagnose
   neurological disease, such as dementia (a loss of cognitive ability in a previously-unimpaired person)
   and other forms of cognitive impairment. Without careful assessment of history, the short-term
   syndrome of delirium (often lasting days to weeks) can easily be confused with dementia, because
15 they have all symptoms in common, save duration, and the fact that delirium is often associated with
   over-activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Some mental illnesses, including depression and
   psychosis, may also produce symptoms that must be differentiated from both delirium and dementia.
   Routine blood tests are also usually performed to rule out treatable causes. These tests include
   vitamin B12, folic acid, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), C-reactive protein, full blood count,
20 electrolytes, calcium, renal function, and liver enzymes. Abnormalities may suggest vitamin
   deficiency, infection or other problems that commonly cause confusion or disorientation in the
   elderly. The problem is complicated by the fact that these cause confusion more often in persons who
   have early dementia, so that "reversal" of such problems may ultimately only be temporary. Testing
   for alcohol and other known dementia-inducing drugs may be indicated. Acetylcholinesterase
25 inhibitors-Tacrine (Cognex), donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Razadyne), and rivastigmine (Exelon)
   are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of dementia
   induced by Alzheimer disease. They may be useful for other similar diseases causing dementia such
   as Parkinsons or vascular dementia. N-methyl-D-aspartate blockers include memantine (Namenda),
   which is a drug representative of this class. It can be used in combination with acetylcholinesterase
30 inhibitors. Amyloid deposit inhibitors include minocycline and clioquinoline, which are antibiotics
   that may help reduce amyloid deposits in the brains of persons with Alzheimer disease. Depression is
   frequently associated with dementia and generally worsens the degree of cognitive and behavioral
   impairment. Antidepressants effectively treat the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of depression in
   subjects with Alzheimer's disease, but evidence for their use in other forms of dementia is weak.
35 Many subjects with dementia experience anxiety symptoms. Although benzodiazepines like
   diazepam (Valium) have been used for treating anxiety in other situations, they are often avoided
                                                      - 93
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   because they may increase agitation in persons with dementia and are likely to worsen cognitive
   problems or are too sedating. Buspirone (Buspar) is often initially tried for mild-to-moderate anxiety.
   There is little evidence for the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in dementia, whereas there is
   evidence for the effectiveness of antipsychotics (at low doses). Selegiline, a drug used primarily in
 5 the treatment of Parkinson's disease, appears to slow the development of dementia. Selegiline is
   thought to act as an antioxidant, preventing free radical damage. However, it also acts as a stimulant,
   making it difficult to determine whether the delay in onset of dementia symptoms is due to protection
   from free radicals or to the general elevation of brain activity from the stimulant effect. Both typical
   antipsychotics (such as haloperidol) and atypical antipsychotics such as (risperidone) increases the
10 risk of death in dementia-associated psychosis. This means that any use of antipsychotic medication
   for dementia-associated psychosis is off-label and should only be considered after discussing the risks
   and benefits of treatment with these drugs, and after other treatment modalities have failed. In the UK
   around 144,000 dementia sufferers are unnecessarily prescribed antipsychotic drugs, around 2000
   subjects die as a result of taking the drugs each year. Dementia can be broadly categorized into two
15 groups: cortical dementias and subcortical dementias. Cortical dementias include: Alzheimer's
   disease, vascular dementia (also known as multi-infarct dementia), including Binswanger's disease,
   dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), alcohol-induced persisting dementia, Korsakoff's syndrome,
   Wernicke's encephalopathy, frontotemporal lobar degenerations (FTLD), including Pick's disease,
   frontotemporal dementia (or frontal variant FTLD), semantic dementia (or temporal variant FTLD),
20 progressive non-fluent aphasia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, dementia pugilistica, Moyamoya disease,
   thebestia (often mistaken for a cancer), posterior cortical atrophy or Benson's syndrome. Subcortical
   dementias include dementia due to Huntington's disease, dementia due to hypothyroidism, dementia
   due to Parkinson's disease, dementia due to vitamin BI deficiency, dementia due to vitamin B12
   deficiency, dementia due to folate deficiency, dementia due to syphilis, dementia due to subdural
25 hematoma, dementia due to hypercalcaemia, dementia due to hypoglycemia, AIDS dementia
   complex, pseudodementia (a major depressive episode with prominent cognitive symptoms),
   aubstance-induced persisting dementia (related to psychoactive use and formerly absinthism),
   dementia due to multiple etiologies, fementia due to other general medical conditions (i.e., end stage
   renal failure, cardiovascular disease etc.), or dementia not otherwise specified (used in cases where no
30 specific criteria is met). Alzheimer's disease is a common form of dementia. There are three
   companies that a currently offer for research only diagnostic testing of proteins (Satoris), splice
   variants (Exonhit), or protein expression levels (Diagenic) in subjects suffering from dementia, Lewy
   Body disease, or mild cognitive impairment. Since dementia is fundamentally associated with many
   neurodegenerative diseases, the ability to test for these proteins, as biomarkers of the disease, along
35 with drug or drug metabolite levels in a single platform will assist a physician to adjust the dosage,
   alter a regimen, or generally monitor the progression of the disease. These tests are currently run off
                                                      - 94

   site at locations far from the subject and care giver. Thus, to have the ability to monitor the drug
   levels and the biomarker in the same detection system, on-site will provide a huge advantage to this
   debilitating and devastating disease. The method of the invention can be a multiplexed, no sample
   preparation, single detection method, automated system to determine the drug level, the toxicity or
 5 adverse effect determinant, and the potential biomarker of the progression of the disease. For
   example, a cartridge having portals or wells containing 1) magnetic particles having protein
   biomarker specific antibodies decorated on their surface, 2) magnetic particles having specific
   antibodies on their surface, and 3) magnetic particles having nucleic acid specific probes to identify
   protein expression levels could be employed to rapidly determine and provide clinical management
10 values for a given dementia subject.
                The systems and methods of the invention can also be used to monitor and diagnose
   infectious disease in a multiplexed, automated, no sample preparation system. Examples of
   pathogens that may be detected using the devices, systems, and methods of the invention include, e.g.,
   Candida (resistant and non-resistant strains), e.g., C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, and
15 C. parapsilosis; A. fumigatus; E. coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella pneumonia/oxytoca,
   P. aeruginosa; Staphylococcus spp. (e.g., S. aureus or S. pneumonia); E. faecalis, E. faecium,
   Coaglulase negative staphylococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Fusobacterium spp., Morganella
   morganii, Pneumocystis jirovecii, previously known as pneumocystis carinii, F. hominis,
   streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Polyomavirus JC polyomavirus (the virus that
20 causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), Acinetobacter baumanni, Toxoplasma gondii,
   Cytomegalovirus, Aspergillus spp., Kaposi's Sarcoma, cryptosporidium, Cryptococcus neoformans,
   and Histoplasma capsulatum, among other bacteria, yeast, fungal, virus, prion, mold, actinomycetes,
   protozoal, parasitic, protist and helminthic infectious organisms.
                The systems and methods of the invention can be used to identify and monitor the
25 pathogenesis of disease in a subject, to select therapeutic interventions, and to monitor the
   effectiveness of the selected treatment. For example, for a patient having or at risk of a viral
   infection, the systems and methods of the invention can be used to identify the infectious virus, viral
   load, and to monitor white cell count and/or biomarkers indicative of the status of the infection. The
   identity of the virus can be used to select an appropriate therapy. The therapeutic intervention (e.g., a
30 particular antiviral agent) can be monitored as well to correlate the treatment regiman to the
   circulating concentration of antiviral agent and viral load to ensure that the patient is responding to
   treatment.
                The systems and methods of the invention can be used to monitor a viral infection in a
   subject, e.g., with a viral panel configured to detect Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr Virus, BK

   When clinicians suspect acute infection (e.g., in a subject with a report of recent risk behavior in
   association with symptoms and signs of the acute retroviral syndrome), a test for HIV RNA is usually
20 performed. High levels of HIV RNA detected in plasma through use of sensitive amplification assays
   (PCR, bDNA, or NASBA), in combination with a negative or indeterminate HIV antibody test,
   support the diagnosis of acute HIV infection. Low-level positive PCR results (<5000 copies/mL) are
   often not diagnostic of acute HIV infection and should be repeated to exclude a false-positive result.
   HIV RNA levels tend to be very high in acute infection; however, a low value may represent any
25 point on the upward or downward slope of the viremia associated with acute infection. Plasma HIV
   RNA levels during seroconversion do not appear significantly different in subjects who have acute
   symptoms versus those who are asymptomatic. Viremia occurs approximately 2 weeks prior to the
   detection of a specific immune response. Subjects diagnosed with acute HIV infection by HIV RNA.
   Fever and flu- or mono-like symptoms are common in acute HIV infection but are nonspecific rash,
30 mucocutaneous ulcers, or pharyngeal candidiasis and meningismus are more specific and should raise
   the index of suspicion testing still require antibody testing with confirmatory Western blot 3 to 6
   weeks later.
                Subjects undergoing HIV testing who are not suspected to be in the acute stages of infection
   should receive HIV antibody testing according to standard protocol. Antibody test results that are
35 initially negative should be followed up with HIV antibody testing at 3 months to identify HIV
   infection in individuals who may not yet have seroconverted at the time of initial presentation.

   Plasma HIV RNA levels indicate the magnitude of HIV replication and its associated rate of CD4+ T
   cell destruction, while CD4+ T-cell counts indicate the extent of HIV-induced immune damage
   already suffered. Regular, periodic measurement of plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4+ T-cell counts
   is necessary to determine the risk of disease progression in an HIV-infected individual and to
 5 determine when to initiate or modify antiretroviral treatment regimens.
                As rates of disease progression differ among individuals, treatment decisions should be
   individualized by level of risk indicated by plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4+ T-cell counts. Current
   WHO guidelines and recommendations for HIV therapy includes a combination of the following
   drugs, AZT (zidovudine), 3TC (lamivudine), ABC (abacavir), ATV (atazanavir), d4T (stavudine), ddl
10 (didanosine), NVP (nevirapine), EFV (efavirenz), FTC (emtricitabine), LPV (lopinavir), RTV
   (ritonavir), TDF (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in established regimens. Drug therapy for HIV is to
   commence in subjects who have a CD4 count < 350 cell/mm3 irrespective of clinical symptoms. At
   least one of the four following regimens for antiretroviral naive subjects is begun: 1) AZT + 3TC +
   EFV, 2) AZT + 3TC + NVP, 3) TDF + 3TC or FTC +EFV, or 4) TDF + 3TC or FTC + NVP. These
15 regimens avoid d4T (stavudine) to limit the disfiguring, unpleasant, and potentially life-threatening
   toxicities of this drug. Treatment failure is usually determined by viral load, a persistent value of
   5,000 copies/ml confirms treatment failure. In cases whereby viral load measurement is not available,
   immunological criteria (CD4 cell count) can be used to determine therapeutic progress. In cases of
   treatment failure, a boosted protease inhibitor plus two nucleoside analogs are added to the regimen
20 and is considered second line antiretroviral therapy. ATV plus low dose RTV, or LPV with low dose
   RTV is also considered second line therapy. Often the goal in treatment failure cases is simpler timed
   regimens and fixed doses.
                For subjects failing the second line treatment regimens should be maintained on a tolerated
   regimen for the duration. The use of potent combination antiretroviral therapy to suppress HIV
25 replication to below the levels of detection of sensitive plasma HIV RNA assays limits the potential
   for selection of antiretroviral-resistant HIV variants, the major factor limiting the ability of
   antiretroviral drugs to inhibit virus replication and delay disease progression. Therefore, maximum
   achievable suppression of HIV replication should be the goal of therapy. The most effective means to
   accomplish durable suppression of HIV replication is the simultaneous initiation of combinations of
30 effective anti-HIV drugs with which the subject has not been previously treated and that are not cross
   resistant with antiretroviral agents with which the subject has been treated previously. Each of the
   antiretroviral drugs used in combination therapy regimens should always be used according to
   optimum schedules and dosages. The available effective antiretroviral drugs are limited in number
   and mechanism of action, and cross-resistance between specific drugs has been documented.
35 Therefore, any change in antiretroviral therapy increases future therapeutic constraints.

                Monitoring HIV/AIDS subjects for viral load, drug levels, CD4 cell counts, and toxicity
   patterns in a single platform diagnostic method would provide distinct advantages to a subject. The
   systems and methods of the invention can be used in a multiplexed, no sample preparation, single
   detection method, automated system to determine the drug level, the toxicity or adverse effect
 5 determinants, and the potential biomarker of the progression of the disease. For example, a cartridge
   having portals or wells containing 1) magnetic particles having CD4 cell specific antibodies decorated
   on their surface, 2) magnetic particles having toxicity biomarker specific antibodies on their surface,
   and 3) magnetic particles having nucleic acid specific probes to identify viral load levels could be
   employed to rapidly determine and provide clinical management values for a given HIV/AIDS
10 subject.
                The systems and methods of the invention can also be used to monitor and diagnose immune
   disease in a subject (e.g., Crohn's disease, ileitis, enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable
   bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, as well as non-gastrointestinal immune disease). The relatively
   recent development of genetically engineered agents has the potential to alter the treatment of
15 immune disease radically, and Remicade (also known as Infliximab, an anti-TNF antibody) was
   introduced as a new therapeutic class with high efficacy, rapid onset of action, prolonged effect, and
   improved tolerance. However these agents are expensive and at least one-third of the eligible patients
   fail to show any useful response. Finding a means to predict those who will respond, and to anticipate
   relapse is, therefore, of obvious importance. T helper-type 1 (Thl) lymphocytes orchestrate much of
20 the inflammation in Crohn's disease mainly via production of TNF-alpha, which appears to play a
   pivotal role as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. It exerts its effects through its own family of receptors
   (TNFR1 and TNFR2), the end results of which include apoptosis, c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress
   activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) activation and NF-kappaB activation. Activated NF-kappaB
   enters the nucleus and induces transcription of genes associated with inflammation, host defense and
25 cell survival. The promoter region of the TNF gene lies between nucleotides -1 and -1300, and
   encompasses numerous polymorphic sites associated with potential binding sites for various
   transcription factors. Carriers of the TNF allele 2 (TNF2) (which contains a single base-pair
   polymorphism at the -308 promoter position) produce slightly more TNF-alpha in their intestinal
   mucosa than non-TNF2 carriers. TNF polymorphisms also appear to influence the nature and
30 frequency of extra-intestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A number of
   routes of inhibition of TNF are being investigated. Most extensively evaluated is the use of remicade.
   Several large controlled trials indicate that remicade has a role in treating patients with moderate to
   severely active Crohn's disease and in fistulating Crohn's disease. Small studies have shown possible
   associations between poor response to remicade and increasing mucosal levels of activated NF
35 kappaB, homozygosity for the polymorphism in exon 6 of TNFR2 (genotype Arg196Arg), positivity
   for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and with the presence of increased
                                                       - 98

   numbers of activated lamina propia mononuclear cells producing interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha.
   Thus, monitoring Crohn's disease patients for TNF-alpha and toxicity patterns in a single platform
   diagnostic method would have distinct advantages. The method of the invention can be a
   multiplexed, no sample preparation, single detection method, automated system to determine the drug
 5 level, the toxicity or adverse effect determinants, and the potential biomarker of the progression of the
   disease. For example, a cartridge having portals or wells containing 1) magnetic particles having anti
   TNF-alpha specific antibodies decorated on their surface, 2) magnetic particles having toxicity
   biomarker specific antibodies on their surface, and 3) magnetic particles having specific probes to
   identify disease markers of progression could be employed to rapidly determine and provide clinical
10 management values for a given Crohn's disease patient.
                The systems and methods of the invention can also be used to monitor and diagnose
   infectious disease and inflammation in a multiplexed, automated, no sample preparation system.
   Such systems and methods could be used to monitor, for example, bacteremia, sepsis, and/or
   Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). Early diagnosis is clinically important as this
15 type of infection, if left untreated, can lead to organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, hypotension,
   refractory (septic) shock/SIRS shock, and/or Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). For a
   typical patient, many bacterial or fungal infections are the result of incubation at the time of
   admission to a healthcare setting and are termed healthcare-associated infections (HAI), also known
   as nosocomial, hospital-acquired or hospital-onset infections. Healthcare-associated infections are
20 most commonly caused by viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens and are commonly transmitted via
   wounds, invasive devices (catheters, tracheostomy, intubation, surgical drains) or ventilators and are
   found as urinary tract infections, surgical site infections, or a form of pneumonia. Within hours after
   admission, a patient's flora begins to acquire characteristics of the surrounding bacterial pool. Most
   infections that become clinically evident after 48 hours of hospitalization are considered hospital
25 acquired and the pathogens should be investigated in all febrile patients who are admitted for a
   nonfebrile illness or those who develop clinical deterioration unexplained by the initial diagnosis.
   More careful and selective use of antimicrobial agents, such as antibiotics, is also desirable to
   decrease the selection pressure for the emergence of resistant strains. Infections that occur after the
   patient is discharged from the hospital can be considered healthcare-associated if the organisms were
30 acquired during the hospital stay. Patient-related risk factors for invasion of colonizing pathogen
   include severity of illness, underlying immunocompromised state and/or the length of in-patient stay.
   Risk factors for the development of catheter-associated bloodstream infections in neonates include
   catheter hub colonization, exit site colonization, catheter insertion after the first week of life, duration
   of parenteral nutrition, and extremely low birth weight (<1000 g) at the time of catheter insertion. In
35 patients in the PICU risks, for catheter-associated bloodstream infections increase with neutropenia,
   prolonged catheter dwell time (>7 days), use of percutaneously placed CVL (higher than tunneled or
                                                       - 99

    implanted devices), and frequent manipulation of lines. Candida infections are increasingly important
   pathogens in the NICU. Risk factors for the development of candidemia in neonates include
   gestational age less than 32 weeks, 5-min Apgar scores of less than 5, shock, disseminated
    intravascular coagulopathy, prior use of intralipids, parenteral nutrition administration, CVL use, H2
 5 blocker administration, intubation, or length of stay longer than 7 days. Risk factors for the
    development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in pediatric patients include reintubation,
    genetic syndromes, immunodeficiency, and immunosuppression. In neonates, a prior episode of
   bloodstream infection is a risk factor for the development of VAP. Risk factors for the development
    of healthcare-associated urinary tract infection in pediatric patients include bladder catheterization,
10 prior antibiotic therapy, and cerebral palsy. Among the categories of bacteria most known to infect
    immunocompromised patients are MRSA (Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus), gram
   positive bacteria and Helicobacter, which is gram-negative. While there are antibiotic drugs that can
   treat diseases caused by Gram-positive MRSA, there are currently few effective drugs for
   Acinetobacter. Common pathogens in bloodstream infections are coagulase-negative staphylococci,
15 Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, Candida albicans and pathogens for
   pneumonia such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and
    Haemophilus influenza account for many infections. Pathogens for urinary tract infections include
    Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Pseudomonnas aeruginosa. Gram-negative enteric organisms
    are additionally common in urinary tract infections. Surgical site infections include Staphylococcus
20  aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. The infectious agent can be
    selected from, without limitation, pathogens associated with sepsis, such as Acinetobacter baumannii,

                Sepsis or septic shock are serious medical conditions that are characterized by a whole-body
   inflammatory state (systemic inflammatory response syndrome or SIRS) and the presence of a known
   or suspected infection. Sepsis is defined as SIRS in the presence of an infection, septic shock is
   defined as sepsis with refractory arterial hypotension or hypoperfusion abnormalities in spite of
 5 adequate fluid resuscitation, and severe sepsis is defined as sepsis with organ dysfunction,
   hypoperfusion, or hypotension. In addition to symptoms related to the provoking infection, sepsis is
   characterized by presence of acute inflammation present throughout the entire body, and is, therefore,
   frequently associated with fever and leukocytosis or low white blood cell count and lower-than
   average temperature, and vomiting. It is currently believed that sepsis is the host's immune response
10 to an infection and it is thought that this response causes most of the symptoms of sepsis, resulting in
   hemodynamic consequences and damage to organs. SIRS is characterized by hemodynamic
   compromise and resultant metabolic derangement. Outward physical symptoms of this response
   frequently include a high heart rate (above 90 beats per minute), high respiratory rate (above 20
   breaths per minute), elevated WBC count (above 12,000) and elevated or lowered body temperature
15 (under 36 'C (97 'F) or over 38 'C (100 'F)). Sepsis is differentiated from SIRS by the presence of a
   known pathogen. For example, SIRS and a positive blood culture for a pathogen indicates the
   presence of sepsis. Without a known infection, it's not possible to classify the above symptoms as
   sepsis, only SIRS. SIRS causes widespread activation of acute-phase proteins, affecting the
   complement system and the coagulation pathways, which then cause damage to the vasculature as
20 well as to the organs. Various neuroendocrine counter-regulatory systems are then activated as well,
   often compounding the problem. Even with immediate and aggressive treatment, this may progress to
   multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and eventually death. The laboratory component of sepsis
   diagnosis can include several markers are considered at once and/or measured serially. A number of
   studies have examined the value of combining currently available markers like GRO-alpha, High
25 mobility group-box 1 protein (HMBG-1), IL-i receptor, IL-i receptor antagonist, IL-lb, IL-2, IL-4,
   IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-18, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1), macrophage
   migration inhibitory factor (MIF), osteopontin, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell
   expressed and secreted; or CCL5), TNF-a, C-reactive protein (CRP), CD64, and monocyte
   chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1). Additionally, the systems and methods can be designed to monitor
30 certain proteins characteristic of sepsis, such as adenosine deaminase binding protein (ABP-26),
   inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), and procalcitonin
   (PCT). Sepsis is usually treated in the intensive care unit with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. If
   fluid replacement is insufficient to maintain blood pressure, specific vasopressor medications can be
   used. Mechanical ventilation and dialysis may be needed to support the function of the lungs and
35 kidneys, respectively. To guide therapy, a central venous catheter and an arterial catheter may be
   placed. Sepsis patients may require preventive measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers and
                                                        - 101

   pressure ulcers, and some patients may benefit from tight control of blood sugar levels with insulin
   (targeting stress hyperglycemia), low-dose corticosteroids, or activated drotrecogin alfa (recombinant
   protein C). For an immunocompromised patient, or a patient with a suspected infection that may be
   experiencing sepsis or SIRS, such methods and systems of the invention provide a diagnostic platform
 5 for the rapid identification of one or more pathogens, and whether or not the pathogens are resistant to
   certain therapies (for the selection of an appropriate antimicrobial therapy). The platform as
   described allows for the simultaneous determination of the levels of the factors (e.g., GRO-alpha,
   High mobility group-box 1 protein (HMBG-1), IL-1 receptor, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-lb, IL-2,
   IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-18, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1), macrophage
10 migration inhibitory factor (MIF), osteopontin, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell
   expressed and secreted; or CCL5), TNF-a, C-reactive protein (CRP), CD64, and monocyte
   chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1)) and/or proteins (e.g., adenosine deaminase binding protein (ABP-26),
   inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), and procalcitonin
   (PCT)) thought to be involved in SIRS, allowing for the optimization for the treatment of sepsis and
15 SIRS. Thus, this platform reduces the empirical protocols and/or use of non-specific/general
   antimicrobials that may or may not be targeting the specific pathogen and/or the underlying system
   dysfunction for a given patient. This platform allows for rapid and accurate diagnoses, which can
   point to effective therapy, providing a key component to a physician's decision making and reducing
   morbidity and mortality.
20              To determine whether a patient has sepsis, it is necessary to identify the presence of a
   pathogen. To most effectively treat a patient, the earliest initiation of appropriate therapy is critical.
   Antimicrobial and other treatments for sepsis rely on the classification of pathogens at multiple levels,
   including the identification of an agent as 1) bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic or otherwise; 2) gram
   positive, gram negative, yeast, or mold, 3) species, and 4) susceptibility.
25              Each of these levels of specificity improves the time to initiation of appropriate therapy, and
   each step further down the track will lead to a narrowing of therapeutic agents to the most specific set.
   Without absolute susceptibility data, empiric approaches to care rely on the information available
   about the pathogen (at whichever level) and the pattern of pathogen frequency and susceptibility
   trends in the hospital of another site of care. Thus, certain categories of pathogens are frequently
30 presumed to be causative until there are more data to refine the pairing of pathogen and therapy.
   Specifically, these targets fall into the ESKAPE category (which is a series of resistant pathogens)
   and the SPACE category, which is a set of high virulence pathogens that require isolation of patients.
                In addition to identifying these pathogens in multiple sample types (blood, tissue, urine, etc.),
   another method to distinguish symptomatic patients, for instance, patients with systemic inflammatory
35 syndrome, or SIRS, from septic patients, is to use biomarkers that correlate either individually or via
   an index, to identify patients with infection. In cases where infections are not detected due to
                                                         - 102

   antimicrobial therapy interference with diagnostics, immune system control of the therapy, or
   otherwise, these biomarkers, which can be multiple types of analytes (cytokines, metabolites, DNA,
   RNA/gene expression, etc.) will indicate infection and thus sepsis.
                To generate the diagnostic information required for both the presence of an infection and
 5 some level of species identification, one panel could be: (i) gram positiive clusters (e.g., S. aureus,
   and CoNS (coagulase negative staph)); (ii) gram positive chains/pairs (e.g., Strep spp., mitis,
   pneumonia spp., agalactiae spp., pyogenes spp., Enterococcus spp.(E. faecium, E. fecalis); (iii) gram
   negative rods (e.g., E. coli, Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Acinetobacter spp.,
   Stenotrophomonas spp.); (iv) SPACE (e.g., Serratia spp., Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp.,
10 Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp.); (v) Pseudomonas (e.g., Pseudomonas spp.); (vi) ESKAPE (E.
   faecium, Staphylococcus aureas, Klebsiella spp., Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter
   spp.); and (vii) Pan-Bacterial (all bacterial species).
                This panel should be used in conjunction with a fungal assay for full coverage. The
   categories represent the information required for an effective intervention with appropriate therapy,
15 given that each site of care will have an empirically derived approach based on a positive response to
   gram +, gram -, etc. The species identified in each category represent those that would fit under each
   heading, but are not comprehensive. Further, a pan-bacterial marker is included to cover any species
   that is not covered by the diagnostic method employed for each category. Further, the combination of
   results will also give an indication of the species, although not fully, if included as described above.
20 Cross-referencing positives and negatives by category allow a process of elimination approach to
   identify some of the species, probabilistically.
                In addition to pathogen panels, a standalone or companion test could be performed for
   biomarkers that can indicate sepsis. Examples of these markers are below, and may be used
   individually or in combination: IL-lp, GRO-alpha, High mobility group-box 1 protein (HMBG-1),
25 IL-I receptor, IL-I receptor antagonist, IL-Ib, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-18,
   macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF),
   osteopontin, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted; or CCL5), IL
    10, GM-CSF, MCP-1, TNF-a., hsCRP, PCT, LFB, and lactate.
                The systems and methods of the invention can also be used to monitor and diagnose heart
30 disease in a subject, such as a myocardial infarction. Cardiac markers or cardiac enzymes are proteins
   that leak out of injured myocardial cells and are used to assess cardiac injury. Cardiac markers
   include, without limitation, the enzymes SGOT, LDH, the MB subtype of the enzyme creatine kinase,
   and cardiac troponins (T and I). The cardiac troponins T and I which are released within 4-6 hours of
   an attack of myocardial infarction (and remain elevated for up to 2 weeks) have nearly complete
35 tissue specificity and are now the preferred markers for assessing myocardial damage. Elevated
   troponins in the setting of chest pain may accurately predict a high likelihood of a myocardial
                                                        - 103
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   infarction in the near future. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction is typically based upon subject
   history, ECG, and cardiac markers. When damage to the heart occurs, levels of cardiac markers rise
   over time, which is why blood tests for them are taken over a 24-hour period. Because these enzyme
   levels are not elevated immediately following a heart attack, patients presenting with chest pain are
 5 generally treated with the assumption that a myocardial infarction has occurred and then evaluated for
   a more precise diagnosis. A MI is a medical emergency which requires immediate medical attention.
   Treatment attempts to salvage as much myocardium as possible and to prevent further complications,
   thus the phrase "time is muscle". Oxygen, aspirin, and nitroglycerin are usually administered as soon
   as possible. Thus, in the acute setting, monitoring Troponin I and T, as well as potential other
10 biomarkers of cardiac ischemia, in addition to drug therapy and toxicity patterns in a single platform
   diagnostic method would have distinct advantages. The systems and methods of the invention can be
   used to provide a multiplexed, no sample preparation, single detection method, automated system to
   determine the drug level, the toxicity or adverse effect determinants, and the potential biomarker of
   the progression of the disease. For example, a cartridge having portals or wells containing 1)

   2) magnetic particles having toxicity biomarker specific antibodies on their surface, and 3) magnetic
   particles having specific probes to identify disease markers of progression could be employed to
   rapidly determine and provide clinical management values for a given myocardial infarction patient.
                One or more multi-well cartridges can be configured for use in the systems and methods of
20 the invention and prepared with at least one whole blood sample from the patient; magnetic particles
   for detecting each of the analytes to be detected (one or more small molecules; one or more
   metabolites of the one or more small molecules; metabolic biomarker such as described for the
   hepatic function panel); and dilution and wash buffers. Liver function tests are done on a patient's
   serum or plasma sample and clinical biochemistry laboratory blood analysis furnishes crucial data
25 regarding the condition of the patient's liver. A "hepatic function panel" is a blood test wherein low
   or high levels of one or more enzymes may point to liver diseases or damage. For example, the
   hepatic function panel can include one or more of the following analyte detection assays: one or more
   small molecules; one or more metabolites of the one or more small molecules; a biologic, metabolic
   biomarkers; genotyping, gene expression profiling; and proteomic analysis.
30              A hepatic function panel can include analysis of one or more of the following proteins in a
   patient or subject biological sample: 1) albumin (the major constituent of the total protein in the liver;
   while the remnant is called globulin; albumin must be present as 3.9 to 5.0 g/dL, hypoalbuminaemia
   indicates poor nutrition, lower protein catabolism, cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome); 2) aspartate
   transaminase (AST) (also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase or aspartate
35 aminotransferase , is an enzyme in liver parenchymal cells and is normally 10 to 34 IU/L; elevated
   levels are indicative of acute liver damage); 3) alanine transaminase (ALT) (also known as serum
                                                       - 104

   glutamic pyruvic transaminase or alanine aminotransferase, is an enzyme is present in hepatocytes at
   levels between 8 to 37 IU/L; elevated levels are indicative of acute liver damage in viral hepatitis or
   paracetamol overdose; the ratio of AST to ALT is used to differentiate between the reasons of liver
   damage); 4) alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (an enzyme that is present in the cells lining the biliary ducts
 5 of the liver; the normal range is 44 to 147 IU/L and the level rises in case of infiltrative diseases of the
   liver, intrahepatic cholestasis or large bile duct obstruction); 5) Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase
   (GGT) (a more sensitive marker for cholestatic damage than ALP, is very specific to the liver; the
   standard range is 0 to 51 IU/L; both acute and chronic alcohol toxicity raise GGT; the reason of an
   isolated elevation in ALP can be detected by GGT); 6) total bilirubin (TBIL) (an increase in the total
10 bilirubin can lead to jaundice and can be attributed to cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, hemolytic anemias, or
   internal hemorrhage); 7) direct bilirubin; 8) prothrombin time (PTT) (hepatic cell damage and bile
   flow obstruction can cause changes to blood clotting time); 9) alpha-fetoprotein test (elevated levels
   indicate hepatitis or cancer); 10) lactate dehydrogenase; and 11) mitochondrial antibodies (if present
   may indicate chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, or other autoimmune disorders). The
15 proteins described above would be analyzed in the hepatic function panel using the systems and
   methods of the invention.
                An additional hepatic function panel may include genotyping of cytochrome P450 enzymes.
   The cytochrome P450 superfamily (CYP) is a large and diverse group of enzymes. The function of
   most CYP enzymes is to catalyze the oxidation of organic substances. The substrates of CYP
20 enzymes include metabolic intermediates such as lipids and steroidal hormones, as well as xenobiotic
   substances such as drugs and other toxic chemicals. CYPs are the major enzymes involved in drug
   metabolism and bioactivation, accounting for ca. 75% of the total metabolism. Most drugs undergo
   biotransformation and are eventually excreted from the body; and many require bioactivation to form
   the active compound. The CYP enzymes that metabolize many medications include CYP3A4/5
25 (36%), CYP2D6 (19%), CYP2C8/9 (16%), and CYPlA2 (11%).
                Cytochrome P450 genotyping tests are used to determine how well a patient or subject
   metabolizes a drug. The results of cytochrome P450 tests can be used to divide individuals into four
   main types:
                (i) Poor metabolizers. Certain drugs are metabolized more slowly than normal and the
30 medication will have a longer half life and possibly increase the likelihood that it will cause side
   effects.
                (ii) Normal metabolizers. Drugs will be metabolized at an average rate and thus is indicative
   that there is a benefit from treatment and points to fewer side effects than are other individuals who
   don't metabolize those particular medications as well.
                                                       - 105
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

                (iii) Intermediate metabolizers. Drugs may or may not be metabolized at an average rate. At
   least one gene involved in drug metabolism is suspected to function abnormally. There then is a
   predisposition to metabolize certain drugs differently.
                (iv) Ultra rapid metabolizers. Drugs are metabolized faster and more efficiently than the
 5 average. Since the metabolic rate is higher than average, some medications are inactivated sooner or
   are excreted sooner than normal and the medication may not have the desired efficacy.
                Currently, genotyping the genes responsible for these enzymes across a population has been
   shown that polymorphic differences in these enzymes can lead to variation in efficacy and toxicity of
   some drugs. Assessing cytochrome P450 status in a patient sample can be accomplished by
10 measuring the enzyme activity of the sample, or determining if a genetic difference occurs in one of
   the genes of this metabolic system in the genome. Genotyping requires a cell sample representative
   of the patient or subject's genome and the analysis is aimed at determining genetic differences in
   these clinically important genes. Alternatively, CYP450 enzyme phenotyping (identifying enzymatic
   metabolizer status) can be accomplished by administering a test enzyme substrate to a patient and
15 monitoring parent substrate and metabolite concentrations over time (e.g., in urine). However, testing
   and interpretation are time-consuming and inconvenient; as a result, phenotyping is seldom
   performed.
                Below is a listing of the possible hepatic metabolic enzymes that may be part of a hepatic
   function panel.
20              CYP2C 19 metabolizes several important types of drugs, including proton-pump inhibitors,
   diazepam, propranolol, imipramine, and amitriptyline. FDA cleared the test "based on results of a
   study conducted by the manufacturers of hundreds of DNA samples as well as on a broad range of
   supporting peer-reviewed literature." According to FDA labeling, "Information about CYP2D6
   genotype may be used as an aid to clinicians in determining therapeutic strategy and treatment doses
25 for therapeutics that are metabolized by the CYP2D6 product." Thus, a hepatic function panel
   employing the methods of the invention, may be used to genotype patient or subject samples to assess
   the status of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system to then optimize therapeutic efficacy and safety.
                CYP2D6 (cytochrome P450 2D6) is the best studied of the DMEs and acts on one-fourth of
   all prescription drugs, including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), tricylic
30 antidepressants (TCA), beta-blockers such as Inderal and the Type IA antiarrhythmics.
   Approximately 10% of the population has a slow acting form of this enzyme and 7% a super-fast
   acting form. Thirty-five percent are carriers of a non-functional 2D6 allele, especially elevating the
   risk of ADRs when these individuals are taking multiple drugs. Drugs that CYP2D6 metabolizes
   include Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Effexor, hydrocodone , amitriptyline, Claritin, cyclobenzaprine, Haldol,
35 metoprolol, Rythmol, Tagamet, tamoxifen, dextromethorphan, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics,
   antidepressants, and morphine derivatives, including many of the most prescribed drugs and the over
                                                         - 106
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   the-counter diphenyihydramine drugs (e.g., Allegra, Dytuss, and Tusstat). CYP2D6 is responsible for
   activating the pro-drug codeine into its active form and the drug is therefore inactive in CYP2D6 slow
   metabolizers.
                CYP2C9 (cytochrome P450 2C9) is the primary route of metabolism for Coumadin
 5 (warfarin). Approximately 10% of the population are carriers of at least one allele for the slow
   metabolizing form of CYP2C9 and may be treatable with 50% of the dose at which normal
   metabolizers are treated. Other drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 include Amaryl, isoniazid, ibuprofen,
   amitriptyline, Dilantin, Hyzaar, THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), naproxen, and Viagra.
                CYP2C 19 (cytochrome P450 2C 19) is associated with the metabolism of carisoprodol,
10 diazepam, Dilantin, and Prevacid.
                CYPIA2 (cytochrome P450 1A2) is associated with the metabolism of amitriptyline,
   olanzapine, haloperidol, duloxetine, propranolol, theophylline, caffeine, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide,
   estrogens, tamoxifen, and cyclobenzaprine.
                NAT2 (N-acetyltransferase 2) is a secondary drug metabolizing enzyme that acts on
15 isoniazid, procainamide, and Azulfidine. The frequency of the NAT2 "slow acetylator" in various
   worldwide populations ranges from 10% to more than 90%.
                DPD (Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase) is responsible for the metabolism of Fluorouracil
   (5-FU), one of the most successful and widely used chemotherapy drugs.
                UGT1A1 (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase) variations can lead to severe even fatal reactions to
20 the first dost of Camptosar (irinotecan).
                5HTT (Serotonin Transporter) helps determine whether people are likely to respond to SSRls,
   a class of medications that includes citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline, among others,
   and often is prescribed for depression or anxiety.
                Diagnostic genotyping tests for certain CYP450 enzymes are now available. Some tests are
25 offered as in house laboratory-developed test services, which do not require U.S. Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA) approval but which must meet CLIA quality standards for high complexity
   testing. The AmpliChip@ (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.) is the only FDA-cleared test for CYP450
   genotyping. The AmpliChip@ is a microarray consisting of many DNA sequences complementary to
   2 CYP450 genes and applied in microscopic quantities at ordered locations on a solid surface (chip).
30 The AmpliChip@ tests the DNA from a patient's white blood cells collected in a standard
   anticoagulated blood sample for 29 polymorphisms and mutations for the CYP2D6 gene and 2
   polymorphisms for the CYP2C 19 gene.
                Therefore, the invention features a multiplexed analysis of a single blood sample (e.g., a
   single blood draw, or any other type of patient sample described herein) from a patient to determine a)
35 liver enzymatic status, as well as b) the genotype of key metabolic enzymes to then be able to design

   pharmacotherapy regimes for optimal therapeutic care using the systems and methods of the
   invention.
                The systems and methods of the invention can include one or more multi-well cartridges
   prepared with at least one whole blood sample from the patient; magnetic particles for detecting each
 5 of the analytes to be detected; analyte antibodies; multivalent binding agents; and/or dilution and
   wash buffers for use in a multiplexed assay as described above.
                Nephrotoxicity
                Renal toxicity is a common side effect of use of xenobiotics and early, rapid detection of
10 early stages of nephrotoxicity may assist in medical decision making. Early reports of detection of
   renal toxicity suggest that increased mRNA expression of certain genes can be monitored. However,
   others have suggested that markers of renal toxicity can be detected in urine. These markers include:
   kim-1, lipocalin-2, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), timp-1, clusterin, osteopontin,
   vimentin, and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). More broadly, detection of DNA, heavy metal ions or BUN
15 levels in urine can be useful clinical information. Thus, the methods and utlity of the instant
   invention also includes the ability to detect these markers of renal toxicity. Optionally, a hepatic
   function panel may also include one or two hallmark biomarkers of nephrotoxicity, or visa versa.
                Non-Agglomeration-Based Assays and Methods
20              In some embodiments, the magnetic particles described herein may be utilized in an assay
   that does not feature particle agglomeration. For example, the magnetic particles may be used to
   capture or concentrate an analyte, e.g., by passing a liquid sample containing the analyte over
   magnetic particles that include binding moieties specific for the analyte. Some advantages of this
   approach include a) no clusters need be formed (the clusters may be inherently unstable over a certain
25 size, leading to increased CV's); b) no clustering may not require vortexing as flow shear forces may
   dislodge non-specific binding of magnetic particles, c) fluidic handling steps may be reduced, and d)
   miniaturization of the assay may favor these non-agglomerative methods. Broadly, two models for
   surface based detection include: (i) changes in T2 signal arising from the depletion of magnetic
   particles from a solution and (ii) changes in T2 signal arising from magnetic particle enrichment of a
30 surface.
                The magnetic particles derivatized with a binding moiety can be held in position by an
   external magnetic field while sample containing the corresponding analyte is circulated past the
   "trapped" magnetic particles allowing for capture and/or concentrate the analyte of interest. The
   particles may be pulled to the side or bottom of the assay vessel, or a magnetizable mesh or
35 magnetizable metal foam with appropriate pore size can be present in the reaction vessel, creating
                                                       - 108
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   very high local magnetic gradients. An advantage of having the mesh/metal foam in the reaction
   vessel is that the distance each magnetic particle needs to travel to be "trapped" or "captured" can be
   very short, improving assay kinetics.
                Another non-agglomerative assay is to have surfaces derivitized with ligands complementary
 5 to the binding moiety present on the magnetic particle and using a capture/depletion/flow through
   format. Specific binding of magnetic particles to a surface depletes magnetic particles from the bulk
   particle suspension used in the assay, thus leading to a change in the T 2 value in the reaction volume
   interrogated by the MR reader. Pre-incubation of the particles with the sample containing analyte can
   reduce/inhibit the specific binding/capture/depletion of the magnetic particle by the derivitized
10 surface in proportion to the concentration of analyte in the sample. One example of this type of assay
   approach has been demonstrated using PhyNexus affinity chromatography micropipette tips. The
   200ul PhyTips contain a 20 pl volume of resin bed trapped between 2 fits. The resin bed consists of
   200 pm cross-linked agarose beads derivitized with avidin, protein A, protein G, or an analyte. A
   programmable electronic pipettor can aspirate and dispense various volumes at various flow rates.
15 The magnetic particles flow through the pores created by the packed agarose bead resin bed. By
   repeatedly passing the appropriate magnetic particle suspension over the trapped resin bed to allow
   for productive interactions to occur between, say, an avidin-derivatized agarose bead resin bed and
   biotin-derivatized magnetic particles, some of the magnetic particles will specifically bind to and be
   depleted from the particles suspension. By measuring the T 2 of the particle suspension before and
20 after exposure to the agarose resin bed, the amount of particle depletion can be quantified.
                Another non-agglomerative assay format is similar to that described above, but uses
   derivatized magnetizable metal foam to replace the resin bed. The advantage of the metal foam as the
   solid phase substrate is that when placed in a magnetic field, the metal foam generates very high local
   magnetic field gradients over very short distances which can attract the derivatized magnetic particles
25 and bring them in contact with the complementary binding partner on the metal foam and improve the
   chances of a specific productive interaction. By optimizing the pore size and surface area of the metal
   foam, the assay kinetics can be vastly improved because the particles need to travel much shorter
   distances to find a complementary surface to bind. The particle concentration in the flow-through
   reaction volume will be reduced inversely proportional to the analyte concentration in the sample and
30 can be quantified using the MR reader. The metal foam can be nickel bearing directly bound his
   tagged moieties, or can be nickel treated with aminosilane and covalently linkedbinding moieties.
   This process has been demonstrated using aminosilane-treated nickel metal foam with 400 pm pores
   decorated with anti-creatinine antibodies and shown to specifically bind creatinine-derivatized
   magnetic particles.

                To prepare small circular pieces of nickel metal foam (NMF), NMF material is incubated
   with deionized water and then frozen. The frozen water in the NMF crevices support the foam so that
   it will not collapse or create differential edges. Next, a punch is used to create uniform-sized pieces
   of NMF; a hammer and punch (e.g., a circular tube having a circular cutting edge at one end) is used
 5 to cut out circular pieces, e.g., 2-3 mm in size, of the frozen foam. A wire is then used to poke out the
   pieces, which are dried in a glassware oven. To derivatize the NMF pieces and prepare them for use
   in the devices and methods described herein, the following steps are performed. First, NMF pieces
   are cleaned with 2M H2 SO4 in a sonicator, and sulfuric acid solution is used to clean the NMF and to
   roughen the NMF surfaces in order to assist in subsequent attachment of the amino groups of
10 aminosilane. The acid-washed NMF pieces are then rinsed with deionized water to remove any
   residual acid solution, and the NMF pieces are dried in a glassware oven. Next the NMF pieces are
   derivatized with aminosilane, and 70kD aminodextran is covalently attached. The aminodextran is
   then optionally crosslinked with gluteraldehyde. Specific antibodies, oligonucleotides, and analytes
   can then be covalently attached to the amino groups on the aminodextran using various chemistries,
15 and the derivatized NMF pieces are incubated to block non-specific binding. Common blockers
   include but are not limited to BSA, non-fat dried milk, detergents, salmon sperm DNA, among others.
                Further, there are examples of assays that would be aimed at detecting a physical property
   change in a liquid sample. As described in pending cases, PCT/US2009/062537 (published as
   W02010/051362) and PCT/US2008/073346 (published as W02009/026164), coagulation of blood
20 can be determined by the instant methods described therein. Further, other physical properties may be
   detected such as solidification, changes in density and may have uses in determining curing of
   materials (plastic compositions), changes in food and food products with time, contamination of
   products found in nature, and monitoring certain biological fluids such as urine as a function of
   kidney function.
25              The magnetic particles utilized in the non-agglomerative methods described herein can have
   an average diameter of from 10 nm to 1200 nm (e.g., from 10 to 50, 50 to 150, 150 to 250, 200 to
   350, 250 to 450, 300 to 500, 450 to 650, 500 to 700 nm, 700 to 850, 800 to 950, 900 to 1050, or from
    1000 to 1200 nm).

                Amplification and Detection of Nucleic Acids from Complex Samples
                Systems and methods of the invention can include amplification based nucleic acid detection
   assays conducted starting with complex samples (e.g., for diagnostic, forensic, and environmental
 5 analyses).
                Sample preparation must also remove or provide resistance for common PCR inhibitors found
   in complex samples (e.g., body fluids, soil, or other complex milieu). Common inhibitors are listed in
   Table 5 (see also, Wilson, Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 63:3741 (1997)). Inhibitors typically act by
   either prevention of cell lysis, degradation or sequestering a target nucleic acid, and/or inhibition of a
10 polymerase activity. The most commonly employed polymerase, Taq, is inhibited by the presence of
   0.10%blood in a reaction. Very recently, mutant Taq polymerases have been engineered that are
   resistant to common inhibitors (e.g., hemoglobin and/or humic acid) found in blood and soil
   (Kermekchiev et al., Nucl. Acid. Res., 37(5): e40, (2009)). Manufacturer recommendations indicate
   these mutations enable direct amplification from up to 20% blood. Despite resistance afforded by the
15 mutations, accurate real time PCR detection is complicated due to fluorescence quenching observed
   in the presence of blood sample (Kermekchiev et al., Nucl. Acid. Res., 37:e40 (2009)).

                Polymerase chain reaction amplification of DNA or cDNA is a tried and trusted
   methodology; however, as discussed above, polymerases are inhibited by agents contained in crude
   samples, including but not limited to commonly used anticoagulants and hemoglobin. Recently
 5 mutant Taq polymerases have been engineered to harbor resistance to common inhibitors found in
   blood and soil. Currently available polymerases, e.g., HemoKlenTaq TM (New England BioLabs, Inc.,
   Ipswich, MA) as well as OmniTaq TM and OmniKlenTaq TM (DNA Polymerase Technology, Inc., St.
   Louis, MO) are mutant (e.g., N-terminal truncation and/or point mutations) Taq polymerase that
   render them capable of amplifying DNA in the presence of up to 10%, 20% or 25% whole blood,
10 depending on the product and reaction conditions (See, e.g., Kermekchiev et al. Nucl. Acids Res.
   31:6139 (2003); and Kermekchiev et al., Nucl. Acid. Res., 37:e40 (2009); and see U.S. Patent No.
   7,462,475). Additionally, Phusion Blood Direct PCR Kits (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland), include
   a unique fusion DNA polymerase enzyme engineered to incorporate a double-stranded DNA binding
                                                                   -112

   domain, which allows amplification under conditions which are typically inhibitory to conventional
   polymerases such as Taq or Pfu, and allow for amplification of DNA in the presence of up to about
   40% whole blood under certain reaction conditions. See Wang et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 32:1197
   (2004); and see U.S. Patent Nos. 5,352,778 and 5,500,363. Furthermore, Kapa Blood PCR Mixes
 5 (Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA), provide a genetically engineered DNA polymerase enzyme which
   allows for direct amplification of whole blood at up to about 20% of the reaction volume under
   certain reaction conditions. Despite these breakthroughs, direct optical detection of generated
   amplicons is not possible with existing methods since fluorescence, absorbance, and other light based
   methods yield signals that are quenched by the presence of blood. See Kermekchiev et al., Nucl.
10 Acid. Res., 37:e40 (2009).
                We have found that complex samples such as whole blood can be directly amplified using
   about 5%, about 10%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 25%, about 40%, and about 45% or
   more whole blood in amplification reactions, and that the resulting amplicons can be directly detected
   from amplification reaction using magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation measurements upon the
15 addition of conjugated magnetic particles bound to oligonucleotides complementary to the target
   nucleic acid sequence. Alternatively, the magnetic particles can be added to the sample prior to
   amplification. Thus, provided are methods for the use of nucleic acid amplification in a complex
   dirty sample, hybridization of the resulting amplicon to paramagnetic particles, followed by direct
   detection of hybridized magnetic particle conjugate and target amplicons using magnetic particle
20 based detection systems. In particular embodiments, direct detection of hybridized magnetic particle
   conjugates and amplicons is via MR relaxation measurements (e.g., T 2, T1, T1/T2 hybrid, T2*, etc).
   Further provided are methods which are kinetic, in order to quantify the original nucleic acid copy
   number within the sample (e.g., sampling and nucleic acid detection at pre-defined cycle numbers,
   comparison of endogenous internal control nucleic acid, use of exogenous spiked homologous
25 competitive control nucleic acid).
                The terms "amplification" or "amplify" or derivatives thereof as used herein mean one or
   more methods known in the art for copying a target or template nucleic acid, thereby increasing the
   number of copies of a selected nucleic acid sequence. Amplification may be exponential or linear. A
   target or template nucleic acid may be either DNA or RNA. The sequences amplified in this manner
30 form an "amplified region" or "amplicon." Primer probes can be readily designed by those skilled in
   the art to target a specific template nucleic acid sequence. In certain preferred embodiments, resulting
   amplicons are short to allow for rapid cycling and generation of copies. The size of the amplicon can
   vary as needed to provide the ability to discriminate target nucleic acids from non-target nucleic
   acids. For example, amplicons can be less than about 1,000 nucleotides in length. Desirably the
35 amplicons are from 100 to 500 nucleotides in length (e.g., 100 to 200, 150 to 250, 300 to 400, 350 to
   450, or 400 to 500 nucleotides in length).

                While the exemplary methods described hereinafter relate to amplification using polymerase
   chain reaction ("PCR"), numerous other methods are known in the art for amplification of nucleic
   acids (e.g., isothermal methods, rolling circle methods, etc.). Those skilled in the art will understand
   that these other methods may be used either in place of, or together with, PCR methods. See, e.g.,
 5 Saiki, "Amplification of Genomic DNA" in PCR Protocols, Innis et al., Eds., Academic Press, San
   Diego, Calif., pp 13-20 (1990); Wharam et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 29:E54 (2001); Hafner et al.,
   Biotechniques, 30:852 (2001). Further amplification methods suitable for use with the present
   methods include, for example, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, reverse transcription PCR
   (RT-PCR), ligase chain reaction (LCR), transcription based amplification system (TAS), transcription
10 mediated amplification (TMA), nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) method, the
   strand displacement amplification (SDA) method, the loop mediated isothermal amplification
   (LAMP) method, the isothermal and chimeric primer-initiated amplification of nucleic acid (ICAN)
   method, and the smart amplification system (SMAP) method. These methods, as well as others are
   well known in the art and can be adapted for use in conjunction with provided methods of detection of
15 amplified nucleic acid.
                The PCR method is a technique for making many copies of a specific template DNA
   sequence. The PCR process is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,195; 4,683,202; and 4,965,188,
   each of which is incorporated herein by reference. One set of primers complementary to a template
   DNA are designed, and a region flanked by the primers is amplified by DNA polymerase in a reaction
20 including multiple amplification cycles. Each amplification cycle includes an initial denaturation, and
   up to 50 cycles of annealing, strand elongation (or extension) and strand separation (denaturation). In
   each cycle of the reaction, the DNA sequence between the primers is copied. Primers can bind to the
   copied DNA as well as the original template sequence, so the total number of copies increases
   exponentially with time. PCR can be performed as according to Whelan, et al, Journal of Clinical
25 Microbiology, 33:556(1995). Various modified PCR methods are available and well known in the
   art. Various modifications such as the "RT-PCR" method, in which DNA is synthesized from RNA
   using a reverse transcriptase before performing PCR; and the "TaqMan PCR" method, in which only
   a specific allele is amplified and detected using a fluorescently labeled TaqMan probe, and Taq DNA
   polymerase, are known to those skilled in the art. RT-PCR and variations thereof have been
30 described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,804,383; 5,407,800; 5,322,770; and 5,310,652, and
   references described therein, which are hereby incorporated by reference; and TaqMan PCR and
   related reagents for use in the method have been described, for example, in U.S .Patent Nos.
   5,210,015; 5,876,930; 5,538,848; 6,030,787; and 6,258,569, which are hereby incorporated by
   reference.
35              LCR is a method of DNA amplification similar to PCR, except that it uses four primers
   instead of two and uses the enzyme ligase to ligate orjoin two segments of DNA. Amplification can
                                                     -114
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   be performed in a thermal cycler (e.g., LCx of Abbott Labs, North Chicago, IL). LCR can be
   performed for example, as according to Moore et al., Journal of Clinical Microbiology 36:1028
   (1998). LCR methods and variations have been described, for example, in European Patent
   Application Publication No. EP0320308, and U.S. Patent No. 5,427,930, each of which is
 5 incorporated herein by reference.
                The TAS method is a method for specifically amplifying a target RNA in which a transcript is
   obtained from a template RNA by a cDNA synthesis step and an RNA transcription step. In the
   cDNA synthesis step, a sequence recognized by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (i.e., a
   polymerase-binding sequence or PBS) is inserted into the cDNA copy downstream of the target or
10 marker sequence to be amplified using a two-domain oligonucleotide primer. In the second step, an
   RNA polymerase is used to synthesize multiple copies of RNA from the cDNA template.
   Amplification using TAS requires only a few cycles because DNA-dependent RNA transcription can
   result in 10-1000 copies for each copy of cDNA template. TAS can be performed according to Kwoh
   et al., PNAS 86:1173 (1989). The TAS method has been described, for example, in International
15 Patent Application Publication No. W01988/010315, which is incorporated herein by reference.
                Transcription mediated amplification (TMA) is a transcription-based isothermal amplification
   reaction that uses RNA transcription by RNA polymerase and DNA transcription by reverse
   transcriptase to produce an RNA amplicon from target nucleic acid. TMA methods are advantageous
   in that they can produce 100 to 1000 copies of amplicon per amplification cycle, as opposed to PCR
20 or LCR methods that produce only 2 copies per cycle. TMA has been described, for example, in U.S.
   Patent No. 5,399,491which is incorporated herein by reference. NASBA is a transcription-based
   method which for specifically amplifying a target RNA from either an RNA or DNA template.
   NASBA is a method used for the continuous amplification of nucleic acids in a single mixture at one
   temperature. A transcript is obtained from a template RNA by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase
25 using a forward primer having a sequence identical to a target RNA and a reverse primer having a
   sequence complementary to the target RNA a on the 3' side and a promoter sequence that recognizes
   T7 RNA polymerase on the 5' side. A transcript is further synthesized using the obtained transcript
   as template. This method can be performed as according to Heim, et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 26:2250
   (1998). The NASBA method has been described in U.S. Patent No. 5,130,238, which is incorporated
30 herein by reference.
                The SDA method is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method in which target DNA is
   amplified using a DNA strand substituted with a strand synthesized by a strand substitution type DNA
   polymerase lacking 5' - >3' exonuclease activity by a single stranded nick generated by a restriction
   enzyme as a template of the next replication. A primer containing a restriction site is annealed to
35 template, and then amplification primers are annealed to 5' adjacent sequences (forming a nick).
   Amplification is initiated at a fixed temperature. Newly synthesized DNA strands are nicked by a
                                                       - 115

   restriction enzyme and the polymerase amplification begins again, displacing the newly synthesized
   strands. SDA can be performed according to Walker, et al., PNAS, 89:392 (1992). SDA methods
   have been described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,455,166 and 5,457,027, each of which are incorporated by
   reference.
 5              The LAMP method is an isothermal amplification method in which a loop is always formed
   at the 3' end of a synthesized DNA, primers are annealed within the loop, and specific amplification
   of the target DNA is performed isothermally. LAMP can be performed according to Nagamine et al.,
   Clinical Chemistry. 47:1742 (2001). LAMP methods have been described in U.S. Patent Nos.
   6,410,278; 6,974,670; and 7,175,985, each of which are incorporated by reference.
10              The ICAN method is anisothermal amplification method in which specific amplification of a
   target DNA is performed isothermally by a strand substitution reaction, a template exchange reaction,
   and a nick introduction reaction, using a chimeric primer including RNA-DNA and DNA polymerase
   having a strand substitution activity and RNase H. ICAN can be performed according to Mukai et al.,
   J. Biochem. 142: 273(2007). The ICAN method has been described in U.S. Patent No. 6,951,722,
15 which is incorporated herein by reference.
                The SMAP (MITANI) method is a method in which a target nucleic acid is continuously
   synthesized under isothermal conditions using a primer set including two kinds of primers and DNA
   or RNA as a template. The first primer included in the primer set includes, in the 3' end region
   thereof, a sequence (Ac') hybridizable with a sequence (A) in the 3' end region of a target nucleic acid
20 sequence as well as, on the 5' side of the above-mentioned sequence (Ac'), a sequence (B')
   hybridizable with a sequence (Bc) complementary to a sequence (B) existing on the 5' side of the
   above-mentioned sequence (A) in the above-mentioned target nucleic acid sequence. The second
   primer includes, in the 3' end region thereof, a sequence (Cc') hybridizable with a sequence (C) in the
   3' end region of a sequence complementary to the above-mentioned target nucleic acid sequence as
25 well as a loopback sequence (D-Dc') including two nucleic acid sequences hybridizable with each
   other on an identical strand on the 5' side of the above-mentioned sequence (Cc'). SMAP can be
   performed according to Mitani et al., Nat. Methods, 4(3): 257 (2007). SMAP methods have been
   described in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2006/0160084, 2007/0190531 and
   2009/0042197, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
30              The amplification reaction can be designed to produce a specific type of amplified product,
   such as nucleic acids that are double stranded; single stranded; double stranded with3' or 5'
   overhangs; or double stranded with chemical ligands on the 5' and 3' ends. The amplified PCR
   product can be detected by: (i) hybridization of the amplified product to magnetic particle bound
   complementary oligonucleotides, where two different oligonucleotides are used that hybridize to the
35 amplified product such thatthe nucleic acid serves as an interparticle tether promoting particle
   agglomeration; (ii) hybridization mediated detection where the DNA of the amplified product must
                                                       -116

   first be denatured; (iii) hybridization mediated detection where the particles hybridize to 5' and 3'
   overhangsof the amplified product; (iv) binding of the particles to the chemical or biochemical
   ligandson the termini of the amplified product, such as streptavidin functionalized particles binding to
   biotin functionalized amplified product.
 5              The systems and methods of the invention can be used to perform real time PCR and provide
   quantitative information about the amount of target nucleic acid present in a sample (see Figure 52
   and Example 18). Methods for conducting quantitative real time PCR are provided in the literature
   (see for example: RT-PCR Protocols. Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 193. Joe O'Connell, ed.
   Totowa, NJ: Humana Press, 2002, 378 pp. ISBN 0-89603-875-0.). Example 18 describes use of the
10 methods of the invention for real time PCR analysis of a whole blood sample.
                The systems and methods of the invention can be used to perform real time PCR directly in
   opaque samples, such as whole blood, using magnetic nanoparticles modified with capture probes and
   magnetic separation. Using real-time PCR allows for the quantification of a target nucleic acid
   without opening the reaction tube after the PCR reaction has commenced.
15              In one approach, biotin or avidin labeled primers can be used to perform real-time PCR.
   These labels would have corresponding binding moieties on the magnetic particles that could have
   very fast binding times. This allows for a double stranded product to be generated and allows for
   much faster particle binding times, decreasing the overall turnaround time. The binding chemistry
   would be reversible, preventing the primers from remaining particle bound. In order to reverse the
20 binding, the sample can be heated or the pH adjusted.
                In another approach, the real-time PCR can be accomplished through the generation of duplex
   DNA with overhangs that can hybridize to the superparamagnetic particles. Additionally, LNA
   and/or fluorinated capture probes may speed up the hybridization times. An exemplary set of capture
   probes useful in this method is set forth in the table below:

                In still another approach, the particles are designed to have a hairpin that buries the binding
   site to the amplicon. Heating the particles to a higher melt temperature would expose the binding site
   of the hairpin to allow binding to the target.

                In another approach, a probe that hybridizes to an amplicon is tethering two (or more)
   particles. The reaction would be conducted in the presence of a polymerase with 5' exonuclease
   activity, resulting in the cleavage of the inter-particle tether and a subsequent change in T2. The
   polymerase is selected to have exonuclease activity and compatibility with the matrix of choice (e.g.
 5 blood). In this approach, smaller particles (e.g., 30 nm CLIO) can be used to reduce steric hindrance
   of the hybridization to target or subsequent enzymatic digestion during polymerization (see, e.g., Heid
   et al Genome Research 1996 6: 986-994).
                In another approach, two particle populations can be synthesized to bear complementary
   capture probes. In the absence of amplicon, the capture probes hybridize promoting particle
10 clustering. Upon generation of amplicon, the amplicon can compete,hybridize, and displace the
   capture probes leadingto particle declustering. The method can be conducted in the presence or
   absence of nanoparticles. The particles free in solution will cluster and decluster due to the
   thermocycling (because, e.g., the Tm can be below 95'C). The Tm of the amplicon binding to one of
   the particle-immobilized capture probes can be designed such that that binding interaction is more
15 favorable than the particle-to-particle binding interaction (by, e.g., engineering point mutations within
   the capture probes to thermodynamically destabilize the duplexes). In this embodiment, the particle
   concentration can be kept at, e.g., low or high levels. Examples of probes and primers useful in such
   a system are set forth in the table below.

                Previous work showed that in some cases the presence of particles in the PCR reaction could
   inhibit PCR. For these inhibitory particles, it is envisioned that the particles could be pulled to the
   side of the tube (or other location within the container) to keep them out of solution during the PCR
   reaction. Methods can be used to release the particles back into suspension to allow them to hybridize
25 to the PCR product and then pull them back out of solution.

 5              A variety of impurities and components of whole blood can be inhibitory to the polymerase
   and primer annealing. These inhibitors can lead to generation of false positives and low sensitivities.
   To reduce the generation of false positives and low sensitivities when amplifying and detecting
   nucleic acids in complex samples, it is desirable to utilize a thermal stable polymerase not inhibited
   by whole blood samples (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,462,475) and include one or more internal PCR
10 assay controls (see Rosenstraus et al. J. Clin Microbiol. 36:191 (1998) and Hoofar et al., J. Clin.
   Microbiol. 42:1863 (2004)). For example, to assure that clinical specimens are successfully amplified
   and detected, the assay can include an internal control nucleic acid that contains primer binding
   regions identical to those of the target sequence. As shown in the examples, the target nucleic acid
   and internal control can be selected such that each has a unique probe binding region that
15 differentiates the internal control from the target nucleic acid. The internal control is, optionally,
   employed in combination with a processing positive control, a processing negative control, and a
   reagent control for the safe and accurate determination and identification of an infecting organism in,
                                                         -  120
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   e.g., a whole blood clinical sample. The internal control can be an inhibition control that is designed
   to co-amplify with the nucleic acid target being detected. Failure of the internal inhibition control to
   be amplified is evidence of a reagent failure or process error. Universal primers can be designed such
   that the target sequence and the internal control sequence are amplified in the same reaction tube.
 5 Thus, using this format, if the target DNA is amplified but the internal control is not it is then
   assumed that the target DNA is present in a proportionally greater amount than the internal control
   and the positive result is valid as the internal control amplification is unnecessary. If, on the other
   hand, neither the internal control nor the target is amplified it is then assumed that inhibition of the
   PCR reaction has occurred and the test for that particular sample is not valid. The assays of the
10 invention can include one or more positive processing controls in which one or more target nucleic
   acids is included in the assay (e.g., each included with one or more cartridges) at 3x to 5x the limit of
   detection. The measured T2 for each of the positive processing controls must be above the pre
   determined threshold indicating the presence of the target nucleic acid. The positive processing
   controls can detect all reagent failures in each step of the process (e.g., lysis, PCR, and T2 detection),
15 and can be used for quality control of the system. The assays of the invention can include one or
   more negative processing controls consisting of a solution free of target nucleic acid (e.g., buffer
   alone). The T2 measurements for the negative processing control should be below the threshold
   indicating a negative result while the T2 measured for the internal control is above the decision
   threshold indicating an internal control positive result. The purpose of the negative control is to
20 detect carry-over contamination and/or reagent contamination. The assays of the invention can
   include one or more reagent controls. The reagent control will detect reagent failures in the PCR
   stage of the reaction (i.e. incomplete transfer of master mix to the PCR tubes). The reagent controls
   can also detect gross failures in reagent transfer prior to T2 detection.
25              Contamination control
                One of the major problems in the use of PCR as an analytical tool is the risk of having new
   reactions contaminated with old, amplified products. Potential sources of contamination include a)
   large numbers of target organisms in clinical specimens that may result in cross-contamination, b)
   plasmid clones derived from organisms that have been previously analyzed and that may be present in
30 larger numbers in the laboratory environment, and c) repeated amplification of the same target
   sequence leading to accumulation of amplification products in the laboratory environment. A
   common source of the accumulation of the PCR amplicon is aerosolization of the product. Typically,
   if uncontrolled aerosolization occurs, the amplicon will contaminate laboratory reagents, equipment,
   and ventilation systems. When this happens, all reactions will be positive, and it is not possible to
35 distinguish between amplified products from the contamination or a true, positive sample. In addition
   to taking precautions to avoid or control this carry-over of old products, it is necessary to include a
                                                      -  121
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   blank reference reaction in every PCR experiment to check for carry-over. In order to be certain that
   all results are reliable, there must be no amplified products after the temperature cycling. A carry
   over contamination will be visible on the agarose gel as faint bands. Furthermore, it is also very
   important to include a positive sample. If, contrary to expectation, the sample is negative, none of the
 5 results can be considered as trustworthy. (see Aslanzadeh et al., Annals of Clin Lab Science, 34:389
   (2004)).
                It is conceivable that the reagents used to prepare the PCR may be contaminated. After the
   amplification a positive sample may contain 250 ng PCR product in 50 pl. This gives a total of 3.9
    1011 copies of a 600 bp double-stranded product. One thousandth of a microliter of this reaction will
10 contain approximately 8 million copies. If a very small and invisible aerosol is formed when the PCR
   vessel is opened, there is a possibility that this aerosol can contain a very large number of amplified
   products. Furthermore, the microscopic droplets in an aerosol are able to float for a long time in the
   air, and if there is turbulence in the room, they can be carried a long way. Considering the fact that
   only one copy is enough to create a false positive reaction, it is obvious that great care must be taken
15 to avoid this carry-over contamination.
                To address the problem of contamination problem, one or more of the following protocols can
   be used:
                (i) Replace all reagents and stock buffers with new chemicals and new water which have
   never been in contact with the areas of sample preparation and PCR analysis.
20              (ii) Physically divide the area of reagent mixing and sample preparation from the area of
   product analysis (Kwok & Higuchi, Nature, 339:237 (1989)).
                (iii) Sample preparation workstations can be cleaned (e.g., with 10% sodium hypochlorite
   solution, followed by removal of the bleach with ethanol). Oxidative breakdown of nucleic acids
   prevents reamplification of impurities in subsequent PCR reactions.
25              (iv) Sterilization of the amplification products ensures that subsequent diagnostic assays are
   not compromised by carryover DNA, and must follow two generally accepted criteria: (a) the PCR
   needs to be exposed to the environment after there has been some form of modification of amplicon,
   and (b) the modification must not interfere with the detection method. For example, UV irradiation
   can effectively remove contaminating DNA (see Rys et al., J. Clin Microbiol. 3:2356 (1993); and
30 Sarker et al., Nature, 343:27 (1990)), but the irradiation of the PCR reagents must take place before
   addition of polymerase, primers, and template DNA. Furthermore, this approach may be inefficient
   because the large numbers of mononucleotides present in the reaction will absorb much of the UV
   light (See Frothingham et al., BioTechniques 13:208 (1992)). UV light sterilization of the
   amplification products uses the property of UV light to induce thymine dimmers and other covalent
35 modifications of the DNA that render the contaminating DNA un-amplifiable. Alternatively,
   incorporation of dUTP into the amplified fragments will also alter the composition of the product so
                                                         - 122
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   that it is different from the template DNA composition (see Longo et al., Gene 93:125 (1990); and
   U.S. Patent Nos. 5,035,996; 7,687,247; and 5,418,149). The enzyme Uracil-N-Glycosylase (UNG) is
   added together with the normal PCR enzyme to the reaction mix. The UNG enzyme will cleave the
   uracil base from DNA strands before amplification, and leave all the old amplified products unable to
 5 act as templates for new amplification, but will not react on unincorporated dUTP or new template.
   This will efficiently remove contaminating PCR products from the reaction after the PCR vessel has
   been closed, and thus no new contamination is possible. However, the use of dUTP in PCR reactions
   to prevent carry-over can cause problems when the products are used in a later hybridization study,
   due to the low capability of uracil to act in hybridization (Carmody et al., Biotechniques 15:692
10 (1993)). dUTP is incorporated instead of dTTP. When a probe rich in T's is amplified with the
   substitution of dTTP for dUTP in the reaction mixture, a later hybridization signal with the probe may
   be eliminated. To avoid the decrease in hybridization signal the probe binding site should be chosen
   with no more than 25% T's, and without stretches of poly-T. Furthermore, the PCR should contain
   equal concentrations of dUTP and dTTP and not only dUTP. In contrast to the decrease in
15 hybridization signal is the increase in product amplification when using dUTP, especially when AT
   rich target sequences are selected. This is probably because the incorporation of dUTP decreases re
   annealing of formed PCR products which would prevent primers from annealing. If this approach is
   used to increase the product yield, the primer binding sites should be selected with a low content of
   T's, since primer annealing also will be inhibited by dUTP incorporation (Carmody et al.,
20 Biotechniques 15:692 (1993)). Heat labile UDG isolated from BMTU 3346 is described in Schmidt
   et al. Biochemica 2:13 (1996) (see also U.S. Patent No. 6,187,575). A uracil-DNA glycosylase gene
   from Psychrobacter sp HJ 147 was described in U.S. Patent No. 7,723,093. Lastly a cod uracil-DNA
   glycosylase was described (U.S. Patent No. 7,037,703).
                (v) DNase digestion after PCR can be used to reduce contamination. A heat labile DNase
25 enzyme was identified that can be used to digest ds DNA to remove any contaminating DNA prior to
   the PCR amplification step of the target DNA. In this case, the ds DNA is digested, the sample is
   heated to inactivate the DNase, and the target sample and PCR reactants are added to the reaction tube
   to carry out the target specific PCR. (see U.S. Patent No. 6,541,204).
                (vi) Sterilization after PCR can be used to reduce contamination. Incorporation of a
30 photochemical reagent (isopsoralen) into the product during amplification will create a difference in
   composition between the template DNA and the amplified PCR products (see Rys et al., J. Clin
   Microbiol. 3:2356 (1993)). Furocoumarin compounds, such as isopsoralen or psoralen, are a class of
   planar tricylcic reagents that are known to intercalate between base pairs of nucleic acids (see U.S.
   Patent No. 5,532,145). Light treatment of the closed PCR vessel will render previously formed PCR

   product are not changed, but the detection capabilities on agarose gel can be decreased due to reduced

   binding of EtBr. Isopsoralen of 25 mg/ml was shown to be ineffective at preventing contamination,
   and at concentrations up to 100mg/ml, isopsoralen may have an inhibitory effect on the PCR reaction
   itself (see U.S. Patent No. 5,221,608). Alternatively, primer hydrolysis can be used to sterilize a
   reaction after amplification. Primer hydrolysis of sterilization of amplification products relies on the
 5 uniquely synthesized chimeric primers that contain one or more ribose linkages at the 3' end. The
   generated amplification products containing those ribose residues are susceptible to alkaline
   hydrolysis at the site of the ribose molecule. The method includes exposure to IM NaOH and
   incubated for 30 minutes to hydrolyze the amplification products at the sites of the incorporated
   ribose. Thus, if there is carryover contamination, the old amplicon has lost its primer site due to the
10 hydrolysis of the ribose molecules and the new amplicon will have the primer binding sites. In
   another approach, addition of hydroxylamine hydrochloride to PCR reaction tubes after amplification
   sterilizes the reaction contents, and is especially effective for short (<100bp) and GC rich
   amplification products. The hydroxylamine preferentially reacts with oxygen atoms in the cytosine
   residues and creates covalent adducts that prevent base-pairing with guanine residues in subsequent
15 reactions. Thus, the modified amplification product are not recognized as amplification targets in
   subsequent PCR reactions.
                (vii) Prevention of carry-over by changing the product composition from the template can
   reduce contamination. In one approach the DNA composition of the PCR product can be different
   from the natural template DNA composition. This altered composition is intended to make the PCR
20 products sensitive to treatment that will not alter the template DNA. The treatment of the closed PCR
   vessel just before amplification should make the contaminating PCR product unable to participate in
   the amplification. Here the modification would have to be innocuous to the detection method. The
   types of modifications that can be useful in distinguishing contaminant amplification product will be
   apparent, but include introduction of a ligand, cross-linking agent, enzyme recognition site, or other
25 cleavable moiety (See U.S. Patent Nos.5,427,929; 5,650,302; 5,876,976; and 6,037,152).
                One or more of the methods described above can be used in conjunction with the methods of
   the invention to reduce the risk of contamination and false positives. Carry-over of old amplified
   PCR products can be a very serious risk in the nucleic acid analysis in the T2 Biosystems diagnostic
   platform. One way to prevent this contamination is to physically divide the PCR working areas.
30 Alternatives to the physical separation of the PCR reaction method include UV irradiation of PCR
   mix and incorporation of reagents into the newly formed PCR product can be used to alter it from the
   template.
                Reaction Kinetics
35              The reaction of magnetic particles and specific analytes to form aggregates can be used to
   produce a diagnostic signal in the assays of the invention. In many instances, incubation of the
                                                        - 124

   reaction mixture for a period of time is sufficient to form the aggregates. The methods, kits,
   cartridges, and devices of the invention can be configured to shorten the amount of time needed to
   capture a particular analyte, or produce aggregates of magnetic particles. While altering the overall
   concentration of magnetic particles would appear to be a simple and direct approach to increasing
 5 aggregation rates, this approach is complicated by (i) nonspecific aggregation that can arise with high
   magnetic particle concentrations, and (ii) the need to produce an observable signal change (i.e.,
   change in relaxation signal) in response to aggregation in the presence of a low concentration of
   analyte. Reaction kinetics can be improved, for example, by mechanically induced aggregation, by
   acoustically induced aggregation, by ultrasonically induced aggregation, by electrostatically induced
10 aggregation, or by trapping the magnetic particles in a portion of the liquid sample.
                Mechanically induced aggregation
                The kinetics of aggregation can be increased by passing the particle/analyte solution through
   a vessal in which there is a narrowing of the path of the fluid flow. The narrowing enhances particle
15 particle interactions.
                Acoustically induced aggregation
                The aggregation of magnetic particles can be accelerated by applying an acoustic standing
   wave to the sample (see Aboobaker et al., Joumal of Environmental Engineering, 129:427 (2003) and
20 U.S. Patent No. 4,523,682). For example, a flow chamber with two transducers at opposite ends can
   be used to generate an acoustic standing wave in the sample that causes the magnetic particles to
   migrate (or be segregated) in a manner that increases the rate of magnetic particle aggregation.
                Ultrasonically induced aggregation
25              The aggregation of magnetic particles can be accelerated by applying an ultrasonic wave to
   the sample (see Masudo et al., Anal. Chem. 73:3467 (2001)). In the presence of a standing plane
   ultrasound wave particles can move to the node of the wave along the ultrasound force gradient. This
   approach can be used to provide a reliable method for assisting the agglomeration reaction.
30              Electrostatically induced aggregation
                The aggregation of magnetic particles can be accelerated by electrostatic interactions.
   Electrostatic separation or movement of the magnetic particles utilizes inherent differences in friction
   charge characteristics, electric conductivity, and dielectric constants. Since the magnetic particles
   will behave differently under the application of an electrostatic field, movement and enhanced
35 collisions can occur. Electrostatic force exertion on the particles can be proportional to the surface
   area available for surface charge, so the nanoparticles will typically move in the presence of the
                                                        - 125

   electrostatic field when coated with varying materials, such as dextran or other large molecular
   coatings, and whether or not the nanoparticle has bound to one of the binding moieties a analyte. The
   nanoparticles must first be charged and the charge could optionally be pulsed. See, for example,
   Sinyagin et al., J. Phys. Chern. B 110:7500 (2006); Kretschmer et al., Langmuir 20:11797 (2004);
 5 Bernard et al., Nanotechnology 18: 235202 (2007); and Costanzo et al., Lab Chip 2005 5:606 (2005).
                Trapping
                The magnetic particles derivatized with a binding moiety can be held in position by an
   external magnetic field while sample containing the corresponding analyte is circulated past the
10 "trapped" magnetic particles allowing for capture and/or concentrate the analyte of interest. The
   capture and/or aggregation can be facilitated by exposure to a magnetic field (i.e., MAA or gMAA) as
   described herein.
                Alternatively, the kinetics of magnetic particle aggregation can be increased by sequestering
   the magnetic particles in a compartment defined by a porous membrane, such as a tea bag, that
15 permits flow of analytes into and out of the compartment. The increase in the local concentration of
   magnetic particles can increase the reaction kinetics between magnetic particles and analytes, and the
   kinetics of aggregation. After mixing the solution and magnetic particles for a predetermined period
   of time, the magnetic particles are released from the compartment and the sample is measured.
                In certain instances, the particles may be pulled to the side or bottom of the assay vessel, or a
20 magnetizable mesh or magnetizable metal foam with appropriate pore size can be present in the
   reaction vessel, creating very high local magnetic gradients. The metal foam generates very high
   local magnetic field gradients over very short distances which can attract the derivatized magnetic
   particles and bring them in contact with the complementary binding partner on the metal foam and
   improve the chances of a specific productive interaction. An advantage of having the mesh/metal
25 foam in the reaction vessel is that the distance each magnetic particle needs to travel to be "trapped"
   or "captured" can be very short, improving assay kinetics. For example, to a reaction tube can be
   added a magnetizable mesh foam having pores of 100 to 1000 microns, a liquid sample, and magnetic
   particles for detecting an analyte in the liquid sample. The reaction tube is exposed to a magnetic
   field to magnetize the mesh. The magnetic particles are then attracted to the magnetized mesh and
30 become trapped within the pores of the mesh. The concentration of the magnetic particles within the
   mesh increases the reaction kinetics between the magnetic particles and the analyte diffusing into and
   out of the mesh (the reaction tube is optionally agitated to expedite the diffusion of analyte onto the
   trapped magnetic particles). The mesh is then demagnetized (e.g., by heating the mesh or exposing
   the mesh to an alternating magnetic field), thereby permitting the release of magnetic particles
35 complexed to analyte. Larger aggregates of magnetic particles can then be formed, completing the
   reaction.
                                                         - 126
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

                In an analogous approach, the kinetics of magnetic particle aggregation can be increased by
   centrifugally pulling the magnetic particles down to the bottom of the sample tube. The increase in
   the local concentration of magnetic particles can increase the aggregation kinetics. To facilitate
   separation by centrifugation the particles are, desirably, greater than about 30 nm in diameter.

                NMR Units
                The systems for carrying out the methods of the invention can include one or more NMR
   units. Figure 1A is a schematic diagram 100 of an NMR system for detection of a signal response of
   a liquid sample to an appropriate RF pulse sequence. A bias magnet 102 establishes a bias magnetic
10 field Bb 104 through a sample 106. The magnetic particles are in a liquid or lyophilized state in the
   cartridge prior to their introduction to a sample well (the term "well" as used herein includes any
   indentation, vessel, container, or support) 108 until introduction of the liquid sample 106 into the well
    108, or the magnetic particles can be added to the sample 106 prior to introduction of the liquid
   sample into the well 108. An RF coil 110 and RF oscillator 112 provides an RF excitation at the
15 Larmor frequency which is a linear function of the bias magnetic field Bb. In one embodiment, the
   RF coil 110 is wrapped around the sample well 108. The excitation RF creates a nonequilibrium
   distribution in the spin of the water protons (or free protons in a non-aqueous solvent). When the RF
   excitation is turned off, the protons "relax" to their original state and emit an RF signal that can be
   used to extract information about the presence and concentration of the analyte. The coil 110 acts as
20 an RF antenna and detects a signal, which based on the applied RF pulse sequence, probes different
   properties of the material, for example a T 2 relaxation. The signal of interest for some cases of the
   technology is the spin-spin relaxation (generally 10-2000 milliseconds) and is called the T 2 relaxation.
   The RF signal from the coil 110 is amplified 114 and processed to determine the T 2 (decay time)
   response to the excitation in the bias field Bb. The well 108 may be a small capillary or other tube
25 with nanoliters to microliters of the sample, including the analyte and an appropriately sized coil
   wound around it (see Figure IB). The coil is typically wrapped around the sample and sized
   according to the sample volume. For example (and without limitation), for a sample having a volume
   of about 10 ml, a solenoid coil about 50 mm in length and 10 to 20 mm in diameter could be used; for
   a sample having a volume of about 40 pl, a solenoid coil about 6 to 7 mm in length and 3.5 to 4 mm
30 in diameter could be used; and for a sample having a volume of about 0.1 nl a solenoid coil about 20
   pm in length and about 10 pm in diameter could be used. Alternatively, the coil may be configured
   as shown in any of Figures 2A-2E about or in proximity to the well. An NMR system may also
   contain multiple RF coils for the detection of multiplexing purposes. In certain embodiments, the RF
   coil has a conical shape with the dimensions 6 mmx6 mmx2mm.
35              Figures 2A-2E illustrate exemplary micro NMR coil (RF coil) designs. Figure 2A shows a
   wound solenoid micro coil 200 about 100 pm in length, however one could envision a coil having
                                                       - 127

   200ptm, 500ptm or up to 1000 ptm in length. Figure 2B shows a "planar" coil 202 (the coil is not truly
   planar, since the coil has finite thickness) about 1000 tm in diameter. Figure 2C shows a MEMS
   solenoid coil 204 defining a volume of about 0.02 tL. Figure 2D shows a schematic of a MEMS
   Helmholz coil 206 configuration, and Figure 2E shows a schematic of a saddle coil 220 configuration.
 5              A wound solenoid micro coil 200 used for traditional NMR detection is described in Seeber et
   al., "Design and testing of high sensitivity micro-receiver coil apparatus for nuclear magnetic
   resonance and imaging," Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. A planar micro coil 202 used for
   traditional NMR detection is described in Massin et al., "High     Q factor RF planar microcoil for
   micro-scale NMR spectroscopy," Sensors and Actuators A 97-98, 280-288 (2002). A Helmholtz coil
10 configuration 206 features a well 208 for holding a sample, a top Si layer 210, a bottom Si layer 212,
   and deposited metal coils 214. An example of a Helmholtz coil configuration 206 used for traditional
   NMR detection is described in Syms et al, "MEMS Helmholz Coils for Magnetic Resonance
   Spectroscopy," Journal of Micromechanics and Micromachining 15 (2005) S1-S9.
                The NMR unit includes a magnet (i.e., a superconducting magnet, an electromagnet, or a
15 permanent magnet). The magnet design can be open or partially closed, ranging from U- or C-shaped
   magnets, to magnets with three and four posts, to fully enclosed magnets with small openings for
   sample placement. The tradeoff is accessibility to the "sweet spot" of the magnet and mechanical
   stability (mechanical stability can be an issue where high field homogeneity is desired). For example,
   the NMR unit can include one or more permanent magnets, cylindrically shaped and made from
20 SmCo, NdFeB, or other low field permanent magnets that provide a magnetic field in the range of
   about 0.5 to about 1.5 T (i.e., suitable SmCo and NdFeB permanent magnets are available from
   Neomax, Osaka, Japan). For purposes of illustration and not limitation, such permanent magnets can
   be a dipole/box permanent magnet (PM) assembly, or a hallbach design (See Demas et al., Concepts
   Magn Reson Part A 34A:48 (2009)). The NMR units can include, without limitation, a permanent
25 magnet of about 0.5T strength with a field homogeneity of about 20-30 ppm and a sweet spot of 40
   paL, centered. This field homogeneity allows a less expensive magnet to be used (less tine fine-tuning
   the assembly/shimming), in a system less prone to fluctuations (e.g. temperature drift, mechanical
   stability over time-practically any impact is much too small to be seen), tolerating movement of
   ferromagnetic or conducting objects in the stray field (these have less of an impact, hence less
30 shielding is needed), without compromising the assay measurements (relaxation measurements and
   correlation measurements do not require a highly homogeneous field).
                The coil configuration may be chosen or adapted for specific implementation of the micro
   NMR-MRS technology, since different coil configurations offer different performance characteristics.
   For example, each of these coil geometries has a different performance and field alignment. The
35 planar coil 202 has an RF field perpendicular to the plane of the coil. The solenoid coil 200 has an
   RF field down the axis of the coil, and the Helmholtz coil 206 has an RF field transverse to the two
                                                      - 128
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   rectangular coils 214. The Helmholtz 206 and saddle coils 220 have transverse fields which would
   allow the placement of the permanent magnet bias field above and below the well. Helmholtz 206
   and saddle coils 220 may be most effective for the chip design, while the solenoid coil 200 may be
   most effective when the sample and MRS magnetic particles are held in a micro tube.
 5              The micro-NMR devices may be fabricated by winding or printing the coils or by
   microelectromechanical system (MEMS) semiconductor fabrication techniques. For example, a
   wound or printed coil/sample well module may be about 100 tm in diameter, or as large as a
   centimeter or more. A MEMS unit or chip (thusly named since it is fabricated in a semiconductor
   process as a die on a wafer) may have a coil that is from about 10 tm to about 1000 tm in
10 characteristic dimension, for example. The wound or printed coil/sample well configuration is
   referenced herein as a module and the MEMS version is referenced herein as a chip. For example, the
   liquid sample 108 may be held in a tube (for example, a capillary, pipette, or micro tube) with the coil
   wound around it, or it may be held in wells on the chip with the RF coil surrounding the well.
   Alternatively, the sample is positioned to flow through a tube, capillary, or cavity in the proximity to
15 the RF coil.
                The basic components of an NMR unit include electrical components, such as a tuned RF
   circuit within a magnetic field, including an MR sensor, receiver and transmitter electronics that could
   be including preamplifiers, amplifiers and protection circuits, data acquisitions components, pulse
   programmer and pulse generator.
20              Systems containing NMR units with RF coils and micro wells containing magnetic particle
   sensors described herein may be designed for detection and/or concentration measurement of specific
   analyte(s) of interest by development of a model for particle aggregation phenomena and by
   development of an RF-NMR signal chain model. For example, experiments can be conducted for
   analyte/magnetic particle systems of interest by characterizing the physics of particle aggregation,
25 including, for example, the effects of affinities, relevant dimensions, and concentrations. Also,
   experiments can be conducted to characterize the NMR signal(s) (T 2, TI, T 2*, T2rho, Tirho and/or other
   signal characteristics, such as T1/T2 hybrid signals and may also include but are not limited to
   diffusion, susceptibility, frequency) as functions of particle aggregation or depletion and magnetic
   particle characteristics. Signal characteristics specific to the MRS (magnetic resonance switch)
30 phenomenon in a given system can be used to enhance detection sensitivity and/or otherwise improve
   performance.
                The NMR system may include a chip with RF coil(s) and electronics micromachined thereon.
   For example, the chip may be surface micromachined, such that structures are built on top of a
   substrate. Where the structures are built on top of the substrate and not inside it, the properties of the
35 substrate are not as important as in bulk micromachining, and expensive silicon wafers used in bulk
   micromachining can be replaced by less expensive materials such as glass or plastic. Alternative
                                                      - 129
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   embodiments, however, may include chips that are bulk micromachined. Surface micromachining
   generally starts with a wafer or other substrate and grows layers on top. These layers are selectively
   etched by photolithography and either a wet etch involving an acid or a dry etch involving an ionized
   gas, or plasma. Dry etching can combine chemical etching with physical etching, or ion
 5 bombardment of the material. Surface micromachining may involve as many layers as is needed.
                In some cases, an inexpensive RF coil maybe integrated into a disposable cartridge and be a
   disposable component. The coil could be placed in a manner that allows electrical contact with
   circuitry on the fixed NMR setup, or the coupling could be made inductively to a circuit.
                Where the relaxation measurement is T2, accuracy and repeatability (precision) will be a
10 function of temperature stability of the sample as relevant to the calibration, the stability of the assay,
   the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), the pulse sequence for refocusing (e.g., CPMG, BIRD, Tango, and the
   like), as well as signal processing factors, such as signal conditioning (e.g., amplification,
   rectification, and/or digitization of the echo signals), time/frequency domain transformation, and
   signal processing algorithms used. Signal-to-noise ratio is a function of the magnetic bias field (Bb),
15 sample volume, filling factor, coil geometry, coil Q-factor, electronics bandwidth, amplifier noise,
   and temperature.
                In order to understand the required precision of the T2 measurement, one should look at a
   response curve of the assay at hand and correlate the desired precision of determining the analyte
   concentration and the precision of the measureable, e.g., T2 for some cases. Then a proper error
20 budget can be formed.
                For example, to obtain a 10-fold improvement in the 0.02 ng/mL detection limit for Troponin
   (10-fold increase in sensitivity), it would be necessary to discern a delta-T 2 less than about 5.6
   milliseconds from a traditional (non-MRS-measured) T2 of about 100 milliseconds. The minimum
   signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) would need to be about 20 to detect this difference.
25              The NMR units for use in the systems and methods of the invention can be those described in
   U.S. Patent No. 7,564,245, incorporated herein by reference.
                The NMR units of the invention can include a small probehead for use in a portable magnetic
   resonance relaxometer as described in PCT Publication No. W009/061481, incorporated herein by
   reference.
30              The systems of the invention can be implantable or partially implantable in a subject. For
   example, the NMR units of the invention can include implantable radiofrequency coils and optionally
   implantable magnets as described in PCT Publication Nos. W009/085214 and W008/057578, each
   of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                The systems of the invention can include a polymeric sample container for reducing, partly or
35 completely, the contribution of the NMR signal associated with the sample container to the nuclear
                                                        - 130

   magnetic resonance parameter of the liquid sample as described in PCT Publication No.
   WO09/045354, incorporated herein by reference.
                The systems of the invention can include a disposable sample holder for use with the MR
   reader that is configured to permit a predetermined number of measurements (i.e., is designed for a
 5 limited number of uses). The disposable sample holder can include none, part, or all, of the elements
   of the RF detection coil (i.e., such that the MR reader lacks a detection coil). For example, the
   disposable sample holder can include a "read" coil for RF detection that is inductively coupled to a
   "pickup" coil present in the MR reader. When the sample container is inside the MR reader it is in
   close proximity to the pickup coil and can be used to measure NMR signal. Alternatively, the
10 disposable sample holder includes an RF coil for RF detection that is electrically connected to the MR
   reader upon insertion of the sample container. Thus, when the sample container is inserted into the
   MR reader the appropriate electrical connection is established to allow for detection. The number of
   uses available to each disposable sample holder can be controlled by disabling a fusable link included
   either in the electrical circuit within the disposable sample holder, or between the disposable sample
15 holder and the MR reader. After the disposable sample holder is used to detect an NMR relaxation in
   a sample, the instrument can be configure to apply excess current to the fusable link, causing the link
   to break and rendering the coil inoperable. Optionally, multiple fusable links could be used, working
   in parallel, each connecting to a pickup on the system, and each broken individually at each use until
   all are broken and the disposable sample holder rendered inoperable.
20
                Cartridge Units
                The systems for carrying out the methods of the invention can include one or more cartridge
   units to provide a convenient method for placing all of the assay reagents and consumables onto the
   system. For example, the system may be customized to perform a specific function, or adapted to
25 perform more than one function, e.g., via changeable cartridge units containing arrays of micro wells
   with customized magnetic particles contained therein. The system can include a replaceable and/or
   interchangeable cartridge containing an array of wells pre-loaded with magnetic particles, and
   designed for detection and/or concentration measurement of a particular analyte. Alternatively, the
   system may be usable with different cartridges, each designed for detection and/or concentration
30 measurements of different analytes, or configured with separate cartridge modules for reagent and
   detection for a given assay. The cartridge may be sized to facilitate insertion into and ejection from a
   housing for the preparation of a liquid sample which is transferred to other units in the system (i.e., a
   magnetic assisted agglomeration unit, or an NMR unit). The cartridge unit itself could potentially
   interface directly with manipulation stations as well as with the MR reader(s). The cartridge unit can
35 be a modular cartridge having an inlet module that can be sterilized independent of the reagent
   module.

                For handling biological samples, such as blood samples, there are numerous competing
   requirements for the cartridge design, including the need for sterility for the inlet module to prevent
   cross contamination and false positive test results, and the need to include reagents in the package
   which cannot be easily sterilized using standard terminal sterilization techniques like irradiation. An
 5 inlet module for sample aliquoting can be designed to interface with uncapped vacutainer tubes, and
   to aliquot two a sample volume that can be used to perform, for example, a candida assay (see Figures
   7D-7F). The vacutainer permits a partial or full fill. The inlet module has two hard plastic parts, that
   get ultrasonically welded together and foil sealed to form a network of channels to allow a flow path
   to form into the first well overflow to the second sample well. A soft vacutainer seal part is used to
10 for a seal with the vacutainer, and includes a port for sample flow, and a venting port. To overcome
   the flow resistance once the vacutainer is loaded and inverted, some hydrostatic pressure is needed.
   Every time sample is removed from a sample well, the well will get replenished by flow from the
   vacutainer.
                A modular cartridge can provide a simple means for cross contamination control during
15 certain assays, including but not limited to distribution of PCR products into multiple detection
   aliquots. In addition, a modular cartridge can be compatible with automated fluid dispensing, and
   provides a way to hold reagents at very small volumes for long periods of time (in excess of a year).
   Finally, pre-dispensing these reagents allows concentration and volumetric accuracy to be set by the
   manufacturing process and provides for a point of care use instrument that is more convenient as it
20 can require much less precise pipetting.
                The modular cartridge of the invention is a cartridge that is separated into modules that can be
   packaged and if necessary sterilized separately. They can also be handled and stored separately, if for
   example the reagent module requires refrigeration but the detection module does not. Figure 6 shows
   a representative cartridge with an inlet module, a reagent module and a detection module that are
25 snapped together. In this embodiment, the inlet module would be packaged separately in a sterile
   package and the reagent and detection modules would be pre-assembled and packaged together.
                During storage, the reagent module could be stored in a refrigerator while the inlet module
   could be stored in dry storage. This provides the additional advantage that only a very small amount
   of refrigerator or freezer space is required to store many assays. At time of use, the operator would
30 retrieve a detection module and open the package, potentially using sterile technique to prevent
   contamination with skin flora if required by the assay. The Vacutainer tube is then decapped and the
   inverted inlet module is placed onto the tube as shown in Figure 7A. This module has been designed
   to be easily moldable using single draw tooling as shown in Figures 7B and 7C and the top and
   bottom of the cartridge are sealed with foil to prevent contamination and also to close the channels.
35 Once the tube has been re-sealed using the inlet module, the assembly is turned right side up and
   snapped onto the remainder of the cartridge. The inlet section includes a well with an overflow that
                                                       - 132
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   allows sample tubes with between 2 and 6ml of blood to be used and still provide a constant depth
   interface to the system automation. It accomplishes this by means of the overflow shown in Figure 8,
   where blood that overflows the sampling well simply falls into the cartridge body, preventing
   contamination.
 5              Figures 9A-9C show the means of storing precisely pipetted small volume reagents. The
   reagents are kept in pipette tips that are shown in Figure 9C. These are filled by manufacturing
   automation and then are placed into the cartridge to seal their tips in tight fitting wells which are
   shown in a cutaway view Figure 9B. Finally, foil seals are placed on the back of the tips to provide a
   complete water vapor proof seal. It is also possible to seal the whole module with a seal that will be
10 removed by the operator, either in place of or in addition to the aforementioned foils. This module
   also provides storage for empty reaction vessels and pipette tips for use by the instrument while the
   detection module provides storage for capped 200 pl PCR vials used by the instrument to make final
   measurements from.
                Figures 10-13C show an alternative embodiment of the detection module of the cartridge
15 which is design to provide for contamination control during, for example, pipetting of post-PCR
   (polymerase chain reaction) products. This is required because the billion fold amplification
   produced by PCR presents a great risk of cross contamination and false positives. However, it is
   desirable to be able to aliquot this mixture safely, because low frequency analytes will have been
   amplified up and can be distributed for separate detection or identification. There are three ways in
20 which this portion of the cartridge aids in contamination control during this aliquoting operation.
                First, the cartridge contains a recessed well to perform the transfer operations in as shown in
   Figures 1OA and 1OB. Second, the machine provides airflow through this well and down into the
   cartridge through holes in the bottom of the well, as shown in Figure 11. The depth of the well is
   such that a pipette tip will remain in the airflow and prevent any aerosol from escaping. Figure 12
25 depicts a bottom view of the detection module, showing the bottom of the detection tubes and the two
   holes used to ensure airflow. An optional filter can be inserted here to capture any liquid aerosol and
   prevent it from entering the machine. This filter could also be a sheet of a hydrophobic material like
   Gore-tex that will allow air but not liquids to escape. Finally, there is a special seal cap on each 200ul
   tube to provide a make then break seal for each pipette tip as it enters the vessel, as shown in Figures
30  13A-13C. It is contemplated that the pipette tip used for aliqouting be stored in this well at all, thus
   making it possible for the tip never to leave the controlled air flow region.
                Alternatively, the modular cartridge is designed for a multiplexed assay. The challenge in
   multiplexing assays is combining multiple assays which have incompatible assay requirements (i.e.,
   different incubation times and/or temperatures) on one cartridge. The cartridge format depicted in
35 Figures 14A- 14C allows for the combination of different assays with dramatically different assay
   requirements. The cartridge features two main components: (i) a reagent module (i.e., the reagent
                                                         - 133
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   strip portion) that contains all of the individual reagents required for the full assay panel, and (ii) the
   detection module. The detection modules contain only the parts of the cartridge that carry through the
   incubation, and can carry single assays or several assays, as needed. The detection module depicted
   in Figure 14B includes two detection chambers for a single assay, the first detection chamber as the
 5 control and the second detection chamber for the sample. This cartridge format is expandable in that
   additional assays can be added by including reagents and an additional detection module.
                The operation of the module begins when the user inserts the entire or a portion of the
   cartridge into the instrument. The instruments performs the assay actuation, aliquoting the assays into
   the separate detection chambers. These individual detection chambers are then disconnected from the
10 reagent strip and from each other, and progress through the system separately. Because the reagent
   module is separated and discarded, the smallest possible sample unit travels through the instrument,
   conserving internal instrument space. By splitting up each assay into its own unit, different
   incubation times and temperatures are possible as each multiplexed assay is physically removed from
   the others and each sample is individually manipulated.
15              The cartridge units of the invention can include one or more populations of magnetic
   particles, either as a liquid suspension or dried magnetic particles which are reconstituted prior to use.
   For example, the cartridge units of the invention can include a compartment including from 1x 106 to
    1xlI1     magnetic particles (e.g., from 1x106 to 1x1O8, lx107 to 1x10 9, lxlO 8 to    ixioo,   lx109 to
                      10
    ixio",        xl       0 to 1x101, lxl 1 " to 1x10, or from   x107 to 5x10 8 magnetic particles) for assaying a
20 single liquid sample.
                MAA Units
                The systems for carrying out the methods of the invention can include one or more magnetic
   assisted agglomeration (MAA) units to expedite agglomeration of the magnetic particles, allowing the
25 assay reactions to reach completion (i.e., a stable reading) more quickly. The methods of the
   invention utilize functionalized magnetic particles to interact with analytes or multivalent binding
   agents (with multiple binding sites). Agglomeration of the magnetic particles alters the spin-spin
   relaxation rate of the sample when exposed to a magnetic field with a subsequent change in T 2
   relaxation time.
30              For example, a field gradient can be used to sweep magnetic particles (MPs) through the
   liquid sample, allowing the magnetic particles to bind to either specific antibody (analyte-coated
   magnetic particles) or analyte (antibody-coated magnetic particles), and then concentrating the
   magnetic particles in a portion of the reaction chamber so as to facilitate particle-particle interactions
   that lead to specific, ligand/analyte induced agglomeration. The magnetic particles can optionally be
35 allowed to diffuse in the absence of a magnetic field, sonicated, vortexed, shaken, or subjected to
   ultrasonic mixing to break apart non-specific magnetic particle interactions and re-distribute the
                                                            - 134
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   magnetic particles back into the liquid sample. The process can be repeated to promote further
   specific agglomeration. This cycling of magnetic particles between being dispersed in the liquid
   sample and then concentrated at the side or bottom of the reaction vessel can be repeated as many
   times as necessary to maximize specific agglomeration, and consequently maximize the assay signal.
 5 The agglomeration state of the magnetic particles can be determined using an NMR relaxation
   measurement.
                The MAA method of the invention can employ a gradient magnetic field in order to promote
   rapid magnetic particle-particle interactions. In one example, analyte coated magnetic particles are
   added to a solution with a multimeric-analyte specific ligand and placed in a gradient magnetic field.
10 The magnetic field causes particles to concentrate on the side or bottom of a reaction vessel (highest
   magnetic field strength) resulting in enhanced particle-particle interaction and subsequent
   aggregation. Aggregation is measured by observing a change in, for example, T 2 signal.
   Improvements of 10 to 1000 percent signal change (e.g., from 10 to 30%, from 20% to 50%, from
   40% to 80%, from 50% to 200%, from 100% to 500%, or from 500% to 1000% signal change) can be
15 observed.
                Traditional homogenous MAA takes advantage of dipole-dipole forces for assisting particle
   particle interactions while particle dipoles are aligned with the magnetic field of the hMAA unit
   throughout the liquid sample. In contrast, gradient MAA rapidly concentrates magnetic particles to a
   locus, thereby greatly facilitating particle-particle interactions.
20              The cycling MAA approach described herein can accelerate the kinetics of magnetic particle
   analyte clustering by (i) reducing the spatial entropy of the binding interaction step by maintaining
   local concentration of the magnetic particles, (ii) introducing localized mixing by magnet mediated
   transportation of the pellet from position to position, (iii) reducing shearing of the specific-bound
   clusters by reducing the need for more energetic dispersion methods, such as vortexing, and/or (iv)
25 changing the magnetic field direction, and thereby causing a local dispersion and re-aggregation of
   magnetically clustered particles as they re-align their dipoles with the new magnetic field direction,
   and allowing the locally dispersed magnetic particles to form specific binding interactions involving
   the target analyte.
                In one example, magnet assemblies producing a magnetic field gradient are placed in two
30 positions relative to the assay tube, one to the side of the tube and one at the bottom of the tube (side
   bottom configuration). Alternatively, the second magnet position can be located on a different side of
   the tube (side-side configuration). The tube then is moved to ensure exposure to one magnet followed
   by exposure to the other magnet (see Figure 15). This has also been observed to produce a similar
   enhancement in clustering.
35              An alternate methodology is to rotate the liquid sample within a gradient magnetic field (or to
   rotate the magnetic field gradient about the sample) to simultaneously effect a re-orientation of
                                                        - 135
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   particles within the pellet (relative to the remainder of the liquid sample) and to sweep the pellet
   through the liquid sample. The rate of rotation can be slow to allow the pellet of magnetic particles to
   largely remain held in proximity to the gradient magnet (rather than moving in concert with the
   solvent and analytes in liquid sample). For example, the rotation is typically slower than 0.0333 Hz
 5 (e.g., from 0.000833 Hz to 0.0333 Hz, from 0.00166 Hz to 0.0333 Hz, or from 0.00333 Hz to 0.0333
   Hz), such that the particles are retained adjacent to the magnetic field source, while the remaining
   contents in the tube are rotated.
                A single gradient magnet can be used, while the sample can be moved around the magnet (or
   use the same location close to the magnet and alternate with a position removed from the field of the
10 single magnet. The magnet could be moved to the proximity or away from the sample.
                The sample can be placed between magnets of the same field orientation for a "field
   averaging" effect in alternating fashion, in order to simplify the fabrication of a gMAA system (i.e.,
   eliminate the need to carefully select magnets that generate same field profiles). For example a
   plurality of such magnets could be placed in a circular setup, and samples rotated via a carousel setup,
15 from the first magnet to a null (small magnetic field exposure) to the second magnet etc. The rotary
   gMAA device can include a fixed baseplate to which an electric motor is attached, with a number of
   magnets mounted around it in a circular pattern. The magnets are spaced such that there is minimal
   magnetic interference between positions. A carousel capable of holding sample vials is attached to
   the motor shaft such that it rotates with the motor, exposing the samples to different magnetic field
20 orientations from one position to the next. Any combination of side-oriented magnets, bottom
   oriented magnets and positions with very low residual field (null) can be used. See Figure 56A.
                In another example, a homogenous field is used to expedite the agglomeration of magnetic
   particles in an assay of the invention. We have observed that hMAA is not as effective as exposure to
   field gradients in terms of concentrating particles and sweeping them through the sample, for
25 timescales relevant to applications. However hMAA has advantages over the field gradient assisted
   agglomeration method. Using hMAA the magnetic particles are not enticed to move towards a
   specific location in the tube (see Figure 16), minimizing non-specific trapping of particles within
   specific cluster fragments. Agitation after hMAA appears to minimize the non-specific binding. The
   hMAA treatment appears to enhance analyte induced clustering by increasing the collision frequency
30 (a possible result of decreasing the particle's position and rotational entropies due to localization in an
   ordered state). The magnetic particles can subsequently be sonicated, vortexed, shaken (i.e., energy
   additions) to break apart any non-specific particle interactions and re-distribute the particles back into
   the sample. Additional mixing or gentle agitation during this process would potentially further
   increase the analyte-specific binding events for enhancement of the overall assay signal. The
35 agglomeration/clustering state of the magnetic particles can be determined by monitoring changes in
   an NMR relaxation rate. It is also possible to rotate the liquid sample within a homogenous magnetic
                                                      - 136

   field (or to rotate a homogenous magnetic field about the sample) to expedite the aggregation of
   magnetic particles in a liquid sample.
                We have observed that longer MAA times leads to increased changes in T2, presumably from
   an increased fraction of clustered particles. We have found that cycled magnetic separation and
 5 resuspension leads to increased changes in T2 and increased clustering. All of these observations
   point towards a system that must be driven to a steady state or completion (e.g., maximally clustered).
                The systems of the invention can include one or more MAA units. For example, the MAA
   unit can be one or more magnets configured to apply a gradient magnetic field in a first direction
   relative to the liquid sample, and, after repositioning the sample chamber, apply a gradient magnetic
10 field in a second direction relative to the liquid sample (see Figure 17). Alternatively, the MAA unit
   can be an array of magnets configured to apply a gradient magnetic field to, e.g., the side of a liquid
   sample, and, after repositioning the sample chamber, to, e.g., the bottom of the liquid sample (see
   Figures 18A-18C). The systems of the invention can include an MAA unit configured to apply a
   homogenous magnetic field to one or more liquid samples (see Figures 19A and 19B).
15
                Agitation Units
                The systems for carrying out the methods of the invention can include one or more agitation
   units to break apart non-specific magnetic particle interactions and re-distribute the magnetic particles
   back into the liquid sample, or to simply agitate the sample tube to completely mix the assay reagents.
20 For example, the agitation units can include a sonication, vortexing, shaking, or ultrasound station for
   mixing one or more liquid samples. Mixing could be achieved by aspiration dispensing or other fluid
   motion (e.g., flow within a channel). Also, mixing could be provided by a vibrating pipette or a
   pipette that moves from side to side within the sample tube.
                The agitation unit can be vortexer or a compact vortexer each of which can be designed to
25 provide a stable motion for the desired sample mixing.
                The vortexer includes the following components: (i) a sample support, (ii) a main plate, (iii)
   four linkages, (iv) linear rail and carriage system (x2), (v) a support for driveshaft and rails, (vi)
   coupling and driveshaft, (vii) a mounting plate, and (viii) a drive motor (see Figure 20).
                The compact vortexer includes the following components: (i) a sample support, (ii) a main
30 plate, (iii) two linkages, (iv) linear rail and carriage system (x1), (v) a support for linear rail, (vi)
   support for driveshaft, (vii) coupling and driveshaft, (viii) a mounting plate, and (ix) a drive motor
   (see Figure 21).
                The basic principle of motion for a vortexer is as follows: the driveshaft including one axis
   coaxial to the motor shaft, and a second that is offset and parallel to the motor shaft. When the motor
35 shaft is attached to the driveshaft (typically through a helical coupling) and rotated, the offset axis of
   the driveshaft is driven in an orbital path. The typical offset is 1%"to produce a vortex in a single 0.2
                                                        - 137
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   mL sample tube, but this can be easily modified to effectively mix different sample volumes in other
   tube geometries.
                Alternatively, the vortexer can be of the type utilizing a planetary belt drive (see Figures 23A
   23C). Figure 23A is an overall view showing the vortexer configured for 1 large tube. Figure 23B is
 5 a section view showing 2 tube holders for small tubes. Figure 23C is an overall view of vortexer
   showing 4 tubes and a close-up of planetary belt drive mechanism.
                The drive motor is typically a servo or stepper with an encoder. These motors have an
   "index" mark that allows the motor to find a specific point in its rotation. These index marks are used
   to home the system, and ensure that the sample can be returned to a known position after mixing.
10 Knowing the exact position of the sample in the vortex station allows theses vortexers to be easily
   accessed by robotic actuators and thus integrated into an automated system. In lieu of index marks,
   sensing devices external could be employed (see Figure 22A). These could be mechanical, magnetic,
   optical or other sensor that is capable of resolving the sample's position at any point along the
   system's path or at a fixed "home" position. In order to access a vortexers or centrifuge via a robotic
15 sample holder/positioned, the system can include using an index mark or external switch to "home"
   the system to a set position after running, using a sensor which tracks the sample motion at all times,
   so that wherever the system stops the robot knows the position, and using a "find" method that
   includes finding a sample after running that would employ a vision system that tracks the sample.
   The guide mechanism is depicted in Figure 22B. The main plate is connected to the offset axis of the
20 drive shaft and is free to rotate. The plate follows the orbital path around and dictated by the motor
   shaft. One end of a linkage is connected to the main plate, and is free to rotate. Therefore in this
   way, the connected linkage is then connected to the orbital rotation of the drive shaft. The other end
   of the linkage is connected to a carriage of the linear rail system and is free to rotate. Thus this end of
   the linkage follows the linear path of the rail. Having two linkages connected to both the carriage and
25 main plate in this way prevents the main plate from rotating around its own center. In the vortexer,
   two linkages are used on two sides of the main plate (4 in total) to balance and stabilize the entire
   system.
                The two vortexers differ because of their use and design requirements. The compact version
   is designed to occupy less space, and requires less durability than this version because it is run at a
30 lower speed, as limited by its smaller motor. For these reasons only two linkages are used to connect
   to a single linear rail system in the compact vortexer. This version needs to be capable of higher
   speeds, and a nearly continuous utilization due to the large throughput capability of this system. For
   these reasons a second carriage and set of linkages is added to balance the system, and increase its
   durability.

                Systems
                The systems for carrying out the methods of the invention can include one or more NMR
   units, MAA units, cartridge units, and agitation units. Such systems may further include other
   components for carrying out an automated assay of the invention, such as a PCR unit for the detection
 5 of oligonucleotides; a centrifuge, a robotic arm for delivery an liquid sample from unit to unit within
   the system; one or more incubation units; a fluid transfer unit (i.e., pipetting device) for combining
   assay reagents and a biological sample to form the liquid sample; a computer with a programmable
   processor for storing data, processing data, and for controlling the activation and deactivation of the
   various units according to a one or more preset protocols; and a cartridge insertion system for
10 delivering pre-filled cartridges to the system, optionally with instructions to the computer identifying
   the reagents and protocol to be used in conjunction with the cartridge. See Figure 42.
                The systems of the invention can provide an effective means for high throughput and real
   time detection of analytes present in a bodily fluid from a subject. The detection methods may be
   used in a wide variety of circumstances including, without limitation, identification and/or
15 quantification of analytes that are associated with specific biological processes, physiological
   conditions, disorders or stages of disorders. As such, the systems have a broad spectrum of utility in,
   for example, drug screening, disease diagnosis, phylogenetic classification, parental and forensic
   identification, disease onset and recurrence, individual response to treatment versus population bases,
   and monitoring of therapy. The subject devices and systems are also particularly useful for advancing
20 preclinical and clinical stage of development of therapeutics, improving patient compliance,
   monitoring ADRs associated with a prescribed drug, developing individualized medicine, outsourcing
   blood testing from the central laboratory to the home or on a prescription basis, and monitoring
   therapeutic agents following regulatory approval. The devices and systems can provide a flexible
   system for personalized medicine. The system of the invention can be changed or interchanged along
25 with a protocol or instructions to a programmable processor of the system to perform a wide variety
   of assays as described herein. The systems of the invention offer many advantages of a laboratory
   setting contained in a desk-top or smaller size automated instrument.
                The systems of the invention can be used to simultaneously assay analytes that are present in
   the same liquid sample over a wide concentration range, and can be used to monitor the rate of change
30 of an analyte concentration and/or or concentration of PD or PK markers over a period of time in a
   single subject, or used for performing trend analysis on the concentration, or markers of PD, or PK,
   whether they are concentrations of drugs or their metabolites. For example, if glucose were the
   analyte of interest, the concentration of glucose in a sample at a given time as well as the rate of
   change of the glucose concentration over a given period of time could be highly useful in predicting
35 and avoiding, for example, hypoglycemic events. Thus, the data generated with the use of the subject

   fluidic devices and systems can be utilized for performing a trend analysis on the concentration of an
   analyte in a subject.
                For example, a patient may be provided with a plurality of cartridge units to be used for
   detecting a variety of analytes at predetermined times. A subject may, for example, use different
 5 cartridge units on different days of the week. In some embodiments the software on the system is
   designed to recognize an identifier on the cartridge instructing the system computer to run a particular
   protocol for running the assay and/or processing the data. The protocols on the system can be
   updated through an external interface, such as an USB drive or an Ethernet connection, or in some
   embodiments the entire protocol can be recorded in the barcode attached to the cartridge. The
10 protocol can be optimized as needed by prompting the user for various inputs (i.e., for changing the
   dilution of the sample, the amount of reagent provided to the liquid sample, altering an incubation
   time or MAA time, or altering the NMR relaxation collection parameters).
                A multiplexed assay can be performed using a variety of system designs. For example, a
   multiplexed assay can performed using any of the following configurations: (i) a spatially-based
15 detection array can be used to direct magnetic particles to a particular region of a tube (i.e., without
   aggregation) and immobilize the particles in different locations according to the particular analyte
   being detected. The immobilized particles are detected by monitoring their local effect on the
   relaxation effect at the site of immobilization. The particles can be spatially separated by gravimetric
   separation in flow (i.e., larger particles settling faster along with a slow flow perpendicular to gravity
20 to provide spatial separation based on particle size with different magnetic particle size populations
   being labeled with different targets). Alternatively, of capture probes can be used to locate magnetic
   particles in a particular region of a tube (i.e., without aggregation) and immobilize the particles in
   different locations (i.e., on a functionalized surface, foam, or gel). Optionally, the array is flow
   through system with multiple coils and magnets, each coil being a separate detector that has the
25 appropriate particles immobilized within it, and the presence of the analyte detected with signal
   changes arising from clustering in the presence of the analyte. Optionally, once the particles are
   spatially separated, each individual analyte in the multiplexed assay can be detected by sliding a coil
   across the sample to read out the now spatially separated particles. (ii) A microfluidic tube where the
   sample is physically split amongst many branches and a separate signal is detected in each branch,
30 each branch configured for detection of a separate analyte in the multiplexed assay. (iii) An array of
   96 wells (or less or more) where each well has its own coil and magnet, and each well is configured
   for detection of a separate analyte in the multiplexed assay. (iv) A sipper or flow through device with
   multiple independently addressable coils inside one magnet or inside multiple mini magnets that can
   be used for sequential readings, each reading being a separate reaction for detection of a separate
35 analyte in the multiplexed assay. (v) A sipper or flow through device with multiple independently
   addressable wells on a plate inside one magnet or inside multiple mini magnets that can be used for
                                                       - 140

   sequential readings using a single sided coil that can be traversed along the plate, each reading being a
   separate reaction for detection of a separate analyte in the multiplexed assay. (vi) A tube containing
   two compartments read simultaneously, resulting in one relaxation curve which is then fit using bi
   exponential fitting to produce the separate readings for the multiplexed array. (vii) A microfluidics
 5 system where each droplet of liquid is moved around individually, to produce readings for the
   multiplexed array. (viii) Sequential measurements using magnetic separation and resuspension
   requires novel binding probes or the ability to turn them on and off This method would be used for
   nucleic acid analytes in which turn on/off mechanism is based mostly on melting temperature (at
   higher temperatures hairpin loops relax, denaturation of double strand binding), and hybridization
10 will occur at different temperatures. (ix) Individual capillaries, each equipped with dried particles
   within them, allow for small volume rapid multiplexing of one small aliquot. The dried particles are
   spatially separated, and this spatial separation permits the MR Reader to read each capillary tube
   independently. (x) Binding moieties conjugated to nanoparticles are placed in a gel or other viscous
   material forming a region and analyte specific viscous solution. The gel or viscous solution enhances
15 spatial separation of more than one analyte in the starting sample because after the sample is allowed
   to interact with the gel, the target analyte can readily diffuse through the gel and specifically bind to a
   conjugated moiety on the gel or viscous solution held nanoparticle. The clustering or aggregation of
   the specific analyte, optionally enhanced via one of the described magnetic assisted agglomeration
   methods, and detection of analyte specific clusters can be performed by using a specific location
20 NMR reader. In this way a spatial array of nanoparticles, and can be designed, for example, as a 2d
   array. (xi) Magnetic particles can be spotted and dried into multiple locations in a tube and then each
   location measured separately. For example, one type of particle can be bound to a surface and a
   second particle suspended in solution, both of which hybridize to the analyte to be detected. Clusters
   can be formed at the surface where hybridization reactions occur, each surface being separately
25 detectable. (xii) A spotted array of nucleic acids can be created within a sample tube, each configured
   to hybridize to a first portion of an array of target nucleic acids. Magnetic particles can be designed
   with probes to hybridize to a second portion of the target nucleic acid. Each location can be measured
   separately. Alternatively, any generic beacon or detection method could be used to produce output
   from the nucleic acid array. (xiii) An array of magnetic particles for detecting an array of targets can
30 be included in a single sample, each configured (e.g., by size, or relaxation properties) to provide a
   distinct NMR relaxation signature with aggregate formation. For example, each of the particles can
   be selected to produce distinct T2 relaxation times (e.g., one set of particles covers 10-200ms, a
   second set from 250 -500 a third set from 550-1100, and so on). Each can be measured as a separate
   band of relaxation rates. (xiv) For detection of analytes of various size or magnetic particles, or
35 aggregates of various size, a single sample with multiple analytes and magnetic particles can undergo
   separation in the presence of a magnetic or electric field (i.e., electrophoretic separation of magnetic
                                                      - 141
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   particles coated with analytes), the separate magnetic particles and/or aggregates reaching the site of a
   detector at different times, accordingly. (xv) The detection tube could be separated into two (or
   more) chambers that each contain a different nanoparticle for detection. The tube could be read using
   the reader and through fitting a multiple exponential curve such as A*exp(T2_1) + B*exp(T2_2), the
 5 response of each analyte could be determined by looking at the relative size of the constants A and B
   and T2_1 and T2_2. (xvi) Gradient magnetic fields can be shimmed to form narrow fields. Shim
   pulses or other RF based Shimming within a specific field can be performed to pulse and receive
   signals within a specific region. In this way one could envision a stratification of the Rf pulse within
   a shim and specific resonance signals could be received from the specific shim. While this method
10 relies on shimming the gradient magnetic field, multiplexing would include then, to rely on one of the
   other methods described to get different nanaoparticles and the clusters to reside in these different
   shims. Thus there would be two dimensions, one provided by magnetic field shims and a second
   dimension provided by varying nanoparticle binding to more than one analyte. Nanoparticles having
   two distinct NMR relaxation signals upon clustering with an analyte may be employed in a
15 multiplexed assay.                 In this methods, the observation that small particles (30-200nm) cause a
   deccrease in T2 with clustering whereaslarge particles (>800nm) cause an increase with clustering.
   The reaction assay is designed as a competitive reaction, so that with the addition of the target it
   changes the equilibrium relaxation signal. For example, if the T2 relaxation time is shorter, clusters
   forming of analyte with small particles are forming. If on the other hand, the T2 relaxation becomes
20 longer, clusters of analyte with larger particles are forming. It's probably useful to change the
   density/viscosity of the solution with additives such as trehalose or glucose or glycerol to make sure
   the big particles stay in solution. One nanoparticle having binding moieties to a specific analyte for
   whose T2 signal is decreased on clustering may be combined with a second nanaoparticle having a
   second binding moiety to a second analyte for whose T2 signal is increased on clustering. In the case
25 for which the sample is suspected to have both analytes and the clustering reaction may cancel each
   other out (the increased clustering cancels the decreased clustering), one could envision an ordering of
   the analysis, i.e. addition of competitive binding agents to detect a competitive binding and thus T2
   signal that would be related to the presence/absence of the analyte of interest in the sample.
   Alternatively, if the increased clustering cancels the decreased clustering in this multiplexing format,
30 one could envision use of different relaxation pulse sequences or relaxation determinants to identify
   the presence/absence or concentration of analyte in the sample. (xvii) Precipitation measurement of
   particles. In this method, multiple types of particles designed to capture different target sequences of
   nucleic acid are designed So that the particle size is small enough that the particles bound with analyte
   remain suspended in solution. Sequential addition of an "initiator" sequence that is complementary to
35 a nucleic acid sequence conjugatged to a second set of particles (a larger particle, not necessarily
   having magnetic properties) and contains a complementary sequence to the captured target DNA
                                                                 - 142
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   sequence. After hybridization, clusters will form if the target DNA sequence is present, e.g. the
   magnetic nanoparticle conjugated with probe anneals to one specific sequence on the target analyte
   and the other particle binds to another sequence on the target nucleic acid sequence. These clusters
   will be big enough to precipitate (this step may require a centrifugation step). In the same reaction,
 5 and simulataneously, one could design an additional magnetic particle, second particle set to anneal
   with a second nucleic acid sequence for which formation of the magnetic nanparticle-analyte-second
   particle clusters do not precipitate. In this way sequential addition of particles can result in
   differential signaling. (xvii) One possible different detection technique includes phase separated
   signals, which would stem from differing RF coil pulse sequences that are optimized for the
10 conjugated nanoparticle-analyte interaction. Optimally, this could be achieved with multiple coils in
   an array that would optimize the ability of the different RF pulses and relaxation signal detection to be
   mapped and differentiated to ascertain the presence/absence of more than one analyte. Multiplexing
   may also employ the unique characteristic of the nanoparticle-analyte clustering reaction and
   subsequent detection of water solvent in the sample, the ability of the clusters to form various
15 "pockets" and these coordinated clusters to have varying porosity. For example, linkers having
   varying length or conformational structures can be employed to conjugate the binding moiety to the
   magnetic nanoparticle. In this way, more than one type of cluster formed in the presence of an
   analyte could be designed having the ability of differing solvent water flow, and thus relaxation signal
   differences, through the aggregated nanoparticle-analyte-nanoparticle formation. In this way, two or
20 more linker/binding moiety designs would then allow for detection of more than one analyte in the
   same sample. (xviii) The methods of the invention can include a fluorinated oil/aqueous mixture for
   capturing particles in an emulsion. In this design one hydrophobic capture particle set and an aqueous
   capture set are used, the hydrophic capture particle set is designed to bind and aggregate more readily
   in an hydrophobic environment, whereas the aqueous capture particle set is designed to bind and
25 aggregate in an aqueous environment. Introduction of an analyte containing sample having specific
   analytes that will bind to either the hydrophic or aqueous particle, and subsequent mixing in the
   detection tube having both hydrophobic and aqueous solvents, binding and clustering would then
   result in a physical separation of analytes to either the aqueous or hydrophobic phase. The relaxation
   signal could be detected in either solution phase. In the event that the analytes and nanoparticles
30 designed in this manner are physically found in an emulsion created by the mixing of the
   hydrophic/aqueous phases, relaxation curves would be distinguishable in the emulsion phase. The
   detection tube may have a capsular design to enhance the ability to move the capsules through an MR
   detector to read out the signal. Further, additional use of a fluorescent tag to read out probe identity
   may be employed, i.e. in the case of two different analytes in the same aqueous or hydrophic phase,
35 the addition of a fluorescent tag can assist determination of the identify of the analyte. This method is
   amenable in samples for which limited isolation or purification of the target analyte away from the
                                                     - 143
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   other material in the sample because the described resonance signals are independent of sample
   quality. Further, the addition of the flurorescent tag can be added in much higher concentrations that
   usually added in typical fluorescent studies because these tags will never interfere with the relaxation
   measurements. In this method, oligonucleotide capture probes that are conjugated to the magnetic
 5 nanoparticles are designed so that specific restriction endonuclease sites are located within the
   annealed section. After hybridization with the sample forming nanoparticle-analyte clusters, a
   relaxation measurement then provides a base signal.       Introduction of a specific restriction
   endonuclease to the detection tube and incubation will result in a specific reduction of the
   nanoparticle/analtye cluster after restriction digestion has occured. After a subsequent relaxation
10 measurement, the pattern of signal and restriction enzyme digestion, one can deduce the target. (xix)
   In a combined method, a magnetic nanoparticle is conjugated with two separate and distinct binding
   moieties, i.e. an oligonucleotide and an antibody. This nanoparticle when incubated with a sample
   having both types of analytes in the sample will form nanoparticle-analyte complexes, and a baseline
   T2 relaxation signal will be detectable. Subsequent addition of a known concentration of one of the
15 analytes can be added to reduce the clustering formed by that specific analyte from the sample. After
   known analyte addition a subsequent T2 relaxation signal is detected and the presence/absence of the
   sample analyte can be surmised. Further, a second analyte can be added to compete with the analyte
   in the sample to form clusters. Again, after a subsequent T2 relaxation signal detection the
   presence/absence of the second sample analyte can be surmised. This can be repeated.
20              Broadly a multiplexed assay employing the methods of this invention can be designed so that
   the use of one non-superparamagnetic nanoparticle to generate clusters with analyte from a sample,
   will reduce the overall Fe2+ in assay detection vessel and will extend the dynamic range so that
   multiple reactions can be measured in the same detection vessel.
                Multiplexing nucleic acid detection can make use of differeing hybridization qualities of the
25 conjugated magnetic nanoparticle and the target nucleic acid analyte. For example, capture probes
   conjugated to magnetic nanoparticles can be designed so that annealing the magnetic nanoparticle to
   the target nucleic acid sequence is different for more than one nucleic acid target sequence. Factors
   for the design of these different probe-target sequences include G-C content (time to form hybrids),
   varying salt concentration, hybridization temperatures, and/or combinations of these factors. This
30 method then would entail allowing various nucleic acid conjugated magnetic nanoparticles to interact
   with a sample suspected of having more than one target nucleic acid analyte. Relaxation times
   detected after various treatments, i.e. heating, addition of salt, hybridization timing, would allow for
   the abilty to surmise which suspected nucleic acid sequence is present or absent in the sample.
                Use complimentary amplicons to block one reaction and allow serial hybridizations. In this
35 method, universal amplification primers are used to amplify more than one specific nucleic acid
   sequence in the stargin sample, forming an amplicon pool. Specific oligonucloetide conjugated to
                                                       - 144

   magnetic nanoparticles are added to the sample and a relaxation measurement is taken. The sample is
   then exposed to a temperature to melt the oligonucleotide-analyte interaction and addition of a
   oligonucleotide that is not attached to a magnetic nanoparticle is added to compete away any analyte
   binding to the magnetic nanoparticle. A second magnetic nanoparticle having a second
 5 oligonucleotide conjugated to it is then added to form clusters with a second specific target nucleic
   acid analyte. Alternatively, the method could have a step prior to the addition of the second magnetic
   nanoparticle that would effectively sequester the first magnetic nanoparticle from the reaction vessel,
   i.e. exposing the reaction vessel to a magnetic field to move the particles to an area that would not be
   available to the second, or subsequent reaction.
10              Each of the multiplexing methods above can employ a step of freezing the sample to slow
   diffusion and clustering time and thus alter the measurement of the relaxation time. Slowing the
   diffusion and clustering of the method may enhance the ability to separate and detect more than one
   relaxation timeEach of the multiplexing methods above can make use of sequential addition of
   conjugated nanoparticles followed by relaxation detection after each addition.        After each sequential
15 addition, the subsequent relaxation baseline becomes the new baseline from the last addition and can
   be used to assist in correlating the relaxation time with presence/absence of the analyte or analyte
   concentration in the sample.
                Hidden capture probes. In this method of multiplexing, oligonulceotides conjugated to the
   magntic nanoparticles are designed so that secondary structure or a complementary probe on the
20 surface of the particle hides or covers the sequence for hybridization initially in the reaction vessel.
   These hidden hybridization sequences are then exposed or revealed in the sample vessel spatially or
   temporally during the assay. For example, as mentioned above, hybridization can be affected by salt,
   temperature and time to hybridize. Thus, in one form of this method, secondary or complementary
   structures on the oligonucleotide probe conjugated to the magnetic nanaoparticle can be reduced or
25 relaxed to then expose or reveal the sequence to hybridize to the target nucleic acid sample. Further,
   secondary structures could be reduced or relaxed using a chemical compound, e.g. DMSO.              Another
   method to selectively reveal or expose a sequence for hybridization of the oligonucleotide conjugated
   nanoparticle with the target analyte is to design stem-loop structures having a site for a restriction
   endonuclease; subsequent digestion with a restriction endonuclease would relax the stem-loop
30 structure and allow for hybridization to occur. Alternatively, a chemical cut of the stem-loop
   structure, releasing one end could make the sequence free to then hybridize to the target nucleic acid
   sequence.
                Where the multiplexed array is configured to detect a target nucleic acid, the assay can
   include a multiplexed PCR to generate different amplicons and then serially detect the different
35 reactions.

                The multiplexed assay optionally includes a logical array in which the targets are set up by
   binary search to reduce the number of assays required (e.g., gram positive or negative leads to
   different species based tests that only would be conducted for one group or the other).
                The systems of the invention can run a variety of assays, regardless of the analyte being
 5 detected from a bodily fluid sample. A protocol dependent on the identity of the cartridge unit being
   used can be stored on the system computer. In some embodiments, the cartridge unit has an identifier
   (ID) that is detected or read by the system computer, or a bar code (1 D or 2D) on a card that then
   supplies assay specific or patient or subject specific information needed to be tracked or accessed with
   the analysis information (e.g., calibration curves, protocols, previous analyte concentrations or levels).
10 Where desired, the cartridge unit identifier is used to select a protocol stored on the system computer,
   or to identify the location of various assay reagents in the cartridge unit. The protocol to be run on the
   system may include instructions to the controller of the system to perform the protocol, including but
   not limited to a particular assay to be run and a detection method to be performed. Once the assay is
   performed by the system, data indicative of an analyte in the biological sample is generated and
15 communicated to a communications assembly, where it can either be transmitted to the external
   device for processing, including without limitation, calculation of the analyte concentration in the
   sample, or processed by the system computer and the result presented on a display readout.
                For example, the identifier may be a bar code identifier with a series of black and white lines,
   which can be read by a bar code reader (or another type of detector) upon insertion of the cartridge
20 unit. Other identifiers could be used, such as a series of alphanumerical values, colors, raised bumps,
   RFID, or any other identifier which can be located on a cartridge unit and be detected or read by the
   system computer. The detector may also be an LED that emits light which can interact with an
   identifier which reflects light and is measured by the system computer to determine the identity of a
   particular cartridge unit. In some embodiments, the system includes a storage or memory device with
25 the cartridge unit or the detector for transmitting information to the system computer.
                Thus, the systems of the invention can include an operating program to carry out different
   assays, and cartridges encoded to: (i) report to the operating program which pre-programmed assay
   was being employed; (ii) report to the operating program the configuration of the cartridges; (iii)
   inform the operating system the order of steps for carrying out the assay; (iv) inform the system which
30 pre-programmed routine to employ; (v) prompt input from the user with respect to certain assay
   variables; (vi) record a patient identification number (the patient identification number can also be
   included on the Vacutainer holding the blood sample); (vii) record certain cartridge information (i.e.,
   lot #, calibration data, assays on the cartridge, analytic data range, expiration date, storage
   requirements, acceptable sample specifics); or (viii) report to the operating program assay upgrades or
35 revisions (i.e., so that newer versions of the assay would occur on cartridge upgrades only and not to
   the larger, more costly system).

                The systems of the invention can include one or more fluid transfer units configured to adhere
   to a robotic arm (see Figures 43A-43C). The fluid transfer unit can be a pipette, such as an air
   displacement, liquid backed, or syringe pipette. For example, a fluid transfer unit can further include
   a motor in communication with a programmable processor of the system computer and the motor can
 5 move the plurality of heads based on a protocol from the programmable processor. Thus, the
   programmable processor of a system can include instructions or commands and can operate a fluid
   transfer unit according to the instructions to transfer liquid samples by either withdrawing (for
   drawing liquid in) or extending (for expelling liquid) a piston into a closed air space. Both the
   volume of air moved and the speed of movement can be precisely controlled, for example, by the
10 programmable processor. Mixing of samples (or reagents) with diluents (or other reagents) can be
   achieved by aspirating components to be mixed into a common tube and then repeatedly aspirating a
   significant fraction of the combined liquid volume up and down into a tip. Dissolution of reagents
   dried into a tube can be done is similar fashion.
                A system can include one or more incubation units for heating the liquid sample and/or for
15 control of the assay temperature. Heat can be used in the incubation step of an assay reaction to
   promote the reaction and shorten the duration necessary for the incubation step. A system can include
   a heating block configured to receive a liquid sample for a predetermined time at a predetermined
   temperature. The heating block can be configured to receive a plurality of samples.
                The system temperature can be carefully regulated. For example, the system includes a
20 casing kept at a predetermined temperature (i.e., 37 C) using stirred temperature controlled air.
   Waste heat from each of the units will exceed what can be passively dissipated by simple enclosure
   by conduction and convection to air. To eliminate waste heat, the system can include two
   compartments separated by an insulated floor. The upper compartment includes those portions of the
   components needed for the manipulation and measurement of the liquid samples, while the lower
25 compartment includes the heat generating elements of the individual units (e.g., the motor for the
   centrifuge, the motors for the agitation units, the electronics for each of the separate units, and the
   heating blocks for the incubation units). The lower floor is then vented and forced air cooling is used
   to carry heat away from the system. See Figures 44A and 44B.
                The MR unit may require more closely controlled temperature (e.g.,  0.1 C), and so may
30 optionally include a separate casing into which air heated at a predetermined temperature is blown.
   The casing can include an opening through which the liquid sample is inserted and removed, and out
   of which the heated air is allowed to escape. See Figures 45A and 45B. Other temperature control
   approaches may also be utilized.

   intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention.
                Example 1. Preparation of coated particles.
 5              Briefly, 1mg of substantially monodisperse carboxylated magnetic particles were washed and
   resuspended in 100 pl of activation buffer, 1OmM MES. 30 pl of 10mg/ml 1OkDa amino-dextran
   (Invitrogen) was added to activation buffer and incubated on a rotator for 5 minutes at room temp.
   For coupling of the carboxyl groups to amines on the dextran, 30 pl of 1Omg/ml 1-Ethyl-3-[3
   dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide Hydrochloride (EDC) was added and incubated on rotator for 2
10 hours at room temperature. Particles were washed away from free dextran 3 x in 1 ml of PBS using
   magnetic separation, then resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. 100 pl of a lOOmM solution of Sulfo-NHS
   biotin (Invitrogen) was used to decorate the amino groups on the dextran surface with biotin. After
   30 minutes of incubation, particles were washed 3x in 1 ml activation buffer. Next, a protein block of
    100 pl of 0.5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) and 30 pl of 10mg/ml EDC was
15 introduced and incubated overnight (Sigma). Prepared particles were washed 3 x in 1 ml PBS and
   resuspended to the desired concentration.
                Prepared particles synthesized with this protocol have been shown to give similar results in T2
   assays for detection of analyte, whether samples include buffer or 20% lysed blood (see Figure 37).
   Variations of the preparations wherein pre-biotinylated amino dextran was conjugated directly to
20 particles in one step have also resulted in similar performance in T2 assays in both blood and buffer
   samples.
                Example 2. Assessment of particles prepared with and without a protein block.
                Briefly, biotin decorated amino-dextran magnetic particles prepared according to the method
25 described in Example 1 were assayed in PBS and in 20% lysed blood samples in an anti-biotin
   titration T 2 assay.
                The assay was performed with the following procedure. 50 tL of matrix, either PBS or 20%
   Lysed blood sample, 50 tL of varying concentrations of Anti-biotin antibody, and 50 tL of 1.0 pag/ml
   secondary antibody were added to a 5 mm NMR Tube. 150 pL of 0.02 mM Fe particles were then
30 added to each tube (i.e., 2.7x 10' particles per tube). The samples were then vortexed for 4 seconds
   and incubated in a 37 'C heat block for 2 minutes. Each sample was then revortexed for 4 seconds,
   and incubated for an additional minute in the 37 'C heat block. Following incubation, each sample
   was placed into a Bruker Minispec for 10 minutes, under a magnetic field. After 10 minutes, the
   sample was removed from the magnet, vortexed for 4 seconds, and incubated in 37 'C heat block for
35 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, each sample was revortexed and incubated in a 37 'C heat block for an

                A T2 values were calculated: T2 - (T2)o,and results are depicted in Figure 37.
                Particles synthesized with a protein block, AXN4, gave nearly equal performance in blood
   and buffer (Figure 37). The graph depicted in Figure 38 compares particles prepared with (open
15 circle) and without (filled circle) a protein blocking step. We have thus found the protein block may
   be needed to achieve similar functionality in blood matrices.
                Additional protein blocks including but not limited to fish skin gelatin have also been
   successful. Particles were prepared according to the method described above, with the exception that
   in lieu of using BSA as the protein block, fish skin gelatin(FSG) was substituted. The graph depicted
20 in Figure 39 shows results of a T2 assay (as described above) using antibody titration for particles
   blocked with BSA and compared to FSG. The data indicates that there is little or no difference
   between the two protein blocking methods (see Figure 39). However, BSA has proven to be a more
   reliable block.
25              Example 3. Determination of amount of dextran coating.
                Attempts to increase dextran coating density on particles have been found to reduce
   functionality of prepared particles in blood. The preparation of particles described in Example 1
   above that demonstrated nearly equivalent buffer/blood performance used a 10x excess of dextran
   base upon a space filling model to determine amount of dextran to include in coating experiments. In
30 an attempt to functionalize particles with a higher fidelity, increasing the dextran coating to a 1000
    10000x excess of dextran in coating experiments generated particles having a thicker dextran coating
   which yielded a reduced response in blood as compared to buffer. We conclude that a moderate
   density of dextran with a protein block may be desirable to produce a particle coating that functions
   well in T2 assays in the presence of blood sample (see Figures 40A and 40B).

                Example 5: Synthesis of antibody decorated particles.
                Amino dextran coated magnetic particles prepared as described in Example 1 can be further
   functionalized with antibodies via an SMCC-SATA linkage (SMCC = succinimidyl 4-[N
   maleimidomethyl]cyclohexane-1 -carboxylate; SATA = N-succinimidyl-S-acetylthioacetate).              The
10 carboxylated magnetic particles are first conjugated to 1OkDa amino dextran via EDC chemistry as
   described above. The dextran coated particles are further modified with an excess of sulfo-SMCC to
   provide a maleimide functional group. Antibodies are modified with a SATA linker, which primarily
   binds to the amines on the antibody. The SATA linkage is controlled to minimize over
   functionalization of the antibody which may lead to cross-linking of the particles or reduced affinity
15 of the antibody. After deacetylation, the SATA linker exposes a thiol functional group which can be
   used to directly attach to the malemide functionalized particles forming a thioether bond. The
   number of antibodies conjugated to each particle can be measured using a BCA protein assay
   (Pierce). Linkers that provide similar functionality to SATA have been used successfully, such as
   SPDP (N-Succinimidyl 3-[2-pyridyldithio]-propionate).
20              Antibody coated magnetic particles can also be prepared using the chemistries described
   above, but with direct covalent linkage to the base carboxylated particle. In some instances it may
   necessary to add additional coating to the particle surface, such as dextran, or a blocking agent.
   Similar chemistries can be used with alternate coatings to the amino dextran, such as PEG or BSA.
25              Example 6. Creatinine assay.
                Briefly, the assay includes the following: a target sample is incubated in the presence of a
   magnetic particle that has been decorated with creatinine, which is linked to the surface of the
   magnetic particles. The creatinine decorated magnetic particles are designed to aggregate in the
   presence of the creatinine antibody. Each of the creatinine decorated magnetic particles and
30 creatinine antibody is added to the liquid sample containing creatinine, which competes with the
   magnetic particles for the creatinine antibody. Thus, the binding of the creatinine to the antibody
   blocks agglomeration of the magnetic particles, and low levels of creatinine are marked by the
   formation of agglomerates. These agglomerates alter the spin-spin relaxation rates of sample when
   exposed to a magnetic field and the change in the T2 relaxation times (measuring a change in the
35 magnetic resonance signal from the surrounding water molecules) can be directly correlated to
   presence and/or concentration of the analyte in the target sample.

               Thirty four stable antibody producing clones were generated. These clones arose from either
   BALB-C (spleen cells) (n= 17) or AJ mice (n= 17). The two genetically different mouse lines were
   selected for the known genetic differences in their immune systems. Criteria and a selection process
10 were developed for screening and identification of an optimal monoclonal antibody for use in the
   assay. The antibody selection process included screening for binding to BSA-creatinine by ELISA,
   antibody affinity/sensitivity/specificity by ELISA competitive assays using free creatinine and
   potential interferents, determination of the ability of the antibody to be conjugated to the magnetic
   particle and functionality in a T2 magnetic relaxation switch assay.
15             Using the established antibody selection criteria outlined above, seven monoclonal antibodies
   were identified and selected as potential candidates in the assay.
               Creatinine-coated magnetic particles
               Substantially monodisperse carboxylated magnetic particles were washed and resuspended in
20 100 1tl    of coupling buffer (50 mM MES, pH      =  4.75). Sulfo-NHS (55 imol in 200 1ilMES buffer)
   was added and the mixture vortexed. To the mixture was added EDC (33.5 imol in 200 1il          MES
   buffer). The solution was briefly vortexed and placed on an end over end mixer for 1 hour at room
   temperature, allowed to settle, and the supernatant removed. To the resulting solids was added 1 mL
   of 1%BSA in PBS, and again the mixture was vortexed and placed on an end over end mixer for 15
25  18 hours at room temperature. The particles were allowed to settle and the supernatant removed.
               The BSA-coated particles were suspended in 0.5 mL PBS-0.01%T20 (10 mM phosphate
   buffer, pH = 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, with 0.01% Tween@ 20). Unreacted carboxyl groups were
   subjected to Methyl-PEG4-amine (20 1tl       of 10% v/v in DMSO) as a blocking agent. The mixture was
   vortexed and placed on an end over end mixer for 8 hours at room temperature. The resulting BSA
30 coated particles were repeatedly washed with 0.5 mL PBS-0.01%T20.

   particles were suspended in 0.5 mL PBS-0.01T20 (pH = 8), followed by the addition of the
   activated COOH-creatinine solution. The resulting mixture was vortexed and placed on an end over
 5 end mixer for 4 hours at room temperature. The resulting particles were washed 3x each with
   sonication using 1:15 and 1:30 DMSO: PBS-0.01%T20 (vol/vol). The particles were then washed 3x
   each with sonication using PBS-0.01%T20. The particles were resuspended in PBS-0.1%T20 (pH              =
   8) and 2 mg of NHS-PEG 2K in 200 pl PBS-0.01%T20 was added. The mixture was placed on an
   end over end mixer for 12-20 hours at room temperature. The particles were then washed 3x each
10 with sonication using PBS-0.01%T20 to produce creatinine-conjugated magnetic particles with
   sequential BSA, creatinine coating, PEG cap and block.
                The creatinine coated particles were resuspended in assay buffer (100 mM glycine (pH = 9.0),
    150 mM NaCl, 1% BSA, 0.05% ProClin@, and 0.05% Tween@).
                The creatinine assay protocol was performed using creatinine conjugated particles and soluble
15 creatinine antibody with detection using the T 2 signal was generated/completed. The creatinine
   competitive assay architecture is depicted in Figure 24.
                Solutions of magnetic particles, antibody, and liquid sample were, where indicated, subject to
   dilution with an assay buffer that included 100mM Tris pH 7.0, 800mM NaCl, 1% BSA, 0.l1%
   Tween@, and 0.05% ProClin@.
20              The creatinine-coated magnetic particles were diluted to 0.4 mM Fe (5.48x 109 particles/ml) in
   assay buffer, vortexed thoroughly, and allowed to equilibrate for 24 hours at 4-8 'C.
                The anti-creatinine mouse monoclonal antibody (described above) was employed as a
   multivalent binding agent for the creatinine-conjugated magnetic particles. The antibody was diluted
   to a concentration of 0.8 pag/ml in assay buffer and vortexed thoroughly.
25              Samples and calibrators were diluted 1 part sample to 3 parts assay buffer. The upper assay
   range is ca. 4 mg/dL creatinine. For samples with expected creatinine levels > 4 mg/dL an additional
   sample dilution was performed using 1 part initial diluted sample to 4 parts assay buffer.
                The pre-diluted sample, assay buffer, magnetic particle, and antibody solutions were each
   vortexed. 10 tL of each solution added to a tube, and the tube was vortexed for 5 seconds.

   software 0.9.14.1/ hardware Version 0.4.13 Build 2, Firmware Version 0.4.13 Build 0) to measure the
   T2 relaxation rate of the sample, and the T 2 relaxation rate of the sample was compared to a standard
   curve (see Figure 25A) to determine the concentration of creatinine in the liquid sample.

                Performance of modified creatinine antibodies
                Different creatinine antibodies were tested in the assay to ascertain the effect of the antibody
   on agglomeration. We observed that the performance of the creatinine antibodies varied in their
   performance characteristics when combined with creatinine-coated magnetic particles (see Figure
 5 25B). SDS-PAGE gel analysis of the two preparations revealed significantly enhanced aggregation in
   preparation 1, believed to arise from an increase in the creatinine binding valency for this antibody,
   which is aggregated due to its purification process. For comparison, we multimerized another
   creatinine monoclonal antibody (14HO3) by biotinylating the antibody and multimerizing the
   antibody in the presence of streptavidin. The monomeric, biotinylated monomeric, and multimerized
10 forms were then tested with creatinine-coated magnetic particles to assess the effect of increased
   valency on T2 time. The results are depicted in Figure 25C, showing the multimerized antibody forms
   clusters at much lower concentrations that the non-multimerized antibodies. This valency
   enhancement for particle clustering has also been observed using IgM antibodies.
15              Example 7. Creatinine antibody-coated magnetic particle.
                Using an alternative assay architecture, the assay includes the following: a target sample is
   incubated in the presence of (i) a magnetic particle that has been decorated with creatinine antibody;
   and (ii) a multivalent binding agent including multiple creatinine conjugates. The magnetic particles
   are designed to aggregate in the presence of the multivalent binding agent, but aggregation is
20 inhibited by competition with creatinine in the liquid sample. Thus, the binding of the creatinine to
   the antibody-coated particle blocks agglomeration of the magnetic particles in the presence of the
   multivalent binding agent, and low levels of creatinine are marked by the formation of agglomerates.
   These agglomerates alter the spin-spin relaxation rates of sample when exposed to a magnetic field
   and the change in the T2 relaxation times (measuring a change in the magnetic resonance signal from
25 the surrounding water molecules) can be directly correlated to presence and/or concentration of the
   analyte in the target sample.
                Substantially monodisperse carboxylated magnetic particles were washed and resuspended in
   300 pl of coupling buffer (50 mM MES, pH = 4.75), and sulfo-NHS (46 pimol) EDC (25 pimol) were
   added to the particles. The solution was briefly vortexed and placed on an end over end mixer for 1
30 hour at room temperature. The activated particles were washed with mL PBS-0.01%T20, and
   resuspended in 1 mL of 10% w/v solution of amine-PEG-amine in PBS-0.01%T20. The mixture was
   vortexed and placed on an end over end mixer for 2 hours at room temperature, and then washed 3 x
   with PBS-0.01%T20.
                BSA can be substituted for amine-PEG-amine as an alternate chemistry. The BSA-coated
35 magnetic particles were prepared as described in example 6, in the section describing creatinine
   coated magnetic particles.

                The particles were resuspended in 260 pl PBS-0.01%T20 and reacted with 198 pl sulfo
   SMCC (5 mg/nL in PBS-0.01%0 T20). The solution was briefly vortexed and placed on an end over
   end mixer for 1 hour at room temperature, and then washed 3x with PBS-0.01%T20 with 10 mM
   EDTA to produce SMCC-coated particles.
 5              SATA-labeled antibody was prepared by combining SATA (30 nmol in DMSO) with
   antibody (2 nmol in PBS, pH = 7.4). The solution was placed on an end over end mixer for 1 hour at
   room temperature. Blocked sulfhydryl groups on SATA-labeled antibody were deprotected by
   treatment with deacetylation buffer (0.5M hydroxylamine hydrochloride in pH 7.4, 1OmM phosphate,
    150 mM sodium chloride, 1OmM EDTA) for 1 hour and purified through a desalting column using
10 PBS containing 10mM EDTA prior to use.
                As an alternate to SATA, SPDP-labeled antibody can be used. SPDP-labeled antibody was
   prepared by adding SPDP (10mmol in DMSO) with antibody (2nmol in PBS, pH 7.4). The solution
   was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and purified through a desalting column. The disulfide
   linkage of SPDP on the SPDP-labeled antibody was cleaved in a reaction with 5mM
15 mercaptoethyamine and incubated for 10 minutes at ambient temperature. The disulfide bond-cleaved
   SPDP-labeled antibody was purified through a desalting column prior to use.
                The SMCC-functionalized particles with PEG- or BSA-coating and deacetylated SATA
   modified antibody were combined and placed on an end over end mixer for overnight at room
   temperature, washed 3 x with PBS-0.05% Tween@ 80, and resuspended in PBS-0.01%T20 with 10

   end mixer for 2 hours, washed 2x with PBS-0.05% Tween@ 80, and resuspended in PBS-0.05%
   Tween@ 80, 1% BSA, and 0.05% ProClin@ to produce antibody-coated magnetic particles.

   and 1OmM EDTA. A blocking agent, m-PEG-SH 2K (lImole), was added, and the solution was

                Creatinine multivalent binding agents
                COOH-creatinine was conjugated to 3 amino-dextran compounds (Invitrogen; MW 10k, 40k,
   and 70kwith 6.5, 12, and 24 amino groups per molecule of dextran respectively) and BSA via EDC
   coupling. The resulting BSA-creatinine and amino-dextran-creatinine multivalent binding agents can
 5 be used in the competitive inhibition assay described above. Degrees of substitution between 2-30
   creatinines per dextran moiety were achieved. An example creatinine inhibition curve is shown in
   Figure 33. The binding agent used is a 40kDa dextran with -10creatinines per dextran molecule.

                Dextran conjugates
                Dextran-tacrolimus conjugates were prepared using three different molecular weight amino
20 dextrans, each with a different amino group substitution.
                2.78 mL of EDC solution (40 mg/mL EDC hydrochloride) and 2.78 mL of sulfo-NHS
   solution (64 mg/mL sulfo-NHS) were combined with stirring. To this mixture was added 0.96 mL of
   tacrolimus-acid derivative (C21) solution (28.8 mg/mL in DMSO) and the contents stirred for 30
   minutes at room temperature to form the activated tacrolimus-acid derivative (activated Tac solution
25 4.6 mM). The activated tacrolimus was used immediately.
                Various amino-dextran polymers were dissolved in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH
   8.0) to make a 9.5 mg/mL stock solution.
                Activated Tac solution was added drop-wise with stirring at room temperature to the stock

                The resulting Tac-dextran conjugates were purified using a 5-step serial dialysis of each

   amino-dextran and a 7K MWCO dialysis membrane for the 40K and 70K amino-dextran).
                Following purification, each of the samples was lyophilized and the dry weight determined.
   The multivalent binding agents were reconstituted prior to use.
                After reconstitution, the tacrolimus substitution ratios were estimated based upon the
10 absorbance at 254nm.
                Experiments were performed to determine which size dextran provided the most optimal
   agglomerative performance. Briefly, 10 pL of 10% MeOH, 1% BSA in PBS pH 6.3 buffer, 20 pL of
   Dextran Tac agglomerator, 10K, 40K, 70K, at varying concentrations, and 10 pL of Anti-Tacrolimus
   coated magnetic particles at 0.2 mM Fe was added to a 200 pL PCR Tube (2.7x10' particles per
15 tube). The sample was vortexed using a plate mixer at 2000 rpm for 2 minutes, preheated for 15
   minutes at 37 'C in an incubation station, exposed to a side and bottom magnet for 1 minute each,
   repeated for 6 cycles, vortexed again for 2 minutes at 2000 rpm, incubated for 5 minutes in 37 'C
   incubator containing PCR tube designed heat block, and the T 2 was read on the MR Reader. Data
   indicates that increased molecular weight/varied substitution ratios of dextran Tac can result in the
20 improved T2 signal (see Figure 34). In addition, higher substitution also resulted in improved
   response (see Figure 35).

   absorbance at 280nm to identify fractions containing BSA.
                The BSA-containing fractions were combined and the acetonitrile removed under vacuum.
                Tac-BSA conjugates were evaluated for clustering ability by performing a titration similar to
   that used for the dextran-tacrolimus conjugates. As observed, clustering performance differs with Tac
15 substitution ratio (see Figure 36).
                Example 9. Tacrolimus competitive assay protocol (antibody on particle architecture).
                A tacrolimus assay was developed using anti-tacrolimus antibody conjugated particles and
   BSA-tacrolimus multivalent binding agent with detection using an MR Reader (see Example 6). This
20 assay was designed for testing whole blood samples that have been extracted to release tacrolimus
   from the red blood cells and binding proteins (the extraction of hydrophobic analyte from a sample
   can be achieved, for example, using the methodology described in U.S. Patent No. 5,135,875). The
   tacrolimus competitive assay architecture is depicted in Figure 28.
                Solutions of magnetic particles and multivalent binding agent were, where indicated, subject
25 to dilution with an assay buffer that included 100 mM Glycine pH 9, 0.05% Tween@ 80, 1% BSA,
    150 mM NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS.
                A base particle with COOH functionality was modified by sequential aminated coating (PEG
   or BSA), antibody covalent attachment, PEG cap and PEG/protein block (as described in the
   examples above). The antibody-coated magnetic particles were diluted to 0.4 mm Fe (5.48x109
30 particles/ml) in assay buffer, and vortexed thoroughly.

                The multivalent binding agent was formed from COOH-modified tacrolimus covalently
   conjugated to BSA (as described in Example 8). The multivalent binding agent was diluted to 0.02
   pg/ml in assay buffer, and vortexed thoroughly.
                The extracted sample solution (10 pL) and the magnetic particle solution (10 pL) were
 5 combined and vortexed for five seconds and incubated at 37 'C for 15 minutes. To this mixture was
   added 20 pL of the multivalent binding agent and the resulting mixture vortexed for five seconds and
   incubated at 37 'C for 5 minutes.
                Several samples were prepared as described above. All samples were placed into the gMAA
   unit for 1 minute. All samples were then placed into a tray removed from the magnetic field. Each
10 sample was vortexed for at least five seconds and returned to the tray. All samples were again placed
   into the gMAA unit for 1 minute, followed by vortexing. This process was repeated twelve times for
   each sample.
                The sample was incubated for 5 minutes at 37 'C, placed in the MR Reader (see Example 6)
   to measure the T 2 relaxation rate of the sample, and the T 2 relaxation rate of the sample was compared
15 to a standard curve (see Figure 29) to determine the concentration of tracrolimus in the liquid sample.
                Tacrolimus antibody
                Several antibody development programs were pursued to create a high-affinity tacrolimus
   antibody including traditional mouse monoclonal models, in vitro phage display strategies, and rabbit
20 models. C21 derivatives of tacrolimus were used as the haptens for the immunogen and screening
   conjugates used in these programs. A set of criteria was developed for screening and identification of
   an optimal antibody for use in the assay. The criteria include the ability to bind tacrolimus-protein
   conjugates, the inhibition of that binding in the presence of nanomolar levels of free tacrolimus, all
   while exhibiting little or no affinity for the metabolites of tacrolimus (depicted below).
25              Using the established antibody selection criteria outlined above, several monoclonal
   antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, and Fab fragments have been identified and selected as potential
   candidates in a tacrolimus assay.

                Example 11. Side-bottom gradient magnetic assisted agglomeration (gMAA).
                An evaluation of "side-bottom" gMAA was performed using the creatinine basic
   immunoassay described in Example 6. For this evaluation, creatinine antibody was diluted to 1 pag/ml
 5 and serum calibrators were diluted 1:5 prior to the assay. 10 pl of diluted calibrator, 10 tL of particle
   reagent and 20 tL of antibody reagent were pipetted into the reaction well. The tube was preheated to
   37C for 5 minutes and then processed through gMAA with a 60 sec exposure in the side magnet,
   followed by 60 see in the bottom magnet. This was completed for 6 total cycles or 12 minutes total.
   A final mix using a vortex for 60 see was performed prior to the reading operation.
10              A standard curve for the competitive creatinine creatinine assay with alternating side-bottom
   gMAA is shown in Figure 27 demonstrating good response with the side-bottom gMAA
   configuration.
                Example 12. Effect of varying the gMAA dwell time and temperature.
15              An evaluation of gMAA dwell time and temperature on assisted agglomeration was
   performed.
                The following conditions were tested to determine the most optimal temperature and dwell
   time for T2 performance: Alterations - 6, 12, 24, 48; for each number of alterations the following
   dwell time was evaluated: 30, 60, 120 seconds. A fixed magnet time of 6 minutes with the following
20 dwell times was also evaluated: 30, 60, 120 seconds. Samples were prepared by adding 20 tL of
   varied concentrations of Protein A (a target protein) and 20 tL Anti-Protein A antibody coated
   magnetic particles at 0.08 mM Fe to a PCR Tube (1.2x 109 particles per tube). Samples were placed
   into a 32 position tray, vortexed in a plate shaker for 2 minutes at 2000 rpm and incubated in a 37 'C
   incubation station for 15 minutes. Samples were then exposed to the aforementioned dwell and
25 alteration conditions between alternating magnetic fields. Following gMAA treatment, samples were
   vortexed manually for 5 minutes, incubated in a 37 'C heat block compatible with PCR Tubes, and
   the T 2 was read using the MR Reader (see Example 6). Data in Figures 30A and 30B show that T 2
   response is directly proportional to temperature and dwell time. Therefore, increased temperature and
   dwell time/total time results in improved T 2 response.

                An evaluation of varying the number of gMAA cycles was performed using the system and
   procedure of Example 12.
                The following conditions were tested for effect on T 2 performance: cycles - 3, 6, 12, 24; for
35 each cycle the following dwell time were evaluated: 30, 60, 120 seconds. A cycle consists of dwell in
   the side, followed by bottom. 6 cycles = 12 total alterations. Samples were prepared as described in

   Example 12. As shown in Figure 31, the degree of aggregation is directly proportional to number of
   gMAA cycles. It was also found that when magnet exposure time reaches or exceeds 24 minutes,
   there is an increase in non-specific aggregation that cannot be dispersed with vortex (not shown here).
 5              Example 14. Candida assay.
                In the assay used for Candida, two pools of magnetic particles are used for detection of each
   Candida species. In the first pool, a species specific Candida capture oligonucleotide probe is
   conjugated to the magnetic particles. In the second pool, an additional species-specific capture
   oligonucleotide probe is conjugated to the magnetic particles. Upon hybridization, the two particles
10 will hybridize to two distinct species-specific sequences within the sense strand of the target nucleic
   acid, separated by approximately 10 to 100 nucleotides. (Alternatively, the two capture
   oligonucleotides can be conjugated to a single pool of particles, resulting in individual particles
   having specificity for both the first and second regions). The oligonucleotide-decorated magnetic
   particles are designed to aggregate in the presence of nucleic acid molecules from a particular species
15 of Candida. Thus, unlike the inhibition assays used for creatinine and tacrolimus, the Candida assay
   features an increase in agglomeration in the presence of the target Candida nucleic acid molecules.
   The hybridization-mediated agglomerative assay architecture is depicted in Figure 32.
                Carboxylated magnetic particles are used in the Candida assays. Magnetic particles were
   conjugated to oligonucleotide capture probes to create oligonucleotide-particle conjugates. For each
20 target amplicon, two populations of oligonucleotide-particle conjugates were prepared.
   Oligonucleotide-particle conjugates were prepared using standard EDC chemistry between aminated
   oligonucleotides and carboxylated particles, or, optionally, by coupling biotin-TEG modified
   oligonucleotides to streptavidin particles. Coupling reactions were typically performed at a particle
   concentration of 1% solids.
25              Post-conjugation, functional oligonucleotide densities were measured by hybridizing Cy5
   labeled complements to the particles, washing the particles three times to remove non-hybridized
   oligo; and eluting by heating to 95 'C for 5 minutes. The amount of Cy5 labeled oligonucleotide was
   quantified via fluorescence spectroscopy.
                The coupling reactions were performed at 37 'C overnight with continuous mixing using a
30 rocker or roller. The resulting particle conjugates were washed twice with 1x reaction volume of
   Millipore water; twice with 1x reaction volume of 0.1 M Imidazole (pH 6.0) at 37 'C for 5 minutes;
   three times with 1x reaction volume of 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate at 37 'C for 5 minutes; then twice
   with 1x reaction volume of 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate at 65 'C for 30 minutes. The resulting particle
   conjugates were stored at 1 % solids in TE (pH 8), 0. 1% Tween@20).
35              The panel of Candida species detected includes C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C.
   tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis. The sequences are amplified using universal primers recognizing

   highly conserved sequence within the genus Candida. The capture oligonucleotides were designed to
   recognize and hybridize to species-specific regions within the amplicon.
                An aliquot of a blood sample was first subjected to lysis as follows:
                (i) A whole blood sample was mixed with an excess (1.25x, 1.5x, or 2x) volume of
 5 ammonium chloride hypotonic lysis solution. Addition of lysis solution disrupts all RBCs, but does
   not disrupt WBC, yeast, or bacteria cells. The cellular matter was centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 5
   minutes and lysate was removed. Intact cells were reconstituted with 100 pl TE (tris EDTA, pH = 8)
   to a final volume of about 100 pal; and
                (ii) To the approximately 100 pl sample, 120 mg of 0.5 mm beads were added. The sample
10 was agitated for 3 minutes at about 3K rpm, thereby forming a lysate.
                An aliquot of ca. 50 pl of lysate was then subjected to PCR amplification by addition of the
   lysate to a PCR master mix including nucleotides; buffer (5mM (NH 4)SO 4,3.5 mM MgCl 2 , 6%
   glycerol, 60mM Tricine, pH = 8.7 at 25 'C; primers (forward primer in 4x excess (300mM forward;
   0.75mM reverse) to allow for asymmetric single strand production in the final product); and
15 thermostable polymerase (HemoKlenTaq (New England Biolabs)). After an initial incubation at 95
   'C for 3 minutes, the mixture is subjected to PCR cycles: 62'C annealing; 68'C elongation; 95'C- for
   40 cycles. Note: there is a 6'C difference in the annealing and elongation temperatures; the annealing
   and elongation may be combined into a single step to reduce the total amplification turn-around time.
                The PCR amplicon, now ready for detection, is combined with two populations of particles in
20 a sandwich assay.

   detivatized magnetic particles. A 1cm square piece of nickel metal foam (Recemat RCM-Ni
   4753.016) was washed by incubating at room temperature for 1 hr in 2M HCL, rinsed thoroughly in
15 deionized water, and dried at 100 'C for 2 hours. The nickel foam was then treated with 2% 3
   aminopropyltriethoxysilane in acetone at room temp overnight. The nickel metal foam was then
   washed extensively with deionized water and dried for 2 hours at 100 'C. The aminosilane-treated
   nickel metal foam was treated with 2% gluteraldehyde in water for 2 hours at room temp and washed
   extensively with deionized water. Next, the metal foam was exposed to 100pig/ml of anti-creatinine
20 antibody (14H03) (see Example 6) in PBS overnight, washed extensively with PBS, and treated with
                                                          - 164

   Surmodics Stabilguard to stabilize and block non-specific binding. Two mm square pieces of the
   derivatized metal foam were cut using a fresh razor blade being careful not to damage the foam
   structure. A piece of the derivatized metal foam was place into a PCR tube in 20 pl assay buffer(100
   mM glycine (pH = 9.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1%BSA, 0.05% ProClin@, and 0.05% Tween@). Twenty
 5 microliters of control particles (that should not bind to the metal foam ABX1-1 1) at 0.2mMFe were
   added to the tube to bring the final volume to 40ul and final particle concentration to 0. 1mM Fe
   (Ix 106     -  1x 10' particles/tube). A separate PCR tube with the exact particle and buffer, without the
   metal foam was also prepared. The PCR tube containing the derivatized metal foam and control
   particles was placed in a gMAA fixture (side pull 6 position) for one minute and removed touched
10 with a hand demagnetizer, and placed back into the gMAA fixture for another minute, removed
   touched with a hand demagnetizer and placed back into the gMAA fixture for another minute and
   vortexed (three 1 minute magnetic exposures). Thirty pl of sample was removed from both PCR
   tubes, heated to 37 'C in a grant block heater for 5 minutes and the T2 read using the MR Reader (see
   Example 6). The T2 from the sample with no foam read 39.2, and the samples from the PCR tube
15 containing the foam read 45.1, demonstrating a low level of particle depletion due to NSB. The
   derivatized metal foam was de-magnetized, vortexed and rinsed in assay buffer. It was placed in a
   new PCR tube with 20 pl of assay buffer and 20 pl of AACr2-3-4 particles derivatized with creatinine
   with a final particle concentration of 0.1 mMFe. A duplicate PCR tube without the derivatized metal
   foam was also set up as in the control experiment. The PCR tube with the metal foam was cycled
20 twice through the gMAA device exactly as the control experiment (3 one minute exposures with
   demag after each exposure, and final vortex). Thirtly pl samples from both tubes were removed and
   heated to 37 'C for 5 minutes and then read on the MR reader. The sample from the PCR tube with
   the derivatized metal foam read 41.5, and the sample from the PCR tube with the metal foam
   derivatized with the anti-creatinine antibody read 324.2, thus demonstrating specific
25 binding/depletion of the appropriate creatinine-derivatized magnetic particles from the aqueous
   volume read by the MR reader.
                 Example 16. Detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms.
                 There are numerous methods by which T2 measurements could detect single nucleotide
30 polymorphisms.
                 The simplest application would involve discrimination of mismatches via a thermophilic
   DNA ligase (Tth ligase). This assay would require lysis of the sample material followed by DNA
   shearing. Adaptors could be ligated onto the sheared DNA if a universal amplification of the genomic
   DNA was needed. The SNP would be detected by engineering superparamagnetic particle bound
35 capture probes which flank the SNP such that the 5' end of the 3' aminated capture probe would be
   perfectly complementary to one particular SNP allele and subsequent treatment with Tth ligase would
                                                        - 165
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   result in the ligation of the two particle-bound capture probes. Ligation would therefore lock the
   particles into an agglomerated state. Repeated melt, hybridization cycles will result in signal
   amplification in cases where genomic DNA amplification is not desired because of the amplification
   bias risk. The same 5'aminated capture probe could be utilized in all case while the 3' aminated
 5 probe could be generated to yield 4 distinct pools (an A, G, C, or T) at the extreme 5' end. Detection
   would require splitting of the sample into the 4 pools to determine which nucleotide(s) were present at
   the polymorphic site within that particular individual. For example a strong T2 switch in the G
   detection tube only would indicate the individual were homozygous for G at that particular sequence
   location, while a switch at G and A would indicate the individual is a heterozygote for G and A at
10 that particular SNP site. The advantage of this method is Tth polymerase has been demonstrated to
   have superior discrimination capability even discriminating G-T mismatches (a particular permissive
   mismatch and also the most common) 1:200 fold against the correct complement. While ligase
   detection reactions as well as oligonucleotide ligase assays have been employed in the past to define
   nucleotide sequences at known polymorphic sites, all required amplification either before or after
15 ligation; in this particular example the signal could be amplified via a ligation induced increase in the
   size of the resulting agglomerated particle complex and thereby increases in the measured relaxation
   times (T 2).
                A modification to this procedure could include hybridization of a particle bound capture
   probe flanking the hybridization of a biotinylated probe. When a perfectly complementary duplex is
20 formed via hybridization of the particle bound probe, the ligase would covalently bind the biotin
   probe to the magnetic particle. Again repeated rounds of heat denaturation followed by annealing and
   ligation should yield a high proportion of long biotinylated oligos on the magnetic particle surface. A
   wash to remove any free probe would be conducted followed by the addition of a second streptavidin
   labeled superparamagnetic particle. Agglomeration would ensue only if the biotinylated probes were
25 ligated onto the surface of first particle.
                A hybridization discrimination approach could as well be employed. In this example,
   aminated oligonucleotide complements adjacent to known SNPs would be generated. These aminated
   oligonucleotides would be used to derivatize the surface of a 96-well plate with 1 SNP detection
   reaction conducted per well. Genomic DNA would then be sheared, ligated to adaptors, and
30 asymmetrically amplified. This amplified genomic DNA would then be applied to the array as well
   as a short biotinylated SNP detecting probe. The amplified genomic DNA would hybridize to the
   well-bound capture probe and the SNP detecting probe would then bind to the tethered genomic
   DNA. Washing would be conducted to remove free SNP-detecting probe. A streptavidin (SA)
   magnetic particle would then be added to each well. Washing again would be required to remove
35 free-SA particles. T2 detection could be conducted directly within the wells by added biotinylated
   superparamagnetic particles to yield surface tethered agglomerated particles, or the SA magnetic
                                                       - 166
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   particles could be eluted from each well on the array and incubated in detection reactions with
   biotinylated magnetic particles.
                Lastly a primer extension reaction could be coupled to T2 detection to discriminate which
   nucleotide is present at a polymorphic site. In this assay, a pool of dideoxynucleotides would be
 5 employed with one nucleotide per pool possessing a biotin (i.e., ddA, ddT, ddbiotin-C, and/or ddG).
   A superparamagnetic particle bearing a capture probe whose last base upon hybridization lies adjacent
   to a SNP would be employed.
                The sheared genomic DNA would be split and incubated in four separate primer extension
   reactions. An exo- DNA polymerase would then catalyze the addition of a dideoxy complementary to
10 the nucleotide present in the SNP. Again this reaction could be cycled if a thermophilic polymerase is
   employed to ensure that most of the capture probes on the particle will be extended. A magnetic
   separation followed by a wash of the particles would be conducted followed by incubation with
   streptavidin superparamagnetic particles. Clustering would ensue proportional to the extent of
   biotinylated capture probe on the surface of the first particle. If two of the dideoxypools generated a
15 gain in T2 (i.e., facilitate particle agglomeration), the patient would be a heterozygote. If only one
   pool yielded and increase in T2, the patient would be a homozygote.
                A final method to detect SNPs employs allele-specific PCR primers, in which the 3' end of
   the primer encompasses the SNP. Since stringent amplification conditions are employed, if the target
   sequence is not perfectly complementary to the primer, PCR amplification will be compromised with
20 little or no product generated. In general, multiple forward primers would be designed (one perfectly
   complementary to each allele) along with a single reverse primer. The amplicon would be detected
   using two or more capture probe bound superparamagnetic particles to induce hybridization based
   agglomeration reactions. One advantage of this approach is that it leverages some of the work already
   conducted at T2 on PCR within crude samples, and would merely entail primers designed to
25 encompass known SNPs. A disadvantage in this approach is that it cannot determine de novo SNP
   locations.
                An additional method which can be used is simply relying on the discrimination capabilities
   of particle-particle cross-linking due to hybridization to a short nucleic acid target. Mismatches in
   base pairs for oligonucleotides have been shown to dramatically shift the agglomeration state of
30 particles, and the measured T2 signal, due to reduced hybridization efficiencies from the presence of a
   single base mismatch.

                Particle hybridization master mix: A master mix consisting of nanoparticle conjugates, salts,
   surfactant, and formamide was prepared (78 piL formamide, 78 piL 20x SSC, 88.3 piL 1xTE +
   0.10%Tween, 7.5 tL CP 1 - 3', and 8.2 tL CP 3 - 5') immediately before use.

                PCR protocol:
                A general scheme of the workflow for detection of a pathogen (e.g., Candida) in a whole
   blood sample is shown in Figure 47. The protocol was as follows: (i) human whole blood spiked
30 samples were allowed to warm to room temperature (-30 minutes); (ii) 1 mL of erythrocyte lysis
   buffer was aliquotted into each tube; (iii) each tube was centrifuged at 9000 g for 5 minutes and the
   lysed blood discarded; (iv) 100 tL of 0.2 micron filtered TE was aliquotted into each tube; (v) 120
   mg of acid washed glass beads were added to each tube; (vi) each tube was vortexed for 3 minutes at
   maximum speed (-3000 rpm); (vii) 50 piL of lysed sample was aliquotted into a tube containing PCR
35 master mix (viii) cycle PCR reactions as follows: (initial denaturation: 95 0C, 3 minutes; 30-40 cycles
   at 95 0C, 20 seconds; 30-40 cycles at 62 0C, 30 seconds; 30-40 cycles at 68 0 C, 20 seconds; final

   extension: 68 'C, 10 minutes; final soak: 4C); (ix) each of the samples was briefly centrifuged after
   thermocycling to form pellet clotted blood; (x) 5 piL of particle master mix was aliquotted into the
   tube for every 10 tL of amplified sample; (xi) the resulting mixture was well mixed and the sample
   denatured at 95 'C for 3 minutes; (xii) the sample was hybridized at 60 'C for 1 hour with gentle
 5 agitation; (xiii) the sample was then diluted to 150 uL with particle dilution buffer, and equilibrated to
   37 0 C in a heat block for 1 minute; and (xiv) the T 2 of the sample was measured using a T 2 MR reader.
                Test Results
                Repeatability of Candida albicans detection in human whole blood: To determine the
   repeatability of the T 2 measurement on C. albicans infected human whole blood, we conducted an
10 eight day study in which the same donor spiked and amplified sample was hybridized to the
   superparamagnetic particles (n=3) each day and the resulting T 2 values were recorded.
                The within run precision is shown in Figure 46A and in general is tight with the CV's of all
   measurands less than 12%. The repeatability observed over the course of eight days is shown in
   Figure 46B with the CVs less than 10% across the range of Candida concentrations and 6% for the
15 negative control. Importantly, a two population two-tailed Student's T-test was applied to determine
   if the difference in means between the mock Candida infected blood at 10 cells/mL and the healthy
   donor blood was significant. The results are summarized in Table 9.
           Table 9. The difference in means between 1Ocells/mL infected blood and negative control is

                Influence of sample matrix on Candida albicans and Candida krusei detection and
   reproducibility: Healthy blood from 6 donors was spiked with a range of C. albicans or C. krusei
   cells (IE5 cells/mL to 0 cells/mL). From the Candida albicans spiked blood, sixteen independent
25 experiments were conducted. Each experiment consisted of PCR amplification of the IE5 to 0
   cells/mL spiked blood with each amplification reaction subjected to three replicate T 2 detection
   experiments; thus for C. albicans a total of 48 T 2 values were recorded at each tested concentration
   (see Figure 48A). At the lowest test concentration (10 cells/mL), we failed to detect Candida albicans
   37% of the time (6 out of 16 experiments); however at 100 cells/mL Candida albicans was detected
                                                                  - 169

    100% of the time. This suggests the LOD for C. albicans is above 10 cells/mL but below 100
   cells/mL. More concentrations will be tested between the 10 CFU to 100 cells/mL to better define the
   LOD; however we do not expect to observe any major matrix effects on assay performance. This is
   evidenced by the CVs of the T2 measurements which are as follows: 12.6% at 1E5 cells/mL in 6
 5 donor bloods, 13.7% at 1E4 cells/mL, 15% at 1E3 cells/mL, 18% at 1E2 cells/mL, and 6% at 0
   cells/mL. This suggests the assay can robustly detect at C. albicans concentrations greater than or
   equal to 100 cells/mL with no major inhibition of performance introduced through the donor blood
   samples.
                The same experiment was conducted using a reference strain of C. krusei. In this case 7
10 independent experiments were conducted as the remaining spiked blood was reserved for blood
   culture analysis. We did not detect at 10 cells/mL in any of the experimental runs but detected at 100
   cells/mL for all experimental runs. This suggests the LOD between 10 and 100 cells/mL. Again a
   titration of cell concentrations between 100 and 10 cells/mL will need to be conducted to better define
   the LOD. The CV's of the measurements across the range of concentrations was: 10.5% at 1E5, 9%
15 at 1E4, 12% at 1E3, 20% at 1E2, 6.4% at 10, and 5.2% at 0 cells/mL. The results are shown in Figure
   48B.
                Preliminary determination of limit of detection: Five Candida albicans clinical isolates were
   spiked into 6 different donor blood samples at concentrations of 1E4, 1E3, 5E2, 1E2, 50, 10, 5, and 0
   cells/mL. Each isolate was spiked into a minimum of two different donor blood samples.
20 Amplification reactions were detected via T2 measurement with the results plotted in Figure 49. It is
   important to note that no data was removed for cause within this study. We did not detect C. albicans
   50% of the time at 5 cells/mL or 10 cells/mL; however at 50 cells/mL C. albicans was detected 95%
   of the time. These data were generated using different clinical isolates; each isolate contains a
   different number of rDNA repeats and the number of these repeats can vary as much as 4-fold from
25 strain to strain (i.e. -50 units to 200 units). Since the input target copy numbers will vary slightly
   from strain to strain and certainly from species to species, there will be subtle differences in the
   absolute T2 values observed at very low cell numbers (i.e. 10 cells/mL). Based on our very
   preliminary study, the data suggests a cut-off of 10 cells/mL; however this determination cannot be
   made in the absence of final formulations of reagents as well as the instrument/cartridge. It does
30 suggest that defining the C5-C95 interval will be difficult because at 10 cells/mL each reaction
   contains only 4 cells. Titrating at cell numbers lower than this becomes challenging with this input
   volume of blood. Using the Poisson distribution to calculate the number of reactions that would
   contain 0 cells at 10 cells/mL indicates only 2% of the reactions would not contain cells; however at 5
   cells/mL, 13% of the reactions will contain no Candida cells, and at 2 cells/mL, -37% of the reactions
35 would not contain Candida cells. To increase the assay's sensitivity to 95% at 10 cells/iL, we could
                                                       - 170

   increase the amount of lysate added to the PCR reactions from 40 ptL to 50 ptL and increase the
   amount of patient blood from 400 ptL to 800 iL/reaction.
               Preliminary determination of sensitivity/specificity: Initially, quantification of input Candida
   colony forming units was conducted using a hemocytometer; however in this case the operator
 5 counted budding daughter cells as separate cells. As our data is reported in colony forming units/mL
   and not cells/mL, buds should not be quantified. Because of this error, fewer cells/mL of Candida
   are present at the various spike concentrations and our sensitivity at 10 cells/mL was only 90%, while
   our specificity was 100%. At 25 cells/mL or greater we observe 100% sensitivity and 100%
   specificity. In all cases, blood culture vials inoculated with Candida cells were blood culture positive
10 by day 8. It should be noted that the default setting for blood culture is incubation for 5 days;
   however we needed to extend this incubation time as many of our inoculums required >5 days
   incubation. As an example, Table 1OA shows the time from inoculation to culture positive recorded
   for four different C. albicans clinical isolates inoculated into blood culture.
               The results of T2 measurements conducted on 800 ptL aliquots from these spiked whole blood
15 samples is shown in Table 10B. In all cases we were able to detect at 25 cells/mL, or greater,
   however we were unable to detect clinical isolate C3 at 12 cells/mL. It is important to note the CFU's
   were quantified via hemocytometer and not Coulter counter for this particular method compare
   experiment. In total 51 blood culture bottles were inoculated with hemocytomer quantified Candida
   albicans clinical isolates and 35 negative blood culture vials were included in the experiment. The
20 results for inoculums greater than 25 cells/mL are shown in the contingency table in Table 11.

               Standardization of CFU quantification has improved our assay sensitivity and reproducibility.
   Preliminary results from 27 blood culture bottles are shown in Table 12. These preliminary results
   indicate we have 100% sensitivity and specificity at 10 cells/mL or greater. We have additionally
   begun method comparisons using C. krusei. Preliminary results (from 36 vials) are shown in Table
15 13. The results indicate we have a sensitivity/specificity of 88%/100% at 10 cells/mL or greater and
   100%sensitivity/100% specificity at 33 cells/mL or greater for Candida krusei. Another important
   change which was instituted prior to the new blood culture agreement comparisons was the
   employment of a multi-probe particle. In this case the T 2 clustering reactions for C. albicans detection
   were conducted using albicans/parapsilosis/tropicalis multi-functional particles while C. krusei was
20 detected using the glabrata/krusei multi-functional particles.

                Preliminary assessment of clinical accuracy: Clinical accuracy is defined as the ability to
   discriminate between two or more clinical states, for example Candidemia versus no Candidemia.
   Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) plots describe the test's performance graphically illustrating
   the relationship between sensitivity (true positive fraction) and specificity (true negative fraction).
10 The clinical accuracy (sensitivity/specificity pairs) is displayed for the entire spectrum of decision
   levels. Using the data generated from the 10 cells/mL and 50 cells/mL clinical isolate spiked whole
   blood samples, two ROC plots were generated and are shown in Figures 50A and 50B. The area
   under the curve is often used to quantify the diagnostic accuracy; in this case our ability to
   discriminate between a Candidemic patient with an infection of 10 cells/mL or 50 cells/mL versus a
15 patient with no Candidemia. At 10 cells/mL the area under the curve is 0.72 which means that if the
   T 2 assay was run on a randomly chosen person with Candidemia at a level of infection of 10 cells/mL,
   there is an 72% chance their T2 value would be higher than a person with no Candidemia. The
   clinical accuracy of the test is much higher at 50 cells/mL with the area under the curve at 0.98.
   Again indicating that in a person with Candidemia at this level of infection, the T 2 assay would give a
20 value higher than a sample from a patient without Candidemia 98% of the time. This is excellent
   clinical accuracy for infection levels of 50 cells/mL. ROC plots were not prepared for the 100
   cells/mL samples or higher as the area would be translating to 100% clinical diagnostic accuracy.
   Final clinical accuracy is determined from real patient samples on the clinical platform.
                Assay turnaround time: The primary assay steps with estimated times are: (i) hypotonic
25 lysis/centrifugation / bead beating (8 min); (ii) PCR (120 min.); (iii) hybridization of amplicon to
   particles (30 min.); (iv) hMAA (10 min.); and (v) transfer and read (10 sec.). The processing time for
   the assay is estimated at ~ 178 minutes (-3 hrs), excluding reagent and equipment preparation. This
   is the workflow used for qualification; however we have demonstrated that the following modified
   work-flow with shorter PCR and hybridization steps does yield the same detection sensitivity (see
30 Figure 51) (albeit with a reduction in the amount of amplicon generated for some Candida species
   (i.e., glabrata) and hence a smaller delta T 2 between diseased and normal): (i) hypotonic
   lysis/centrifugation / bead beating (8 min.); (ii) PCR (70 min.); (iii) hybridization of amplicon to
   particles (30 min.); (iv) hMAA (10 min.); and (v) transfer and read (10 sec.). This modified flow

   generates a TAT of 133 minutes or 2 hours and 13 minutes (and this is without migration to a faster
   thermocycler).
                Conclusions
                This testing demonstrates a current T 2 based molecular diagnostic assay for Candidemia with
 5 the following metrics: (i) detection of Candida albicans within whole blood at a range spanning 5
    1E5 cells/mL (5-log); (ii) detection of Candida krusei within whole blood at a range spanning 10
   cells/mL to IE5 cells/mL; (iii) sensitivity/specificity of 100%/100% at > 25 cells/mL; (iv) diagnostic
   accuracy of greater than 98% for concentrations > 50 cells/mL; (v) assay compatibility with whole
   blood (no major matrix effects observed using twelve different donor blood samples); (vi)
10 repeatability of T 2 measurements (less than 12% within the same day and less than 13% across eight
   days); and (vii) reduced total assay turnaround time to 2 hours 3 minutes.
                We have tested higher input volumes of human blood and found that efficient hypotonic lysis
   is achievable with these larger blood volumes; further it has increased the reproducibility of detection
   at 10 cells/mL.
15              Contamination was observed within 2 samples of the 50 titrations. To reduce contamination
   issues, the PCR steps may be separated from the detection steps. Further, chemical/biochemical
   methods may be used to render the amplicons unamplifiable. For example, uracils may be
   incorporated into the PCR product, and a pre-PCR incubation may be conducted with uracil N
   glycosylase.
20              The advantages of the systems and methods of the invention include the ability to assay
   whole blood samples without separating proteins and non-target nucleic acids from the sample.
   Because no losses in target nucleic acids are incurred through DNA purification (e.g., running Qiagen
   column after lysis and prior to amplification results in >10x loss in sensitivity; and use of whole
   blood interferes with optical detection methods at concentrations above 1%), sample-to-sample
25 variability and biases (which can be introduced by DNA purification) are minimized and sensitivity is
   maximized.
                Over 10% of septic shock patients are carriers of Candida; this is the third most prevalent
   pathogen after S. aureus & E. coli, and there is an approximately 50% mortality rate for septic shock
   patients infected with Candida. Candida is the fourth leading cause of hospital acquired infections.
30 Rapid identification of these patients is critical to selecting proper treatment regimens.
                Example 18. Viral assay.
                CMV genomic DNA was spiked into CMV-free healthy donor blood samples, 40 pL of this
   spiked blood was aliquoted into a 100 piL total volume PCR reaction. Amplification was conducted
35 using a whole blood compatible thermophilic DNA polymerase (T2 Biosystems, Lexington, MA) and

   exemplary universal primers that were designed as follows: 24 mer end-C6 linker-CMV specific
   sequence, the exact sequences were as follows:
   5'-CAT GAT CTG CTG GAG TCT GAC GTT A-3'                       (SEQ ID NO. 11, universal tail probe #1)
   5'-GCA GAT CTC CTC AAT GCG GCG-3'                      (SEQ ID NO. 12, universal tail probe #2)
 5 5'-CGT GCC ACC GCA GAT AGT AAG-3'                      (SEQ ID NO. 13, CMV US8 forward primer)
   5'-GAA TAC AGA CAC TTA GAG CTC GGG-3'                         (SEQ ID NO. 14, CMV US8 reverse primer)
                The primers were designed such that the capture probes (i.e., the nucleic acid decorating the
   magnetic particle) would anneal to the 1Omer region (1Omers are different on either 5' or 3' end).
   The final primer concentration in the reaction tube was 300 nM and PCR master mix which included
10 5mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 3.5 mM MgCl 2 , 6% glycerol, 60 mM Tricine (pH 8.7)). Five separate sample
   reaction tubes were set up. Cycle PCR reactions followed an initial denaturation of 95 'C for 3
   minutes, and each cycle consisted of 95 'C, 20 seconds; 55 'C, 30 seconds; and 68 'C, 20 seconds.
   At 30, 33, 36, 39, and 42 cycles reaction tubes were removed and maintained at 4 'C. Once all
   samples were ready, 5 tL of particle master mix (6xSSC, 30% formamide, 0.10%Tween) was
15 aliquoted into the tube for every 10 piL of amplified sample; the resulting mixture was well mixed and
   the sample denatured at 95 'C for 3 minutes; the sample was hybridized at 45 'C for 1 hour with
   gentle agitation; the sample was then diluted to 150 piL with particle dilution buffer (PBS, 0.1%
   Tween, 0.1% BSA), placed into a temperature controlled hMAA magnet for 10 minutes, and
   equilibrated to 37 'C in a heat block for 1 minute; and the T2 relaxation time for each of the five
20 separate samples was measured using a T2 MR reader (see Figure 52).
                The primers were designed to allow the magnetic particles decorated with capture probes to
   anneal to the 1Omer region (1Omers are different on either 5' or 3' end), providing particles with a
   universal architecture for aggregation with specific amplification primers.
                The results provided in Figure 52 show that the methods and systems of the invention can be
25 used to perform real time PCR and provide quantitative information about the amount of target
   nucleic acid present in a whole blood sample.
                Example 19. Real-time PCR
                Previous results showed that when particles were present in the PCR reaction the amplicon
30 production was inhibited. We hypothesize that moving the particles to the side of the reaction tube
   during the thermocycling will allow production of amplicon. A simple magnetic separator/PCR block
   insert (Figure 53) was designed to keep nanoparticles on the side walls during PCR reaction, thus
   minimizing interference and particle exposure to the PCR reaction components. Upon removal of the
   magnetic field, particles can be completely resuspended into the reaction mixture.
35              In one experiment, we tested the rate at which particles could be sequestered to the side of the
   tube and returned to solution. In this experiment, 100 tL of the C. albicans (3' and 5') particle mix in

               As shown in Table 14, fully reversible nanoparticle clustering was demonstrated at 950 C
   when using the tested magnetic separator. Particles are stable at 95 0 C for at least 3
15 clustering/unclustering cycles.
               We next tested PCR efficiency in the presence of nanoparticles in reaction solution. PCR was
   performed under two conditions: (1) nanoparticles are fully dispersed in solution; and (2)
   nanoparticles are concentrated on the PCR test tube side walls using magnetic insert.
               Three PCR reactions (with nanoparticles concentrated on the test tube wall; fully dispersed in
20 solution; and no nanoparticles) were set up using C. albicans genomic DNA as a starting material.
   Successful target DNA amplification was validated using gel electrophoresis. Capture-probe
   decorated Seramag particles were used.
               Asymmetric (4:1) PCR reactions were setup using pre-made PCR mix and 100 copies of
   genomic C. albicans DNA as a starting material. C. albicans capture particle mix (3' and 5') in 1x TE
25 was added to reactions (1) and (3) (baseline -150msec). Control reaction (2) did not have
   nanoparticles added (Figure 54).
               No difference was observed in PCR product formation when nanoparticles were present in
   solution (dispersed in solution or concentrated on test tube side walls via magnetic field) during
   PCR. Therefore, nanoparticles modified with capture probes do not interfere with PCR.
30 Comparable amounts of product were generated in the reactions with and without nanoparticles

   present in solution as evidenced by gel electrophoresis. Also, magnetic concentration of
   nanoparticles on test tube side walls during PCR process does not have an effect on the PCR.
                Example 20. Internal Controls for C. Albicans.
 5              A variety of impurities and components of whole blood can be inhibitory to the polymerase
   and primer annealing. These inhibitors can lead to generation of false positives and low sensitivities.
   To assure that clinical specimens are successfully amplified and detected, the assay can include an
   internal control nucleic acid that contains primer binding regions identical to those of the target
   sequence. The target nucleic acid and internal control are selected such that each has a unique probe
10 binding region that differentiates the internal control from the target nucleic acid. The internal control
   can be an inhibition control that is designed to co-amplify with the nucleic acid target being detected.
   Failure of the internal inhibition control to be amplified is evidence of a reagent failure or process
   error. Universal primers can be designed such that the target sequence and the internal control
   sequence are amplified in the same reaction tube. Thus, using this format, if the target DNA is
15 amplified but the internal control is not it is then assumed that the target DNA is present in a
   proportionally greater amount than the internal control and the positive result is valid as the internal
   control amplification is unnecessary. If, on the other hand, neither the internal control nor the target
   is amplified it is then assumed that inhibition of the PCR reaction has occurred and the test for that
   particular sample is not valid.
20              The already amplified and detected Candida albicans sequence was examined for use in
   generating an internal control. The universal primer sequences were removed from the 5' and 3'
   ends. The residual internal sequence was subjected to a random sequence generator and a random
   sequence was generated. The universal primer sequences were replaced at the ends and the full
   internal control sequence was cloned into pCR2. 1-TOPO and was sequence verified.
25              In designing these internal controls, the following criteria and features for use in diagnostic
   PCR assays were employed: 1) the target and internal control DNA share the same primers; 2) the
   internal control and target DNA are easily distinguishable (i.e. different capture probes); 3) the
   amplification efficiencies of the target and internal control have been tested and are acceptable; 4) the
   source of the internal control is a plasmid DNA carrying the cloned internal control sequence; 5) the
30 internal control is detected by sequence dependent hybridization; 6) the internal control plasmid is
   highly purified; 7) the concentration of the internal control is determined by titration; 8) the internal
   control plasmid is added to the PCR mix to ensure equal distribution to all of the PCR tubes; 9) it has
   been determined the amount of internal control in the assay reaction tubes is 100-1000 copies/
   reaction and this concentration has been determined to be the lowest amount that still elicits a signal
35 via amplification. See Hoofar et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 42:1863 (2004).

                The internal inhibition control for the Candida assay was designed to co-amplify with the Pan
   Candida PCR primers and contain a unique intervening sequence of similar length and base
   composition as the Candida species. The intervening sequence was developed by applying a
   sequence randomizing algorithm to the C. ablicans amplicon sequence. Four randomized sequences
 5 were then thermodynamically and bioinformatically characterized. A nucleotide megaBLAST search
   was conducted for each sequence using both the human genomic + transcript database as well as the
   nr database. No significant alignments were identified with the four query sequences in either
   database. Each sequence was then subjected to UNAfold analysis to determine the extent of
   secondary structure present at the hybridization concentration of monovalent cation (600 mM) at a
10 temperature of 60 degrees C. Two sequences were excluded at this point due to the presence of
   extensive stems under these hybridization conditions. Two were further characterized to determine if
   capture probes could be designed complementary to the 5' and 3' ends of the strand amplified in
   excess that would be devoid of poly-G tracts, and have low probabilities of forming homo and
   heterodimers. One sequence met all the criteria and was ordered as a PAGE purified synthetic
15 oligonucleotide and its respective complement from IDT Technologies (Coralville, IA). The
   sequence of the internal control that will be amplified in excess is:

                5 uM of the annealed duplex in 2x SSC was sent to SeqWright for subcloning and

30 cloning vector. This construct was cloned into pCR2. 1-TOPO. Upon transformation, 5 clones were
   selected and sequenced to confirm the presence of the correct insert. Upon verification of the correct
   cloned insert, the mini-prepped plasmid DNA should be digested with EcoR V and HindIl and the

                Example 21. Rotary gMAA.
                Three prototype rotary gMAA configurations were designed, built and tested with comparison
   to the conventional plate based gMAA (see Figure 56A). The three configurations included varying
   magnetic field exposures - side-bottom; side-null and bottom-null. The plate based gMAA used for
15 comparison is the standard side-bottom. Assay functional performance (non-specific binding and
   clustering) was evaluated using the Creatinine agglomerative assay system. Particles derivatized with
   creatinine antibody were mixed with 1:5 diluted serum and creatinine dextran agglomerator. The
   agglomerator was tested at 6 concentrations to provide a titration curve. Each concentration level was
   tested in triplicate. The T2 of samples with no agglomerator was measured before and after gMAA to
20 assess non-specific binding. gMAA was performed at room temperature for a total of 12 minutes with
    1 minute dwells at the magnet stations.
                With respect to non-specific binding, all rotary configurations yielded acceptable results
   (<10% difference) and were comparable to the conventional plate gMAA.
                With respect to aggregate formation, all rotary gMAA devices produced aggregation. The
25 rotary side-bottom configuration provided the highest T2 signal at a given agglomerator
   concentration, followed by the comparison side-bottom plate configuration. Rotary side-null provides
   equivalent signal to the plate side-bottom; and the bottom-null produces the lowest signal (see Figure
   56B).
30              Example 22. Candida assay and clinical data.
                A rapid, accurate, and reproducible molecular diagnostic test was developed for the detection
   of five Candidaspecies directly within human whole blood with a limit of detection (LOD) of 10
   cells/mL and a time to result of less than 2 hours. The assay's clinical performance was determined
   using 32 blinded clinical specimens and in this study we observed 100% positive and 100% negative
35 agreement with blood culture while accurately identifying the causative Candidaspecies within 100%
   of the candidemic patient samples. We further applied the assay to blood specimens drawn from

 5              Magnetic Resonance Relaxometer
                A compact magnetic resonance (MR) system was designed and constructed for precise T2
   relaxation measurements in order to perform the intended assay under the described conditions. This
   system was held at 37'C via temperature control and contains a samarium cobalt permanent magnet
   of approximately 0.5 T, corresponding to a proton frequency of operation of 22-24 MHz. All
10 standard MR components: radio frequency probe, low-noise pre-amplifier and transmitter electronics,
   spectrometer board, as well as the temperature control hardware are packaged in the system. The
   system uses standard AC power input and connects to an external computer via Ethernet. A user
   friendly graphical user interface allows users to set experimental parameters.
                The system has been designed to accept samples in standard 0.2 ml PCR tubes. The
15 electronics as well as the coil were optimized to improve the measurement precision of the applicable
   sample volumes, allowing us to achieve single-scan run to run CVs in T2 of less than 0.1 %.
   Instrument to instrument variability is under 2% with minimal tolerance requirements on the system
   components and without calibration.
20              Nanoparticle Sensor Conjugation and Characterization
                800 nm carboxylated iron oxide superparamagnetic particles, consisting of numerous iron
   oxide nanocrystals embedded in a polymer matrix including a total particle diameter of 800 nm (see
   Demas et al., New J. Phys. 13:1 (2011)), were conjugated to aminated DNA oligonucleotides using
   standard carbodiimide chemistry. DNA-derivatized nanoparticles were stored at 4'C in 1x Tris
25 EDTA (pH 8), 0.1% Tween-20. Iron concentration of nanoparticle conjugates were measured by
   dissolving the particle with 6M HCl followed by addition of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 1,10
   0-phenanthroline and subsequent spectrophotometric detection as described in Owen et al., J
   Immunol Methods, 73:41 (1984). Oligonucleotide derivatized particles are then subjected to a
   functional performance test by conducting hybridization induced agglomeration reactions using
30 diluted synthetic oligonucleotide targets identical in sequence to the fungal ITS2 sequences from the
   five different Candida species within a sodium phosphate hybridization buffer 4xSSPE (600 mM
   NaCl, 40 mM sodium phosphate, 4mM EDTA). Reversibility of the agglomeration reaction was
   confirmed by subjecting agglomerated reactions to a 95'C heat denaturation step, conducting a T2
   measurement, and repeat hybridization at 60'C followed by a second T2 measurement.

                PCR primer and nanoparticle capture probe design
                Universal Pan Candida PCR primers were designed complementary to 5.8S and 26S rRNA
   sequences that amplify the intervening transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region of the Candida genome. A
   pair of oligonucleotide capture probes was designed complementary to nested sequences at the 5' and
 5 3' end respectively of the asymmetrically amplified PCR product. The capture probe that hybridizes
   to the 5' end of the amplicon was 3' aminated while the capture probe that hybridizes to the 3' end of
   the amplicon was 5' aminated. A poly-T linker (n=9 to 24) is added between the amino group and the
   first nucleotide base of the capture probe sequence. HPLC purified PCR primers and capture probes
   were procured from IDT Technologies (Coralville, IA).

                Inhibition Control Design
                A PCR inhibition control was designed to co-amplify with the Candida species and monitor
   factors within the whole blood specimens that inhibit PCR amplification. A synthetic template was
   designed to contain 30 nucleotide flanking sequences identical in sequence to the 5.8S and 26S
15 regions of the Candida rRNA operon. The internal sequence within this template consists of a
   randomly scrambled C. albicans amplicon. Capture probes were designed complementary to the
   strand amplified in excess within the asymmetric Candida PCR reactions. Synthetic oligonucleotide
   ultramers were procured from IDT (Coralville, IA) identical in sequence to the inhibition control.
   The oligonucleotides were annealed at a concentration of 5 tM in 2xSSC and cloned into
20 HindII/EcoRV digested pBR322 (NEB, Ipswich, MA) using standard methods. Transformation was
   conducted via electroporation of 1 tL of the ligation reaction into electrocompetant E. coli K12 cells
   and the transformants were plated onto Luria Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 100 pag/mL
   ampicillin. Two ampicillin resistant colonies were selected and cultivated in 2 mL LB ampicillin
   media. Plasmid mini-preps were conducted followed by restriction enzyme mapping to confirm the
25 clones contained the correct insert. Sanger dideoxy sequencing was then conducted (SeqWright,
   Houston,TX) to confirm successful cloning of the control and DNA maxi-preps were conducted on
   correct insert bearing clones. Titrations of the inhibition control in the presence of increasing
   concentrations of all 5 species of Candida were conducted to determine the lowest concentration of
   inhibition control that could be reproducibly detected. Confirmation of the function of the inhibition

   yeast peptone dextrose agar plates (YPD) and incubated at 25 'C. Single colonies were selected and
   suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The species were verified via ITS2 sequencing at
   Accugenix (Newark, Delaware). The cells were then subjected to a low speed centrifugation (3000 g
   for 2 minutes) and washed three times with fresh PBS. An aliquot of the PBS washed cells was then
 5 diluted in ISOTON II diluent (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) within a 20 mL Accuvette and cells were
   quantified on a Multisizer 4 Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) following the
   manufacturers instruction. Cells were then serially diluted to concentrations ranging from 500 to 5
   cells/100 tL PBS buffer. Fresh human healthy donor blood drawn by sterile collection in K2EDTA
   vacutainer tubes (BD Diagnostics, Franklin Lakes, NJ ) was obtained from ProMedX. Typically five
10 milliliters of human blood was spiked with 100 piL of quantified Candida cells. Whole blood spiked
   samples are then used immediately in the assay.
                Whole Blood PCR
                Erythrocyte lysis was conducted within 1 mL of the whole blood sample using previously
15 described methods (see Bramley et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes,
   241:752 (1971) and Wessels JM, Biochim Biophys Acta., 2:178 (1973)), a low speed centrifugation is
   then conducted and the supernatant was removed and discarded. One hundred uL of Tris EDTA (TE)
   buffer pH 8.0 containing 1500 copies of the inhibition control was then added to the harvested pellets
   and the suspension was subjected to mechanical lysis (see Garver et al., Appl. Microbiol. , 1959.
20 7:318 (1959); Hamilton et al., Appl. Microbiol., 10: 577 (1962); and Ranhand, J.M., Appl. Microbiol.,
   28:66 (1974)). Fifty piL of lysate was then added to 50 piL of an asymmetric PCR master mix
   containing a deoxynucleotides, PCR primers and a whole blood compatible thermophilic DNA
   polymerase (T2 Biosystems, Lexington, MA). Thermocycling was conducted using the following
   cycle parameters: heat denaturation at 95'C for 5 minutes, 40 cycles consisting of a 30 second 95'C
25 heat denaturation step, a 20 second 62'C annealing step, and a 30 second 68'C elongation step, and a
   final extension at 68'C for 10 minutes.
                Hybridization induced agglomeration assays
                Fifteen microliters of the resulting amplification reaction was aliquoted into 0.2 mL thin
30 walled PCR tubes and incubated within a sodium phosphate hybridization buffer (4xSSPE) with pairs
   of oligonucleotide derivatized nanoparticles at a final iron concentration of 0.2 mM iron per reaction.
   Hybridization reactions were incubated for 3 minutes at 95'C followed by 30 minutes incubation at
   60'C within a shaking incubator set at an agitation speed of 1000 rpm (Vortemp, LabNet
   International). Hybridized samples are then placed in a 37'C heating block to equilibrate the
35 temperature to that of the MR reader for 3 minutes. Each sample is then subjected to a 5 second
   vortexing step (3000 rpm) and inserted into the MR reader for T2 measurement.

                Candida Patient sample collection protocol.
                Blood specimen discards that had been drawn in K2EDTA vacutainers (BD) on the same day
   as specimens drawn for blood culture (T=0) were obtained from the clinical hematology laboratory at
 5 the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) or Houston University Hospital. Specimens were
   collected and catalogued from patients having blood culture positive results. Samples were stored
   within the original vacutainer at -80'C and the blinded specimen collection was shipped overnight on
   dry ice to T2 Biosystems. Clinical sample collection protocols were reviewed by the appropriate
   Human Research Committees.

                Statistical analyses
                For each species, the limit of detection was determined with the use of probit modeling. For
   each species, the 90% level of detection and 95% fiducial intervals were calculated. Each raw T2
   signal was transformed as T2_msec over the assay's background. SAS v. 9.1.3 (Cary, NC) was used
15 in the statistical calculations for the analyses for limit of detection, agreement of spiked specimens
   with culture, sensitivity and specificity in clinical specimens, and serial assays to measure Candida
   clearance.
                Agreement of T2 MR detection of Candida with blood culture
20              The current gold standard for Candida diagnosis is blood culture. In vitro spiked healthy
   donor whole blood specimens were prepared using laboratory reference strains for C. albicans and C.
   krusei and clinical isolates of C. albicans at concentrations of 0, 33, and 100 cells/mL. Pediatric
   BACTEC blood culture vials (BACTEC Peds Plus/F vials, Beckton Dickenson) were inoculated with
   an aliquot of the in-vitro spiked specimens evaluated by T2MR. Blood culture vials inoculated with
25 Candidacells were blood culture positive by day 8 in all cases. In total, 133 blood culture bottles
   were inoculated with 90 Candida spiked blood samples (inoculum of 33 cells/mL) or 43 negative
   blood samples. Ninety eight percent positive agreement and 100% negative agreement was observed
   between T2MR and blood culture.
30              Clinical Specimen Data
                K2 EDTA whole blood patient specimens were obtained to test the clinical performance of
   the T2MR Candida assay. The patients presented with symptoms of septicemia and blood was drawn
   for culture. Blood sample retains were stored at 4'C in the hematology lab and selected for T2MR if
   the outcome was blood culture positive for Candida,blood culture positive for bacteremia, or blood
35 culture negative to better represent the spectrum of samples that would be run on the platform.
   Fourteen of the samples were from candidemic patients, eight were from bacteremic patients, and ten
                                                         - 183

   were from blood-culture negative patients. Figure 57 shows the measured T2 values for all 32 patient
   samples. A single PCR reaction was conducted using 1 mL of each specimen. 750 copies of the
   internal inhibition control were added to each PCR reaction. Among Candida negative samples the
   average internal control (IC) signal was 279 ms with a CV across the 18 Candida negative specimens
 5 of 25%. In no cases was the IC signal below the decision threshold (128 ms, 5 standard deviations
   added to the mean T2 measured in Candida negative detection reactions) suggesting that all negatives
   were true negatives and no inhibitory substances were present with the whole blood samples. The
   detection reactions were multiplexed based on IDSA guidelines, such that three results were reported
   as follows: C. albicans or C tropicalispositive; C.krusei or C. glabratapositive; and C. parapsilosis
10 positive. The average T2 measured in the Candida negative specimens is 114 ms, the CV for these
   measurements was 2.4%, and the decision threshold (calculated by addition of five times the standard
   deviation measured in the Candida negative detection reactions plus the mean T2 measured in
   Candida negative specimens) was 128 ms. In specimens positive for Candida, the IC signal was
   suppressed due to competition for the amplification reagents. In instances of high C. albicans, some
15 cross-reactivity was observed for detection with the C. parapsilosisparticles (e.g. patient sample #3)
   however this signal is not significantly above the cut-off (20 ms) and does not lead to a difference in
   antifungal therapy as both C. albicans and C. parapsilosisare susceptible to fluconazole.
                T2MR successfully identified fourteen samples of C. albicans, C. parapsilosis,or C. krusei
   which were confirmed positive by blood culture followed by the Vitek 2 biochemical card.
20 Furthermore, the detection was specific for Candida spp. as bacteremic patient samples with
   Escherichiacoli, Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiellapneumoniae, coagulase
   negative Staphylococcus, or alpha hemolytic Streptococcus remained negative.
                Serially drawn samples were tested from two patients who exhibited symptoms suggestive of
   candidemia, such as persistent fever after receiving antibiotics to demonstrate the assay's utility in
25 monitoring Candida clearance. Blood draws for T2MR occurred the same day as blood draws for
   blood culture. Surveillance cultures were then drawn over a course of nine days for Patient A and
   over a course of five days for Patient B. Figure 3 shows the results obtained with the T2MR method
   for both patients. Patient A had blood drawn for culture (t=0), was diagnosed with candidemia and
   administered intravenous micafungin (C. glabrata)the following day via blood culture (t=1). Whole
30 blood specimens were tested with T2MR at t=0 days, t=3 days, t=7 days, t=8 days, t= 9 days. The
   T2MR values obtained were 320 ms at t=0, 467 ms at t=3, 284 ms at t=7, 245 ms at t=8, and 117 ms
   (below cut-off) for t=9. Subsequent blood culture draws on day 3 and day 8 took 24 and 48 hours to
   culture positive, respectively. A series of serially drawn specimens were obtained from Patient B. C.
   albicans was correctly detected with T2MR on day 0 (T2 = 426 ms). Blood culture came up positive
35 on day 2 with subsequent C. albicans identification. One day after the patient was administered
   micafungin, a sharp decrease in C. albicans T2MR was evident (T2= 169 ms) and three or more days
                                                      - 184
   10382990_1 (GHMatters) P92976.AU.2

   after antifungal treatment was initiated no detectable C. albicans was observed. All tests were
   completed in a total processing time of two hours, using a fast block PCR thermocycler and three step
   thermocycling procedure that was not optimized for speed.
 5              Conclusions
                We have developed and validated a whole blood T2MR Candida assay capable of detecting
   five clinically important species of Candida that leverages the advantages of non-optical detection to
   eliminate analyte purification, thus enabling enable more rapid turn-around times and more
   reproducible results. Asymmetric PCR was used to specifically amplify the ITS2 region of the
10 Candida genome directly in whole blood to achieve clinically relevant detection sensitivities. A T2
   detection method was developed in which two pools of oligonucleotide derivatized nanoparticles
   hybridize to each end of the single stranded amplicon. The amplicons thus serve as interparticle
   tethers and induce nanoparticle agglomeration which yields a measurable and reproducible change in
   the spin-spin relaxometry (T2) of the protons in water molecules. We further constructed and
15 implemented an internal inhibition control to monitor for PCR inhibitors that may be present in the
   patient samples.
                The assay was evaluated using reference strains and clinical isolates quantified by Coulter
   Counter and spiked into healthy donor whole blood. Assay repeatability was measured using C.
   albicans spiked blood (same sample, same operator, same instrument) over the course of 10 days and
20 we observe CV's less than 12.8% (n=30) over the entire dynamic response range (0 to 1E5 cells/mL).
   The analytical sensitivity and limit of detection of <10 cells/mL were measured for C. albicans, C.
   tropicalis,C. krusei, and C. parapsilosisand >10 cells/mL with 92.5% detected at 10 cells/mL for C.
   glabrata. Although not proven, a possible cause of the higher LoD observed in C. glabratamay be
   that the rDNA operon copy number is reduced in C. glabrata as compared to the other queried
25 Candida spp since it is known that C. glabrataexists in nature as a haploid while the other Candida
   species are diploids. Agreement with the gold standard for Candida diagnosis was high with 98%
   positive and 100% negative agreement observed for 133 in vitro spiked C. albicans and C. krusei
   samples. It should be noted that the time to result was 2 hours for the T2 Candida test while the time
   to blood culture positivity was typically 2 days for C. albicans and -1 day (18-24 hours) for Candida
30 krusei.
                The 32 clinical specimens are similar to blood culture results. The measured T2 was above a
   cut-off established at five standard deviations of the T2 values measured in the Candidanegative
   specimens added to their mean. In this case the threshold was 128 ms (n=54). In no cases did we
   observe inhibition of the PCR reaction, as the internal control was detected within all 32 reactions
35 with a reduced IC signal observed in Candida positive patients and a CV of 25% (mean T2 of 279
   ms) across the Candidanegative specimens (n=18). The assay is highly specific for Candida
                                                        - 185

   detection as no cross-reactivity was observed with any of the bacteremic specimens (n=8). Candida
   positive specimens were accurately identified, the causative Candida spp. was accurately identified,
   and all within a time to answer of 2 hours.
                The potential for this assay to provide a rapid detection of Candida clearance after
 5 administration of antifungal therapy was also demonstrated. Two sets of patient samples were drawn
   and subjected to T2MR (Figure 3). Moderate to high T2 signals for C. glabratawere observed in
   patient A at day 0 and day 3 with antifungal agents administered at day 1. A decrease in C. glabrata
   signal was observed over subsequent days with none detectable after eight days of anti-fungal
   treatment. A strong C. albicans signal was measured for patient B at day 0, and a sharp decline (delta
10 T2 of 306 ms) in T2 signal was observed one day after antifungal administration with none detectable
   after two days of anti-fungal treatment. Although preliminary, this data suggests the test could be used
   to monitor treatment effectiveness and Candida clearance in a real-time fashion.
                In conclusion, we have developed a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of candidemia
   caused by the five most commonly encountered Candida species. Early clinical results were
15 encouraging and show that rapid diagnosis and species identification is achievable and could not only
   facilitate early treatment with the appropriate antifungal but also provide a means to monitor Candida
   clearance. We anticipate that this nanoparticle-based T2MR method can be broadly applied to
   infectious disease diagnoses in a variety of specimen types and pathogens.
20 Example 23. Tacrolimus assay utilizing Fab.
                The tacrolimus assay is a homogeneous competitive immunoassay performed using an EDTA
   whole blood sample extracted to release tacrolimus from the red blood cells and binding proteins. A
   key component of the assay is a high affinity tacrolimus antibody, a reliable extraction method, and
   improvement of the buffer systems selected to promote specific aggregation and minimize non
25 specific aggregation. This version of the assay utilizes a recombinant monovalent Fab with high
   affinity for tacrolimus.
                The tacrolimus assay was assessed using whole blood calibrators, commercial whole blood
   controls, spiked samples and patient samples.
                Assay reagents included: (a) 244 nm particle conjugated with sequential BSA, and
30 monovalent Fab antibody and blocked with maPEG-thiol + NEM (particle is diluted to 0.2 mM Fe in
   assay buffer); (b) C22 modified tacrolimus conjugated to BSA at tacrolimus to BSA input ratio of
    10:1 (diluted to 600 ng/ml in assay buffer); (c) assay buffer of 100 mM Glycine pH 9.0, 1%BSA,
   0.05% Tween 80, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Proclin; and (d) extraction reagent of 70% MeOH, 60
   mM ZnSO4 in dH20.
35              Whole blood calibrators were prepared using 1 mg/ml Sigma FK506 Stock in 100% MeOH.
   EDTA whole blood was spiked at varying levels with the tacrolimus solution. The spiked blood was
                                                         - 186

   incubated at 37 'C with gentle mixing and then stored overnight at 4'C prior to aliquoting and
   freezing. Target levels were 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 250 ng/ml of tacrolimus. The calibrators
   were provided to an external lab for value assignment by the Architect Tacrolimus assay. The
   samples were assayed by mass spectroscopy. Results show a correlation of 0.9998 for theoretical
 5 versus actual value assignment
                Quality controls consisted of 3 levels of UTAK Immunosuppressant Matrix Controls. Patient
   samples were obtained from transplant patients on tacrolimus therapy.
                The testing protocol was as follows:
                (i) Allow all samples, calibrators, QC and reagents to equilibrate to room temperature, mix by
10 gentle inversion.
                (ii) Pipette 200 tL of sample, calibrator, or QC material into a 1.5 mL microfuge tube. Add
   200 uL of extraction reagent and vortex for 30 secs. Allow the sample to incubate for 2 minutes at
   room temperature, and centrifuge for 5 minutes at 10,000 rpm. Transfer the clean supernatant to a
   clean tube and prepare a 2.5x dilution using assay buffer.
15              (iii) pipette 10 tL of the diluted extract and 10 piL of diluted particle into the reaction tube,
   vortex mix and incubate for 15 minutes at 37 'C. Pipette 20 tL of BSA-tac conjugate into the
   reaction tube, vortex mix and incubate for 15 minutes at 37 'C. Perform gMAA for 6 cycles (12
   min.). Vortex mix, incubate for 5 minutes at 37 'C and read in the T2 reader at 37 'C.
                Calibrators were tested in triplicate for each test run (6 total runs). Individual run data were
20 fit with a 5PL model using GraphPad Prism 5 for Windows, version 5.02, GraphPad Software, San
   Diego California USA. The 0 calibrator was entered as 0.01 ng/ml and used in the curve model. The
   resulting calibration curves (Run Calibration) were used to back-calculate the tacrolimus
   concentration for all calibrators, whole blood spikes, QC and patient samples contained in the run.
                In addition, a Master Calibration curve was obtained by fitting data across the entire 3-day
25 study (n=1 8) for each calibrator. All samples were back-calculated using the Master Curve and the
   resulting tacrolimus levels compared to those obtained using the Run Calibration.
                A reproducibility panel consisting of 13 members (9 calibrators, 3 controls and 1 spiked
   whole blood sample) was tested in triplicate for 3 days with 2 runs per day for a total of 18 replicates.
   Calibrators were stored at -80 'C while the controls and whole blood spike were stored at 4-8 'C for
30 the duration of the study.
                Sample concentrations were predicted using the run calibration curve, as well as the master
   curve in GraphPrism. Within-run, within-day, day-to-day and total precision were calculated by
   ANOVA using MiniTab 15.
                Data predicted using the Run Calibration method showed total imprecision < 25%CV across a
35 tacrolimus concentration range from           3 - 210 ng/ml.

               Analytical sensitivity was calculated by the 2SD method. The standard deviation of 18
   replicates of the 0 calibrator was determined. The tacrolimus level at the maximum T2 (top
   asymptote of the curve fit) - 2SD was then calculated and the concentration predicted using the
   Master Calibration Curve. Analytical sensitivity is 0.8 ng/ml.
 5             During tacrolimus antibody development and screening, antibody specificity was evaluated
   against five tacrolimus metabolites. ELISA inhibition was performed with each of the 5 metabolites
   and compared to free tacrolimus for five affinity matured clones and seven clones with additional
   affinity maturation by cross-cloning. Data for two of the cross-clones and a state-of-the-art murine
   monoclonal RUO antibody are shown below. The only cross-reactivity observed was slight reactivity
10 to the 15-0-desmethyl metabolite.
               A summary of the tacrolimus assay performance is tabulated below.

   Example 24. Preparation of nanoparticles for detection of nucleic acid analytes.
15             Preparation of single probe particles: 800 nm carboxylated iron oxide superparamagnetic
   particles, consisting of numerous iron oxide nanocrystals embedded in a polymer matrix including a
   total particle diameter of 800 nm (see Demas et al., New J. Phys. 13:1 (2011)) were washed using a
   magnetic rack prior to use. The magnetic particles were resusupended in 66 pL of nuclease-free
   water, 20 ptL of 250 mM MES buffer pH 6, and 4 ptL of aminated probe (obtained from IDT), at 1
20 mM concentration per mg of particle to be prepared. A 3' aminated probe particle and a 5' aminated
   probe particle were prepared (e.g., the probe for C. parapsilosis). The probe was added to the particle
   and the suspension was vortexed using a vortexer equipped with a foam holder to hold the tube. The
   vortexer was set to a speed that keeps the particles well-suspended without any splashing. N-ethyl
   N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) was then dissolved in water and
25 immediately added to the vortexing particle-probe mixture. The tube was then closed and incubated
   with rotation in an incubator at 37 'C for 2 hours. The tube was then placed in a magnetic rack and

   the reaction fluid was removed. The particles were washed with a series of washes (125 pL/mg
   particle) as follows: water, water, 0. IM imidazole, pH 6.0 with a 5 minute incubation with rotation at
   37 'C, water, 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 with a 5 minute incubation with rotation at 37 'C
   water. The particles were then subjected to a 1 hour heat-stress at 60-65 'C in 0. 1M sodium
 5 bicarbonate pH 8.0 with rotation. After the heat-stress, the bicarbonate was removed by placing the
   tube in a magnetic rack. The particles were then resuspended in the storage buffer (Tris-EDTA, 0.10%
   tween 20) and vortexed. The storage buffer was removed and a final 100 pl of storage buffer was
   added to the particle preparation. The particles were stored at 2-8 'C, qualified using an iron test to
   determine the iron concentration of the particles, and tested against target nucleic acid (e.g., C.
10 paraplsilosis ITS2 oligo titration). In the Candida assay, the particles are diluted in 8x SSPE
   supplemented with 0.09% sodium azide as a preservative.
                Preparation of dual probe particles: For the preparation of a dual probe particle, the
   procedure is the same as above, except that equal volumes of a second probe (e.g., 3' aminated C.
   albicans) and the first probe (e.g., 3'aminated C. tropicalis) were mixed prior to addition to the
15 magnetic particles. Similarly, equal volumes of the 5'aminated probes were mixed prior to addition
   to the magnetic particles.
   Example 25. Candida assay improvements.
                The limit of detection for the Candida assay of Example 22 was improved by washing the
20 pellet. 2.0 mL of whole blood was combined with 100 piL of TRAX erythrocyte lysis buffer (i.e., a
   mixture of nonyl phenoxy-polyethoxylethanol (NP-40) and 4-octylphenol polyethoxylate (Triton
   X100)) and incubated for about 5 minutes. The sample was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 6000g and
   the resulting supernatant was removed and discarded. To wash the pellet, the pellet was mixed with
   200 pL of Tris EDTA (TE) buffer pH 8.0 and subjected to vortexing. The sample was again
25 centrifuged for 5 minutes at 6000g and the resulting supernatant was removed and discarded.
   Following the wash step the pellet was mixed with 100 piL TE buffer and subjected to bead beating
   (e.g., such as with 0.5 mm glass beads, 0.1 mm silica beads, 0.7 mm silica beads, or a mixture of
   differently sized beads) with vigorous agitation. The sample was again centrifuged. Fifty piL of the
   resulting lysate was then added to 50 piL of an asymmetric PCR master mix containing a
30 deoxynucleotides, PCR primers and a whole blood compatible thermophilic DNA polymerase (T2
   Biosystems, Lexington, MA). Thermocycling and hybridization induced agglomeration assays were
   conducted as described in Example 22 to produce T2 values characteristic of the presence of Candida
   in the blood sample. The assay can produce (i) a coefficient of variation in the T2 value of less than
   20% on Candida positive samples; (ii) at least 95% correct detection at less than or equal to 5
35 cells/mL in samples spiked into 50 individual healthy patient blood samples; (iii) at least 95% correct

   detection less than or equal to 5 cells/mL in samples spiked into 50 indiviudal unhealthy patient blood
   samples; and/or (iv) greater than or equal to 80% correct detection in clinically positive patient
   samples (i.e., Candida positive by another technique, such as by cell culture) starting with 2mL of
   blood.
