                             UNDERWATER MODULAR BARRIER
    TECHNICAL FIELD
    [0001] The present invention relates to barrier
    [0002] The invention has been devised particularly, although not necessarily solely, in
  5 relation to shark barriers.
    BACKGROUND ART
    [0003] The following discussion of the background art is intended to facilitate an
    understanding of the present invention only. The discussion is not an acknowledgement
    or admission that any of the material referred to is or was part of the common general
 10 knowledge as at the priority date of the application.
    [0004] When swimming in the ocean in open water, there is always the risk of being
    attacked by a shark. Given a significant number of shark attacks in Australian waters in
    recent years, there is an increasing need to assess the options available for reducing
    this risk.
 15 [0005] Barriers provided around areas of beaches to limit access by sharks have been
    employed in certain locations. These barriers have generally comprised netting
    extended around the swimming areas. Such shark nets however have a number of
    disadvantages.
    [0006] Firstly, while flexible rope netting can reduce the likelihood of sharks entering the
20  area, it also poses a danger to both the sharks and other marine life. Many sea
    creatures are killed due to being caught in the netting and being unable to escape.
    Further, flexible rope type netting can also be damaged and requires regular
    maintenance to ensure holes don't develop which would reduce its effectiveness.
    [0007] Moreover, typically shark barrier need to be relative strong to sustain any
25  damage due to possible contact with sharks. However, any shark barrier needs to be
    relatively flexible allowing the barrier to contract, expand and bend to account for tidal
    changes.
                                                 1

    [0008] Further, on occasions it may be desired that the barrier be removed. For
    example, the barrier may be removed during seasons where there are low numbers of
    sharks or one at all or the sharks have migrated to other regions. And, thus, the
    shorelines are save to use with a shark barrier.
  5 [0009] Also, the barriers may need to be removed to allow access from the coast to the
    open sea or vice versa. For example, the barrier may need to be removed during water
    sport events. Typically, removal of barriers such as a rope netting is time consuming
    and cumbersome.
    [0010] It is against this background that the present invention has been developed.

    DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
    [0047] Referring to the Figure 1, there is shown a barrier 10 comprising a plurality of
    pylons 12 and a mesh 14. The mesh 14 spans from one of the pylons 12a to the other
 10 pylon 12b and extends form the upper portion of the pylons 12 to the lower portion of
    the pylons 12. In this manner, the barrier 10 is defined which impedes marine life such
    as sharks to enter a particular area of the shore line. This arrangement impedes the
    shark traversing the space located between the pylons 12.
    [0048] Figure 2 shows a second embodiment of the present invention. This particular
 15 embodiment includes also a plurality of pylons 12 with a mesh 14 spanning between the
    pylons 12. In this particular embodiment, the mesh 14 is adapted to curve. The fact that
    the mesh 14 is adapted to curve is particularly advantageous because it allows the
    mesh to adjust to the movements of the water when the mesh 14 is deployed in the
    water.
20  [0049] Figure 3 shows a third embodiment of the present invention. This particular
    embodiment includes also a plurality of pylons 12 with a mesh 14 spanning between the
    pylons 12. In this particular embodiment, the mesh 14 is adapted to be selectively
    displaced between an extended condition and a contracted condition. The fact that the
    mesh 14 is adapted be selectively displaced between an extended condition and a
25  contracted condition is particularly advantageous because it allows to locate the mesh
    in the contracted condition if access through the pylons 12 is desired. Access through
    the pylons 12 is impeded after returning the mesh 14 to the extended condition.
    Furthermore, the mesh 14 in accordance with this particular embodiment is adapted to
    move parallel to the longitudinal axis of the pylons. This is particularly useful because it
30  allows for the barrier to adjust the location of the mesh along the pylons 12 to account
    for the low and high tide.
                                                8

    [0050] We refer now to the barrier 10 in accordance with a first embodiment of the
    invention that is shown in figure 1.
    [0051] In the particular arrangement of the barrier 10 shown in figure 1 each side of the
    mesh 14 is attached to a pylon 12. For this each side of the mesh 14 comprises
  5 connectors 15. The connecters 15 are spaced apart with respect to each other along
    the longitudinal axis of the pylons 12. This allows maintaining the mesh 14 between the
    pylons 12.
    [0052] Further, the barrier includes a rope 16 that extends from an upper portion of one
    of the pylons 12a to an upper portion of other pylon 12b. The rope 16 supports the
 10 mesh 14 in the extended condition. For this, the upper portion of the mesh 14 is
    attached to the rope 16 via connectors 18.
    [0053] Furthermore, the barrier 10 includes a chain 20 that extends from a lower portion
    of one of the pylons 12a to a lower portion of other pylon 12b. The chain 20 supports
    the mesh 14 between the lower portions of the pylons 12. For this, the lower portion of
 15 the mesh 14 is attached to the rope 16 via connecting means 66 - see figures 17 to 19.
    [0054] The mesh 14 shown in figure 1 comprises a plurality of modules 22. The modules
    22 are connected to each other defining the mesh 14. The modules 22 are secured
    together by connectors 24 to form a net like structure defining the mesh 14.
    [0055]    In the particular arrangement shown in figure 1, the modules 22 are configured
 ?0 as rings. However, in accordance with any embodiment of the present invention, the
    modules 22 may be configured to have any type of shape. For example, figures 7 and 8
    show alternative arrangements of the modules 22. Figure 7 shows a module configured
    as a diamond shape body 22. Figure 8 shows a module configured as a square shape
    body 22.
25  [0056] Figures 4 and 5 show a section of a mesh 14 including the ring shaped modules
    22. The ring shaped modules 22 are attached to each other via connections 23. In a
    particular arrangement, the connections 23 are adapted to permit pivotal movement
    between the modules 22. This is particular advantageous because it allows for the
    mesh to adjust to water movements and tidal changes.
30  [0057] In particular, figure 5 shows a mesh 14 comprising a first sheet 21 defined by
    modules 22a and a second sheet 25 defined by modules 22b. The second sheet 25
                                               9

    being located adjacent and offset to the first sheet 21. The modules 22a and 22b of the
    sheet 21 and the sheet 25 are joined together via the connections 23 which also join
    together the first and second sheet 21 and 25.
    [0058] Each of the ring shaped modules 22 may be formed of a generally rigid material.
  5 The ring shaped modules 22 are each formed of a material such that the ring shaped
    modules 22 are sufficiently rigid to retain a circular shape but may include some
    flexibility.
    [0059] The ring shaped modules 22 may be formed from tyre beads. That is, the ring
    shaped modules 22 each comprise the bead portion of a discarded tyre separated from
 10 the tyre by cutting. Each ring shaped modules 22 therefore comprises a metallic ring
    coated by a rubber material. Each discarded tyre may therefore provide a pair of ring
    shaped modules 22 for use in the barrier 10. With such a construction, the barrier 10
    can be formed of material which would otherwise need disposal and the barrier 10 can
    therefore be produced relatively inexpensively
 15 [0060] Referring now to figures 7 and 8. In an arrangement the diamond shaped module
    22 may comprise a plurality of bars 24 connected to each other so as to define a body
    of any shape and surround a void area to allow fluid flow traverse the area. In
    alternative arrangements the modules may be defined by bars 24 connected to each
    other such that the bars 24 do not enclose an area.
 ?0 [0061] Furthermore, in a further alternative arrangement the modules 22 may include
    within the area enclosed by the bars 24 second bars (not shown) - extending between
    the bars 24 - to provide, for example, support to the modules 22.
    [0062] As mentioned above, the modules 22 are adapted to be joined together. For this
    the modules 22 comprise female connectors 26 and male connectors 28 adapted to be
25  attached together to define a first joint 30 - see figures 9 to 11. In the particular
    arrangement shown in the figures 6 to 8, the modules 22 comprises a plurality of the
    connectors 26 and 28 spaced apart with respect to each other. The connectors 26 and
    28 are arranged in such a manner that the upper and lower side of each module 22
    comprises connectors 26a and each side of the modules 22 comprise connectors 26b
30  and 28b.
    [0063] We refer now to figure 12. Figure 12 shows a schematic perspective view of a
    section of a barrier 10 according to a second embodiment of the invention. The barrier
                                              10

    10 according to the second embodiment is similar to the barrier 10 according to the
    barrier 10 of the first embodiment and similar reference numerals are used to identify
    similar parts. In this second embodiment of the invention, the modules 22 are adapted
    to be pivotally joined together. As will be explained with reference to the method of
  5 operation of the barrier 10 the fact that the modules 22 are adapted to be pivotally
    joined together is particularly advantageous because it allows the barrier 10 to adjust to
    account for the movement of the water contained in the body of water in which the
    barrier 10 is immersed or partially immersed.
    [0064]The mesh 14 depicted in figure 12, comprises a plurality of modules 22
 10 configured as a diamond shaped body. In the particular arrangement, shown in figure
    12, the mesh 14 comprises a first section 14a and a second section 14b. The sections
    14a and 14b are joined together via pivoting joints 32. As shown in figure 12, each of
    the outermost modules 22a and 22b of each section 14a and 14b are joined together by
    a pivoting joint 32. In this manner, a column is defined between the sections 14a and
 15 14b. The column comprises a plurality pivoting joints 32 that extend from the upper
    portion of the mesh 14 to the lower portion of the mesh 14. The fact that the sections
    14a and 14b of the mesh are pivotally joined together is particular advantageous
    because it allows the mesh 14 to curve along the transversal direction of the mesh as is,
    for example, shown in figure 2. This allows the mesh 14 to adjust to movements of the
 ?0 water of the body of water in which the barrier 10 is immersed.
    [0065] Figure 13 show a particular arrangement of the pivoting joint 32. The pivoting
    joint 32 comprises a female connector 34 and a male connector 36. The female and
    male connectors 34 and 36 are joined together via a rivet 38 allowing the pivoting joint
    32to pivot.
25  [0066] Each of the female and male connectors 34 and 36 comprise a ring member 40.
    To connect the female and male connectors 34 and 36 together the ring members 40
    are joined together in such manner that the rivet 38 traverses simultaneously both ring
    members 40 - see figure 13. This allows forming the pivoting joint 32.
    [0067] The pivoting joint 32 is attached to the modules 22 located adjacent to each other
30  by fastening the pivoting joint 32 to the connectors 26 and 28 of the modules 22. As
    shown in figure 13 and 15, the female connector 34 is attached to the male connector
    28 of the module 22a. Similarly, the male connector 36 is attached to the female
    connector 26 of the module 22b.
                                               11

    [0068]     In the particular arrangement shown in figure 12, the mesh 14 comprises a pair
    of sections 14a and 14b. However, in alternative arrangements, the mesh 14 may
    comprise more than two sections 14a and 14b joined together by pivoting joints 32.
    [0069] In further alternative arrangements, each of the modules may be attached to
  5 each other via pivoting joints 32. For example, in a particular arrangement, each side of
    a module 22 may be pivotally joined together to its neighbouring module 22 via pivoting
    joint 32.
    [0070] Furthermore, the upper and lower ends of the each module 22 may be pivotally
    attached to the upper and lower ends of a further module 22 located adjacent to the
 10 each module 22. This allows for curving of the mesh along the longitudinal direction of
    the mesh 14. And, as will be described with reference to the third embodiment of the
    invention, this particular arrangement of the invention is particularly advantageous
    because in some particular arrangements of the barrier it allows the mesh 14 to be
    selectively displaced between an extended condition and a contracted condition.
 15 [0071] We refer now to figures 20 to 29. These figures relate to a barrier 10 according to
    the third embodiment of the invention. The third embodiment is similar to the barrier 10
    according to the barrier 10 of the first and second embodiments and similar reference
    numerals are used to identify similar parts. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, in
    this third embodiment of the invention, the modules 22 are adapted to be pivotally joined
 ?0 together to allow the mesh to be selectively displaced between an extended condition
    and a contracted condition. The fact that the mesh 14 is adapted to be selectively
    displaced between an extended condition and a contracted condition is particularly
    advantageous because it allows locating the mesh 14 in the contracted condition to
    permit access to the particular area of the shore line which access was impeded due to
25  deployment of the mesh 14. By returning the mesh 14 to the extended condition access
    to the particular area of the shore line may be impeded again.
    [0072] Figures 20 and 21 show a particular arrangement of a section of the mesh 14 in
    accordance with a third embodiment of the invention. In this particular arrangement of
    this embodiment of the invention, the mesh comprises a plurality of rows 42a, 42b and
30  42c. Each row 42 comprises a plurality of modules 22 arranged side by side
    transversally along the mesh 14. The rows 42 are arranged adjacent to each other
    longitudinally along the mesh 14. The rows 42 are joined together via ropes 44. The
    ropes 44 extend from one side of the mesh 14 to the other side of the mesh.
                                               12

    [0073] The modules 22 are pivotally attached to the ropes 44. For this, the modules 22
    comprise connectors 46. The connectors 46 comprise ring members 48 adapted to
    receive the rope 44. This arrangement allows pivotally attaching adjacent rows 42 to
    each other. In this manner, the mesh 14 may be selectively displaced between the
  5 extended condition and the contracted condition.
    [0074] As shown in figure 20, when the mesh is assembled, the ring member 40 of each
    module 22 of a particular row 42a is located side by side of the ring member 40 of each
    module of the particular row 42b that is located adjacent to the lower portion of the row
    42a. The same applies to the connection of row 42b and 42c. Figure 20 shows a
 10 particular section of the mesh 14 in accordance with a third embodiment of the
    invention; thus, a mesh 14 in accordance with a third embodiment of the invention may
    include more than three rows 42a, 42b and 42c - each of the adjacent rows 42 being
    pivotally attached to each other.
    [0075] Referring now to figure 22, figure 22 shows the pivot connection 45 of two
 15 modules 22a and 22b.        In particular, figure 22 shows the pivot connection 45 of the
    outermost modules of the mesh 14. As shown the ring members 48 are located side by
    side to allow the rope 44 to traverse both ring members 48a and 48b. This particular
    arrangement allows for pivotal movement between adjacent modules 22a and 22b - see
    figure 23.
 ?0 [0076] We refer now to the figures 25 and 26. As mentioned before, the mesh 14 spans
    between pylons 12a and 12b defining the barrier 10. Figures 25 and 26 show a section
    of the barrier 10. In particular, in figures 25 and 26 depict the left portion of a barrier 10
    in accordance with the third embodiment of the invention and as shown, for example, in
    figure 3. As shown in figure 24, the mesh 14 comprises a plurality of rows of modules
25  22. As mentioned before figures 25 and 26 are schematic views of a section of the
    barrier 10 - in particular, figures 25 and 26 depict a section of the mesh having three
    rows of modules 22; each row having two modules 22. However, the mesh 14 may
    include a plurality of row extending from an upper portion of the pylon 12 to a lower
    portion of the pylon 12. Also, the barrier 10 may include a plurality of modules 22
30  extending from the pylon 12a to the other pylon 12b.
    [0077] As shown in the particular arrangement depicted in figure 24, the mesh 14 is
    attached to the pylons 12 via sliding rings 50. In the arrangement shown in figures 25
    and 26 there are provided an upper sliding ring 50a. To the sliding ring 50a is attached
                                                  13

    the rope 16. The sliding ring 50a is adapted to be releasably attached to the pylon 12.
    In this manner, the sliding ring 50a may be fastened to the pylon 12 in order to maintain
    the mesh 14 in the extended condition. For locating the mesh 14 in the contracted
    condition the sliding ring 50a may be detached from the pylon 12a to allow the ring 50a
  5 to slide along the longitudinal axis of the pylon together with the remaining rings 50. In
    this manner, the mesh 14 may be located in the contracted condition.
    [0078] However, in a particular arrangement, the sliding ring 50a may be attached to the
    pylon 12 in such a manner that the sliding ring 50a may be displaced due to tidal
    changes. For example, the sliding ring may be allowed to slide a specific distance along
 10 the pylon 12. This is accomplished by setting upper and lower means for stopping the
    sliding ring 50a. This is particularly advantageous because it allows to account for these
    tidal changes.
    [0079] The lower means for stopping the sliding ring 50a may be adapted to allow the
    sliding ring 50a to travel beyond the lower stopping means to allow the sliding ring 50a
 15 to descent longitudinally along the pylon 12 during contraction of the mesh 14.
    [0080] Referring back to the mesh 14, as mentioned before each module 22 is pivotally
    attached to its adjacent module (upper and lower modules 22) via pivot connections 45
    - see figures 20 to 23 except for the upper most row of modules 22 and the lowermost
    row of modules 22. The modules 22 of the uppermost row are pivotally attached to the
 ?0 rope 16 through, for example, rings 40 of connecting members 34 or 36. The modules
    22 of the lowermost row are pivotally attached to the chain 30 through, for example,
    rings 40 of connecting members 34 or 36 - see figures 12 and 18.
    [0081] As was described before, the mesh 14 is adapted to be selectively displaced
    between the extended condition and the contracted condition. For this, the rope 16 and
25  a group of ropes 44b are attached each to a sliding ring 50 and another group of ropes
    44a that are not attached to a sliding ring 50. This arrangement allows for the mesh 14
    to be selectively displaced between the extended condition and the contracted
    condition.
    [0082] In the particular arrangement shown in figure 24, the ropes 44b that are attached
30  to the sliding ring 50 are selected such that two rows of modules 22 are located
    between two ropes 44b that are attached to the sliding ring. In this manner, one rope
                                                14

    44a that is not attached to the sliding ring 50 is located between two ropes 44b that are
    attached to a sliding ring 50.
    [0083] Further, the barrier 10 comprises a rope 52 that extends adjacent and
    longitudinally to the pylon 12. The modules 22 of the outermost column are slideably
  5 attached to the rope 52 to maintain the sides of the mesh 14 close to the pylon. The
    rope 52 comprises a flexible rope 50 that extends selectively between an contracted
    condition (when the mesh 14 is in the extended condition) and an extended condition
    (when the mesh 14 is in the contracted condition)
    [0084] In a particular arrangement, the modules 22 of the outermost columns defining
 10 the sides of the mesh 14 may be slideably attached to the rope 52 via the connecting
    members 34 or 36 - see figures 16 and 17. As discussed, the connecting members 34
    and 36 comprise ring members 40 that can be traversed by the rope 52.
    [0085] Figure 25, shows a schematic view of one of the sliding ring 50. In this particular
    arrangement the sliding ring 50 incorporates a plurality of rollers 54 that are arranged in
 15 a spaced apart relationship around the sliding ring 50. The rollers 54 facilitate sliding of
    the ring 50 longitudinally along the pylon 12.
    [0086] Further, figures 28 and 29 show an alternative arrangement of pylon 12 adapted
    to allow selective displacement of the mesh 14 between the extended condition and the
    contracted condition. In particular, figure 26 shows a pylon 12 incorporating a bar 56
 ?0 that extends outward from the pylon 12. The bar 56 is adapted to receive the rings 40 of
    the connecting members 34 or 36 of the modules 22 in such a manner that the rings 40
    may slide longitudinally along the bar 56 during the process of extending or contracting
    of the mesh 14. Figure 27 shows a pylon 12 incorporating a channel 58 that extends
    longitudinally along the pylon 12. The bar 56 is adapted to receive guides 62 (that are
25  attached to the modules 22) in such a manner that the guides 62 may slide
    longitudinally along the bar 56 during the process of extending or contracting of the
    mesh 14.
    [0087] Referring now back to figure 12. The barrier 10 is secured to the seabed via
    chains 62. In the particular arrangement shown in figure 12 there are two chains 62
30  spaced with respect to each other.
    [0088] The chains 62 rest on the seabed extending perpendicularly to the mesh 14. The
    chains 62 comprise, at each end, anchors 64 to maintain the chains 62 attached to the
                                                15

    seabed. The chain 20 may be fastened to the chain 62 to secure the mesh 14 to the
    chain 62.
    [0089] The lowermost row of modules 22a is attached to the chain 20. In the particular
    arrangement shown in the figures a particular module 22 is attached to the chain 20.
  5 However, in alternative arrangements, each of the modules 22 of the lowermost row of
    the mesh structure 11 may be attached to the chain 20 via connecting means 66.
    [0090] Figures 18 and 19 show the connecting means 66. As shown in figure 18, the
    connecting means 66 comprise a loop member 68. The loop member 68 is adapted to
    be selectively closed and opened to allow fastening of the loop member to the chain 20
 10 and to allow the connecting member 34 or 36 to be attached to the loop member 68 via
    its ring member 40.
    [0091] It is evident that the present embodiments of the invention provide an effective
    and useful barrier 10 for, for example, marine life such as sharks.
    [0092] The barrier 10 may be assembled by locating pylons 12 in the seabed spaced
 15 apart with respect to each other to allow the mesh 14 extend between the pylons 12.
    The lower chain 20 and the upper rope 16 may be extended between the pylons 12.
    [0093] Once, the pylons 12 are set in the seabed, the assembly of the mesh 14 may
    proceed. It is expected that the mesh 14 will be assembled, for example, on a barge in
    the location where the barrier 10 is to be placed. The modules 22 can be joined together
 ?0 by connecting the respective connecting members 26 and 28. The modules 22 are
    joined together in such a manner so as to define the shape of the mesh that is required.
    After having connected the modules 22 together, the connecting members 34 or 36
    (incorporating the rings 40) may be attached to the connecting members 26 or 28 of the
    modules 22 of the uppermost and lower most row of modules 22 and the outermost side
25  columns of modules 22 of the mesh 14.
    [0094] In particular, connecting members 34 or 36 (incorporating the rings 40) are
    connected to the connecting member 26 or 28 of each module 22 of the uppermost row
    of modules 22. This allows for fastening the mesh 14 to the rope 16 which allows
    maintaining the mesh 14 in the extended condition.
30  [0095] Further, connecting members 34 or 36 (incorporating the rings 40) are connected
    to the connecting member 26 or 28 of each module 22 of the outermost columns of the
                                               16

    mesh 14. This allows fastening the sides of the modules 22 to the pylons 12. In the
    particular arrangement described with reference to the third embodiment, the rings 40 of
    the connecting members 34 or 36 will be attached to either (1) the sliding rings 50 or (2)
    the rope 52 that maintains the side of the mesh 14 close to the pylon 12. Further,
  5 connecting members 34 or 36 (incorporating the rings 40) are connected to the
    connecting members 26 or 28 of the respective modules 22 of the lowermost row of the
    mesh 14 that will be connected via the connecting means 66 to the chain 20.
    [0096] After the assembly process of the mesh 14 has been completed the mesh 14 is
    lowered into place from the barge. At the location, the mesh 14 is connected to the
 10 pylons 12, upper rope 16 and lower chain 20 as was previously described in order to
    define the barrier 10 and impede access to the particular location.
    [0097] The barrier 10 may extend along a portion of shoreline parallel to the shore and
    also have end portions that extend inwardly to the shore to define a completely
    enclosed area.
 15 [0098]    The size of the modules 22 will impede relative large marine life, such as
    sharks, access to the particular area of the shoreline while allowing smaller marine life
    to simply swim through the modules 22 of the mesh 14. The particular construction of
    the mesh 14 may limit any entanglement of marine life.
    [0099] And, as described with reference to the present embodiment of the invention
 ?0 mesh 14 is adapted to accommodate tidal changes and movement of the water in view
    that, for example, the modules 22 may be pivotally attached to each other and the mesh
    may slide along the longitudinal axis of the pylons. The mesh 14 may also be selectively
    displaced between an extended condition and contracted condition.
    [00100]        Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the
25  word "comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to
    imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any
    other integer or group of integers
                                               17
