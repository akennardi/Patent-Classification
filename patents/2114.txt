Field
[0001] The present invention relates to a power socket assembly.
Background
[0002] Power socket assemblies comprising one or more power sockets are known and mounting
arrangements for mounting of such power socket assemblies to a support surface, such as a wall,
are also known. Typically, the mounting arrangements of known power socket assemblies are
simply designed to fix or secure the power socket assembly to the support surface.
Summary of Invention
[0003] It is an object of the present invention to overcome or at least ameliorate one or more
disadvantages of known power socket assemblies or at least provide a useful alternative.
[0004] The present invention provides a power socket assembly comprising: a socket body
having at least one power socket; and a bracket for mounting the socket body to a support
surface, the bracket having coupling means for rotatably coupling the socket body to the bracket.
The coupling means is configured such that the socket body is rotatable with respect to the
bracket through an angle of 360 degrees about an axis of rotation. In other words, when the
socket body is coupled to the bracket, the socket body is rotatable with respect to the bracket
through an angle of 360 degrees about an axis of rotation.
[0005] In a preferred form, the socket body comprises at least one complementary coupling
means configured to engage and couple with the coupling means of the bracket. Preferably, the
socket body comprises complementary coupling means associated with each respective power
socket. Thus, where the socket body comprises a plurality of power sockets, multiple coupling
configurations with the bracket may be possible.
[0006] In a preferred form, the coupling means of the bracket comprise one or more first
coupling elements and the complementary coupling means of the socket body comprise one or
more second coupling elements. The one or more first coupling elements may comprise a male

                                                 2

coupling configured to receive and engage with the male coupling element. Alternatively, the
one or more second coupling elements may comprise the male coupling element, and the one or
more first coupling elements may comprise the female coupling.
[0007] In a preferred form, the bracket comprises a plate member and the one or more first
coupling elements project from a surface of the plate member for engagement with the one or
more second coupling elements of the socket body.
[0008] In a preferred form, the one or more first coupling elements comprise a ring-like flange
member projecting from the surface of the plate member.
[0009] In a preferred form, the one or more first coupling elements comprise a first screw thread.
The first screw thread is preferably formed in the ring-like flange member of the bracket.
[0010] In a preferred form, the socket body comprises a casing which at least partially encloses
and/or houses the at least one power socket. The one or more second coupling elements of the
socket body for engagement with the first coupling element(s) of the bracket are preferably
formed or provided in or on the casing. The casing may optionally be formed of a first part and a
second part which are connected to each other to assemble the casing.
[0011] In a preferred form, the one or more second coupling elements comprise a second screw
thread for threaded engagement with the first screw thread.
[0012] In a preferred form, the one or more first coupling elements are formed integrally with
bracket and/or the one or more second coupling elements are formed integrally with the socket
body.
[0013] In a preferred form, the bracket comprises attachment means configured to connect the
bracket to the support surface.
[0014] In a preferred form, the attachment means comprises at least one hole, the at least one
hole configured to receive a fastener there-through to fasten the bracket to the support surface.
The at least one hole may, for example, be formed through the plate member of the bracket.

                                                 3
[0015] In a preferred form, the attachment means comprises an adhesive element to adhesively
attach the bracket to the support surface. The adhesive element may, for example, comprise a
double-sided adhesive tape.
[0016] In a preferred form, the socket body comprises a plurality of power sockets. In this
regard, the casing of the socket body may at least partially enclose and/or house a plurality of
power sockets. Preferably, each power socket is arranged at a respective side or face of the
socket body.
[0017] In a preferred form, the socket body may further comprise at least one USB socket or
USB port. In this regard, the USB socket or port is arranged at a side or face of the socket body.
[0018] In a preferred form, the socket body has a substantially cuboid or spheroid shape, and
each power socket is arranged at a respective side or face of the socket body.
[0019] In a preferred form, the power socket assembly further comprises an electrical cable
connected to the socket body and coupled to each power socket, the electrical cable configured
to be removably coupled to an electrical power source.

Description of Embodiments
[0027] Figure 1 shows a power socket assembly 100 according to a first embodiment of the
present invention having a socket body 10 and a bracket 20. The bracket 20 is configured to
mount the socket body 10 to a support surface (not shown) such as a wall, desk, shelves, or the
like. The socket body 10 and the bracket 20 are configured to rotatably couple to each other.
When the socket body 10 is coupled to the bracket 20, the socket body 10 is rotatable with
respect to the bracket 20 through an angle of 360 degrees about an axis of rotation 1.
[0028] The socket body 10 comprises a casing 11 and four power sockets 12. The casing 11 has
a substantially cuboid shape and is formed of a first part 13a and a second part 13b. The first
part 13a and the second part 13b are connected to each other to assemble the casing 11. Although
the power socket assembly 100 is described as having four power sockets 12, it is envisaged that
the power socket assembly 100 need only have at least one power socket 12, or could have more
than four power sockets 12. It is also envisaged that one or more of the faces of the socket body
10 may include at least one USB port (not illustrated), except faces 15 and 16.
[0029] The casing 11 defines four openings 14 on each face of the socket body 10, except for
faces 15 and 16. Each power socket 12 is partially or substantially enclosed and/or housed in the
casing 11 such that the socket face 17 of each power socket 12 is exposed at or through a
respective one of the openings 14.
[0030] Referring to Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings, a coupling means 18 is formed around each
of the openings 14. The coupling means 18 may comprise one or more coupling elements,
which in the figures is represented as an integrally formed internal screw thread 19. In this way,
the internal screw thread 19 forms a female coupling element. It will be appreciated that the
coupling means 18 may be integrally formed in the casing 11 around the periphery of the
opening 14, or it may be a separate component applied to the socket body 11.

                                                     5
[0031] An electrical cable (not shown) is connected to the socket body 10 at the face 15 of the
casing 11 and is in electrically conductive connection with each of the power sockets 12 within
the casing 11. The electrical cable extends out of the casing 11 through aperture 9. The
electrical cable typically has a plug at its distal end, such that it is configured to be removably
coupled to an electrical power source such as, for example, mains AC power outlet.
[0032] Referring to Figure 3, the bracket 20 comprises a plate member 21 and a ring-like flange
member 22. The plate member 21 is generally circular in the form a disc and the ring-like flange
member 22 projects from a front surface 23 of the plate member 21. Referring to Figure 4, the
bracket 20 comprises a coupling means 24 for engaging and coupling with any one of the
complementary coupling means 18 provided in or on socket body 10. The coupling means 24
comprises one or more coupling elements, which in the embodiment shown in the figures
includes the ring-like flange member 22 and an integrally formed external screw thread 25. In
this way, the ring-like flange member 22 and integrally formed external screw thread 25 form
male coupling elements. It will be appreciated that the external screw thread may be integrally
formed in an outer surface of the ring-like flange member 22 or may be formed on a separate
component applied to the ring-like flange member 22.
[0033] The coupling means 18 and the coupling means 24 are complementary and are
configured to engage each other to removably and rotatably couple the socket body 10 to the
bracket 20. The coupling means 18 and the coupling means 24 allow the socket body 10, when
coupled to the bracket 20, to rotate with respect to the bracket 20 through an angle of 360
degrees about the axis of rotation 1 (see Figure 1).
[0034] Referring to Figures 3 and 4, the bracket 20 further comprises attachment means to
connect the bracket 20 to a support surface. The attachment means comprises holes 26a, 26b
and/or an adhesive element (not shown). The holes 26a, 26b are formed through the plate
member 21 and are configured to receive a fastener (e.g. screws, nails, etc.) there-through to
fasten the bracket to the support surface. The adhesive element (not shown) is applied to a rear
surface 27 of the bracket 20 to adhesively attach the bracket 20 to the support surface. The
adhesive element may be a double-sided tape or any other suitable means known in the art.
[0035] Mounting of the socket body 10 to a support surface will now be described with reference
to Figures 5a and 5b. The bracket 20 is attached to the support surface in the desired location by

                                                   6
the adhesive element. After the bracket is adhesively attached to the support surface, fasteners
are passed through a respective one of the holes 26a, 26b to engage and fasten the bracket 20 to
the support surface. In this regard, although the bracket 20 is described as being connected to the
support surface using both the adhesive element and the holes 26a, 26b, it will be appreciated
that the bracket 20 may be connected to the support surface using only the adhesive element or
one or more fasteners via the holes 26a, 26b.
[0036] Referring to Figure 5a, after the bracket 20 has been connected to the support surface, the
socket body 10 is moved in a direction generally indicated by arrow 2 towards the bracket 20
until the coupling means 24 of the bracket 20 abuts the complementary coupling means 18
provided at one of the openings 14. Referring to Figure 5b, when the coupling means 24 abuts
the complementary coupling means 18, the socket body 10 is rotated in a direction generally
indicated by arrow 3 about the axis of rotation 1, such that the screw threads 19, 25 engage for
thereby coupling the socket body 10 to the bracket 20. The socket body 10 is rotatable, and can
be moved to a range of positions through an angle of over 360 degrees, between a fully engaged
position where the socket body 10 is securely fixed relative to and the bracket 20 via the
coupling means 18, 24 (see Figure 1), and a fully disengaged position where the socket body 10
is fully separated from and the bracket 10 because the coupling means 18, 24 are no longer
engaged with one another (see Figure 5a). It will be appreciated that decoupling the socket body
10 from the bracket 20 is achieved by rotating the socket body 10 relative to the bracket 20 in a
direction opposite to that as indicated by arrow 3.
[0037] As each opening 14 in the casing 11 has a respective coupling means 18, it will be
appreciated that the socket body 10 can be removably and rotatably coupled to the bracket 20 by
any one of the coupling means 18. In other words, multiple coupling configurations between the
socket body 10 and the bracket 20 may be possible.
[0038] When the socket body 10 is coupled to the bracket 20, the socket body 10 can be rotated
with respect to the bracket 20 through an angle of more than 360 degrees about the axis of
rotation 1. In this way, it will be appreciated that, when the socket body 10 is coupled to the
bracket 20, the power sockets 12 may be located in any position about the axis of rotation 1.
[0039] Figures 6a and 6b show a first part 13a' and a second part 13b' that could be used instead
of the first part 13a and the second part 13b to form the casing 11 of the socket body 10.

                                                  7
[0040] It will be appreciated that the present invention allows the power sockets 12 to be easily
located in any position around the axis of rotation 1 while the socket body 10 is mounted to a
support surface by the bracket 20. It will also be appreciated that the present invention allows
the socket body 10 to be easily mounted to and demounted from the support surface by the
bracket 20.
[0041] Although the power socket assemblies have been described with reference to preferred
embodiments, it will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the invention may be
embodied in many other forms.
