           This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.
   61/442,710, filed February 14, 2011. The complete disclosure of this provisional
   application is hereby incorporated by reference herein.
 5                                      BACKGROUND
           Magazines, catalogs, and other paper products that contain high levels of coatings,
   pigments, and inks, are widely available as waste materials. While efforts are made to
   recycle this waste paper, generally by repulping it for use in recycled paper products, it
   would be advantageous if this waste paper could be economically utilized as a feedstock
10 to make other types of products.
                                           SUMMARY
           Generally, this invention relates to methods of processing paper feedstocks, and to
   intermediates and products made therefrom. In particular, the invention relates generally
   to the processing of certain types of relatively heavy paper feedstocks, such as highly
15 pigmented papers, and or loaded papers, such as paper that has been color printed
   (printed with colors other than or in addition to black), e.g., magazines, and other papers.
           Many of the methods disclosed herein utilize microorganisms or products
   produced by microorganisms, e.g., enzymes, to bioprocess the feedstock, producing
   useful intermediates and products, e.g., energy, fuels, foods and other materials. For
20 example, in some cases enzymes are used to saccharify the feedstocks, converting the
   feedstocks to sugars. The sugars may be used as an end product or intermediate, or
   processed further, e.g., by fermentation. For example xylose can be hydrogenated to
   xylitol and glucose can be hydrogenated to sorbitol.
           In one aspect, the invention features methods for producing a sugar, e.g., in the
25 form of a solution or suspension, that includes providing a paper feedstock, the paper
   feedstock including offset printing paper e.g., offset printed paper, colored paper and/or
                                                  1

    WO 2012/112488                                                                PCT/US2012/024970
   coated paper e.g., polycoated paper and optionally mixing the feedstock with a fluid
   and/or saccharifying agent.
            Some implementations include one or more of the following features. The paper
   feedstock may have a basis weight greater than 35 lb, e.g., from about 35 lb to 330 lb
 5 and/or the paper may have a high filler content, e.g., greater than about 10 wt.% e.g.,
   greater than 20 wt.%. For example, the filler or any coating can be an inorganic material.
   The paper may also have a high grammage, e.g., greater than about 500 g/m 2 . The paper
   may comprise a pigment or printing ink, e.g., at a level greater than about 0.025 wt.%.
   The paper can have an ash content greater than about 8 wt.%.
10          The method can further include adding a microorganism, for example a yeast
   and/or a bacteria (e.g., from the genus Clostridium),to the paper feedstock or
   saccharified paper and producing a product or intermediate.
            The product can be a fuel, including, for example, alcohols (e.g., methanol,
   ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, erythritol, n-butanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, tert
15 butanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,4-butane diol and/or glycerin), sugar
   alcohols (e.g., erythritol, glycol, glycerol, sorbitol threitol, arabitol, ribitol, mannitol,
   dulcitol, fucitol, iditol, isomalt, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol and other polyols), organic acids
   (e.g., formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, caproic acid,
   palmitic acid, stearic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, oleic
20 acid, linoleic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid and/or y-hydroxybutyric acid), hydrocarbons
   (methane, ethane, propane, isobutene, pentane, n-hexane, biodiesels and/or bio
   gasolines), hydrogen and mixtures of these.
            The method can further include adding a food-based nutrient source to the
   mixture, e.g., a nutrient source selected from the group consisting of grains, vegetables,
25 residues of grains, residues of vegetables, and mixtures thereof, for example wheat, oats,
   barley, soybeans, peas, legumes, potatoes, corn, rice bran, corn meal, wheat bran, and
   mixtures thereof. In such cases, the mixture can further include an enzyme system
   selected to release nutrients from the food-based nutrient source, e.g., a system
   comprising a protease and an amylase.
30          The method can include detoxifying the sugar solution or suspension. The method
   can include further processing the sugar, for example, by separating xylose and or
                                                     2

    WO 2012/112488                                                            PCT/US2012/024970
   glucose from the sugar. In some cases, the saccharification can be conducted at a pH of
   about 3.8 to 4.2. The mixture can further include a nitrogen source.
            In some cases, the method further includes physically treating the paper
   feedstock, for example mechanically treating to reduce the bulk density of the paper
 5 feedstock and/or increase the BET surface area of the feedstock. Physically treating the
   paper feedstock can include irradiation, for example, with an electron beam. The method
   can include mixing the paper feedstock with a fluid. The method can include detoxifying
   the paper feedstock, sugar, and/or other products or intermediates. The paper feedstock
   may be in the form of magazines. The paper feedstock may also be a laminate of at least
10 one layer of a polymer and paper and may further include at least one layer of a metal
   e.g., aluminum.
            Although many embodiments include the use of relatively heavy paper
   feedstocks, e.g., containing fillers and/or coatings other papers can be used e.g.,
   newsprint.

                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
            Using the methods and nutrient packages described herein, paper feedstocks that
   include high levels of pigments, colors, fillers and/or coatings, and/or that have a high
   basis weight, and the saccharified derivatives of such feedstocks, can be bioprocessed,
 5 e.g., using fermentation, to produce useful intermediates and products such as those
   described herein. In some cases, the feedstock includes high levels pigments and/or
   fillers such as those feedstocks used in printing, e.g., magazines. Examples of such
   feedstocks are described herein. Feedstocks of this type are advantageous for a number
   of reasons, including their relatively low cost (if waste materials are used) and, in the
10 case of high basis weight papers, their relatively high density, which contributes to ease
   of handling and processing.
   CONVERTING CELLULOSIC AND LIGNOCELLULOSIC
   MATERIALS TO ALCOHOLS
15
            Referring to FIG. 1, a process for manufacturing an alcohol, e.g., ethanol, or a
   butanol e.g., isobutanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol or n-butanol, can include, for example,
   optionally mechanically treating the feedstock (step 110), before and/or after this
   treatment, optionally treating the feedstock with another physical treatment, for example
20 irradiation, to further reduce its recalcitrance (step 112), saccharifying the feedstock to
   form a sugar solution (step 114), optionally transporting, e.g., by pipeline, railcar, truck
   or barge, the solution (or the feedstock, enzyme and water, if saccharification is
   performed en route) to a manufacturing plant (step 116), and then bio-processing the
   treated feedstock to produce a desired product (step 118), which is then processed further,
25 e.g., by distillation (step 120). If desired, lignin content can be measured (step 122) and
   process parameters can be set or adjusted based on this measurement (step 124), as
   described in U.S. Application Serial No 12/704,519, filed on February 11, 2010, the
   complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
            Because paper feedstocks are generally low in, or entirely lack, nutrients to
30 support bioprocesses, it is generally preferred that nutrients be added to the system, for
   example in the form of a food-based nutrient source or nutrient package, as disclosed in
   U.S. Application Serial No. 13/184,138, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
                                                    4

    WO 2012/112488                                                            PCT/US2012/024970
   When utilized, the food-based nutrient source or nutrient package is present during bio
   processing (step 118), e.g., fermentation, and may in some preferred implementations
   also be present during the saccharification step (step 114). In some implementations, the
   food-based nutrient source or nutrient package is added at the beginning of step 114,
 5 along with an enzyme combination suitable for saccharification, fermentation, and release
   of nutrients from the food-based nutrient source.
            Saccharification is conducted under a first set of process conditions (e.g.,
   temperature and pH), and then when saccharification has proceeded to a desired extent
   the process conditions may be adjusted (e.g., by adjusting pH from 4 to 5) to allow
10 fermentation to proceed.
            In some cases the feedstock includes materials that are not beneficial to the
   processing of the feedstock or decrease the quality of the intermediates and/or products.
   For example there may be materials that are toxic, and/or solid inorganic materials or
   insoluble organic materials. The toxic materials can be detrimental, for example, by
15 reducing the effectiveness of enzymes and/or microorganisms. Examples of toxic
   materials are pigments and inks described herein. Solid inorganic materials can be
   detrimental, for example, in increasing the total viscosity and density of solutions in
   various processes as well as forming slurries, sludge and settled material that may, for
   example, block openings, be difficult to remove, e.g., from the bottom of tanks, and/or
20 increase the wear on mixers. Examples of inorganic materials are fillers and coatings
   described herein. Insoluble organic materials can, for example, contaminate the final fuel
   products and/or cause foaming during mixing or other processing steps. Examples of
   insoluble organic materials are polymers used in polycoated paper described herein. It
   can therefore be advantageous to remove some of the insoluble solids and organic
25 materials and to detoxify the feedstock at any point during the processing as described
   herein. Surprisingly, it has been found that in some cases materials in the feedstock that
   would be expected to be detrimental, as discussed above, do not significantly adversely
   affect the process. For example, some yeasts that provide ethanol by fermentation of
   sugars derived from paper feedstocks appear to be very resilient to various pigments, inks
30 and fillers.
                                                  5

    WO 2012/112488                                                              PCT/US2012/024970
            The manufacturing plant used in steps 118-120 (and in some cases all of the steps
   described above) can be, for example, an existing starch-based or sugar-based ethanol
   plant or one that has been retrofitted by removing or decommissioning the equipment
   upstream from the bio-processing system (which in a typical ethanol plant generally
 5 includes grain receiving equipment, a hammermill, a slurry mixer, cooking equipment
   and liquefaction equipment). In some cases, the feedstock received by the plant can be
   input directly into the fermentation equipment. A retrofitted plant is shown schematically
   in FIG. 2 and described below as well as, for example, in U.S. Serial No. 12/429,045,
   filed April 23, 2009, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
10 reference.
            FIG. 2 shows one particular system that utilizes the steps described above for
   treating a feedstock and then using the treated feedstock in a fermentation process to
   produce an alcohol. System 100 includes a module 102 in which a feedstock is initially
   mechanically treated (step 12, above), a module 104 in which the mechanically treated
15 feedstock is structurally modified (step 14, above), e.g., by irradiation, and a module 106 in
   which the structurally modified feedstock is subjected to further mechanical treatment (step
   16, above). As discussed above, the module 106 may be of the same type as the module
   102, or a different type. In some implementations the structurally modified feedstock can be
   returned to module 102 for further mechanical treatment rather than being further
20 mechanically treated in a separate module 106.
            As described herein, many variations of system 100 can be utilized.
            After these treatments, which may be repeated as many times as required to obtain
   desired feedstock properties, the treated feedstock is delivered to a fermentation system 108.
   Mixing may be performed during fermentation, in which case the mixing is preferably
25 relatively gentle (low shear) so as to minimize damage to shear sensitive ingredients such as
   enzymes and other microorganisms. In some embodiments, jet mixing is used, as described
   in U.S. Serial No. 12/782,694, 13/293,977 and 13/293,985, the complete disclosures of
   which are incorporated herein by reference.
            Referring again to FIG. 2, fermentation produces a crude ethanol mixture, which
30 flows into a holding tank 110. Water or other solvent, and other non-ethanol components,
   are stripped from the crude ethanol mixture using a stripping column 112, and the ethanol is
                                                   6

    WO 2012/112488                                                                 PCT/US2012/024970
   then distilled using a distillation unit 114, e.g., a rectifier. Distillation may be by vacuum
   distillation. Finally, the ethanol can be dried using a molecular sieve 116 and/or denatured,
   if necessary, and output to a desired shipping method.
             In some cases, the systems described herein, or components thereof, may be
 5 portable, so that the system can be transported (e.g., by rail, truck, or marine vessel) from
   one location to another. The method steps described herein can be performed at one or
   more locations, and in some cases one or more of the steps can be performed in transit.
   Such mobile processing is described in U.S. Serial No. 12/374,549 and International
   Application No. WO 2008/011598, the full disclosures of which are incorporated herein
10 by reference.
             Any or all of the method steps described herein can be performed at ambient
   temperature. If desired, cooling and/or heating may be employed during certain steps.
   For example, the feedstock may be cooled during mechanical treatment to increase its
   brittleness. In some embodiments, cooling is employed before, during or after the initial
15 mechanical treatment and/or the subsequent mechanical treatment. Cooling may be
   performed as described in U.S. Serial No. 12/502,629, now U.S. Patent No. 7,900,857 the
   full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Moreover, the temperature
   in the fermentation system 108 may be controlled to enhance saccharification and/or
   fermentation.
20           The individual steps of the methods described above, as well as the materials used,
   will now be described in further detail.
   PHYSICAL TREATMENT
             Physical treatment processes can include one or more of any of those described
   herein, such as mechanical treatment, chemical treatment, irradiation, sonication,
25 oxidation, pyrolysis or steam explosion. Treatment methods can be used in combinations
   of two, three, four, or even all of these technologies (in any order). When more than one
   treatment method is used, the methods can be applied at the same time or at different
   times. Other processes that change a molecular structure of a feedstock may also be
   used, alone or in combination with the processes disclosed herein.
                                                      7

    WO 2012/112488                                                             PCT/US2012/024970
   Mechanical Treatments
            In some cases, methods can include mechanically treating the feedstock.
   Mechanical treatments include, for example, cutting, milling, pressing, grinding, shearing
 5 and chopping. Milling may include, for example, ball milling, hammer milling,
   rotor/stator dry or wet milling, freezer milling, blade milling, knife milling, disk milling,
   roller milling or other types of milling. Other mechanical treatments include, e.g., stone
   grinding, cracking, mechanical ripping or tearing, pin grinding or air attrition milling.
            Mechanical treatment can be advantageous for "opening up," "stressing,"
10 breaking and shattering cellulosic or other materials in the feedstock, making the
   cellulose of the materials more susceptible to chain scission and/or reduction of
   crystallinity. The open materials can also be more susceptible to oxidation when
   irradiated.
            In some cases, the mechanical treatment may include an initial preparation of the
15 feedstock as received, e.g., size reduction of materials, such as by cutting, grinding,
   shearing, pulverizing or chopping. For example, in some cases, loose feedstock (e.g.,
   Machine Offset Paper and/or Polycoated Paper) is prepared by shearing or shredding.
            Alternatively, or in addition, the feedstock material can first be physically treated
   by one or more of the other physical treatment methods, e.g., chemical treatment,
20 radiation, sonication, oxidation, pyrolysis or steam explosion, and then mechanically
   treated. This sequence can be advantageous since materials treated by one or more of the
   other treatments, e.g., irradiation or pyrolysis, tend to be more brittle and, therefore, it
   may be easier to further change the molecular structure of the material by mechanical
   treatment.
25          In some embodiments, mechanical treatment includes shearing to expose fibers of
   the material. Shearing can be performed, for example, using a rotary knife cutter. Other
   methods of mechanically treating the feedstock include, for example, milling or grinding.
   Milling may be performed using, for example, a hammer mill, ball mill, colloid mill,
   conical or cone mill, disk mill, edge mill, Wiley mill or grist mill. Grinding may be
30 performed using, for example, a stone grinder, pin grinder, coffee grinder, or burr
   grinder. Grinding may be provided, for example, by a reciprocating pin or other element,
                                                   8

    WO 2012/112488                                                              PCT/US2012/024970
   as is the case in a pin mill. Other mechanical treatment methods include mechanical
   ripping or tearing, other methods that apply pressure to the material, and air attrition
   milling. Suitable mechanical treatments further include any other technique that changes
   the molecular structure of the feedstock.
 5          If desired, the mechanically treated material can be passed through a screen, e.g.,
   having an average opening size of 1.59 mm or less (1/16 inch, 0.0625 inch). In some
   embodiments, shearing, or other mechanical treatment, and screening are performed
   concurrently. For example, a rotary knife cutter can be used to concurrently shear and
   screen the feedstock. The feedstock is sheared between stationary blades and rotating
10 blades to provide a sheared material that passes through a screen, and is captured in a bin.
            The paper feedstock can be mechanically treated in a dry state (e.g., having little
   or no free water on its surface), a hydrated state (e.g., having up to ten percent by weight
   absorbed water), or in a wet state, e.g., having between about 10 percent and about 75
   percent by weight water. The fiber source can even be mechanically treated while
15 partially or fully submerged under a liquid, such as water, ethanol or isopropanol.
            The feedstock can also be mechanically treated under a gas (such as a stream or
   atmosphere of gas other than air), e.g., oxygen or nitrogen, or steam.
            Mechanical treatment systems can be configured to produce streams with specific
   morphology characteristics such as, for example, surface area, porosity, bulk density, and
20 length-to-width ratio.
            In some embodiments, a BET surface area of the mechanically treated material is
   greater than 0.1 m 2/g, e.g., greater than 0.25 m 2/g, greater than 0.5 m 2/g, greater than 1.0
   m 2/g, greater than 1.5 m 2/g, greater than 1.75 m 2/g, greater than 5.0 m 2/g, greater than 10
   m 2/g, greater than 25 m 2/g, greater than 35 m 2/g, greater than 50m 2/g, greater than 60
25 m 2/g, greater than 75 m 2/g, greater than 100 m 2/g, greater than 150 m 2/g, greater than 200
   m2/g, or even greater than 250 m 2/g.
            In some situations, it can be desirable to prepare a low bulk density material,
   densify the material (e.g., to make it easier and less costly to transport to another site),
   and then revert the material to a lower bulk density state. Densified materials can be
30 processed by any of the methods described herein, or any material processed by any of
   the methods described herein can be subsequently densified, e.g., as disclosed in U.S.

            One or more radiation processing sequences can be used to process the paper
 5 feedstock, and to provide a structurally modified material which functions as input to
   further processing steps and/or sequences. Irradiation can, for example, reduce the
   molecular weight and/or crystallinity of feedstock. Radiation can also sterilize the
   materials, or any media needed to bioprocess the material.
            In some embodiments, the radiation may be provided by (1) heavy charged
10 particles, such as alpha particles or protons, (2) electrons, produced, for example, in beta
   decay or electron beam accelerators, or (3) electromagnetic radiation, for example,
   gamma rays, x rays, or ultraviolet rays. In one approach, radiation produced by
   radioactive substances can be used to irradiate the feedstock. In another approach,
   electromagnetic radiation (e.g., produced using electron beam emitters) can be used to
15 irradiate the feedstock. In some embodiments, any combination in any order or
   concurrently of (1) through (3) may be utilized. The doses applied depend on the desired
   effect and the particular feedstock.
            In some instances when chain scission is desirable and/or polymer chain
   functionalization is desirable, particles heavier than electrons, such as protons, helium
20 nuclei, argon ions, silicon ions, neon ions, carbon ions, phosphorus ions, oxygen ions or
   nitrogen ions can be utilized. When ring-opening chain scission is desired, positively
   charged particles can be utilized for their Lewis acid properties for enhanced ring
   opening chain scission. For example, when maximum oxidation is desired, oxygen ions
   can be utilized, and when maximum nitration is desired, nitrogen ions can be utilized.
25 The use of heavy particles and positively charged particles is described in U.S. Serial No.
   12/417,699, now U.S. Patent No. 7,931,784, the full disclosure of which is incorporated
   herein by reference.
            In one method, a first material that is or includes cellulose having a first number
   average molecular weight    (MN1)  is irradiated, e.g., by treatment with ionizing radiation
30 (e.g., in the form of gamma radiation, X-ray radiation, 100 nm to 280 nm ultraviolet (UV)

    WO 2012/112488                                                                PCT/US2012/024970
   light, a beam of electrons or other charged particles) to provide a second material that
   includes cellulose having a second number average molecular weight (MN2) lower than
   the first number average molecular weight. The second material (or the first and second
   material) can be combined with a microorganism (with or without enzyme treatment) that
 5 can utilize the second and/or first material or its constituent sugars or lignin to produce an
   intermediate or product, such as those described herein.
             Since the second material includes cellulose having a reduced molecular weight
   relative to the first material, and in some instances, a reduced crystallinity as well, the
   second material is generally more dispersible, swellable and/or soluble, e.g., in a solution
10 containing a microorganism and/or an enzyme. These properties make the second
   material easier to process and more susceptible to chemical, enzymatic and/or biological
   attack relative to the first material, which can greatly improve the production rate and/or
   production level of a desired product, e.g., ethanol.
             In some embodiments, the second number average molecular weight (MN2) is
15 lower than the first number average molecular weight (MN1) by more than about 10
   percent, e.g., more than about 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50 percent, 60 percent, or even more
   than about 75 percent.
             In some instances, the second material includes cellulose that has a crystallinity
   (C 2 ) that is lower than the crystallinity (C1) of the cellulose of the first material. For
20 example, (C2 ) can be lower than (C1) by more than about 10 percent, e.g., more than
   about 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, or even more than about 50 percent.
             In some embodiments, the second material can have a level of oxidation (02) that
   is higher than the level of oxidation (01) of the first material. A higher level of oxidation
   of the material can aid in its dispersability, swellability and/or solubility, further
25 enhancing the material's susceptibility to chemical, enzymatic or biological attack. In
   some embodiments, to increase the level of the oxidation of the second material relative
   to the first material, the irradiation is performed under an oxidizing environment, e.g.,
   under a blanket of air or oxygen, producing a second material that is more oxidized than
   the first material. For example, the second material can have more hydroxyl groups,
30 aldehyde groups, ketone groups, ester groups or carboxylic acid groups, which can
   increase its hydrophilicity.

    WO 2012/112488                                                            PCT/US2012/024970
           Ionizing Radiation
           Each form of radiation ionizes the paper feedstock via particular interactions, as
   determined by the energy of the radiation. Heavy charged particles primarily ionize
   matter via Coulomb scattering; furthermore, these interactions produce energetic
 5 electrons that may further ionize matter. Alpha particles are identical to the nucleus of a
   helium atom and are produced by the alpha decay of various radioactive nuclei, such as
   isotopes of bismuth, polonium, astatine, radon, francium, radium, several actinides, such
   as actinium, thorium, uranium, neptunium, curium, californium, americium, and
   plutonium.
10         When particles are utilized, they can be neutral (uncharged), positively charged or
   negatively charged. When charged, the charged particles can bear a single positive or
   negative charge, or multiple charges, e.g., one, two, three or even four or more charges.
   In instances in which chain scission is desired, positively charged particles may be
   desirable, in part due to their acidic nature. When particles are utilized, the particles can
15 have the mass of a resting electron, or greater, e.g., 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 10,000 or
   even 100,000 times the mass of a resting electron. For example, the particles can have a
   mass of from about 1 atomic unit to about 150 atomic units, e.g., from about 1 atomic
   unit to about 50 atomic units, or from about I to about 25, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12 or 15
   amu. Accelerators used to accelerate the particles can be electrostatic DC,
20 electrodynamic DC, RF linear, magnetic induction linear or continuous wave. For
   example, cyclotron type accelerators are available from IBA, Belgium, such as the
   Rhodotron@ system, while DC type accelerators are available from RDI, now IBA
   Industrial, such as the Dynamitron@. Ions and ion accelerators are discussed in

30         Gamma radiation has the advantage of a significant penetration depth into a
   variety of materials. Sources of gamma rays include radioactive nuclei, such as isotopes
                                                  12

    WO 2012/112488                                                               PCT/US2012/024970
   of cobalt, calcium, technicium, chromium, gallium, indium, iodine, iron, krypton,
   samarium, selenium, sodium, thalium, and xenon.
           Sources of x rays include electron beam collision with metal targets, such as
   tungsten or molybdenum or alloys, or compact light sources, such as those produced
 5 commercially by Lyncean.
           Sources for ultraviolet radiation include deuterium or cadmium lamps.
           Sources for infrared radiation include sapphire, zinc, or selenide window ceramic
   lamps.
           Sources for microwaves include klystrons, Slevin type RF sources, or atom beam
10 sources that employ hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen gases.
           In some embodiments, a beam of electrons is used as the radiation source. A
   beam of electrons has the advantages of high dose rates (e.g., 1, 5, or even 10 Mrad per
   second), high throughput, less containment, and less confinement equipment. Electrons
   can also be more efficient at causing chain scission. In addition, electrons having
15 energies of 4-10 MeV can have a penetration depth of 5 to 30 mm or more, such as 40
   mm.
           Electron beams can be generated, e.g., by electrostatic generators, cascade
   generators, transformer generators, low energy accelerators with a scanning system, low
   energy accelerators with a linear cathode, linear accelerators, and pulsed accelerators.
20 Electrons as an ionizing radiation source can be useful, e.g., for relatively thin sections of
   material, e.g., less than 0.5 inch, e.g., less than 0.4 inch, 0.3 inch, 0.2 inch, or less than
   0.1 inch. In some embodiments, the energy of each electron of the electron beam is from
   about 0.3 MeV to about 2.0 MeV (million electron volts), e.g., from about 0.5 MeV to
   about 1.5 MeV, or from about 0.7 MeV to about 1.25 MeV.
25         Electron beam irradiation devices may be procured commercially from Ion Beam
   Applications, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium or the Titan Corporation, San Diego, CA.
   Typical electron energies can be 1 MeV, 2 MeV, 4.5 MeV, 7.5 MeV, or 10 MeV.
   Typical electron beam irradiation device power can be 1 kW, 5 kW, 10 kW, 20 kW, 50
   kW, 100 kW, 250 kW, or 500 kW. The level of depolymerization of the feedstock
30 depends on the electron energy used and the dose applied, while exposure time depends
   on the power and dose. Typical doses may take values of 1 kGy, 5 kGy, 10 kGy, 20 kGy,
                                                    13

    WO 2012/112488                                                            PCT/US2012/024970
   50 kGy, 100 kGy, or 200 kGy. In a some embodiments energies between 0.25-10 MeV
   (e.g., 0.5-0.8 MeV, 0.5-5 MeV, 0.8-4 MeV, 0.8-3 MeV, 0.8-2 MeV or 0.8-1.5 MeV) can
   be used. In some embodiment doses between 1-100 Mrad (e.g., 2-80 Mrad, 5-50 Mrad, 5
   40 Mrad, 5-30 Mrad or 5-20 Mrad) can be used. In some preferred embodiments, an
 5 energy between 0.8-3 MeV (e.g., 0.8-2 MeV or 0.8-1.5 MeV) combined with doses
   between 5-50 Mrad (e.g., 5-40 Mrad, 5-30 Mrad or 5-20 Mrad) can be used.
            Ion Particle Beams
            Particles heavier than electrons can be utilized to irradiate paper feedstock
   materials. For example, protons, helium nuclei, argon ions, silicon ions, neon ions carbon
10 ions, phosphorus ions, oxygen ions or nitrogen ions can be utilized. In some
   embodiments, particles heavier than electrons can induce higher amounts of chain
   scission (relative to lighter particles). In some instances, positively charged particles can
   induce higher amounts of chain scission than negatively charged particles due to their
   acidity.
15          Heavier particle beams can be generated, e.g., using linear accelerators or
   cyclotrons. In some embodiments, the energy of each particle of the beam is from about
   1.0 MeV/atomic unit (MeV/amu) to about 6,000 MeV/atomic unit, e.g., from about 3
   MeV/ atomic unit to about 4,800 MeV/atomic unit, or from about 10 MeV/atomic unit to
   about 1,000 MeV/atomic unit.
20          In certain embodiments, ion beams used to irradiate paper feedstock can include
   more than one type of ion. For example, ion beams can include mixtures of two or more
   (e.g., three, four or more) different types of ions. Exemplary mixtures can include carbon
   ions and protons, carbon ions and oxygen ions, nitrogen ions and protons, and iron ions
   and protons. More generally, mixtures of any of the ions discussed above (or any other
25 ions) can be used to form irradiating ion beams. In particular, mixtures of relatively light
   and relatively heavier ions can be used in a single ion beam.
            In some embodiments, ion beams for irradiating paper feedstock include
   positively-charged ions. The positively charged ions can include, for example, positively
   charged hydrogen ions (e.g., protons), noble gas ions (e.g., helium, neon, argon), carbon
30 ions, nitrogen ions, oxygen ions, silicon atoms, phosphorus ions, and metal ions such as
                                                  14

    WO 2012/112488                                                            PCT/US2012/024970
   sodium ions, calcium ions, and/or iron ions. Without wishing to be bound by any theory,
   it is believed that such positively-charged ions behave chemically as Lewis acid moieties
   when exposed to materials, initiating and sustaining cationic ring-opening chain scission
   reactions in an oxidative environment.
 5           In certain embodiments, ion beams for irradiating paper feedstock include
   negatively-charged ions. Negatively charged ions can include, for example, negatively
   charged hydrogen ions (e.g., hydride ions), and negatively charged ions of various
   relatively electronegative nuclei (e.g., oxygen ions, nitrogen ions, carbon ions, silicon
   ions, and phosphorus ions). Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed
10 that such negatively-charged ions behave chemically as Lewis base moieties when
   exposed to materials, causing anionic ring-opening chain scission reactions in a reducing
   environment.
             In some embodiments, beams for irradiating paper feedstock can include neutral
   atoms. For example, any one or more of hydrogen atoms, helium atoms, carbon atoms,
15 nitrogen atoms, oxygen atoms, neon atoms, silicon atoms, phosphorus atoms, argon
   atoms, and iron atoms can be included in beams that are used for irradiation. In general,
   mixtures of any two or more of the above types of atoms (e.g., three or more, four or
   more, or even more) can be present in the beams.
             In certain embodiments, ion beams used to irradiate paper feedstock include
20 singly-charged ions such as one or more of H, H-, He, New, Ar, C, C-, O, 0-, N, N-,
   Si+, Si-, P, P-, Na+, Ca+, and Fe+. In some embodiments, ion beams can include
   multiply-charged ions such as one or more of C2+, C", C4+, N 3, N 5, N             o2, 022-,
                                                                                      92-
                          4
   Si2+ Si4+ Si2-, and Si -. In general, the ion beams can also include more complex
   polynuclear ions that bear multiple positive or negative charges. In certain embodiments,
25 by virtue of the structure of the polynuclear ion, the positive or negative charges can be
   effectively distributed over substantially the entire structure of the ions. In some
   embodiments, the positive or negative charges can be somewhat localized over portions
   of the structure of the ions.
                                                  15

    WO 2012/112488                                                             PCT/US2012/024970
            Electromagnetic Radiation
            In embodiments in which the irradiating is performed with electromagnetic
   radiation, the electromagnetic radiation can have, e.g., energy per photon (in electron
   volts) of greater than 102 eV, e.g., greater than 10', 104, 105, 106, or even greater than 107
 5 eV. In some embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation has energy per photon of
   between 104 and 10 7 , e.g., between 105 and 106 eV. The electromagnetic radiation can
   have a frequency of, e.g., greater than 1016 hz, greater than 1017 hz, 1011, 1019, 102, or
   even greater than 1021 hz. Typical doses may take values of greater than 1 Mrad (e.g.,
   greater than 1 Mrad, greater than 2 Mrad). In some embodiments, the electromagnetic
10 radiation has a frequency of between 1018 and 1022 hz, e.g., between 1019 to 1021 hz. In
   some embodiment doses between 1-100 Mrad (e.g., 2-80 Mrad, 5-50 Mrad, 5-40 Mrad,
   5-30 Mrad or 5-20 Mrad) can be used.
            Ouenching and Controlled Functionalization
15          After treatment with ionizing radiation, any of the materials or mixtures described
   herein may become ionized; that is, the treated material may include radicals at levels
   that are detectable with an electron spin resonance spectrometer. If an ionized feedstock
   remains in the atmosphere, it will be oxidized, such as to an extent that carboxylic acid
   groups are generated by reacting with the atmospheric oxygen. In some instances with
20 some materials, such oxidation is desired because it can aid in the further breakdown in
   molecular weight of the carbohydrate-containing biomass, and the oxidation groups, e.g.,
   carboxylic acid groups can be helpful for solubility and microorganism utilization in
   some instances. However, since the radicals can "live" for some time after irradiation,
   e.g., longer than 1 day, 5 days, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months or even longer than 1 year,
25 material properties can continue to change over time, which in some instances, can be
   undesirable. Thus, it may be desirable to quench the ionized material.
            After ionization, any ionized material can be quenched to reduce the level of
   radicals in the ionized material, e.g., such that the radicals are no longer detectable with
   the electron spin resonance spectrometer. For example, the radicals can be quenched by
30 the application of a sufficient pressure to the material and/or by utilizing a fluid in contact
   with the ionized material, such as a gas or liquid, that reacts with (quenches) the radicals.
                                                  16

    WO 2012/112488                                                             PCT/US2012/024970
   Using a gas or liquid to at least aid in the quenching of the radicals can be used to
   functionalize the ionized material with a desired amount and kind of functional groups,
   such as carboxylic acid groups, enol groups, aldehyde groups, nitro groups, nitrile
   groups, amino groups, alkyl amino groups, alkyl groups, chloroalkyl groups or
 5 chlorofluoroalkyl groups.
            In some instances, such quenching can improve the stability of some of the
   ionized materials. For example, quenching can improve the resistance of the material to
   oxidation. Functionalization by quenching can also improve the solubility of any
   material described herein, can improve its thermal stability, and can improve material
10 utilization by various microorganisms. For example, the functional groups imparted to
   the material by the quenching can act as receptor sites for attachment by microorganisms,
   e.g., to enhance cellulose hydrolysis by various microorganisms.
            In some embodiments, quenching includes an application of pressure to the
   ionized material, such as by mechanically deforming the material, e.g., directly
15 mechanically compressing the material in one, two, or three dimensions, or applying
   pressure to a fluid in which the material is immersed, e.g., isostatic pressing. In such
   instances, the deformation of the material itself brings radicals, which are often trapped in
   crystalline domains, in close enough proximity so that the radicals can recombine, or
   react with another group. In some instances, the pressure is applied together with the
20 application of heat, such as a sufficient quantity of heat to elevate the temperature of the
   material to above a melting point or softening point of a component of the material, such
   cellulose or another polymer. Heat can improve molecular mobility in the material,
   which can aid in the quenching of the radicals. When pressure is utilized to quench, the
   pressure can be greater than about 1000 psi, such as greater than about 1250 psi, 1450
25 psi, 3625 psi, 5075 psi, 7250 psi, 10000 psi or even greater than 15000 psi.
            In some embodiments, quenching includes contacting the ionized material with a
   fluid, such as a liquid or gas, e.g., a gas capable of reacting with the radicals, such as
   acetylene or a mixture of acetylene in nitrogen, ethylene, chlorinated ethylenes or
   chlorofluoroethylenes, propylene or mixtures of these gases. In other particular
30 embodiments, quenching includes contacting the ionized material with a liquid, e.g., a
   liquid soluble in, or at least capable of penetrating into the material and reacting with the
                                                   17

    WO 2012/112488                                                             PCT/US2012/024970
   radicals, such as a diene, such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene. In some specific embodiments,
   quenching includes contacting the material with an antioxidant, such as Vitamin E. If
   desired, the feedstock can include an antioxidant dispersed therein, and the quenching can
   come from contacting the antioxidant dispersed in the feedstock with the radicals.
 5          Functionalization can be enhanced by utilizing heavy charged ions, such as any of
   the heavier ions described herein. For example, if it is desired to enhance oxidation,
   charged oxygen ions can be utilized for the irradiation. If nitrogen functional groups are
   desired, nitrogen ions or anions that include nitrogen can be utilized. Likewise, if sulfur
   or phosphorus groups are desired, sulfur or phosphorus ions can be used in the
10 irradiation.
            Doses
            In some instances, the irradiation is performed at a dosage rate of greater than
   about 0.25 Mrad per second, e.g., greater than about 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, or even
   greater than about 2.5 Mrad per second. In some embodiments, the irradiating is
15 performed at a dose rate of between 5.0 and 1500.0 kilorads/hour, e.g., between 10.0 and
   750.0 kilorads/hour or between 50.0 and 350.0 kilorads/hour. In some embodiments,
   irradiation is performed at a dose rate of greater than about 0.25 Mrad per second, e.g.,
   greater than about 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, or even greater than about 20 Mrad
   per second, e.g., about 0.25 to 2 Mrad per second.
20          In some embodiments, the irradiating (with any radiation source or a combination
   of sources) is performed until the material receives a dose of 0.25 Mrad, e.g., at least 1.0,
   2.5, 5.0, 8.0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, or even at least 100 Mrad. In some
   embodiments, the irradiating is performed until the material receives a dose of between
   1.0 Mrad and 6.0 Mrad, e.g., between 1.5 Mrad and 4.0 Mrad, 2 Mrad and 10 Mrad, 5
25 Mrad and 20 Mrad, 10 Mrad and 30 Mrad, 10 Mrad and 40 Mrad, or 20 Mrad and 50
   Mrad. In some embodiments, the irradiating is performed until the material receives a
   dose of from about 0.1 Mrad to about 500 Mrad, from about 0.5 Mrad to about 200 Mrad,
   from about 1 Mrad to about 100 Mrad, or from about 5 Mrad to about 60 Mrad. In some
   embodiments, a relatively low dose of radiation is applied, e.g., less than 60 Mrad.

    WO 2012/112488                                                               PCT/US2012/024970
   Sonication
            Sonication can reduce the molecular weight and/or crystallinity of the polymers
   comprising the paper feedstock, e.g., cellulose. Sonication can also be used to sterilize
   the materials. As discussed above with regard to radiation, the process parameters used
 5 for sonication can be varied depending on various factors.
            In one method, a first material that includes cellulose having a first number
   average molecular weight     (MN1)  is dispersed in a medium, such as water, and sonicated
   and/or otherwise cavitated, to provide a second material that includes cellulose having a
   second number average molecular weight        (MN2)   lower than the first number average
10 molecular weight. The second material (or the first and second material in certain
   embodiments) can be combined with a microorganism (with or without enzyme
   treatment) that can utilize the second and/or first material to produce an intermediate or
   product.
            Since the second material includes cellulose having a reduced molecular weight
15 relative to the first material, and in some instances, a reduced crystallinity as well, the
   second material is generally more dispersible, swellable, and/or soluble, e.g., in a solution
   containing a microorganism.
            In some embodiments, the second number average molecular weight            (MN2) is
   lower than the first number average molecular weight       (MN1)  by more than about 10
20 percent, e.g., more than about 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50 percent, 60 percent, or even more
   than about 75 percent.
            In some instances, the second material includes cellulose that has a crystallinity
   (C2 ) that is lower than the crystallinity (C1) of the cellulose of the first material. For
   example, (C2 ) can be lower than (C1) by more than about 10 percent, e.g., more than
25 about 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, or even more than about 50 percent.
            In some embodiments, the sonication medium is an aqueous medium. If desired,
   the medium can include an oxidant, such as a peroxide (e.g., hydrogen peroxide), a
   dispersing agent and/or a buffer. Examples of dispersing agents include ionic dispersing
   agents, e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate, and non-ionic dispersing agents, e.g., poly(ethylene
30 glycol).
                                                   19

    WO 2012/112488                                                                PCT/US2012/024970
             In other embodiments, the sonication medium is non-aqueous. For example, the
   sonication can be performed in a hydrocarbon, e.g., toluene or heptane, an ether, e.g.,
   diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, or even in a liquefied gas such as argon, xenon, or
   nitrogen.
 5
   Pyrolysis
             One or more pyrolysis processing sequences can be used to process paper
   feedstock from a wide variety of different sources to extract useful substances from the
   materials, and to provide partially degraded materials which function as input to further
10 processing steps and/or sequences. Pyrolysis can also be used to sterilize the materials.
   Pyrolysis conditions can be varied depending on the characteristics of the feedstock
   and/or other factors.
             In one example, a first material that includes cellulose having a first number
   average molecular weight (MN1) is pyrolyzed, e.g., by heating the first material in a tube
15 furnace (in the presence or absence of oxygen), to provide a second material that includes
   cellulose having a second number average molecular weight (MN2) lower than the first
   number average molecular weight.
             Since the second material includes cellulose having a reduced molecular weight
   relative to the first material, and in some instances, a reduced crystallinity as well, the
20 second material is generally more dispersible, swellable and/or soluble, e.g., in a solution
   containing a microorganism.
             In some embodiments, the second number average molecular weight (MN2) is
   lower than the first number average molecular weight (MN1) by more than about 10
   percent, e.g., more than about 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50 percent, 60 percent, or even more
25 than about 75 percent.
             In some instances, the second material includes cellulose that has a crystallinity
   (C 2 ) that is lower than the crystallinity (C1) of the cellulose of the first material. For
   example, (C 2 ) can be lower than (C1) by more than about 10 percent, e.g., more than
   about 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, or even more than about 50 percent.
                                                    20

    WO 2012/112488                                                            PCT/US2012/024970
           In some embodiments, the pyrolysis of the materials is continuous. In other
   embodiments, the material is pyrolyzed for a pre-determined time, and then allowed to
   cool for a second pre-determined time before pyrolyzing again.
 5 Oxidation
           One or more oxidative processing sequences can be used to process paper
   feestock from a wide variety of different sources to extract useful substances from the
   feedstock, and to provide partially degraded and/or altered feedstock which functions as
   input to further processing steps and/or sequences. The oxidation conditions can be
10 varied, e.g., depending on the lignin content of the feedstock, with a higher degree of
   oxidation generally being desired for higher lignin content feedstocks.
           In one method, a first material that includes cellulose having a first number
   average molecular weight    (MN1)  and having a first oxygen content (01) is oxidized, e.g.,
   by heating the first material in a stream of air or oxygen-enriched air, to provide a second
15 material that includes cellulose having a second number average molecular weight        (MN2)
   and having a second oxygen content      (02) higher than the first oxygen content (01).
           The second number average molecular weight of the second material is generally
   lower than the first number average molecular weight of the first material. For example,
   the molecular weight may be reduced to the same extent as discussed above with respect
20 to the other physical treatments. The crystallinity of the second material may also be
   reduced to the same extent as discussed above with respect to the other physical
   treatments.
           In some embodiments, the second oxygen content is at least about five percent
   higher than the first oxygen content, e.g., 7.5 percent higher, 10.0 percent higher, 12.5
25 percent higher, 15.0 percent higher or 17.5 percent higher. In some preferred
   embodiments, the second oxygen content is at least about 20.0 percent higher than the
   first oxygen content of the first material. Oxygen content is measured by elemental
   analysis by pyrolyzing a sample in a furnace operating at 1300 0C or higher. A suitable
   elemental analyzer is the LECO CHNS-932 analyzer with a VTF-900 high temperature
30 pyrolysis furnace.
                                                  21

    WO 2012/112488                                                           PCT/US2012/024970
           Generally, oxidation of a material occurs in an oxidizing environment. For
   example, the oxidation can be effected or aided by pyrolysis in an oxidizing environment,
   such as in air or argon enriched in air. To aid in the oxidation, various chemical agents,
   such as oxidants, acids or bases can be added to the material prior to or during oxidation.
 5 For example, a peroxide (e.g., benzoyl peroxide) can be added prior to oxidation.
           Some oxidative methods of reducing recalcitrance in a paper feedstock employ
   Fenton-type chemistry. Such methods are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Serial No.
   12/639,289, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
           Exemplary oxidants include peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide and benzoyl
10 peroxide, persulfates, such as ammonium persulfate, activated forms of oxygen, such as
   ozone, permanganates, such as potassium permanganate, perchlorates, such as sodium
   perchlorate, and hypochlorites, such as sodium hypochlorite (household bleach).
           In some situations, pH is maintained at or below about 5.5 during contact, such as
   between 1 and 5, between 2 and 5, between 2.5 and 5 or between about 3 and 5.
15 Oxidation conditions can also include a contact period of between 2 and 12 hours, e.g.,
   between 4 and 10 hours or between 5 and 8 hours. In some instances, temperature is
   maintained at or below 300 0C, e.g., at or below 250, 200, 150, 100 or 50 0C. In some
   instances, the temperature remains substantially ambient, e.g., at or about 20-25 0 C.
           In some embodiments, the one or more oxidants are applied as a gas, such as by
20 generating ozone in-situ by irradiating the material through air with a beam of particles,
   such as electrons.
           In some embodiments, the mixture further includes one or more hydroquinones,
   such as 2,5-dimethoxyhydroquinone (DMHQ) and/or one or more benzoquinones, such
   as 2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (DMBQ), which can aid in electron transfer
25 reactions.
           In some embodiments, the one or more oxidants are electrochemically-generated
   in-situ. For example, hydrogen peroxide and/or ozone can be electro-chemically
   produced within a contact or reaction vessel.
                                                 22

    WO 2012/112488                                                           PCT/US2012/024970
   Other Processes To Solubilize, Reduce Recalcitrance Or To Functionalize
            Any of the processes of this paragraph can be used alone without any of the
   processes described herein, or in combination with any of the processes described herein
   (in any order): steam explosion, chemical treatment (e.g., acid treatment (including
 5 concentrated and dilute acid treatment with mineral acids, such as sulfuric acid,
   hydrochloric acid and organic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid) and/or base treatment
   (e.g., treatment with lime or sodium hydroxide)), UV treatment, screw extrusion
   treatment (see, e.g., U.S. Serial No. 13/099,15 1, solvent treatment (e.g., treatment with
   ionic liquids) and freeze milling (see, e.g., U.S. Serial No. 12/502,629 now U.S. Patent
10 No. 7,900,857).
   Saccharification
            In order to convert the paper feedstock to fermentable sugars, the cellulose in the
   feedstock is hydrolyzed by a saccharifying agent, e.g., an enzyme, a process referred to as
15 saccharification. The materials that include the cellulose are treated with the enzyme,
   e.g., by combining the material and the enzyme in a solvent, e.g., in an aqueous solution.
            Enzymes and organisms that break down cellulose contain or manufacture various
   cellulolytic enzymes (cellulases), ligninases or various small molecule biomass
   destroying metabolites. These enzymes may be a complex of enzymes that act
20 synergistically to degrade crystalline cellulose. Examples of cellulolytic enzymes
   include: endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and cellobiases (0-glucosidases). Referring
   to FIG. 3, a cellulosic substrate is initially hydrolyzed by endoglucanases at random
   locations producing oligomeric intermediates. These intermediates are then substrates for
   exo-splitting glucanases such as cellobiohydrolase to produce cellobiose from the ends of
25 the cellulose polymer. Cellobiose is a water-soluble 1,4-linked dimer of glucose. Finally
   cellobiase cleaves cellobiose to yield glucose.
            Suitable saccharifying agents are described, for example, in the Materials section
   below.
            As noted above, a food-based nutrient source or nutrient package is preferably
30 added prior to or during saccharification, and an enzyme is added that is selected to
                                                   23

    WO 2012/112488                                                             PCT/US2012/024970
   release nutrients from the food-based nutrient source. Suitable enzymes are described,
   for example, in the Materials section below.
            The saccharification process can be partially or completely performed in a tank
   (e.g., a tank having a volume of at least 4000, 40,000, 400,000 L or 1,000,000 L) in a
 5 manufacturing plant, and/or can be partially or completely performed in transit, e.g., in a
   rail car, tanker truck, or in a supertanker or the hold of a ship. The time required for
   complete saccharification will depend on the process conditions and the feedstock and
   enzyme used. If saccharification is performed in a manufacturing plant under controlled
   conditions, the cellulose may be substantially entirely converted to glucose in about 12
10 96 hours. If saccharification is performed partially or completely in transit,
   saccharification may take longer.
            It is generally preferred that the tank contents be mixed during saccharification,
   e.g., using jet mixing as described in U.S. Applications Serial Nos. 12/782,694,
   13/293,985 and 13/293,977, the full disclosure of which are incorporated by reference
15 herein.
            The addition of surfactants can enhance the rate of saccharification. Examples of
   surfactants include non-ionic surfactants, such as a Tween@ 20 or Tween@ 80
   polyethylene glycol surfactants, ionic surfactants, or amphoteric surfactants.
            It is generally preferred that the concentration of the resulting glucose solution be
20 relatively high, e.g., greater than 40%, or greater than 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or even greater
   than 95% by weight. This reduces the volume to be shipped, if saccharification and
   fermentation are performed at different locations, and also inhibits microbial growth in
   the solution. However, lower concentrations may be used, in which case it may be
   desirable to add an antimicrobial additive, e.g., a broad spectrum antibiotic, in a low
25 concentration, e.g., 50 to 150 ppm. Other suitable antibiotics include amphotericin B,
   ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, hygromycin B, kanamycin,
   neomycin, penicillin, puromycin, streptomycin. Antibiotics will inhibit growth of
   microorganisms during transport and storage, and can be used at appropriate
   concentrations, e.g., between 15 and 1000 ppm by weight, e.g., between 25 and 500 ppm,
30 or between 50 and 150 ppm. If desired, an antibiotic can be included even if the sugar
   concentration is relatively high.
                                                   24

    WO 2012/112488                                                             PCT/US2012/024970
           A relatively high concentration solution can be obtained by limiting the amount of
   water added to the feedstock with the enzyme. The concentration can be controlled, e.g.,
   by controlling how much saccharification takes place. For example, concentration can be
   increased by adding more feedstock to the solution. In order to keep the sugar that is
 5 being produced in solution, a surfactant can be added, e.g., one of those discussed above.
   Solubility can also be increased by increasing the temperature of the solution. For
   example, the solution can be maintained at a temperature of 40-50'C, 60-80'C, or even
   higher.
           In some embodiments, the feedstock is processed to convert it to a convenient and
10 concentrated solid material, e.g., in a powdered, granulate or particulate form. The
   concentrated material can be in a purified, or a raw or crude form. The concentrated form
   can have, for example, a total sugar concentration of between about 90 percent by weight
   and about 100 percent by weight, e.g., 92, 94, 96 or 98 percent by weight sugar. Such a
   form can be particularly cost effective to ship, e.g., to a bioprocessing facility, such as a
15 biofuel manufacturing plant. Such a form can also be advantageous to store and handle,
   easier to manufacture and becomes both an intermediate and a product, providing an
   option to the biorefinery as to which products to manufacture.
           In some instances, the powdered, granulate or particulate material can also
   include one or more of the materials, e.g., additives or chemicals, described herein, such
20 as the food-based nutrient or nutrient package, a nitrogen source, e.g., urea, a surfactant,
   an enzyme, or any microorganism described herein. In some instances, all materials
   needed for a bio-process are combined in the powdered, granulate or particulate material.
   Such a form can be a particularly convenient form for transporting to a remote
   bioprocessing facility, such as a remote biofuels manufacturing facility. Such a form can
25 also be advantageous to store and handle.
           In some instances, the powdered, granulate or particulate material (with or
   without added materials, such as additives and chemicals) can be treated by any of the
   physical treatments described in U.S. Serial No. 12/429,045, incorporated by reference
   above. For example, irradiating the powdered, granulate or particulate material can
30 increase its solubility and can sterilize the material so that a bioprocessing facility can
                                                  25

    WO 2012/112488                                                           PCT/US2012/024970
   integrate the material into their process directly as may be required for a contemplated
   intermediate or product.
            In certain instances, the powdered, granulate or particulate material (with or
   without added materials, such as additives and chemicals) can be carried in a structure or
 5 a carrier for ease of transport, storage or handling. For example, the structure or carrier
   can include or incorporate a bag or liner, such as a degradable bag or liner. Such a form
   can be particularly useful for adding directly to a bioprocess system.
   Fermentation
10          Microorganisms can produce a number of useful intermediates and products by
   fermenting a low molecular weight sugar produced by saccharifying the paper feedstock
   materials. For example, fermentation or other bioprocesses can produce alcohols, organic
   acids, hydrocarbons, hydrogen, proteins or mixtures of any of these materials.
            Yeast and Zymomonas bacteria, for example, can be used for fermentation or
15 conversion. Other microorganisms are discussed in the Materials section, below. The
   optimum pH for fermentations is about pH 4 to 7. For example, the optimum pH for yeast
   is from about pH 4 to 5, while the optimum pH for Zymomonas is from about pH 5 to 6.
   Typical fermentation times are about 24 to 168 hours (e.g., 24 to 96 hrs) with
   temperatures in the range of 20 'C to 40 'C (e.g., 26 'C to 40 C), however thermophilic
20 microorganisms prefer higher temperatures.
            In some embodiments e.g., when anaerobic organisms are used, at least a portion
   of the fermentation is conducted in the absence of oxygen e.g., under a blanket of an inert
   gas such as N 2, Ar, He, CO 2 or mixtures thereof. Additionally, the mixture may have a
   constant purge of an inert gas flowing through the tank during part of or all of the
25 fermentation. In some cases, anaerobic condition can be achieved or maintained by
   carbon dioxide production during the fermentation and no additional inert gas is needed.
            In some embodiments, all or a portion of the fermentation process can be
   interrupted before the low molecular weight sugar is completely converted to a product
   (e.g, ethanol). The intermediate fermentation products include high concentrations of
30 sugar and carbohydrates. The sugars and carbohydrates can be isolated as discussed
   below. These intermediate fermentation products can be used in preparation of food for
                                                  26

   human or animal consumption. Additionally or alternatively, the intermediate
   fermentation products can be ground to a fine particle size in a stainless-steel laboratory
   mill to produce a flour-like substance.
            The fermentations include the methods and products that are disclosed in U.S.
 5 Provisional Application Serial No. 61/579,559, filed December 22, 2012, and U.S.
   application 61/579,576, filed December 22, 2012 incorporated by reference herein in its
   entirety.
            Mobile fermentors can be utilized, as described in U.S. Provisional Patent
   Application Serial 60/832,735, now Published International Application No. WO
10 2008/011598. Similarly, the saccharification equipment can be mobile. Further,
   saccharification and/or fermentation may be performed in part or entirely during transit.
   Distillation
            After fermentation, the resulting fluids can be distilled using, for example, a "beer
   column" to separate ethanol and other alcohols from the majority of water and residual
15 solids. The vapor exiting the beer column can be, e.g., 35% by weight ethanol and can be
   fed to a rectification column. A mixture of nearly azeotropic (92.5%) ethanol and water
   from the rectification column can be purified to pure (99.5%) ethanol using vapor-phase
   molecular sieves. The beer column bottoms can be sent to the first effect of a three-effect
   evaporator. The rectification column reflux condenser can provide heat for this first
20 effect. After the first effect, solids can be separated using a centrifuge and dried in a
   rotary dryer. A portion (25%) of the centrifuge effluent can be recycled to fermentation
   and the rest sent to the second and third evaporator effects. Most of the evaporator
   condensate can be returned to the process as fairly clean condensate with a small portion
   split off to waste water treatment to prevent build-up of low-boiling compounds.

   Other Possible Processing of Sugars
            Processing during or after saccharification can include isolation and/or
   concentration of sugars by chromatography e.g., simulated moving bed chromatography,
   precipitation, centrifugation, crystallization, solvent evaporation and combinations
30 thereof. In addition, or optionally, processing can include isomerization of one or more of
                                                   27

   the sugars in the sugar solution or suspension. Additionally, or optionally, the sugar
   solution or suspension can be chemically processed e.g., glucose and xylose can be
   hydrogenated to sorbitol and xylitol respectively. Hydrogenation can be accomplished by

   REMOVING OF FILLERS, INKS, AND COATINGS
           Paper feedstock used in the processes described can contain fillers, coatings,
   laminated material, pigments, inks and binders. These can be removed and either
   discarded or recycled as described here.
15          Inorganic fillers and coatings e.g., those described in the materials section below
   can be removed at any point during the process. For example, the inorganic filler and
   coating can be removed from the feedstock after a mechanical, physical or chemical
   treatment to reduce the recalcitrance of the feedstock; after combination with a fluid;
   after, during or before saccharification; after, during or before a purification step; after,
20 during or before a fermentation step; and/or after, during or before a chemical conversion
   step. The fillers and coatings can be removed by any means e.g., by sedimentation,
   precipitation, ligand sequestration, filtration, floatation, chemical conversion and
   centrifugation. Some of the physical treatments discussed herein (see Physical Treatment
   section) can aid in separating the cellulosic materials from the inorganic fillers and
25 coatings (e.g., mechanical treatments, chemical treatments, irradiation, pyrolysis,
   sonication and/or oxidiation). The recovered inorganic fillers can be recycled or
   discarded.
           Inks that are present can be removed from the feedstock at any point during the
   process. Inks can be a complex medium composed of several components e.g., solvents,
30 pigments, dyes, resins, lubricants, solubilizers, surfactants, particulate matter and/or
   fluorescers. For example, printed papers, e.g., magazines and catalogs, may include high
                                                   28

   levels of the pigments generally used in printing inks. In some cases the papers include
   metal-based pigments, organic pigments, and/or Lake pigments. For example, pigments
   that can be used are Yellow Lakes, Tartrazine Yellow Lake, Hansa Yellows, Diarylide
   Yellows, Yellow azo pigments, Fluorescent Yellow, Diarylide Orange, DNA Orange,

   Blues, Iron Oxide browns, Iron Oxide Reds, Ultramarine Blues, Ultramarine Violet,
   Chromium Antimony Titanium Buff, copper phthalocyanine blue, green copper
   phthalocyanine pigments, potash blue and soda blue pigments. The removal of ink may
   help improve certain parts in the process. For example, some ink can be toxic to
20 microorganisms used in the process. The inks can also impart an undesirable coloration
   or toxicity to the final product. Furthermore, removing the inks may allow these to be
   recycled, improving the cost benefits to the process and lessening the environmental
   impact of the paper feedstock. The inks can be removed by any means. For example,
   removal may include dispersion, floatation, pressing and/or washing steps, extraction
25 with solvents (e.g., supercritical C0 2 , alcohol, water and organic solvents), settling,
   chemical means, sieving and/or precipitation. Some of the physical treatments discussed
   herein (see Physical Treatment section) can aid in separating the cellulosic materials from
   the inks (e.g., mechanical treatments, chemical treatments, irradiation, pyrolysis,
   sonication and/or oxidiation). In addition enzymatic deinking technologies such as those
30 disclosed in U.S. patent 7,297,224 hereby incorporated by reference herein, can be used.

           Coating materials, e.g., those found in poly-coated paper described in the
   materials section below, can be removed from the feedstock at any point during the
   process. This can be done by, for example, the methods mentioned above for removal of
   pigments and inks and inorganic materials. In some cases, where polycoated paper is a
 5 laminate, de-lamination can be done by, for example, chemical and/or mechanical means.
   The non-cellulosic laminate portions can then be separated from the cellulose containing
   layers and discarded and/or recycled.

            Coated papers are well known in the paper art, and are disclosed, for example, in
   U.S. Patent Nos. 6,777,075; 6,783,804, and 7,625,441, the full disclosures of which are
10 incorporated herein by reference.
            Coated papers suitable as feedstock can include paper coated with an inorganic
   material, for example the same materials used as fillers can be used in coatings.
   Additionally, coated papers can include paper coated with a polymer (poly-coated paper).
   Such paper can be made, for example, by extrusion coating, brush coating, curtain
15 coating, blade coating, air knife coating, cast coating or roller coating paper. For
   example, sources of such poly-coated paper include a variety of food containers,
   including juice cartons, condiment pouches (e.g., sugar, salt, pepper), plates, pet food
   bags, cups, bowls, trays and boxes for frozen foods. The poly-coated paper can, in
   addition to paper, contain, for example, polymers, (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene,
20 biodegradable polymers, silicone), latexes, binders, wax, and, in some cases, one or more
   layers of aluminum. The poly coated papers can be multi layered laminate, for example,
   made with one or more, e.g., two, three, four, five or more, layers of polyethylene and
   paper and one or more, e.g., two, three or more layers of aluminum.
            The paper feedstocks typically have a low gross caloric value e.g., below 7500
25 Btu/lb e.g, below 7400 Btu/lb, below 7200 Btu/lb, below 7000 Btu/lb, below 6800 Btu/lb,
