   A SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR EXTRACTION AND REFINING OF TITANIUM
BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
1. Field of the Invention
[0001]      The present invention relates to a system and method for extracting and
refining metals, and more particularly, to a system and method for extracting and
refining titanium.
2. Description of the Related Art
[0002]      Titanium, the ninth most commonly occurring element in the Earth's crust
(and  4 th most abundant structural material), is a corrosion-resistant material with high
strength, a high melting point, and a density approximately 40% less than that of
iron's. These characteristics make titanium the material of choice for many
engineering applications.
[0003]      However, conventional methods to extract titanium from titanium-bearing
ores are costly and inefficient. The most popular conventional method uses titanium
tetrachloride (TiCl 4), a hazardous chemical, as its feedstock, and forms hydrochloric
acid (HCI) as a byproduct. In addition, most conventional methods discharge large
amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (C02), during the formation
of the feedstocks and are limited to high concentration / low impurity titanium-bearing
ores as the initial inputs.
[0004]      Accordingly, there is a need for a metal extraction and refining processes,
and in particular, for titanium extraction and refining processes, that limit the use of
hazardous chemicals or environmental pollutants, and that are capable of using
lower concentration titanium-bearing ores.

reducing the generation of greenhouse gases, such as C02.

[0099]     In one embodiment, the present invention provides systems and methods
for the extraction and refining of metal products including the use of metal-bearing
ores, extraction of metal products from the metal-bearing ores, and refining of the
extracted metal products into refined metal products. For example, in some
embodiments, the present invention provides systems and methods for the
extraction and refining of titanium products from titanium-bearing ores. However, the
present invention is not limited thereto, and other embodiments of the present
invention may be used for the extraction and refining of other metal products, such
as, but not limited to, iron, chromium, copper, manganese, silicon, zirconium,
molybdenum, silver, vanadium, nickel, cobalt, tin, and rare-earth metals.
[00100] One embodiment of the present invention provides a method for the
extraction and refining of titanium products from titanium-bearing ores. As illustrated
in FIG. 1, a method for the extraction and refining of titanium products (1) may
include preparation of the titanium-bearing ore (100), extracting the titanium product
from the titanium-bearing ore (200), and refining the extracted titanium product (300).

                                            16
In other embodiments, the method may include recycling titanium (400) into the
refining of the titanium products (300) and processing the extracted or refined
titanium products into final titanium products (500).
[00101] Unlike conventional processes, the present invention provides an
economical and environmentally safe method of extracting titanium products from a
wide variety of titanium-bearing ores. While conventional methods are limited to the
use of titanium-bearing ores with high concentrations of titanium, the present
invention may use lower-grade titanium-bearing ores. For example, when measured
in terms of titanium oxide (TiO 2) content, many conventional methods require that
the initial titanium-bearing ore have a TiO 2concentration of at least 90%. In contrast,
in some embodiments, the present invention can be used with titanium-bearing ores,
or mixtures of titanium-bearing ores, having a TiO 2 concentration of less than 90%.
In another example, the present invention can be used with titanium-bearing ores, or
mixtures of titanium-bearing ores, having a TiO 2concentration of less than 85%. In
another example, the present invention can be used with titanium-bearing ores, or
mixtures of titanium-bearing ores, having a TiO 2concentration of less than 80%. In
another example, the present invention can be used with titanium-bearing ores, or
mixtures of titanium-bearing ores, having a TiO 2concentration of less than 75%. In
another example, the present invention can be used with titanium-bearing ores, or
mixtures of titanium-bearing ores, having a TiO 2concentration of less than 70%. In
another example, the present invention can be used with titanium-bearing ores, or
mixtures of titanium-bearing ores, having a TiO 2concentration between 25% and
95%. In yet another example, the present invention can be used with titanium
bearing ores, or mixtures of titanium-bearing ores, having a TiO2concentration of at
least 35%. In addition, many conventional methods are unable to process titanium
bearing ores above certain impurity levels, or above a threshold for titanium particle
size. In contrast, in some embodiments, the present invention can use titanium
bearing ores, or mixtures of titanium-bearing ores, having large concentrations of
impurities, such as less than 30% calcium or 20% oxygen by weight, and having
particle sizes of over 100 microns in diameter. In one embodiment, the present
invention can use titanium-bearing ores, or titanium-bearing ore concentrates, having

                                            17
particle sizes of less than 1000 microns in diameter. In other embodiments, the
present invention can use titanium-bearing ores having between 25% and 95%
titanium oxide (TiO 2 ), up to 30% calcium (Ca), up to 20% magnesium (Mg), up to
20% manganese (Mn), and at least 5% by weight iron (Fe). In another embodiment,
the present invention can use titanium-bearing ores having, by weight more than
0.1% or more than 0.5% calcium (Ca), more than 0.1% or more than 0.5%
magnesium (Mg), more than 0.1% or more than 0.5% manganese (Mn), and more
than 0.1% or more than 0.5% iron (Fe). In another embodiment, the present
invention can use titanium-bearing ores having more than 50% titanium oxide (TiO 2 ),
more than 1% calcium (Ca), more than 1% magnesium (Mg), more than 1%
manganese (Mn), and more than 1% by weight iron (Fe). In another embodiment,
the present invention can use titanium-bearing ores having more than 2% calcium
(Ca), more than 2% magnesium (Mg), more than 2% manganese (Mn), and more
than 2% by weight iron (Fe).
[00102] In one embodiment of the invention, the method for the extraction of
titanium products from a titanium-bearing ore and the refining of the extracted
titanium metal products (1) may include preparing the titanium-bearing ore for
extraction. While some embodiments of the present invention are able to use
titanium-bearing ores in their raw state with minimal preparation, most titanium
extraction processes use titanium-bearing ore concentrates. Titanium-bearing ores
are typically laden with impurities and agglomerated as taken from the earth.
Accordingly, the raw titanium-bearing ore may be subject to cleaning or
concentration processes during operation (100) to remove gangue minerals and to
create titanium-bearing ore concentrates before extracting the titanium product
therefrom in operation (200). For example, the raw titanium-bearing ore may be
subject to a physical concentration method, such as crushing, separation of heavier
and lighter particles, and may be subject to removal of gangue minerals by spiral
concentration to produce a titanium-bearing ore concentrate. In one embodiment, the
raw titanium-bearing ores or titanium-bearing ore concentrates are ground to a
nominal particle size range of between 50 to 200 micron diameter in operation (100).
In another embodiment, the raw titanium-bearing ores or titanium-bearing ore

                                            18
concentrates are processed to have a particle size range of up to 1000 micron
diameter in operation (100). Table 1 illustrates the composition of various titanium
bearing ore concentrates used for operation (200).
[00103] In operation (200), titanium product is extracted from the titanium-bearing
ore. The titanium-bearing ore may be prepared beforehand into a titanium-bearing
ore concentrate in operation (100). In one embodiment of the invention, extracting
the titanium product from the titanium-bearing ore (200) includes a thermal extraction
reaction. For example, in one embodiment, the titanium-bearing ore is subject to
thermal extraction to produce the titanium product. In some embodiments, the
titanium-bearing ore is mixed with other components and agents to create a
chemical blend that is then subjected to the thermal extraction. For example, the
titanium-bearing ore may be mixed with one or more other components, such as
reducing agents, viscosity agents, and heat generating components, to create the
chemical blend subjected to thermal extraction in operation (200).
[00104] In one embodiment, the chemical blend includes a reducing agent, such as
aluminum (AI). In general, metals that are more reactive than the metal species
within the ore that is being reduced can be used as reducing agents. However,
factors such as a low cost, a low melting point (6600C), and a high boiling point
(25190C, much higher than titanium's 16700C melting point) influence the choice of
reducing agent, and make aluminum a good choice as a reducing agent. In other
embodiments, magnesium, calcium, and sodium may be used as the reducing agent.
[00105] In another embodiment, the chemical blend includes one or more viscosity
agents to achieve a desired slag viscosity. Adjusting the slag viscosity allows
efficient separation of the metal from the metal-bearing ore, and produces a slag that
can be removed from the metal after solidification and cooling has occurred. In one
embodiment, viscosity agents are chosen that only affect the viscosity of the
chemical blend and resulting slag, and affect the heat of the chemical blend only to a
limited extent. Calcium fluoride (CaF 2) is one example of such a viscosity agent.
CaF 2 does not take part in the chemical reaction between the titanium-bearing ore
and the reducing agent, and only aids in controlling the viscosity of the melt.

                                             19
Moreover, the melting point (14180C) and boiling point (25330C) of CaF 2 bracket the
melting point of Titanium (16700C) making it a good choice as a viscosity agent. In
general, components that do not take part in the reaction and aid in controlling the
viscosity of the slag are potential candidates. In some embodiments, various alkali
halides, alkali-earth halides, and some oxides may be used as viscosity agents.
[00106] In one embodiment, the amount of other components needed for the
chemical blend corresponds to the composition of the titanium-bearing ore. For
example, for a Rutile (TiO 2) titanium-bearing ore concentrate, the amount of other
components would correspond to the following equation: 3TiO 2 + (4+x)AI + yCaF 2
3Ti + x*I + 2AI 2 03 + yCaF 2. In one embodiment, x and y can be varied as follows: 0
x < 3+ and 2 < y < 6+. In another embodiment, the ranges of x and y are 0.3 < x 5 2
and 2 < y < 3. In yet another embodiment, x = 0.8 and y = 2.5.
[00107] In another embodiment, the chemical blend includes a TiO 2titanium-bearing
ore and an aluminum (AI) reducing agent and the weight ratio of TiO 2:AI in the
chemical blend is from 0.90 to 2.4. In others of these embodiments, the weight ratio
of TiO 2:AI in the chemical blend is from 1 to 2.2. In yet others of these embodiments,
the weight ratio of TiO 2:AI in the chemical blend is from 1.2 to 2.1. In others of these
embodiments, the weight ratio of TiO 2 :AI in the chemical blend is from 1.35 to 1.9. In
yet others of these embodiments, the weight ratio of TiO 2:AI in the chemical blend is
from 1.4 to 1.85.
[00108] According to embodiments of the present invention, the extraction
operation (200) may be internally or externally heated.
[00109] In one embodiment, the extraction operation (200) is carried out by an
internally heated reaction using chemical components selected to produce an
internally heated, self-sustaining, extraction reaction. The heat generated during the
extraction reaction must be sufficient to keep the chemical blend in a molten state to
allow effective metal/slag separation.

                                           20
[00110] For example, in an internally heated extraction operation (200), titanium is
separated (extracted) from the titanium-bearing blend to form the titanium product
using a reducing agent, such as aluminum metal, to produce aluminum oxide and
titanium metal according to the following equation: 3TiO 2 + 4Al-> 3Ti + 2Al 203 .
[00111] FIG. 2 illustrates a titanium product puck (20) and slag (21) obtained from a
self-heated extraction reaction. The extraction reaction products illustrated in FIG. 2
have been inverted to show the titanium product puck (20) (on top in the image)
separated from the slag (21) (bottom of image). In other embodiments, the
composition of the resulting titanium product puck depends on the composition of the
titanium-bearing ore that is used in the extraction operation (200). For example,
titanium product resulting from an Ilmenite (FeTiO 3 ) ore will include titanium metal
and iron.
[00112] The heat generated by the titanium-bearing ore and the reducing agent in
the chemical blend may not be sufficient to drive the extraction reaction by
themselves. That is, in order to drive the extraction reaction, the chemical blend must
reach a temperature of at least 16700C to melt the titanium in the chemical blend and
sustain that temperature for a minimum period of time. Accordingly, in some
embodiments of the invention, the chemical blend includes heat generating
components to produce supplementary heat to drive the extraction reaction and the
separation of the titanium product from the slag. The heat generating component will
become a residual product that is mixed with the slag when the extraction reaction is
complete. Calcium sulfate, sulfur, and sodium chlorite are examples of suitable heat
generating components.
[00113] In one embodiment of the present invention, the components of the
chemical blend used for a self-heating extraction reaction are selected to be stable at
room temperature with a high thermal threshold to prevent spontaneous ignition. In
such cases, an ignition component may be required to start the extraction reaction.
This ignition component must provide enough heat in a localized area to push the
extraction reaction over a thermal threshold. Once the reaction starts, it spreads
throughout the rest of the chemical blend and may became self-sustaining.

                                            21
Examples of ignition components include magnesium metal strips or potassium
permanganate (KMnO 4) combined with glycerin.
[00114] In another embodiment of the invention, the extraction operation (200) is
carried out using an external heat source. For example, in one embodiment, the
extracting operation (200) uses an external induction furnace to heat the chemical
blend. In other embodiments, the chemical blend is heated with other external heat
sources, such as a resistive heating furnace or an induction furnace. An externally
heated extraction reaction has a number of advantages over an internal self-heating
reaction and avoids many of the associated potential problems described above. In
general, in an externally heated extraction reaction, the external heat initiates the
extraction process at a temperature between 15000C and 16000C during the
induction furnace temperature ramp up. Externally heated extraction reactions heat
the entire reaction vessel, and allow the chemical blend to blend evenly and
thoroughly, allowing the resulting titanium product and slag to separate well.
[00115] In one embodiment, the chemical blend does not need additional heat
generating components to provide supplementary internal heat when it is externally
heated. Accordingly, the chemistry of the resulting slag is less complex, allowing for
a more straightforward recycling or disposal of the slag. In addition, when the
components of the chemical blend are selected to be stable at room temperature or
to prevent spontaneous ignition, the external heat source can be used to initiate the
extraction reaction without the use of ignition components.
[00116] In one embodiment, the externally heated extraction operation (200) can be
performed by using an inert atmosphere to prevent oxygen contamination of the
reaction products. For example, the extraction reaction may be perform under an
argon or helium atmosphere. An externally heated extraction reaction is not
dependent on the chemical blend to generate heat. Instead, the external heat source
provides the necessary heat that controls the extraction reaction. In addition, when
using external heat generators, the heat is more evenly distributed throughout the
blend as opposed to starting in a small, localized area and spreading through the
rest of the chemical blend as is the case when using ignition components. Externally

                                            22
heated extraction reactions allows the reaction products (i.e., metal and slag) to
separate more efficiently. Additionally, the reaction temperature can be controlled
more to provide only enough heat to drive the extraction reaction and avoid reaction
of the titanium product with the slag or reaction vessel. For example, in one
embodiment, the chemical blend is placed within the induction furnace and the
induction furnace is set to ramp up at a rate of 10*C/min. In other embodiments, the
ramp up rate is between 50C to 150C/min. In other embodiments, the ramp up rate is
between 500C and 125 0C/min. When the temperature of the chemical blend reaches
between 1525 and 16000C, the extraction reaction is initiated. As the induction
furnace ramps up toward a final temperature of 17250C, the extraction reaction
continues, and enough heat is generated during this phase of the heating profile to
separate the titanium product from the slag. Because both the titanium product and
slag are molten at this temperature, the slag, having a lower density, rises and
"floats" above the molten titanium product. In one embodiment, the temperature is
maintained at 17250C for between 10 and 20 minutes from the initiation of the
extraction reaction. In some embodiments, the final temperature is between 15000C
and 18000C and the reaction time is between 5 and 30 minutes. In other
embodiments, the final temperature is between 17000C and 17500C and the reaction
time is between 12 and 18 minutes. In some embodiments, the reaction time range
separates the titanium product from the slag and produces titanium metal yields of
between 85% and 95% based on the total amount of titanium in the titanium-bearing
ore concentrate. If the final temperature is maintained for less than 8 minutes, or if
the final temperature is less than 16500C, the extraction reaction will have less
titanium product/slag separation leading to lower titanium metal yields. If the final
temperature is above 18000C, or if the final temperature is maintained for more than
30 minutes, the extraction reaction will produce titanium products with higher levels
of contamination as the molten titanium product reacts with the reaction vessel and
the slag.
[00117] The ability to adjust the reaction temperature by an external heat source,
and controlling the duration of the period at the final temperature, allows more
flexibility when selecting chemical ratios for the extraction reaction and the type of

                                            23
chemical components used. This flexibility enables the efficient incorporation of a
wide range of raw ores into the process and improves the overall efficiency of the
production process.
[00118] FIGS. 3-10 illustrate embodiments of a titanium extraction system. As
illustrated in FIGS. 3-10, in one embodiment, a system for the extraction of titanium
metal (2) includes a reaction vessel, a heating source, and a power supply.
[00119] In one embodiment, the heating source is a resistive heating element. In
another embodiment, the heating source is an induction furnace having an induction
power generator (31) and a containment housing (30). The induction furnace is
capable of providing the needed amount of heat to initiate and maintain the chemical
reaction in the extraction operation (200) while allowing for fast heat dissipation. In
some embodiments, the use of an induction furnace provides the following
advantages: inductive heating takes the chemical blend (36) above the thermal
reaction threshold temperature in a short time period; uniform heating throughout the
chemical blend (36) avoids localized extraction reactions and provides good
metal/slag separation; and quick heat dissipation avoids contamination of the
titanium-product by reacting with the vessel walls and the slag.
[00120] In one embodiment, the containment housing (30) houses a susceptor
crucible (34) and/or the extraction vessel (37) and the induction power generator (31)
generates an induction field using an induction heating coil (33) to heat the chemical
blend (36) for the extraction operation (200). In one embodiment, the susceptor
crucible (34) does not come in direct contact with the chemical blend (36) and can be
made of a variety of materials that couple well with an induction field. For example,
refractory metals, such as molybdenum (Mo) and tungsten (W), and graphite (C)
work well as the susceptor crucible (34). In other embodiments, the extraction vessel
(37) contains the chemical blend (36) within the induction furnace and may be
constructed from a material that is compatible with or inert towards the chemical
blend (36) while able to withstand high temperature (e.g., melting point of titanium ~
16700C). Refractory metals, graphite, and ceramic materials may be used for the
extraction vessel (37). Additionally, in other embodiments, materials for the

                                             24
extraction vessel (37) may be chosen to be transparent to the induction field,
enabling metal within the chemical blend (36) to couple directly with the induction
field, thus providing heat for the reaction. Moreover, in some embodiments, magnetic
fields generated by the induction furnace can be effectively used to stir the reactants
in the chemical blend (36). In addition, in some embodiments, an insulator (35) may
be used to insulate the susceptor crucible (34) and/or the extraction vessel (37).
[00121] For example, as illustrated in FIGS. 3-4, the external heat source may be
embodied as an external induction heater having a containment housing (30),
induction generator (31), and direct current (DC) power supply (32). As illustrated in
FIGS. 5-6, an induction heating coil (33) surrounds a ceramic insulation cylinder (35)
and is used to heat the susceptor crucible (34) and extraction vessel (37) inside of
the ceramic insulation cylinder (35).
[00122] In one embodiment, an internally heated extraction reaction does not use an
external heat source and the extraction operation (200) requires only the extraction
vessel (37) to contain the chemical blend (37) as illustrated in FIG. 7.
[00123] FIGS. 8-9 illustrates a top view of the externally heated extraction
apparatus containing the chemical blend (36). As illustrated in FIGS. 8-9, the
chemical blend (36) is contained within an extraction vessel (37). The extraction
vessel (37) is surrounded by the susceptor crucible (34) and the ceramic insulation
sleeve (35). In some embodiments, additional insulator material (38) is disposed
between the susceptor crucible (34) and the ceramic insulation sleeve (35). The
ceramic insulation sleeve (35) is surrounded by the induction coil (33).
[00124] FIG. 10 is a cross-section illustration of the induction extraction apparatus
of FIGS. 5-9. As illustrated in FIG. 10, the induction coil (33) induces electrical eddy
currents within the susceptor crucible (34) to heat the extraction vessel (37). The
heat generated in the susceptor crucible (34) is transferred to the chemical blend
(36) within the extraction vessel (37) to initiate and maintain the chemical reaction
associated with the extraction operation (200). In some embodiments, the susceptor
crucible (34) may be metallic or graphite. For example, the susceptor crucible (34)

                                            25
may comprise a molybdenum (Mo) crucible 34. The susceptor crucible (34) with the
extraction vessel (37) and the induction heating coil (33) may be included within the
containment housing (30) to control a reaction atmosphere during the extraction
operation (200). In some embodiments, when the titanium product comprises
magnetic metals, such as iron, the susceptor crucible (34) may use molybdenum
(Mo) to shield the chemical blend from magnetic fields generated by the induction
furnace.
[00125] FIG. 11 is a cross-sectional cut of the extraction vessel (37) illustrating the
product of an externally heated extraction operation (200) showing the extraction
vessel bottom (40), titanium product (41), and slag (42). Note that the titanium
product (41) has coalesced at the bottom of the reaction vessel (37) with the slag
(42) having accumulated on top. Those skilled in the art will appreciate how this
method can be utilized to produce other metals, such as, but not limited to, iron,
chromium, copper, manganese, silicon, zirconium, etc. Ores of various metals can
be combined into tailored blends with carefully matched reducing agents, viscosity
controlling components, and heat generating components (if used in a self-heating
reaction) to produce the desired metal product.
[00126] The induction furnace may be based on a 10 KHz, 50 KW Ajax-Tocco
induction generator and a five turn copper coil as illustrated in FIGS. 5-10.
Capacitance and power settings are adjusted to reach a desired temperature in a
short amount of time. The susceptor crucible (34) is inside the coil (33) where it
couples with the induction field generating eddy currents that create heat. This heat
is transferred to the extraction reaction vessel (37) and the chemical blend (36).
Graphite can be used for the extraction reaction vessel (37). Graphite is relatively
inexpensive and any carbon that may adhere to the metal surface may be bead
blasted away leaving the clean metal surface.
[00127] Example 1
[00128] In one example of the present invention, a titanium product was extracted
from a titanium-bearing ore as follows. Ore-10 concentrate was ground in a ball mill

                                            26
to pass through a 200 mesh standard sieve (< 74 pm). A chemical blend was
prepared by blending 425g of the prepared ground Ore-1 0 ore concentrate, 230g of
aluminum powder, and 346g of calcium fluoride in a jar mill for 30 to 45 minutes to
achieve a uniform chemical blend (36). The chemical blend (36) was then charged
into a cylindrical graphite reaction vessel (3.63" d X 5.5" h) (37). The graphite
reaction vessel (37) containing the chemical blend (36) was then placed into a
graphite susceptor crucible (4.25" d x 4.75" h) (34) within the five turn copper
induction coil (33) of a 10 KHz, 50 KW Ajax-Tocco induction generator (31) and
placed into the containment housing (30). The containment housing (30) was closed
and purged with argon gas to displace oxygen from the system. The inert gas stream
was then set to a flow rate of 50 standard cubic feet per hour (SCFH) and
maintained throughout the remainder of the extraction operation (200). The induction
generator (31) was then activated to heat the chemical blend (36) to ~1 7250C at a
ramp up rate of 10*C/min and held at that temperature for 15 minutes. The induction
furnace was then allowed to cool to room temperature and the reaction products
were removed and prepared for analysis. FIG. 11 illustrates the titanium product
extracted from the Ore-1 0 of Example 1 (see Tables 1 and 2 for chemical
composition).
[00129] Example 2
[00130] In another example, a titanium metal product was extracted from a titanium
bearing ore with a high calcium content as follows. Ore-1 9 concentrate was ground
in a ball mill to pass through a 200 mesh standard sieve (< 74 pm). A chemical blend
was prepared by blending 439g of the ground Ore-1 9 concentrate, 237g of aluminum
powder, and 358g of calcium fluoride in a jar mill for 30 minutes to achieve a uniform
chemical blend (36). The chemical blend (36) (~ 1 Kg) was then charged into a
cylindrical graphite reaction vessel (3.63" d X 5.5" h) (37). The graphite reaction
vessel (37) containing the chemical blend (36) was then placed into a graphite
susceptor crucible (4.25" d x 4.75" h)(34) within the five turn copper induction coil
(33) of a 10 KHz, 50 KW Ajax-Tocco induction generator (31) and placed inside
containment housing (30). The containment housing (30) was closed and purged

                                             27
with argon gas to displace oxygen from the system. The inert gas stream was then
set to a flow rate of 50 standard cubic feet per hour (SCFH) and maintained
throughout the remainder of the extraction operation (200) The induction generator
(31) was then activated. A temperature ramp rate of 10*C/min was used to heat the
chemical blend (36) to ~1700*C. The reaction vessel and chemical blend were held
at that temperature for 20 minutes. The induction furnace was then cooled to room
temperature and the reaction products were removed and prepared for analysis.
Tables 1 and 2 contain the composition data for the Ore-1 9 concentrate and the
titanium product obtained therefrom.
[00131] Table 1 lists various titanium-bearing ore concentrates that have been used
to extract titanium products using extraction operation (200). Table 1 includes the
content of various oxides (wt % by X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Energy Dispersive
X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX)) in the titanium-bearing ore concentrates. As illustrated in
Table 1, many of the concentrates used in the extraction operation (200) contain
impurity levels or TiO 2 levels that would make them unsuitable for conventional
titanium extraction methods.

[00133] As illustrated in Table 2, titanium products with a high concentration of
titanium was produced via extraction operation (200). While the titanium products
from the extraction operation (200) may not have the titanium level necessary to
qualify as aerospace-grade titanium, they are well suited for other applications. For
example, automobiles, motorcycles, medical devices, bone implants, hand tools, and
armor plating use titanium products with the titanium concentrations listed on table 1.

                                             30
Moreover, subjecting these titanium products to refining operation (300) increases
the titanium level of the titanium products to aerospace-grade levels.
[00134] Example 3
[00135] As illustrated in FIG. 2, in one embodiment of the invention, a titanium
product was extracted from a titanium-bearing ore under an internally heated
extraction reaction (200) as follows. Anatase (TiO 2) ore concentrate was obtained
from Alfa Aesar (product # 36199) at a standard sieve size of < 325 mesh. A
chemical blend was prepared by blending 240g of the Anatase (TiO 2) ore
concentrate, 162g of aluminum powder, 106 g or sodium chlorite, and 157 g of
calcium fluoride in a jar mill for 30 minutes to achieve a uniform chemical blend. The
chemical blend was then charged into a cylindrical ceramic reaction vessel of
approximate dimensions (3" d X 4.5" h). The ceramic reaction vessel containing the
chemical blend was then buried part way in an earthen heat sink with the top of the
vessel approximately 1" above the surface. Five grams of KMnO 4 powder was
placed in one spot near the center, on top of the blend and approximately 2 mL of
glycerin was then poured onto the KMnO 4. After about 20 seconds the
KMnO 4/glycerin mix began to burn which, in turn, initiated the extraction reaction.
After the vessel had cooled for several hours, the titanium product was removed
from the slag and prepared for analysis. FIG. 2 illustrates the titanium product
produced in Example 3. The certificate of analysis data for the Anatase ore
concentrate lists the composition to be predominately TiO 2 with very small levels (<
0.001 wt %) of the following impurities: Al, Cd, Cu, K, Mg, Pb, V, Ca, Cr, Fe, Li, Na
and Si. Data from EDX analysis of the titanium product extracted from the Anatase
ore concentrate indicate a weight percentage of: 71.2% Ti, 16.1% 0, 12.1%
Aluminum, and 0.6% Mn.
[00136] For applications that do not require a high titanium level, the titanium
product extracted in operation (200) can be further processed into a final product in
operation (500). For applications where a higher titanium level is required, the
titanium product from the extraction operation (200) may be subject to further refining
in operation (300).

                                             31
[00137] In one embodiment of the present invention, the titanium product extracted
in operation (200) may be further refined in operation (300) to remove unwanted
elements and/or increase the titanium level. In another embodiment, titanium from
other sources may be refined using the refining operation (300). In another
embodiment, titanium from other sources may be combined with the titanium product
extracted in operation (200) for refining operation (300). In one embodiment, the
refining operation (300) incorporates titanium scrap from other sources (recycling
operation 400). For example, in one embodiment, the present invention processes
titanium metals and scrap having between 25% and 95% titanium content, and up to
20% oxygen content. In another embodiment, the refining operation (300) is able to
process titanium scrap with up to 6% oxygen content. For example, in one
embodiment, off-grade titanium sponge may be used as a feed material for the
refining process of operation (300) by itself, or in addition to the titanium product
obtained in operation (200) under recycling operation (400). Refined titanium
products that emerge from the refining operation (300) have an improved titanium
level relative to the feed materials. Impurities such as oxygen, iron, carbon, and
silicon are removed from the titanium feed materials used during the refining
operation (300).
[00138] In one embodiment of the present invention, refining of the titanium
products in operation (300) is done via electrochemical refining. For example, in one
embodiment, in operation (300) the titanium product obtained through the extraction
operation (200) and/or obtained from other sources (operation 500) is placed in a
reaction vessel having a cathode and an anode. An electrolyte capable of dissolving
titanium ions is placed in the reaction vessel and heated to subject the titanium
product to an electro-refining process in operation (300). In one embodiment of the
present invention, the refining operation (300) is done under an inert atmosphere. In
another embodiment, the refining operation (300) is done in batches.
[00139] In one embodiment of the invention, the anode is a non-consumable anode.
In another embodiment, the distance between the anode and the cathode is
adjustable during the refining operation (300). Adjusting the distance between the

                                            32
cathode and anode prevents the anode-cathode from shorting-out as titanium ions
are deposited on the cathode and allows the maintenance of an optimum distance
between the cathode and the anode throughout the refining operation (300). The
electrolyte used during the refining operation (300) may include halide salts of alkali
metals or alkali-earth metals or a combination of both to produce a chemical melt in
the range of 6000C to 9000C. If the temperature of the chemical melt is above 9000C,
the evaporation rate of the electrolyte may be too high.
[00140] In one embodiment of the invention, a resistive element furnace or an
induction furnace can be used to heat the electrolyte. In another embodiment, the
external heat source used in operation (200) may be used to heat the electrolyte in
operation (300).
[00141] While induction heating is not typically used to heat electrochemical
processes because of the concern that the magnetic induction field may interfere
with the electric field between the electrodes or affect metallic components in the
chemical melt. For example when the titanium product is derived from a titanium
bearing ore including iron, the iron ions in the chemical melt may be attracted by the
magnetic fields generated during the refining operation (300). However, the inventors
have discovered that induction heating can be used for the refining operation (300)
according to embodiments of the present invention without noticeable effects.
[00142] The refining operation (300) may use lower grade titanium products than
are considered unsuitable for conventional methods due to high levels of oxygen. As
titanium is recycled (scrapped) the oxygen content increases upon each re-melt
which ultimately disqualifies it from being used in applications that require high
titanium levels (e.g., the aerospace industry). In one embodiment, the refining
operation (300) can reduce the oxygen level to make high titanium level products
from titanium scrap or off-grade titanium sponge. For example, in one embodiment of
the present invention, the refining operation (300) can process titanium products or
scrap having less than 20% oxygen by weight. In another embodiment, the refining
operation (300) can process titanium products or scrap having less than 6% oxygen
by weight.

                                            33
[00143] In one embodiment, the refining operation (300) is environmentally safe
and low-cost. It does not use hazardous chemicals or produce greenhouse gases,
such as C02.
[00144] After the refining operation (operation 300), the resulting refined titanium
product can be further processed into a final product in operation (500).
[00145] According to one embodiment of the present invention, the refining
operation (300) produces a refined titanium product with a fine structured, dendritic
morphology. For example, the titanium product may comprise titanium crystallites
that have deposited on the cathode during the electro-refining operation (300). FIGS.
18-19 illustrate a refined titanium product having a dendritic form (titanium wool).
FIG. 18 illustrates an unmagnified digital image and FIG. 19 illustrates a SEM
micrograph of the refined titanium product. The fine dendritic structure of the titanium
product is new to the titanium market and uniquely provides a pathway for near-net
shaped parts through hydraulic compression and subsequent sintering without the
aid of a binding agent. For example, in one embodiment, the refined titanium product
has a surface area of at least 0.1 m2 /g In another embodiment, the refined titanium
product has a surface area between 0.1 m2 /g and 2.5 m2/g. In another embodiment,
the refined titanium product has a surface area between 0.4 m2 /g and 2.0 m2/g. In
another embodiment, the refined titanium product has a surface area of 1.8 m2/g.
[00146] Due to the small size and delicate nature of the refined titanium product,
near-net-shaped products can be compressed for further processing in operation
(500). For example, in one embodiment, the dendritic form of the refined titanium
product (titanium wool) can be compressed by using hydraulic pressure. To
accomplish this, the titanium wool is placed into a compression mold of desired
shape. The mold is then placed into a hydraulic press where between 35 to 65
tons/in 2 is applied. This procedure can produce near-net shaped titanium parts that
can then be sintered, used as consumable electrodes in a vacuum arc remelt (VAR)
process, melted or further processed depending on the product application. FIGS. 22
and 23 respectively illustrate a titanium product puck and titanium product cylinder
(green compacts) formed by hydraulic compression of the dendritic titanium wool

                                             34
produced through the extraction operation (200) and the refining operation (300)
according to embodiments of the present invention. As illustrated in FIGS. 22 and
23, the titanium product puck and cylinder fashioned by compressing titanium wool
conform into the intended shapes. Unlike traditional titanium powders, in some
embodiments, the titanium wool produced from the refining operation (300) can be
compressed without the aid of a binding agent. In other embodiments, the
compressed titanium wool can be sintered to increase their density. For example,
green compacts (compacts of titanium wool that have not been sintered) have
densities of 85% to 88% of the full density of titanium (4.5 g/cm 3). After sintering the
green compacts of titanium wool produced from the extraction operation (200) and
the refining operation (300) at temperatures from 12200C to 13500C, the resulting
compacts densities range from 95% to 97% of full density. FIG. 24 is a section of a
titanium puck that has been pressed, sintered, and polished. As illustrated in FIG.
24, the present invention provides a method of extracting and refining titanium
bearing ores into titanium wool to produce near-net shaped parts by compression
and subsequent sintering procedures.
[00147] In addition, under other embodiments of the invention, the refining
operation (300) produces a refined titanium product with a high surface area
(1.8m 2/g). Therefore, this refined titanium product can be used to make high surface
area electrodes where applications requires high surface area (e.g. conduct electro
catalytic reaction).
[00148] FIGS. 13-17 illustrate examples of a refining apparatus according to
embodiments of the present invention. As illustrated in FIGS. 13-15, in one
embodiment, a refining apparatus may include a reaction vessel (50), a cathode
(51), and an anode (52). The anode (52) may be embodied as a perforated
basket/container made from quartz or more noble metals than titanium (e.g., nickel
or iron) to hold the titanium product garnered from the extraction operation (200)
and/or titanium metal (e.g., off-grade titanium sponge) added through operation
(400). The reaction vessel (50) holds the cathode (51), the anode (52), and an

                                             35
electrolyte (53) which are used to subject the titanium product to an electro-refining
process.
[00149] FIGS. 16 and 17 illustrate another example of a refining apparatus
according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in FIGS. 16 and
17, in another embodiment, a refining apparatus may include a reaction vessel (56),
a cathode (54), and an anode (55). The anode (55) is a movable perforated
basket/container made from nickel, iron or metals more noble than titanium to hold
the titanium product garnered from the extraction operation (200) and/or titanium
(e.g., off-grade titanium sponge) added through operation (400). The reaction vessel
(56) holds the cathode (54) in the bottom, the anode (55) suspended above the
cathode (54), and an electrolyte (53) which are used to subject the titanium product
to an electro-refining process. Having the ability to adjust the distance between the
cathode (54) and the anode (55) prevents the anode-cathode from shorting-out as
titanium ions are deposited on the cathode and dendrites grow, allowing the
maintenance of an optimum distance between the cathode and the anode
throughout the refining operation (300).
For example, in one embodiment, the cathode (54) to anode (55) distance is
between 2cm and 4cm.
[00150] An electrolyte (53) used during the refining operation (300) may include
halide salts of alkali metals or alkali-earth metals or a combination of both to produce
a melt in the range of 6000C to 9000C. A resistive element furnace or an induction
furnace can be used to heat the electrolyte. In the present invention, both types of
furnaces (resistive element and induction) have been used. In one embodiment,
when using an induction furnace, a molybdenum susceptor crucible (34) was used to
couple with the induction field in order to generate heat that was transmitted to the
electrolyte blend. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, the induction
furnace (31) used during operation (200) may be used during operation (300).
Titanium products from the extraction operation (200), titanium scrap, or other metal
pieces to be refined are placed into a perforated basket and used as the anode (52)
in the electronic circuit by connecting a lead to the positive (+) side of an electric

                                             36
power supply, such as power supply (32). In one embodiment, metal foil can be
placed around the inside of the reaction vessel (50) and used as the cathode (51) by
connecting it to the negative (-) side of the electric power supply. In one
embodiment, during operation (300), the impure titanium metal is oxidized (ionized)
and titanium ions migrate to the cathode (51) where they are reduced to form
titanium metal crystals or a dense titanium layer to make the refined titanium
product. In some embodiments, impurities are concentrated (left behind) in the
anode basket (52) or remain in the molten electrolyte (53).
[00151] Alternatively, in another embodiment, a cathode (54) in the form of a metal
plate can be placed parallel to the bottom of the reaction vessel with the anode
basket (55) suspended above the plate (54). In this configuration, the optimum
distance between the cathode plate (54) and the anode basket (55) can be
maintained by moving the anode basket vertically throughout the refining operation
(300). The cathode (54) is connected to the negative (-) side of the power supply by
the lead (57) and the anode (55) is connected to the positive (+) side of the power
supply. In one embodiment, the cathode (54) to anode (55) distance is between 2cm
and 4cm. While FIGS. 13-17 illustrate embodiments of the electro-refining cell, the
present invention is not limited thereto, and other configurations for the electro
purification cell are possible.
[00152] Example 4
[00153] A titanium metal product obtained through operation (200) was refined
through refining operation (300) as follows: 160g of titanium product was placed
inside a perforated 100ml quartz anode basket (52). The anode basket with titanium
product pieces (52) was then placed into the center of the reaction vessel (50) made
from quartz (volume - 800ml) filled with 650g of an alkali halide salt blend (53) of
sodium chloride (NaCI) and Potassium Chloride (KCI) at a 44:56 NACLKCI weight
per cent ratio and surrounded by a metal foil cathode (51) made from molybdenum
(Mo) (see FIGS. 13 and 15). The mixture of alkali halide salts was blended to
produce a molten salt electrolyte (53) at a temperature of approximately 6500C. The
refining apparatus was placed into the containment housing (30) and the electrodes

                                            37
were connected to the power supply (32). The containment housing (30) was purged
with argon gas and heated to about 8500C.
[00154] Electro-refining was carried out by using an applied DC potential of 1.3
volts at a temperature of 7500C. In some embodiments, the refining process is
carried out at a temperature 100C higher than the melting point of the salt blend to
insure a complete melt and to avoid changes in the melting point due to salt loss
from evaporation. In other embodiments, the electrical differential is between 0.5 and
2.5 volts or between 1.0 and 1.6 volts. After 9 hours, the refining vessel (50) was
cooled to room temperature. The average cathode current density calculated was
0.03 A/cm 2 . The frozen electrolyte salt was removed from the refined titanium
product by washing with deionized water. Example 4 produced 34.Og of refined
titanium product (titanium wool) representing an 85% of theoretical yield. The final
product was then dried and prepared for analysis and further processing. IGF
analysis indicates that the oxygen level of refined titanium product was as low as
2000 parts per million (ppm).
[00155] Table 3 summarizes the composition results of various titanium products
obtained from extraction operation (200) before and after the refining operation
(300). As illustrated in Table 3, elemental impurities are removed or significantly
reduced during the refining operation (300) from titanium metal products obtained
from titanium-bearing ore concentrates having TiO 2 , such as Rutile.

                                               38
[00156] In some embodiments of the invention, the only impurity remaining after the
refining operation (300) is aluminum, which was introduced during the extraction
operation (200) as the reducing agent. However, because the most commonly used
titanium containing metal in today's aerospace and many other industries is an alloy
containing aluminum, referred to as Ti-6Al-4V, titanium products with aluminum are
readily usable in today's industry. For example, Ti-6Al-4V contains 90% by weight
titanium (Ti), 6% aluminum (AI), and 4% vanadium (V). Data from Table 3 indicates
that, in some embodiments, titanium products obtained from the refining operation
(300) can be used as the base metal for producing Ti-6Al-4V if vanadium were
incorporated into the titanium product.
[00157] In other embodiments of the present invention, the refining operation (300)
can also provide titanium coatings on non-conductive material surfaces, such as
quartz (SiO 2 ) and alumina (A12 0 3 ), by placing the non-conductive material between
cathode (51) and anode (52). FIGS. 20-21 illustrate titanium coatings formed during
the refining operation (300). FIG. 20 illustrates a titanium coating deposited onto a
quartz substrate and FIG. 21 illustrates a titanium coating deposited on an alumina
tube.
[00158] Table 4 lists EDX data illustrating the titanium level of coating deposited on
quartz substrate during various runs of operation (300). The chlorine level in Table 4
is due to incomplete rinsing of the electrolyte from the refined titanium product.
