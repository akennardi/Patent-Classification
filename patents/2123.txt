                                                   ABSTRACT
A tibial insert includes a base and a post extending from the base along a
longitudinal axis. The post has a medial surface, a lateral surface, and a height
along the longitudinal axis. The medial surface has a medial section, and the
lateral surface has a lateral section oriented substantially parallel to the medial
section. The medial section and the lateral section each have a width in a
substantially anterior-posterior direction that is sufficient to enable varus/valgus
constraint over a flexion/extension range from extension to about 90 to 120
degrees of flexion when the tibial insert is mated with a femoral component.

              This is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, which in turn is a
   divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2012211099, the entire contents of which are

 5 CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
              This application claims priority to and the full benefit of United States Provisional
   Application Serial Number 61/436,778, filed January 27, 2011, and titled "Constrained Knee
   Prosthesis," the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
   TECHNICAL FIELD
10               This disclosure relates to knee prostheses.
   BACKGROUND
              Total knee replacement systems often include a tibial implant and a femoral implant that
   replace the articular surfaces of the knee. Posterior-stabilized knee replacement systems can
   be used to replace the function of both the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior
15 cruciate ligament (PCL). In some instances, posterior-stabilized knee replacement systems
   include varus/valgus constraint to also replace the function of the medial collateral ligament
   (MCL) and the lateral collateral ligament (LCL). Although a constrained knee replacement
   system can provide needed stability, it often introduces biomechanical inefficiencies.
   SUMMARY
20            In a general aspect, a tibial insert provides varus/valgus constraint and permits
   tibiofemoral rotation. The tibial insert includes a post having walls configured to engage a
   femoral component over a flexion/extension range from extension to about 90 to about 120
   degrees flexion. The post has rounded edges that permit tibiofemoral rotation when the post is
   in contact with the femoral component.
25            In another general aspect, a tibial insert includes a base and a post extending from
   the base along a longitudinal axis. The post has a medial surface, a lateral surface, and
   height along the longitudinal axis. The medial surface has a medial section, and the lateral
   surface has a lateral section oriented substantially parallel to the medial section. The
   medial section and the lateral section each have a width in a substantially anterior
30 posterior direction that is sufficient to enable varus/valgus constraint over a

   flexion/extension range from extension to about 90 to 120 degrees of flexion when the
   tibial insert is mated with a femoral component.
            Implementations can include one or more of the following features. For example,
   the femoral component defines an opening for receiving the post between substantially
 5 parallel walls, the opening providing a clearance of approximately 0.005 inches to
   approximately 0.030 inches between the post and the substantially parallel inner walls
   when the post is received in the opening. The medial section and the lateral section each
   extend such that, along at least half of the height of the post, the width of the medial
   section and width of the lateral section in the substantially anterior-posterior direction at a
10 given axial position along the longitudinal axis is between approximately one sixth and
   approximately two thirds of a largest width of the post in the substantially anterior
   posterior direction at that axial position. The post has a proximal surface that is
   substantially flat and a notch defined in a superior anterior portion of the post. At least a
   portion of the notch is defined completely through the post along a medial-lateral
15 direction. The medial section and the lateral section are substantially flat and are oriented
   along the substantially anterior-posterior direction. For substantially the entire height of
   the post, at a given axial position, the width of the medial surface and the width of the
   lateral surface in the substantially anterior-posterior direction are between approximately
   one sixth and two thirds of the largest width of the post in the substantially anterior
20 posterior direction at that axial position. The average length of the medial surface in an
   axial direction is more than twice the average length of the medial surface in the
   substantially anterior-posterior direction, and the average length of the lateral surface in
   an axial direction is more than twice the average length of the lateral surface in the
   substantially anterior-posterior direction. The post is twisted along the axis of the post
25 such that a superior portion of the post is rotationally offset from an inferior portion of
   the post. The post is rotationally offset from the base such that the medial surface and the
   lateral surface are oriented at an angle with respect to medial and lateral sides of the base.
   The post has an anterior surface and a posterior surface, and the anterior surface and the
   posterior surface each have a convex portion. The post has rounded edges between the
30  anterior surface and the medial and lateral surfaces and between the posterior surface and
                                                  2

   the medial and lateral surfaces. The rounded edges have a radius of between
   approximately 0.030 and 0.090 inches.
            In another general aspect, a method of operation of a knee prosthesis includes
   permitting flexion/extension of the knee prosthesis over a flexion/extension range of
 5 approximately 0 to 150 degrees, constraining varus/valgus alignment of the knee
   prosthesis over a constrained flexion/extension range from extension to about 90 to 120
   degrees of flexion, and rotating a tibial insert of the knee prosthesis relative to a femoral
   component of the kmee prosthesis about a substantially superior-inferior axis of the tibial
   insert over at least a portion of the constrained flexion/extension range.
10          In another general aspect, a method of trialing a tibial insert of a knee prosthesis
   includes coupling a first tibial insert to a prepared tibia or a tibial tray, assessing the
   suitability of the knee prosthesis, and removing the first tibial insert from the prepared
   tibia or the tibial tray. The method includes coupling a second tibial insert to the
   prepared tibia or the tibial tray. The second tibial insert is configured to permit
15 flexion/extension of the knee prosthesis over a flexion/extension range of approximately
   0 to 150 degrees, constrain varus/valgus alignment of the knee prosthesis over a
   constrained flexion/extension range from extension to about 90 to 120 degrees of flexion
   when the tibial insert mated with a femoral component, and rotate the tibial insert of the
   kmee prosthesis relative to the femoral component about a substantially superior-inferior
20 axis of the tibial insert over at least a portion of the constrained flexion/extension range.
            Implementations can include one or more of the following features. For example,
   the first tibial insert and the second tibial insert each have a post, and the first tibial insert
   and the second tibial insert have differing post dimensions.
            In another general aspect, a prosthesis includes a femoral component that defines
25 an opening between substantially parallel inner walls and a tibial insert having a base and
   a post extending from the base. The post has a medial surface and a lateral surface, and is
   configured to be received in the opening. The medial surface has a medial section, and
   the lateral surface has a lateral section oriented substantially parallel to the medial
   section. The medial section and the lateral section each have a width in a substantially
30 anterior-posterior direction that is sufficient to constrain varus/valgus alignment of the
                                                    3

   prosthesis over a flexion/extension range from extension to about 90 to 120 degrees of
   flexion when the tibial insert is mated with the femoral component such that the post is
   received in the opening and the medial section and the lateral section each engage one of
   the substantially parallel inner walls. Engagement of the tibial insert and the femoral
 5 component rotates the tibial insert relative to the femoral component over at least a
   portion of the constrained flexion/extension range.
             Implementations can include one or more of the following features. For example,
   the post is dimensioned to provide a total clearance of approximately 0.005 to
   approximately 0.030 inches between the post and the substantially parallel inner walls
10 when the post is received in the opening. The post has a posterior surface and an anterior
   surface, and the post has rounded edges between the anterior surface and the medial and
   lateral surfaces and between the posterior surface and the medial and lateral surfaces.
   The base has a medial bearing surface having a concave portion and a lateral bearing
   surface having a concave portion. The concave portion of the medial bearing surface is
15 positioned anteriorly offset from a center of the base and has a maximum depth in a
   superior-inferior direction that is more inferior than a maximum depth of the concave
   portion of the lateral bearing surface in the'superior-inferior direction. The post has a
   posterior surface, and the femoral component has an asymmetrical posterior cam
   configured to engage the posterior surface to drive rotation of the tibial insert relative to
20 the femoral component. The posterior cam is configured to engage the posterior surface
    at angles of flexion that are greater than a first angle that is between approximately 60
    and approximately 90 degrees of flexion, and the posterior cam is configured to not
    engage the posterior surface at angles of flexion less than the first angle.

15                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
           Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a knee prosthesis 100 provides varus/valgus constraint
   and also permits internal and external rotation of the tibia relative to the femur. To
   achieve this, the knee prosthesis 100 includes a tibial insert 300 shaped to engage a
   femoral component 200 to (i) limit varus-valgus deviation of the tibia from its proper
20 alignment with the femur, and (ii) facilitate rotation of the tibia relative to the femur
   during flexion. The tibial insert 300 can be referred to as a constrained insert, being
   constrained by the femoral component 200 in the assembled knee prosthesis 100.
            During flexion of a healthy knee, the tibia rotates a small amount about its
   longitudinal axis (internal-external rotation). The knee prosthesis 100 enables this
25 rotation helping to preserve a natural feel to the reconstructed knee. Internal rotation of
   the tibia relative to the femur (tibiofemoral rotation) aligns the line of action of the
   quadriceps and the tibia, improving the efficiency the quadriceps compared to an
   unaligned knee system. Proper alignment also reduces sheer forces on the patella and can
                                                    5

   improve the longevity of the knee prosthesis 100. The tibia rotates internally relative to
   the femur as the knee is flexed, and rotates externally relative to the femur as the knee is
   extended. The knee prosthesis 100 can also replace the function of the MCL and/or LCL
   in addition to the functions of the ACL and PCL, with the tibial insert 300 restricting
 5 varus/valgus forces on the knee.
           In general, the possible movements of a tibia relative to a femur can be considered
   to include movements about three different axes. As a result of flexion and extension of
   the knee, the tibia moves relative to the femur about a medial-lateral axis through the
   knee. Varus/valgus motion refers to movement of the tibia and the femur about an
10 anterior-posterior axis through the knee, for example, movement that causes the leg to
   bow medially or laterally. Axial rotation of the femur can occur relative to a longitudinal
   axis of the tibia (for example, an axis parallel to the shaft of the tibia, such as an axis
   along a substantially superior-inferior direction).
           As used herein, tibiofemoral rotation refers to the axial rotation of the femur with
15 respect to the longitudinal axis of the tibia, commonly referred to as internal and external
   rotation. In use, the knee prosthesis 100 restricts varus/valgus movement (for example,
   constrains varus/valgus movement to a particular range of motion or laxity) while causing
   tibiofemoral rotation to occur during flexion and extension.
           The knee prosthesis 100 for a left knee includes the femoral component 200 for
20 mounting to a distal end of a femur and the tibial insert 300 for attachment to a proximal
   end of a tibia. The tibial insert 300 can be attached to the tibia by known methods.
           The femoral component 200 includes medial and lateral walls 210, 211 that define
   an opening 212 in the femoral component 200. The walls 210, 211 include substantially
   flat, substantially parallel inner surfaces 213, 215. Located at the anterior portion 224 of
25 the walls 210, 211, the femoral component 200 includes an anterior cam 214 (Fig. 2).
   The femoral component 200 also includes a posterior cam 216 located at a superior
   posterior portion 226 of the walls 210, 211. The posterior cam 216 includes an uneven
   thickness, such that a lateral portion 222 of the posterior cam 216 is thicker than a medial
   portion 220.
                                                   6

             The femoral component 200 includes a medial condylar portion 201 with a medial
     condylar surface 202. The femoral component also includes a lateral condylar portion
     203 and a lateral condylar surface 204. The medial condylar surface 202 and the lateral
     condylar surface 204 are rounded, and in some implementations, can be asymmetrical.
 5 . Between the medial condylar surface 202 and the lateral condylar surface 204, the
     femoral component 200 defines a trochlear groove 206 over which a patella or a patellar
     implant can glide during flexion of the knee.
              The tibial insert 300 includes a base 301 and a raised section or post 302,
     extending from a substantially central location of a proximal surface 303 of the tibial
10   insert 300. The post 302 extends from the base along a longitudinal axis, X, for example,
     an axis that extends in a substantially superior-inferior direction. The post 302 includes a
     medial surface 304, a lateral surface 306, an anterior surface 308, a posterior surface 310,
     and a proximal surface 312. When the femoral component 200 and the tibial component
     300 are coupled, the post 302 is received within the opening 212 between the anterior
15   cam 214 and the posterior cam 216. The medial surface 304 and the lateral surface 306
     include substantially parallel, substantially flat contact sections 322, 320 (Figs. 6 and 7)
     to contact the inner surfaces 213, 215 of the walls 210, 211 of the femoral component
     200. The anterior surface 308 is convex in an anterior direction and the posterior surface
     310 is convex in a posterior direction.
20            The proximal surface 312 is substantially flat, and the post 302 defines a notch
      314, or patella relief, at its superior anterior portion. The notch 314 provides clearance
     for the patella or a patellar implant in deep flexion. The notch 314 may have a spherical
     radius similar to the spherical radius of patella implants available for use in the implant
      system. At least a portion of the notch 314 is defined completely through the post 302
25    along a substantially medial-lateral direction, for example, from the medial surface 304 to
     the lateral surface 306.
              The tibial insert 300 also includes a medial bearing surface 316 and a lateral
      bearing surface 318 having sloped, concave portions that engage the medial condylar
      surface 202 and the lateral condylar surface 204, respectively.
                                                        7

             The tibial insert 300 can be formed, for example, of high molecular weight
   polyethylene. Tibial trial inserts can be made of a sterilizable plastic, for example, a
   thermoplastic such as polyoxymethylene (acetal). Tibial trial inserts approximate the
   shape and dimensions of corresponding tibial inserts for implantation. Generally, the
 5 tibial trial inserts can be sterilized for reuse.
            As described further below, in some implementations, the knee prosthesis 100
   permits flexion/extension over a flexion/extension range of approximately 0 to 150
   degrees of flexion. The knee prosthesis 100 constrains varus/valgus alignment of the
   knee prosthesis 100 over a constrained flexion/extension range from extension (or
10 hyperextension) to about 90 to 120 degrees of flexion. In use, the tibial insert 300 rotates
   relative to the femoral component 200, resulting in tibiofemoral rotation over at least a
   portion of the constrained flexion/extension range. The tibial insert 300 and the femoral
   component 200 can rotate relative to each other over one or more portions of the
   constrained flexion/extension range or over the entire constrained flexion/extension
15 range. The tibiofemoral rotation optionally occurs over a flexion/extension range of
   approximately 0 to 150 degrees of flexion. The rotation occurs about the axis of the tibia,
   which is in a direction about a substantially superior-inferior axis of the tibial insert such
   as the longitudinal axis, X, of the post 302. Translation of the tibial insert 300 relative to
   the femoral component 200 can also occur during the rotation, as described below.
20           Constraining varus/valgus alignment of the knee prosthesis 100 includes, for
   example, resisting medial and lateral forces on the knee prosthesis 100. In this manner,
   the knee prosthesis 100 supplements or replaces the functions of the MCL and/or the
   LCL. The knee prosthesis 100 can limit the varus/valgus alignment to a range of
    acceptable alignments, or limit deviation from a particular varus/valgus alignment to a
25 predetermined range. In use, for example, the knee prosthesis 100 constrains the tibia
    and femur to a predetermined range of positions or range of angles relative to each other.
    The knee prosthesis 100 can provide constraint while permitting some varus/valgus
   movement of the knee within the predetermined range. The knee prosthesis 100 can
    constrain varus/valgus alignment or varus/valgus movement or to a range the same as or
30  similar to a range of varus/valgus alignments or varus/valgus movement typical of
    healthy knees. In some implementations, the knee prosthesis 100 restricts varus/valgus
                                                     8

   deviation of the tibia and the femur to a total of 5 degrees or less, or a total of 1 degree or
   less, from a desired laxity. The desired varus/valgus laxity range of motion can be
   approximately 5 degrees. In some implementations, varus/valgus movement may be
   disallowed entirely.
 5          During surgery to implant the knee prosthesis 100, a physician couples a tibial
   trial insert to a prepared tibia or tibial tray. The physician assesses the suitability of the
   size of the tibial trial insert by, for example, coupling and removing various tibial trial
   inserts to identify a tibial insert 300 most appropriate for the patient. The physician can
   perform a trial range of motion of the knee prosthesis 100 using a tibial trial insert. This
10 permits the physician to assess the performance and stability of the tibial trial insert and
   to evaluate the behavior and function of ligaments and other tissues in cooperation with
   the knee prosthesis 100. The physician can assess, for example, whether the tibial trial
   insert sufficiently constrains varus/valgus alignment for the patient when engaged with
   the femoral component, and whether the tibial trial insert permits a sufficient range of
15 tibiofemoral rotation.
            As an example, a physician may trial a tibial trial insert that does not constrain
   varus/valgus motion or position, but permits flexion/extension over a flexion/extension
   range of approximately 0 to 150 degrees and rotates the tibial insert relative to the
   femoral component over a portion of or all of a flexion/extension range of approximately
20 0 to 150 degrees.
            Through the trialing process, the physician may determine that additional
   constraint is appropriate. For example, the physician may determine that the patient
   presents with a lax or over-released medial collateral ligament (MCL). In response, the
   physician can trial a variety of tibial trial inserts that constrain varus/valgus alignment
25 and also permit tibiofemoral rotation. The tibial trial inserts can have varying post 302
   dimensions or varying dimensions of contact portions 320, 322, to provide varying levels
   of varus/valgus constraint and varying ranges of tibiofemoral rotation. For example, the
   physician may trial one or more different tibial trial inserts that each constrain
   varus/valgus alignment over a constrained flexion/extension range from extension (or
30 hyperextension) to about 90 to 120 degrees flexion, permit flexion/extension over a
                                                     9

   flexion/extension range of approximately 0 to 150 degrees, and rotate relative to a
   femoral component over at least a portion of the constrained range when mated to the
   femoral component.
            After a tibial trial insert has been determined to have an appropriate size and
 5 performance characteristics, the physician removes the tibial trial insert and in its place,
   couples a tibial insert 300 having the same size and features as the tibial trial insert to the
   tibia or tibial tray.
            In some implementations, a library of tibial trial inserts (for example, a set of
   multiple tibial trial inserts) is provided for use during surgery. The tibial trial inserts in
10 the library can have different post dimensions. For example, different tibial trial inserts
   can have different clearances relative to the femoral component 200, resulting in different
   levels of stability and tibiofemoral rotation. Additionally or alternatively, the different
   tibial trial inserts can also have different radii of curvature at the corners of the post,
   different post heights, different widths or shapes of medial and lateral surfaces (e.g.,
15 different contact sections 322, 320), different medial and lateral bearing surfaces, and
   other variations. Information about the stability and tibiofemoral rotation characteristics
   of the tibial trial inserts in the library are provided to the surgeon. The surgeon selects a
   trial insert from the library to achieve an appropriate balance of stability and tibiofemoral
   rotation for a particular patient. For example, the surgeon selects one or more tibial trial
20 inserts that have stability and tibiofemoral rotation characteristics that match the needs
   indicated by patient data.
             The level of stability (for example, the degree of stabilization or constraint)
   needed in the reconstructed knee can be predicted using pre-surgical laxity data, for
   example, data that indicates a relationship between an applied load and the resulting
25 varus-valgus rotation of the knee. A load can be applied by, for example, a device
   attached to the patient or by a medical professional with a hand-held load measuring
   instrument. A desired amount of tibiofemoral rotation for the reconstructed knee can also
   be determined using pre-surgical data. For example, imaging techniques, such as
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and X-ray imaging, can
30 be used to measure changes in a distance between the tibia and femur at different
                                                     10

   positions of the knee. Motion of the knee can also be tracked using image-based motion
   capture techniques, electromagnetic motion capture techniques, or mechanical linkages
   attached to the knee to measure the angular changes in knee position.
            In the assembled knee prosthesis 100, engagement between the post 302 and the
 5 walls 210, 211 constrains varus/valgus alignment by limiting medial and lateral deviation
   of the tibial insert 300, that is, limiting tilting of the tibial insert 300 relative to the
   femoral component 200 in the direction of arrow B. To provide effective constraint, the
   contact sections 322, 320 of the medial surface 304 and the lateral surface 306 have a
   length, L1 , of, for example, between approximately 0.550 and approximately 0.870
10 inches. The walls 210, 211 of the femoral component 200 have a height in a superior
   inferior direction that is, for example, at least as long as the length, L1 .
            In addition, the contact sections 322, 320 have a width, W, in an anterior-posterior
   direction of, for example, between approximately 0.125 and approximately 0.225 inches.
   The contact sections 322, 320 have a somewhat rectangular shape, so that the width, W,
15 of the contact sections 322, 320 at the superior portion 307 of the post 302 is substantially
   the same as the width at the inferior portion 305 of the post 302. The width, W, is
   sufficient to enable varus/valgus constraint over a flexion/extension range from extension
   (or hyperextension) to about 90 to 120 degrees flexion when the tibial insert 300 is mated
   with the femoral component 200.
20          The contact sections 322, 320 optionally have a somewhat trapezoidal shape. For
   example, a largest anterior-posterior width of the contact sections 322, 320 can be located
   at an inferior portion of the contact sections 322, 320, and the anterior-posterior width
   can decrease in a superior direction from the largest width. A posterior boundary or edge
   of the contact sections 322, 320 can extend in a substantially superior-inferior direction,
25 such that the changing anterior-posterior width results in a sloped anterior boundary or
   edge.
            The height, H, of the post 302 and the length, Li, of the contact sections 322, 320
   affect the degree of varus/valgus constraint achieved. A higher post 302 provides contact
   with the walls 210, 211 over a greater distance along the length of the post 302, providing
30 more effective constraint. Consequently, in some implementations, the post 302 is
                                                     11

   substantially the same height as the walls 210, 211. In some implementations, the height,
   H, of the post 302 is between approximately 0.720 and 0.990 inches.
           In extension of the knee, the anterior surface 308 of the post 302 may engage the
   anterior cam 214 to provide anterior stabilization. Also, in extension, the contact sections
 5 322, 320 can contact the walls 210, 211 to provide varus/valgus constraint at angles of
   flexion between extension or hyperextension and approximately 90 to 120 degrees. By
   contrast, in flexion of the knee, for example, at angles of flexion of approximately 125
   degrees and higher, the medial surface 304 and lateral surface 306 would no longer be
   fully constrained between the walls 210, 211.
10         Extension corresponds to a position in which a leg is straight, for example, at zero
   degrees of flexion. Hyperextension is bending of the knee in the opposite direction of
   flexion, for example, bending the leg backward past full extension by some amount. As
   described above, the prosthesis can provide varus/valgus constraint over a range that
   includes hyperextension, for example, 1 degree, 5 degrees, or more of hyperextension.
15         As shown in Fig. 3, post 302 has a wider width, W2 , at the inferior portion 305
   than at the superior portion 307. The increased anterior-posterior width strengthens the
   connection of the base 301 to the post 302. The width, W2, also enables the anterior
   surface 308 to engage the anterior cam 214.
           Fig. 4 shows a top view of the knee prosthesis 100 in extension. From this
20 position, as the knee flexes, the medial condylar surface 202 and the lateral condylar
   surface 204 roll and also glide over the medial bearing surface 316 and the lateral bearing
   surface 318, respectively. At flexion of approximately 60 to 90 degrees, the posterior
   cam 216 contacts the posterior surface 310 of the post 302 to provide posterior
   stabilization. Through continued flexion, the posterior cam 216 engages the posterior
25 surface 310 of the post 302.
           Thus, in some implementations, the posterior cam 216 is configured to engage the
   posterior surface 310 at a first angle that is between approximately 60 and 90 degrees of
   flexion, and at angles of flexion that are greater than the first angle. The posterior cam
   216 is configured to not engage the posterior surface 310 at angles of flexion less than the
30 first angle.
                                                   12

            Internal rotation of the tibia relative to the femur occurs as the knee flexes
   between full extension and approximately 130 degrees of flexion. Tibiofemoral rotation
   is achieved by asymmetrical translation of the lateral condylar portion 203 compared to
   the medial condylar portion 201 relative to the tibial insert 300. In general, the lateral
 5 condylar portion 203 translates over a greater range than the medial condylar portion 201,
   resulting in rotation of the femoral component 200 relative to the tibial insert 300.
             The asymmetric translation that drives tibiofemoral rotation is promoted by two
   mechanisms: first, the engagement of the bearing surfaces 316, 318 with the condylar
   surfaces 202, 204; and second, engagement of the asymmetrically-shaped posterior cam
10 216 with the posterior surface 310 of the post 302. These mechanisms result in the lateral
   condylar portion 203 of the femoral component sliding farther in a posterior direction
   than the medial condylar portion 201, relative to the tibial insert 300. Conversely, when
   moving toward extension, the lateral condylar portion 203 of the femoral component
   slides farther in an anterior direction than the medial condylar portion 201, relative to the
15 tibial insert 300. This anterior translation during extension brings the anterior surface
   308 of the post 302 near the anterior cam 214, where it may contact the post 302 if
   necessary to provide anterior stability. In some implementations, clearance is provided
    such that the anterior cam 214 does not contact the post 302 during normal standing, for
   example, with the leg straight at 0 degrees of flexion.
20           Differences between the medial bearing surface 316 and the lateral bearing
    surface 318 cause asymmetrical translation of the medial condylar surface 202 and the
    lateral condylar surface 204. For example, the medial bearing surface 316 is more
    concave (for example, extends deeper toward the inferior end of the tibial insert 300) than
   the lateral bearing surface 318. In other words, the lateral bearing surface 318 includes a
25  larger radius of curvature than the medial bearing surface 316, and the generally
    shallower slope of the lateral bearing surface 318 facilitates greater travel of the lateral
    condylar portion 203 than that of the medial condylar portion 201.
             The asymmetry of the posterior cam 216 also drives increased translation of the
    lateral condylar portion 203. At flexion between 0 degrees and approximately 60 to 90
30  degrees, before the posterior cam 216 engages the posterior surface 310 of the post 302,
                                                     13

   tibiofemoral rotation is promoted by the engagement of the condylar surfaces 202, 204
   and the bearing surfaces 316, 318. As noted above, the lateral portion 222 of the
   posterior cam 216 is thicker than the medial portion 220 of the posterior cam 216. Once
   the posterior cam 216 engages the posterior surface 310 (for example, at approximately
 5 60 to 90 degrees of flexion), the engagement of the thicker lateral portion 222 of the
   posterior cam 216 with the posterior surface 310 of the post 302 directs more force in the
   posterior direction on the lateral side of the femoral component 200, resulting in
   translation of the lateral condylar portion 203 that is greater than the translation of the
   medial condylar portion 201.
10          Referring to Fig. 5, with the knee shown at approximately 150 degrees of flexion,
   the lateral condylar portion 203 has translated more posteriorly than the medial condylar
   portion 201 resulting in tibiofemoral rotation. The difference in posterior translation is
   shown by distance D, which, for example, can correspond to rotation of the femoral
   component 200 relative to the tibial insert 300 of approximately 6 degrees or more. As
15 shown, the medial surface 304 and the lateral surface 306 no longer contact the walls
   210, 211, and thus do not provide varus/valgus constraint of the knee at this position.
            Referring to Figs. 6 and 7, the geometry of the tibial insert 300 permits and
   facilitates both tibiofemoral rotation and varus/valgus constraint. As noted above, the
   lateral surface 306 includes a contact section 320 (Fig. 6) and the medial surface 304
20 includes a contact section 322 (Fig. 7). These contact sections 320, 322 engage the walls
   210, 211 of the femoral component 200 to provide varus/valgus constraint. To provide
   varus/valgus constraint and still permit tibiofemoral rotation at angles of flexion, for
   example, between extension (or hyperextension) and approximately 90 to 120 degrees, a
   total clearance of approximately 0.005 to approximately 0.030 inches is provided
25 between the walls and the contact sections 320, 322. An increase in the clearance permits
   additional rotation, but lessens the varus/valgus constraint.
            The post 302 includes rounded edges 324 as transitions from the medial surface
    304 and lateral surface 306 to the anterior surface 308 and posterior surface 310 (also see
   Fig. 8). The rounded edges 324 extend substantially along a superior-inferior direction,
30  and are rounded substantially in a transverse plane. When the post 302 rotates within the
                                                   14

   clearance provided between the post 302 and the walls 210, 211, the rounded edges 324
   and portions of the anterior surface 308 and posterior surface 310 contact the walls 210,
   211. The radius of the rounded edge can be, for example, between approximately 0.030
   and 0.090 inches. A larger radius allows for more internal-external tibiofemoral rotation,
 5 but reduces the width, W, of the contact sections 320, 322 and the corresponding
   varus/valgus constraint. A smaller radius has the opposite effect.
           The dimensions of the contact sections 320, 322 also permit an effective balance
   of varus/valgus constraint and tibiofemoral rotation. The greater the width of the contact
   sections 320, 322 in an anterior-posterior dimension, the greater the varus/valgus
10 constraint but the less the tibiofemoral rotation. To achieve an appropriate balance, at
   various points along the axial length of the post 302, the width, W, of the contact sections
   320, 322 can be between approximately one sixth and two thirds of the width, W2, of the
   post 302. The width, W2 , can be the greatest width of the post 302 in an anterior
   posterior direction at a particular axial height. Thus in some implementations, the contact
15 sections 320, 322 extend such that, along at least half of the height, H, of the post 302,
   the width, W, of the contact sections 320, 322 at a given axial position is between one
   sixth and two thirds of a largest width (for example, W 2 ) of the post 302 at that axial
   position.
           In some implementations, the relationship between an anterior-posterior width at a
20 given axial position and the largest width at that axial position continues at portions of
   the medial surface 304 and the lateral surface 306 other than the contact sections 320,
   322. For example, the width of the medial surface 304 and the width of the lateral
   surface 306 in an anterior-posterior direction can be between approximately one sixth and
   two thirds of the largest width of the post 302 in an anterior-posterior direction at
25 positions along substantially the entire length of the medial surface 304 and the lateral
   surface 306 along the longitudinal axis, X, of the post 302.
           The contact sections 320, 322 are substantially rectangular, to provide generally
   even contact area with the walls 210, 211. The greater the axial length of the contact
   sections 320, 322, the greater the varus/valgus control provided. In some
30 implementations, the length of the contact sections 320, 322 along the axial direction of
                                                  15

   the contact sections 320, 322 is at least twice the width, W, of the contact sections 320,
   322. For example, the average length of the contact sections 320, 322 can be more than
   twice the average width or maximum width of the contact sections 320, 322. Similarly,
   the average length of the medial surface 304 can be more than twice the average width or
 5 maximum width of the medial surface 304, and the average length of the lateral surface
   306 can be more than twice the average width or maximum width of the lateral surface
   306.
            Differences between the lateral bearing surface 318 and the medial bearing
   surface 316 promote tibiofemoral rotation. The maximum depth or total depth, R1 (Fig.
10 6), of the concave portion of the lateral bearing surface 318 is less than the maximum
   depth or total depth, R2 (Fig. 7), of the concave portion of the medial bearing surface 316.
   In other words, the medial bearing surface 316 (Fig. 6) extends more inferior than the
   lateral bearing surface 318 (Fig. 7). Thus for an equal amount of force in a posterior
   direction, the resistance to translation is less on the side of the lateral bearing surface 316,
15 resulting in greater translation of the lateral condylar portion 203 than the translation of
   the medial condylar portion 201.
            In addition, the lateral bearing surface 318 includes a continuous concave portion
   330 that extends along the lateral bearing surface 318 in an anterior-posterior direction,
   generally centered in the tibial insert 300. On the other hand, a concave portion 332 of
20 the medial bearing surface 316, is offset from the center of the tibial insert in an anterior
   posterior direction, so that the concave portion 332 is located more toward the anterior of
   the tibial insert 300. The medial bearing surface 316 includes a plateau or raised portion
   at a posterior portion 325 of the medial bearing surface 316. Adjacent to the posterior
   portion 325, the medial bearing surface 316 includes sloped section 326 having a
25 relatively steep slope. For example, the medial concave portion 332 can have a slope at
   the sloped section 326 that is steeper than the slope of the lateral concave portion 330 at
   the same anterior-posterior position on the tibial insert 300. The sloped portion 326 can
   be steeper than the adjacent portions of the medial concave portion 332 and can be
    steepest portion of the medial concave portion 332 along the anterior-posterior direction.
30  The sloped section 326 can engage the medial condylar surface 202 to limit posterior
    travel of the medial condylar surface 202 during flexion.
                                                    16

            To further promote lateral travel of the lateral condylar portion 201, a bottom
   point or equilibrium point 327 (Fig. 6) (for example, indicating the most planar section of
   the lateral bearing surface 318) is located anterior to the center of the post 302 on the
   lateral bearing surface 318. An equilibrium point 328 (Fig. 7) of the medial bearing
 5 surface 316 is located generally at the same anterior position as the lateral equilibrium
   point 327. The condylar portions 201, 203 generally follow the slopes of the bearing
   surfaces 316, 318, which without other forces, would lead the condylar portions 201, 203
   to the respective equilibrium points 327, 328. This relationship between the anterior
   posterior position of the equilibrium points 327, 328 guides the femoral condylar portions
10 201, 203 to roughly the same anterior-posterior position when the knee is extended.
   Also, the position of the equilibrium points 327, 328 allows the lateral femoral condylar
   portion 203 to move more anterior than the medial condylar portion 201 as the knee
   extends, as occurs in a native knee due to the "screw home" mechanism.
            Referring to Fig. 9, in an alternate implementation of a tibial insert 400, the tibial
15 insert 400 includes a post 402 that is twisted along the longitudinal axis of the post 402.
   As a result, a medial surface 404 and a lateral surface 406 are offset from an anterior
   posterior alignment, and a superior portion of the post 402 is rotationally offset from an
   inferior portion of the post 402. Alternatively, the post 402 can be rotated instead of
   twisted. For example, a post can be rotationally offset from a base such that the medial
20 surface and the lateral surface are both oriented at an angle with respect to medial and
   lateral sides of the base from which the post extends. A twisted or rotated post can permit
   more internal tibial rotation in flexion than the non-rotated implementation without as
   much of a reduction in varus/valgus constraint.
            The medial surface 404 and the lateral surface 406 can include substantially flat
25 portions or other portions configured to contact the walls 210, 211 of the femoral
   component 200, described above, to provide varus/valgus constraint while allowing
   tibiofemoral rotation. For example, the medial surface 404 and lateral surface 406 are
    substantially parallel to each other. As another example, as the femoral component 200
   flexes with respect to the tibial insert 400, the walls 210, 211 follow the twist of the
30 medial surface 404 and the lateral surface 406 to provide tibiofemoral rotation. In
    extension, the medial posterior edge 408 and the lateral anterior edge 410 contact the
                                                   17

  walls 210, 211 to provide varus/valgus constraint. Other portions of the medial surface
  404 and the lateral surface 406 also engage the walls 210, 211 to provide varus/valgus
  constraint.
          A number of implementations and alternatives have been described.
5 Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without
  departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Accordingly, other implementations
  are within the scope of the following claims.
