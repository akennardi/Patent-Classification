    Sink Drain with Integrated Trap and Removable Lower Cover
   FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
           The present invention relates to sink drains and, in particular, it concerns a sink
   drain which integrates a gas trap, and optionally also a waste collection volume and a
 5 removable lower cover.
           Drainage installations for sinks typically include a number of distinct structures
   performing a number of distinct functions, as illustrated with reference to an under-sink
   assembly 100 shown in FIG. 12. A sink drain assembly 125 connects to the aperture of a
   sink (not shown), and typically includes a strainer including a grating or sieve for
 0 preventing passage of waste, which may include hair and objects above a given size.
   Particularly for kitchen sinks, the waste collection volume may be of relatively large
   diameter and depth, and typically has a removable "basket strainer" 170 in which waste
   collects until the strainer is intermittently removed and emptied. The sink drain
   assembly is typically connected to a pipe or "tailpiece" 120 by a connector, such as by a
 5 nut 140.
           A further requirement of under-sink plumbing installations is a "trap" 130, also
   referred to as a "gas trap" or "siphon", which traps a quantity of water by gravity so as
   to block escape of noxious sewer gases and odors up through the pipes to the sink. Traps
   can be implemented using S-bend or P-bend curved pipe sections, or as shown in FIG.
20 12, using a compact "bottle trap" assembly. The trap must be connected to tailpiece 120,
   such as at seal 150, and provides an outlet which must also be connected to a pipe (not
   shown) via a connector, such as nut 160, to connect the outlet of the trap to the
   wastewater drainage system. In many cases, one or more additional branch tube (not
   shown) is connected between the tailpiece and the trap in order to allow connection of a
25 sink overflow drain and/or an outlet of an appliance, such as a dishwasher. In many
   cases, the number of components and complexity of the arrangement is much greater
   than illustrated here.
           The above typical arrangement requires assembly of multiple components with a
   corresponding number of joints, each with potential for developing a leak. Furthermore,
                                            1

   the entire assembly occupies a considerable volume, and in particular, dictates a
   minimum vertical height of the assembly beneath the sink, thereby limiting usage of the
   under-sink space and rendering installation problematic in various space-limited
   scenarios.

    DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
           The present invention is a sink drain apparatus which integrates a gas trap, and
25  optionally also a waste collection volume and a removable lower cover.
           The principles and operation of an apparatus according to the present invention
    may be better understood with reference to the drawings and the accompanying
    description.
                                             9

            Referring now to the drawings in general terms, and using terminology which
    will be preserved throughout the description, FIGS. 1A-1 IC show a number of variant
    implementations of an apparatus, designated 10, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900
    and 1000, for connection to a drain aperture of a sink (the bottom surface of which is
  5 designated 12 in FIGS. 2A and 2B). To avoid repeated description of equivalent
    components in the various implementations, similar reference numerals will be used
    throughout the description for analogous elements, with the hundreds digit of the
    embodiment reference numeral used as a prefix to the numeral. Thus, the description of
    the components of apparatus 10 below should be understood to also describe the
  0 corresponding components of apparatus 200, 300 etc. where, for example, element 14
    will become 214, 314 etc., respectively, except where distinctions between the elements
    are explicitly specified or clearly required.
            In general terms, the apparatus includes an abutment surface 14 for abutting an
    underside 12 of the sink around the drain aperture, and a first wall portion 16, defining a
  5 drain receptacle enclosing an upper drain volume 18, also indicated by Vdrain. The first
    wall portion 16 includes an upper cylindrical portion, terminating at reference numeral
    49, and a lower conical or substantially frusto-conical portion. The receptacle has a top
    opening in alignment with the drain aperture of the sink, and a bottom opening. An
    annular wall portion 15 connects a wall portion including abutment surface 14 to first
 !0 wall portion 16 of the drain receptacle, and defines a seat for a sealing element, as
    shown in Figure 2A.
            A down-flow conduit 20, delineated at least in part by a second wall portion 22
    extends downwards from the first wall portion 16 of the drain receptacle around the
    bottom opening thereof, and defines a down-flow-path in fluid communication with
25  upper drain volume 18. A cross sectional area of the down-flow conduit is at least 80%,
    at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 100%, or at least 105% of the cross-sectional area of
    the bottom opening, along the entire length of the down-flow conduit.
            An up-flow conduit 24 is delineated at least in part by a third wall portion, or
    partition, 26, and defines an up-flow-path, which is parallel to the down-flow-path.
30  Second wall portion 22 (or in some cases third wall portion 26) has an edge defining a
                                             10

    lip 28 between down-flow conduit 20 and up-flow conduit 24. An outlet 30 extends
    from up-flow conduit 24, such that an outlet-flow-path thereof is in fluid communication
    with the up-flow-path.
            A removable lower cover 32 is configured for sealed connection with either or
  5 both of second wall portion 22 and third wall portion 26 so as to complete a flow path
    from down-flow conduit 20, via up-flow conduit 24 to outlet 30, such that a height
    differential  hd between lip 28 and outlet 30 defines a trap. In some embodiments, the
    height differential hd (hd  = outlet height position - lip height position) is at most 8cm, at
    most 7cm, at most 6cm, at most 5cm, or at most 4cm. In some embodiments, the height
  0 differential (hd) is at least 0.5cm, at least lcm, at least 1.5cm, at least 2cm, or at least
    3cm. In some embodiments, the height differential (hd) is within the range of 1 to 8cm, 2
    to 7cm, 3 to 7cm, 3.5 to 6cm, or 3 to 6cm.
            It is a particular feature of certain particularly preferred embodiments of the
    present invention that at least first wall portion 16, second wall portion 22, third wall
  5 portion 26 and outlet 30 are integrally formed as a unitary body, most preferably by an
    injection molding process. Abutment surface 14 is preferably also integrated with an
    upper part of the unitary body.
            It is another feature of the present invention that an upper portion of outlet 30 is
    disposed above the bottom opening of the drain receptacle defined by first wall portion
 !0 16, such that there is an overlap between a height of the drain receptacle (hr) and the top
    height position of the diameter of the outlet pipe, the overlap indicated by h in Figure
    ID. In some embodiments, h is at least 1.0cm, at least 1.5cm, at least 2.0cm, or at least
    2.5cm. In some embodiments, h is within the range of 1 to 7cm, 1 to 5cm, 1.5 to 7cm,
    1.5 to 6cm, 1.5 to 5cm, 1.5 to 4cm, 1.5 to 3.5cm, 2 to 6cm, 2 to 5cm, or 2.5 to 5cm.
25          In some embodiments, the upper portion of outlet 30 is disposed above the
    bottom edge 49 of the cylindrical portion of the drain receptacle by a height of h0 c. In
    some embodiments the height h0 c is greater than 0. In some embodiments, h0 c is at least
    0.5cm, at least 1.0cm, or at least 1.5cm. In some embodiments, h0 c is within the range of
    0.5 to 5cm, 0.5 to 4cm, 0.5 to 3cm, I to 5cm, I to 4cm, I to 3cm, 1.5 to 5cm, 1.5 to 4cm,
30  or 1.5 to 3cm.
                                              11

            By uniting the connection to the underside of the sink together with the trap
    structure and outlet as a single integral unit, completed by removable lower cover 32,
    and by creating an overlap of the outlet with the drain receptacle, the apparatus of the
    present invention typically achieves space-saving compactness, a reduced number of
  5 components and a reduced number of connections, thereby typically resulting in cost
    savings in production and installation, as well as improved reliability. These and other
    features, and advantages, of the present invention will become clearer from the detailed
    description of the various preferred embodiments.
            Specifically, the total height of apparatus 10, indicated by ht0,a in Figure ID, is at
  0 most 20 centimeters, at most 18 centimeters, or at most 15 centimeters. In some
    embodiments, the total height of the apparatus 10 is in the range of 12-20cm, 14-20cm,
    15-20cm, 12-18cm, 13-18cm, 14-18cm, 12-17cm, 13-17cm, 14-17cm, 15-17cm, 12
    16cm, 13-16cm, or 14-16cm. In most particularly preferred implementations of the
    present invention, the unitary body terminates at a lower opening 34 which is sealed by
  5 attachment of lower cover 32, which is preferably achieved by threaded interconnection.
    Thus, in the embodiments illustrated here, the unitary body has an external threaded
    region 36 while lower cover 32 has a complementary inner threaded region 38 within its
    rim. Other arrangements, such as with internal threading on the main body and external
    threading on lower cover 32, may also be used. Other forms of engagement, such as
 !0 bayonet connections and/or various arrangements of external clasps or the like, also fall
    within the scope of the present invention.
            In some embodiments, lower cover 32 has a depth, indicated by he in Figure ID,
    so as to increase the total height of the apparatus by 1 to 5cm, 1 to 4cm, 1.5 to 5cm, 1.5
    to 4cm, 1.5 to 3cm, 2 to 5cm, 2 to 4cm, 2 to 3.5cm, or 2 to 3cm.
25          The provision of an easily-removable         lower cover for the trap provides
    convenient access for unskilled persons for periodic cleaning of the trap and/or for
    recovery of any high-density object, such as jewelry, which may accidentally be
    dropped or flushed down a drain, without requiring particular skill or specialized tools.
            Another particularly preferred set of features of certain implementations of the
30  present invention relates to features defining a volume at and/or below the drain opening
                                              12

    of the sink for collecting waste from the sink. Such an arrangement is included in
    various drain configurations for kitchen sinks, often with a removable strainer 40,
    referred to as a "basket strainer", allowing periodic removal of the strainer to empty out
    the waste. To this end, first wall portion 16 may preferably be implemented as a
  5 cylindrical wall portion circumscribing upper drain volume 18, and having a cross
    sectional area greater than an internal cross-sectional area of each of down-flow conduit
    20 and up-flow conduit 24 adjacent to lip 28. Upper drain volume 18 thus provides
    sufficient volume for accommodating a removable basket strainer 40 for waste
    collection. A typical inner diameter of first wall portion 16 and of the drain receptacle,
  0 indicated by D in Figure ID, is at least 7cm, and typically within the range of 7-15cm,
    8-15cm, or 8-12cm. Similarly, the drain receptacle defined by first wall portion 16
    preferably circumscribes upper drain volume 18 so as to provide an unobstructed depth,
    or height hr of at least 2 centimeters, and more preferably, between about 4 and about 10
    centimeters, extending downwards from abutment surface 14 for receiving a removable
  5 basket strainer for waste collection.
            In some embodiments, the diameter De of lower cover 32 is substantially equal to
    the diameter D of the top opening of the drain receptacle, and a circumference of the
    lower cover 32 is substantially equal to the circumference of the top opening of the drain
    receptacle. In some such embodiments, the lower cover 32 is not concentric with the top
 !0 opening of the drain receptacle, such that the lower cover 32 is offset relative to the wall
    portion 16 and to the drain receptacle.
            In some embodiments, a length of the offset between the drain receptacle and the
    lower cover, indicated by Lomffet in Figure ID, is at least lcm, at least 2cm, at least 3cm,
    or at least 4cm.
25          In some embodiments, the offset length (Lomffet) is within a range of 1-10cm, 1
    8cm, 1-6cm, 2-10cm, 2-8cm, 2-6cm, 3-10cm, 3-8cm, 3-6cm, 4-10cm, 4-8cm, or 4-6cm.
            In the context of the present invention, the term "A is offset relative to B" is
    defined as the footprint of A not fully overlapping, or being fully coincident with, the
    footprint of B. Stated differently, there is a portion of the footprint of A that is not
                                             13

   included in the footprint of B, and there is a portion of the footprint of B that is not
   included in the footprint of A.
           It should be noted that first wall portion 16 circumscribes the drain volume 18,
   but does not typically come directly in contact with basket strainer 40, since the
 5 assembly of the apparatus to a sink typically includes an upper drain cup 42 (best seen in
   FIGS. 1A, 2A and 2B), inserted from above the base of the sink, which serves as an
   inner liner to first wall portion 16 when assembled.
           Various arrangements may be used within the scope of the present invention for
   clamping the apparatus to a sink. According to one particularly preferred but non
 0 limiting option, corresponding to the solution illustrated in most of the embodiments
   described herein, the apparatus includes a clamping block 44 with a threaded aperture 46
   supported at the base of upper drain volume 18 for bolted attachment to upper drain cup
   42. Clamping block 44 is typically supported by a number of spaced-apart fins 48 that
   leave openings for the passage of water from upper drain volume 18 to down-flow
 5 conduit 20. FIG. 2A illustrates an assembled configuration in which a bolt 50 tightens
   upper drain cup 42 towards clamping block 44, thereby closing an outer flange of upper
   drain cup 42 against an upper internal surface of sink 52 and drawing the apparatus
   upwards so that abutment surface 14 presses against the underside of sink 52 around the
   drain opening, preferably via a sealing washer or bead of sealant 54 disposed in seat 15.
 0         Optionally, one design of apparatus 10 may accommodate upper drain cups of
   different depths or sizes. By way of example, FIG. 2B illustrates an assembly similar to
   that of FIG. 2A employing a relatively shallower upper drain cup 42'. The shallower
   upper drain cup could be clamped directly to clamping block 44 simply by using a
   correspondingly longer bolt. As an alternative, FIG. 2B illustrates the use of a clamping
25 block adapter 56, shown in isometric view in FIG. 2C, which combines a male threaded
   portion 58 for engaging threaded aperture 46 and a threaded aperture 60 for bolted
   attachment to shallow upper drain cup 42' by use of a bolt 50.
           In certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, such as in apparatus
   10, 200, 300 and 700, down-flow conduit 20 and up-flow conduit 24 are in side-by-side
30 relation, with part of second wall portion 22, or third wall portion 26, defining a
                                            14

    partition between down-flow conduit 20 and up-flow conduit 24. The definition of the
    partition as part of second wall portion 22 or third wall portion 26 may be somewhat
    arbitrary, as the partition is essentially a shared wall subdividing between the two
    conduits, and is integrally formed with the other wall portions. In the case of apparatus
  5 10 and 200, the partition is curved, with its concave side facing towards outlet 30,
    thereby leaving a majority of a generally cylindrical lower section of the apparatus to
    define a volume contiguous with down-flow conduit 20. This arrangement is particularly
    useful for accommodating additional inlets into the trap, such as single supplementary
    inlet 62 of apparatus 10, or the two supplementary inlets 262a and 262b of apparatus
  0 200. These supplementary inlets may be used for drain connections for various kitchen
    appliances, such as a dishwasher, for sink overflow connections and/or may allow for
    connection    of one    or more     additional   sink   drains  (with conventional     drain
    configurations) to the trap of the apparatus of the invention, for example, in a double
    sink installation. In some cases, for double sink installations, it may be preferable to
  5 install two apparatuses according to the present invention, one for each sink, and then
    simply connect the outlets via a T-connector or the like to a common wastewater drain
    system. It will be noted that there may be any desired number of supplementary inlets,
    and that each inlet may be implemented in any desired configuration in order to
    accommodate specific design needs. Thus, in one further non-limiting example, an
 !0 apparatus (not shown) similar to apparatus 200 maybe implemented with a dedicated
    overflow inlet, typically connecting directly to upper drain volume 18, a dedicated hose
    connector (for example, with a ribbed, conically tapered tip for pressure-fitting of a
    hose) for a dishwasher or the like, and one or two additional inlets for adjacent sinks or
    the like. Any inlets that are not required for a given installation may be sealed with a
25  suitable stopper.
            In each case where one or more supplementary inlet is provided, the inlet is
    preferably located above lip 28 by a differential height sufficient to maintain the gas trap
    functionality, and most preferably, maintains a height differential of at least     hd (FIG.
    ID) corresponding to the height differential between outlet 30 and lip 28 . It should be
30  noted that the term "height differential" in this context is used to define the height of the
                                            15

    head of water caught in the trap, from lip 28 up to the lowest part of the opening of
    outlet 30 (and similarly with regard to supplementary inlet 62).
            Turning now to FIG. 3, this depicts apparatus 200, which is essentially similar to
    apparatus 10 described above, with equivalent features designated by similar numerals
  5 with addition of 200. Only the unitary body is shown here. Apparatus 200 is fully
    analogous to apparatus 10, differing only in the provision of two supplementary inlets
    262a and 262b. In all other respects, the structure and function of apparatus 200 will be
    fully understood from the generic description above.
            Turning now to FIGS. 4A-4D, these depict apparatus 300, which is essentially
  0 similar to apparatus 10 described above, with equivalent features designated by similar
    numerals with addition of 300. Apparatus 300 is fully analogous to apparatus 10, but is
    implemented without any supplementary inlet, allowing a particularly compact lower
    structure. The part of second wall portion 322 providing the partition between down
    flow conduit 320 and up-flow conduit 324 is here implemented as a roughly straight
  5 wall. In all other respects, the structure and function of apparatus 300 will be fully
    understood from the generic description above.
            Turning now to FIGS. 5A and 5B, these depict apparatus 400, which is
    essentially similar to apparatus 10 described above, with equivalent features designated
    by similar numerals with addition of 400. Apparatus 400 differs from apparatus 10 in
 !0 that it employs an arrangement in which down-flow conduit 420 is implemented as an
    internal pipe defined by an inner second wall portion 422 forming a roughly-cylindrical
    conduit circumscribed by up-flow conduit 424 defined by an outer wall 426. The
    resulting structure is roughly concentric, maintaining a roughly cylindrical symmetry
    below the sink drain opening, which may in some cases be advantageous. In all other
25  respects, the structure and function of apparatus 400 will be fully understood from the
    generic description above.
            FIGS. 6-8 illustrate apparatuses 500, 600 and 700, respectively, which are
    essentially similar to earlier     described  implementations,   differing only in the
    geometrical shapes and proportions. Specifically, apparatus 500 is closely similar to
30  apparatus 400 but exemplifies an implementation in which upper drain volume 518 is
                                            16

    relatively narrow and deep, with a depth at least equal to its diameter. Apparatus 600 has
    an even narrower upper drain volume 618 such that first wall portion 616 and second
    wall portion 622 are essentially successive sections of a cylindrical tube. These narrower
    implementations may be particularly suited to sinks with narrow drain openings, such as
  5 for example in bathroom sinks. Apparatus 700 is functionally interchangeable with
    apparatus 600 in that it provides a narrow upper drain volume 718, but it employs a
    side-by-side arrangement of down-flow conduit 720 and up-flow conduit 724, more
    similar to apparatus 400 above.
            Turning now to FIG. 9, this depicts apparatus 800, which is similar to apparatus
  0 10 described above, with equivalent features designated by similar numerals with
    addition of 800. Only the unitary body is shown here, to be complemented by a lower
    removable cover, upper drain cup etc., as in the other embodiments. In the previously
    illustrated "concentric" structures, such as apparatus 400, the down-flow conduit was
    internal to the up-flow conduit. Apparatus 800 illustrates an alternative implementation
  5 in which up-flow conduit 824 is implemented as an internal conduit circumscribed by
    down-flow conduit 820. In all other respects, the structure and function of apparatus 800
    will be fully understood from the generic description above.
            Turning now to FIGS. 10A-10B, this depicts apparatus 900, which is similar to
    apparatus 10 described above, with equivalent features designated by similar numerals
 !0 with addition of 900. Only the unitary body is shown here, to be complemented by a
    lower removable cover, upper drain cup etc., as in the other embodiments. While the
    various implementations illustrated thus far have provided a sizeable upper drain
    volume suitable for receiving a basket strainer or the like, it should be noted that
    implementations of the invention with a minimal upper drain volume sufficient only for
25  receiving a standard drain cover, without a distinct waste receiving volume, also fall
    within the scope of an aspect of the present invention. This is exemplified by apparatus
    900, in which a shallow upper drain volume 918 is defined between abutment surface
    914 and clamping block 944. The integration of the abutment surface with the wall
    portions forming down-flow conduit 920, up-flow conduit 924 and outlet 930 still
30  provides profound advantages of compactness, ease of assembly, reduced number of
                                            17

    parts etc., while the provision of a removable lower cover (not shown) provides
    convenient access for unskilled persons for periodic cleaning of the trap and/or for
    recovery of any high-density object, as discussed above.
           Turning finally to FIGS. 11 A-1 IC, this depicts apparatus 1000, which is similar
  5 to apparatus 10 described above, with equivalent features designated by similar
    numerals with addition of 1000. All of the implementations illustrated above have been
    configured for attachment to a sink drain aperture by use of a central bolt which clamps
    together the unitary body and an upper drain cup. It should be noted however that the
    present invention is not limited to this form of attachment, and may also be implemented
  0 using various other forms of attachment to a sink. By way of one further non-limiting
    example, FIG. 11 A illustrates an alternative form of drain cup 1042 which has external
    threading 1064 around an outer diameter of the drain cup, extending downwards from an
    upper radial flange 1066. In conventional applications, such a cup is inserted from above
    through a sink drain aperture, and a threaded clamping ring/nut is screwed onto
  5 threading 1064 from below the sink, tightening and clamping the drain cup to the
    aperture. In conventional applications, a tailpiece is then connected to a smaller-gauge
    lower opening 1068 of the drain cup.
           According to the teachings of an aspect of the present invention illustrated in
    FIGS. 11 B and 1IC, the part of an outer wall portion 1026 adjacent to abutment surface
 !0 1014 is formed with internal threading 1070 for engaging threading 1064 so that wall
    portion 1026 can be directly screwed onto drain cup 1042 to achieve clamping of the
    apparatus to sink 1052, as shown in FIG. 1 IC.
           Wall portion 1026 extends downwards to a rim 1034, which defines a lower
    opening that sealingly receives removable lower cover 1032. The apparatus is provided
25  with an outlet 1030. In this case, as in the above implementations, abutment surface
    1014, a wall portion 1026, rim 1034 and outlet 1030 are integrally formed as a unitary
    body. Furthermore, and also as in apparatus 400 above, when assembled, wall portion
    1026 and removable lower cover 1032 form at least part of an outer casing of a bottle
    trap preventing passage of gases from outlet 1030 to the drain aperture.
                                             18

           In contrast to the above embodiments, the wall portion 1022 defining an inner
   down-flow conduit 1020 is here implemented as a separate component with its own
   threaded neck portion 1072 for threaded connection to lower opening 1068 of drain cup
    1042. This adds one additional component to the system, but still maintains the overall
 5 compactness and simplicity of the device. In some cases, a dedicated drain cup design
    1042 may be integrally formed with a tailpiece 1022, thereby reducing the total number
   of components in the assembly.
           The various embodiments described herein may be implemented using a wide
   range of materials. Most typically, the unitary body and the lower cover are formed from
 0 injection-molded plastic materials, while the upper drain cup if formed from metal, for
   example, aluminum or stainless steel. However, the invention is not limited to such
   implementations, and alternative implementations made wholly from plastic materials,
   wholly from metal, or from any other material, also fall within the scope of the
   invention.
 5         To the extent that the appended claims have been drafted without multiple
   dependencies, this has been done only to accommodate formal requirements in
   jurisdictions which do not allow such multiple dependencies. It should be noted that all
   possible combinations of features which would be implied by rendering the claims
   multiply dependent are explicitly envisaged and should be considered part of the
!0 invention.
           It will be appreciated that the above descriptions are intended only to serve as
   examples, and that many other embodiments are possible within the scope of the present
   invention as defined in the appended claims.
