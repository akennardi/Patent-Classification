                                                 1
     Use of anti-CD19 maytansinoid immunoconjugate antibody for the treatment of
                                B-cell malignancies symptoms
   The present invention relates to the use of anti-CD19 maytansinoid immunoconjugate
   for the treatment of B-cell malignancies symptom.
   Cell surface molecules expressed by B cells and their malignant counterparts represent
   important targets for immunotherapy.
   CD19 is the earliest differentiation antigen of the B lymphocyte lineage, expressed on
   most B cells, but not detected on plasma cells, stem cells, or on normal myeloid
 5 lineage.
   Therefore, CD19 is expressed on tumor cells from all B cell derived neoplasms (Bcell
   non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic
   leukemia) except myeloma.
   B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) is the fifth most common malignancy in the
10 United States and continues to increase in incidence, especially in elderly patients.
   While patients with hematological malignancies have benefited over the past decade
   from therapeutic optimization using conventional drug therapy, a majority of patients
   still succumb to their disease and drug therapies remain highly toxic. Hence, future
   efforts towards developing new therapies to improve survival and quality of life of
15 lymphoma patients must include strategies that specifically targets cancer cells and
   show improved safety and efficacy.
            HuB4-DM4 is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of a humanized IgG1
   monoclonal antibody, huB4, which specifically targets the CD19 antigen, conjugated
   through a disulfide link to the maytansinoid derivative DM4, a potent tubulin inhibitor.
20 The structure of the HuB4-DM4 conjugate SAR3419 is disclosed on figure 1 and the
   sequence of the heavy and light chains of the antibody are listed in the enclosed
   sequence listing, said light chain having the sequence represented in SEQ ID NO. 7,
   and said heavy chain having the sequence represented in SEQ ID NO. 8.
   After binding to the CD19 antigen, the HuB4-DM4 conjugate undergoes internalization
25 and intracellular release of DM4.
   In the first-in-man study TED6828 the HuB4-DM4 conjugate SAR3419 administered IV
   once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (N=39) in patients with refractory/relapsed CD19+
   NHL, 7 dose levels (10 mg/m 2 to 270 mg/m 2 ) was tested. The Maximum Tolerated Dose
                          2
   (MTD) was 160 mg/m       every 3 weeks. The dose limiting toxicity was reversible corneal

                                                 2
   toxicity. The most frequent drug related toxicity was ocular (all grades) observed in
   43.5% of patients, 15.4% being of grade 3/4. The toxicities consisting mainly of blurred
   vision associated with microcystic deposits on the corneal epithelium (corneal toxicities)
   were reversible in all cases.
 5 The preliminary results of this trial have been published in the abstracts of the ASH
   2009 (Younes et al, ASH ANNUAL Meeting Abstracts, 2009, 114(22):585).
   It has now been found that it is possible to reduce the toxicity, and in particular the
   ocular toxicity, resulting from the treatment with the HuB4-DM4 conjugate by
   administering the HuB4-DM4 conjugate with another dosage regimen.
10 It has furthermore been shown that the conjugate SAR3419 allows treating patients
   having B-cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in particular Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma
   (DLBCL).
   The invention relates to methods, compositions and articles as disclosed herein.

                                                  8
   According to this document the eye disorders are classified by adverse events (AE) that
   are graded depending on their severity.
   The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for
   each AE based on this general guideline:
 5 Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only;
   intervention not indicated.
   Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated; limiting age
   appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL).
   Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening;
10 hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care
   ADL.
   Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
   Grade 5 Death related to AE.
   The anti-CD19 maytansinoid immunoconjugate can be administered within a
15 pharmaceutical compositions comprising:
          *   an effective amount of anti-CD19 maytansinoid immunoconjugate, and
          *   a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may be inert or physiologically
              active.
   As used herein, "pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers" includes any and all solvents,
20 dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, and the like that are
   physiologically compatible. Examples of suitable carriers, diluents and/or excipients
   include one or more of water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, dextrose, glycerol,
   ethanol, and the like, as well as combination thereof. In many cases, it will be
   preferable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, polyalcohols, or sodium chloride
25 in the composition. In particular, relevant examples of suitable carrier include: (1)
   Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline, pH     -   7.4, containing or not containing about
   1 mg/ml to 25 mg/ml human serum albumin, (2) 0.9% saline (0.9% w/v sodium chloride
   (NaCI)), and (3) 5% (w/v) dextrose; and may also contain an antioxidant such as
   tryptamine and a stabilizing agent such as Tween 20.
30 In another embodiment, the anti-CD19 maytansinoid immunoconjugate is administered
   intravenously. However other mode of parenteral administration can be used: e.g.
   intramuscular, intraperinoneal or subcutaneous.

                                                  9
   When the anti-CD19 maytansinoid immunoconjugate is administered intravenously it
   can be administered as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time that is
   typically comprised between 10 minutes and 4 hours.
   In another embodiment, they are injected by intramuscular, subcutaneous, intra
 5 articular, intrasynovial, intratumoral, peritumoral, intralesional, or perilesional routes, to
   exert local as well as systemic therapeutic effects. They can be also administered by
   nebulisation.
   The anti-CD19 maytansinoid immunoconjugate may be administered in a variety of
   forms. These include for example liquid, semi-solid, and solid dosage forms, but the
10 form depends on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application.
   Typical compositions are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions.
   Sterile compositions for parenteral administration can be prepared by incorporating the
   anti-CD19 maytansinoid immunoconjugate in the required amount in the appropriate
   solvent, followed by sterilization by microfiltration. As solvent or vehicle, there may be
15 used water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like,
   as well as a combination thereof. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic
   agents, such as sugars, polyalcohols, or sodium chloride in the composition. These
   compositions may also contain adjuvants, in particular wetting, isotonizing, emulsifying,
   dispersing and stabilizing agents. Sterile compositions for parenteral administration
20 may also be prepared in the form of sterile solid compositions which may be dissolved
   at the time of use in sterile water or any other injectable sterile medium.
   The anti-CD19 maytansinoid immunoconjugate may be administered with a further
   therapeutic agent, such a chemotherapeutic agent, as necessary for the particular
   disorder being treated. Preferably, the anti-CD19 maytansinoid immunoconjugate and
25 the supplementary active agent will have complementary activities that do not
   adversely affect each other.
            Such a chemotherapeutic agent may be administered simultaneously, semi
   simultaneously, separately, or spaced out over a period of time so as to obtain the
   maximum efficacy of the co-administration; it being possible for each administration to
30 vary in its duration from a rapid administration to a continuous perfusion.
   The man skilled in the art may refer in particular to EP1 651162 to carry out the present
   invention.

   TED6829)
   STUDY OBJECTIVES
10 Primary:
   . To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR3419 according to the Dose
   Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) observed when administered IV, as a single agent, once
   weekly in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL.
   Secondary:
15 . To characterize the global safety profile of SAR3419
   . To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR3419
   . To perform pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments
   . To assess the potential immunogenicity of SAR3419
   . To assess preliminary evidence of anti-lymphoma activity
20 METHODS
   Study design
   . Adult patients with refractory or relapsed B-cell NHL expressing the CD19 antigen
   were enrolled.
   . Dose escalation was based on safety in a 3+3 design.
25 . The dose-escalation was guided by the occurrence of pre-defined DLT during the
   initial 3 week period of treatment. Late or cumulative toxicities during the treatment
   period could also be considered for defining the recommended dose.
   . SAR3419 Drug Product was available as a solution for infusion at 25 mg / 25 mL
   (1 mg/mL) with reference to the active entity supplied in a 30 mL clear glass vial.
30 . SAR3419 as single agent was administered IV once weekly for 8 doses. Any further
   treatment that may be of clinical benefit for the patient could be discussed and agreed
   between the investigators and the sponsor.

                                                 11
   . Premedication with diphenhydramine 50mg IV and acetaminophen 650 mg per os was
   required prior to each infusion.
   Evaluations
   . Computed Tomography (CT) and / or Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan
 5 performed at study entry, after 8 doses and 42-49 days after the last treatment (EOT).
   Responders were followed every 3 months for up to 1 year.
   . PK and immunogenicity assessments were performed using blood samples collected
   at baseline, at specific time-points during the treatment and at EOT.

 5   CONCLUSIONS
       Using weekly schedule of SAR3419 for 8 -12 doses, the maximum tolerated dose is 55
     mg/m 2/week.
     . SAR3419 demonstrates encouraging activity in both indolent and aggressive NHL with
     an ORR of 33% at the MTD.
10   . Tumor shrinkage was observed in 25 (58%) patients.
     . Globally SAR3419 is well tolerated with a median number of doses per patient of 8
     overall, and a median relative dose intensity of 0.96 at the MTD. Noteworthy is the lack
     of significant myelosuppression, making SAR3419 an appealing ADC to be combined
     with conventional chemotherapy.. .In the weekly schedule, the ocular toxicity (all

                                               16
   grades) is 22% (2% grade 3/4) whereas in the 3 weeks administration regimen the
   ocular toxicity (all grades) was 43.5% with 15.4% of grade 3/4.
   . Paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies allowed to show DM4 accumulation in tumors
   decrease in CD19 protein expression level and mitosis blockade confirming the
 5 mechanism of action of the drug.
    . Based on the clinical evidence of two grade 3 toxicities (optic neuropathy and
   paresthesia) with late onset supported by PK data showing drug accumulation after
   weekly dosing, the protocol was amended to evaluate an optimized schedule consisting
   of 4 weekly doses of 55 mg/m 2 followed by 4 additional doses administered once every
10 2 weeks.
   EXAMPLE 2: HuB4-DM4 conjugate administered weekly and then bi-weekly
   (qw/q2w schedule) in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory CD19-positive B-cell
   Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (amended clinical trial of study TED6829)
   Based on the clinical evidence of two late toxicities with late onset supported by PK
15 data showing that steady state is reached after 3-4 weeks of treatment, the protocol
   described in EXAMPLE 1 was amended to evaluate an optimized schedule consisting
   of 4 weekly doses of 55 mg/m 2 followed by 4 additional doses administered once every
   2 weeks (ongoing).
   The STUDY OBJECTIVES and METHODS are identical to EXAMPLE 1, except that
20 SAR3419 as single agent was administered IV under a schedule consisting of 4 weekly
   doses followed by 4 bi-weekly doses at the RD.
   Furthermore the SAR3419 Drug Product was available as a concentrate solution for
   infusion at 125 mg / 25 mL, i.e.5 mg/ml with reference to the active entity supplied in a
   30 mL clear glass vial.
25 The study of EXAMPLE 1 was extended to treat 25 patients with the optimized
   schedule.

    CONCLUSIONS
 5  Median number of doses received was 8 as planned with a median relative dose
    intensity of 1.0 [0.8-1.0] at the RD.
    The most frequent related TEAEs were asthenia in 5 (23.8%) patients (1 event being of
    grade 3) and gastrointestinal disorders in 7 (33%) patients. Reversible grade 1 blurred
    vision / corneal event occurred in 1 patient. Grade 3-4 haematological toxicities were
10  minimal.
    Tumor shrinkage was observed in 16 (64%) patients. Seven (28%) patients, achieved
    an objective response including 1 CR and 3 Complete Response (CRu). The response
    rate was essentially preserved in aggressive disease (3/9 DLBCL patients).
    In conclusion the schedule consisting of 4 weekly doses followed by 4 bi-weekly doses
15  shows an improved safety profile compared to prior tested schedules, with a clinical
    efficacy preserved essentially in aggressive lymphoma.

    OVERALL CONCLUSIONS
    SAR3419 MTD/RD was determined during this study as 55 mg/m 2 (maximum tolerated
    dose) whilst the maximum administered dose (MAD) was 70 mg/m 2.
    The optimized administration schedule (55 mg/m 2 weekly/biweekly) showed an
 5  improved safety profile compared to prior tested schedules with apparent clinical
    control of the incidence and severity of ADC (corneal) / DM4 (neuro-, digestive and
    hematological) related-toxicities.
    Anti lymphoma activity was observed in both schedules of administration, around 30%
    of patients at the 55 mg/m 2 MTD/RD, especially in patients with aggressive histology
10  (DLBCL) at that dose in the weekly/biweekly recommended schedule of administration.
