MULTI-ENCAPSULATED FORMULATIONS MADE WITH OXIDIZED CELLULOSE
BACKGROUND
         Technical Field
[0001] The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for dissolving cellulose. In

[000 la]          The present application is a divisional of AU 2013314997, the entire
specification of which is incorporated herein by cross-reference.
        Backgound of Related Art
100021     Cellulose is the most abundant biorenewable material, and celiulese-derived products
have been used in multiple industries, including manufacturing of textiles and medical devices.
Apart from the use of unmodified cellulose-containing materials (for example wood, cotton),
modern cellulose technology requires extraction and processing of cellulose from primary
sources using techniques that have changed very little since the inception of the modem chemical
industry.
100031     The full potential of cellulose and cellulose products has not been fully exploited,
partially due to the historical shift towards petroleum-based polymers, and also by the limited
number of common solvents in which cellulose is readily soluble. Traditional cellulose
dissolution processes, including the cuprammonium and xanthate processes, are often
cumbersome or expensive and require the use of unusual solvents, typically with a high ionic
strength, under relatively harsh conditions.
100041     Various processes for dissolving cellulose have been previously disclosed. See, for
example, McCormick, et al "Solution Studies of Cellulose in Lithium Chloride and NN
Dimethylacetamide," Macromolecules, 1985, Vol, 18, No. 12, 1985, pp. 2394 - 2401; Timpa,
"Application of Universal Calibration in Gel Permeation Chromatography for Molecular Weight

Determination of Plant Cell Wall Polymers: Cotton Fiber," J. Agric. Food Chem., 1991, 39, 270
- 275; and Strli6 et al., "Size Exclusion Chromatograhy of Cellulose in LiCl/N,N
Dimethylacetamide," J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods, 2003, 56, pp. 265 - 279.
[0005]    Improved processes for dissolving cellulose, that overcome the need for high thermal
treatment, excessive physical manipulation (e.g., stirring), and/or lengthy treatment periods, all
of which contribute to the degradation of the cellulose and removal of oxidized groups from
oxidized cellulose, remain desirable.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS
[00338] The present disclosure provides a system and method for dissolving cellulose. In
embodiments, the present disclosure provides a process using a polar aprotic solvent and a salt,
which is added in a step-wise manner to dissolve oxidized or non-modified cellulose. The
dissolution process according to the present disclosure minimizes degradation of the oxidized
cellulose, by conducting the process in an inert and dry atmosphere, introducing the salt in a
                                                 46

specific sequence, heating the solution at a predetermined temperature and time, and minimizing
shearing forces on the solution.
[00339] As described herein, cellulose includes natural (e.g., non-modified) or modified (e.g.,
treated) celluloses including, but not limited to, oxidized cellulose, alkyl celluloses, hydroxyalkyl
celluloses, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, nitrocelluloses, combinations thereof, and the like.
Additional examples of suitable modified cellulose derivatives include, but are not limited to,
methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose,
hydroxybutyl methyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate,
cellulose acetate phthalate, carboxymethyl cellulose, cellulose triacetate, and cellulose sulfate
sodium salt.
[00340] As used herein, oxidized cellulose denotes cellulose having at least a portion of
hydroxyl groups replaced by carboxyl, aldehyde, and/or ketone groups by oxidation. Oxidized
cellulose may be formed using any technique within the purview of those skilled in the art. For
example, cellulose may be oxidized by exposing it to an oxidation medium, such as a densified
or supercritical fluid including, but not limited to, nitrogen dioxide, carbon dioxide,
combinations thereof, and the like. In embodiments, the oxidation medium may include a
combination of densified or supercritical fluids, such as nitrogen dioxide dissolved in carbon
dioxide. The cellulose material may be exposed to the oxidizing medium for a period of time of
from about 20 minutes to about 24 hours, in embodiments from about 1 hour to about 5 hours, at
a temperature from about 200 C to about 60' C, in embodiments from about 30' C to about 450
C, and at a pressure of from about 20 bars to about 250 bars, in embodiments from about 30 bars
to about 90 bars. Methods for oxidizing cellulose materials using densified fluids are disclosed,
for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0194805, the entire disclosure
                                                    47

which is incorporated by reference herein. Other methods for preparing oxidized cellulose
materials are also disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,364,200; 4,626,253; 5,484,913;
and 6,500,777, the entire disclosures, of each of which are incorporated by reference herein.
[00341] Turning now to Fig. 1, a system for dissolving cellulose, including oxidized cellulose,
in accordance with the present disclosure is provided. System 10 includes a reactor vessel 12,
which may be a three-neck round-bottom flask. The reactor vessel 12 includes a gas inlet 14 and
a gas outlet 16, both of which are coupled to a source of inert gas (not shown). The reactor
vessel 12 may also include any number of inlets, spigots, and other connectors to provide for
convenient addition of reactants and/or removal of products to or from the vessel 12,
respectively. Dissolution of the oxidized cellulose may be carried out either as a continuous
process or a batch process.
[00342]   The dissolution process is performed in an inert, i.e., oxygen free, and dry atmosphere.
In embodiments, the reactor vessel 12 may be purged with an inert gas prior to commencing the
dissolution process by circulating an inert gas through the reactor vessel 12 via the inlet 14 and
outlet 16. The gas may also be circulated through the reactor vessel 12 during the dissolution
process. Suitable inert gases include, but are not limited to, nitrogen and noble gases such as
helium, neon, argon, and combinations thereof.
[00343]   Initially, a solvent is added to the reactor vessel 12 through any suitable inlet. In
embodiments, the solvent for dissolving oxidized cellulose may be any polar aprotic organic
solvent having a boiling point from about 1750 C to about 205' C, in embodiments from about
1800 C to about 2020 C. Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, N,N
Dimethylacetamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), and combinations thereof.
                                                   48

[00344] The solvent may also be sparged (e.g., gas bubbled therethrough) by the inert gas to
exclude moisture and dissolved oxygen therefrom. Cellulose is then added to the solvent and
may be agitated by a mixer 18 to swell the cellulose. Mixing is performed at a relatively low rate
to prevent degradation of the cellulose. The stirring may be from about 100 revolutions per
minute (rpm) to about 500 rpm, in embodiments from about 150 rpm to about 250 rpm. As
described above, the reactor vessel 12 may be a round-bottomed container, which further
minimizes the shearing forces imparted on the cellulose by the mixer 18.
[00345]    The mixture of the solvent and oxidized cellulose may be heated to a temperature from
about 1150 C to about 1450 C, in embodiments from about 1200 C to about 1400 C in further
embodiments from about 1300 C to about 1350 C. In embodiments, the degree of oxidation of
oxidized cellulose dissolved using the processes in accordance with the present disclosure may
be from about 0.2 to about 1.0, in embodiments from about 0.3 to about 0.9, in further
embodiments from about 0.5 to about 0.7. As used herein, the term "degree of oxidation" refers
to a ratio of carboxyl groups to hydroxyl groups of the cellulose. The "degree of oxidation" is
also used as an average degree of oxidation of the entire cellulose sample. Without being bound
by any particular theory, it is believed that the temperature of the mixture of the solvent and
oxidized cellulose depends on the degree of oxidation of the oxidized cellulose. As the degree of
oxidation increases, the temperature required to swell oxidized cellulose decreases. Conversely,
as the degree of oxidation decreases, the temperature required to swell oxidized cellulose
increases. Heating of the cellulose during the dissolution process is minimized. Heating of the
cellulose may lead to degradation thereof, including destruction of reactive groups of oxidized
cellulose and decrease in molecular weight.
                                                   49

[00346] The mixture of the solvent and oxidized cellulose having a degree of oxidation of about
0.5 or above may be heated to a temperature from about 1150 C to about 1350 C, in embodiments
from about 1250 C to about 1300 C. The mixture of the solvent and oxidized cellulose having a
degree of oxidation of from about 0.25 to about 0.5 may be heated to a temperature from about
1300 C to about 1450 C, in embodiments from about 1350 C to about 1400 C.
[00347] The solvent initially swells the cellulose due to its relatively high polarity. Swelling of
oxidized cellulose may continue from about 1 hour to about 4 hours, in embodiments from about
1.5 hours to about 2.5 hours. After the oxidized cellulose has swelled, the temperature of the
mixture is reduced. In embodiments, the mixture of oxidized cellulose may be cooled prior to
addition of the salt to a temperature from about 900 C to about 1200 C, in embodiments from
about 1000 C to about 1100 C.
[00348] Without being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that introduction of the salt
into the mixture provides intercalation of the salt into the cellulose. The swelling of the cellulose
with the solvent enhances the introduction of the salt into the cellulose, which in turn, affects
final dissolution of the cellulose. In embodiments, the salt may be any alkali halide salt.
Suitable salts include, but are not limited to, lithium halides, such as lithium fluoride, lithium
chloride, lithium bromide, and lithium iodide; sodium halides, such as sodium fluoride, sodium
chloride, sodium bromide, and sodium iodide; potassium halides, such as potassium fluoride,
potassium chloride, potassium bromide, and potassium iodide; and any combinations of the
foregoing. The salt may be present in an amount of from about 0.1% by weight to 3% by weight
of the oxidized cellulose, in embodiments from about 0.25% by weight to about 2% by weight of
the oxidized cellulose. Conventional dissolution processes rely on higher salt concentration to
dissolve non-modified cellulose, which are unsuitable for dissolving oxidized cellulose. Lower
                                                    50

concentration of salt prevents or lessens degradation of oxidized cellulose including destruction
of reactive groups of oxidized cellulose and decrease in molecular weight as described above.
As used herein, designation of "by weight" may be used interchangeably with "by volume" and
denotes "by weight/volume."
[00349] Conducting the dissolution process in a step-wise manner, namely, initial swelling of
the cellulose in the solvent prior to introduction of the salt, allows for dissolution of the cellulose
at lower temperatures than conventional processes, which usually require temperatures above
150' C. The step-wise dissolution process at lower temperatures also prevents or lessens
degradation of oxidized cellulose including destruction of reactive groups of oxidized cellulose
and decrease in molecular weight as described above. In embodiments, the degree of oxidation
of the dissolved oxidized cellulose may be from about 80% to about 120% of the degree of
oxidation of the pre-processed, i.e., undissolved, oxidized cellulose, in embodiments from about
90% to about 110%. In embodiments, the molecular weight of the dissolved oxidized cellulose
may be from about 80% to about 100% of the molecular weight of the pre-processed, i.e.,
undissolved, oxidized cellulose, in embodiments from about 90% to about 95%. As used herein,
the term "molecular weight" refers to weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the cellulose.
This term "molecular weight" is also used as an average molecular mass of the entire cellulose
sample. Undissolved (e.g., prior to dissolution) oxidized cellulose may have a molecular weight
from about 50,000 Daltons to about 500,000 Daltons, in embodiments from about 100,000
Daltons to about 400,000 Daltons.
[00350]    If the oxidized cellulose is not fully dissolved, the process may continue with stirring
and heating at a lower temperature from about 40' C to about 80' C, in embodiments from about
500 C to about 600 C, for a period of time from about 1 hour to about 5 hours, in embodiments
                                                   51

from about 2 hours to about 3 hours, until the oxidized cellulose is dissolved. The resulting
solution of oxidized cellulose includes oxidized cellulose present at a concentration of from
about 5 milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL) to about 25 mg/mL, in embodiments from about 10
mg/mL to about 20 mg/mL.
[00351]    The system of Fig. 1 may also be used to dissolve non-modified cellulose. The process
for dissolving non-modified cellulose may utilize the same solvents as described above for
dissolving oxidized cellulose. Initially, the non-modified cellulose is swelled in the solvent. The
mixture of the solvent and non-modified cellulose may be heated to a temperature from about
1350 C to about 1650 C, in embodiments from about 145' C to about 155' C. The solvent
initially swells the cellulose due to its relatively high polarity. Swelling of non-modified
cellulose may continue from about 1 hour to about 4 hours, in embodiments from about 1.5 hours
to about 2.5 hours. After the non-modified cellulose has swelled, the temperature of the mixture
is reduced. In embodiments, the mixture of non-modified cellulose may be cooled prior to
addition of the salt to a temperature from about 140' C to about 160' C, in embodiments from
about 1450 C to about 1550 C.
[00352]    The salt may be present in an amount of from about 0.1% by weight to 10% by weight
of the non-modified cellulose, in embodiments from about 0.5% by weight to about 9% by
weight of the non-modified cellulose. If the non-modified cellulose is not fully dissolved, the
process may continue with stirring and heating at a lower temperature, from about 400 C to about
800 C, in embodiments from about 500 C to about 600 C, for a period of time from about 12
hours to about 36 hours, in embodiments from about 16 hours to about 24 hours, until the non
modified cellulose is dissolved.
                                                    52

[00353] The dissolved oxidized cellulose may then be used to form macro, micro or
nanoparticles. In the present application, the terms "macroparticles," "macrospheres,"
"macrocapsules," "microparticles," "microspheres," "microcapsules," "nanoparticles,"
"nanospheres," and "nanocapsules" are used interchangeably and denote any particle having any
regular or irregular shape and size from about 0.001 pim to about 2 mm, in embodiments from
about .01 pim to about 1 mm.
[00354] Particle formation may be carried out either in as a continuous process with the
dissolution process (e.g., subjecting the solution to high shearing forces, adding neutralizing
agents, and/or adding cations) or a batch process. In embodiments, cellulose particles may be
formed by subjecting the dissolved cellulose to high shearing forces (e.g., in a high-shear
apparatus such as a mixer, extruder, and the like) in the presence of a solvent or non-solvent, a
neutralizing agent, an aqueous solution having multivalent cations, and combination thereof.
[00355] The term "non-solvent", as used herein, is used in its broadest sense and includes any
substance or mixture of substances in which cellulose is not soluble. Suitable solvents and co
solvents include, but are not limited to, NMP, DMAc and aqueous solutions, and combinations
thereof. Suitable non-solvents include, but are not limited to, alkanes, oils glycerins, glycols, and
combinations thereof. The solvent or non-solvent may be present in an amount of from about
1% by weight to 450%by weight of the cellulose, in embodiments from about 50% by weight to
about 30% by weight of the cellulose, in embodiments from about 10% by weight to 20% by
weight of the cellulose.
[00356] In embodiments, oxidized cellulose particles may be formed by contacting the
dissolved cellulose with an aqueous solution having a neutralizing agent. The dissolved
cellulose and the aqueous neutralizing solution may also be subjected to high shearing forces. In
                                                  53

embodiments, the neutralizing agent may be used to neutralize the pendant carboxyl acid groups
in the cellulose to regulate the final particle size and morphology, so a neutralizing agent herein
may also be referred to as a "basic neutralization agent." Any suitable basic neutralization
reagent may be used in accordance with the present disclosure. In embodiments, suitable basic
neutralization agents may include both inorganic basic agents and organic basic agents. Suitable
basic agents may include ammonia, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium
hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, lithium hydroxide, potassium carbonate,
potassium bicarbonate, combinations thereof, and the like. Suitable basic agents may also
include monocyclic compounds and polycyclic compounds having at least one nitrogen atom,
such as, for example, secondary amines, which include aziridines, azetidines, piperazines,
piperidines, pyridines, bipyridines, terpyridines, dihydropyridines, morpholines, N
alkylmorpholines, 1,4-diazabicyclo [2.2.2]octanes, 1,8-diazabicycloundecanes, 1,8
diazabicycloundecenes, dimethylated pentylamines, trimethylated pentylamines, pyrimidines,
pyrroles, pyrrolidines, pyrrolidinones, indoles, indolines, indanones, benzindazones, imidazoles,
benzimidazoles, imidazolones, imidazolines, oxazoles, isoxazoles, oxazolines, oxadiazoles,
thiadiazoles, carbazoles, quinolines, isoquinolines, naphthyridines, triazines, triazoles, tetrazoles,
pyrazoles, pyrazolines, and combinations thereof. In embodiments, the monocyclic and
polycyclic compounds may be unsubstituted or substituted at any carbon position on the ring.
[00357]    The neutralizing agent may be utilized as a solid such as, for example, sodium
hydroxide flakes and may be dissolved in water to form an aqueous solution. The neutralizing
agent may be added to the oxidized cellulose such that the pH of the solution is from about 5 to
about 9, in embodiments from about 6 to about 8. As noted above, the basic neutralization agent
may be added to neutralize the cellulose possessing carboxylic acid groups (e.g., oxidized
                                                    54

cellulose). Neutralization of the pendant carboxylic acids in the formation of cellulose particles
by minimizing inter-particle repulsion from anionic charges of the carboxylic acid groups. The
addition of the basic neutralization agent may thus raise the pH of an emulsion including a
cellulose possessing acid groups to a pH of from about 5 to about 12, in embodiments, from
about 6 to about 11.
[00358]    In embodiments, oxidized cellulose particles may be formed by contacting the
dissolved cellulose with an aqueous solution having multivalent cations, including divalent and
trivalent cations. The dissolved cellulose and the cation solution may also be subjected to high
shearing forces. In embodiments, cellulose particles may be formed by a continuous two-phase
spray preparation, in which a cation solution is initially sprayed onto a subtracted followed by
spraying of a dissolved cellulose solution. In further embodiments, a cationic solution may be
combined with an oxidized cellulose solution to form cross-linked gels in situ as described in
further detail below.
[00359]    Suitable cations include, but are not limited to, those of calcium (Ca    2 ), barium (Ba"2 ),
zinc (Zn- 2 ), magnesium (Mg- 2 ), iron (Fe-2 , Fe- 3 ), platinum (Pt-4 ), chromium (Cr+6), and
combinations thereof. In embodiments, the cation may be introduced by dissolving a suitable
salt of the cation, which include, but are not limited to, halides, sulfates, carbonates, phosphates,
nitrates, nitrites, oxides, acetates, combinations thereof, and the like. The cations may be present
in an amount of from about 0.010%by weight to 250%by weight of the oxidized cellulose, in
embodiments from about 1% by weight to about 18% by weight of the cellulose, in embodiments
from about 2% by weight to 15% by weight of the oxidized cellulose depending upon end use of
the oxidized cellulose solution. Cations act as cross-linking agents by cross-linking pendant
carboxylic groups disposed on oxidized cellulose thereby forming cellulose particles. A dual
                                                     55

compartment spraying device (e.g., micro-fluidizer) may be used which stores the aqueous cation
solution and the oxidized cellulose solution, which ejects the solution contemporaneously
thereby mixing the particles and forming particles that are deposited on a substrate (e.g., tissue).
Applicators for mixing two components are disclosed in commonly-owned U.S. Patent Nos.
7,611,494, 8,033,483, 8,152,777 and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2010/0065660
and 2010/009648 1, the entire disclosures of all of which are incorporated by reference herein.
[00360] In embodiments, the degree of oxidation of the oxidized cellulose particles formed
from the dissolved oxidized cellulose of the present disclosure may be from about 80% to about
120% of the degree of oxidation of the pre-processed, i.e., undissolved, oxidized cellulose, in
embodiments from about 90% to about 110%. In embodiments, the molecular weight of the
oxidized cellulose particles may be from about 80% to about 100% of the molecular weight of
the pre-processed, i.e., undissolved, oxidized cellulose, in embodiments from about 90% to about
95%. Undissolved (e.g., prior to dissolution) oxidized cellulose may have a molecular weight
from about 50,000 Daltons to about 500,000 Daltons, in embodiments from about 100,000
Daltons to about 400,000 Daltons.
[00361] The dissolved cellulose and/or cellulose particles may be used to form various medical
devices suitable for a variety of surgical and wound applications. The medical devices according
to the present disclosure may be any structure suitable for being attached or implanted into
tissue, body organs or lumens, including, but not limited to, micro and nano-particles, woven and
non-woven fabrics, coatings, patches, films, foams, slit sheets, pledgets, tissue grafts, stents,
scaffolds, buttresses, wound dressings, meshes, and/or tissue reinforcements.
[00362]    In embodiments, as noted above, one or more bioactive agents may be added to the
solvent such that the bioactive agents are incorporated into the oxidized cellulose solution, which
                                                 56

may then be used to form various medical devices. A variety of bioactive agents, including polar
and non-polar compounds, are soluble in the solvents described-above suitable for forming
oxidized cellulose solutions according to the present disclosure. In embodiments, the bioactive
agent may also be added after the oxidized cellulose particles have been formed. The terms
"bioactive agent" and "active therapeutic agent" (ATA) are used interchangeably and in its
broadest sense include any substance or mixture of substances that have clinical use.
Consequently, bioactive agents may or may not have pharmacological activity per se, e.g., a dye,
or fragrance. Alternatively a bioactive agent could be any agent that provides a therapeutic or
prophylactic effect, a compound that affects or participates in tissue growth, cell growth, cell
differentiation, an anti-adhesive compound, a compound that may be able to invoke a biological
action such as an immune response, or could play any other role in one or more biological
processes. It is envisioned that the bioactive agent may be applied to the present medical device
in any suitable form of matter, e.g., films, powders, liquids, gels and the like.
[00363] Examples of classes of bioactive agents which may be utilized in accordance with the
present disclosure include anti-adhesives, antimicrobials, analgesics, antipyretics, anesthetics,

polysaccharides, platelet activating drugs, clotting factors and enzymes. It is also intended that
combinations of bioactive agents may be used.
[00364] Anti-adhesive agents can be used to prevent adhesions from forming between the
implantable medical device and the surrounding tissues opposite the target tissue. In addition,
                                                  57

anti-adhesive agents may be used to prevent adhesions from forming between the coated
implantable medical device and the packaging material. Some examples of these agents include,

[00368]    The present disclosure also provides for compositions and methods of fabricating
microspheres encapsulating one or more bioactive agents within the oxidized cellulose. Suitable
bioactive agents are described in more detail above. Oxidized cellulose microspheres may have
                                                   59

a theoretical bioactive agent loading from about 80% to about 120%, in embodiments from about
90% to about 110%, in further embodiments from about 95% to about 105%, in additional
embodiments from about 98% to about 102%. Oxidized cellulose microspheres may have an
actual bioactive agent loading from about 0.01% to about 99.99%, in embodiments from about
15% to about 85%, in further embodiments from about 25% to about 55%, in additional
embodiments from about 40% to about 60%.
[00369] Soluble oxidized cellulose, by virtue of being dissolved in a polar solvent as described
above, allows for formation of microspheres including hydrophilic bioactive agents encapsulated
in the oxidized cellulose. This may be accomplished by using an oil-in-oil emulsion method
followed by a solvent extraction step in extraction media. As used herein the term "emulsion"
refers to a mixture of two or more liquids that are immiscible, in which one liquid form a
continuous phase and the other liquid forms a discontinuous phase. As used herein the terms
"discontinuous" and "disperse" phase are used interchangeably and refer to the compound being
dispersed through the continuous phase and may include the bioactive agent, optional
encapsulating polymer and/or corresponding solvent or solvating agent. As used herein the term
"continuous" phase refers to a liquid, such as, oils, that are used to extract the solvent or
solvating agent from the discontinuous phase. These liquids are usually immiscible with the
solvent employed in the discontinuous phase. As used herein the terms "thinning agent" and
"third" phase are used interchangeably and refer to a liquid that reduces the viscosity of the
continuous phase, is miscible with the continuous phase and/or removes residual continuous
phase from the surface of the microsphere. In embodiments, the thinning agent may be
immiscible with the discontinuous phase. As used herein the term "oil-in-oil" emulsion denotes
an emulsion in which both the continuous phase and the discontinuous phase are organic liquids.

[00370]    In forming microspheres of soluble oxidized cellulose by an oil-in-oil solvent
extraction method, one or more hydrophilic bioactive agents may be added to a solution of
oxidized cellulose and are mixed sufficiently to ensure a uniform suspension or homogeneous
solution. Oxidized cellulose may be present in the solution in an amount from about 0.01% by
weight to 450%by weight of the solution, in embodiments, from about 1% by weight to about
30% by weight of the solution, in embodiments from about 5% by weight to 20% by weight of
the solution.
[00371]    The bioactive agent and oxidized cellulose solution forms the discontinuous phase,
which is added drop-wise to a vessel including a liquid forming a continuous phase. The
continuous phase liquid may be any suitable non-polar compound that is immiscible with the
polar solvents used in forming the oxidized cellulose solution. Suitable continuous phase liquids
include, but are not limited to, petroleum-based oils, such as light, medium or heavy mineral oils
(e.g., mixtures of alkanes having from about 40 carbons to about 60 carbons), plant-based oils,
such as cottonseed oil, silicone-based oils, and combinations thereof. In embodiments, the
continuous phase may include two or more oils such as, for example, a heavy oil and a light oil,
that compete for extraction of the discontinuous phase. In embodiments, the heavy oil and the
light oil may be present at a ratio of from about 1:10 to about 10:1, in embodiments from about
1:3 to about 3:1. The discontinuous phase liquid may be present in an amount from about 1% by
volume to about 50% by volume of the continuous phase liquid, in embodiments from about 5%
to about  2 0 %.
[00372]    The vessel possessing the continuous phase may be fitted with a baffle.   The vessel
may include a mixer with an impeller configured to rotate at a rate of from about 25 rpm to about
60,000 rpm, in embodiments, from about 100 rpm to about 15,000 rpm, in further embodiments
                                                 61

from about 250 rpm to about 5,000 rpm. The stirring may continue from about 5 seconds to
about 4 hours, in embodiments, from about 15 seconds to about 1 hour. The rate of rotation may
be adjusted to obtain desired particle size. Size of the microspheres may be tailored by
modulating the duration and the speed of homogenization (e.g., stirring of the discontinuous and
continuous phases), temperature and/or pressure, altering the ratio of continuous to discontinuous
phases, the shear rate, and the molecular weight and concentrations of oxidized cellulose and
bioactive agents.
[00373] Upon completing the transfer of the discontinuous phase solution into the continuous
phase, a third phase liquid may be added to the emulsion to remove the solvent from the
discontinuous phase liquid. Suitable third phase liquids include any compound which is miscible
with both the continuous and discontinuous phase liquids. The extraction of the solvent occurs
due to the solvent being immiscible in the continuous phase liquid but miscible in the third phase
liquid. Suitable third phase liquids include isopropyl myristate, hexane, n-heptane, triglycerides
and combinations thereof. The third phase liquid may be present in an amount from about 300%
by volume to about 200% by volume of the continuous phase liquid, in embodiments from about
140% to about 150%.
[00374]   Removal of the solvent from the continuous phase facilitates formation of
microspheres including the bioactive agent encapsulated by the oxidized cellulose. The
emulsion may be stirred from about 0.1 hour to about 24 hours, in embodiments from about 2
hours to about 5 hours, to aid in the extraction of the polar solvent from the microspheres. The
microspheres may then be collected via filtration and washed (e.g., with n-heptane) to remove
any trace of continuous and discontinuous phase liquids on the surface of the microspheres. The
microspheres may then be collected and transferred into a glass scintillation vial under a nitrogen
                                                  62

or argon overlay. In embodiments, microspheres may also be formed using spray dry and jet
mill techniques.
[00375]     The oxidized cellulose microspheres are also suitable for encapsulating hydrophilic
drugs such as bupivacaine HCl as well as viruses, bacteria, amino acids, peptides, proteins,
lipids, vaccines, and combinations thereof since the oil-in-oil emulsion does not react with the
water barrier of these bioactive agents.
[00376]    In other embodiments, the oxidized cellulose solution may also be used to form various
types of fibers. In embodiments, fibers may be solid, hollow, porous, and combinations thereof.
Fibers may be formed by any suitable method, including electrospinning, solution casting,
extruding, and combinations thereof. The fibers formed from the oxidized cellulose solutions
may be used to form a variety of medical devices. The medical devices according to the present
disclosure may be any structure suitable for being attached or implanted into tissue. Suitable
structures formed from the fibers include, for example, films, foams, slit sheets, pledgets, tissue
grafts, stents, scaffolds, buttresses, wound dressings, meshes, and/or tissue reinforcements. In
embodiments, the fibers may be used to form non-woven meshes or tapes, which may be used as
passive hemostats. The non-woven structure of a fibrous mesh formed from an oxidized
cellulose solution lends itself to use as a wound dressing, due to its ability to filter liquids and/or
gases.
[00377]    The oxidized cellulose solution may also be used to form films and/or coatings.
Coatings or films may be formed by depositing the solution by itself or on a substrate solution
casting, dipping, layering, calendaring, spraying, and combinations thereof. The solvent
evaporates, thereby forming the film or coating on a substrate. The films may be incorporated
                                                  63

onto other medical devices by applying the solution to the surface of the device, or portion
thereof, utilizing any suitable method within the purview of those skilled in the art.
[00378] In embodiments, the oxidized cellulose solution may be used to form a sprayable
delivery vehicle. In further embodiments, the oxidized cellulose solution may be combined with
a second composition that forms a gel or effects precipitation of the oxidized cellulose as
described in further detail below.
[00379]    The viscosity of the solution for forming fibers, films, and other medical devices may
be adjusted to achieve a desired viscosity. This may be accomplished by adding one or more
plasticizers. Examples of suitable plasticizers include any biocompatible plasticizer, such as
lecithin, dibutyl sebacate, citric acid, alcohol esters, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene
glycol, and combinations thereof.
[00380] Uses for medical devices formed from the dissolved oxidized cellulose include closing
and healing visceral wall defects and incisions, including incisions due to the removal of tumors,
wounds, anastomoses, and fistulae. The medical devices can improve the healing of a gastro
intestinal anastomosis and may provide an effective approach for the management and
prevention of fistula. The medical devices may also prevent complications of polypectomy (e.g.,
bleeding and perforation). In embodiments, the medical devices may be reinforced with a mesh
(e.g., formed on a substrate mesh) for the treatment of inguinal hernia and/or incisional hernia.
[00381]    The rate of in vitro and in vivo biodegradation of medical devices formed from
oxidized cellulose may be regulated by controlling the initial degree of oxidation of the resultant
(e.g., dissolved and processed) oxidized cellulose. The greater the degree of oxidation of the
oxidized cellulose, the faster the rate of biodegradation in vitro and in vivo. The present
disclosure provides for processes that minimize the degradation of the oxidized cellulose during
                                                   64

the dissolution process, thereby providing for cellulose having a desired degree of oxidation.
Further, biodegradability of cellulose may be controlled by adjusting the molecular weight and
degree of oxidation during the dissolution to provide for predictably degrading oxidized cellulose
having a predictable degradation profile. A predictable degradation profile denotes a known or
predetermined rate of degradation that may be used to estimate the degradation duration of the
oxidized cellulose. Dissolving and processing without materially affecting the degree of
oxidation allows for predictable biodegradability of the final products (e.g., medical devices).
Thus, control of the rate of degradation of the oxidized cellulose matrix may be accomplished by
varying the degree of oxidation, thereby controlling the rate of bioactive agent elution. The
degree of oxidation of the oxidized cellulose may also be adjusted during the dissolution process
to achieve a desired degree of oxidation.
[00382] Dissolved oxidized cellulose may also be utilized to form in situ gels. Oxidized
cellulose solution may be prepared using the methods, e.g., solvents, conditions, etc., outlined
above. The oxidized cellulose solution may have a pH from about from about 7.0 to about 10.0,
in embodiments from about 8.0 to about 9.5. The oxidized cellulose solution may be combined
with a gelation composition that, upon contacting the oxidized cellulose solution, forms a gel.
The gel may be used as an adhesive to seal tissue and/or to provide for delivery of bioactive
agents as described in further detail below.
[00383] In embodiments, the oxidized cellulose solution may be combined with a cationic
material, such as a cationic polysaccharide. In embodiments, the cationic polysaccharide may be
chitosan, carboxymethyl chitin, guar gum, and combinations, optionally in solution. Chitosan is
a natural linear co-polymer of N-acetyl D-glucosamine (acetylated unit) and D-glucosamine
(non-acetylated unit). Chitosan may be produced by partial or full deacetylation of chitin.
                                                 65

Chitin may be extracted from natural sources, e.g., squid, exoskeletons of crustaceans such as
shrimp, or vegetable sources such as mushrooms. Chitosan may also be synthetically produced
or synthesized by modified microorganisms such as bacteria.
[00384] The adhesion of chitosan with other polysaccharides, such as cellulose, includes
different kinds of interactions, such as electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and
hydrophobic interactions, resulting in ionic cross-linking with the oxidized cellulose. Chitosan,
under certain circumstances, is a cationic polymer containing NH) groups. The positively
charged primary amino groups of chitosan attract anionic groups of other polymers. Thus,
chitosan and anionic polymers are able to form polyelectrolyte complexes. Polyelectrolyte
complex formation may improve the mechanical properties of the polymers and lead to new
structures, such as precipitates, films, fibers, and gels.
[00385] Adhesion of chitosan with other polymers may also be promoted by enhancing the
mechanical properties of the formulation by creating covalent bonds between both the
components of the adhesive formulation. Chitosan has NH 2 groups which can react covalently
with carboxyl groups. Thus, chitosan may be mixed with functionalized polymers having
carboxyl groups, such as oxidized cellulose.
[00386]    The chitosan may have a molecular weight from about 1,000 g/mol to about 5,000,000
g/mol, in embodiments from about 5,000 g/mol to about 220,000 g/mol. In embodiments,
chitosan has a high molecular weight (HMW) of from about 450,000 g/mol to about 550,000
g/mol. In other embodiments, chitosan has a low molecular weight (LMW) of from about
50,000 g/mol to about 150,000 g/mol.
[00387] A solution of chitosan may be prepared, in embodiments, by dissolving chitosan in
distilled water with a stoichiometric amount of acid, such as HCl or acetic acid, to ensure the
                                                   66

complete protonation of all NH 2 groups. The final solution may contain from about 0.5% (w/w)
to about 5% (w/w) chitosan, in embodiments from about 2% (w/w) to about 4% (w/w) chitosan.
The chitosan solution may have a pH from about from about 1.0 to about 7.0, in embodiments
from about 2.0 to about 6.0. The lower pH of the chitosan solution allows for suspension of pH
sensitive bioactive agents in one of the solutions, either oxidized cellulose or chitosan, without
compromising the bioactivity of the pH sensitive bioactive agents.
[00388] In embodiments, bioactive agents, whose bioactivity is reduced or destroyed by high
pH, such as chemotherapeutic encapsulated polypeptides, may be suspended in a chitosan
solution and incorporated into an in-situ forming gel upon contact with an oxidized cellulose
solution. This gel can be fixed onto a targeted site, such as organs, tissue, etc. and anchor the
encapsulated peptide, which then can be released. The resulting gel may be either neutral pH
upon formation, or the pH can be adjusted, using the pH of the chitosan solution or the oxidized
cellulose solution, to provide a friendly pH environment for the bioactivity of the peptide to be
maintained.
[00389] Another suitable composition for gelation with the oxidized cellulose solution includes
an aqueous solution of multi-valent cations, which forms a gel by ionic cross-linking of the
oxidized cellulose and cations. Suitable cations include, but are not limited to, those of calcium
(Ca- 2 ), barium (Ba- 2), zinc (Zn-2), magnesium (Mg- 2 ), iron (Fe- 2 , Fe-3 ), platinum (Pt 4 ),
chromium (Cr+6), and combinations thereof. In embodiments, the cations may be introduced by
dissolving a suitable salt of the cations, which include, but are not limited to, halides, sulfates,
carbonates, phosphates, nitrates, nitrites, oxides, combinations thereof, and the like in a suitable
solvent such as water, methanol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The cations may be present
in an amount of from about 0.010%by weight to 250% by weight of the solution, in embodiments
                                                  67

from about 1%by weight to about 18% by weight of the solution, in embodiments from about
2% by weight to 15% by weight of the solution, to achieve a desired mix ratio with the oxidized
cellulose solution. The oxidized cellulose solution and the cationic solution form a reversible,
ionically cross-linked gel. In embodiments, the gel can be made reversible by the addition of
anionic solutions including aqueous solutions having a pH of greater than 7.0, such as solutions
of urea, ammonia, amino acids such as, lysine and glycine, anionic polysaccharides such as,
alginate, dextran, carboxymethyl cellulose, and combinations thereof.
[00390] A solution of oxidized cellulose may also be contacted with a precipitation and/or
gelation composition that forms a gel by dilution and/or precipitation of the oxidized cellulose.
Precipitation may be accomplished by contacting the oxidized cellulose solution with a
composition including a solvent or a non-solvent. Suitable gelation compositions include, but
are not limited to, water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, and combinations thereof. In
embodiments, an aqueous solution of carboxymethyl cellulose may also be used.
Carboxymethyl cellulose ("CMC") may be present in the solution from about 0.5% by weight or
volume to about 5% by weight or volume, in embodiments, from about 1%by weight or volume
to about 2% by weight or volume.
[00391] In embodiments, an aqueous solution of any cross-linker having one or more primary
amines including, but not limited to, trilysine, albumin, polyethylene glycol amine, and
combinations thereof may be used as a precipitating gelation composition. In further
embodiments, an aqueous solution of any suitable Schiff-base compound may also be used as a
precipitating gelation composition. As used herein, the term "Schiff-base" compound denotes
any compound having a functional group including a carbon-nitrogen double bond with the
nitrogen atom connected to an aryl or an alkyl group having a general formula R1R2 C=NR 3,
                                                  68

where R3 and at least one of R 1 or R2 is an aryl or an alkyl group. Suitable Schiff-base
compounds include, but are not limited to, amoxicillin, cephalexin, 2,2-dimethyl
benzimidazoline, 2-methyl-2-ethyl benzimidazoline, 2-methyl-2-propyl benzimidazoline, 2
methyl-2-butyl benzimidazoline, 2-methyl-2-hexyl benzimidazoline, 2-methyl-2-decyl
benzimidazoline, 2,2-dimethyl-5-methylbenzimidazoline, 2-methyl-2-butyl-6-methyl
benzimidazoline, 2,2-diethyl benzimidazoline, 2,2-diethyl benzimidazoline, 2-ethyl-2-hexyl
benzimidazoline, 2-methyl-2-isoamyl-5-methyl benzimidazoline, 2,2-dioctyl benzimidazoline,
2,2-didecyl benzimidazoline, 2-propyl-2-pentyl benzimidazoline, 2,2-diethyl-6
ethylbenzimidazoline, 2,2-dipropyl-5-isopropylbenzimidazoline, 2,2-dipropyl-5
methylbenzimidazoline, 2,2-dibutyl-6-methylbenzimidazoline, 2,2-dibutyl-6
dodecylbenzimidazoline, 2-methyl-2-propenyl benzimidazoline, 2-ethyl-2-propenyl-5
methylbenzimidazoline, 2-methyl-2-butenyl benzimidazoline, 2-ethyl-2-butenyl-6
methylbenzimidazoline, 2,2-dihexyl benzimidazoline, 2,2-dihexyl-5-methylbenzimidazoline, and
combinations thereof     Contacting of Schiff-base compound and/or small molecule cross-linker
solutions with the oxidized cellulose solution results in covalent cross-linking of the oxidized
cellulose, which, in turn, produces the gel. In embodiments, the aqueous solution may include
CMC as well as the Schiff-base compounds.
[00392]    In embodiments, a solution of one or more acrylic polymers may also be used to
precipitate oxidized cellulose to form gels according to the present disclosure. Suitable acrylic
polymers include, but are not limited to, those based on methyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl
acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, glyceryl acrylate, glyceryl methacrylate, acrylic acid,
methacrylic acid, acrylamide, methacrylamide, and combinations thereof. Suitable solvents
include acetone, ethyl acetate, dimethyl ether, and combinations thereof.
                                                  69

[00393] Upon contact of the oxidized cellulose solution with the precipitating composition, the
gel is formed in situ by the dilution of the solvent used to form the oxidized cellulose solution
and the subsequent precipitation of the oxidized cellulose. Since the polar solvent of the
oxidized cellulose solution is miscible with water and/or organic solvents described above,
oxidized cellulose precipitates out in the form of a gel due to the dilution of the solvent.
[00394]    In embodiments, the precipitating composition may include a bioactive agent, which
may be suspended in the precipitating composition. In embodiments, the bioactive agent may be
initially suspended in the precipitating composition as a plurality of microspheres as described
above. The microspheres may then be re-suspended in either the oxidized cellulose composition
and/or the gelation composition. The resulting oxidized cellulose gel prevents the migration of
the microspheres from the target site.
[00395] As noted above, the gels formed by the solutions of oxidized cellulose and gelation
compositions can be used to deliver bioactive agents to tissue or the gels may be used to form
articles or coatings thereon containing bioactive agents. The gels anchor the bioactive agents,
microspheres, microparticles, and combinations thereof, to target sites, e.g., organs, tissues, etc.
Microspheres and microparticles containing bioactive agents may be formed using the methods
described above by suspending desired bioactive agents in the oxidized cellulose solution prior
to microsphere or microparticle formation. The resulting particles may be suspended in the
oxidized cellulose solution, which then may be combined with the cationic and/or chitosan
solutions. This may be utilized to secure bioactive agents at the desired sites, including
chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)) at tumor excision sites, to
provide for sustained release of chemotherapeutic agents from the gel and/or the microparticles
secured thereby.
                                                  70

[00396] The gelation compositions and/or oxidized cellulose solution may be in a liquid form
and placed in a syringe or any other suitable delivery vehicle, such as a sprayer, for immediate or
later use. The solutions may be placed in delivery vehicles of different volumes so as to reach a
specific ratio of each component.
[00397]    The solutions may be applied convergently to a desired tissue site to form a gel
thereon. As used herein, the term "convergently" denotes at least partial overlap of the
compositions being applied to the substrate (e.g., tissue, medical device, etc.) either during the
application process (e.g., mid-stream) or on a surface of the substrate.
[00398]    The solutions used to form the gel may also be directly coated on a substrate, such as a
mesh. The substrate may be prepared by soaking it in the desired solutions and drying (e.g., in
an oven or in a laminar flow hood). In embodiments, the process may be repeated several times
to ensure a proper coating displaying the required adhesive properties for the selected indication
of use, e.g., fixation of extraperitoneal or retroperitoneal meshes, skin flap closure, etc.
[00399]    The ratio of each component may be adjusted to provide a desired formulation. Each
formulation is characterized by its mix ratio (MR). As used herein, the term "mix ratio" means
the amount of the compound and/or reactive groups responsible for gelation (e.g., free amine
groups of chitosan and/or amount of cations) versus the amount of free carboxyl groups present
on the oxidized cellulose. The mix ratio may be at least about 1, in embodiments from about 1 to
about 40, in further embodiments from about 10 to about 30. In embodiments, each component
of the gel may be diluted with a buffer prior to use for pH adjustment.
[00400]    The present disclosure also provides for compositions and methods of fabricating
microspheres having additional microspheres therein encapsulating one or more APIs or
bioactive agents. Fig. 2 shows a microsphere 20 having one or more microspheres 22
                                                   71

encapsulated therein. As used herein, "multi-encapsulated microspheres" denote the
encapsulation of one or more smaller microspheres 22, e.g., particles, spheres, capsules, and
combinations thereof in a single larger microsphere 20. In embodiments, multi-encapsulated
microspheres may encapsulate one or more bioactive agents at same or different loading levels.
[00401] In a so-called "primary encapsulation," soluble oxidized cellulose may be used to
encapsulate a bioactive agent, a water-soluble compound, a water-sensitive chemotherapeutic
agent and/or active pharmaceutical ingredient, thereby forming oxidized cellulose microspheres,
e.g., microspheres 22, as described above. Primary encapsulation with soluble oxidized cellulose
may be carried out using emulsion-based solvent evaporation and/or extraction methods
including, but not limited to, single-emulsion methods such as oil-in-water (o/w) and water-in-oil
(w/o), double-emulsion methods such as water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) and solid-in-oil-in-water
(s/o/w), and non-emulsion based methods, such as fluidized-bed, spray-drying, and
casting/grinding methods. The primary oxidized cellulose microspheres may then be further
encapsulated in a second layer of oxidized cellulose encapsulation, or in another biodegradable
polymer, other than oxidized cellulose, in a so-called "secondary encapsulation" forming the
microsphere 20 encapsulating the microspheres 22.
[00402] As used herein, the term "biodegradable" in reference to a material shall refer to the
property of the material being able to be absorbed by the body. In the present application, the
terms "biodegradable," "bioresorbable," "bioerodable," and "bioabsorbable" are used
interchangeably and are intended to mean the characteristic according to which a material
decomposes, or loses structural integrity under body conditions (e.g., enzymatic degradation or
hydrolysis) or are broken down (physically or chemically) under physiologic conditions in the
body, such that the degradation products are excretable or absorbable by the body after a given
                                                 72

period of time. The time period may vary, from about one hour to about several months or more,
depending on the chemical nature of the material. In embodiments, the material may not be
completely absorbed, provided the non-absorbed material is acceptable for medical use.
[00403] Oxidized cellulose microspheres may be formed using oil-in-oil emulsification
processes described above. The oxidized cellulose microspheres may then be further micro
encapsulated by using emulsion-based solvent evaporation methods, in which the oxidized
cellulose microspheres are suspended in a solution of a biodegradable polymer or cross-linked
and further encapsulated in another oxidized cellulose microencapsulation process. The solution
may include any suitable biodegradable polymer, a solvent, and an optional emulsifier and/or a
surfactant. In embodiments, additional bioactive agents may be added to the biodegradable
polymer solution, which may be the same or different from the bioactive agent included in the
oxidized cellulose microspheres. In further embodiments, some rounds of encapsulation may
include no bioactive agents based on the desired use and/or performance characteristics of multi
encapsulated microspheres (e.g., altered release rate).
[00404]   Suitable biodegradable polymers used to form microspheres according to the present
disclosure include, but are not limited to, aliphatic polyesters, polyamides, polyamines,
polyalkylene oxalates, poly(anhydrides), polyamidoesters, copoly(ether-esters), poly(carbonates)
including tyrosine derived carbonates, poly(hydroxyalkanoates) such as poly(hydroxybutyric
acid), poly(hydroxyvaleric acid), and poly(hydroxybutyrate), polyimide carbonates, poly(imino
carbonates) such as such as poly (bisphenol A-iminocarbonate and the like), polyorthoesters,
polyoxaesters including those containing amine groups, polyphosphazenes, poly (propylene
fumarates), polyurethanes, polymer drugs such as polydiflunisol, polyaspirin, and protein
                                                  73

therapeutics, biologically modified (e.g., protein, peptide) bioabsorbable polymers, and
copolymers, block copolymers, homopolymers, blends, and combinations thereof.
[00405]    More specifically, aliphatic polyesters include, but are not limited to, polylactide,
polylactide-co-glycolide, polylactide-polycaprolactone, homopolymers and copolymers of
lactide (including lactic acid, D-,L- and meso lactide), glycolide (including glycolic acid),
epsilon-caprolactone, p-dioxanone (1,4-dioxan-2-one), trimethylene carbonate (1,3-dioxan-2
one), alkyl derivatives of trimethylene carbonate, A-valerolactone, P-butyrolactone, y
butyrolactone, g-decalactone, hydroxybutyrate, hydroxyvalerate, 1,4-dioxepan-2-one (including
its dimer 1,5,8,12-tetraoxacyclotetradecane-7,14-dione), 1,5-dioxepan-2-one, 6,6-dimethyl- 1,4
dioxan-2-one, 2,5-diketomorpholine, pivalolactone, a, a diethylpropiolactone, ethylene
carbonate, ethylene oxalate, 3-methyl-1,4-dioxane-2,5-dione, 3,3-diethyl-1,4-dioxan-2,5-dione,
6,8-dioxabicycloctane-7-one, and polymer blends and copolymers thereof.
[00406]    Suitable solvents for forming the biodegradable polymer solution of the discontinuous
phase for secondary encapsulation include, but are not limited to, ethyl acetate, methylene
chloride, perchloroethane, trichloroethylene, hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), chloroform,
tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl formamide, as well as those pharmaceutical solvents listed in the ICH
Q3C (International Conference on Harmonization - residual solvents used in pharmaceutical
processing) and combinations thereof.
[00407]    The emulsifier may be present in an amount from about 0.01% by weight and/or
volume to about 250%by weight and/or volume of the solvent, in embodiments from about 0.1%
by weight and/or volume to about 10% by weight and/or volume of the solvent, in further
embodiments from about 0.5% by weight and/or volume to about 5% by weight and/or volume
of the solvent. For oil-in-oil processes, the use of an emulsifier is optional. Suitable emulsifiers
                                                  74

include, but are not limited to, water-soluble polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohol ("PVA"),
polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG),
PLURONICS TM, TWEENS TM, polysaccharides, phospholipids, and combinations thereof.
[00408] The continuous phase for the secondary encapsulation may also include a surfactant to
stabilize the microspheres and adjust the bioactive agent loading efficiency. One, two, or more
surfactants may be utilized. Examples surfactants that can be utilized include, for example,
polyacrylic acid, methalose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, propyl cellulose, hydroxy ethyl
cellulose, carboxy methyl cellulose, polyoxyethylene cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene lauryl ether,
polyoxyethylene octyl ether, polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, polyoxyethylene oleyl ether,
polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate, polyoxyethylene stearyl ether, polyoxyethylene
nonylphenyl ether, dialkylphenoxy poly(ethyleneoxy) ethanol, polyoxamers, combinations
thereof, and the like.
[00409]    Secondary encapsulation of oxidized cellulose microspheres may include cross-linking
the microspheres to stabilize subsequent encapsulation and then forming a suspension of the
microspheres in the biodegradable polymer solution described above. Oxidized cellulose
microspheres may be cross-linked using any of the cationic species described above. The
suspension may then be vortexed or intimately stirred to form an emulsion. In embodiments, the
oxidized cellulose microspheres may be immediately suspended in the biodegradable polymer
solution without cross-linking.
[00410]    Emulsion-based solvent evaporation may be accomplished by stirring the suspension or
emulsion at a rate from about 25 rpm to about 60,000 rpm, in embodiments, from about 100 rpm
to about 15,000 rpm, in further embodiments from about 250 rpm to about 5,000 rpm. The
emulsion may be stirred for a period of time from about 5 seconds to about 4 hours, in
                                                 75

embodiments, from about 15 seconds to about 1 hour. Stirring may also be used to remove the
discontinuous phase solvent from the emulsion, retaining the doubly-encased microspheres, or
the multi-encased microspheres, i.e., the multi-encapsulated formulation.
[00411] For the second round of encapsulation, the solvent may be evaporated and/or extracted.
After the solvent is evaporated and/or extracted, the emulsion retains the microspheres formed
from the biodegradable polymer encapsulating the oxidized cellulose microspheres. The
emulsion also includes free unencapsulated oxidized cellulose microspheres that are suspended
in the emulsion. The size of the doubly-encased or multi-encased microspheres may be from
about 0.00 1 pim to about 2 mm, in embodiments the size of the microspheres may be from about
0.01 pim to about 1 mm, in further embodiments the size of the microspheres may be from about
0.1 pim to about 500 pim. Size of the microspheres may be tailored by modulating the duration
and the speed of stirring, temperature and/or pressure, altering the ratio of continuous to
discontinuous phases, the shear rate created during stirring, and the molecular weight and
concentrations of biodegradable polymers, emulsifiers, and surfactants, and other variables
within purview of a person skilled in the art.
[00412] The primary encapsulation by the oxidized cellulose protects the bioactive agent from
organic solvents and/or other conditions used in any subsequent rounds of encapsulation.
Oxidized cellulosed may be used to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic bioactive
agents. While hydrophobic bioactive agents can also be encapsulated using emulsion methods
including other biodegradable polymers, encapsulation of hydrophilic bioactive agents is
particularly facilitated by dissolved oxidized cellulose.
[00413] Soluble oxidized cellulose, by virtue of being dissolved in a polar solvent as described
above, allows for formation of microspheres including hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic bioactive
                                                 76

agents encapsulated in the oxidized cellulose whereas other biodegradable polymers are better
suited to encapsulate hydrophobic bioactive agents. Using oxidized cellulose for the first round
of microencapsulation is beneficial since it does not dissolve in most polar or non-polar solvents,
with the exception of solvents listed above with respect to dissolution of oxidized cellulose, thus
eliminating the risk of microsphere dissolution during the second round of encapsulation. This
allows for microencapsulation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic bioactive agents, which can
then be encapsulated into another microsphere.
[00414] In embodiments, the first layer of any microspheres may be formed using a
biodegradable polymer other than oxidized cellulose using above-described encapsulation
methods, which can then be further encapsulated in oxidized cellulose microspheres. Primary
encapsulation of bioactive agents using biodegradable polymers may be carried out using
emulsion-based solvent evaporation methods including, but not limited to, single-emulsion
methods such as oil-in-water (o/w) and water-in-oil (w/o), double-emulsion methods such as
water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) and solid-in-oil-in-water (s/o/w), and non-emulsion based
methods, such as fluidized-bed, spray-drying, and casting/grinding methods.
[00415] Where a bioactive agent is first encapsulated in a biodegradable polymer, the bioactive
agent may be dissolved in a solution to form a discontinuous phase. Suitable solvents for
dissolving bioactive agents could be aqueous and/or organic and include water, saline, methylene
chloride, chloroform, and alcohols, examples of which include methanol, ethanol, combinations
thereof, and the like. Biodegradable polymer may also be dissolved to form a discontinuous
phase using the solvents described above. Homogenization may be used for discontinuous
phases if particle size reduction in the loading of the microsphere is desired. Homogenization
may be carried by any suitable methods within the purview of one skilled in the art including, but
                                                  77

not limited to, stirring, grinding, thermal energy, ultrasound energy, combinations thereof, and
the like.
[00416] Emulsion-based solvent evaporation may be accomplished by stirring the suspension or
emulsion at a rate from about 25 rpm to about 60,000 rpm, in embodiments, from about 100 rpm
to about 15,000 rpm, in further embodiments from about 250 rpm to about 5,000 rpm. The
emulsion may be stirred for a period of time from about 5 seconds to about 4 hours, in
embodiments, from about 15 seconds to about 1 hour. Stirring may also be used to remove the
discontinuous phase solvent from the emulsion, retaining the doubly-encased microspheres.
[00417] After the solvent is evaporated, the emulsion retains the microspheres formed from the
biodegradable polymer encapsulating the bioactive agent. The emulsion also includes free
unencapsulated portion of the bioactive agent that is suspended in the emulsion. The size of the
microspheres may be from about 0.00 1 pim to about 2 mm, in embodiments the size of the
microspheres may be from about 0.01 pim to about 1 mm, in further embodiments the size of the
microspheres may be from about 0.1 pim to about 500 pim. Size of the microspheres may be
tailored by modulating the duration and the speed of stirring, temperature and/or pressure,
altering the ratio of continuous to discontinuous phases, the shear rate created during stirring, and
the molecular weight and concentrations of biodegradable polymers, emulsifiers, and surfactants,
and other variables within purview of a person skilled in the art.
[00418]    The microspheres formed from the biodegradable polymers other than oxidized
cellulose may then be suspended in a solution of oxidized cellulose, which is formed according
to the processes described above. In forming microspheres of soluble oxidized cellulose by a
solid-in-oil-in-oil solvent extraction method, the biodegradable polymer microspheres may be
added to a solution of oxidized cellulose and are mixed sufficiently to ensure a uniform
                                                  78

suspension. Oxidized cellulose may be present in the solution in an amount from about 0.01%
by weight to 450%by weight of the solution, in embodiments, from about 1% by weight to about
30% by weight of the solution, in embodiments from about 5%by weight to 20% by weight of
the solution. In embodiments, additional bioactive agents may be added to the oxidized cellulose
solution which may be the same or different from the bioactive agents of the biodegradable
polymer microspheres (e.g., hydrophilic vs hydrophobic bioactive agents).
[00419] The microspheres, the oxidized cellulose solution, and additional bioactive agents, if
any, form the discontinuous phase, which is added drop-wise to a vessel including a liquid
forming a continuous phase. The continuous phase liquid may be any suitable non-polar
compound that is immiscible with the polar solvents used in forming the oxidized cellulose
solution. Suitable continuous phase liquids include, but are not limited to, light, medium or
heavy mineral oil (e.g., mixtures of alkanes having from about 40 carbons to about 60 carbons),
cottonseed oil, and combinations thereof. Additional continuous phase may be added during
emulsification. The discontinuous phase liquid may be present in an amount from about 2% by
volume to about 40% by volume of the continuous phase liquid, in embodiments from about 5%
to about 2 0 %.
[00420] Emulsion-based solvent evaporation may be accomplished by stirring the suspension or
emulsion at a rate from about 25 rpm to about 60,000 rpm, in embodiments, from about 100 rpm
to about 15,000 rpm, in further embodiments from about 250 rpm to about 5,000 rpm. The
emulsion may be stirred for a period of time from about 5 seconds to about 4 hours, in
embodiments, from about 15 seconds to about 1 hour. Stirring may also be used to remove the
discontinuous phase solvent from the emulsion, retaining the doubly-encased microspheres.
                                                79

[00421] Upon completing the transfer of the discontinuous phase solution into the continuous
phase, a third phase liquid may be added to the emulsion to remove or extract the solvent from
the discontinuous phase liquid. Suitable third phase liquids include any compound which is
miscible with the continuous and may be miscible with discontinuous phase solvent. The
extraction of the solvent occurs due to the solvent being immiscible in the continuous phase
liquid but miscible in the third phase liquid. Suitable third phase liquids include isopropyl
myristate, hexane, triglycerides and combinations thereof. The third phase liquid may be present
in an amount from about 300% by volume to about 200% by volume of the continuous phase
liquid, in embodiments from about 140% to about 150%.
[00422]    Extraction of the solvent from the discontinuous phase facilitates formation of doubly
encased microspheres including the bioactive agent encapsulated by a biodegradable polymer,
other than oxidized cellulose and then further encapsulated by the oxidized cellulose. The
emulsion may be stirred from about 0.1 hour to about 24 hours, in embodiments from about 2
hours to about 5 hours, to aid in the extraction of the polar solvent from the microspheres. The
microspheres may then be collected via filtration and washed (e.g., with n-heptane) to remove
any trace of continuous and discontinuous phase liquids on the surface of the microspheres. The
microspheres may then be collected and transferred into a glass scintillation vial under a nitrogen
or argon overlay. In embodiments, the microspheres may be cross-linked with a cationic
solution and then dried.
[00423]    In further embodiments, as shown in Fig. 3, doubly-encapsulated microspheres 32,
such as those encapsulating microspheres 34, may then be further encapsulated in either
additional microspheres 30 formed from biodegradable polymer or the oxidized cellulose,
depending on the material utilized in the second layer encapsulation. In other words, oxidized
                                                  80

cellulose is utilized for every other (e.g., alternate) round of encapsulation (e.g., microspheres 30
and 34) with adjacent rounds (e.g., microsphere 32) being formed using biodegradable polymers
other than oxidized cellulose. Thus, in embodiments where dissolved oxidized cellulose was
used in the initial round of encapsulation (e.g., to form the microsphere 34), biodegradable
polymers may be used for the second, (e.g., to form the microsphere 32) fourth, sixth, etc.
rounds, and with oxidized cellulose being used in third (e.g., to form the microsphere 30), fifth,
seventh, etc. rounds. Conversely, in embodiments where biodegradable polymers are used in the
initial round of encapsulation (e.g., to form the microsphere 34), dissolved oxidized cellulose
may be used for the second (e.g., to form the microsphere 32), fourth, sixth, etc. rounds, and with
the biodegradable polymers being used in third (e.g., to form the microsphere 30), fifth, seventh,
etc. rounds. Subsequent encapsulation using dissolved oxidized cellulose and/or biodegradable
polymers may be carried out in the manner described above with respect corresponding
encapsulation steps. In further embodiments, every multi-encapsulated layer may be formed
from oxidized cellulose.
[00424] Multiple encapsulating microspheres offer several therapeutic advantages such as, for
example, sequential release of multiple bioactive agents as illustrated in plots 40 and 50 of Figs.
4 and 5. The plot 40 illustrate a release profile of a multi-encapsulated microsphere, e.g.,
microsphere 30, having three unique bioactive agents A, B, and C encapsulated within each of
the microspheres 30, 32, 34, respectively. As the microsphere 30 degrades, the bioactive agent A
is released, with the release profile decaying over time corresponding to the degradation of the
microsphere 30. Thereafter, first encapsulated microsphere 32 begins to degrade, thereby
releasing the bioactive agent B. Finally, the third bioactive agent C is released once the
microsphere 34 commences degradation. Release profiles of each of the bioactive agents A, B,
                                                    81

and C may be tailored by adjusting the amount of the encapsulation material (e.g., oxidized
cellulose and/or biodegradable polymers). In embodiments, the release profiles may overlap
such that one bioactive agent (e.g., A) is released concurrently with another bioactive agent (e.g.,
B). In further embodiments, the release profiles of each of the bioactive agents may be discrete
(e.g., not overlapping) based on desired use and therapy requirements.
[00425] The plot 50 illustrates a release profile of a multi-encapsulated microsphere, e.g.,
microsphere 30, having the same bioactive agent A encapsulated within each of the microspheres
30, 32, 34. Unlike multiple release profiles of distinct bioactive agents A, B, C, encapsulating a
single bioactive agent A provides a burst-like release profile, namely, increased dosages of the
bioactive agent A are supplied as each of the microspheres 30, 32, 34 degrades. In addition,
multiple layers provide an effective method to further slow-down in the release rate of the
bioactive agent.
[00426] Multi-encapsulated microspheres provide unique advantages over conventional
microspheres that encapsulate one or more bioactive agents in a single biodegradable
microsphere. Encapsulating multiple bioactive agents in a single-layered microsphere
formulation simply provides for simultaneous release of multiple bioactive agents, rather than for
a staggered release profile as illustrated in Fig. 4. With respect to a single bioactive agent, a
single-layered microsphere formulation is challenging in terms of providing burst and/or
pulsatile release of bioactive agents during its degradation as illustrated in Fig. 5.
[00427] Multi-encapsulated microspheres provide for more effective bioactive agent loading.
In embodiments, when a water-soluble hydrophilic bioactive agent is encapsulated in oxidized
cellulose as the first layer of encapsulation using an oil-in-oil (o/o) emulsion solvent-evaporation
method, the water-soluble hydrophilic bioactive agent is not lost in the oil-rich, hydrophobic
                                                   82

surroundings and can therefore be effectively encapsulated in oxidized cellulose. During the
second round of microencapsulation, e.g., with an oil in water o/w method, the water-soluble
hydrophilic bioactive agent already has a protective layer, which again results in lower bioactive
agent loss to the aqueous media, resulting in higher bioactive agent loading, following double
encapsulation. The advantage of more effective bioactive agent loading is useful for
encapsulating highly hydrophilic bioactive agent molecules. This is challenging to achieve with
more conventional methods that employ single-layered encapsulation or those that employ
polymers other than oxidized cellulose.
[00428] Multi-encapsulated microspheres further provide for additional protection of fragile,
i.e. more vulnerable to environmental conditions, bioactive agents (e.g. biologics or protein
therapeutics).   Multi-encapsulation offers a significant advantage in controlling their release
while keeping them active and protected from denaturation. This is possible for example when a
first layer of encapsulation is put in place with oxidized cellulose, thus providing a protective
barrier against any harsh conditions in the second (or subsequent) rounds of microencapsulation.
This advantage opens up the possibility of effective encapsulation and controlled release of some
very fragile biological therapeutics (e.g. protein therapeutics).
[00429]     With respect to Fig. 2, multi-encapsulation also offers the ability for simultaneous
release of multiple bioactive agents. Bioactive agents A, B, and C may be encapsulated
individually in the microspheres 22, which are then encapsulated in the microsphere 20. This
allows the bioactive agents A, B, and C to release simultaneously, while at the same time
ensuring that these molecules do not interact with each other prior to release. Further, an outer
encapsulation may be free of any bioactive agents and may act as a buffer, preventing release of
bioactive agents until the outer encapsulation has biodegraded. Thus, multi-layered
                                                   83

encapsulation using oxidized cellulose can facilitate more control over the timing release of the
therapeutic payload.
[00430]    Microspheres (e.g., single or multi-encapsulated microspheres) according to the present
disclosure may also incorporate one or more visualization agents in presence or absence of the
bioactive agents. Visualization agents may be encapsulated into single or multi-encapsulated
microspheres using the methods and techniques described above with respect to bioactive agents.
Suitable visualization agents may be selected from among any of the various non-toxic colored
dyes suitable for use in tissue, such as FD&C Blue #1, FD&C Blue #2, FD&C Blue #3, D&C
Green #6, methylene blue, indocyanine green, combinations thereof, and the like. In
embodiments, additional visualization agents may be used, agents which are green or yellow
fluorescent under visible light (e.g., fluorescein or eosin), x-ray contrast agents (e.g., iodinated
compounds), ultrasonic contrast agents, MRI contrast agents (e.g., gadolinium containing
compounds), CAT or CT scan contract agents (e.g., barium, barium sulphate, iodine, diatrizoic
acid, available as GASTROGRAFIN@, etc.), radionucleotides (e.g., isotopes of technetium,
iodine, indium, fluorine), combinations thereof, and the like. In further embodiments, the
visualization agents may be magnetic materials suitable for tagging various compounds (e.g.,
cancer proteins) during assays. Suitable magnetic materials are described in further detail below.
[00431]    With reference to Fig. 2, the microsphere 20 includes a shell encapsulating one or more
smaller microspheres 22 therein. The microsphere 20 may include a first visualization agent
while the microsphere 22 may include a second visualization agent, respectively, incorporated
thereinto. The first and second visualization agents may be the same or different. In
embodiments, the first and second visualization agents are different such that as the microspheres
20 are degraded after implantation, the first visualization agent is initially dispersed through the
                                                   84

tissue in which the microsphere 20 is introduced, followed by the release of the second
visualization agent due to the degradation of the microspheres 22. Sequential release of the first
and second visualization agents occurs due to the degradation of the microsphere 20 prior to the
degradation of the microsphere 22.
[00432] In addition to the first and second visualization agents, the microsphere 20 and the
microspheres 22 may include first and second bioactive agents. The combination of the first and
second visualization and first and second bioactive agents allows the healthcare professional to
visualize/monitor progression, such as, track release rate, release sequence absorption, and other
properties of the first and second bioactive agents. Further, this also allows for the monitoring of
patient progress and the effectiveness of the bioactive agents.
[00433] With reference to Fig. 6, another embodiment a multi-encapsulating microsphere 40 is
shown. The microsphere 40 includes a shell encapsulating one or more smaller first
microspheres 42 and one or more smaller second microspheres 44. The first and second
microspheres 42 include first and second visualization agents and first and second bioactive
agents, respectively. The first and second microspheres 42 and 44 may be formed separately
prior to encapsulation within the microsphere 40. In embodiments, the microsphere 40 may
include third visualization agent and third bioactive agent. Since the first and second
microspheres 42 and 44 are encapsulated in the microsphere 40, the microspheres 42 and 44
begin to degrade concurrently. This allows for evaluation of the progress of the release of the
first and second bioactive agents, by measuring the ratio of the first visualization agent to the
second visualization agent. In embodiments, the microspheres 42 may include a first
visualization agent and a first bioactive agent, while the microspheres 44 may include a second
visualization agent and a second bioactive agent. Thus, the release of the first visualization agent
                                                  85

corresponds to the release of the first bioactive agent and the release of the second visualization
agent corresponds to the release of the second bioactive agent. In embodiments, the
microspheres 42 and 44 may be prepared from the same or different materials to tailor absorption
rate of the first and second visualization and/or bioactive agents.
[00434] In other embodiments, with reference to Fig. 3, a doubly-encapsulating microsphere 30
includes a microsphere 32, which further encapsulates microsphere 34 as described in more
detail above. In one embodiment, the microsphere 30 and the microsphere 34 may include first
and second bioactive agents, respectively. The microsphere 32 includes a first visualization
agent. In this configuration, the first visualization may be used as a demarcation marker to
indicate when the first bioactive agent of microsphere 30 has been released completely or
mostly, prior to the release of the second bioactive agent from microsphere 34. Sequential
release of the first and second bioactive agents occurs due to the degradation of the microsphere
30 prior to the degradation of the microsphere 32, followed by the degradation of the
microsphere 34.
[00435] Microspheres (e.g., single or multi-encapsulated microspheres) according to the present
disclosure may also incorporate one or more precursors (e.g., hydrogel or adhesive precursors)
for forming compositions (e.g., hydrogels or adhesives) in situ. The hydrogel precursors may be
in the presence or absence of the bioactive agents as described above. Hydrogel precursors may
be encapsulated into single or multi-encapsulated microspheres using the methods and
techniques described above with respect to bioactive agents. With reference to Fig. 7, a multi
encapsulating microsphere 70 is shown, having one or more first microspheres 72 including a
first hydrogel precursor and one or more second microspheres 74 including a second hydrogel
precursor. After implantation, the microsphere 70 prevents immediate polymerization or
                                                   86

reaction of the first and second hydrogel precursors. After degradation of the microsphere 70,
the microspheres 72 and 74 degrade, thereby releasing the first and second hydrogel precursors,
which then react to form a hydrogel 78. In embodiments, the microsphere 70 may also include
one or more initiators. Encapsulation of the first and second precursors allows for formation of a
gel that is needed after a predetermined period of time, rather than immediately after introduction
in vivo. The timing of the polymerization and/or activation may be controlled by adjusting the
loading of the first and second precursors and/or the thickness of the microspheres, as well as
other formulation characteristics.
[00436] With reference to Fig. 8, a first multi-encapsulating microsphere 80 is shown, having
one or more first microspheres 82 including a first hydrogel precursor and a second multi
encapsulating microsphere 86 including a third microsphere 84 having a second hydrogel
precursor. After implantation, the microsphere 80 prevents immediate polymerization of the first
and second hydrogel precursors. After degradation of the microsphere 80, the first microspheres
82 degrade, thereby releasing the first hydrogel precursors. The second multi-encapsulating
microsphere 86 degrades concurrently with the first microspheres 82, delaying the release of the
second hydrogel precursor contained within the second microspheres 84. In embodiments, the
microspheres 80 and/or 86 may also include one or more initiators. This configuration delays the
release of the second precursor, which also delays cross-linking of the precursors to form a
hydrogel 88, which occurs only after the microspheres 84 have also degraded.
[00437]    The above-described hydrogels may be formed from crosslinking the first and second
precursors. The precursor may be a monomer or a macromer. As used herein the terms
"hydrogel precursor(s)", "first hydrogel precursor", and "second hydrogel precursor" may be
used to refer to components that may be combined to form a hydrogel, either with or without the
                                                 87

use of an initiator. Thus, these precursors may, in embodiments, include combinations of reactive
precursors and initiated precursors. As used herein the terms "reactive precursor(s)", "first
reactive hydrogel precursor(s)", and "second reactive hydrogel precursor(s)" include precursors
that may crosslink upon exposure to each other to form a hydrogel. As used herein the term
"initiated precursor(s)", "first initiated hydrogel precursor(s)" and "second initiated hydrogel
precursor(s)" may be used to describe first and second precursors that crosslink upon exposure to
an external source, sometimes referred to herein as an "initiator". Initiators include, for example,
ions, UV light, redox-reaction components, combinations thereof, as well as other initiators
within the purview of those skilled in the art.
[00438] The first and second precursors, whether reactive precursors or initiated precursors,
may have biologically inert and water soluble cores. When the core is a polymeric region that is
water soluble, suitable polymers that may be used include: polyethers, for example, polyalkylene
oxides such as polyethylene glycol ("PEG"), polyethylene oxide ("PEO"), polyethylene oxide
co-polypropylene oxide ("PPO"), co-polyethylene oxide block or random copolymers, and
polyvinyl alcohol ("PVA"), poly(vinyl pyrrolidinone) ("PVP"), poly(amino acids), poly
(saccharides), such as dextran, chitosan, alginates, carboxymethylcellulose, oxidized cellulose,
hydroxyethylcellulose and/or hydroxymethylcellulose, hyaluronic acid, and proteins such as
albumin, collagen, casein, and gelatin. In embodiments, combinations of the foregoing
polymeric materials may be utilized to form a core. The polyethers, and more particularly
poly(oxyalkylenes) or poly(ethylene glycol) or polyethylene glycol ("PEG"), may be utilized in
some embodiments.
[00439]    When the core is small in molecular nature, any of a variety of hydrophilic
functionalities may be used to make the first and second precursors water soluble. In
                                                   88

embodiments, functional groups like hydroxyl, amine, sulfonate and carboxylate, may contribute
to the water-solubility of a precursor. For example, the N-hydroxysuccinimide ("NHS") ester of
subaric acid is insoluble in water, but by adding a sulfonate group to the succinimide ring, the
NHS ester of subaric acid may be made water soluble, without affecting its ability to be used as a
reactive group due to its reactivity towards amine groups.
[00440] In embodiments, a hydrogel may be formed from reactive precursors through covalent,
ionic, or hydrophobic bonds. Physical (non-covalent) crosslinks may result from complexation,
hydrogen bonding, desolvation, Van der Waals interactions, ionic bonding, combinations
thereof, and the like, and may be initiated by mixing two precursors that are physically separated
until combined in situ or as a consequence of a prevalent condition in the physiological
environment, including temperature, pH, ionic strength, combinations thereof, and the like.
Chemical (covalent) crosslinking may be accomplished by any of a number of mechanisms
including, but not limited to, free radical polymerization, condensation polymerization, anionic
or cationic polymerization, step growth polymerization, electrophile-nucleophile reactions,
combinations thereof, and the like.
[00441] In embodiments, the reactive precursor portion of the hydrogel may be formed from a
single type of reactive precursor or multiple types of reactive precursors. In other embodiments,
where the hydrogel is formed from multiple types of reactive precursors, for example two
reactive precursors, the reactive precursors may be referred to as a first and second reactive
precursor. Where more than one reactive precursor is utilized, in embodiments, at least one of
the first and second precursors may be a crosslinker, and at least one other reactive hydrogel
precursor may be a macromolecule, and may be referred to herein as a "functional polymer".
                                                 89

[00442] In some embodiments, reactive precursors may include biocompatible multi-precursor
systems that spontaneously crosslink when the precursors are mixed, but wherein the two or
more precursors are individually stable for the duration of the deposition process. When the
reactive precursors are mixed in an environment that permits reaction (e.g., as relating to pH or
solvent), the functional groups react with each other to form covalent bonds. Reactive precursors
become crosslinked when at least some of the reactive precursors can react with more than one
other precursor. For instance, a precursor with two functional groups of a first type may be
reacted with a crosslinking precursor that has at least three functional groups of a second type
capable of reacting with the first type of functional groups.
[00443]    Such reactive components include, for example, first reactive precursors possessing
electrophilic groups and second reactive precursors possessing nucleophilic groups.
Electrophiles react with nucleophiles to form covalent bonds. Covalent crosslinks or bonds refer
to chemical groups formed by reaction of functional groups on different polymers that serve to
covalently bind the different polymers to each other. In certain embodiments, a first set of
electrophilic functional groups on a first reactive precursor may react with a second set of
nucleophilic functional groups on a second reactive precursor. In embodiments, such systems
include a first reactive precursor including di- or multifunctional alkylene oxide containing
moieties, and a second reactive precursor including macromers that are di- or multifunctional
amines.
[00444]    In embodiments the first and second precursors may be multifunctional, meaning that
they may include two or more electrophilic or nucleophilic functional groups, such that, for
example, an electrophilic functional group on the first reactive hydrogel precursor may react with
a nucleophilic functional group on the second reactive hydrogel precursor to form a covalent
                                                  90

bond. At least one of the first or second precursors includes more than two functional groups, so
that, as a result of electrophilic-nucleophilic reactions, the precursors combine to form
crosslinked polymeric products.
[00445] In embodiments, each of the first and second precursors include only one category of
functional groups, either only nucleophilic groups or only electrophilic functional groups, so
long as both nucleophilic and electrophilic reactive precursors are used in the crosslinking
reaction. Thus, for example, if the first reactive hydrogel precursor has electrophilic functional
groups such as N-hydroxysuccinimides, the second reactive hydrogel precursor may have
nucleophilic functional groups such as amines. On the other hand, if the first reactive hydrogel
precursor has electrophilic functional groups such as sulfosuccinimides, then the second reactive
hydrogel precursor may have nucleophilic functional groups such as amines or thiols.
[00446] In embodiments, a multifunctional electrophilic polymer such as a multi-arm PEG
functionalized with multiple NHS groups may be used as a first reactive hydrogel precursor and
a multifunctional nucleophilic polymer such as trilysine may be used as a second reactive
hydrogel precursor. The multi-arm PEG functionalized with multiple NHS groups may, for
example, have four, six or eight arms and a molecular weight of from about 5,000 to about
25,000. Other examples of suitable first and second precursors are described in U.S. Patent Nos.
6,152,943, 6,165,201, 6,179,862, 6,514,534, 6,566,406, 6,605,294, 6,673,093, 6,703,047,
6,818,018, 7,009,034, and 7,347,850, the entire disclosures of each of which are incorporated by
reference herein.
[00447] Synthetic materials that are readily sterilized and avoid the dangers of disease
transmission that may accompany the use of natural materials may thus be used. Indeed, certain
polymerizable hydrogels made using synthetic precursors are within the purview of those skilled
                                                   91

in the art, e.g., as used in commercially available products such as FOCALSEAL* (Genzyme,
Inc.), COSEAL* (Angiotech Pharmaceuticals), and DURASEAL* (Confluent Surgical, Inc).
Other known hydrogels include, for example, those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,656,200,
5,874,500, 5,543,441, 5,514,379, 5,410,016, 5,162,430, 5,324,775, 5,752,974, and 5,550,187.
[00448] The reaction conditions for forming crosslinked polymeric hydrogels from first and
second precursors may depend on the nature of the reactive precursor used as well as the
surrounding environment. The first and second precursors may be stable and/or non-reactive at
a given pH as they are encased within oxidized cellulose and/or another biodegradable polymer,
but become reactive upon exposure the pH of the tissue pH. In embodiments, reactions may be
conducted in buffered aqueous solutions at a pH of about 5 to about 12. Buffers include, for
example, sodium borate buffer (pH 10) and triethanol amine buffer (pH 7). In some
embodiments, organic solvents such as ethanol or isopropanol may be added to improve the
reaction speed of the first and second precursors.
[00449]     In embodiments, the multi-encapsulated microspheres may incorporate any other in
situ polymerizable monomers suitable for forming biocompatible tissue implants, hydrogels
and/or adhesives, such as a-cyanoacrylate monomers, 1,1 -disubstituted ethylene monomers,
combinations thereof, and the like.
[00450]     Microspheres (e.g., single or multi-encapsulated microspheres) according to the present
disclosure may also incorporate one or more magnetic materials allowing for guidance of the
encapsulated microspheres through a patient's body. Magnetic materials may be encapsulated
into single or multi-encapsulated microspheres using the methods and techniques described
above with respect to bioactive agents. Multi-encapsulated microspheres may include magnetic
materials encapsulated therein along with bioactive agents, visualization agents, cross-linking
                                                  92

precursors, radioactive materials, and combinations thereof, as discussed in more detail below
with respect to Figs. 2, 3, 6, and 9. Multi-encapsulated microspheres permit sequestration of
magnetic materials from other substances (e.g., bioactive agents, visualization agents, etc.)
contained in the microspheres, thereby allowing for magnetic guidance of the microspheres to
the tissue site of interest as described in further detail below.
[00451] Multi-encapsulated microspheres may be guided to a treatment site by injecting or
otherwise delivering the microspheres into the patient (e.g., intravenously, orally, etc.). After
delivery of the microspheres, the treatment site is subjected to one or more magnetic fields,
which may be generated by any suitable permanent or temporary magnets (e.g., electromagnets).
The magnetic fields retain the microspheres circulating through the patient within the treatment
site, i.e., the area to which magnetic field is applied. The microspheres thereafter begin to
biodegrade, delivering the materials encapsulated therein to the treatment site. Magnetic
guidance allows for the concentration of bioactive agents at a predetermined target site, and
away from other sites of the patient within healthy tissue.
[00452] Magnetic guidance provides for delivery of microspheres to specific locations in the
body which are hard to reach using conventional delivery mechanisms (e.g., catheters). Magnetic
guidance is possible with more than one layer of encapsulation containing a magnetic payload,
thus allowing for more than one occasion of magnetic guidance as the layers erode and/or
diffuse. The use of oxidized cellulose also lowers the possibility of rusting of the magnetic
payload (e.g., iron containing payload) since the process of encapsulation in oxidized cellulose is
an oil-in-oil process, i.e., a non-aqueous process. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may also
be facilitated with the magnetic materials. Complementary properties of more than one MRI
                                                    93

agent could be combined in the same formulation because of the multiple layers of
encapsulation.
[00453] With reference to Fig. 2, the multi-encapsulating microsphere 20 encapsulates a
plurality of microspheres 22 therein. The microspheres 22 include one or more bioactive agents,
visualization agents, and/or cross-linking precursors described above. The multi-encapsulating
microsphere 20 further includes one or more magnetic materials.
[00454] With reference to Fig. 3, a doubly-encapsulating microsphere 30 includes a
microsphere 32, which further encapsulates microsphere 34 as described in more detail above.
In one embodiment, the microsphere 30 may include a first bioactive agent, visualization agent,
and/or cross-linking precursor described above. The microsphere 32 includes a second bioactive
agent, visualization agent, and/or cross-linking precursor. The microsphere 34 includes one or
more magnetic materials. Encapsulation of the magnetic materials in the furthest encapsulated
microsphere 34, allows for the magnetic materials to remain at the treatment site while doubly
encapsulating microsphere 30 degrades thereby releasing the first bioactive agent, visualization
agent, and/or cross-linking precursor followed by the degradation of the single-encapsulating
microsphere 34 thereby releasing the second bioactive agent, visualization agent, and/or cross
linking precursor.
[00455] With reference to Fig. 6, multi-encapsulating microsphere 40 is shown. The
microsphere 40 includes one or more first microspheres 42 and one or more second microspheres
44. The first microspheres 42 may possess one or more bioactive agents, visualization agents,
and/or cross-linking precursors described above.and the second microspheres 44 include one or
more magnetic materials. Microspheres 42 and 44 may be encapsulated in the same layer or in
multiple layers, which may be the same or different.
                                                 94

[00456]   In embodiments, the microsphere 44 may also include magnetic materials, which
allows for multiple opportunities of magnetic guidance. In particular, the microspheres 40 may
be guided to a first treatment site, where the microsphere 40 degrades, thereby releasing the
microspheres 42 and 44. The microspheres 42 remain in place, thereby releasing payload, while
the microspheres 44, which include magnetic materials may be guided to a second treatment site.
The microspheres 44 may optionally include a second bioactive agent, visualization agent, and/or
cross-linking precursor described above. Once at the second treatment site, the microspheres 44
degrade thereby releasing its own payload.
[00457]   With reference to Fig. 9, another embodiment a multi-encapsulating microsphere 50 is
shown. The microsphere 50 includes one or more first microspheres 52, one or more second
microspheres 54, and one or more third microspheres 56. The first microspheres 52 may include
one or more bioactive agents, the second microspheres 54 may include one or more magnetic
materials, and the third microspheres 56 may include a visualization agent, or any other suitable
material. The first microsphere 52, second microsphere 54, and third microsphere 56 may be
formed separately prior to encapsulation within the microsphere 50. Microspheres 52, 54, 56
may be encapsulated in the same layer or in multiple layers, which may be the same or different.
[00458]   Where utilized, suitable magnetic materials may be in particle form having a size from
about 10 angstroms (A) to about 1000 A, in embodiments from about 25 A to about 500 A.
Suitable magnetic materials may be temporary magnetic materials or permanent magnetic
materials, ceramic, crystalline, or flexible magnetic materials (e.g., a polymeric substance such
as thermoplastics or rubber) combined with magnetic ferrite (e.g., heat-treated mixtures of oxides
of iron and one or more other metals having complex crystals with magnetic properties).
Suitable magnetic materials include, but are not limited to, ferrite, strontium ferrous oxide,
                                                  95

neodymium (NdFeB, optionally including dysprosium), samarium, cobalt, aluminum, nickel,
copper, iron, titanium, and combinations thereof. In embodiments, the microspheres 22 may
include magnetotactic bacteria having magnetosomes allowing the bacteria to orient within a
magnetic field. In further embodiments, the magnetic material may be an alloy of a radioactive
material such as yttrium-90, which is a P-emitter, making it suitable for radiation therapy
treatment of various cancers as described in further detail below.
[00459]   Microspheres (e.g., single or multi-encapsulated microspheres) according to the present
disclosure may also incorporate one or more radioactive materials allowing the microspheres to
be used in interventional oncology (e.g., radiotherapy). Radioactive materials may be
encapsulated into single or multi-encapsulated microspheres using the methods and techniques
described above with respect to bioactive agents. Suitable radioactive materials include, but are
not limited to, yttrium (e.g., 90Y), iodine (e.g.,                      166
                                                   311), holmium (e.g.,    Ho), combinations thereof,
and the like. Microspheres containing radioactive materials may be formed by encapsulating the
materials as described above. In embodiments, radioactive materials may be encapsulated in
oxidized cellulose to form singly-encapsulated microspheres. In embodiments, the oxidized
cellulose microspheres including radioactive materials may be further encapsulated in successive
oxidized cellulose microspheres.
[00460]   Once microspheres are formed, they are subjected to neutron bombardment prior to
implantation within the patient to convert stable isotopes of the materials into radioactive
materials suitable for radiotherapy (e.g., converting inert '9Y into 90Y). The microspheres may
be guided to the treatment site using any suitable methods (e.g., magnetic guidance as described
above if magnetic materials are present). The microspheres may then deliver radiation therapy to
the treatment site.
                                                   96

[00461] Neutron bombardment and/or other treatments may heat the microspheres up to 200
'C, which causes degradation of many biodegradable polymers used to create microspheres, such
as polylactide. Accordingly, conventional microspheres for delivering radioactive materials have
been formed from non-biodegradable materials, such as glass. The present disclosure provides
for single or multi-encapsulated microspheres formed from oxidized cellulose, which is a
polymer capable of withstanding temperatures up to 200 'C. Unlike glass microspheres, the
microspheres of the present disclosure provide for delivery of the radioactive materials using
biodegradable microspheres that degrade over time. Glass microspheres including radioactive
materials are disclosed in S. Ho et al., "Clinical Evaluation Of The Partition Model For
Estimating Radiation Doses From Yttrium-90 Microspheres In The Treatment Of Hepatic
Cancer Evaluation Of The Partition Model For Estimating Radiation Doses From Yttrium-90
Micro Spheres In The Treatment Of Hepatic Cancer," European Journal of Nuclear Medicine,
Vol. 24, No. 3, (March 1997), pp. 293-298.
[00462]    Microspheres made with oxidized cellulose are lower in density than glass
microspheres, which is an advantage for interventional oncology applications because high
density microspheres result in intravascular settling. With respect to conventional encapsulation
materials, multiple encapsulation of radioactive materials using oxidized cellulose as described
herein prevents seepage and leakage of radioactive materials from the microspheres.
[00463]    Microspheres (e.g., single or multi-encapsulated microspheres) according to the present
disclosure may also incorporate one or more endothermic or exothermic agents. Endothermic or
exothermic agents may be encapsulated into single or multi-encapsulated microspheres using the
methods and techniques described above with respect to bioactive agents. Endothermic and/or
exothermic agents may be used in treatments where exothermic and endothermic reactions (e.g.,
                                                   97

oncology) are desired, especially in an in situ setting, where the timing and anatomical location
of such heat-producing or heat-absorbing reactions can be controlled and manipulated to heat
and/or cool tissue, respectively. Multi-encapsulated microspheres allow for control over timing
and anatomical location of endothermic and/or exothermic reactions. In other words, the use of
the multi-encapsulated oxidized cellulose formulations allows control over the use of heat
produce or heat-removing reactions, as the reactants are compartmentalized. The actual
production or removal of heat occurs only upon a breakdown of the encapsulating polymer, thus
bringing the reactive components into contact as described in further detail below.
[00464]    Exothermic agents include a first exothermic reactant and a second exothermic
reactant. When the first and second reactants react heat is generated by the reaction into the
surrounding tissue. Suitable first and second exothermic reactants include, but are not limited to,
acids, salts, water, calcium oxide, and combinations thereof.
[00465]    Endothermic agents include a first endothermic reactant and a second endothermic
reactant. When the first and second reactants react heat is withdrawn by the reaction from the
surrounding tissue. Suitable first and second endothermic reactants include, but are not limited
to, ethanoic acid, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, and combinations thereof.
[00466]    Endothermic or exothermic reactants may be combined to produce an endothermic
reaction, an exothermic reaction, or both, respectively. Suitable medical conditions for treatment
with these endothermic and/or exothermic reactions include, for example, cancers (e.g., tumors),
inflammation, infections, combinations, thereof, and the like. The use of oxidized cellulose for
multiple-encapsulation of hydrophilic endothermic and/or exothermic reactants.
[00467]    In embodiments, tumors may be treated by application of heat, which destroys cancer
cells. There are two modes of heat application for cancer treatment: hyperthermia and
                                                  98

thermoablation. Hyperthermia involves heating of certain organs or tissues to temperatures from
about 41 'C to about 48 'C. Thermoablation generally involves heating tissues to temperatures
from about 48 'C to about 56 'C. Thermoablation is characterized by acute necrosis, coagulation,
and/or carbonization of the tumor tissue due to the relatively higher temperatures involved. Heat
is conventionally delivered by electrosurgical energy, resistive heating, microwave energy,
heated fluid, combinations thereof, and the like. To compensate for the heat supplied to the
tissue (e.g., limit heat application to the tumor) and prevent damage to surrounding healthy
tissue, heat sinks (e.g., circulated coolant) may be supplied to the surrounding tissue and/or the
device (e.g., catheter) being used during ablation.
[00468] In embodiments, the present disclosure provides for in situ delivery of exothermic
and/or endothermic reactants/agents via oxidized cellulose microspheres (e.g., multi
encapsulated formulations) within and outside the tumor, respectively. In embodiments, either
one or both of the exothermic and endothermic agents may be delivered while heating and/or
cooling is supplied or removed by other suitable methods (e.g., energy ablation, coolant
circulation, etc.).
[00469] With reference to Fig. 6, a multi-encapsulating microsphere 40 is shown, having one or
more first microspheres 42 including a first endothermic or exothermic reactant and one or more
second microspheres 44 including a second endothermic or exothermic reactant. After
implantation, the microspheres 40, 42, and 44 prevent immediate reaction of the first and second
endothermic or exothermic reactants. After degradation of the microsphere 40, the microspheres
42 and 44 subsequently degrade, thereby releasing the first and second endothermic or
exothermic reactants, which then react in exothermic or endothermic fashion to heat or cool
                                                   99

tissue as described above. In embodiments, the microsphere 40 may also include one or more
initiators.
[00470] With reference to Fig. 10, the microspheres 40 possessing microspheres 42 and 44 are
implanted within and/or around the tissue region (e.g., tumor T). In embodiments, exothermic
microspheres 92, for example, microspheres 40 possessing microspheres 42 and 44 including
first and second exothermic reactants, respectively, are implanted within the tumor boundary of
the tumor T. Endothermic microspheres 90, namely, microspheres 40 possessing microspheres
42 and 44 including first and second endothermic reactants, respectively, are implanted on the
periphery of the tumor T with cooling of the surrounding tissue. This allows for enhanced
heating within the tumor boundary and active cooling outside the tumor boundary.
[00471] In embodiments, in situ exothermic and endothermic reactions may be timed along
with initiation of thermal ablation in the tumor, such that the exothermic reaction within the
tumor enhances the effect of the thermal ablation, while the endothermic reaction outside the
tumor protects the healthy tissue. In further embodiments, heating may be accomplished using
conventional hyperthermia or ablation devices, with microspheres 40, 42, and 44 being used to
deliver endothermic reactants around the tissue to cool tissue. In further embodiments, cooling
may be accomplished using conventional cooling techniques, with microspheres 40 being used to
deliver exothermic reactants into the tissue to heat tissue.
[00472] Microspheres (e.g., single or multi-encapsulated microspheres) according to the present
disclosure may also incorporate one or more magnetic materials allowing for guidance of the
encapsulated microspheres containing endothermic and/or exothermic reactants through a
patient's body. Multi-encapsulated microspheres may be guided to a treatment site by injecting
or otherwise delivering the microspheres into the patient (e.g., intravenously, orally, etc.). After
                                                 100

delivery of the microspheres, the treatment site is subjected to one or more magnetic fields,
which may be generated by any suitable permanent or temporary magnets (e.g., electromagnets).
The magnetic fields retain the microspheres circulating through the patient within the treatment
site, i.e., the area to which magnetic field is applied. The microspheres thereafter begin to
biodegrade, delivering the materials encapsulated therein to the treatment site. Magnetic
guidance allows for the concentration of endothermic or exothermic agents at a predetermined
target site, and away from other sites of the patient (e.g., reticular endothelial system).
[00473] It should be appreciated that the above-described embodiments of the multi
encapsulated microspheres are merely illustrative and various additional combinations of multi
encapsulated microspheres, bioactive agents, visualization agents, cross-linking precursors,
magnetic materials, radioactive materials, and the like may be used in combination and/or
interchangeably therewith.
[00474] The following Examples are being submitted to illustrate embodiments of the present
disclosure. These Examples are intended to be illustrative only and are not intended to limit the
scope of the present disclosure. Also, parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise
indicated. As used herein, "room temperature" or "ambient temperature" refers to a temperature
from about 20 0 C to about 250 C.

COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1
[00475]    Incomplete Dissolution of oxidized cellulose having a degree of oxidation of 0.6 in a
solution including 8% by weight lithium chloride (LiCl) and N-methyl-2-N,N
Dimethylacetamide (DMAc).
[00476] About 1.6 grams (g) of LiCl was first dissolved in about 20 milliliters (mL) DMAc to
form an 8% LiCl in DMAc solution. About 20 milliliters (mL) of the 8% LiCl in DMAc
solution was added to a reactor vessel, and was heated to about 160' C under argon. About 149
milligrams (mg) of oxidized cellulose having a degree of oxidation of 0.6 was added to the
reactor vessel. The mixture was heated for about 1.17 hours, cooled to ambient temperature, and
discharged from the reactor vessel. The sample did not fully dissolve, and was observed to
discolor significantly, indicating that further oxidation of the oxidized cellulose had occurred.

[00478] About 20 mL of the 8% LiCl in DMAc solution produced above in Comparative
Example 1 and about 90 mg of oxidized cellulose having a degree of oxidation of 0.6 were added
to a reactor vessel. The mixture was heated to about 150' C under argon for about 5.3 hours,
cooled to ambient temperature, and discharged from the reactor vessel. The sample did not fully
dissolve, and was observed to discolor significantly, indicating further oxidation of the oxidized
cellulose occurred.

COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3
[00479]    Pretreatment of oxidized cellulose having a degree of oxidation of 0.6 in water.
[00480] About 22 mg of oxidized cellulose having a degree of oxidation of 0.6 was placed in a
reactor vessel and about 0.66 grams of deionized water was added thereto. The mixture was
stirred for a period of time from about 2 minutes to about 3 minutes. The water was then
removed in a vacuum, and about 20 mL of the 8% LiCl in DMAc solution from Comparative
Example 1 was added to a reactor vessel. The mixture was heated to about 155' C for about 4.6
hours. It was then cooled to ambient temperature, and discharged from the reactor vessel. The
sample did not fully dissolve. Thus, pretreatment of the oxidized cellulose in water had no
discernable effect on dissolution.
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4
[00481]    Dissolution of cellulose in a solution including 1% by weight of LiCl in N-methyl-2
pyrrolidinone (NMP) under inert atmosphere.
[00482] About 20 mL of the NMP and approximately 80 mg of non-modified cellulose were
added to a reactor vessel. The mixture was heated to about 150'C under argon for about 6 hours
and then cooled to about 1 10 C after which approximately 0.2g of LiCl was added to the reactor
vessel. The reactor vessel was maintained at about 1 10 C for an additional hour before being
cooled to about 80'C. The reactor vessel was maintained at about 80'C for about 14.5 hours after
which it was observed that the sample had not dissolved and that pieces of non-modified
cellulose were observed in the reactor vessel indicating that 1% LiCl NMP solution did not
completely dissolve cellulose.

EXAMPLE 1
[00483] Dissolution of oxidized cellulose having a degree of oxidation of 0.6 in a solution
including 1% by weight of LiCl in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP).
[00484] A 100 mL three-neck round-bottom flask was used as a reactor vessel and was fitted
with a gas inlet, a mechanical stirrer, and a gas outlet, which was then connected to a flow rate
monitor. The flask was purged with argon for about 5 minutes at a rate of approximately 0.4 liter
per minute (L/min), which was measured as approximately 5 bubbles per second by the flow rate
monitor.
[00485] About 20 mL of anhydrous NMP was pipetted into the flask, which was then again
purged with argon. Argon flow was adjusted to a rate of approximately 0.2 L/min or from about
2 bubbles per second to about 3 bubbles per second, as observed on the flow rate monitor.
[00486] A helium line was attached to the flask and the argon flow was stopped. The helium
line was inserted into the reactor and submerged below the liquid level, and the helium flow was
set at approximately 0.2 L/min to sparge the NMP. After about 45 minutes of sparging, the
helium line was removed and the argon flow was reinitiated at a rate of about 0.2 L/min.
[00487] About 80 mg of oxidized cellulose having a degree of oxidation of 0.6 was cut into
approximately 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm square pieces. Argon flow was temporarily increased to about
0.4 L/min and the oxidized cellulose was added to the flask, after which the argon flow was
restored to about 0.2 L/min.
[00488]    The mixture was stirred at about 200 revolutions per minute (rpm). The flask was
heated from about 1300 C to about 135' C using a temperature-controlled heating mantle. The
                                                  104

temperature was maintained for about 2 hours under argon as the mixture was stirred.
Thereafter, the mixture was cooled to a temperature from about 1000 C to about 1100 C.
[00489] A scintillation vial was purged with argon in preparation for addition of LiCl. About
0.2 grams of anhydrous LiCl was weighed in the vial. Stirring was temporarily suspended and
argon flow was increased to about 0.4 L/min while the LiCl was added to the reactor vessel.
After addition of the LiCl, the argon flow was restored to about 0.2 L/min. Stirring was resumed
at about 450 rpm for about 5 minutes and then reduced to about 200 rpm.
[00490]    Temperature was maintained from about 1000 C to about 1100 C. The mixture was
visually inspected approximately 5 minutes after addition of the LiCl and about every 15 minutes
thereafter to determine whether oxidized cellulose was dissolved. The oxidized cellulose was
observed to have undergone complete dissolution. Heating was terminated and the solution was
cooled to ambient temperature and stirred at about 200 rpm. The solution was then transferred
into a scintillation vial under argon and sealed. The solution was stored at ambient conditions.

[00491]    Dissolution of oxidized cellulose having a degree of oxidation of 0.6 in a solution
including 1% by weight of LiCl in NMP under ambient atmosphere.
[00492]    The same process was followed as set forth in Example 1 above, except the dissolution
was carried out under ambient atmosphere. Oxidized cellulose was observed to have undergone
complete dissolution.

[00493]   Dissolution of oxidized cellulose having a degree of oxidation of 0.6 in a solution
including 1% by weight of LiCl in NMP under ambient atmosphere without helium sparging.
[00494]   The same process was followed as set forth in Example 1 above, except the dissolution
was carried out under ambient atmosphere and without helium sparging. Oxidized cellulose was
observed to have undergone complete dissolution.
[00495]   Molecular weight was determined for the dissolved oxidized cellulose of Examples 1-3
as summarized in Table 1 below.
                                       Example Mn (g/mol)

                                             Table 1
[00496] As illustrated in Table 1, dissolved oxidized cellulose of Example 1 had the highest
molecular weight, whereas the dissolved oxidized cellulose of Examples 2 and 3 had a much
lower molecular weight. Without being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that
conducting dissolution under ambient atmosphere degrades the oxidized cellulose, resulting in
lower molecular weight.
EXAMPLE 4
[00497]   Dissolution of non-modified cellulose in 8% by weight on LiCl in NMP solution.
[00498]   The same process was followed as set forth in Example 1 above, except about 80 mg of
non-modified cellulose was dissolved, the mixture of the non-modified cellulose and the solvent
was heated from about 145' C to about 155' C, and about 1.6 grams of anhydrous LiCl was
added to the mixture to achieve 8% by weight LiCl in NMP solution since 1% LiCl solution was
ineffective as illustrated in Comparative Example 4. Further, after addition of LiCl, the
                                               106

temperature was maintained from about 1000 C to about 110' C for at least one hour. The non
modified cellulose was observed to have undergone complete dissolution.
Preparation of a Mobile Phase of 1% by Weight of LiCl in NMP Solution for Gel Permeation
Chromatography (GPC).
[00499] About 1.5 liters (L) of NMP was added to a 2 L volumetric flask, which was then
loosely capped with a glass stopper. NMP was stirred. About 20 grams of LiCl was added to the
NMP and was stirred for about 60 minutes until it was dissolved. About 0.5 L of NMP was
added to the 2 liter mark and stirring was stopped. Additional NMP was added to the mark and
the solution was mixed by hand-inverting. A 1 micron polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter
membrane was placed in a filtration apparatus and a vacuum was applied, which enabled the
LiCl in NMP solution to flow through the membrane, thereby filtering the solution. The mobile
phase solution was stored at ambient conditions.
Analysis of Dissolved Oxidized Cellulose of Example 1, Non-modified Cellulose of Example 4,
and a Standard Sample.
[00500]    Samples of the dissolved oxidized cellulose of Example 1, the non-modified cellulose
of Example 4, and a pullalan standard sample were separately filtered through a 1 micron PTFE
filter membrane into 3 separate high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) vials. In
addition, a combined sample was also prepared by combining about 500 microliters (piL) of the
dissolved oxidized cellulose of Example 1 and about 500 [iL of the pullalan standard sample (at a
concentration of about 2 mg/mL) in a single HPLC vial.
                                                107

[00501] All of the samples were subjected to GPC analysis performed using a gel permeation
chromatography system with two 300 millimeter (mm) x 7.5 mm columns of Polymer
Laboratories' PLGEL TM in a series configuration. A DAWN@ HELEOS TM 11 multi-angle laser
light scattering system from (Wyatt Technology of Santa Barbara, CA) was used for absolute
molecular weight determination. A refractive index model number OPTILAB@ rEX in
conjunction with the light scattering detector supplied by Wyatt Technology was also used
during molecular weight analysis.
[00502]    GPC was performed at a flow rate of about 1 mL per minute, at a temperature of about
50' C, with an injection volume of about 100 ptL. GPC chromatograms of the oxidized cellulose
of Example 1 and the non-modified cellulose of Example 4 are shown in Figs. 11 and 12,
respectively.
EXAMPLE 5
[00503]    Dissolution of oxidized cellulose having a degree of oxidation of 0.39 in 8% by weight
of LiCl in DMAc solution.
[00504] About 20 mL of DMAc was added to a reactor vessel under argon, followed by
sparging thereof for approximately 10 minutes with helium. About 19 mg of oxidized cellulose
having a degree of oxidation of 0.39 was added to the reactor vessel, which was initially heated
to about 144' C. After addition of the oxidized cellulose, the temperature was increased to about
152' C for approximately 3.2 hours. The reactor vessel was then cooled to about 950 C and
about 1.6 grams of LiCl was added to the mixture to form an 8% LiCl in DMAc solution. The
mixture was then heated to about 950 C for about 45 minutes, then cooled to ambient
temperature. The solution was stirred at ambient temperature for approximately 64 hours, and
                                                 108

discharged from the reactor vessel. The oxidized cellulose was observed to have undergone
complete dissolution.
EXAMPLE 6
[00505] Dissolution of oxidized cellulose having a degree of oxidation of 0.39 in a solution
including 8.8% by weight of LiCl in NMP.
[00506] About 20 mL of NMP was added to the reactor vessel under argon followed by
sparging thereof for approximately 1 hour with helium. About 10.2 mg of oxidized cellulose
having a degree of oxidation of about 0.39 was added to the reactor vessel, which was initially
heated to a temperature from about 1480 C to about 154' C for approximately 2.5 hours. The
reactor vessel was then cooled to about 103' C and about 1.77 grams of LiCl was added to the
mixture to form an 8.8% LiCl in NMP solution. The mixture was then heated to a temperature
from about 103' C to about 105' C for about 1 hour, then cooled to ambient temperature. The
solution was stirred at ambient temperature for approximately 24 hours, and discharged from the
reactor vessel. The oxidized cellulose was observed to have undergone complete dissolution.
EXAMPLE 7
[00507] Dissolution of oxidized cellulose having a degree of oxidation of 0.39 in a solution
including 1% by weight of LiCl in NMP.
[00508] About 20 mL of NMP was added to the reactor vessel under argon followed by
sparging thereof for approximately 1 hour with helium. About 11 mg of oxidized cellulose
having a degree of oxidation of about 0.39 was added to the reactor vessel, which was initially
heated to a temperature from about 1430 C to about 1480 C for approximately 2 hours. The
                                               109

reactor vessel was then cooled to about 1000 C and about 0.20 grams of LiCl was added to the
mixture to form a 1%LiCl in NMP solution. The mixture was then heated to about 930 C for
about 8 minutes, then cooled to ambient temperature. The solution was stirred at ambient
temperature for approximately 24 hours, and discharged from the reactor vessel. The oxidized
cellulose was observed to have undergone complete dissolution.
EXAMPLE 8
[00509] Formation of oxidized cellulose microspheres from an oxidized cellulose solution
including 1%by weight of LiCl in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP).
[00510] A 600 mL glass beaker was set on a ring stand. A constant-torque mixer was fitted with
a medium-shear impeller, which was inserted into the beaker. Approximately 200 mL of heavy
white mineral oil was added to the beaker with the mixer set to rotate at approximately 1,500
rpm. About 1.7 grams of oxidized cellulose solution (about 15% by weight/volume of oxidized
cellulose in NMP) was added drop-wise to the vortex of the stirring mineral oil for about 15
minutes until all of the solution was added to the oil to form an emulsion including a plurality of
oxidized cellulose microspheres.
[00511] About 150 mL of isopropyl myristate was added to the emulsion and the mixer speed
reduced to approximately 900 rpm and maintained for about about 45 minutes. Thereafter,
another 150 mL of isopropyl myristate was added to the emulsion such that isopropyl myristate
was present at a ratio to the oil of about 3:2 and rotations were reduced to approximately 600
rpm.
[00512] The emulsion was stirred from about 2 hours to about 3 hours to extract the NMP from
the oxidized cellulose microspheres. After NMP was extracted, microspheres were collected by
                                                  110

filtration. The microspheres were then washed with a sufficient volume of n-heptane to remove
any trace of processing oils on the surface of the microspheres. The microspheres were dried for
about 24 hours. Collected microspheres were imaged using a Zeiss Leo 435, scanning electron
microscope (SEM), which are shown in Figs. 13A-B at about 100x, and 250x, respectively. The
SEM images show microspheres having a spherical shape and a smooth outer surface.
EXAMPLE 9
[00513]    Formation of 18% by weight (theoretical loading) vitamin B-12 loaded oxidized
cellulose microparticles, from a 150% by weight/volume oxidized cellulose solution including 1%
by weight of LiCl in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP).
[00514] A discontinuous phase was prepared from the oxidized cellulose solution of Example
1. About 3 grams of the oxidized cellulose solution (about 15% by weight/volume of oxidized
cellulose in NMP) was combined with approximately 100 milligrams of cyanocobalmin (vitamin
B-12).
[00515] A 1 liter glass beaker was set on a ring stand. A constant-torque mixer was fitted with a
medium-shear impeller, which was inserted into the beaker. Approximately 300 mL of heavy
white mineral oil was added to the beaker with the mixer set to rotate at approximately 550 rpm.
The solution of cyanocobalmin and oxidized cellulose was then added drop-wise to the vortex of
the stirring mineral oil for about 15 minutes until all of the solution was added to the oil to form
an emulsion.
[00516] About 300 mL of cottonseed oil was added to the emulsion. The emulsion was stirred
at approximately 900 rpm for about 60 minutes. Thereafter, another 300 mL of cottonseed oil
                                                 111

was added to the emulsion. The emulsion was again stirred at approximately 900 rpm for about
60 minutes. About 100 mL of n-heptane was added to the emulsion.
[00517]   The emulsion was stirred for about 60 minutes to extract the NMP from the oxidized
cellulose microparticles.  After NMP was extracted, microparticles were collected by filtration.
The microparticles were then washed with a sufficient volume of n-heptane to remove any trace
of processing oils on the surface of the microparticles. The microparticles were dried for about
24 hours.
[00518]   Collected microparticles were imaged using a Zeiss Leo 435 SEM, which are shown in
Figs. 14A-B at about 500x, and 11 00x, respectively. The SEM images show microparticles
having a textured surface with some microparticles having an elongated, rod-like shape and
others having a sphere-like shape. Without being bound by any particular theory, it is believed
that smooth, spherecal structure of the microparticles is caused by hydrophilic nature of B-12.

[00519]   Formation of 40% by weight (theoretical loading) bupivacaine free base loaded
oxidized cellulose microparticles, from a 15% by weight/volume oxidized cellulose solution
including 1% by weight of LiCl in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP).
[00520]   The same process was followed as set forth in Example 9 above, except about 253.5
milligrams of bupivacaine free base was added to the oxidized cellulose solution.
[00521]   Collected microparticles were imaged using a Zeiss Leo 435 SEM, which are shown in
Figs. 15A-B at about 50x and 250x, respectively. The SEM images show microparticles having
a spherical shape and a textured surface. Without being bound by any particular theory, it is
                                                112

believed that the rougher surface is caused by the wrapping of the crystals of bupivacaine free
base, which is hydrophobic, within the oxidized cellulose microparticles.
EXAMPLE 11
[00522]    Formation of 40% by weight (theoretical loading) bupivacaine HCl loaded oxidized
cellulose microparticles, from a 15% by weight/volume oxidized cellulose solution including 1%

[00523]    The same process was followed as set forth in Example 9 above, except about 250.2
milligrams of bupivacaine HCl was added to the oxidized cellulose solution.
[00524]    Collected microparticles were imaged using a Zeiss Leo 435 SEM, which are shown in
Figs. 16A-B at about 50x and 250x, respectively. The SEM images show microsparticles having
an irregular, crystalline shape and a textured surface. Without being bound by any particular
theory, it is believed that structure of the microparticles is caused by the needle-like crystalline
nature of bupivacaine HCl, which hydrophilic.

oxidized cellulose microspheres, from a 15% by weight/volume oxidized cellulose solution
including 1% by weight of LiCl in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP).
[00526]    The same process was followed as set forth in Example 9 above, except about 200
milligrams of cyanocobalmin (vitamin B-12) was added to the oxidized cellulose solution.
                                                  113

[00527]   Collected microparticles were imaged using a Zeiss Leo 435 SEM, which are shown in
Figs. 18A-B at about 1,000x and 1,700x, respectively. The SEM images show microspheres
having a substantially spherical shape and a smooth outer surface.
[00528] Actual loading of the 30% B-12 loaded microspheres was determined using a
SpectraMax M2, a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Approximately 1 mg of B-12 was dissolved in
about 10 mL of water and scanned from about 200 nm to about 800 nm in order to determine
maximum absorbance. Maximum absorbance was measured at approximately 358 nm. A stock
solution was made with about 10 mg B-12 in 200 mL of water. From this stock solution, serial
dilutions were made and a five (5) point standard calibration curve was constructed as shown in
Fig. 17. About 2.55 mg of the 30% B-12 loaded microspheres was dissolved in 10 mL water,
then further diluted to achieve a ratio of microspheres to water of about 1:2. The diluted solution
was analyzed and measured at an absorbance concentration of approximately 0.679 as shown in
Table 2 below. Actual loading of vitamin B-12 was measured to be about 31%.

[00530]   The same process was followed as set forth in Example 9 above, except about 150
milligrams of vitamin B-12 was added to the oxidized cellulose solution.
[00531]   Collected microparticles were imaged using Keyence VHX-600, a light microscope,
which are shown in Figs. 19A-B at about 600x and 1,000x, respectively. The images show
microspheres having a substantially spherical shape.
EXAMPLE 14
[00532]   Formation of poly-D,L,-lactide (PDLLA) microspheres encapsulating cis
diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) loaded oxidized cellulose microspheres.
[00533] A 1 liter glass beaker was set on a ring stand. A constant-torque mixer was fitted with a
medium-shear impeller, which was inserted into the beaker. Approximately 200 mL of heavy
white mineral oil was added to the beaker with the mixer set to rotate at approximately 1,800
rpm.
[00534] About 300 milligrams of CDDP was added to about 3 grams of the oxidized cellulose
solution having a concentration of about 15 mg/mL, which formed a gel. The gel was vortexed
for about 30 seconds until a uniform consistency was achieved and no particles of CDDP were
visible.
                                               115

[00535]    The gel of CDDP and oxidized cellulose was then added drop-wise to the vortex of the
stirring cottonseed and mineral oils for about 15 minutes at about 1,800 rpm, until all of the
solution was added to the oil to form an emulsion.
[00536] About 200 mL of cottonseed oil were added to the emulsion and the mixing speed was
reduced to about 700 rpm after approximately 1 minute. After about 30 minutes, approximately
200 mL of cottonseed oil was added along with about 50 mL of n-heptane and the emulsion was
mixed for approximately 2.5 hours to extract the NMP from the oxidized cellulose microspheres.
After the NMP was extracted, microspheres were collected under vacuum by filtration through
Whatman No. 4 filter paper. The microspheres were then washed with a sufficient volume of n
heptane to remove any trace of processing oils on the surface of the microspheres.
[00537]    Collected microspheres were imaged using Keyence VHX-600, a light microscope,
which are shown in Fig. 20 at about 1,000x. The light images show microspheres having a
substantially spherical shape and a smooth surface.  The microspheres were of yellow color
showing CDDP encapsulation.
[00538] A 4 liter glass beaker was set on a ring stand and the mixer was fitted with a high-shear
radial impeller above a medium-shear bottom impeller. About 2,500 mL of 1% polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA) in water was added to the beaker and the mixing speed was set to about 1,800
rpm. A solution having a concentration of about 200 mg/mL of PDLLA was prepared by
dissolving about 1 gram of PDLLA in about 5 mL of dichloromethane.        The CDDP/oxidized
cellulose microspheres were then added to the PDLLA solution and vortexed to ensure a uniform
distribution of the microspheres in the PDLLA solution thereby forming a suspension.
[00539]    The suspension was then added to the PVA solution. Mixing was maintained at about
1,810 rpm for about 5 minutes after which, the speed was reduced to about 1,150 rpm for about
                                                116

60 minutes. About 500 mL of distilled water was then added to the emulsion to extract
dichloromethane from the multi-encapsulated microspheres, namely, PDLLA microspheres
encapsulating the CDDP/oxidized cellulose microsphere. The multi-encapsulated microspheres
were harvested after about 2.5 hours of mixing. The microspheres were washed with distilled
water to remove all traces of the PVA. They were then collected off each sieve by filtration. The
collected microspheres were then air-dried for about 24 hours.
[00540] Collected microspheres were imaged using Keyence VHX-600, a light microscope,
which are shown in Fig. 21 at about 1,000x. Microspheres were also embedded in epoxy and a
cross-sectional slice of thereof was obtained, which was then imaged using a FEI Quanta 600
FEG SEM, which is shown in Fig. 22 at about 1,475x. The images of Figs. 21 and 22 show
larger PDLLA microspheres encapsulating a plurality of oxidized cellulose microspheres, which
were observed to be gold (Fig. 21), which in turn, encapsulate CDDP, which was observed to be
red (Fig. 22).
[00541] CDDP, a water-soluble compound, was successfully encapsulated in microspheres
formed from solubilized oxidized cellulose using an oil-in-oil (o/o), solvent extraction method.
These microspheres were then encapsulated in polylactide microspheres, using a solid-in-oil-in
water modified emulsion, solvent extraction (MESE) method. The "microsphere(s)-in-a
microsphere" particles were free-flowing and easily handled, no fragility was observed. Since
CDDP encapsulation was conducted without water, sodium chloride was not required, which is
used when aqueous systems are employed in encapsulating CDDP to prevent transforming the
cis form of CDDP into trans, which is has diminishing bioactive effect.

[00543]   The same process was followed as set forth in Example 9 above, except about 100
milligrams of ferrous gluconate was added to the oxidized cellulose solution.
[00544]   Collected microparticles were collected on a glass slide and imaged using an Olympus
SZX16, a light microscope, which are shown in Fig. 23 at about 40x. The images show
microspheres having a substantially spherical shape and measuring about 100 ptm in diameter.

cellulose microspheres from a 17% by weight/volume oxidized cellulose solution including 1%

[00546] Approximately 4,000 mg of 17% by weight/volume oxidized cellulose solution was
added into a glass scintillation vial to which approximately 300 mg of vitamin B-12 and about
1,000 mg of NMP were added and vortexed for about 30 seconds. The vitamin B-12 and
oxidized cellulose solution was then added drop-wise to a 1 liter glass beaker containing about
200 mL heavy mineral oil and about 400 mL of cottonseed oil and mixed for about 2.5 hours.
Subsequently, about 200 mL of cottonseed oil and about 50 mL of n-heptane were added and
were mixed for about an additional 15 minutes. The contents were poured through a set of
approximately 12-inch diameter stainless steel sieves, stacked in descending order, 250 ptm, 150
ptm, 105 ptm, 75 pim, and 25 pim. Microspheres were harvested in each size range and were then
                                                 118

washed with n-heptane to remove any residual oil from their surface.
[00547]    The oxidized cellulose microspheres containing vitamin B-12 were collected on
Whatman #4 filter paper under vacuum and air dried overnight before being bottled under an
argon overlay.

[00549] Approximately 4,000 mg of 17% by weight/volume oxidized cellulose solution was
added into a glass scintillation vial to which approximately 330 milligrams of CDDP was added.
The vial was then capped and vortexed for about 30 seconds to ensure a uniform suspension. The
uniform suspension, was continuously shaken by hand since the oxidized cellulose solution is
thixotropic and was then added drop-wise to a 1 liter glass beaker containing about 200 mL
heavy mineral oil and about 400 mL of cottonseed oil and mixed for about 2.5 hours.
Subsequently, about 200 mL of cottonseed oil and about 50 mL of n-heptane were added and
were mixed for about an additional 15 minutes. The contents were poured through a set of
approximately 12-inch diameter stainless steel sieves, stacked in descending order, 250 ptm, 150
ptm, 105 ptm, 75 ptm, and 25 pim. Microspheres were harvested in each size range and were then
washed with n-heptane to remove any residual oil from their surface.
[00550]    The oxidized cellulose microspheres containing CDDP were collected on Whatman #4
filter paper under vacuum and air dried overnight before being bottled under an argon overlay.

EXAMPLE 17
[005511            Formation of poly-L,-lactide (PDLLA) microspheres encapsulating cis
diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) loaded oxidized cellulose microspheres and vitamin B
12 loaded oxidized cellulose microspheres.
[00552] About 800 mg of 100% PLLA was added to about 5 mL of dichloromethane in a glass
scintillation vial, which was shaken to dissolve PLLA. Upon complete dissolution of the PLLA,
about 600 mg of CDDP loaded microspheres sized from about 25 gm to about 75gm and about
600 mg of vitamin-B12 loaded oxidized cellulose microspheres sized from about 25 gm to about
75gm were added to the PLLA solution and the vial was securely capped and vortexed for about
20 seconds to ensure a uniform suspension.
[00553]     The uniform suspension was poured, using a long neck glass funnel, into a 1% aqueous
solution by weight/volume of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and mixed. The microspheres
encapsulating CDDP loaded microspheres and vitamin-B 12 loaded oxidized cellulose
microspheres were formed and collected on stainless steel sieves set in descending size and
washed with de-ionized water to remove any trace of PVA. Each size fraction was then collected
on Whatman # 4 filter paper under vacuum and allowed to air dry overnight. Each size fraction
was transferred to a tared and labeled scintillation vial and weighed. An argon overlay was added
to the vial and was then capped, parafilmed and stored at about 4 0C until needed.
[00554]     Collected microspheres were imaged using an Olympus SZX16, a light microscope,
which are shown in Fig. 24 at about 1,000x. The image of Fig. 24 shows a larger PLLA
microsphere encapsulating CDDP loaded oxidized cellulose microspheres, which were observed
to be gold, and vitamin-B 12 loaded oxidized cellulose microspheres, which were observed to be
red.

[00555]    Release rates of the CDDP and vitamin B-12 encapsulated in the microspheres of
microspheres of Example 17 were also measured and are shown in plots of Figs. 25 and 26. Fig.
25 shows plots of a release rate of platinum, which is indicative of the release of CDDP and a
release rate of cobalt, which is indicative of the release of vitamin B-12 over about 100 hours.
Fig. 26 shows a plot of a release rate of cobalt, which is indicative of the release of vitamin B-12
over 250 hours.
EXAMPLE 18
[00556] Analysis of degree of oxidation of Oxidized Cellulose of Example 1.
[00557]    Degree of oxidation of dissolved oxidized cellulose was analyzed using conductimetric
and pH metric titration and compared with undissolved oxidized cellulose.
[00558]    Multiple samples from about 90 mg - 700 mg of dissolved and undissolved oxidized
cellulose were prepared. Each of the samples was dissolved in about 15 mL of a sodium
hydroxide (NaOH) solution having molarity (M) from about 0.05 M to about 0.5 M. The
solutions were titrated with a hydrogen chloride (HCl) solution from about 0.05 M to about 0.5
M on a TIM 845 titration apparatus, from Radiometer Analytical SAS, Villeurganne Cedex,
France and conductimetric and pH-metric curves were obtained. A blank titration was done in
the same conditions to determine the NaOH concentration.
[00559]    The conductometric titration curves showed the presence of strong alkali,
corresponding to the excess of NaOH and a weak alkali corresponding to the carboxyl content, as
shown in an illustrative conductometric curve of Fig. 27. The characteristic pH-metric curve is
shown in the Fig. 28, in which the equivalence point corresponds to the residual NaOH in the
samples.
                                                  121

[00560]    The degree of oxidation for each sample was calculated using the following formulas
(I) and (II):
[00561]    (I) DO =    162 x n(COOH)
                     w -(14 x n(COOH)
[00562]    (II) n (COOH)   = (V2 - VI) x C (HCl)
[00563]    In which V2 is the volume of HCl in liters obtained by the blank titration or from the
conductometric curve as indicated in Fig. 27; VI is the amount HCl in liters as shown in Fig. 27,
or the equivalence point from the pH-metric titration of Fig. 28; C is HCl concentration in moles
per liter (Mol/L) an w is the weight of oven-dried sample of undissolved oxidized cellulose in
grams.
[00564]    The degree of oxidation of non-dissolved oxidized cellulose and for dissolved oxidized
cellulose of Example 1 samples are summarized in Table 3 below:

EXAMPLE 19
[00565]    Formation of oxidized cellulose microspheres encapsulating CDDP loaded PLGA
microspheres and doxorubicin loaded PLGA microspheres.
[00566] Approximately 2 grams of 15% by weight/volume oxidized cellulose solution was
added into a glass scintillation vial to which approximately 150 mg of Vitamin E d-alpha
tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) was added and vortexed for a minimum
of about 30 seconds to ensure its complete dissolution. Approximately 50 mg of CDDP loaded
microspheres containing about 16.65 mg of CDDP along with approximately 40 mg of
doxorubicin loaded microspheres containing about 13.32 mg of doxorubicin were added to the
solution. The vial was capped and vortexed from about 15 to about 20 seconds.
[00567]    The oxidized cellulose solution containing CDDP loaded microspheres and
doxorubicin loaded microspheres was added drop-wise to a 1 liter glass beaker containing about
500 mL heavy mineral oil and about 250 mL of cottonseed oil and mixed for about 90 minutes at
about 450 RPM. Another 200 mL of heavy mineral oil was added to further extract the NMP
solvent from the oxidized cellulose microspheres.
[00568] About 50 mL of n-heptane was added at approximately the 2.5 hour time point and
allowed to mix for about 15 minutes and the entire contents were poured through a set of
approximately 12-inch diameter stainless steel sieves, stacked in descending order, 300 ptm, 200
ptm, 105 ptm, and 25 jim. Microspheres were harvested in each size range and were then washed
with n-heptane to remove any residual oil from their surface.
[00569]    The oxidized cellulose microspheres encapsulating CDDP loaded microspheres and of
doxorubicin loaded microspheres were collected on Whatman #4 filter paper under vacuum and
air-dried overnight before being bottled under an argon overlay.
                                                 123

[00570]   Collected microspheres were imaged using a FEI Quanta 600/650 FEG SEM, which
are shown in Fig. 29 at about 516x. Intact microspheres were imaged in mineral oil, using
transmitted light. The SEM images show microspheres having a spherical shape and a smooth
outer surface. Collected microsphere was also imaged using a Keyence VHX-600 light
microscope, which is shown in Fig. 30 at about 1,000x. The microsphere was imaged in low
vacuum conditions using a backscatter electron detector. The image of Fig. 30 shows a larger
oxidized cellulose microsphere encapsulating CDDP loaded PLGA microspheres, which were
observed as dark spots, and doxorubicin loaded PLGA microspheres, which were observed to be
red.
[00571]   The microsphere of Fig. 30 was imbedded in epoxy and a cross-section thereof was
obtained. The cross-section of the microsphere was imaged using Keyence VHX-600 light
microscope, which is shown in Fig. 31 at about 1,000x. The image of Fig. 31 shows that the
oxidized cellulose microsphere encapsulating CDDP loaded PLGA microspheres, which were
observed to be orange, and doxorubicin loaded PLGA microspheres, which were observed to be
red.
[00572]   The cross-section of the microsphere of Fig. 30 was also imaged using FEI Quanta
600/650 FEG SEM, which is shown in Fig. 32 at about 1914x. The image of Fig. 32 shows
platinum crystals, which are indicative of the presence of CDDP.
[00573]   The cross-section of the microspheres of Fig. 30 was further imaged using FEI Quanta
600/650 FEG SEM with color-coded energy dispersive spectra (EDS) map, which is shown in
Fig. 33. The EDS map suggests diffuse distribution of CDDP, observed as green in color,
throughout the oxidized cellulose microsphere, with higher concentrations in some specific
areas. The EDS map also shows areas of higher concentration of carbon, observed as blue in
                                                124

color, which is inferred as the inner microspheres loaded with doxorubicin.
EXAMPLE 20
[00574] Covalent crosslinking of oxidized cellulose microspheres of Example 19.
[00575] A 5.0% solution by weight/volume of aziridine was prepared by adding about 5 mL of
aziridine to a 100 mL Class A volumetric flask and filling to the 100 mL mark with n-heptane.
Approximately 700 mg to about 1.5 grams of oxidized cellulose microspheres of Example 19
were carefully introduced into the mouth of a spheronizer and the speed of the unit was adjusted
to ensure the particles were tumbling over each other without being ejected. About 10 mL of
5.0% aziridine solution was transferred into the chamber of the spheronizer containing the
oxidized microspheres of Example 19 to be crosslinked and the speed of the rotation was set at
approximately 50 rpm. Approximately 15 minutes after starting the rotation and allowing for
crosslinking to occur, a stream of nitrogen was directed slightly into the open end of the
spheronizer to facilitate the evaporation of the n-heptane until the microbeads were tumbling
freely in the chamber. The microspheres were collected only after they tumbled freely in the
chamber upon which time they were collected and bottled in 10 mL Wheaton vials under an
argon overlay, labeled and stored at room temperature until needed.
EXAMPLE 21
[00576] Triglyceride overcoating of oxidized cellulose microspheres of Example 19.
[00577] A 0.5% solution by weight/volume of triglyceride in n-heptane was prepared by
weighing 500 mg of the triglyceride into a 100 mL Class A volumetric flask and filling to the
100 mL mark with n-heptane. The flask was capped and gently swirled until the triglyceride was
                                                 125

completely dissolved.
[00578] Approximately 10 mL of the triglyceride solution was transferred into the open end of
a spheronizer along with the oxidized cellulose microspheres of Example 19 to be overcoated
and the speed of the rotation was set at about 50 rpm while a stream of nitrogen was directed
slightly into the open end of the spheronizer to facilitate the evaporation of the n-heptane thereby
depositing a thin overcoat of triglyceride onto the surface of the microspheres and forming
overcoated oxidized cellulose microspheres. The overcoated microspheres were collected only
after they tumbled freely in the chamber. They were bottled in 10 mL Wheaton vials under an
argon overlay, labeled and stored at room temperature until needed.
