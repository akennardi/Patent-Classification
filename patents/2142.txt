   1. Field of the Utility Model
            The present utility model relates to a container, especially to a
   container that is capable of receiving food.
 5 2. Description of the Prior Arts
            When buying food and drink, a consumer needs to use two hands to
   hold the food and the drink separately, so that the consumer has to put down the
   drink first and then the consumer can eat the food. Therefore, it is not
   convenient.
10          A conventional container is capable of covering a drink cup. Even
   though the conventional container covers the drink cup and contains food, e.g.
   popcorn, at the same time, a user still can drink a beverage contained in the
   drink cup. Precisely, a common drink cup forms an annular flange on a top
   edge thereof, and, correspondingly, said conventional container forms an
15 annular rib on an inner wall thereof, so that the annular flange and the annular
   may be engaged with each other and thereby said container can be mounted on
   the drink cup.
            However, different manufacturers may provide drink cups in various
   sizes and dimensions, and even one manufacturer may provide multiple types
20 of the drink cups, diameters of the various drink cups are different, which
   makes the annular rib not capable of engaging the various annular flanges of
   the different drink cups.
            To overcome the shortcomings, the present utility model provides a
   container structure to mitigate or obviate the aforementioned problems.

                                            2
            The main objective of the present utility model is to provide a container
   structure that is capable of being mounted on different drink cups with various
   dimensions.
            The container structure for covering a drink cup has a covering lid and
 5 an outer annular wall. The covering lid has a top board and an inner annular
   wall. The top board has a straw hole. A horizontal cross section of the inner
   annular wall is progressively greater from a top to a bottom of the inner annular
   wall. A top edge of the inner annular wall is connected to an edge of the top
   board. The inner annular wall has a plurality of cut slits arranged in at least one
10 height position of the inner annular wall. Each said height position has multiple
   said cut slits. A horizontal cross section of the outer annular wall is
   progressively greater from a bottom to a top of the outer annular wall. A lower
   edge of the outer annular wall is connected to a lower edge of the inner annular
   wall. A top edge of the drink cup is engaged with the cut slits of the inner
15 annular wall in the same height position.
            One of the advantages of the container structure of the present utility
   model is that the container structure can be mounted on different drink cups
   with various dimensions, so people may not have to prepare many different
   container structures for different drink cups. Thus, the costs of manufacturing
20 and storage are reduced.
            Other objectives, advantages and novel features of the utility model
   will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken
   in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

            Please refer to Figs. 1 and 2. The first embodiment of the present utility
   model provides a container structure for covering a drink cup 90. The container
   structure of the present utility model comprises a covering lid 10, an outer
10 annular wall 20, and a covering component 30. The covering lid 10 is mounted
   on an upper edge of the drink cup 90 so that an upper opening of the drink cup
   90 is shaded by the container structure of the present utility model. The outer
   annular wall 20 encircles the covering lid 10 so that a space is formed
   therebetween for accommodating          food. In this embodiment, shapes of
15 horizontal cross sections of the covering lid 10 and outer annular wall 20 are
   round, but it is not limited thereto.
            The covering lid 10 comprises a top board 11 and an inner annular wall
   12. The top board 11 forms an edge, a straw hole 111, and a cavity 112. The
   cavity 112 is located on the top surface of the covering lid 10. In this
20 embodiment, the edge of the top board 11 protrudes and extends upwardly. The
   straw hole 111 is located at a center of the top board 11, but it is not limited
   thereto.
            Then please refer to Figs. 3 and 4. The horizontal cross section of the
   inner annular wall 12 is progressively greater from a top to a bottom of the

                                            5
   inner annular wall, and the inner annular wall 12 has an upper edge, a lower
   edge, and a plurality of cut slits 121. The upper edge of the inner annular wall
   12 is connected to the edge of the top board 11, so an upper surface of the top
   board 11 (also is an upper surface of the covering lid 10) is lower than the
 5 upper edge of the inner annular wall 12, and thereby the cavity 112 is formed
   thereon. The cut slits 121 are formed between the upper edge and the lower
   edge of the inner annular wall 12 and are annularly disposed. In this
   embodiment, all of the cut slits 121 are disposed in one height position; in
   another embodiment, the cut slits 121 may be disposed in multiple height
10 positions, and each height position has multiple cut slits 121.
            Each one of the cut slits 121 forms a lateral cut line 1211 and two
   vertical cut lines 1212. The lateral cut line 1211 is formed through the inner
   annular wall 12 and extends laterally on the inner annular wall 12. The two
   vertical cut lines 1212 are formed through the inner annular wall 12,
15 communicate with two ends of the lateral cut line 1211 respectively, and extend
   upward from the two ends of the lateral cut line 1211. In other words, in this
   embodiment, with the cut slit 121, the inner annular wall 12 forms a plurality of
   foldable pieces 122, and an upper edge of each one of the foldable pieces 122 is
   connected to a main body of the inner annular wall 12.
20          The horizontal cross section of the outer annular wall 20 is
   progressively greater from a bottom to a top of the outer annular wall 20, a
   lower edge of the outer annular wall 20 is connected to the lower edge of the
   inner annular wall 12, and an upper edge of the outer annular wall 20 is not
   lower than the upper edge of the inner annular wall 12, but it is not limited

                                             6
   thereto. Therefore, the space in the outer annular wall 20 is capable of
   accommodating food, and since the lower edge of the outer annular wall 20 is
   lower than the top board 11 of the covering lid 10, the food can be received in
   the space lower than the top board 11, and thereby more food can be
 5 accommodated.
            Please refer to Figs. 1 and 2 again. The covering component 30 is
   detachably connected to the outer annular wall 20 and shades an upper opening
   of the outer annular wall 20. In this embodiment, the outer annular wall 20
   forms a plurality of cut slits 21, and the cut slits 21 of the outer annular wall 20
10 are adjacent to the upper edge of the outer annular wall 20. Correspondingly,
   the covering component 30 forms a plurality of tabs 31. Each tab 3 1 protrudes
   and extends out of the edge of the covering component 30, and the tabs 31 are
   respectively and selectively mounted through the cut slits 21 of the outer
   annular wall 20. Therefore, the covering component 30 is capable of being
15 fixed on the outer annular wall 20. The covering component 30 further forms a
   folding line 32 so that the covering component 30 is capable of being folded
   along the folding line 32. One of the tabs 31 is disposed on one side of the
   folding line 32 of the covering component 30, and the remaining tabs 31 are
   disposed on another side of the folding line 32 of the covering component 30,
20 so that when the covering component 30 is fixed on the outer annular wall 20,
   the side of the covering component 30 with one tab 31 can be detached from or
   secured on the outer annular wall 20 easily and thereby a user can open or close
   the outer annular wall 20 easily.
            Then please refer to Figs. 3 and 5. With aforesaid structures, when the

                                             7
   container structure of the present utility model is mounted on the drink cup 90,
   an upper edge 91 of the drink cup 90 is mounted in the cut slits 121 disposed in
   the same height position of the inner annular wall 12. For example, the drink
   cup 90 may comprise a cup body and a cup lid, and the cup lid may be securely
 5 mounted on the cup body to form said upper edge 91. The upper edge 91 is a
   flange protruding outward. To mount the container structure of the present
   utility model on the drink cup 90, the drink cup 90 is put into a space formed in
   the inner annular wall 12 from a lower side of the covering lid 10 till the drink
   cup 90 abuts an inner surface of the inner annular wall 12 of the covering lid 10
10 and is aligned with the cut slits 121 disposed in the same height position, and
   then the upper edge 91 is engaged with the cut slits 121. Besides, if a drink cup
   is configured without any cup lid, a flange around an opening of the drink cup
   can be engaged with the cut slits 121.
            For stably engaging the upper edge 91 of the drink cup 90 in the cut
15 slits 121 of the inner annular wall 12, an inner diameter corresponding to the
   height position of the inner annular wall 12 forming the cut slits 121 is slightly
   smaller than an outer diameter of the upper edge 91 of the drink cup 90.
   Moreover, as the horizontal cross section of the inner annular wall 12 is
   progressively greater from the top to the bottom of the inner annular wall 12,
20 when the drink cup 90 is put into the inner annular wall 12, the upper edge 91
   of the drink cup 90 may be compressed to deform inward. After the drink cup
   90 is put in the inner annular wall 12 in an adequate depth and the upper edge
   91 is aligned with the cut slits 121 of the inner annular wall 12, portions of the
   upper edge 91 corresponding to the cut slits 121 may restore to its original

                                             8
   shape and push the foldable pieces 122, so that the upper edge 91 can extend
   out of the lateral cut lines 1211 of the cut slits 121 and be engaged in the cut
   slits 121. Therefore, even though the outer diameters of the different drink cups
   90 may vary, the container structure of the present utility model still can be
 5 engaged with different drink cups 90.
            Then please refer to Figs. 3 and 6. In another embodiment, the cut slits
   121 may be arranged in multiple circles, and said circles are spaced apart
   vertically. In other words, the cut slits 121 of the inner annular wall 12 may be
   disposed in different height positions, and the cut slits 121 in the same height
10 position may be arranged in a circle. Therefore, the upper edge 91 of the drink
   cup 90 may be put into the inner annular wall 12 to align the cut slits 121 in the
   adequate height position, so that the container structure of the present utility
   model can be mounted on the different drink cups 90 with various dimensions.
            Then please refer to Figs. 7 and 8. In a second embodiment, technical
15 features are similar to those of the first embodiment, i.e. each one of the cut
   slits 121A on the inner annular wall 12A of the covering lid 10A still forms a
   lateral cut line 1211 A and two vertical cut lines 1212A, and the lateral cut line
   1211 A is formed through the inner annular wall 12A and extends laterally on
   the inner annular wall 12A. However, in this embodiment, the two vertical cut
20 lines 1212A are formed through the inner annular wall 12A, communicate with
   two ends of the lateral cut line 121 1A respectively, and extend downward from
   the two ends of the lateral cut line 1211 A rather than extend upward. Therefore,
   in the second embodiment, with the cut slits 121A, the inner annular wall 12A
   also forms a plurality of foldable pieces 122A, but the lower edges of the

                                           9
   foldable pieces 122A are connected to the main body of the inner annular wall
   12A.
            Similar to the first embodiment, to mount the container structure of the
   second embodiment of the present utility model on the drink cup 90, the drink
 5 cup 90 is put into the space formed in the inner annular wall 12A, and then the
   upper edge of the drink cup 90 may be compressed and deform slightly. When
   aligned with the cut slits 121A, the upper edge 91 of the drink cup 90 is capable
   of extending through the lateral cut lines 1211A of the cut slits 121A. Then
   each one of the foldable pieces 122A in the cut slits 121A is pushed inward till
10 upper edges of the foldable pieces 122A are engaged with a bottom portion of
   the upper edge 91, which makes the drink cup 90 be fixed in the inner annular
   wall 12A.
            Then please refer to Figs. 9 and 10. In a third embodiment of the
   present utility model, technical features are similar to those of the first or the
15 second embodiment, but one of the differences between the third embodiment
   and the first and the second embodiments is that the covering lid 1OB further
   comprises a partition component 13B. The partition component 13B is securely
   mounted on the cavity 112 of the top board 11 and thereby the cavity 112 is
   divided into multiple areas. Therefore, different sauces may be put in the
20 different areas respectively.
            The partition component 13B may comprise a top piece 13 1B and two
   connecting pieces 132B. The top piece 13 1B extends horizontally, and the two
   connecting pieces 132B are connected to two sides of the top piece 13 1B and
   extend downward from the top piece 131B to the upper surface of the top board

                                            10
   11. In other words, in this embodiment, a vertical section of the partition
   component 13B is in a U-shape. The top piece 131B may have a straw hole
   13 1OB. The straw hole 13 1OB of the top piece 131B faces to the straw hole (not
   shown in the figures) of the top board 11. In another embodiment, the vertical
 5 section of the partition component 13B may be in an inverted V-shape.
            Another difference between the third embodiment and the first and the
   second embodiments is that the upper edge of the outer annular wall 20B is
   only slightly higher than the upper edge of the inner annular wall 12. Therefore,
   a height position of the straw hole of the top board 11 or the straw hole 131 OB
10 of the top piece 131B is close to that of the upper edge of the outer annular wall
   20B and thus the straw hole or the straw hole 131 OB may not be covered by
   food.
            Please refer to Figs. 11 to 14. In the fourth embodiment of the present
    utility model, technical features are similar to those of the aforementioned
15  embodiments, but one of the differences is that horizontal cross sections of the
    covering lid 1OC and the outer annular wall 20C are polygonal and thus the
    outer annular wall 20C has a plurality of side surfaces. Another difference is
    that each one of the cut slits 121C may have a lateral cut line but does not
    have any vertical cut line so that the outer annular wall 20C does not have any
20  foldable piece. However, the cut slits 121C of the fourth embodiment may be
    similar to the cut slits of the aforementioned embodiment that comprises the
    lateral cut line and the vertical cut lines. In this embodiment, the lateral cut
    line forms through the inner annular wall 12C and horizontally extends on the
    inner annular wall 12C. The cut slits 121C may be arranged on the multiple

                                          11
   side surfaces of the inner annular wall 12C in one height position and thereby
   arranged in one circle, or in multiple height positions and thereby arranged in
   multiple circles. Therefore, the container structure can be mounted on the
   different drink cups 90 of various outer diameters via the upper edge of each
 5 drink cup 90. Depending on the size of the outer diameters, the upper edges of
   the different drink cups 90 extend for various degrees through the cut slits
    121C in the same height position.
          Then please refer to Figs. 12, 14, and 15. In the fourth embodiment,
   each side surface of the inner annular wall 12C of the covering lid 1OC forms
10 a folded portion 123C. The folded portion 123C is located on a lower edge of
   the side surface and extends outward and upward. A lower edge of each one of
   the side surfaces of the outer annular wall 20C is securely mounted on an
   upper surface of one of the folded portions 123C of the inner annular wall
    12C, which prevents the outer annular wall 20 from falling down. In this
15 embodiment, the outer annular wall 20C is detachably mounted on the inner
   annular wall 12C. Precisely, the outer annular wall 20C forms a plurality of
   gaps 22C. Each one of the gaps 22C is located on the lower edge of the outer
   annular wall 20C and between the adjacent two of the side surfaces of the
   outer annular wall 20C. Each one of the gaps 22C forms a protrusion in the
20 middle thereof and the protrusion extends downward, so that the folded
   portions 123C can extend into an inner side of the outer annular wall 20C
   through the gaps 22C, and thereby the outer annular wall 20C is fixed on the
   inner annular wall 12. In other words, the outer annular wall 20C and the
   inner annular wall 12C may be fixed via frictions therebetween.

                                          12
            In this embodiment, the top board llC of the covering lid 1OC
   comprises a straw hole 111C, a center piece 113C, two side pieces 114C, and a
   plurality of upward folded pieces 115C. The straw hole 111C is formed on the
   center piece 113C. The center piece 113C may correspond to the partition
 5 component of the aforementioned embodiment, and thus the center piece 113C
   protrudes upward. The center piece 113C may comprise two hook portions
   1130C. The two hook portions 1130C are formed on two ends of the center
   piece 113C respectively and hook on the upper edge of the inner annular wall
   12C, which keeps the center piece 113C protruding upward. The two side
10 pieces 114C are mounted on two sides of the center piece 113C and extend
   outward from lower edges of the two sides of the center piece 113C. The
   upward folded pieces 115C are mounted on the side pieces 114C and extend
   upward from outer edges of the side pieces 114C. A number of the upward
   folded pieces 115C equals to a number of the side surfaces of the inner annular
15 wall 12. Thus, the upward folded pieces 115C are respectively and securely
   mounted on the side surfaces of the inner annular wall 12.
            Consequently, the container structure of the present utility model is
   capable of being mounted on different drink cups 90 with various dimensions,
   so people may not have to prepare many different container structures for
20 different drink cups 90. Thus, the costs of manufacturing and storage are
   reduced.

                                              13
