   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 5 1. Field of the invention
            The present disclosure relates to a lawn mower robot having a wheel
   driven using an electric motor as a power source.
   2. Description of the related art
10          A lawn mower is a device for trimming grass planted on the yard or
   playground at home. Such lawn mowers may be divided into household mowers
   for household use and tractor mowers for use on a large playground or farm.
            For household lawn mowers, there exist walk-behind type mowers in
   which a person mows grass while directly pulling a lawn mower from behind and
15 hand type lawn mowers in which a person carries a lawn mower by hand.
            However, both types of lawn mowers require a user to directly operate the
   lawn mowers.
            Especially, in a busy daily life, it is difficult for the user to directly operate
   the lawn mower to cut the lawn of the yard, and therefore, workers are mostly
20 hired outside, resulting in employment costs.
            Accordingly, automatic robot-type          lawn mowers       for preventing the
   occurrence of such additional costs and reducing the user's labor have been
   developed. Such an automatic robot-type lawn mower is provided with four moving
   wheels at a lower portion of the vehicle body.
25          For example, of the four moving wheels, front wheels are capable of
                                                1

   turning direction, and rear wheels are provided with wheels that rotate using a
   driving force of a motor.
              However, when some of moving wheels in the related art are caught on a
   cliff and floating in the air from the ground without touching the ground, a safety
 5 accident may occur because sensors capable of sensing it is not provided therein.
              In addition, a gear box is provided between a conventional wheel and a
   motor, and gears are coupled to each other in the gear box so that a rotational
   speed of the motor is reduced by a gear ratio and transmitted to the wheel.
              For the gears provided in the conventional gear box, a metal gear or a
10 low-cost plastic gear may be integrated thereinto depending on the type of the
   gear.
              However, according to a lawn mower robot in the related art, a fastening
   structure between a body and a gear box of the lawn mower robot may be
   different depending on which type of gear between the metal gear and the plastic
is gear is applied thereto, thereby causing difficulty in replacing the gear box having
   a different type of gear on the same lawn mower robot.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
15
             Hereinafter, a lawn mower robot associated with the present disclosure
   will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. A singular
   representation may include a plural representation as far as it represents a
   definitely different meaning from the context.
20           In describing the embodiments disclosed herein, moreover, the detailed
   description will be omitted when a specific description for publicly known
   technologies to which the invention pertains is judged to obscure the gist of the
   present invention.
             FIG. 1 is a perspective view illustrating an appearance of a lawn mower
25 robot according to the present disclosure, and FIG. 2 is an exploded perspective
                                               9

   view of FIG. 1, and FIG. 3 is a side cross-sectional view of FIG. 1.
            The lawn mower robot may be largely configured with an outer cover 10
   and an inner body 20.
            The outer cover 10 is configured to surround an outer side of the inner
 5 body 20 and forms an outer appearance of the robot. The outer cover 10 is a
   structure for preventing a person's hand or foot from entering an inside of the
   outer cover 10 in order to protect him or her from an impact due to the rotation of
   the blade 31 because the blade 31 rotating at a high speed is mounted thereon. A
   lower end portion of the outer cover 10 should be disposed to be spaced apart at a
10 preset height in accordance with safety standards. It is because when a lower end
   portion of the outer cover 10 is disposed too high from the ground, a person's
   hand or foot may enter the inside from the outside and cause a fatal injury, and
   when the outer cover 10 is disposed too low from the ground, the load may
   increase when mowing grass.
15          The outer cover 10 includes a bumper portion 1Ca capable of colliding with
   an obstacle at the front and a fender portion 10b forming a curved surface to
   mount wheels 50 at the rear on both side surfaces thereof. The bumper portion
   10a surrounds a front end portion and a front side portion of the outer cover 10
   and is thicker than the other portions. The fender portion 10b is configured to
20 surround an outer surface of the wheel 50 and the width of the vehicle is wider
   than elsewhere.
            A carry handle 10c may be provided at an upper portion of the outer cover
   10. The carry handle 10c may be configured such that both sides of the outer
   cover 10 are respectively formed to be inclined upward from a side front upper
25 portion of the outer cover 10 to the rear side, and a rear end portion thereof is
                                            10

   protruded to a rear upper portion of the outer cover to form a closed curved
   surface. The carry handle 10c may be formed, for example, in a "U" shape. The
   carry handle 10c having such a structure allows the blade 31 located on a bottom
   surface of the inner body 20 to face an outside of the user when the carry handle
 5 1 Cc is lifted for the user's safety during transportation.
              The outer cover 10 may be disposed at an upper portion of the inner body
   20 such that the front and rear surfaces and left and right side surfaces thereof are
   spaced apart from the inner body 20 in the front, rear, left, and right directions,
   thereby absorbing an impact from an obstacle.
10            A first cover 11 and a second cover 14 may be disposed at an upper
   portion of the outer cover 10 to be spaced apart from each other in a front-rear
   direction, and an emergency stop switch 13 may be provided between the first
   cover 11 and the second cover 14. The emergency stop switch 13 may be
   protruded higher than the other portions of the outer cover 10 except for the carry
15 handle 10c, thereby having an advantage of facilitating the user's operation. The
   emergency stop switch 13 is disposed at a rear side of the outer cover 10, and
   configured to allow the user to operate the rear cover 10 from the rear side of the
   outer cover 10 in consideration of the user's safety in an emergency.
              An ultrasonic sensor 18 may be provided at a front side of the outer cover
20 10. The ultrasonic sensor 18 may be configured to sense an obstacle in the front
   to reduce a driving speed of the wheels 50.
              The inner body 20 serves as a main body of the robot.
              The caster 40 may be mounted on a front bottom surface of the inner body
   20 to be pivotable through 360 degrees about the rotation shaft so that the driving
25 direction of the robot can be controlled in the left and right direction according to a
                                                 11

   pivot angle of the caster 40.
            The wheels 50 are rotatably mounted on both the rear side surfaces of the
   inner body 20, respectively, to drive the robot. The wheels 50 rotate using a drive
   motor as a power source to move the robot forward or backward.
 5          A plurality of blades 31 are rotatably provided on a bottom surface of the
   inner body 20, and the plurality of blades 31 rotate to cut down grass.
            The plurality of blades 31 are rotatably mounted at an edge portion of the
   rotating plate 32. The plurality of blades 31 may be spaced apart at regular
   intervals along a circumferential direction of the rotating plate 32. The plurality of
10 blades 31 may be configured with four blades. The four blades 31 may face each
   other in the radial direction and arranged at intervals of 90 degrees in the
   circumferential direction. A number of the blades 31 is related to a driving speed of
   the lawn mower robot and a rotational speed (RPM) of the blades 31. For example,
   when the number of the blades 31 is four, a rotational speed of the blades 31 may
15 be reduced while driving at a higher driving speed than in the case of three blades
   with the same grass cutting quality.
            Each of the plurality of blades 31 may be fastened to the rotating plate 32
   with a bolt 3221. Each of the plurality of blades 31 is formed with a fastening hole
   311 at one end portion thereof, and the bolt 3221 may be coupled thereto through
20 the fastening hole 311. Each of the plurality of blades 31 may rotate about the bolt
   3221 at the other end portion thereof.
            Each of the plurality of blades 31 may be unfolded in a radial direction by
   a centrifugal force when the rotating plate 32 rotates, and the blade 31 may be
   folded toward the center of the circle when the rotating plate 32 stops.
25          As a result, the blade 31 may be configured to be folded when it receives
                                             12

   an impact from a stone or the like stuck in the ground. The blade 31 must satisfy
   an amount of impact (kinetic energy) according to safety standards, for example, 2
   J. When the blade 31 is not folded even when the amount of impact is 2 J or more
   according to the safety standards, either one of the blade 31 and the stone may be
 5 broken and broken pieces may be thrown out of the outer cover 10 to cause
   injuries to workers in the vicinity. Therefore, in order to solve the above-described
   problem, the blade 31 may be preferably folded at an amount of impact less than
   that of the safety standards.
             FIG. 4 is a conceptual view illustrating the blade 31 of FIG. 2 and a cross
10 sectional shape thereof, and FIG. 5 is a conceptual view illustrating a state in
   which the blade 31 of FIG. 4 cuts grass, and FIG. 6 is a bottom view illustrating the
   blade of FIG. 5 mounted on the rotating plate 32.
            The blade 31 is very important to improve the quality of grass cutting. The
   blade 31 according to the present disclosure may be formed in a rectangular plate
is shape having a long length, a narrow width, and a uniform thickness. The blade 31
   according to the present disclosure is made to have a constant width along a
   length direction thereof. A width of the blade 31 may be constant to have a uniform
   strength of the blade 31 along the length direction, thereby improving durability.
            A fastening hole 311 for fastening the bolt 3221 is formed at one end
20 portion of the blade 31. One end portion of the blade 31 may be formed in a
   circular shape. The blade 31 cuts grass while rotating in a circumferential direction
   of the rotating plate 32. At this time, the blade 31 is made to cut only in a single
   rotational direction.
             It is preferable that cutting portions 312 are formed on both side surfaces
25 of the blade 31, respectively, and the cross-sectional shape of the blade 31 is a
                                                13

   parallelogram. In addition, it is preferable that a bottom surface of the cutting
   portion 312 is horizontal and an inclined surface of the cutting portion 312 is
   disposed to face upward.
            If a horizontal surface of the cutting portion 312 faces upward and an
 5 inclined surface of the cutting portion 312 faces downward, then an upper portion
   of the grass is first cut while being in contact with an end of the horizontal surface
   end of the cutting portion 312 and a lower portion of the grass is cut, thereby
   causing a problem that the cut surface of the grass is not smooth.
            The reason why the cutting portion 312 is provided on both side surfaces
10 of the blade 31 is that cutting can be carried out in the same direction even when
   the top and bottom surfaces of the blade 31 are reversed from each other.
            The blade 31 preferably satisfies the following conditions in order to have
   a good grass cutting quality while satisfying an amount of impact according to the
   safety standards, 2 J or less.
15          A length (L) of the blade 31 is preferably within a range of D/9 to D/6
   compared to a rotation diameter (D) of the blade 31. The rotation diameter (D) of
   the blade 31 refers to a diameter between outer ends of the two blades 31 facing
   each other in a radial direction of the rotating plate 32 when the blade 31 is
   unfolded as illustrated in FIG. 6. As the lawn mower robot drives, grass within the
20 rotation diameter of the blade 31 is cut by the rotating blade 31.
            A thickness of the blade 31 is preferably 0.75 to 1.25 mm.
            A width of the blade 31 is preferably 7.5 to 12.5mm.
            It is because there is a problem in which when the length, thickness, and
   width of the blade 31 are excessively larger than the upper limit values, an impact
25 amount condition according to the safety standards is not satisfied, and when they
                                              14

   are too small, the cutting quality of the grass is deteriorated. According to the
   thickness and width of the blade 31 within the numerical range, the blade 31 is not
   broken while satisfying the conditions of the impact amount of the safety standards
   or less, the reduction of the rotational speed of the blade 31 is small and the
 5 rotation load is low.
            The rotational speed of the blade 31 is preferably 2250 to 2750 rpm. It is
   because there is a problem in which when the rotational speed of the blade 31 is
   excessively high, an amount of impact (kinetic energy) according to the safety
   standards is exceeded, and when it is excessively slow, the cutting quality of the
10 grass is deteriorated.
            The rotating plate 32 is a component in which a plurality of blades 31 are
   mounted to rotate the blades 31. The rotating plate 32 is rotatably mounted on a
   bottom surface of the inner body 20. A drive motor for rotating the rotating plate 32
   may be provided within the inner body 20, and the drive motor 30 may be
is connected to a center portion of the rotating plate 32 through the rotation shaft
   301 to rotate the rotating plate 32.
            A receiving portion 23 for receiving the blade drive motor 30 may be
   formed at a central portion of the inner body 20. The receiving portion 23 is formed
   in a cylindrical tube shape that is formed from the bottom to the top of the inner
20 body 20.
            The rotating plate 32 is preferably disposed to be inclined downward with
   respect to a horizontal plane in the advancing direction of the inner body 20. The
   blade 31 mounted on the rotating plate 32 is also disposed in parallel to the
   rotating plate 32 and inclined downward with respect to the horizontal plane.
25 According to this, a front end portion of the blade 31 is positioned lower than a
                                             15

   rear end portion of the blade 31 (a portion where the fastening hole 311 of the bolt
   3221 is formed) to lower a height of the grass cut by the blade 31 as it goes to the
   front, thereby reducing a rotational load of the blade 31.
            A protruding portion 321 is formed directly below an edge bottom surface
 5 of the rotating plate 32, and a chamfered portion 322 formed to have a smaller
   diameter as it goes to downward from a lower end of the protruding portion 321 is
   formed. The bolt 3221 is fastened to the chamfered portion 322 and the protruding
   portion 321 through the fastening hole 311 of the blade 31 so that a bolt head and
   the chamfered portion 322 are spaced apart from each other by a predetermined
10 distance. A diameter of the chamfered portion 322 and the bolt head is larger than
   that of the stem portion of the bolt 3221 and the fastening hole 311 of the blade 31
   so that the upward and downward movement of the blade 31 along the stem
   portion of the bolt 3221 is limited. As a result, the blade 31 is disposed to be
   spaced apart from the rotating plate 32 in a downward direction by the protruding
is portion 321 and the chamfered portion 322. The other end portion of the blade 31
   is rotatable about the bolt 3221 and may be unfolded out of the rotating plate 32 or
   folded into the rotating plate 32. Here, the blade 31 may rotate while being spaced
   apart from the rotating plate 32 in a downward direction by the protruding portion
   321 and the chamfered portion 322, thereby avoiding interference between the
20 rotating plate 32 and the blade 31 even when the blade 31 is bent while the blade
   31 is unfolded or folded.
            A distance between the blade 31 and the outer cover 10 should be
   maintained at a predetermined distance, for example, 12 cm or more, according to
   the safety standards.
25           FIG. 7A is a perspective view illustrating a blade protection cover in FIG. 6,
                                               16

   and FIG. 7B is a side cross-sectional view of FIG 7A, and FIG. 8 is a bottom view
   of FIG. 7A.
            The blade protection cover 33 is configured to surround the blade 31. The
   protection cover of the blade 31 is disposed between the blade 31 and the outer
 5 cover 10 to minimize an obstacle such as a stone from being directly thrown out of
   the outer cover 10 while colliding with the blade 31.
            The blade protection cover 33 is spaced apart from the blade 31 at regular
   intervals.
            The blade protection cover 33 may be configured to include a blade
10 protection cover body 331, a tapered portion 333, and a plurality of protrusion
   portions 335.
            The blade protection cover body 331 may be formed in a circular plate
   shape to have a larger diameter than the rotating plate 32. A through hole 332 may
   be formed along an edge of the blade protection cover body 331 with a constant
15 curvature. The blade protection cover body 331 is disposed between the rotating
   plate 32 and a bottom surface of the inner body 20. At this time, the through holes
   332 may be arranged to overlap with the edge portions of the rotating plate 32 and
   the blades 31 in a height direction. The through holes 332 may be arranged to
   overlap with the bottom surface of the inner body 20 in a height direction. As a
20 result, a fragment of an obstacle (or foreign object) such as a stone caused by the
   collision with the blade 31 may be reflected to the ground after bumping against a
   bottom surface of the inner body 20 through the through hole 332. If the fragment
   is not discharged out of the blade protection cover 33 through the through hole
   332, then the fragment may be scattered within the blade protection cover 33
25 several times and be thrown out of the outer cover 10.
                                             17

            The tapered portion 333 is formed to be inclined downward along a
   circumferential direction at a edge portion of the blade protection cover body 331
   and disposed to surround the blade 31. The fragment generated by the collision
   with the blade 31 is reflected to the ground by the tapered portion 333 without
 5 being immediately thrown out of the outer cover 10. A lower end of the edge
   portion may be formed to have a lower height than the blade 31 from the ground.
            However, when the height of the tapered portion 333 is excessively low,
   the tapered portion 333 may further block fragments such as stones or the like
   from being thrown out to the outside, but the tapered portion 333 may be in
10 contact with the grass or the like, thereby increasing load during the movement of
   the robot. On the contrary, when the height of the tapered portion 333 is
   excessively high, load at the time of moving the lawn mower robot may be
   reduced, but there is a problem that the possibility in which fragments such as
   stones or the like is thrown out increases. Therefore, it is required to appropriately
15 adjust the height of the blade protection cover 33.
            When the tapered portion 333 is formed in front of the blade protection
   cover 33, grass having a long length before the cutting operation of the lawn
   mower robot may be caught by a front end of the blade protection cover 33,
   thereby making it difficult to enter the blade 31. Moreover, the grass forcibly
20 entered into the blade protection cover 33 may laid down below the blade 31,
   thereby making it difficult to cut the grass to a desired height.
            Therefore, the tapered portions 333 are preferably formed at both sides
   and rear a rear side of the blade protection cover 33.
            In addition, a grass inlet 334 formed in front of the blade protection cover
25 33 to have a height higher than that of the blade 31 so as to ensure entry into the
                                               18

   blade 31 is provided to secure an entry path of the grass.
            On the other hand, when the grass inlet 334 is fully open, the entry of
   grass may be efficiently maintained, but it may be impossible to prevent fragments
   from being thrown out in upward and lateral directions due to a collision with the
 5 blade 31 within the grass inlet 334.
            According to the present disclosure, a plurality of protrusion portions 335
   capable of preventing fragments from being thrown out in upward and lateral
   directions due to a collision with the blade 31 in the grass inlet 334 as well as
   allowing the grass to efficiently enter the blade 31 through the grass inlet 334 are
10 provided on the blade protection cover 33.
            The plurality of protrusion portions 335 are disposed to be spaced apart
   from each other in an arc shape at a front side of the blade protection cover body
   331.   Each of the plurality of protrusion portions 335 may be formed in a
   rectangular cross-sectional shape having a three-step bending structure.
15          Describing a rectangular cross-sectional shape having a three-step
   bending structure in the protrusion portions 335 in detail, each of the protrusion
   portions 335 may be formed to include a front surface 335a, a first inclined surface
   335b, and a second inclined surface 335b, from a front side of the blade protection
   cover 33. The front surface 335a is formed in a vertical direction in front of the
20 blade protection cover body 331. The first inclined surface 335b forms a lower
   portion of the protrusion portion 335, and is formed to be inclined downward from
   a lower end of the front surface 335a. The second inclined surface 335c forms a
   rear surface of the protrusion portion 335, and is formed to be inclined upward
   from a lower end of the first inclined surface 335b toward the rear side. The
25 protrusion portion 335 is formed to have a larger width from the front surface 335a
                                              19

   toward the second inclined surface 335c and a narrower area from an upper
   portion of the protrusion portion 335 toward the downward direction. The second
   inclined face 335c may be larger in area than the front surface 335a to reflect
   more fragments generated due to a collision with the blade 31 to the ground. An
 5 area of the front surface 335a may be smaller than that of the second inclined
   surface 335c of the protrusion portion 335 and the area may become narrower
   toward the downward direction of the protrusion portion 335, thereby securing a
   larger area of the grass inlet 334.
            Furthermore, the protrusion portion 335 has side surface portions 335d
10 which are laterally disposed to face each other on both side surfaces thereof. The
   side surface portion 335d is connected to the front surface 335a, and the first and
   second inclined surfaces 335c of the protrusion portion 335 to prevent fragments
   from being thrown out laterally due to a collision with the blade 31.
            The protrusion portion 335 includes a connecting rib 336 extended forward
15 from a front side of the blade protection cover body 331 to connect the front
   surface 335a and the side surface 335d. The connecting rib 336 may prevent
   fragments from being thrown out in an upward direction due to a collision with the
   blade 31.
            A plurality of protrusion portions 335 are arranged such that intervals
20 between the protrusion portions 335 toward the both side end portions of the grass
   inlet 334 become gradually narrower with respect to a longitudinal center line of
   the protection cover. If the plurality of protrusion portions 335 are arranged at
   regular intervals on an arc, an anteroposterior distance between the protrusion
   portions 335 may become larger toward the both side end portions of the grass
25 inlet 334 than the center portion thereof, thereby causing a problem that fragments
                                             20

   are thrown out through the anteroposterior distance between the protrusion
   portions 335. However, according to the arrangement of the protrusion portions
   335 of the present disclosure, the plurality of protrusion portions 335 may be
   disposed laterally to overlap at the grass inlet 334, thereby preventing fragments
 5 from being thrown out in a lateral direction due to a collision with the blade 31
   rotating at the grass inlet 334.
            The protrusion portion 335 located at the center of the plurality of
   protrusion portions 335 may be formed to have a smaller width than the other
   protrusion portions 335 to minimize collision with the grass.
10          The blade protection cover 33 is formed to be inclined at an angle of, for
   example, three degrees with respect to the horizontal plane so that the height of
   the protrusion portions 335 can be arranged lower than the rear surface of the
   tapered portion. At this time, the rear surface of the tapered portion 333 may be
   extended in a more elongated manner than the protrusion portion 335 in the
15 downward direction from the blade protection cover body 331 in order to prevent
   fragments from being thrown out to the maximum extent.
            A height adjusting unit may be provided on the blade protection cover
   body 331, and configured to adjust the height of the blade protection cover 33
   together with the blade 31 and the rotating plate 32 according to the height of the
20 grass cutting.
            In order to minimize a resistance due to a collision with the grass while
   driving the robot and prevent fragments such as stones or the like caused by a
   collision with the blades 31 from being thrown out of the outer cover 10 to the
   utmost, the blade protection cover 33 may be required to appropriately adjust the
25 height of the blade protection cover 33 and the blade 31 according to the height of
                                            21

   the grass cutting.
            The rear surface of the tapered portion 333 may be disposed lower than a
   rear lower end portion of the outer cover 10 when the height of the blade
   protection cover 33 is adjusted to the lowest level, thereby minimizing fragments
 5 generated due to a collision with the blade 31from being thrown out of the rear
   side of the outer cover 10.
            Here, since the blade protection cover 33 may have a structure of moving
   together with the blade 31, when the height of the blade 31 is determined, the
   height of the blade protection cover 33 may be determined at the same time.
10 However, it may be configured such that the height of the blade protection cover
   33 and the height of the rotating plate 32 of the blade 31 are independently
   adjusted.
            FIG. 9 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a coupling structure of a height
   adjusting unit 34 in FIG. 3, and FIG. 10 is a conceptual view illustrating a state in
is which the blade protection cover 33 is lowered by the operation of the height
   adjusting unit 34 in FIG. 9.
            The height adjusting unit includes a height adjusting lever 341, a rotating
   cylindrical portion 342, and a lifting frame 343.
            The height adjusting lever 341 is rotatably mounted on an upper portion of
20 the receiving portion 23 of the inner body 20. The height adjusting lever 341 may
   include a lever body 341a formed in a circular shape and a handle portion 341c
   protruding from an upper portion of the lever body 341 a.
            A rotation guide protrusion portion 342c is formed downward at an edge
   portion of the lever body 341a, and the rotation guide protrusion portion 342c is
25 mounted on the receiving portion 23 in such a manner as to surround an upper
                                               22

   end of the receiving portion 23. The lever body 341 a is restricted from being
   released from the receiving portion 23 of the inner body 20 by the rotation guide
   protrusion portion 342c when the lever body 341 a is rotated while being arranged
   to cover an upper portion of the receiving portion 23.
 5          A scale may be displayed on an upper surface of the lever body 341 a so
   that the user can recognize the height of the blade 31, and a triangular-shaped
   indicator 341d may be displayed on an upper portion of the receiving portion 23.
   As a result, the user may recognize the height of the blade 31 by reading the scale
   indicated by the indicator 341d.
10          The handle portion 341c may protrude in a radial direction across an
   upper center of the lever body 341a, and the user may manually rotate the handle
   portion 341c.
            A plurality of rotating protrusion portions 341 a may protrude at a lower
   inner side of the lever body 341 a to be spaced apart in a circumferential direction
15 to perform the role of transmitting a rotational force by manual operation of the
   handle portion 341 c to the rotating cylindrical portion 342.
            A plurality of coupling protrusions 342a are disposed apart from each
   other in a circumferential direction at an upper end portion of the rotating
   cylindrical portion 342. Each of the plurality of coupling protrusions 342a may be
20 engaged and coupled to the rotating protrusion portion 341a of the lever body
   341a so that the rotating cylindrical portion 342 can receive a rotational force from
   the height adjusting lever 341.
            A lowering restriction protrusion 342b may protrude in a circumferential
   direction on an outer surface of an upper end portion of the rotating cylindrical
25 portion 342 to have a larger diameter than the receiving portion 23, and the
                                              23

   lowering restriction protrusion 342b may be engaged with an upper end of the
   receiving portion 23, thereby restricting the rotating cylindrical portion 342 from
   being lowered.
              The rotation cylindrical portion 342 may be formed in a cylindrical tube
 5 shape, and the rotation guide protrusion 342c may be formed in a spiral direction
   along an outer circumferential surface of the rotating cylindrical portion 342, and
   the rotation guide protrusion 342c may be tooth-coupled with a spiral protrusion
   343c of the lifting frame 343a to guide the vertical movement of the lifting frame
   343.
10            The lifting frame 343 is formed in a cylindrical shape and mounted to be
   movable in a vertical direction within the receiving portion 23 of the inner body 20.
   A plurality of rotation       restricting protrusions 343a are spaced apart in a
   circumferential direction on an outer circumferential surface of the lifting frame 343,
   and each of the plurality of rotation restricting protrusions 343a extends in a
is vertical direction.
              A plurality of rotation preventing receiving grooves 343b may be formed
   within the receiving portion 23, and the rotation restricting protrusions 343a may
   be respectively received in the plurality of rotation preventing receiving grooves
   343b, thereby moving upward and downward while restricting the rotation of the
20 lifting frame 343.
              The spiral protrusion 343c may be formed along a spiral direction at an
   upper end portion of an inner circumferential surface of the lifting frame 343 to
   guide the rotation of the rotating cylindrical portion 342. A pair of the spiral
   protrusions 343c may be disposed on an inner circumferential surface of the lifting
25 frame to be spaced apart from each other in a radial direction.
                                                24

              A mounting portion 344 for mounting a driving motor is provided within the
   lifting frame 343. The drive motor is used as a power source for driving the blade
   31. The mounting portion 344 is formed to protrude from a bottom surface of the
   lifting frame 343 to an inner space thereof.
 5            A cylindrical hollow hole is formed within the mounting portion 344, and a
   partition wall 344a is formed at an inner upper side of the mounting portion 344 to
   cross the hollow hole in a radial direction. A motor receiving groove is formed at an
   upper portion of the mounting portion 344 by the partition wall 344a, and the drive
   motor is fixed in a state of being received in the motor receiving groove of the
10 mounting portion 344 to restrict the downward and lateral movement of the driving
   motor. A recess portion is formed at a lower portion of the mounting portion 344 by
   the partition wall 344a. The rotation shaft 301 of the drive motor 30 is disposed
   toward a center portion of the rotating plate 32 and protrudes into the recess
   portion through an insertion hole formed on the partition wall 344a. A plurality of
15 reinforcing ribs 344b may be arranged on an inner circumferential surface of the
   recess portion to be spaced apart in a circumferential direction, and each of the
   plurality of reinforcing ribs 344b may connect an inner circumferential surface of
   the recess portion 344a with the partition wall 344a, thereby increasing strength
   for supporting the drive motor.
20            A coupler 302 may be coupled to an outside of the rotation shaft 301 of
   the drive motor 30. The coupler 302 may surround the rotation shaft, and a
   circumferential surface thereof may be configured in an elliptically curved shape to
   transmit a rotational force of the rotation shaft 301 to the rotating plate 32.
              A shaft coupling portion 323 is protruded from an upper center portion of
25 the rotating plate 32. A coupler receiving groove may be formed in an elliptically
                                               25

   curved shape corresponding to an outer circumferential surface of the coupler 302
   within the shaft coupling portion 323 to couple the shaft coupling portion 323 to the
   coupler 302. The coupler 302 and the shaft coupling portion 323 may be received
   in the recess portion. A plurality of reinforcing ribs 324 may be arranged on an
 5 outer circumferential surface of the shaft coupling portion             323 along      a
   circumferential direction, and each of the plurality of reinforcing ribs 324 may
   connect an outer circumferential surface of the shaft coupling portion 323 to a
   center portion of the rotating plate 32, thereby increase a coupling strength
   between the shaft coupling portion 323 and the rotating plate 32. A bolt is fastened
10 to the coupler 302 through a center portion of the rotating plate 32 to couple the
   rotating plate 32 to the coupler 302. As a result, a rotational force generated from
   the drive motor 30 may be transmitted to the rotating plate 32 through the coupler
   302 and the shaft coupling portion 323 from the rotation shaft 301 to rotate the
   rotating plate 32.
15          The driving motor mounted on the mounting portion 344 of the lifting frame
   343 may move upward and downward together with the lifting frame 343.
            The mounting portion 344 is formed to be inclined at a predetermined
   angle, for example, 3 degrees, in a forward direction of the inner body 20 with
   respect to a vertical center line of the receiving portion 23, and the rotation shaft of
20 the drive motor 30 mounted on the mounting portion 344 is disposed to be inclined
   at an angle with respect to the vertical center line of the receiving portion 23.
            A lower end portion of the lifting frame 343 is vertically fastened to an
   upper center of the blade protection cover 33. At this time, the blade protection
   cover 33 is disposed to be inclined at a predetermined angle toward the front with
25 respect to the horizontal plane similarly to the rotating plate 32 and the blade 31.
                                              26

   Furthermore, a lower end portion of the lifting frame 343 may be inclined to
   correspond to an inclination angle of the blade protection cover 33.
             A depression portion 24 may be formed in a shape corresponding to a
   shape of the blade protection cover 33 on a bottom surface of the inner body 20,
 5 and an upper surface of the blade protection cover 33 may be received in and
   abutted against the depression 24 of the inner body 20 in a state where the height
   of the lifting frame 343 is adjusted to the uppermost position (see FIG. 3).
             The operation of the blade protection cover 33 and the like by a structure
   of the height adjusting unit 34 will be described.
10           The height adjusting unit 34 may be operated by the user's manual
   operation.
             When the user holds the handle portion 341c of the height adjusting lever
   341 to rotate it in one direction, the lever body 341 a rotates in a circumferential
   direction at an upper end of the receiving portion 23. The rotating protrusion
is portion 341a at a lower end of the lever body 341a and the coupling protrusion
   342a at an upper end of the rotating cylindrical portion 342 are engaged and
   coupled to each other so that the lever body 341a and the rotating cylindrical
   portion 342 rotate together. The height adjusting lever 341 and the rotating
   cylindrical portion 342 are restricted from being lowered by the lowering restriction
20 protrusion 342b of the rotating cylindrical portion 342 and rotated in place.
             Though the rotation of the lifting frame 343 is restricted by the rotation
   restricting protrusion 343a formed on an outer circumferential surface thereof, the
   spiral protrusion 343c formed on an inner circumferential surface of the lifting
   frame 343 is tooth-coupled with the rotation guide protrusion 342c formed on an
25 outer circumferential surface of the rotating cylindrical portion 342, and the lifting
                                              27

   frame 343 is lowered as the spiral protrusion 343c moves downward along the
   rotation guide protrusion 342c.
              When the handle portion 341c of the height adjusting lever 341 is rotated
   in an opposite direction, the lifting frame 343 is raised by the same principle as the
 5 lowering mechanism.
              The blade protection cover 33, the rotating plate 32, the blade 31 and the
   like coupled to a lower portion of the lifting frame 343 may be adjusted in height by
   lifting and lowering together with the lifting frame 343.
              FIG. 11 is an exploded view illustrating a lowering detection device of a
10 caster 40 according to the present disclosure, and FIG. 12 is a conceptual view
   illustrating a state in which the rotation shaft 41 is raised by the caster 40 of FIG.
   11 contacting the ground, and FIG. 13 is a conceptual view illustrating in which the
   rotating shaft 41 is lowered in a state where the caster 40 of FIG. 11 is caught on a
   cliff or the like, and floating in the air.
15            The lawn mower robot may be caught in a puddle or a cliff during driving
   and may cause the caster 40, which is a front wheel, not to touch the ground while
   floating in the air. In this case, in order to prevent the occurrence of a safety
   accident, a sensor unit for sensing whether the caster 40 does not touch the
   ground while floating in the air is provided on a bottom surface of the inner body
20 20. A control unit 80 receives a sensing signal from the sensor unit and stops the
   operation of the lawn mower robot while the caster 40 is floating in the air.
              The caster 40 is formed into a cylindrical shape. The caster 40 is pivotably
   provided at a front bottom surface of the inner body 20 through rotation shaft 41.
   One side of the rotation shaft 41 is coupled to a bottom surface of the inner body
25 20, and the other side of the rotation shaft 41 is coupled to a lateral center portion
                                                28

   of the caster 40.
            The rotation shaft 41 is formed into a circular bar shape. A vertical portion
   411 formed linearly at one side of the rotation shaft 41 is disposed perpendicular
   to the ground, and rotatably coupled to a bottom surface of the inner body 20
 5 through the shaft supporter 42. A supporter receiving portion 43 for receiving the
   shaft supporter 42 is formed on a bottom surface of the inner body 20.
            A plurality of lifting guide protrusions 431 are formed on the supporter
   receiving portion 43 to be spaced apart in a circumferential direction, and a
   plurality of lifting guide protrusions 431 guide the shaft supporter 42 so that the
10 shaft supporter 42 can move upward and downward.
            The shaft supporter 42 surrounds the vertical portion 411 of the rotation
   shaft 41, and supports the rotation shaft 41 so that the rotation shaft 41 is
   rotatable.
            The shaft supporter 42 may be formed in a cylindrical shape, and a
15 plurality of rotation preventing protrusions 421 may be formed on an outer
   circumferential surface of the shaft supporter 42 to be circumferentially spaced
   apart from each other, and the plurality of rotation preventing protrusions 421 may
   be inserted between the lifting guide protrusion 431 of the supporter receiving
   portion 43 to move the shaft supporter 42 upward and downward.
20          The shaft supporter 42 has an insertion hole 422a and a coupling hole
   422b therein. The insertion hole 422a is formed on a bottom surface of the shaft
   supporter 42 to be perpendicular to an inside thereof to insert the vertical portion
   411 of the rotation shaft 41 through the insertion hole 422a. The coupling hole
   422b is formed so that a diameter of the coupling hole 422b becomes narrower
25 from an upper end of the insertion hole 422a in a straight upward direction. A
                                              29

   coupling groove portion 411a is formed at an upper end of the vertical portion 411
   of the rotation shaft 41 to have a small diameter. When the vertical portion 411 of
   the rotation shaft 41 is inserted through the insertion hole 422a at a lower portion
   of the shaft supporter 42, only the coupling groove portion 411a on the vertical
 5 portion 411 of the rotation shaft 41 is inserted into the coupling hole 422b, and part
   of the remaining vertical portion 411 excluding the coupling groove portion 411a is
   received and coupled to the insertion hole 422a.
            Furthermore, at an upper end of the shaft supporter 42, a support groove
   422c is formed to be larger in diameter than the insertion hole 422a and concave
10 in a downward direction.
            A release preventing member 423 is mounted on an upper end portion of
   the vertical portion 411 of the rotation shaft 41. A coupling groove 411 b is formed
   to have a small diameter at an upper end of the coupling groove portion 411a of
   the rotation shaft 41, and a hole is formed at a center portion of the release
is preventing member 423 to allow the coupling groove 411b of the rotation axis 41
   to pass therethrough, and the release preventing member 423 is inserted into the
   coupling groove 411 b so that an upper end of the rotation shaft 41 is caught by the
   release preventing member 423, thereby preventing the rotation shaft 41 from
   being released in a downward direction by gravity from the shaft supporter 42.
20          A height restricting portion 432 is formed at an upper end portion of the
   supporter receiving portion 43. The height restricting portion 432 is disposed at an
   upper portion of the shaft supporter 42 to block the shaft supporter 42 and the
   vertical portion 411 of the rotation shaft 41 from being raised. As a result, the
   maximum rising height is restricted when the shaft supporter 42 and the vertical
25 portion 411 of the rotation shaft 41 are raised within the supporter receiving portion
                                              30

   43.
            A bracket 433 is mounted on at lower end portion of the supporter
   receiving portion 43. A bracket coupling groove may be formed in a shape
   corresponding to the bracket 433 at a lower end of the supporter receiving portion
 5 43. The bracket 433 is received and coupled to the bracket coupling groove, and
   an edge portion of the bracket 433 is fastened to the supporter receiving portion
   43 by a plurality of screws. A shaft support hole through which the vertical portion
   411 of the rotation shaft 41 passes is formed, and a shaft support portion 433a
   that is bent downward from the shaft support hole of the bracket 433 is provided at
10 a center portion of the bracket 433 to surround the vertical portion 411 of the
   rotation shaft 41 and rotatably support the vertical portion 411 of the rotating shaft
   41. The bracket 433 is configured to limit a minimum height of the shaft supporter
   42 when the shaft supporter 42 is lowered.
            A caster coupling portion 412 is formed in a "T-"   shape on the other side
15 of the rotation shaft 41. An end portion of the caster coupling portion 412 is
   coupled to a center portion of the caster 40 through a bearing so that the caster 40
   is rotatably supported by the rotation shaft 41. The end portion of the caster
   coupling portion 412 of the rotation shaft 41 is formed eccentrically to one side
   from the vertical portion 411 of the rotation shaft 41 so that the caster 40 can pivot
20 about the vertical portion 411 of the rotation shaft 41 along a trajectory having a
   predetermined curvature.
            The lowering protrusion 424 may protrude from an upper end portion of an
   outer circumferential surface of the shaft supporter 42. The lowering protrusion
   424 moves upward and downward together with the shaft supporter 42.
25          A drop switch 44 is provided at one side of the supporter receiving portion
                                              31

   43 to detect whether the shaft supporter 42 is lowered. The drop switch 44 has a
   rectangular shaped switch body 441, a switch operation lever 442 coupled in an
   inclined manner to one side of the switch body 441 with a hinge structure, and a
   contact portion 443 protruding from the switch operation lever. At this time, the
 5 switch operation lever 442 is elastically supported by the switch body 441.
            The drop switch 44 is vertically disposed at one side of the supporter
   receiving portion 43, and the switch operation lever 442 is disposed to face the
   lowering protrusion 424, and the contact portion 443 is disposed in contact with a
   lower portion of the lowering protrusion 424. The drop switch 44 generates an
10 electrical signal for turning off an internal contact of the switch operation lever 442
   when a pushing force is received from the lowering protrusion 424, and turning off
   the internal contact when the pushing force is released.
            The inner body 20 is lowered by its own weight when the caster 40 is in
   contact with the ground, and the shaft supporter 42 is brought into contact with the
is height restricting portion 432 formed at an upper portion of the supporter receiving
   portion 43, and the vertical portion 41 of the rotation shaft supports a load of the
   inner body 20 through the shaft supporter 42. The vertical portion 411 of the
   rotation shaft 41 rises together with the shaft supporter 42 with respect to a
   receiving portion of the inner body 20.
20          If a front portion of the inner body 20 falls into a cliff or the like and the
   caster 40 is floating in the air, then the caster 40 and the rotation shaft 41 are
   lowered by gravity. The shaft supporter 42 coupled to the vertical portion 411 of
   the rotation shaft 41 is lowered while the lowering protrusion 424 is also lowered.
            The lowering protrusion 424 is brought into contact with the contact
25 portion 443 to pressurize the contact portion 443 toward the switch body 441 when
                                               32

   moving downward, and push the switch operation lever 442 toward the switch
   body 441, and thus the internal contact of the switch body 441 generates an ON
   signal. As a result, the control unit 80 receives a sensing signal from the drop
   switch 44 to sense whether the caster 40 falls into a cliff or the like and is in a
 5 floating state, and stop the driving of the wheel 50 and the operation of the blade
   31.
            FIG. 14 is a conceptual view illustrating a state in which a wheel driving
   unit 51 as viewed from the bottom of FIG. 1 is mounted between the wheel 50 and
   the inner body 20, and FIG. 15 is an exploded view illustrating the wheel driving
10 unit 51 of FIG. 14, and FIG. 16 is an enlarged exploded view illustrating a structure
   in which the wheel driving unit 51 is fastened in FIG. 15.
            The wheel driving unit 51 is mounted on both sides of the inner body 20,
   respectively, to drive the wheel 50.
            A wheel driving unit receiving hole 53 is formed at the rear side on both
15 side surfaces of the inner body 20.
            The wheel driving unit 51 includes a drive motor and a power transmission
   gear 522. The drive motor includes a stator and a rotor, and a device configured to
   receive power from a battery to generate a rotational force by an electromagnetic
   interaction between the stator and the rotor.
20          The power transmission gear 522 is mechanically connected to the drive
   motor and configured to receive power from the drive motor and reduce a
   rotational speed of the motor so as to transmit an increased torque to the wheel 50.
   The power transmission gear 522 may include a planetary gear set such as a sun
   gear, a planetary gear, a ring gear, and a carrier.
25          The drive motor and the power transmission gear 522 may be received in

   gear may be selectively applied to the power transmission gear 522. In order to
   accommodate both the drive motor and the power transmission gear 522, a
   housing 52 may be formed in a cylindrical shape having a relatively long length
 5 compared to the diameter.
            The rotation shaft 523 may be formed to protrude in an axial direction from
   one side of the housing 52. One side of the rotation shaft 523 is connected to the
   power transmission gear 522, and the other side of the rotation shaft 523 is
   connected to the wheel 50 to transmit a rotational force transmitted from the power
10 transmission gear 522 to the wheel 50. The power transmission gear 522 receives
   a rotational force of the drive motor, reduces a rotational speed by the gear ratio,
   increases the torque, and transmits the increased torque to the wheel 50 through
   the rotation shaft 523.
            Part of the housing 52 may be received in the inner body 20 through the
15 wheel driving unit receiving hole 53. One side of the inner body 20 may be formed
   by bending a bending portion 531 protruding outward from the wheel driving unit
   receiving hole 53 along a circumferential direction, thereby supporting part of the
   housing 52 received through the wheel driving unit receiving hole 53.
            A housing supporter 54 is provided to mount the housing 52 on both sides
20 of the inner body 20 while part of the housing 52 is received in the inner body 20.
            The housing supporter 54 includes a housing coupling portion 541 and a
   flange portion 542.
            The housing coupling portion 541 is formed in a cylindrical shape to
   surround an outer circumferential surface of the housing 52. A housing space
25 capable of receiving part of the housing 52 is formed within the housing coupling
                                             34

   portion 541. In addition, one side of the housing coupling portion 541 may be open
   to insert part of the housing 52 into the housing coupling portion 541 through the
   opening portion. A hole is formed at a center portion of the other side of the
   housing coupling part 541 to allow the rotation shaft 523 to pass therethrough.
 5 One end portion of the housing 52 is fastened to the other side of the housing
   coupling portion 541 with a bolt while being housed inside the housing engaging
   portion 541.
            The flange portion 542 is formed in a rectangular plate shape, and
   disposed vertically at one end portion of the housing coupling portion 541.
10 Fastening holes for fastening a bolt 55 are formed at the corner portions of the
   flange portion 542, respectively.
            A plurality of ribs 542a may be provided at one side of the flange portion
   542 to increase coupling strength between the flange portion 542 and the housing
   coupling portion 541. The plurality of ribs 542a may be spaced apart from each
15 other in a circumferential direction of the housing coupling portion 541. The
   plurality of ribs 542a may be formed in a right triangular plate shape. One side (a
   bottom side a rectangle) of each rib 542a is coupled to one side surface of the
   flange portion 542, and the other side (a height side of a rectangle) of each rib
   542a is coupled to an outer circumferential surface of the housing coupling portion
20 541.
            A spacer 542b may be formed on the other side surface of the flange
   portion 542 along a circumferential direction. The spacer 542b may reinforce the
   strength of the flange portion 542 while maintaining an interval between the flange
   portions 542 to be constant from a side surface of the inner body 20.
25          A fastening portion 532 for fastening a corner portion of the flange portion
                                             35

   542 is formed to protrude from a side surface of the inner body 20. The fastening
   portion 532 may be formed in a cylindrical tube shape, and a plurality of
   reinforcing ribs 532a may be formed on an outer circumferential surface of the
   fastening portion 532. The plurality of reinforcing ribs 532a may be spaced apart
 5 from each other by three at an interval of 90 degrees along a circumferential
   direction at an upper portion of each fastening portion 532. A fastening hole for
   fastening a bolt 55 is formed within the fastening portion 532.
            Each of a plurality of bolts 55 may be fastened to the fastening portion 532
   formed on the side surface of the inner body 20 through the fastening hole formed
10 at an edge of the flange portion 542, thereby obtaining a secure fastening
   between the flange portion 542 and the inner body 20.
            A plurality of guide portions 543 may protrude from the other side surface
   of the flange portion 542 toward a side surface of the inner body 20. The plurality
   of guide portions 543 may be formed in a semicircular curved shape to surround a
15 lower outer circumferential surface of the fastening portion 532. As a result, it may
   be possible to increase the fastening strength of the fastening portion 532.
            According to the configuration of the wheel driving unit 51, the drive motor
   and the power transmission gear 522 are received in one housing 52 and
   modularized into one module, and the wheel driving unit 51 in which the drive
20 motor and the power transmission gear 522 are modularized is fastened to the
   inner body 20 through the housing supporter 54, thereby having an advantage that
   it is convenient to replace different types of gears even when a plastic gear or
   metal gear is selectively applied thereto.
            FIG. 17 is a plan view illustrating an appearance of a lawn mower robot
25 according to the present disclosure, and FIG. 18 is a side view of FIG. 17, and FIG.
                                              36

   19 is a perspective view illustrating a state in which a first and a second cover 14
   are open in FIG. 17.
            The outer cover 10 of the lawn mower robot according to the present
   disclosure is formed in a rounded or inclined manner so that there is no recessed
 5 shape not to allow water (rain) or dust to be piled up or accumulated on an upper
   portion thereof. The first cover 11 is rotatably mounted on an upper portion of the
   outer cover 10, and a front end portion of the first cover 11 is hinge-coupled so
   that a rear end portion of the first cover 11 is rotatable up and down. A cover
   coupling portion 12 to which the first cover 11 is coupled is provided on the outer
10 cover 10, and the cover coupling portion 12 is formed concave downward along an
   edge portion of the first cover 11, and thus the cover coupling portion 12 may be
   configured to partition outer and the inner side space of the outer cover 10 from an
   upper portion of the outer cover 10. The cover coupling portion 12 is formed in a
   shape corresponding to the first cover 11, and disposed to cover part of an upper
is portion of the inner body 20.
            A first opening portion 12a communicating with the height adjusting lever
   341 is provided on the cover coupling portion 12 to operate the height adjusting
   lever 341. The first cover 11 is configured to open and close an upper portion of
   the cover coupling portion 12 and the first opening 12a. When the first cover 11 is
20 open, the user may rotate the height adjusting lever 341 to adjust the height of the
   blade 31 or the like. The indicator 341d is formed adjacent to an upper end of the
   receiving portion of the inner body 20 in the vicinity of the height adjusting lever
   341, and part of a scale shown on the height adjusting lever 341 corresponds to a
   triangle vertex of the indicator 341d, and thus a numerical value of the
25 corresponding scale becomes the height of the blade 31.
                                              37

   rear end portion of the first cover 11 at an upper portion of the outer cover 10 to
   allow the user to press the pressing portion 111. A locking protrusion 112 is formed
   on a lower surface of the pressing portion 111, and a locking groove is formed on
 5 the cover coupling portion 12 at a position corresponding to the locking protrusion
   112, and thus when the pressing portion 111 is pressed once, the locking
   protrusion 112 may be released to open the first cover 11. When the first cover 11
   is closed, it may be locked by coupling of the locking protrusion 112 to the locking
   groove. A spring 623 is provided between the first cover 11 and the cover coupling
10 portion 12 so that the first cover 11 can be open by an elastic force of the spring
   623. A damper may be provided between the first cover 11 and the cover coupling
   portion 12 to smoothly open the first cover 11 at a constant speed by the damper.
            An emergency stop switch 13 may be installed at a rear side of the first
   cover 11 to allow a pressing operation in an upward and downward direction.
15 When the emergency stop switch 13 is pressed by the user in an emergency, an
   ON signal is generated to stop the operation of the wheel 50 and the blade 31.

            Charging terminals 91 are provided at an upper portion of the charging
   stand 90 to charge a battery of the lawn mower robot through the charging
   terminals 91 when the lawn mower robot enters the charging stand 90.
            The charging terminals 15 of the outer cover 10 may be formed to
20 protrude beyond the outer cover 10 by a predetermined height or more to avoid
   interference with the charging stand 90. The charging terminals 91 of the charging

                                              39

   a right end of the charging stand 90 may be spaced within a predetermined range
   when the lawn mower robot enters the charging stand 90. The spring 623 type
   charging terminals 91 of the charging stand 90 are formed in an elongated manner
   in a front-rear direction while maintaining a constant width at an upper portion of
 5 the charging stand 90 so that the charging terminals 15 of the outer cover 10 are
   brought into contact with the charging terminals 91 of the charging stand 90 even
   when a distance between the outer cover 10 and the charging stand 90 is
   changed.
            A docking wire 92 is connected to front and rear ends of the charging
10 stand 90, and the docking wire 92 is a device for guiding the lawn mower robot to
   enter the charging stand 90 with a predetermined distance. The lawn mower robot
   may be provided with a coil sensor at a front side of the inner body 20 to sense the
   docking wire 92. The coil sensor senses the position of the docking wire 92 to
   allow the lawnmower robot to enter the charging stand 90 with a predetermined
15 distance.
            Infrared rays may be irradiated from the charging stand 90 toward the
   lawn mower robot to make an efficient contact between the charging terminals 15
   of the lawn mower robot and the charging terminals 91 of the charging stand 90.
            An IR transmitting window 93 and an IR transmitting sensor for irradiating
20 infrared rays may be installed at one side of the charging stand 90 to detect the
   position of the lawn mower robot. The IR transmitting window 93 of the charging
   stand 90 is made of a light transmitting material, and infrared rays be irradiated to
   the lawn mower robot through the IR transmitting window 93 when the IR
   transmitting sensor generates infrared rays. The irradiation direction (irradiation
25 angle) of the IR transmitting sensor may be irradiated to the robot with respect to
                                             40

   the docking wire 92 at a predetermined inclination angle, for example, 30 degrees
   (see FIGS. 22A and 22B).
            The IR receiving window 16a is formed on a front surface of the outer
   cover 10 to transmit infrared rays irradiated from the IR transmitting window 93.
 5 The IR receiving window 16a is formed in an elongated manner in the right
   direction from a longitudinal center line of the outer cover 10, and located close to
   the charging stand 90. The IR receiving sensor 17a may be disposed at a rear
   side of the IR receiving window 16a to sense infrared rays transmitted through the
   IR receiving window 16a so as to sense the position of the charging stand 90. The
10 IR receiving sensor 17a may sense the position of the charging stand 90 through
   infrared rays so that the charging terminal 15 of the outer cover 10 can be brought
   into contact with the charging terminals 91 of the charging stand 90.
            The IR receiving window 16b is formed at a rear center portion of the outer
   cover 10 to transmit infrared rays irradiated from the IR transmitting window 93.
15 The IR receiving sensor 17b is disposed at a front side of the IR receiving window
   16b to sense infrared rays transmitted through the IR receiving window 16b so as
   to sense that the lawn mower robot has passed the charging stand 90.
             FIG. 23 is a conceptual view illustrating an ultrasonic sensor 18 installed
   at a front side of the outer cover 10.
20          The lawn mower robot has a plurality of ultrasonic sensors 18 capable of
   sensing an obstacle in the front in order to avoid collision with the obstacle. The
   plurality of ultrasonic sensors 18 are installed on a front surface of the outer cover
   10 to transmit ultrasonic waves toward the front of the outer cover 10 and receive
   ultrasonic waves reflected from an obstacle to sense the obstacle. The control unit
25 80 receives a sensing signal from the ultrasonic sensor 18 to sense an obstacle in
                                             41

   the front, and controls the drive motor 521 of the wheel 50 to reduce the driving
   speed of the lawn mower to avoid collision with the obstacle.
            However, ultrasonic waves may be reflected by grass as well as the
   obstacle located in front of the outer cover 10 when driving the lawnmower robot,
 5 and thus the ultrasonic sensor 18 may recognize the grass to be cut as an
   obstacle. As a result, it causes a problem that the grass cutting robot stops in front
   of the grass to be cut according to the sensing signal of the ultrasonic sensor 18
   not to cut the grass.
            Therefore, in order to solve this problem, it is necessary to limit a
10 downward irradiation angle of ultrasonic waves not to irradiate ultrasonic waves to
   the grass at a predetermined height or less from the ground.
            To this end, an ultrasonic guide unit 181 is provided in front of the outer
   cover 10. The ultrasonic guide part 181 is formed to be recessed backward while
   maintaining a constant height from a front end portion of the outer cover 10.
15          The ultrasonic guide unit 181       includes a horizontal surface 181a
   horizontally formed at a preset height from an upper end of a front end portion of
   the outer cover 10. The horizontal plane 181a may be located at a height
   corresponding to the installation position of the ultrasonic sensor 18. As a result,
   ultrasonic waves propagate over the horizontal plane 181a without propagating
20 below the horizontal surface 181a to limit a downward propagation angle of the
   ultrasonic waves.
            There should be no structure above the horizontal surface 181a. It is
   because when there is a structure above the horizontal surface 181a, ultrasonic
   waves may be reflected by the structure and propagate below the horizontal plane
25 181a.
                                             42

            The ultrasonic guide unit 181 has a mounting surface 181 b. The mounting
   surface 181 b may be formed to intersect in an upward direction from a rear end of
   the horizontal surface 181 a. A plurality of ultrasonic sensors 18 may be embedded
   in the mounting surface 181b. The ultrasonic waves may propagate forward and
 5 upward by the mounting surface 181b and the horizontal surface 181a. The
   plurality of ultrasonic sensors 18 may be disposed to be spaced apart from each
   other along the mounting surface 181 b.
            The ultrasonic guide unit 181 has side surface portions 181 c formed to be
   inclined at both side ends of the mounting surface 181 b. The side surface portions
10 181c are formed so as to be inclined to increase a distance between the side
   surface portions 181c as they go toward the front side on the mounting surface
   181b. The side surface portions 181c are configured to limit a lateral propagation
   angle of ultrasonic waves generated from the ultrasonic sensor 18. As a result, it
   may be possible to prevent ultrasonic waves from being spread unnecessarily
is wide.
            A battery may be mounted inside the inner body 20. An electrical
   component mounted on the outer cover 10, such as an ultrasonic sensor 18, is
   electrically connected to the battery to receive power from the battery.
            To this end, a withdrawal hole 191 for drawing a wire from the front to the
20 outside of the inner body 20 may be formed at a front side of the inner body 20. A
   rubber stopper 19 for fixing the wire drawn out through the withdrawal hole 191
   may be provided in the withdrawal hole 191. A wire protection cover 192
   protruding forward and upward from a front surface of the inner body 20 may be
   provided. A front surface of the lower portion of the wire protection cover 192 may
25 clogged and opened upward. The wire drawn out through the withdrawal hole 191
                                              43

   may connect the battery to the ultrasonic sensor 18 or the like.

   having a flat shape, and a contact is provided inside the switch body 751. One
   side of the switch operation lever 752 is fixed to one side corner portion of the
   switch body 751 so that one side thereof can be interlocked with a contact inside
   the switch body 751, and the other side thereof is separated from the switch body
 5 751 and inclined in a direction facing the protrusion portion 711a of the first
   support portion 711. A contact portion 753 is formed to protrude from an end of the
   switch operation lever 752. The contact portion 753 is disposed on an up-and
   down movement line of the protruding portion 711 a.
            The protrusion portion 711a of the first support portion 711 moves in an
10 upward direction when the support portion body 71 is raised by lifting the outer
   cover 10. At this time, the switch operation lever 752 may be pressurized toward
   the switch body 751 and an internal contact of the switch body 751 may be turned
   on while the contact portion 753 is brought into contact with the protrusion portion
   711a, and thus the cover lifting detection sensor 75 may be able to sense that the
is outer cover 10 is in the lifted state. When the outer cover 10 is lowered to its
   original position, the protrusion portion 711a of the first support portion 711 is
   lowered. At this time, the switch operation lever 752 moves to its original position,
   and the internal contact of the switch body 751 is turned off while the contact
   portion 753 is separated from the protrusion portion 711 a, thereby sensing that the
20 cover is in an unlifted state.   When the outer cover 10 senses that the outer cover
   10 is in a lifted state, the control unit 80 controls the drive motor 521 of the wheel
   50 and the drive motor 30 of the blade 31 to stop the driving of the wheel 50 and
   the blade 31.
            In addition, a tilt detection sensor 76 may be provided in consideration of
25 an emergency situation. The tilt detection sensor 76 may be mounted on the inner
                                               51

   body 20 to sense an inclination of the inner body 20. The control unit 80 may stop
   the operation of the lawn mower robot when it receives a sensing signal from the
   tilt detection sensor 76 and the tilt angle exceeds a predetermined tilt angle. For
   example, the lawn mower robot may be turned over when the uphill slope gradient
 5 is steep, and thus the control unit 80 may sense it in advance to stop the operation
   of the wheel 50 and the blade 31.
             FIG. 27 is a block diagram illustrating a control flow of a lawn mower robot
   according to the present disclosure.

is sensor mounted on the outer cover 10, and a drop switch 44, a cover lifting
   detection sensor 75, a tilt detection sensor 76, and a hall sensor mounted on the
   inner body 20.
             The ultrasonic sensor 18 is mounted in front of the outer cover 10 to sense
   an obstacle above a predetermined height.
20           The IR receiving sensors are respectively positioned on the front and rear
   surfaces of the outer cover 10 to sense the position of the charging stand 90.
             The drop switch 44 senses whether the caster 40 is floating in the air and
   lowered with respect to the inner body 20.
             The cover lifting detection sensor 75 senses whether the outer cover 10 is
25 lifted or not.
                                               52

            The tilt detection sensor 76 senses an inclination of the inner body 20.
            The hall sensor 626 senses whether or not the outer cover 10 and the
   obstacle collide with each other by interaction with a magnet.
