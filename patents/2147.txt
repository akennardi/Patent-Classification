                                       FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]     The present disclosure is directed, at least in part, to a suture, the suture comprising a non
load bearing core and a load bearing sheath surrounding the non-load bearing core. The suture of the
present invention exhibits superior knot tying and knot security properties.
                                 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0002]     There are many circumstances in which sutures are used to repair tissue, attach tissue to a
correct anatomical position or to close a wound. In many instances, a suture loop is closed by
multiple knots. To prevent slippage of the suture, multiple knots, 7 or 8 knots, must be made one
after the other. This results in a large number of knots which is time consuming for the surgeon. It
can also result in a large mass of suture material which can cause irritations and inflammation or
injure the cartilage layer of a joint. Accordingly, in an aspect, the present invention provides a
braided suture with superior knot-tying characteristics.
                               BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

the osmotically active substances can also be embedded within the non-load bearing core so to
improve handling and to further influence the kinetics of osmosis.
          B.      A Load Bearing Sheath
[0032]       In an exemplary embodiment, the load bearing sheath of the present invention comprises a
second biocompatible polymer. In other embodiments, the load bearing sheath is formed from a
plurality of yarns, each yam in the form of mono or multifilament of the second biocompatible
polymer.
[0033]       In some embodiments, the second biocompatible polymer comprises a polyolefin. In
another embodiment, the polyolefin is polyethylene. In one embodiment, the polyethylene has a
weight average molecular weight ranging from 500,000 g/mole to 5,000,000 gram/mole. In another
embodiment, the polyethylene has a weight average molecular weight ranging from 1,000,000
g/mole to 5,000,000 gram/mole.
[0034]       In some embodiments, the load bearing sheath is formed from a plurality of yarns. In
some such embodiments, each yarn has a tenacity at break value ranging from: 30 cN/dtex to 45
cN/dtex; or 35 cN/dtex to 45 cN/dtex. In some other such embodiments, each yarn has a tenacity at

[0035]       In some embodiments, the plurality of yarns are braided to form the load bearing sheath.
In some such embodiments, the number of yams included in the braid range from 10 to 32. In some
other such embodiments, the number of yarns included in the braid range from 10 to 20. In some yet
other such embodiments, the number of yarns included in the braid range from 15 to 20. In some
embodiments, the braid can have a pick count per inch ranging from 60 to 90 pic counts per inch.
          D.       Suture Characteristics and Method of Use
[0036]       The suture, of the present invention, can be characterized by a variety of physical
properties. In one embodiment, the suture has a tensile strength value ranging from: 100 N to 400 N;
250 N to 400 N; or 300 N to 400 N. In some embodiments, the suture diameter is deformed in a
                                                      6
3537340vl

uniform manner upon application of a radial deformation force. In some such embodiments, the
suture is deformed into a circular shape having a diameter less than the original suture diameter. In
some such embodiments, the suture diameter is reduced by up to 40%. In some other such
embodiments, the suture diameter is reduced by 5 % to 40%. In some other embodiments, the suture
is deformed in a non-uniform manner upon application of a radial deformation force. In some such
embodiments, the suture is deformed into an elliptical shape. In some such embodiments, the suture
diameter is reduced by up to 40%. In some other such embodiments, the suture diameter is reduced
by 5 % to 40%.
[0037]     A need exists for sutures capable of forming surgical knots that are as small as possible by
reducing the number and close to the joints to prevent excessive tissue reaction when absorbable
sutures are used, or to minimize foreign body reaction to non-absorbable sutures. Also, a suture can
form a knot whose ends could be cut as short as possible without the risk of slippage and/or the knot
becoming untied advantageously minimize irritations and inflammations or and/or injury to
surrounding tissue (cartilage layer of a joint, for example). The suture of the present invention is
particularly useful for this purpose as illustrated in the examples.
[0038]     The suture of the present invention address one or more of these needs by having superior
knot tying and knot security properties, permitting surgeons to execute accurate surgical wound
closures more rapidly (by tying fewer knots, for example) with minimal risk the knots slipping or
becoming untied, while also minimizing and/or preventing hemorrhage and exogenous microbial
infections. In particular, the sutures may be used for applications involving fixation of soft tissue to
bone, soft tissue to soft tissue or holding soft tissue in approximation.
[0039]     While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is the non-load bearing core of the present
suture acts as a "soft core" takes none or a very small part of the load when the suture is in use whilst
the braid takes the majority of the load. Thus, when a surgeon ties knots in the suture to block the
suture (i.e. prevent the knots from untying or loosening), the soft core collapses and/or becomes
squashed. As a result the knots have an increased contact area at the crossing points, which has a net
effect of increasing the friction in the knot. This in turn allows the surgeon to block sutures with
minimal number of knots (with as few as two or three knots in some cases).
[0040]     The suture, of the present invention, has improved knot tying properties and may be used
in methods to reduce knot slippage. In some embodiments, the suture comprises a non-load bearing
                                                      7
3537340vl

core and a load bearing sheath surrounding the non-load bearing core, wherein the suture has an
improved knot slippage number when tied with at least six knots compared to a suture comprising a
load bearing core surrounded by a load bearing sheath.
E.        Figures
[0041]      Figures 1A-ID illustrate four cross-sectional views of an exemplary suture 100 of the
present invention. In Figure 1A, the non-load bearing core 110 is surrounded by a load bearing
sheath made of 20 braided yarns 120. In Figure IB, the non-load bearing core 110 is surrounded by
a load bearing sheath made of 20 braided yams wherein the suture has been deformed in a uniform
manner to reduce the suture diameter. In Figure 1C, the non-load bearing core 110 is surrounded by
a load bearing sheath made of 20 braided yams wherein the suture has been deformed to an elliptical
shape. In Figure ID, the non-load bearing core 110 is surrounded by a load bearing sheath made of
20 braided yams wherein the suture has been deformed in a non-uniform manner in the radial
direction to reduce the diameter by up to 40%.

bearing sheath in a braided structure.

Examples
[0044]       Prior Art Yam: The knot slippage number of a prior art Polyester braided suture for a loop
of six knots, for example, a six throw square knot, was determined by measuring displacement
versus tensile load. For the purposes of this application knot slippage is defined as [(Displacement
at maximum force - Displacement for the last distance of no knot slippage) +(Displacement at
maximum force)]x 100. In Figure 4, the Displacement at maximum force occurred at 16.8 mm
(400), the Displacement for the last distance of no knot slippage occurred at 5.1 mm (410) for a knot
slippage number of 69.64 %.
[0045]      The knot slippage numbers of a loop made of seven knots, for example, a seven throw
square knot, using the same suture as in Figure 4 was measured as described above. In Figure 5, the
                                                     8
3537340vl

Displacement at maximum force occurred at 9.3 mm (500), the Displacement for the last distance of
no knot slippage occurred at 9.3 mm (510) for a knot slippage number of 0 %.
[0046]     The knot slippage numbers for two prior art sutures (Ethibond & FiberWire) was measured
as described above. The data is illustrated graphically in the bar graph of Figure 7 and tabulated in
Table 1.
[0047]     Inventive Example: The knot slippage numbers of a loop made of six knots, for example, a
six throw square knot, using an exemplary suture of the present invention was measured as described
above. In Figure 6, the Displacement at maximum force occurred at 9.5 mm (600), the
Displacement for the last distance of no knot slippage occurred at 9.5 mm (610) for a knot slippage
number of 0 %.
[0048]     The knot slippage numbers for an exemplary suture of the present invention (Suture with
Soft Core) was measured as described above. The data is illustrated graphically in the bar graph of
Figure 7 and tabulated in Table 1. When used to tie six (6) knots, the three sutures, for prior art
suture and the exemplary suture, illustrated knot slippage numbers ranging from 12.32 % to 42.98
%. However, when used to tie seven or eight knots, the exemplary sutures of the present invention
illustrated reduced knot slippage numbers, 3.03 % to 3.16 %, compared to the knots made using
prior art sutures, 10.18 % to 17.88 %.
