                                         Abstract
This invention consist of a pool made of inflatable and waterproof fiber based airbags,
that floats on any body of water, as the upper reservoir of an pumped hydro energy
storage, while the lower reservoir is the respective body of water. The floating pool is
connected to the body of water through a pipe and a reversible pump turbine, that
while in pumping mode is powered by floating solar photovoltaic devices and stores
energy, while in turbine mode generates power when water falls back from the pool to
the respective body of water.

        This invention consist of a pool made of inflatable and waterproof fiber based airbags, that floats on any
body of water, as the upper reservoir of an pumped hydro energy storage, while the lower reservoir is the
respective body of water. The floating pool is connected to the body of water through a pipe and a reversible
pump turbine, that while in pumping mode is powered by floating solar photovoltaic devices and stores energy,
while in turbine mode generates power when water falls back from the pool to the respective body of water.
        The animation below is for a prototype build from rubber airbags, similar to a 5m high and 160 cubic
meters capacity inflatable energy storage pool that can store 12 kWh, with 40 sqm floating solar generation
panels.
