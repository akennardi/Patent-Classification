                                   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            The present invention relates to substituted pyrazoles compounds useful as
    N-type calcium channel blockers. More particularly, the present invention relates to
 5  substituted pyrazole compounds useful as N-type calcium channel blockers and
    methods of preparation and use thereof.
                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 0O         Calcium ions play a fundamental role in the physiology and biochemistry of
    organisms and of cells. The entry of calcium into cells through ion channels
    mediates a variety of cellular and physiological responses, including gene
    expression, signal transduction, neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction and
    hormone secretion. Ion channels are classified by gating, or what opens and closes
25  the channel to the flux of ions. Voltage-gated ion channels open or close depending
    on the voltage gradient across the plasma membrane, whereas ligand-gated ion
    channels open or close depending on the binding of ligands to the channel. The
    classification of voltage-gated calcium channels divides them into three groups: (i)
    high voltage-activated channels, which include L-, N-, P- and Q-type channels; (ii)
30  intermediate voltage-activated R-type channels; and (iii) low voltage activated T-type
    channels.
            The N-type calcium channel is distributed mainly in central and peripheral
                                                  1

   neurons, being localized primarily to presynaptic nerve terminals. This channel
   regulates the calcium flux required for depolarization-evoked release of
   neurotransmitters from synaptic endings. The transmission of pain signals from the
   periphery to the central nervous system (CNS) is mediated, inter alia, by N-type
 5 calcium channels located in the spinal cord. Inhibition of the N-type calcium channel
   in the superficial dorsal horn leads to a decrease in membrane excitability and
   neurotransmitter release, resulting in pain relief. In addition, knock-out mice lacking
   the N-type calcium channel exhibit reduced nociceptive behaviors in animal models
   of pain.
 0
           N-type calcium channels have been shown to mediate the development and
   maintenance of the neuronal sensitization processes associated with neuropathic
   pain and therefore provide attractive targets for the development of analgesic drugs.
   Three N-type calcium channel modulators are currently approved for the treatment of
 5 pain: o-conotoxin MVIIA (ziconotide), marketed as Prialt@, potently and selectively
   blocks the N-type calcium channel and is indicated for the management of severe
   chronic pain; gabapentin, marketed as Neurontin@, and pregabalin, marketed as
   Lyrica@, bind with high affinity to the U26 subunit of the N-type calcium channel and
   are indicated for the treatment of fibromyalgia, diabetic nerve pain and/or post
 0 herpetic neuralgia pain.
                               SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

 5  "effective amount" as used herein, means that amount of each active compound or
    pharmaceutical agent, alone or in combination, that elicits the biological or medicinal
    response in a tissue system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher,
    veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the
    symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated. For prophylactic purposes (i.e.,
 0  inhibiting the progression of a disorder), the term "therapeutically effective amount"
    refers to that amount of each active compound or pharmaceutical agent, alone or in
    combination, that treats or inhibits in a subject the progression of a disorder as being
    sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. Thus, the

    therapeutic or prophylactic when administered in combination with the second or
    additional drugs according to the invention; or (c) both (or more) drugs are
 '0 administered in an amount that is sub-therapeutic or sub-prophylactic if administered
    alone, but are therapeutic or prophylactic when administered together. The effective
    amount of said compound is from about 0.001 mg/kg/day to about 300 mg/kg/day.
            Advantageously, the effective amount of a combination product for treating an
25  N-type calcium channel mediated disorder may be a reduced amount of either or
    both the compound or therapeutic agent compared to the effective amount of the
    compound or therapeutic agent otherwise recommended for treating thecondition.
    Therefore, it is contemplated that the compound is administered to the subject
    before, during or after the time the agent is administered.

            The compounds of the invention may be present in the form of
    pharmaceutically acceptable salts. For use in medicines, the "pharmaceutically
 5  acceptable salts" of the compounds of this invention refer to non-toxic acidic/anionic
    or basic/cationic salt forms.
            Suitable salt forms include acid addition salts which may, for example, be
    formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a
 '0 solution of an acid such as acetic acid, adipic acid, benzoic acid, carbonic acid, citric
    acid, fumaric acid, glycolic acid, hydrochloric acid, maleic acid, malonic acid,
    phosphoric acid, saccharinic acid, succinic acid, sulphuric acid, tartaric acid,
    trifluoroacetic acid and the like.
25           Furthermore when the compounds of the present invention carry an acidic
    moiety, suitable salts thereof may include alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium or
    potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium or magnesium salts; and
    salts formed with suitable organic ligands, e.g. quaternary ammonium salts.
30           During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present
    invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive
    groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of
    conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in
                                                 48

   P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis,       3 rd Edition, John Wiley &
   Sons, 1999. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent
   stage using methods known in the art. The scope of the present invention
 5 encompasses all such protected compound forms and mixtures thereof.
           The invention includes compounds of various isomers and mixtures thereof.
   The term "isomer" refers to compounds that have the same composition and
   molecular weight but differ in physical and/or chemical properties. Such substances
 0 have the same number and kind of atoms but differ in structure. The structural
   difference may be in constitution (geometric isomers) or in an ability to rotate the
   plane of polarized light (optical isomers).
           The term "stereoisomer" refers to isomers that have the same molecular
 5 formula and the same sequence of covalently bonded atoms but a different spatial
   orientation.
           The term "optical isomer" means isomers of identical constitution that differ
   only in the spatial arrangement of their groups. Optical isomers rotate the plane of
 O polarized light in different directions. The term "optical activity" means the degree to
   which an optical isomer rotates the plane of polarized light.
           The term "racemate" or "racemic mixture" means an equimolar mixture of two
   enantiomeric species, wherein each of the isolated species rotates the plane of
25 polarized light in the opposite direction such that the mixture is devoid of optical
   activity.
           The term "enantiomer" means an isomer having a nonsuperimposable mirror
   image. The term "diastereomer" means stereoisomers that are not enantiomers.
30
           The term "chiral" means a molecule that, in a given configuration, cannot be
   superimposed on its mirror image. This is in contrast to achiral molecules that can
   be superimposed on their mirror images.
                                                49

           The two distinct mirror image versions of the chiral molecule are also known
   as levo (left-handed), abbreviated L, or dextro (right-handed), abbreviated D,
   depending on which way they rotate polarized light. The symbols "R" and "S"
 5 represent the configuration of groups around a stereogenic carbon atom(s).
           The term "geometric isomer" means isomers that differ in the orientation of
   substituent atoms in relationship to a carbon-carbon double bond, to a cycloalkyl
   ring, or to a bridged bicyclic system. Substituent atoms (other than hydrogen) on
 0 each side of a carbon-carbon double bond may be in an E or Z configuration
   accordinging to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules. In the "E" configuration, the
   substituents having the highest priorities are on opposite sides in relationship to the
   carbon- carbon double bond. In the "Z" configuration, the substituents having the
   highest priorities are oriented on the same side in relationship to the carbon-carbon
 5 double bond.
           Substituent atoms (other than hydrogen) attached to a ring system may be in
   a cis or trans configuration. In the "cis" configuration, the substituents are on the
   same side in relationship to the plane of the ring; in the "trans" configuration, the
 O substituents are on opposite sides in relationship to the plane of the ring.
   Compounds having a mixture of "cis" and "trans" species are designated "cis/trans".
           The isomeric descriptors ("R," "S," "E," and "Z") indicate atom configurations
   and are intended to be used as defined in the literature.
25
           The compounds of the invention may be prepared as individual isomers by
   either isomer-specific synthesis or resolved from an isomeric mixture. Conventional
   resolution techniques include combining the free base (or free acid) of each isomer
   of an isomeric pair using an optically active acid (or base) to form an optically active
30 salt (followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base), forming
   an ester or amide of each of the isomers of an isomeric pair by reaction with an
   appropriate chiral auxiliary (followed by fractional crystallization or chromatographic
   separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary), or separating an isomeric mixture of
                                                 50

  either an intermediate or a final product using various well known chromatographic
  methods.
          Furthermore, compounds of the present invention may have one or more
5 polymorph or amorphous crystalline forms and, as such, are intended to be included
  in the scope of the invention. In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates
  with water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic solvents (e.g., organic esters such as
  ethanolate and the like) and, as such, are also intended to be encompassed within
  the scope of this invention.

   C) Synthesis
 5        The invention provides methods of making the disclosed compounds
   according to traditional organic synthetic methods as well as matrix or combinatorial
   synthetic methods. Schemes A, B and C describe suggested synthetic routes.
   Using the scheme, the guidelines below, and the examples, a person of skill in the
   art may develop analogous or similar methods for a given compound that is within
 0 the invention. These methods are representative of the synthetic schemes, but are
   not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.
          Where the compounds according to this invention have at least one chiral
   center, they may accordingly exist as enantiomers. Where the compounds possess
15 two or more chiral centers, they may additionally exist as diastereomers. Where the
   processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise
   to mixtures of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional
   techniques such as preparative chromatography. The compounds may be prepared
   in racemic form or as individual enantiomers or diasteromers by either stereospecific
20 synthesis or by resolution. The compounds may, for example, be resolved into their
   component enantiomers or diastereomers by standard techniques, such as the
                                              75

    formation of stereoisomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active base,
    followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free acid. The
    compounds may also be resolved by formation of stereoisomeric esters or amides,
    followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary.
 5  Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column. It is to
    be understood that all stereoisomers, racemic mixtures, diastereomers, geometric
    isomers, and enantiomers thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present
    invention.
 0          Representative compounds of the present invention can be synthesized in
    accordance with the general synthetic schemes described below and are illustrated
    more particularly in the specific synthetic examples that follow. The general
    schemes are offered by way of illustration; the invention should not be construed as
    being limited by the chemical reactions and conditions expressed. The methods for
 5  preparing the various starting materials used in the schemes and examples are well
    within the skill of persons versed in the art. No attempt has been made to optimize
    the yields obtained in any of the example reactions. One skilled in the art would
    know how to increase such yields through routine variations in reaction times,
    temperatures, solvents and/or reagents.
 10
            General: 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AC-300 (300
    MHz) spectrometer using tetramethylsilane and the deuterated solvent respectively
    as internal standards. Elemental analyses were obtained by Quantitative
    Technologies Inc. (Whitehouse, New Jersey) and the results were within 0.4% of the
25  calculated values unless otherwise mentioned. Melting points were determined in
    open capillary tubes with a Mel-Temp II apparatus (Laboratory Devices Inc.) and
    were uncorrected. Electrospray mass spectra (MS-ESI) were recorded in the
    positive mode on a Hewlett Packard 59987A spectrometer. High resolution mass
    spectra (HRMS) were obtained on a Micromass Autospec. E spectrometer by fast
30  atom bombardment (FAB) technique.
            Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may exist as
    polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention. In
                                                 76

  addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or
  common organic solvents, and such solvates are also intended to be encompassed
  within the scope of this invention.
5         Examples of the described synthetic routes include Schemes A, B and C,
  and Examples 1 through 72. Compounds analogous to the target compounds of
  these examples can be made according to similar routes. The disclosed compounds
  are useful as pharmaceutical agents as described herein.

   -78 0C, allowed to warm up to room temperature and stirred for 5h. The reaction was
   quenched by adding 6N HCI and extracted with EtOAc (x3). The organic fractions
   were combined and washed with sat. NaCI,, dried over Na2 SO 4 and evaporated

 5 between from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg; particularly from about 0.5 mg to about
   500 mg of the compound, and may be constituted into any form suitable for the
   mode of administration selected. The dosages, however, may be varied depending
   upon the requirement of the subjects, the severity of the condition being treated and
   the compound being employed. The use of either daily administration or post
 0 periodic dosing may be employed.
           When the compound of the invention is, for example, put into clinical use, its
   dose and its administration frequency may vary depending on the sex, the age, the
   body weight and the condition of the patient and on the type and the range of the
 5 necessary treatment with the compound. For oral administration, in general, the
   dose of the compound may be in a range of from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 100
   mg/kg of body weight/day or in a range of from about 0.03 mg/kg/day to about 1
   mg/kg/day. The oral administration frequency is preferably from one to a few times
   per day. For parenteral administration, the dose may be in a range of from about
 O 0.001 mg/kg/day to about 10 mg/kg/day, in a range of from about 0.001 mg/kg/day to
   about 0.1 mg/kg/day or, in a range of from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 0.1
   mg/kg/day. The parenteral administration frequency is preferably from one to a few
   times per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in
   the form of tablets containing from about 1.0 mg to about 1000 mg of the active
25 ingredient, particularly 1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100
   mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, 600 mg, 750 mg, 800 mg,
   900 mg, and 1000 mg of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the
   dosage to the patient to be treated. The compounds may be administered on a
   regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day.
30
           When treating an N-type calcium channel-mediated disorder, a therapeutic
   effect is expected upon administering the compounds of the present invention at a
   daily dosage of from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight. The dosing
                                              159

   regimen may range from a single daily dose or a divided dose two to six times a day,
   or in sustained release form. For a large mammal, the total daily dosage may be in a
   range of from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, or a range of from about 1 mg to about
   50 mg. In the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from
 5 about 7 mg to about 350 mg. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the
   optimal therapeutic response.
           Ordinary physicians, veterinarians and clinicians may readily determine the
   effective dose of the pharmaceutical compound necessary to treat, prevent, inhibit,
 0 retard or stop the intended disease, and may readily treat the diseased patient with
   the compound.
           The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per unit dosage unit,
   e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, suppository, teaspoonful and the like, of from
 5 about 0.001 mg/kg/day to about 10 mg/kg/day (particularly from about 0.01
   mg/kg/day to about 1 mg/kg/day; and, more particularly, from about 0.1 mg/kg/day to
   about 0.5 mg/kg/day) and may be given at a dosage of from about 0.001 mg/kg/day
   to about 30 mg/kg/day (particularly from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 2 mg/kg/day,
   more particularly from about 0.1 mg/kg/day to about 1 mg/kg/day and even more
 O particularly from about 0.5 mg/kg/day to about 1 mg/kg/day).
           Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms from such as tablets,
   pills, capsules, dry powders for reconstitution or inhalation, granules, lozenges,
   sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops,
25 ampoules, autoinjector devices or suppositories for administration by oral, intranasal,
   sublingual, intraocular, transdermal, parenteral, rectal, vaginal, dry powder inhaler or
   other inhalation or insufflation means. Alternatively, the composition may be
   presented in a form suitable for 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per
   day administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as
30 the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular
   injection.
           The preparation may contain the compound of the invention in an amount in a
                                               160

    range of from about 1.0 to about 100 % by weight or, in a range of from about 1.0 to
    about 60 % by weight of the preparation. The preparation may contain any other
    therapeutically-effective compound.
 5          The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the compounds of
    this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the
    compounds which are readily convertible in vivo into the required compound. Thus,
    in the methods of treatment of the present invention, the term "administering" shall
    encompass the treatment of the various disorders described with the compound
 0  specifically disclosed or with a compound which may not be specifically disclosed,
    but which converts to the specified compound in vivo after administration to the
    subject. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable
    prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H.
    Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.
 5
            Some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may exist as polymorphs
    and as such are intended to be included in the present invention. In addition, some
    of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic
    solvents, and such solvates are intended to be encompassed within the scope of this
 '0 invention.
            Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the
    invention give rise to mixtures of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by
    conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. The compounds may
25  be prepared in racemic form or as individual enantiomers or diasteromers by either
    stereospecific synthesis or by resolution. The compounds may, for example, be
    resolved into their component enantiomers or diastereomers by standard techniques,
    such as the formation of stereoisomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically
    active base, followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free acid.
30  The compounds may also be resolved by formation of stereoisomeric esters or
    amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary.
    Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column. It is to
    be understood that all stereoisomers, racemic mixtures, diastereomers, cis-trans
                                                161

    isomers, and enantiomers thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present
    invention.

 5          1.     Dosages
            For preparing pharmaceutical compositions such as tablets, the principal
    active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting
    ingredients such as diluents, binders, adhesives, disintegrants, lubricants,
    antiadherents and gildants. Suitable diluents include, but are not limited to, starch
 0  (i.e. corn, wheat, or potato starch, which may be hydrolized), lactose (granulated,
    spray dried or anhydrous), sucrose, sucrose-based diluents (confectioner's sugar;
    sucrose plus about 7 to 10 weight percent invert sugar; sucrose plus about 3 weight
    percent modified dextrins; sucrose plus invert sugar, about 4 weight percent invert
    sugar, about 0.1 to 0.2 weight percent cornstarch and magnesium stearate),
 5  dextrose, inositol, mannitol, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose (i.e. AVICEL TM
    microcrystalline cellulose available from FMC Corp.), dicalcium phosphate, calcium
    sulfate dihydrate, calcium lactate trihydrate and the like. Suitable binders and
    adhesives include, but are not limited to acacia gum, guar gum, tragacanth gum,
    sucrose, gelatin, glucose, starch, and cellulosics (i.e. methylcellulose, sodium
 '0 carboxymethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,
    hydroxypropylcellulose, and the like), water soluble or dispersible binders (i.e. alginic
    acid and salts thereof, magnesium aluminum silicate, hydroxyethylcellulose [i.e.
    TYLOSE TMavailable from Hoechst Celanese], polyethylene glycol, polysaccharide
    acids, bentonites, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polymethacrylates and pregelatinized starch)
25  and the like. Suitable disintegrants include, but are not limited to, starches (corn,
    potato, etc.), sodium starch glycolates, pregelatinized starches, clays (magnesium
    aluminum silicate), celluloses (such as crosslinked sodium carboxymethylcellulose
    and microcrystalline cellulose), alginates, pregelatinized starches (i.e. corn starch,
    etc.), gums (i.e. agar, guar, locust bean, karaya, pectin, and tragacanth gum), cross
30  linked polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like. Suitable lubricants and antiadherents
    include, but are not limited to, stearates (magnesium, calcium and sodium), stearic
    acid, talc waxes, stearowet, boric acid, sodium chloride, DL-leucine, carbowax 4000,
    carbowax 6000, sodium oleate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium lauryl
                                                162

   limited to, talc, cornstarch, silica (i.e. CAB-O-SIL TMSilica available from Cabot,
   SYLOID     TM silica available from W.R. Grace/Davison, and AEROSIL        TM silica available
   from Degussa) and the like. Sweeteners and flavorants may be added to chewable
 5 solid dosage forms to improve the palatability of the oral dosage form. Additionally,
   colorants and coatings may be added or applied to the solid dosage form for ease of
   identification of the drug or for aesthetic purposes. These carriers are formulated
   with the pharmaceutical active to provide an accurate, appropriate dose of the
   pharmaceutical active with a therapeutic release profile.
 0
            Generally these carriers are mixed with the pharmaceutical active to form a
   solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of the
   pharmaceutical active form of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically
   acceptable salt thereof. Generally the preformulation will be formed by one of three
 5 common methods: (a) wet granulation, (b) dry granulation and (c) dry blending.
   When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant
   that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the
   composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms such as
   tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided
 O into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from about 0.1 mg to
   about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills
   containing the novel compositions may also be formulated in multilayer tablets or
   pills to provide a sustained or provide dual-release products. For example, a dual
   release tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component,
25 the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can
   be separated by an enteric layer, which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach
   and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed
   in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings,
   such materials including a number of polymeric materials such as shellac, cellulose
30 acetate (i.e. cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimetllitate), polyvinyl
   acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, hydroxypropyl
   methylcellulose acetate succinate, methacrylate and ethylacrylate copolymers,
   methacrylate and methyl methacrylate copolymers and the like. Sustained release
                                                 163

    tablets may also be made by film coating or wet granulation using slightly soluble or
    insoluble substances in solution (which for a wet granulation acts as the binding
    agents) or low melting solids a molten form (which in a wet granulation may
    incorporate the active ingredient). These materials include natural and synthetic
 5  polymers waxes, hydrogenated oils, fatty acids and alcohols (i.e. beeswax, carnauba
    wax, cetyl alcohol, cetylstearyl alcohol, and the like), esters of fatty acids metallic
    soaps, and other acceptable materials that can be used to granulate, coat, entrap or
    otherwise limit the solubility of an active ingredient to achieve a prolonged or
    sustained release product.

    limited to parabens (i.e. methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and n-butyl), sorbic acid, thimerosal,
    quaternary ammonium salts, benzyl alcohol, benzoic acid, chlorhexidine gluconate,
    phenylethanol and the like. There are many liquid vehicles that may be used in
    liquid pharmaceutical dosage forms; however, the liquid vehicle that is used in a
 5  particular dosage form must be compatible with the suspending agent(s). For
    example, nonpolar liquid vehicles such as fatty esters and oils liquid vehicles are
    best used with suspending agents such as low HLB (Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance)
    surfactants, stearalkonium hectorite, water insoluble resins, water insoluble film
    forming polymers and the like. Conversely, polar liquids such as water, alcohols,
 0  polyols and glycols are best used with suspending agents such as higher HLB
    surfactants, clays silicates, gums, water soluble cellulosics, water soluble polymers
    and the like. For parenteral administration, sterile suspensions and solutions are
    desired. Liquid forms useful for parenteral administration include sterile solutions,
    emulsions and suspensions. Isotonic preparations which generally contain suitable
 5  preservatives are employed when intravenous administration is desired.
            Furthermore, compounds of the present invention can be administered in an
    intranasal dosage form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles or via
    transdermal skin patches, the composition of which are well known to those of
 '0 ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery
    system, the administration of a therapeutic dose will, of course, be continuous rather
    than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.
            Compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of
25  liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar
    vesicles, multilamellar vesicles and the like. Liposomes can be formed from a
    variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, phosphatidylcholines and
    the like.
30          The daily dose of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may
    be varied over a wide range from about 0.1 mg to about 5000 mg; preferably, the
    dose will be in the range of from about 1 mg to about 100 mg per day for an average
    human. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form
                                                165

    of tablets containing, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100,
    150, 200, 250 or 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic
    adjustment of the dosage to the subject to be treated.        Advantageously, a
    compound of the present invention may be administered in a single daily dose or the
 5  total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times
    daily.
            It is also apparent to one skilled in the art that the therapeutically effective
    dose for active compounds of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition thereof
 0  will vary according to the desired effect. Therefore, optimal dosages to be
    administered may be readily determined by those skilled in the art, and will vary with
    the particular compound used, the mode of administration, the strength of the
    preparation, and the advancement of the disease condition. In addition, factors
    associated with the particular subject being treated, including subject age, weight,
 5  diet and time of administration, will result in the need to adjust the dose to an
    appropriate therapeutic level. The above dosages are thus exemplary of the
    average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower
    dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.
 10         Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing
    compositions and dosage regimens or by means of those compositions and dosage
    regimens established in the art whenever use of the compounds of the invention as
    N-type calcium channel inhibitors is required for a subject in need thereof.
25          In their use, the compounds of the invention may be combined with any other
    therapeutic agents that are useful for the treatment of an N-type calcium channel
    mediated disorder.
            The combination includes not only the composition of compounds of the
30  invention and one other active substance but also the composition of compounds of
    the invention and two or more other active substances. The scope of possible
    combinations of a compound of the invention and one, two or more active
    substances are within the knowledge of one skilled in the art for the treatment of an
                                                  166

    N-type calcium channel-mediated disorder.
            The compounds of the present invention may also be combined with a non
    drug therapy such as kinesitherapy, dietetic treatment or radiation therapy. The
 5  compound and the combined compositions of the invention are effective for treating
    and preventing pain.
            2.     Formulations
            To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, one or more
 0  compounds of Formula (I) or salt thereof as the active ingredient, is intimately
    admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical
    compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending
    of the form of preparation desired for administration (e.g. oral or parenteral).
    Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well known in the art. Descriptions
 5  of some of these pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be found in The
    Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, published by the American Pharmaceutical
    Association and the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.
            The compounds of the present invention may be formulated into various
 '0 pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. Methods of formulating
    pharmaceutical compositions have been described in numerous publications such as
    Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, Second Edition, Revised and Expanded,
    Volumes 1-3, edited by Lieberman et al; Pharmaceutical Dosaqe Forms: Parenteral
    Medications, Volumes 1-2, edited by Avis et al; and Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms:
25  Disperse Systems, Volumes 1-2, edited by Lieberman et al; published by Marcel
    Dekker, Inc.
    F) Biological Examples
            The ability of the compounds of the present invention to treat an N-type
30  calcium channel mediated condition was determined using the following procedures.
                                               167

                                            Example 1
   Expression and Purification of Cav2.2 Stable Cell Line
           The Cav2.2   (U1B) subunit (GenBank accession no. AA053230; supplied by
 5 Lipscombe's laboratory at Brown University) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1, whereas
   the a26 (M86621) and P3 (M88751) subunits were subcloned into pBudCE4.1
   vectors. Stable cell lines expressing all three subunits were generated according to
   the following procedure: 1) HEK293 cells were transfected with         C2-1/p3 expression
   constructs resulting in a stable cell line expressing    C26-1 and P3 subunits that were
 0 selected under 200 pg/mL of Zeocin; 2) a stable cell line expressing a26-1/p3
   subunits in high quantity as evidenced in its Western blots was isolated from the
   colony and purified; 3) this cell line was further transfected with Cav2.2 expression
   constructs, from which cells were subsequently selected under 400 tg/mL G418 and
   200 ptg/mL Zeocin; 4) these cells were clonally isolated, expanded and screened by
 5 Western blot analysis for expressing all three subunits
           Western blot analysis included washing the cells with phosphate-buffered
   saline, collecting and resuspending in lysis buffer, applying gel electrophoresis with a
   4%-20% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide medium at 30 mA for 90 min. After
 O transferring proteins in the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane, the blot was incubated
   with primary antibodies in reconstituted 2% fat dry milk, 0.5% Tween 20, 100 mM
   NaCI, and 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH = 7.4) at 4 0C overnight. Primary antibodies were
   obtained from Sigma and included      anti-a1B  (1:200), anti-a26-1 (1:500), and anti-p3
   (1:1,000). Furthermore, blots were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with
25 secondary goat anti-rabbit (1:20,000) or goat anti-mouse (1:2,000) serum that was
   obtained from Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific. Finally, X-ray film of the ECL Plus Kit
   from Amersham/GE Healthcare Life Sciences was used to visualize the blots.
           Cultures of cells stably expressing Cav2.2 were maintained at 37 0C in low
30 glucose-containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium (low glucose) under a 5%
   CO 2 atmosphere. The medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
   2mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 400 ptg/mL G418
                                                168

   and 200 ptg/mL Zeocin.
                                            Example 2
   Automated Electrophysiology Assay
 5         High-throughput automated patch clamp system experiments were carried out
   using instruments (QPatch-HT) available from Sophion Biosciences, Inc. North
   Brunswick, NJ. Cells were grown in T175 flasks to 50%-90% confluence were
   enzymatically treated with Deatchin (Genlantis, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.), centrifuged,
   rinsed and resuspended in 293 SFM II media (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY,
 0 U.S.A.) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) to
   a concentration of 2-3 x 106 cells/mL. Cells were added to automated cell
   preparation station on the QPatch-HT (Sophion Biosciences, North Brunswick, NJ,
   U.S.A.) and following a 10-to 30-min recovery period with gentle stirring, the assay
   protocol was initiated. During the automated cell preparation, cells were collected,
 5 centrifuged and resuspended in an extracellular (EC) solution containing 132 mM
   NaCI, 1.8 mM CaCl 2 , 5.4 mM KCI, 0.8 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM
   HEPES (pH = 7.4), adjusted with sucrose to 315 mOsm. The QPlate was primed with
   an intracellular solution containing 135 CsCI, 10 mM EGTA, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP,
   and 20 mM HEPES (pH = 7.2), adjusted to approximately 290 mOsm with deionized
 O water and the EC solution. Cells were added to the preparded QPlate wells by
   robotic pipettes of the QPatch-HT.
           For cells determined to be in stable whole-cell patch clamp, the EC solution
   was replaced with a barium (Ba)/triethylammonium (TEA) solution containing 140
25 mM TEA-Cl, 10 mM BaCI 2 , 0.8 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES (pH
   = 7.4). High (40 mM) BaCI 2 concentrations were made with adjustments of TEA-Cl
   (90 mM) to maintain the osmolarity. From a resting potential of -80mV, a train of
   depolarizing pulses (15 pulses at 5 Hz, +20 mV) was delivered to the cell once every
   30 sec for eitht trains (4 min total), and the resulting currents were measured during
30 a control period (no compound). This protocol was repeated for each subsequent
   addition of control buffer with or without compound (three periods total, each with
   four trains). The current generated in the 1st and     1 5 th pulses of the last train of each
   period in the presence of each drug concentration was normalized to the current
                                                169

    generated during the control period at the respective pulses (representing low- and
    high frequency stimulation, respectively). Data from both the second and third drug
    application period were analyzed for each cell. A final addition of Ba/TEA solution
    containing 60-100 uM CdCl 2 was made to block all N-type current and "zero" the
 5  currents for each cell. A buffer/compound additions were made using a "spitting"
    feature of the QPatch-HT, which added three repretitions of 5 tL solution at the
    beginning of each recording period.
            To examine closed-state inactivation, cells were subjected to a channel
 0  activating 50-msec depolarizing step pulse from -80 to +10 mV, followed by a 5-sec
    nonactivating step to voltages ranging from -130 to -60 mV in 10 mV increments and
    then a 50-ms step from -80 to +10 mV to assess the remaining current. Currents
    from the activating voltage pulse were normalized to the peak value of the test pulse
    following the -130 mV step and fit to a Boltzman equation to obtain the V1/2.
 5  Roscovitine (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared as a 100 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide
    and diluted to the indicated working concentrations. Tetrandrine (Sigma-Aldrich)
    was prepared as a 4 mM stock in acidic water (pH = 2.0) and then diluted to working
    concentrations in the external solution. L-Conotoxin MVIIA (Sigma-Aldrich) was
    prepared as a 0.3 mg/mL stock solution in water, with 0.1% bovine serum albumin V
 '0 (Life Technologies). Compounds of Formula (I) were diluted first into dimethyl
    sulfoxide and then into 10% pluronic F-127 in water (Life Technologies), sonicated
    for 1 min and diluted into EC buffer. Vehicle controls were run in parallel in all
    experiments.
25          Unless otherwise indicated, statistics for comparing among
    electrophysiological results utilized a one-way analysis of variance with Fisher's least
    squares determination test for pair-wise comparison. Resultant data are shown in
    Table 2.

   Calcium-Dye Indicator Assay
          A stable cell line (HEK parent) co-expressing the  X1B (Cav2.2), P3 and C2
 5 subunits of the N-type calcium channel subunits was used. These cells were
   routinely grown as monolayers in low glucose-containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle
   Medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 1.U./mL penicillin, 100
   pg/mL streptomycin, 400 pg/mL G418 and 200 pg/mL Zeocin (split ratio = 1:5). Cells
   were maintained in 5% CO 2 at 37 0 C. Compounds of Formula (I) were prepared as
10 10 mM stocks in DMSO from neat compound, if available. Otherwise, the 5 or 10
   mM DMSO stock solutions provided in-house were used.
          Calcium mobilization responses to KCI depolarization were evaluated by
   measuring the intensity of calcium-mediated fluorescent signal in the presence of BD
15 Calcium Assay Dye (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, U.S.A.), utilizing a
   Functional Drug Screening System (FDSS) by Hamamatsu Corporation
   (Bridgewater, NJ, U.S.A.).
                                             172

           Twenty-four hours prior to assay, cells were seeded in clear-base poly-D
    lysine coated 384-well plates (BD Biosciences) at a density of 5,000 cells per well in
    culture medium and grown overnight in 5% CO 2 at 37 0C. On the day of assay
 5  growth media were removed and cells were loaded with BD calcium assay dye (BD
    Biosciences) for 35 min at 37 0 C under 5% CO 2 and then for 25 min at room
    temperature. Utilizing the FDSS, cells were exposed to representative compounds of
    Formula (I) at varying concentrations and intracellular calcium was measured for 5
    min prior to the addition of 50 mM KCI for an additional 3 min of measurement.

    Calculations and Formulas
            IC50 values for representative compounds of Formula (I) were determined
    from six-point concentration-response experiments and represent the concentration
    of said compound required to inhibit 50% of the maximal response. Maximal
 5  fluorescence intensity (FI) achieved upon addition of 50 mM KCI was exported from
    the FDSS software and further analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 (Graph Pad
    Software Inc., CA, U.S.A.). Data were normalized to the maximum average counts
    from quadruplicate wells for each condition in the presence of 50 mM KCI and to the
    minimum average counts in the presence of buffer. Theoretical curves were
 '0 generated using nonlinear regression curve-fitting analysis of either sigmoidal
    concentration-response or sigmoidal concentration-response (variable slope), and
    the IC50 values with the best-fit dose curve determined by GraphPad Prism were
    reported. Resultant data are shown in Table 3.

                                            Example 4
    Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced hyperalgesia
            The intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in rodents
    results in a long-lasting inflammatory reaction, characterized by a pronounced
 5  hypersensitivity to both thermal and mechanical stimuli, which peaks between 24-72
    hr following injection and can last for several weeks. This test predicts the analgesic,
    anti-allodynic and/or anti-hyperalgesic effect of numerous efficacious clinical agents,
    including acetaminophen, NSAIDS, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, opioids, such as
    morphine, and especially the N-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide, which is
 0  marketed as Prialt@ for the management of severe chronic pain, including several
    types of neuropathic pain.
            To assess whether test compounds of Formula (I) reverse established
    hypersensitivity, a 100 ptL of CFA (suspended in a 1:1 emulsion of saline and heat
 5  killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in mineral oil) was injected into a single hind paw
    of Sprague-Dawley rats (typically males ranging from 150-350 g).
    Each rat was placed in a test chamber on a warm glass surface and allowed to
    acclimate for approximately 10 min. A radiant thermal stimulus (beam of light) was
    then focused through the glass onto the plantar surface of each hind paw in turn.
 '0 The thermal stimulus was automatically shut off by a photoelectric relay when the
    paw was moved or when the cut-off time was reached (20 sec for radiant heat at -5
    Amps). An initial (baseline) response latency to the thermal stimulus was recorded
    for each animal prior to the injection of CFA. Twenty-four hr following intraplantar
    CFA injection, the response latency of the animal to the thermal stimulus was then
25  re-evaluated and compared to the animal's baseline response time. Only rats that
    exhibited at least a 25% reduction in response latency (i.e., hyperalgesia) were
    included in further analysis. Immediately following the post-CFA latency
    assessment, test compound or vehicle (usually Solutol, hydroxypropyl
    methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin or PEG-400) was administered i.p.
30  or p.o. to rats. Post-compound treatment withdrawal latencies were assessed at
    fixed time intervals, typically 30, 60 and 120 min. Resultant data for vehicle and
    compounds 1 and 14 of Formula (I) are shown in Figure 1.
