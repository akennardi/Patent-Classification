                                  GROUND ENGAGING TOOLS
           This invention relates to ground engaging tools for earthmoving and mining
   equipment. The invention has particular application to ground engaging tools for the cutting
   edge of excavator buckets and the invention will be described with particular reference to
 5 such application. However, the invention may have application to ground engaging tools for
   other types of equipment, for example, shovel buckets, bucket loaders, dragline buckets,
   bulldozer blades, drotts, bobcats, and backhoes.
           Typically, excavator buckets and the like have a base or floor with a cutting edge or
   lip to which ground engaging tools are fitted to engage the ground or spoil which is to be
10 excavated or loaded as the case may be and to protect the lip from wear. Commonly, the
   ground engaging tools have a number of components. The first component, often called the
   nose, nose base, nosepiece or nose mount, is usually fixed in a permanent or semi-permanent
   manner to the base of the bucket by welding and protrudes forward from the lip. The second
   component is releasably mounted on or to the nose so that it can be replaced when it reaches
15 a predetermined wear condition. In some types of equipment the second component is the
   cutting tip, tooth or tooth point which engages the ground at its front edge and suffers the
   main wear, while in other equipment, the second component is an adaptor to which a third
   component being the cutting tip or tooth is releasably fitted which in turn suffers the main
   wear while the adaptor suffers lesser wear. Thus, it will be understood that while the tooth in
20 a three component system will have a much shorter life than the adaptor the adaptors
   themselves do eventually wear out and have to be replaced. Even the nose may wear out long
   before the bucket floor and walls and have to be replaced but in the case of the nose, it can be
   cut away from the base and replaced by new noses which can be welded to the base but that
   requires substantial downtime for a fairly substantial operation. In the case of a two
25 component system, while the releasable tooth can be replaced relatively easily, if the nose
   wears out, a fairly substantial operation is required to replace it as with a three component
   system.
           Typically, the nose includes a forwardly extending protuberance which is adapted to
   engage in a complementary cavity provided in the tooth or the adaptor in a three component
30 system. In some prior art systems, the protuberance includes a tapered portion which is often
   referred to as the "cone". In this specification, the term "cone' is also used to refer to the
   tapered portion even though it may not be conical in shape.
           In a two component system, the adaptor has a cavity opening at one end in which the
   complementary protuberance on the nose engages and a protuberance at the other end which

                                                    2
   is adapted to engage in the complementary tooth cavity. The two components are commonly
   releasably secured together by one or more locking pins which lock the tooth and the
   underlying adaptor together or the adaptor and the underlying nose in the case of a three
   component system. There are various securing systems available which are commonly
 5 referred to as retaining systems.
           In one known retainer system, a tapered pin is driven through aligned holes extending
   through the tooth and the adaptor from top to bottom or the adaptor and the nose. However,
   the hole causes a weakness in the nose or the adaptor in a three component system which
   leads to failure. In another case, two opposed relatively short locking pins located in the nose
10 are arranged to be extended into complementary holes or openings in the opposed side walls
   of the tooth or adaptor mounted on the nose.
           It will be appreciated that the cavities and protuberances are shaped to inhibit relative
   movement between the engaging components when in operation, although the presently
   known systems do not inhibit relative movement as well as desired. Further, the presently
15 available retaining systems do not provide the reliability or efficiency of operation desired.
           In this specification, unless the context clearly requires a different meaning, the term
   forward and its derivatives are to be understood as being in the direction of movement of the
   tooth or bucket when digging or filling the bucket with spoil. Tenrs such as upper, lower,
   side, front, rear, and the like are to be understood in the context of the tooth digging so that
20 the leading edge of the tooth is the front of the tooth.
           With the foregoing in view, the invention resides broadly in a nose mount and
   complementary tooth in combination for earthmoving and mining equipment, the nose mount
   having a base for securing the nose mount to the lip of a bucket and a protuberance extending
   forwardly therefrom,

           In yet another aspect, the invention resides broadly in a nose mount for earthmoving

10         a base for mounting the nose mount to the lip of a bucket; and
           a protuberance extending forwardly from the base, the protuberance including a cone
   portion defined at least in part by spaced apart upper and lower faces and opposed spaced
   apart side faces, the upper and lower faces being joined to the side faces by curved corner

   of the cone portion respectively, and the upper and lower faces of the beak portion being
   generally parallel and the side faces of the beak portion also being generally parallel and
   contiguous with a front face of the beak portion.
           Preferably, the protuberance and the cavity are symmetrical about a vertical plane
25 extending from the upper face to the lower face (the vertical symmetrical plane). It is also
   preferred that the protuberance and the cavity be symmetrical about a horizontal plane
   extending from the front face of the beak portion to the mounting portion in the case of an
   adaptor or the base in the case of a nose mount in the central part (the horizontal symmetrical
   plane). It that respect, it will be appreciated that the curved corner faces joining the upper
30 face to the side faces and the lower face to the side faces may have different radii.
           Preferably, the front face of the beak portion of the protuberance and the cavity is
   generally planar.
           Preferably, the upper and lower faces of the cone portion of the nose and the cavity
   each include a substantially planar centre portion which is contiguous with the curved corner

                                                   8
   portions on opposite sides thereof. However, in a particularly preferred form, the
   protuberance includes a keying ridge forming opposed keying shoulders with the lower face
   of the cone portion and depending therefrom.
           Preferably, the adaptor and the tooth have an opening in each side of the mounting
 5 portion thereof for mounting a lock therein for use in releasably securing the mounting
   portion to an adaptor or a nose mount in the case of a tooth or a nose mount in the case of an
   adaptor. In a preferred form, the openings are centred on a transverse axis passing through a
   horizontal plane about which the adaptor and tooth are each substantially symmetrical as
   previously mentioned.
10         Preferably, the cone portion of the protuberance of the nose mount and the adaptor
   has an opening in each side thereof for receiving therein a retaining lug, pin or the like from a
   lock mounted in the mounting portion of an adaptor or tooth for securing an adaptor to a nose
   mount or a tooth to an adaptor as the case may be. In a particularly preferred form such
   openings are blind holes centred on a transverse axis passing through the horizontal
15 symmetrical plane and substantially coaxial with the corresponding axis passing through
   aligned complementary holes formed in the tooth or adaptor as the case may be as previously
   described.
           Preferably, the base of the nose mount and the mounting portion of the adaptor
   include spaced apart recesses (ear pockets) adapted to provide respective load bearing faces
20 adjacent the side faces for transferring pushing loads from the nose mount or the adaptor as
   the case may be to the tooth or the adaptor when the adaptor is fitted to a nose mount. In a
   preferred form in which complementary holes are formed in the sides of the nose mount, such
   bearing faces are orthogonal to the vertical symmetrical plane and part cylindrical in form
   and centred on the transverse centre axis of such complementary holes. Advantageously,
25 such ear pockets allow the tooth and the adaptor to have complementary projections or ears to
   be provided about the holes in the sides thereof to provide sufficient strength in that area and
   such complementary projections are arranged to engage the respective load bearing faces.
   Advantageously, it is preferred that the projections be arranged to engage the side faces of the
   cone portion to assist in inhibiting relative movement between the adaptor or the tooth and
30 the nose mount or between the tooth and the adaptor.
           In yet another aspect the invention resides broadly in a nose mount having a base for
   securing the nose mount to the lip of a bucket and a protuberance extending forwardly
   therefrom,

           Fig. 22 is a pictorial sectional plan along a symmetrical horizontal plane of the nose
   mount with adaptor mounted thereon and tooth mounted to the adaptor as shown in Fig 21.
            The bucket 10 illustrated in Fig. 1 has a floor 11 with a ground engaging leading edge
   (or lip) 12 at its front. The floor curves upwardly behind the lip to form a contiguous rear
 5 wall 13 which in turn curves upwards and forwards to form a contiguous upper wall 14, the
   floor, the rear wall and the upper wall forming a generally u-shaped bucket enclosed by
   opposed generally planar side walls 16 and 18 with an open front 15. A curved lifting arch or
   bar 21 extends across the top of the bucket between the side walls and a plurality of spaced
   apart lifting lugs 19 are welded to the arch and the upper wall for connection of an excavator
10 lifting arm and crowd arm thereto in known manner.
           A plurality of spaced apart nose mounts 30 are welded to the bucket floor 11 across
   the front and extend forward from the lip 12. The nose mounts described in this embodiment
   are solid cast iron or steel fittings. Teeth 25 are fitted to the nose mounts as will be described
   in more detail later.
15         As can be seen in Figs. 4 to 10, the nose mount 30 is shown cut away at its rear (the
   lip end) along lines A and B, the portion of the nose mount beyond lines A and B by which it
   is mounted to the lip of the bucket not being relevant to the present invention. It will be
   appreciated that the portion by which it is mounted to the floor of the bucket may have
   different shapes and arrangements depending on the bucket floor to which the nose mount is
20 to be mounted. In that regard, the present invention relates to the shape of the portion of the
   mount which is referred to herein as base 31 and the protuberance 32 which extends
   therefrom.
            The protuberance 32 includes a cone portion 33 extending forward from the base 31
   and terminating in a beak portion 34. The cone portion is defined by upper and lower faces
25 36 and 37 which converge forwardly away from the base 31 and two opposed side faces 40
   and 41 which also converge away from the base, the upper and lower faces being joined to
   the side faces by curved corner faces 42, 43, 44 and 45 which are contiguous with the upper
   and lower faces and the opposed side faces. It will be appreciated that the converging upper
   and lower faces and the converging side faces result in the corner faces diminishing away
30 from the base towards the beak portion to a line at the beak portion.
            The upper and lower faces of the cone portion converge into the opposed parallel
   upper and lower faces 51 and 52 respectively of the beak portion and the opposed side faces
   40 and 41 of the cone portion converge into the opposed parallel side faces 53 and 54 of the
   beak portion at vertical plane 55.      Advantageously, the upper and lower faces and the two

                                                  13
   opposed side faces of the beak portion terminate in a front face 56 which is generally planar
   and orthogonal to the opposed parallel side faces and the opposed parallel upper and lower
   faces of the beak portion.
           It will be appreciated that the protuberance is substantially symmetrical about a
 5 substantially "horizontal" plane passing through the centreline of the front face 56 along line
   9 - 9 and the horizontal centreline of the base 31. The term "horizontal" is used in describing
   the general appearance of the nose mount even though that plane might not be actually
   horizontal in use. It will also be appreciated that the nose mount is symmetrical about a
   vertical plane passing through the vertical centreline of the front face and the vertical
10 centreline of the base along line 11 - II as can be seen in Fig. 8.
           As can be seen in the drawings, opposed blind holes 61 and 62 having end faces 61a
   and 62a respectively are formed in the sides of the cone portion of the protuberance 32 for
   receiving therein retaining pins when a tooth or adaptor is mounted thereon.
           It will also be seen that a keying ridge 64 depends from the lower face 37 and is
15 centred on the vertical symmetrical plane 11 - 11 for the purpose of keying in a
   complementary slot provided in the tooth or adaptor as the case may be. Advantageously, the
   keying ridge has opposed parallel side faces 66 and 67 which provide shoulders against
   which complementary shoulders formed by the complementary slot in the tooth or adaptor
   can engage to inhibit sideways and rotational movement of the tooth or adaptor relative to the
20 nose mount.
           Opposed recesses 71 and 72 (sometimes referred to as ear pockets) are formed in the
   base 31 adjacent the side faces 40 and 41 respectively, the ear pocket recesses providing
   generally part cylindrical faces 73 and 74 respectively against which corresponding
   protuberances on the tooth may engage for transferring pushing loads from the nose mount or
25 the adaptor as the case may be to the tooth (or the adaptor if fitted to the nose mount).
   Advantageously, the cylindrical faces act in conjunction with the front face 56 and the faces
   on the cone portion to provide a relatively large engagement surface for transmitting pushing
   loads and also to assist with the prevention of yawing. In that regard, the side faces of the ear
   pockets 71a and 71b respectively bear side loads applied by the tooth or adaptor fitted on the
30 nose (of the adaptor or the nose mount as the case may be).
           The adaptor 80 shown in Figs. 15 to 20 includes a mounting portion (or body) 81 from
   which a protuberance 82 extends forward for mounting a tooth thereon as will be described
   more fully later. The adaptor has a cavity 83 formed in the mounting portion and opening to

                                                  14
   the rear at entry opening 84 for receiving therein the protuberance 32 of the tooth or adaptor
   mount 30 as previously described.
           Suitably, the cavity has a shape complementary to the shape of protuberance 32 of the
   nose mount with a cone portion 85 extending forward from the opening 84 and terminating in
 5 a beak portion 86. It will be appreciated that the cavity is defined at least in part by the inner
   faces of a wall 79 extending about the top. bottom and side of the cavity. In that respect, the
   cone portion is defined by opposed upper and lower faces 87 and 88 which converge
   forwardly away from the opening 84, and two opposed side faces 89 and 90 which also
   converge away from the opening 84, the upper and lower faces being joined to the side faces
10 by curved corner faces 91, 92, 93 and 94 which are contiguous with the upper and lower
   faces and the opposed side faces as can be seen more clearly in Fig. 19.
           It will be appreciated that the converging upper and lower faces and the converging
   side faces result in the corner faces diminishing away from the opening 84 towards the beak
   portion in the same manner as the nose mount previously described. The beak portion of the
15 cavity is defined by opposed upper and lower faces 100 and 101 and opposed side faces 102
   and 103, the upper and lower faces being parallel to each other and the side faces also being
   parallel to each other and all four faces being contiguous with a front face 108 which is
   generally planar and orthogonal to the opposed parallel side faces and the opposed parallel
   upper and lower faces.
20         Suitably, the upper and lower faces and the side faces are joined by radius corner
   faces 104, 105, 106 and 107 and the upper and lower faces of the cone portion converge into
   the opposed parallel upper and lower faces 100 and 101 respectively of the beak portion.
   Similarly, the opposed side faces 89 and 90 of the cone portion of the cavity converge into
   the parallel side faces 102 and 103. As with the protuberance of the nose mount, the cavity is
25 substantially symmetrical about a horizontal plane passing through the opening 84 and also
   about a vertical plane passing through the vertical centre line of the front face of the cavity
   108.
           Advantageously, opposed protuberances (ear lugs) 111 and 112 extend from the
   mounting portion rearwardly beyond the opening 84, the ear lugs providing generally part
30 cylindrical faces 113 and 114 adapted to engage with the part cylindrical faces 73 and 74 of
   the ear pockets of the nose mount as previously described. It will be appreciated that the part
   cylindrical faces of the ear pockets engaging with the part cylindrical faces 113 and 114 of
   the ear lugs provides a suitable mechanism for transferring pushing loads from the nose
   mount to the adaptor and hence to the tooth.

                                                   15
           A keying recess 121 is formed in the bottom wall of the mounting portion of the
   adaptor (or tooth as the case may be) for receiving therein the keying ridge 64 of the nose
   mount.
           It will also be seen in Fig. 15 that opposed through holes 131 and 132 are provided in
 5 the wall 79 of the mounting portion of the adaptor for receiving therein retaining pins for
   securing the adaptor to the nose mount. It will be appreciated that there are various retainer
   systems available which would be suitable for use with the present invention.
           The tooth 25 is the same as the adaptor 80 in many respects, the main difference, apart
   from size, being that instead of having a protuberance 82 extending forward from the
10 mounting portion or body 81, the body terminates in a cutting edge 141. Also, as can be seen
   in Figs. 15 and 20, the protuberance of the adaptor may be different from the protuberance of
   the nose mount with the cavity of the tooth corresponding to the different protuberance.
           In use, the nose mounts 30 are welded to the floor of the bucket in the usual manner
   and the teeth 25 are then fitted to the protuberances of the respective nose mounts.
15 Advantageously, as previously described, the protuberance 32 of the nose mount has a shape
   which is complementary to the shape of the cavity 83 formed in the tooth whereby the tooth
   can be pushed onto the nose mount with the protuberance engaging in the cavity with
   corresponding load bearing faces engaging with each other. In particular, the front face 56 of
   the nose mount protuberance engages the back face 108 of the cavity and carries most of the
20 pushing load thereon. The upper and lower faces as well as the side faces of the beak portion
   of the protuberance are arranged to engage with the corresponding faces of the beak portion
   of the cavity thereby helping to maintain alignment of the tooth on the nose mount in the
   event of undue downward, upward or sideways forces and such loads. However, the upper
   and lower faces as well as the side faces of the beak portion are not intended to be load
25 carrying faces during normal operation of the bucket 10.
           The upper and lower converging faces of the protuberance as well as the opposed side
   faces are intended to engage with the corresponding faces of the tooth cavity and are all
   intended to be load carrying faces in normal operation. Similarly, the part cylindrical faces of
   the ear lugs and ear pockets are intended to engage and to be load carrying faces in normal
30 forward operation of the bucket. Advantageously, the tapered curved corner faces, especially
   the upper corner faces are curved in a manner which prevents undesirable movement between
   the tooth and the nose mount thereby preventing yawing, that is, rotation of the tooth about a
   forwardly extending horizontal axis.

                                                      16
           The opposed openings 131 and 132 in the tooth are arranged to align with holes 61
   and 62 in the nose mount protuberance for receiving therethrough suitable pins for retaining
   the tooth on the nose mount. If desired, the depth of the blind holes 61 and 62 may be
   increased to accommodate particular styles of retaining pin or if desired, the blind holes may
 5 be drilled through the protuberance at a size to accommodate a pin extending though the
   tooth and the protuberance.
           In this embodiment of the invention, the protuberance and the cavities have been
   designed according to predetermined ratios as set out in the following table and referenced to
   Figs 11 to 19:
           Ratio created by                          Divided by                       Value
          Cone rear width d8                    Cone rear height d5                     1.3
            Beak length d2                        Cone length d3                       0.33

       Large taper radius d1IR                Small taper radius d12R                  2.86
          Cone rear width d8                 Small tapered radius d12R                   6
      Bottom Taper radius dl3R                Front Taper radius d14R                   2.5
          Taper angle d16A               (fixed value determined by other          15.50 - 16.50
                                                        ratios)
          Taper angle d1 7A                         (fixed value)                     70 - 80
10
            It is believed that the ratios given in the table provide a nose fit-up which optimises
   performance from a number of aspects. However, it is also believed that small variations
   from the ratios given will not significantly decrease performance and variations of up to
   about 20% will still result in relatively efficient and effective products.
15         While the foregoing description has been given by way of illustrative example of the
   invention, it will be understood that the invention may be embodied in many other forms and
   all such forms are deemed to fall within the broad scope and ambit of the invention as defined
   by the appended claims.
