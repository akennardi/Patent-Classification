 Title of Invention: METHOD OF PRODUCING L-AMINO ACIDS
        Technical Field
[1]       This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No.
        10-2013-0121090, filed on October 11, 2013, and Korean Patent Application No.
        10-2014-0091307, filed on July 18, 2014, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office,
        the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.
[2]       One or more embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of producing
        L-amino acids by using a gene transcription inhibition method.
        Background Art
[3]       Pyruvate, which is produced through glycolysis of various carbon sources in
        coryneform microorganisms, is converted into aspartate via oxaloacetate. The aspartate
        is converted into amino acids such as threonine, methionine, isoleucine, and lysine
        through various biosynthetic pathways (FIG. 1). Therefore, the expression of genes,
        located at each branch point in the amino acid biosynthetic processes, may be inhibited
        to decrease byproduct production and increase target amino acid production.
[4]       As described above, to develop a microorganism strain, which is capable of high
        potency production of target materials by using genetic engineering and metabolic en
        gineering, the expression of genes related with various metabolic processes of a mi
        croorganism needs to be selectively controlled. Recently, a technology for weakening
        gene expression, which is called "artificial convergent transcription", was reported
        (Krylov et al., J Mol Microbiol Biotechnol, 18:1-13, 2010). The artificial convergent
        transcription is a technology for weakening the expression of a target gene by inserting
        a promoter into a downstream region of a transcription terminator of the target gene so
        that the opposite direction of the promoter causes a collision of RNA polymerase
        complexes derived from each promoter during transcription.
[5]       The inventors developed a technology to selectively inhibit the expression of a target
        gene in the presence of acetate by inserting an acetate-inducible promoter in a direction
        opposite to the target gene transcription, and effectively applied the technology to
        inhibit the expression of genes located at branch points in a coryneform mi
        croorganism. Then the inventors verified to provide the coryneform microorganism of
        producing L-amino acid with high yield by using the technology and completed the
        present invention.

    WO 2015/053552                                                         PCT/KR2014/009468
        acids by using an acetate-inducible promoter to inhibit transcription of a target gene.
[7]       One embodiment of the present invention provides a method of producing L-amino
        acids, the method including
[8]       1) culturing a recombinant coryneform microorganism capable of producing L-amino
        acids, wherein the recombinant coryneform microorganism is transformed by inserting
        an acetate-inducible promoter to the downstream of a stop codon of a target gene in a
        chromosome; and
[9]       2) adding acetate during the culturing to weaken expression of the target gene, and to
        strengthen the L-amino acids production capability of the recombinant coryneform mi
        croorganism.
        Solution to Problem
[10]      Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which are il
        lustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like
        elements throughout. In this regard, the present embodiments may have different forms
        and should not be construed as being limited to the descriptions set forth herein. Ac
        cordingly, the embodiments are merely described below, by referring to the figures, to
        explain aspects of the present description. Expressions such as "at least one of," when
        preceding a list of elements, modify the entire list of elements and do not modify the
        individual elements of the list.
[11]
[12]      Hereinafter, the present invention is described in detail.
[13]
[14]      One embodiment of the present invention provides a method of producing L-amino
        acids, the method including
[15]      1) culturing a recombinant coryneform microorganism capable of producing L-amino
        acids, wherein the recombinant coryneform microorganism is transformed by inserting
        an acetate-inducible promoter to the downstream of a stop codon of a target gene in a
        chromosome; and
[16]      2) adding acetate during the culturing to weaken the expression of the target gene,
        and to strengthen the L-amino acids production capability of the recombinant
        coryneform microorganism.
[17]      The term "acetate-inducible promoter" used herein refers to a promoter having gene
        expression-inducing activity in the presence of acetate.
[18]      In a coryneform microorganism, acetate is converted by acetate kinase (ackA,
        NCg12656) and phosphotransacetylase (pta, NCg12657), or by succinyl-CoA:acetate
        CoA-transferase (actA, NCg12480), into acetyl CoA, and then metabolized by
        isocitrate lyase (aceA, NCg12248) in a glyoxalate cycle. In Escherichia coli, acetate is

   WO 2015/053552                                                          PCT/KR2014/009468
       converted into acetyl CoA by acetyl-CoA synthetase (acs, b4069) (Gerstmeir et al., J
       Biotechnol, 104:99-122, 2003). The expression of the mentioned genes involved in the
       acetate metabolism is induced in the presence of acetate. Therefore, when the
       promoters of the genes are used, the expression of the gene may be specifically
       induced in the presence of acetate.
[19]     Acetate-inducible promoters include a promoter of a gene encoding isocitrate lyase
       (aceA, NCg12248) or a promoter of an operon of a gene encoding acetate kinase (ackA,
       NCg12656) and a gene encoding phosphotransacetylase (pta, NCg12657), which is an
       upstream promoter of the pta gene. More specifically, among the acetate-inducible
       promoters described above, the promoter of the aceA gene is represented by nucleotide
       sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 and includes 486 base pairs in the upstream of the aceA
       gene and 36 base pairs from an N-terminal of an open reading frame (ORF).
[20]     The upstream promoter of the pta gene, which is another acetate-inducible promoter,
       is represented by nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 and includes 340 base pairs in
       the upstream of the pta gene.
[21]     In addition, it is obvious that any promoter capable of inducing a target gene ex
       pression by acetate may be included in the scope of the present invention. For example,
       the acetate-inducible promoters may include a nucleotide sequence including the nu
       cleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2, or including a conserved sequence of the nu
       cleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2, and one or a plurality of nucleotides
       (specifically 2 to 20 , more specifically, 2 to 10, further more specifically, 2 to 5 nu
       cleotides, depending on the steric conformation of amino acid residues of a protein)
       that are substituted, deleted, inserted, added, or inversed at one or more locations. As
       long as the function of the inducible promoter is maintained or strengthened, it may
       include a nucleotide sequence has more than 80% homology with the nucleotide
       sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2, specifically by more than 90%, more sepecifically by
       more than 95%, further more specifically by more than 97%. As long as the function of
       the inducible promoter is maintained, the substituted, deleted, inserted, added, or
       inversed nucleotide sequence may include a spontaneous mutant sequence or even an
       artificial mutant sequence.
[22]     The term "homology" used herein refers to the identity between two different nu
       cleotide sequences. Homology may be determined by a method known in this art by
       using a BLAST 2.0 software program which calculates such parameters as score,
       identity, and similarity. However, the method of determining homology is not limited
       thereto.
[23]     Unless mentioned otherwise herein, the term "upstream" refers to a 5'direction, and
       the term "downstream" refers to a direction.      Usually, the direction of the tran
       scription proceeding is 5' to 3' so that the promoter position is usually the upstream(5')

   WO 2015/053552                                                          PCT/KR2014/009468
       of the target gene.
[24]     Herein, a target gene in a chromosome may be a gene involved in a process of bio
       logically synthesizing amino acids such as threonine, methionine, isoleucine, and
       lysine from various carbon sources, especially a gene located at a branch point of a
       biosynthetic pathway.
[25]     For example, with respect to lysine, a pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit El (aceE,
       NCg12167) gene which is involved in the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl CoA, a
       homoserine dehydrogenase (hom, NCgl 1136) gene which produces homoserine from
       aspartate, and a UDP-N-acetylmuramoylalanyl-d-glutamate-2,6-diaminopimelate
       ligase (murE, NCg12083) gene which uses meso-2,6-diaminopimelate that is a
       precursor of lysine in somatic synthesis, are located at branch points of the biosynthetic
       pathway.
[26]     In addition, a dihydrodipicolinate synthase (dapA, NCg11896) gene involved in
       producing lysine from aspartate is at a branch point with respect to threonine, and a ho
       moserine kinase (thrB, NCgl 1137) gene involved in producing threonine from ho
       moserine is at a branch point with respect to methionine. With respect to alanine and
       valine that are pyruvate-derived amino acids, a pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit El
       (aceE, NCg12167) gene involved in the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl CoA is at a
       branch point.
[27]     Therefore, a target gene may be selected from the group consisting of a gene
       encoding a pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit El (aceE, NCg12167), a gene encoding
       homoserine dehydrogenase (hom, NCgl 1136), a gene encoding a UDP
       N-acetylmuramoylalanyl-D-glutamate-2,6-diaminopimelate ligase (murE, NCg12083),
       and a gene encoding dihydrodipicolinate synthase (dapA, NCg11896), but is not
       limited thereto.
[28]     Specifically, the pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit El (aceE, NCg12167) is one of the
       protein subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), which is involved in the
       inflow of pyruvate that is a final metabolite of glycolysis to a tricarboxylic acid cycle
       (TCA cycle). Therefore, weakening the expression of the aceE gene may decrease the
       inflow of carbon sources to a TCA cycle and increase the inflow of carbon sources to a
       lysine biosynthetic pathway to increase lysine production.
[29]     Homoserine dehydrogenase (hom, NCgl1 136) is an enzyme synthesizing homoserine
       from aspartate semialdehyde. Since aspartate semialdehyde is one of the intermediate
       precursors of a lysine biosynthetic pathway, weakening the hom gene activity may
       decrease the inflow of carbon sources to a homoserine biosynthetic pathway and
       increase the inflow of carbon sources to a lysine biosynthetic pathway to increase
       lysine production.
[30]     UDP-N-acetylmuramoylalanyl-D-glutamate-2,6-diaminopimelate ligase (murE,

   WO 2015/053552                                                        PCT/KR2014/009468
       NCg12083) uses meso-2,6-diaminopimelate for somatic synthesis. Since meso
       2,6-diaminopimelate is also used as a precursor for lysine biosynthesis, weakening of
       the murE gene activity may decrease the inflow of carbon sources to somatic synthesis
       and increase the inflow of carbon sources to a lysine biosynthetic pathway to increase
       lysine production.
[31]     Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (dapA, NCg1 1896) is an enzyme which is involved in
       lysine production by using aspartate semialdehyde. Since aspartate semialdehyde is
       one of the intermediate precursors of a lysine biosynthetic pathway, weakening of the
       dapA gene activity may decrease the inflow of carbon sources to lysine biosyntheric
       pathway and increase the inflow of carbon sources to a threonine biosynthetic pathway
       to increase threonine production.
[32]     The term "stop codon" used herein refers to codons that do not encode an amino acid
       on mRNA, but operate as a signal for termination of protein synthesis. Three codons
       including UAA, UAG, and UGA are used conventionally as stop codons.
[33]     The term "transcription terminator" used herein refers to an GC base-rich inverted
       repeat sequence. A transcription terminator forms a hairpin loop to terminate gene
       transcription.
[34]     In the present invention, to weaken the expression of a target gene, as described
       above, an acetate-inducible promoter may be introduced to a downstream of a stop
       codon of a target gene, specifically, between a stop codon and an upstream of a tran
       scription terminator. An acetate-inducible promoter may be used to cause an inverse
       transcription of a target gene so that RNA polymerase complexes may conflict with
       each other to weaken the expression of a target gene.
[35]     The expression of a target gene may be weakened any time of culturing. More
       specifically the expression of a target gene may be weakened before or during
       culturing.
[36]     The term "transformation" used herein refers to introducing a vector including a
       polynucleotide which encodes a target gene into a host cell so that a protein encoded
       by the polynucleotide may be expressed in the host cell. As long as an introduced
       polynucleotide may be expressed in a host cell, the polynucleotide may be inserted into
       the chromosome of the host cell or exist out of the chromosome. In addition, the
       polynucleotide includes DNA or RNA encoding a target protein. As long as the
       polynucleotide can be introduced into and expressed in a host cell, the polynucleotide
       may be introduced in any form.
[37]     In an embodiment of the invention, the coryneform microorganism may include mi
       croorganisms of genus Corynebacterium,genus Brevibacterium,genus Arthrobacter
       sp., and genus Microbacteriumsp.. Examples of the coryneform microorganism
       include Corynebacteriumglutamicum, Corynebacteriumthermoaminogenes, Bre-

   WO 2015/053552                                                          PCT/KR2014/009468
       vibacteriumflavum, Brevibacteriumlactofermentum, and L-amino acid-producing
       variants prepared therefrom. Specifically, the coryneform microorganism may be
       Corynebacteriumglutamicum, but is not limited to these examples.
[38]     More specifically, the coryneform microorganisms in the present invention may
       include Corynebacteriumglutamicum KCCM11016P (Former Accession NO:
       KFCC10881, Refer to Korean Patent NO: 10-0159812), Corynebacteriumglutamicum
       KCCM10770P (Refer to Korean Patent NO: 10-0924065), and Corynebacterium
       glutamicum KCCM1 1347P (Former Accession NO: KFCC 10750, Refer to Korean
       Patent NO: 10-0073610).
[39]     Corynebacteriumglutamicum CJ3P may be also included the the coryneform mi
       croorganisms in the present invention. CJ3P has been developed to have lysine
       producing capability by introducing mutation to three genes involved in lysine
       producing efficiency (pyc(P458S), hom(V59A), and lysC(T31 11)) to a parent strain, a
       wild type Corynebacteriumglutamicum (ATCC13032) according to the report by
       Binder et al. (Binder et al., Genome Biology, 13:R40, 2012).
[40]     In addition, another coryneform microorganism in the present invention may be
       Corynebacteriumglutamicum KCCM1 1222P, which is an L-threonine-producing
       strain (Refer to Korean Patent NO: 10-1335853).
[41]     According one embodiment of the present invention, in all the coryneform mi
       croorganisms to which a promoter being represented by nucleotide sequence of SEQ
       ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 2 was introduced, the L-lysine or L-threonine productivity
       was increased comprare to that of the parent strain.
[42]     With respect to the method provided in the present invention, culturing of a
       coryneform microorganism may be performed by applying any culturing conditions
       and culturing method known in this art.
[43]     A culture medium, which may be used in culturing of a coryneform strain, may be,
       for example, the culture mediums described in Manual of Methods for General Bac
       teriology by the American Society for Bacteriology (Washington D.C., USA, 1981).
[44]     The carbon sources, which may be used in the culture medium, may include a car
       bohydrate such as glucose, saccharose, lactose, fructose, maltose, starch, and cellulose,
       an oil or lipid such as soybean oil, sunflower oil, castor oil, and coconut oil, a fatty
       acid such as palmitic acid, stearic acid, and linoleic acid, an alcohol such as glycerol
       and ethanol, and an organic acid such as acetic acid. These substances may be indi
       vidually or as a mixture.
[45]     The nitrogen sources, which may be used in the culture medium, may include
       peptone, yeast extract, beef extract, malt extract, corn steep liquid, soybean, and urea,
       and an inorganic nitrogen source such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride,
       ammonium phosphate, ammonium carbonate, and ammonium nitrate. These nitrogen

    WO 2015/053552                                                       PCT/KR2014/009468
        sources also may be individually or as a mixture.
[46]      The phosphorous sources, which may be used in the culture medium, may include
        potassium dihydrogen phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, and a sodium
        containing salt thereof. In addition, a culture medium may have to include a metal salt
        such as magnesium sulfate and iron sulfate needed for growth. Beside the substances
        described above, necessary substances for growth such as amino acids and vitamins
        may be used. In addition, appropriate precursors may be used in a culture medium. The
        raw materials may be added to the culture solution in a batch mode or a continuous
        mode during the culturing.
[47]      During the culturing of the microorganism, the pH of the culture medium may be
        adjusted by adding a basic compound such as ammonium hydroxide, potassium
        hydroxide, and ammonia, or an acidic compound such as phosphoric acid and sulfuric
        acid to the culture medium in an appropriate mode. In addition, bubble formation may
        be repressed by using an anti-forming agent such as fatty acid polyglycol ester. To
        maintain aerobic conditions, oxygen or an oxygen-containing gas (for example, air)
        may be injected to the culture medium. The temperature of the culture medium may be
        usually from about 20 'C to about 45 'C, specifically, from about 25 'C to about 40 'C.
        The culturing may continue until a desired amount of an L-amino acid is produced, but
        an appropriate culturing time may be from about 10 to 160 hours.
[48]      With respect to the method provided in the present invention, culturing may be
        performed in a continuous mode or a batch mode such as a batch process, a fed-batch
        process, and a repeated fed-batch process. These culturing methods are known in the
        art, and any of the culturing methods may be used.
[49]      The term "culturing" used herein may include both preparing a culture medium and
        the time during growing the microorganisms.
[50]      With respect to the method provided in the present invention, the method may
        include further purifying or recovering step. A target L-amino acid may be purified or
        recovered from a culture solution by using an appropriate method known in this art
        according to the method such as batch culturing, continuous culturing, and fed-batch
        culturing.
[51]      An L-amino acid produced in the culturing of the present invention may be one
        selected from the group consisting of threonine, methionine, isoleucine, lysine, valine,
        and alanine, specifically, lysine or threonine.

        Mode for the Invention
[55]      Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in further detail with reference to
        examples. These examples are illustrative purposes only and the scope of the present
        invention is not limited thereto.
[56]
[57]      Examples
[58]
[59]      Example 1: Selection of Acetate-Inducible Promoter
[60]      Isocitrate lyase (aceA, NCg12248) is a key enzyme of a glyoxylate cycle, and a gene
        encoding isocitrate lyase is expressed in the presence of acetate. In addition, acetate
        kinase (ackA, NCg12656) and phosphotransacetylase (pta, NCg12657), which are
        enzymes that are involved in an acetate metabolic process, form an operon, and the ex
        pression thereof is strengthened in the presence of acetate. The promoter regions of the
        aceA gene and the pta-ackA operon are already known (Gerstmeir et al., J Biotechnol,
        104, 99-122, 2003).
[61]      In Example 1, a promoter of the aceA gene and a promoter of the pta-ack operon that

        of a target gene in the presence of acetate. Based on the aceA gene registered in the US
        NIH GenBank (NCBI Registration NO: NCg12248), a nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID
        NO: 1), including 486 base pairs in the upstream of the aceA gene and 36 base pairs
        from an N-terminal of an open reading frame (ORF), was obtained. In addition, based
        on the pta gene registered in the US NIH GenBank (NCBI Registration NO:
        NCg12657), a nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO: 2), including 340 base pairs in the
        upstream of the pta gene, was obtained.

[63]      Example 2: Preparation of Vector for Inhibiting aceE Gene Expression
[64]      A pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit El (aceE, NCgl2167) is one of the protein
        subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), which is involved in inflowing
        pyruvate that is a final metabolite of glycolysis to a TCA cycle. Therefore, weakening
        the expression of the aceE gene may decrease the inflow of carbon sources to a TCA
        cycle and increase the inflow of carbon sources to a lysine biosynthetic pathway to

       increase lysine production (Blombach et al., Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 76(3):615-23,
       2007).
[65]     The aceA gene promoter was inserted to the downstream of the aceE gene so that the
       transcription from this promoter may occur in a direction opposite to the original
       direction of the aceE gene transcription to inhibit the expression of the aceE gene se
       lectively in the presence of acetate (FIG. 2).
[66]     Firstly, CLC main workbench software (CLC Bio, Denmark) was used to predict a
       transcription terminator of the aceE gene. A transcription terminator is a GC base-rich
       inverted repeat sequence and forms a hairpin loop to terminate gene transcription. The
       result of predicting a transcription terminator of the aceE gene showed that 36 base
       pairs, from the 21st base pair to the 56th base pair in the downstream from the stop
       codon of the aceE gene, form a hairpin loop as a transcription terminator. Based on this
       result, two vectors were prepared to insert aceE promoter into either the upstream or
       the downstream, respectively, of the transcription terminator of aceE gene so that the
       transcription from the this promoter may occur in a opposite direction of the original
       one.
[67]     <2-1> Preparation of pDZ-aceEl-PaceA Vector for Inhibiting aceE Gene Expression
[68]     A vector was prepared by inserting an aceA gene promoter to the downstream of the
       aceE gene stop codon, which is between the stop codon and the upstream of the tran
       scription terminator.
[69]     To obtain a fragment of a Corynebacteriumglutamicum-derived aceE gene, the
       chromosomal DNA of Corynebacteriumglutamicum KCCM11016P was used as a
       template to synthesize primers (SEQ ID NOs: 3 and 4), which were designed to have
       an XbaI restriction enzyme recognition site at a 5'end of the fragment and an Spel re
       striction enzyme recognition site at a 3'end of the fragment. A PCR was performed by
       using the synthesized primers to obtain a DNA fragment including 296 base pairs
       between the 2474th nucleotide from the start codon of aceE gene and the 2769th nu
       cleotide, a stop codon of aceE gene. In addition, primers (SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6),
       which were designed to have an Spel recognition site at a 5'end of the fragment and an
       XbaI recognition site at a 3'end of the fragment were synthesized, and a PCR was
       performed by using the primers to obtain a DNA fragment including 300 base pairs in
       the downstream of the aceE gene stop codon. PfuUltraTM High-Fidelity DNA
       Polymerase (Stratagene) was used as a polymerase, and a PCR was performed with 30
       cycles of denaturing at 95'C for 30 seconds; annealing at 55'C for 30 seconds; and

       different from that of the parent strain KCCM 1101 6P.
[115]    However, as shown in Table 2, in the presence of acetate, the L-lysine productivity of

       KCCM11016P::aceEl-PaceA strain in which the aceA promoter was inserted to the
       upstream of the aceE gene transcription terminator, which was between the stop codon

       the region between the stop codon and the upstream of the transcription terminator
       may be used to inhibit gene expression more effectively.

[118]    Example 5 : Preparation of pDZ-aceE-Ppta Vector for Inhibiting aceE Gene Ex
       pression
[119]    Acetate kinase (ackA, NCg12656) and phosphotransacetylase (pta, NCg12657), which
       are enzymes that are involved in an acetate metabolic process, form an operon, and the
       expression thereof is strengthened in the presence of acetate. Therefore, when the
       promoters of the genes are used, the expression of a gene may be specifically induced
       in the presence of acetate.
[120]    In Example 5, to inhibit the expression of the aceE gene in the presence of acetate, a
       vector for using a pta-ack operon promoter that was the pta gene upstream promoter
       region was prepared.
[121]    To inhibit the expression of the aceE gene, a vector which may comprise a pta gene
       promoter in the downstream of the aceE gene stop codon, which is between the stop
       codon and the upstream of the transcription terminator, was constructed so that the
       transcription from pta gene promoter may occur in a direction opposite to the original
       direction of the aceE gene transcription.
[122]    To obtain a fragment of a Corynebacteriumglutamicum-derived aceE gene, the

[136]    In addition, since the L-lysine productivity of the KCCM11016P::aceEl-PaceA
       strain was higher than that of the KCCM11016P::aceEl-Ppta strain, in the presence of
       acetate, the expression of a target gene may be inhibited more effectively by using the
       aceA gene promoter than by using the pta gene promoter.

[139]    Three L-lysine-producing strains which were Corynebacteriumglutamicum
       KFCC10750, KCCM10770P, and CJ3P were transformed respectively with the pDZ
       aceEl-PaceA vector prepared in Example 2 by the same method as Example 3. The
       strains in which an aceA gene promoter was inserted to the downstream of the aceE
       gene stop codon on the chromosome so that the transcription may occur in a direction
       opposite to the original direction of the aceE gene transcription was selected by
       performing a PCR. The obtained three L-lysine-producing strains were
       KFCC10750::aceEl-PaceA, KCCM10770P::aceEl-PaceA, and CJ3P::aceEl-PaceA.
       The prepared strains were verified that the nucleotide sequence of target region

[145]    However, as shown in Table 6, in the presence of acetate, the L-lysine productivity of

       strain.
[146]
[147]    Example 8 : Preparation of Vector for Inhibiting hom Gene Expression
[148]    L-threonine biosynthetic pathway using a same substrate as L-lysine biosynthetic
       pathway may be weakened to increase L-lysine productivity. An example of the
       methods of weakening L-threonine biosynthetic pathway is to decrease the enzymatic
       activity of homoserine dehydrogenase (hom, NCg1 1136) which produces homoserine
       from aspartate.
[149]    In Corynebacteriumglutamicum, the hom gene forms hom-thrB operon with thrB
       gene, and the transcription terminator of the hom gene exists in the downstream of the
       thrB gene. It was reported that a promoter exists in the upstream of the hom-thrB
       operon that is the upstream of the hom gene. In addition, it was reported a second
       promoter exists in the upstream of the thrB gene operon (Mateos et al., J Bacteriol,
       176:7362-7371, 1994). Therefore, an aceA gene promoter was inserted to the
       downstream of the hom gene stop codon so that the trascription from this promoter
       may occur in a direction opposite to the original direction of the hom gene tran-

   WO 2015/053552                                                         PCT/KR2014/009468
       scription in order to selectively inhibit the expression of the hom gene in the presence
       of acetate. To maintain the expression of the thrB gene, a second promoter sequence
       was added to the upstream of thrB gene ORF.
[150]    In Example 8, a recombinant vector was prepared by inserting an aceA gene
       promoter between the downstream of the hom gene stop codon and the upstream of the
       thrB gene.
[151]    To obtain a fragment of a Corynebacteriumglutamicum-derivedhom gene, the
       chromosomal DNA of Corynebacteriumglutamicum KCCM11016P was used as a
       template, and primers, which were designed to have an XbaI restriction enzyme
       recognition site at a 5'end of the fragment and an Spel restriction enzyme recognition
       site at a 3'end of the fragment (SEQ ID NOs: 17 and 18), were synthesized. A PCR
       was performed using the synthesized primers to obtain a DNA fragment including 300
       base pairs between the 1039th nucleotide from the hom gene start codon and the
        1338th nucleotide which was a stop codon. Even when an aceA is inserted between the
       hom-thrB operons, the expression of the thrB gene should be maintained. Therefore,
       when the DNA fragment including the 300 base pairs of the hom gene stop codon
       downstream was prepared, primers which were designed to further add a thrB
       promoter sequence of 32 base pairs to a 5'side (SEQ ID NOs: 19 and 20) were syn
       thesized. A PCR was performed using these primers (SEQ ID NOs: 19 and 20) to
       obtain a DNA fragment of 334 base pairs having an Spel restriction enzyme
       recognition site at a 5'end of the fragment and an XbaI restriction enzyme recognition
       site at a 3'end of the fragment. The PCR was performed under the same conditions as
       Example 2.
[152]    The two PCR amplification products and a pDZ vector for chromosomal introduction
       that had already been prepared by cleaving with an XbaI restriction enzyme were
       cloned by using an In-fusion Cloning Kit (TAKARA, JP) to prepare a pDZ-hom
       vector.

       the downstream of the hom gene stop codon on the chromosome so that the tran

       transcription was selected by performing a PCR to obtain an L-lysine-producing strain,

[172]
[173]    Example 10: Preparation of Vector for Inhibiting murE Gene Expression
[174]    UDP-N-acetylmuramoylalanyl-D-glutamate-2,6-diaminopimelate ligase (murE,
       NCg12083) uses meso-2,6-diaminopimelate, which is a precursor for lysine
       biosynthesis, in somatic synthesis. Weakening of the murE gene activity may decrease
       the inflow of carbon sources to somatic synthesis and increase the inflow of carbon
       sources to a lysine biosynthetic pathway to increase lysine production.
[175]    In Corynebacteriumglutamicum, the murE gene (NCg12083) forms an operon with
       seven genes from NCg12076 to NCg12082. The transcription of the operon starts from
       the NCg12083 murE in the direction of the NCg12076 gene. So, a transcription
       terminator exists in the downstream of the NCg12076 gene. Therefore, an aceA gene
       promoter was inserted to the downstream of the murE gene stop codon so that the tran
       scription may occurin a direction opposite to the original direction of the murE gene
       transcription in order to selectively inhibit the expression of the murE gene in the
       presence of acetate. To maintain the expression of the other seven genes except the
       murE gene which is located in the first region of the operon, a murE operon promoter
       was further added to the upstream of the NCg12082 gene ORF.
[176]    In Example 10, a recombinant vector was prepared by inserting an aceA gene
       promoter to the downstream of the murE gene stop codon.
[177]    To obtain a fragment of a Corynebacteriumglutamicum-derived murE gene, the

       recognition site at a 5'end of the fragment and an XhoI restriction enzyme recognition
       site at a 3'end of the fragment (SEQ ID NOs: 23 and 24), were synthesized. A PCR
       was performed using the synthesized primers to obtain a DNA fragment including 300
       base pairs between the 1267th nucleotide from the murE gene start codon and the
        1566th nucleotide which was a stop codon. In addition, primers, which were designed
       to have an XhoI restriction enzyme recognition site at a 5'end of the fragment and an
       XbaI restriction enzyme recognition site at a 3'end of the fragment (SEQ ID NOs: 25
       and 26), were synthesized. A PCR was performed using the synthesized primers to
       obtain a DNA fragment including 292 base pairs from the 10th nucleotide in the
       downstream of the murE gene stop codon. The PCR was performed under the same
       conditions as Example 2. The two PCR amplification products and a pDZ vector for
       chromosomal introduction that had already been prepared by cleaving with an XbaI re
       striction enzyme were cloned by using an In-fusion Cloning Kit (TAKARA, JP) to
       prepare a pDZ-murE vector.

       recognition site at a 3'end of the fragment (SEQ ID NOs: 29 and 30), were syn
       thesized. A PCR was performed using the synthesized primers to obtain a DNA
       fragment including 300 base pairs in the upstream of murE gene ORF.

[192]    Example 11: Preparation of Strains to Which aceA Gene Promoter is Inserted
       to Downstream of murE Gene and Comparison of Lysine Productivity thereof
[193]    The Corynebacteriumglutamicum KCCM1 1016P was transformed with the pDZ
       murE-PaceA-PmurEvector prepared in Example 10 by the same method as Example 3.
[194]    The strain in which an aceA gene promoter was inserted to the downstream of the
       murE gene stop codon on the chromosome so that the transcription may occur in a
       direction opposite to the original direction of the murE gene transcription was selected
       by performing a PCR to obtain an L-lysine-producing strain, which was named as
       KCCM11016P::murE-PaceA-PmurE. The prepared
       KCCM11016P::murE-PaceA-PmurE strain was verified that the nucleotide sequences
       of target region obtained was analyzed by performing a PCR using SEQ ID NO: 23
       and SEQ ID NO: 26 as primers.

       strain and the prepared KCCM1 1016P::murE-PaceA-PmurE strain were cultured by
       the same method as Example 4, and the concentration of L-lysine recovered from the
       culture solutions was measured. When acetate was not added, the L-lysine con
       centration in the culture solutions of the Corynebacteriumglutamicum KCCM11016P
       strain and the KCCM11016P::murE-PaceA-PmurE strain is shown in Table 9.

[199]    As shown in Table 9, in the absence of acetate, the L-lysine productivity of the
       KCCM1 1016P::murE-PaceA-PmurE strain was not different from that of the parent
       strain KCCM11016P.
[200]    However, as shown in Table 10, in the presence of acetate, the L-lysine productivity
       of the KCCM11016P::murE-PaceA-PmurE strain was over 2.8% higher than that of
       the parent strain KCCM11016P.

[202]    Example 12: Preparation of Vector for Inhibiting dapA Gene Expression
[203]    L-lysine biosynthetic pathway using the same substrate as L-threonine biosynthetic
       pathway may be weakened to increase L-threonine productivity. An example of the
       methods of weakening L-lysine biosynthetic pathway is to decrease the enzymatic
       activity of dihydrodipicolinate synthase (dapA, NCg11896) which is involved in the
       production of lysine from aspartate.
[204]    In Corynebacteriumglutamicum, the dapA gene forms dapA-ORF4 operon with
       ORF4 (NCg1 1895) gene, and thus the transcription terminator of the dapA gene exists
       in the downstream of the ORF4 gene. In addition, it was reported that a promoter exists
       in the upstream of the dapA-ORF4 operon that is the upstream of the dapA gene, and a
       second promoter exists in the upstream of the ORF4 gene (Patek et al., Biotechnology
       letters, 19:1113-1117, 1997). Therefore, an aceA gene promoter was inserted to the
       downstream of the dapA gene stop codon so that the transcription may occur in a
       direction opposite to the original direction of the dapA gene transcription in order to
       selectively inhibit the expression of the dapA gene in the presence of acetate. To
       maintain the expression of the ORF4 gene, a promoter region sequence of about 100
       base pairs in the ORF4 gene upstream was added to the ORF upstream of the ORF4
       gene.
[205]    In Example 12, a recombinant vector was prepared by inserting an aceA gene
       promoter to the downstream of the dapA gene stop codon.
[206]    To obtain a fragment of a Corynebacteriumglutamicum-derived dapA gene, the
       chromosomal DNA of Corynebacteriumglutamicum KCCM11016P was used as a

   WO 2015/053552                                                         PCT/KR2014/009468
       template, and primers, which were designed to have an XbaI restriction enzyme
       recognition site at a 5'end of the fragment and an Spel restriction enzyme recognition
       site at a 3'end of the fragment (SEQ ID NOs: 31 and 32), were synthesized. A PCR
       was performed using the synthesized primers to obtain a DNA fragment including 301
       base pairs between the 606th nucleotide from the dapA gene start codon and the 906th
       nucleotide which was a stop codon. In addition, primers, which were designed to have
       an Spel restriction enzyme recognition site at a 5'end of the fragment and an XbaI re
       striction enzyme recognition site at a 3'end of the fragment (SEQ ID NOs: 33 and 34),
       were synthesized. Through a PCR, a DNA fragment which further includes a promoter
       region sequence of about 100 base pairs between the 809th nucleotide from the dapA
       gene start codon and the 2nd nucleotide in the stop codon downstream, to maintain the
       expression of the ORF4 gene, and 213 base pairs in the dapA gene stop codon
       downstream was obtained. The PCR was performed under the same conditions as
       Example 2. The two PCR amplification products and a pDZ vector for chromosomal
       introduction that had already been prepared by cleaving with an XbaI restriction
       enzyme were cloned by using an In-fusion Cloning Kit (TAKARA, JP) to prepare a
       pDZ-dapA vector.

       The PCR was performed using the chromosomal DNA of Corynebacterium

       promoter region of about 500 base pairs being represented by a nucleotide sequence of

       to Downstream of dapA Gene and Comparison of Threonine Productivity thereof
[219]    To verify the effect of inhibiting the dapA gene expression in an L
       threonine-producing strain, the pDZ-dapA-PaceA vector prepared in Example 12 was
       transformed by the same method as Example 3 into a Corynebacteriumglutamicum
       KCCM1 1222P (Korean Patent NO: 2013-0061570) strain that is an L
       threonine-producing strain. The strain in which an aceA gene promoter was inserted to
       the downstream of the dapA gene stop codon on the chromosome so that the tran
       scription may occur in a direction opposite to the original direction of the dapA gene
       transcription was selected by performing a PCR, which was named as
       KCCM1 1222P::dapA-PaceA. The prepared KCCM1 1222P::dapA-PaceA strain was
       verified that the nucleotide sequence of target region obtained was analyzed by
       performing a PCR by using SEQ ID NO: 31 and SEQ ID NO: 34 as primers.
[220]    The Corynebacteriumglutamicum KCCM1 1222P strain, which was used as a parent
       strain, and the prepared KCCM1 1222P::dapA-PaceA strain were cultured by the
       method described below.
[221]    Each of the strains was respectively inoculated 25 ml of a seed medium in 250 ml
       corner-baffled flasks, followed by shaking culture at 200rpm at 30 'C for 20 hours.
       Afterward, 1 ml of the seed culture solution was added to a 250 ml corner-baffled flask
       including 24 ml of a production medium, followed by shaking culture at 200rpm at 30
       'C for 48 hours at 200 rpm. The respective compositions of the seed medium and the
