ABSTRACT
Provided is         an electrical system 10                       for operatively driving a
pump      18.   The    system        10    comprises          a    prime      mover       12   having      a
controllable          mechanical            output,       and       an   electrical           generator
14     mechanically            coupled         to     the      prime        mover        output.         The
generator 14          operatively generates electrical power and has a
controllable          excitation           system whereby               the     generator        voltage
output        is    controllable.               Also      included            is      an    electrical
induction motor 16 operatively supplied with electrical power
from the electrical generator 14,                            and a pump 18 driven by the
induction         motor        16      for      operatively             displacing            fluid.       A
controller        20    of     the     system       10    is      programmed           with    a   speed
torque relationship                of both the prime mover 12                          and induction
motor 16,        as   well as a performance curve of the pump                                    18.     The
controller          20     is    configured             to     continuously              monitor         the
operating         characteristics                 of      the         prime       mover        12,       the
electrical generator                 14,      the induction motor 16                     and the pump
18,     and    to   automatically              and    dynamically              control       the    prime
mover       output     and     excitation           system         in    order       to    dynamically
and     continuously          match       the    speed-torque              relationship           of     the
prime mover 12 to that of the induction motor 16 and the pump
performance          curve.       In     this     manner,           optimal        energy      transfer
efficiency        through         the      system       10    can      be    facilitated           whilst
user-selectable              fluid       flow     rate,         fluid       pressure         and     fluid
level are maintainable when displacing fluid via the pump 18.

          AN ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FOR DRIVING A PUMP
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001]       This      invention       relates           to     the      field      of   electrical
engineering,       in   general,       and      in     particular              to   an   electrical
system for operatively driving a pump.
BACKGROUND ART
[0002]       The     following       discussion              of     the      background          art  is
intended    to      facilitate          an     understanding                    of    the      present
invention    only.      The    discussion           is      not      an     acknowledgement           or
admission    that       any    of   the      material             referred          to    is     or  was
part   of the common general knowledge as at the priority date
of the   application.
[0003]       There      are    millions        of      electrical              motors      in    use  in
industry    and       offices       around         the        world.           Such     motors       may
operate    mining        dewatering            pumps,            sewage          and      irrigation
pumps,    milking       machines       and      ski       lifts,          paper      machines        and
power-plant     fans,      sawmill       conveyors             and      hospital        ventilation
systems,   to    name     just    a   few examples.                  It    has     been     estimated
that    in  the       vicinity       of      sixty-five                percent         or     more    of
industrial      electrical           energy           is       consumed            by    electrical
motors.
[0004]       In    many     cases,     these         electrical              motors      operate      at
a  constant    speed      while     fed by         static          frequency          and     voltage.
in   other    cases,       these      electrical               motors          are     required       to
operate    at     variable        speed        fed        by      dynamic          frequency         and
voltage.     The       later      method          uses           solid         state         switching

                                                          2
methodologies             for      starting           and controlling             such motors,          e.g.
pulse      width        modulation,               etc.       Such       practices       are      generally
inefficient           from an energy point of view.
 [0005]           For example,               a solid state motor soft                      starter is        a
device        used with           AC    electrical             motors       to   temporarily         reduce
the     voltage        amplitude            which       consequently            reduce      the     current
applied        to    the       motor        during         start-up.          This    can      reduce    the
associated mechanical and electrodynamic                                       stresses and extend
the       lifespan           of       the       system.            In      general,        starting       an
induction motor is                   accompanied by inrush currents                            up to 7-10
times higher than running current,                                   and starting torque up to
3    times       higher         than        running          torque.         The   increased         torque
results         in    sudden          mechanical              stress        on   the    machine        which
leads      to     a   reduced          service         life.         Moreover,      the     high     inrush
current stresses the power                            supply, which may lead to                     voltage
dips.      As     a    result,          lifespan           of     sensitive        equipment         may  be
reduced.
 [0006]           Accordingly,                solid        state        devices      can     be    used   to
control        the     voltage           applied        to      a    motor,     but    to    accommodate
the     large       currents          and voltages               involved       at   start-up,         these
solid      state       starters           must      generally           be    designed      with     a  much
higher electrical rating than                               required for normal operation,
and     the      generator           must       be     much        higher      rated      than     a   motor
which       it    drives,          typically            in      the     order     of    a   250% rating
increase.
 [0007]            The     present           invention             seeks      to   propose        possible
solutions,           at     least        in     part,        in     amelioration          of    the    known
shortcomings in the art.

 [0008]           According          to    an   aspect       of    the     invention           there     is
provided          an    electrical            system       for      operatively              driving        a

prime        mover      output,         said     generator          operatively              generating

          a   pump     driven        by     the    induction         motor       for      operatively
displacing          fluid,        pump      operating        characteristics                 comprising
a     measurable           fluid       flow      rate,      fluid        pressure            and      fluid
level;        and
          a      controller               programmed             with          a        speed-torque
relationship           of both the prime mover                     and induction              motor     and
a   performance            curve      of    the   pump,      said     controller             configured
to:
          i)      continuously            monitor       operating           characteristics              of
                  the      prime       mover,       the     electrical            generator,            the
                  induction motor and the pump;                        and
          ii)     automatically              and     dynamically            control          the      prime
                  mover       output         and    excitation           system         in     order     to
                  dynamically             and     continuously              match         the      speed
                  torque       relationship           of   the     prime       mover        to   that    of
                  the       induction          motor       and      the       pump        performance
                  curve;
so      that      optimal         energy        transfer         efficiency             through         the
system         is     facilitated            whilst       user-selectable                 fluid        flow

                                                            4
rate,       fluid        pressure            and     fluid       level       are     maintainable          when
displacing fluid via the pump.
 [0009]             The       skilled             addressee           will       appreciate           that     a
speed-torque              relationship                of    either       the      prime    mover        or  the
induction           motor       may       vary       depending          on    prime     mover       or   motor
design          and      is     generally              indicative            of     desired       operating
ranges        for     a    specific           prime       mover      or motor         having      increased
power        efficiency.              It       is    also       to     be     appreciated          that     the
performance              curve          of       a    pump       provides           an   indication          of
producible           pressure relational                       to producible           fluid flow          rate
and        a       desired            operating                range         delivering           maximised
efficiency for such variables.
 [0010]             In      light          hereof,         by       dynamically          matching          such
speed-torque                relationships                 and       performance          curves         whilst
maintaining                   the               user-selectable                     pump          operating
characteristics,                     allows            for       efficient            energy         transfer
through          the       system.           As     an     energy         source       for     the      system
typically           comprises            a    fuel      source       for     the    prime     mover,       such

solely          for      the        purposes           of     exemplifying             the      present
invention           to      the        skilled          addressee. It              should       not     be
understood          as    a restriction              on the broad            summary,      disclosure
or    description             of    the     invention          as     set      out   above.       In   the
figures,         incorporated             to   illustrate          features         of   the     example

 [0047]           Referring           now     to      Figure       1,     there      is     shown      one
example of          an electrical system 10                      for operatively driving a
pump     18.     The     system        10   generally         comprises          a prime       mover    12
having       a    controllable             mechanical          output,          and  a    synchronous
three       (3)    phase       alternating            current       electrical          generator       14
mechanically            coupled          to   the       prime     mover        output,      as     shown.

                                                      12
The     generator          14   operatively            generates          electrical            power        and
has      a  controllable             excitation           system       whereby          the      generator
voltage          output         is      controllable.               When        combined             with        a
suitable         controller          20,      described         in    more      detail         below,        the
prime       mover        12,    generator           14     and     controller             20     typically
form a generator assembly 34,                          as    shown.
 [0048]           The       system        10     finds       typical,           yet      non-limiting,
application               in     mining           water         management,                particularly
dewatering           applications,                such      as     in      an      open       pit      or      an
underground             mine.        Below         surface         water        management               is      a
critical          operation,             utilised           extensively              in      the       mining
industry          to      remove        or     lower       aquifer           water       levels          in      a
controllable               manner,          by      pumping          the        water         out        using
purposely           build        pumps          generally           driven           by      three-phase
induction          motors       directly          coupled        to    a    pump.       Other        related
application           includes          injecting          an    amount        of     water       into       the
ground         into        purposely            drilled          holes         called          wellbores.
Another        application           is     where     the     pump      is     above-ground,               such
as     in     a    transfer          station,          to     maintain            a    desired           flow,
pressure, temperature or level.
 [0049]           These          pumps            generally             require              three-phase
electrical          power       to    drive        them     and     in     typical         installation
locations,           mains      grid       power      is     not     available.            It     is     known
that       electrical           generators           provide         electrical             power         at     a
frequency of 50Hz                or     60Hz,      depending on the applicable                           local
regulation.            In     a   steady         state       operation,            at    the       supplied
frequency,           a    pump      will       deliver        a    relatively             stable         flow,
pressure or temperature.

                                                        13
 [0050]          If       any      of     these        pump       operating             characteristics
require        variation,                then       at      least         one        of      the       process
parameters,               being           operating              characteristics                    of        the
components         driving the pump, has                       to change            in a controllable
manner.          Typically,                the        most        important               parameter            or
characteristic               of     that       pump       that      needs         to     be     changed        is
fluid        flow      rate,         and       this       parameter           can       be     changed         in
multiple         ways:          by      throttling            a     flow        control          valve,        by
controlling              the        pump         delivery           rate         via        limiting           or
controlling           the       power       and      frequency          supplied          thereto,          etc.
In      the     present             invention,             by     restricting                any       process
parameters,            flow        or     electrical            power,         the       overall         system
efficiency          and      reliability              are    reduced          proportional              to    the
type of restriction utilised.
 [0051]          Accordingly,                 the       system          10      also         includes          an
electrical            induction            motor         16     operatively               supplied          with
electrical          power          from      the      electrical            generator           14,      and     a
pump       18  driven          by     the      induction          motor        16      for     operatively
displacing          fluid.          Operating          characteristics                  of   the      pump     18
generally         comprise              a    measurable             fluid         flow       rate,        fluid
pressure        and      fluid        level.        As    described           above,        the     motor      16
and pump 18           generally form part of                       a pumping package 36                     as a
wellbore        or     transfer           station         pumping         installation.               Such     an
installation               typically             includes           so-called              headworks           30
influenced          by     pump       operating           characteristics                 of    fluid       flow
rate,         pressure,                temperature,                 etc.           These           operating
characteristics                 are      generally          measured           or      monitored           by    a
controller           20       of     the        system        10,       typically            via       control
feedback       into       a    suitable         interface         panel,         such as         a   junction
box 32,       or the like.

 [0052]          The     controller            20    of     the      system        10    is    programmed
with     a    speed-torque          relationship               of both         the     prime      mover        12
and     induction         motor       16,      as    well       as     a   performance            curve        of
the      pump     18.       The      controller              20      is      then       configured             to
continuously            monitor         the      operating            characteristics                 of     the
prime       mover     12,     the     electrical             generator           14,     the     induction
motor         16   and       the       pump         18,       and        to     automatically                and
dynamically           control         the      prime        mover        output        and     excitation
system        in  order        to    dynamically              and      continuously             match        the
speed-torque           relationship              of    the      prime       mover       12    to    that       of
the     induction         motor       16     and     the      pump       performance            curve.         In
this     manner,       optimal         energy        transfer           efficiency           through         the
system        10   can     be     facilitated              whilst         user-selectable                fluid
flow      rate,     fluid       pressure           and     fluid        level       are     maintainable
when displacing fluid via the pump 18.
 [0053]          The       skilled           addressee           will         appreciate             that        a
speed-torque           relationship              of     either         the      prime       mover       12     or
the     induction        motor       16 may         vary depending               on prime         mover        or
motor         design        and       is       generally             indicative              of      desired
operating        ranges        for     a    specific         prime        mover      or     motor      having
increased         power       efficiency.              It     is     also       to     be    appreciated
that       the    performance              curve        of      the       pump       18     provides           an

 [0055]             The prime mover 12                     typically comprises                    an   internal

 [0056]             Typically,                   the            prime               mover            operating
characteristics                 continuously               monitored           by the       controller           are
selected            from        a    group         consisting              of      oil      pressure,            oil

 [0057]             The      controller              20     is      configured            to     control         the
mechanical            output         of    the      prime       mover        by    varying         any    of     the
suitable            operating             characteristics.                    In     one      example,           the
prime       mover       12     comprises           a    diesel        engine        with     a    governor        or
engine         control          unit        (ECU)         28    which        can      interface          with        a
large        numbers           of     sensors           within         the       engine         12.     In     this
manner,         the      controller              20     has      the      ability         to      monitor        and

RS484, as is            known in the art.
 [0058]           In     one      example,         communication              between       ECU    28   and
the      controller            20      is    typically            via     a     CAN    bus     utilizing
various         protocols,            such    as     VP,    MTU,      J1939,       J   1850,     KWP2000,

parameters          and commands             are      generally received and sent                     from
the        controller             20      at     a     very         high        speed,        minimizing
substantially               the       wiring        requirements,              system       efficiency,
and        reliability,                and     maximizing              the       uptime.        CAN    bus
communication              between         controller           20    and     engine       12   impose    a
clear       and     distinctive             advantage           in     controlling           the    engine
rotational          speed,         torque       and      fuel      consumption,           the    ultimate

[0061]              The       controller             20       is      generally            configured           to
control the              excitation system of the generator                                  14 by varying
any       of      the        suitable            operating             characteristics                 of     the

[0062]              In a preferred embodiment,                          the      system 10 generally
includes          switchgear             24     electrically             coupling           the     generator

induction motor 16,                    as required, as a safety feature.
[0063]              In     one     example,          the      system       10    uses       a   synchronous

 [0064]             The      alternator           voltage           can       be   adjusted          via       the

Depending            on    requirements,              the      rated         output     voltage         can      be

 [0065]             It    is     to    be   appreciated             that       the   primary        function
of      the      voltage           regulator           22     is       to      maintain        a    constant

 [0067]            The       electrical           induction          motor         16      generally
comprises              a     squirrel-cage              winding         configuration.                   The
electrical              motor      operating            characteristics               continuously
monitored            by     the    controller            are    selected          from        a     group
consisting           of    nominal      voltage,          nominal      current,        a    frequency
range,          lock       rotor      current,          power       factor        and      operating
efficiency.
 [0068]            The     pump    can    be     selected      from       a   group       consisting
of    a    centrifugal          pump,      a   reciprocating            pump,      a     centrifugal
fan,       a   blower        and   a   compressor,           but     other       types       of      fluid
movers         may       also    be    used.        Typically,          the      pump       operating
characteristics               continuously          monitored        by the       controller             are
selected          from     a   group     consisting         of    fluid      flow      rate,         fluid
pressure,           fluid      level,       pump       acceleration          and      deceleration

time,   pump     frequency,            pump        rotational           speed      ranges,         and
overall    pump        hydraulic            performance.               The   controller             20
generally     takes        into       consideration               the     acceleration             and
deceleration         time,        pump        process            values,        frequency           or
rotational      speed       ranges          and      the       overall      pump         hydraulic
performance.
[0069]      The       controller             20      can        comprise         any      suitable
central     processing              unit          having          electronic             circuitry
configured     to     perform         arithmetic,             logical,       control          and/or
input/output         (I/0)     operations             as      specified        by       a    set    of
instructions.           Typically,             the        controller             comprises             a
programmable         logic      controller               (PLC).        The    controller            20
generally    also       comprises          a    remote        monitoring          interface         26
for remotely monitoring and/or controlling the system 10.
[0070]      in    one     example,          the      controller          20   is     based       on    a
SICES   generator         controller            DST4602          Evolution         with        colour
screen  human machine            interface           (HMI)      with programmable               logic
control   logic      (PLC)     included.           There      are     also  additional           RTD,
thermocouple,        voltage       and     current         inputs       via  additional            CAN
bus  modules.     The     controller           20    has     the     native     ability         to be
remote     controlled             for       extra           flexibility            via        ModBus
communication protocol over RS232,                          rs485      and TCP/IP physical
layer,  where     it     can be       integrated           into     a   SCADA,      as    is    known
in the art.
[0071]      Based         on      Applicant's               experimental              data,        the
avoidable    frequencies            using       a   Volvo        TAD754GE       diesel        engine
and  LeroySomer        LSA    46.2L6        J6/4      alternator          are     below       28   Hz,
with   other    engine-alternators                    combinations           having          similar
limitations.         As     such,         the       controller           20      is      generally

                                                        21
programmed           to      control            the       operating            characteristics               to
operate         between          30      to        60Hz.        This       frequency          limitation
defines the          functional            frequency            range      of the      system 10          from
an     electrical           power         perspective.               Also,        it    restricts           the
induction         motor        16     coupled          pump       18    to    run     at    speeds        less
than       minimum         functional              speed       typically            imposed        by     pump
manufacturers.
 [0072]          Another         power        limitation            is    the     voltage       output       of
the     generator          14    which         is    precisely           controlled          to      deliver
the     desired      electrical            power         and protect            the    engine        14   from
stall,       in    the      event         of      load      being       more       than     the      maximum
deliverable             power        from         the       alternator             14.     This        closed
control loop            system is          one of the              two dynamically            controlled
parameter         used        by      the       controller             20.      The     controller           20
controls         the        engine         parameters               and      its      performance            by
continually            adjusting            the       rotational            speed       based        on     the
primary        control        parameter            of    the      headworks         30   (level,        flow,
pressure         or     frequency)             and      is     achieved,           depending          on    the
selected         engine,         by      adjusting            the      throttle         on    mechanical
engine       or    by      requesting             a   particular            speed      or    torque,         on
electronic         engines,           as    a    command        over      the     CANbus     to     the     ECU

 [0073]          An      important            feature         of     the      system       10,      being      a
clear       and   distinct           difference            between         conventional            variable
speed       or    soft        start        systems,           are       at    start-up.          When       the
system        10    is     required           to     start,         the     engine       12      generally
starts        with       the       load        36      connected           and       circuit         breaker
closed,        without         excitation             (starting);            after      the     system       10
is    started, it           runs for a period of time at a desired engine
idle      speed,       typically           between           750     to    900rpm,       for      a    warmup

                                                      22
 (idle          run);      after        the        idle     run      time,          the      alternator
excitation             is     engaged          and      output        voltage            is      increased
proportional             to    the      rotational         speed        of     the      load,      without
exceeding            the    maximum           power      delivered           by       the     engine      in
accordance            with     its      power       curve     and      without          exceeding       the
synchronous             alternator            overcurrent          level,           as     the     current
level.
 [0074]             The    induction           motor      16     coupled          to      the     pump    18
achieves           minimum         speed       typically         less       than       three       seconds
under           full      operational              load.      This         starting            phase      is
operationally             similar          to   conventional           soft       starter         systems,
with the exception that the                          delivered power               in the system 10
is      at      variable        speed        and     is    identical            with       an     external
variable            speed      drive         or     variable        frequency              drive      which
delivers            power       to      the      load      at     variable             frequency        and
voltage, with the exception the power                                 system is            not    affected
by the harmonics generated by Soft Starter                                       or VSD,         resulting
into         a    much      smoother            operation,         reduces             copper       loses,
reduces           cable     temperature;              as   the     power          supplied         to   the
induction motor is                  a pure        sine-ware without                any     distortions.
The       final      speed      is     then      determined        by     the       functional         mode
selected.
 [0075]             From    a    process         perspective,            the      pump      temperature
is     monitored and if               above a typical 6 0 'C,                 the      system 10 will
initiate           a  warning         and     above      70'C     will       initiate          an   alarm.
The      difference         between         warning       and alarm          is     that     the    system
10 will          signal     a warning if a parameter is                          outside of normal
operation            value     but      the     system      will       continue           to     function;
and      an     alarm is      a    situation         where     the      system 10           will    signal
an       outside        warning         limit        value      and      will         shut       down   the

system.          As     designed,           there        are      two      types      of      alarm        use       in
system         10:      one     which          will      trip       the       system       e.g.        low      bore
level,          electrical             faults,           pump        temperature              and        critical
mechanical             faults;         and       process         alarms         which       will       not      trip
the      system          10    but       will       inhibit          operation           e.g.        stop       bore
level,         low      flow,       high        flow,       pump        low     pressure,            pump       high

 [0083]           Applicant          believes            it   particularly              advantageous
that      the     system      10     carries         multiple      distinctive            advantages
over     conventional           variable          speed     drive     (VSD)       or soft     starter
 (SS)      system,        by   eliminating              the    harmonics          induced      by     the
VSD,      less      copper     losses         due     to    harmonics,          less     operational

print,         decreased         weight,           increased        reliability             and     fuel
efficiency.           Oversizing           is    eliminated       in     comparison          with     the
traditional systems                as the pumping system at full                          load is      at
75%      of      the      maximum        power         level     provided            by   the     power
generator.           This    load      level        coincides       with      the      maximum      fuel
efficiency of the engine.
 [0084]           As     the system 10            is    revolving at         reduced speed the
mechanical           wear      is     also        reduced,       via      reduced         vibration,
reduces           friction          and         reduces         rotational              speed.        The
controller 10             is  reduced to            a single box with latest                  control

consequently              longer       asset        operation.              Capital          investment         is
reduced         to    60     -  70% of the           traditional              system and             operation
cost       is    reduced         with      7-15% based                 on    the      fuel       consumption
