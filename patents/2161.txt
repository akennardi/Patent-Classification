   Experimental Details
   Methods
   Glatiramer Acetate (GA) Injection 40mg/mL in a prefilled syringe (GA
   injection 40mg/mL in            PFS or Copaxone*       40mg/mL)      was developed      as a
30 new formulation of the active ingredient                     glatiramer acetate,      which
   is also used in the marketed product Copaxone* 20mg/mL solution for
   injection      in    a   prefilled       syringe.    Copaxone*       40mg/mL    is   to    be
   administered        three      times   a    week   by      subcutaneous     injection      to

                                           18
   patients   with    Relapsing     Remitting    Multiple    Sclerosis.   The   new
   formulation   is   based on the     formulation of the marketed Copaxone*
   20mg/mL   solution    for   injection   in  a  prefilled    syringe.  Copaxone*
   20mg/mL is an approved product, the safety and efficacy of which are
 5 supported by over two decades of clinical research and over a decade
   of   post-marketing      experience.    The   only   difference    between   the
   formulations    is   the   double  amount   of   the   active  substance   used,
   which   results    in   a   solution   with   double    the   concentration   of
   glatiramer acetate      (40mg/mL vs.   20mg/mL).    The amount of mannitol in
10 both Copaxonee formulations remains unchanged (40mg/mL).
   The   compositions    of   CopaxoneO   20mg/mL    and   Copaxone*  40mg/mL   are
   detailed in Table 1.

    1. Calculated on the dry basis and 100% assay
    Studies were conducted in           order to verify that the formulation of
    CopaxoneO     40mg/mL,      its       manufacturing      process     and      chemical,
  5 biological     and    microbiological        attributes      are    appropriate       for
    commercialization.       Studies       were   also    conducted     to   confirm      the
    suitability of the proposed container closure system for packaging
    Copaxone* 40mg/mL.
    Mannitol   was     chosen    as     the   tonicity     agent    for    the    initially
10  formulated Copaxone*O      (freeze dried product,          reconstituted prior to
    administration) as it        is  also a bulking agent.          When the currently
    marketed ready-to-use formulation of CopaxoneO 20mg/mL solution for
    injection prefilled syringe was developed, mannitol was used in this
    formulation as well,        as the osmoregulator.          Finally,     when the new
15  40mg/mL formulation was developed,               based on the Copaxone*         20mg/mL
    formulation, mannitol remained as the osmoregulator.
    Mannitol   is    widely   used     in   parenteral     formulations      as   an    osmo
    regulator.    It   is  freely     soluble     in   water   and stable      in   aqueous
    solutions.    Mannitol    solutions may be sterilized by filtration,                   In
20  solution,   mannitol is       not     affected    by atmospheric      oxygen     in   the
    absence of catalysts. The concentration of mannitol in the Copaxone*
    40mg/mL   is     40mg/mL.    Maintaining       the    mannitol    concentration        in
    Copaxonem 40mg/mL resulted in an essentially isotonic solution.
    Water for injection (WFI)         is   the most widely used solvent and inert
25  vehicle in    parenteral     formulations.        Water is   chemically      stable in

                                                   20
   all physical states.          It    is  the base for many biological                    life     forms,
   and its safety in pharmaceutical formulations is unquestioned.
   Example 1
   The manufacturing process of Copaxone                    40mg/mL comprises:
 5        * Compounding a bulk solution of GA and mannitol in                                  water for
          injections (WFI).
          * Sterilizing         filtration        of   the     bulk       solution       yielding        the
          sterile GA solution in bulk.
          a  Aseptic       filling        of   sterile       bulk        solution       into      syringe
10        barrels and stoppering.
          * Inspection and final assembly of the filled syringes.
   Initially,    filtration of bulk solution from the compounding                                  vessel
   was performed through a               sequential     filter         train consisting            of two
   sequential      sterilizing            filters       (filters            named       Ai      and      A2 ,
15 respectively)      to a receiving vessel.                From the receiving vessel                      it
   was transferred        to the       intermediate       vessel in          the filling         machine
   and   further      through        dosing      pumps      and       needles       into       prefilled
   syringes.    However,      due to a        Health Authority request                   to place        the
   sterilizing    filter      as close as possible to the filling                           point,       the
20 second    sterilizing        filter       was   moved       between        the     receiving          and
   intermediate     vessels.        In    the   current       filtration        train,        the    first
   sterilizing    filter      was      named    Filter      A,     and     the   second        relocated
   sterilizing filter was named Filter B. See, Figure 1.
   In   line   with      the    process        for    the      approved        Copaxone*         20mg/mL
25 formulation,      all    processing         steps    of      the      new   Copaxonee         40mg/mL
   formulation       were       originally           conducted            at    controlled             room
   temperature.       However,         filtration       of        the      higher       concentration
   solution    resulted      in     a    pressure     build-up          on   the     second      filter,
   Filter   B.   Despite     the      observed     pressure          increase      on     Filter      B,     a
30 high-quality     drug product           could     be   obtained by           filtration          of     GA
   40mg/mL at controlled room temperature,                      as confirmed by release and

                                                  21
   stability      data.      Nevertheless,      an   improved    filtration        process      was
   needed which avoided the build-up on the second filter.
   Flow rate       for fluids can be defined by the differential                        pressure,
   and inversely moderated by viscosity. Viscosity, in turn, is usually
 5 reciprocal        in     relation     to    temperature       (Meltzer        and      Jornitz,

   Second      Edition,        CRC   Press,     2007,     page    166).       Increasing        the
   temperature        of   a    solution   will     normally   decrease        the     viscosity,
   thereby enhancing the flow rate.
10 In    an attempt to solve the pressure build-up problem on the second
   filter, the temperature condition of the filtration was raised above
   controlled room temperature.              Although the viscosity decreased,                  the
   filterability decreased, resulting in a failed attempt.
   The following studies were performed:
15          a  Filter Validation         Study:     Determination        of   ranges       for  the
            manufacturing        parameters    related to     sterilizing        Filter A       and
            sterilizing        Filter   B    of    the   bulk    solution,        as      well   as
            confirmation of filter compatibility with the drug product.
            * Filtration Process:         Selection of the sterilizing filtration
20          conditions best suitable for the manufacturing process and the
            quality of the drug product.
   Filters       Used      for      Copaxone*      20mg/mL     and       Copaxone*          40mg/mL
   Manufacturing
   The     manufacturing        process   of   Copaxone*     40mg/mL      was    based on       the
25 process used to produce the marketed Copaxone* 20mg/mL solution for
   injection      in   a  prefilled     syringe.     Therefore     the     same   filters      used
   for filtration of marketed product were used.
   Two sterilizing filters            were used,     each of which having a pore size
   of      0.2pm      or      less,    to     effectively       remove        microorganisms.
30 Sterilization         is    achieved    only     by   filtration       using      sterilizing
   filters      and    not     by  using    other    methods,     e.g.      sterilization        is
   achieved without using heat, chemicals, or radiation exposure.

   Filter        Validation Study           -      Confirmation and Setting of                 Parameters
   Associated with Filter Compatibility and with Sterilizing Filtration
   The following tests were performed in                          order to confirm            the filter
   validity:
 5 a   Extractables testing -                  assessment       of extractables        released        from
   the     filter       upon     steam     sterilization         and   their      removal         from  the
   filter by a model solvent, thus assessing the volume to be discarded
   after the filtration through the Filter B, prior to beginning of the
   aseptic filling.
10 a   Compatibility/adsorption testing -                         assessment       of    the       chemical
   compatibility of GA                20mg/mL and GA 40mg/mL solution with the filter
   material         and     the   extent       of    its    adsorption     to     the    filter,       thus
   assessing the volume to be discarded after                            the filtration through
   Filter       B,    prior     to beginning           of the    aseptic    filling       in      order to
15 provide assay within specifications.
   *   Residual         effect      -   To    ensure      that    no   significant         residual      GA
   20mg/mL         or   GA     40mg/mL     solution        that   might    affect      the       post   use
   integrity test remains on the filter after filtration.
   * Bacterial challenge - To ensure that the filtration process does
20 not affect the ability of the filter to provide a sterile solution.
   The    above       tests     were    conducted        using maximum pressure              (up to 5.0
   bar).     The validation study demonstrated that the selected filtration
   system is         capable of providing a high quality Copaxone* 20mg/mL and
   Copaxone* 40mg/mL.
25 Given        the     strict        and    well-defined          operational        and        equipment
   parameters of the GA 40mg/mL solution filtration process,                                   a plan to
   mitigate          the     potential        increase       in    pressure       by    reducing        the
   filtration temperature was developed.
   Without much expectations,                   it  was decided to examine            the filtration
30 process of GA 40mg/mL sterile bulk solution through Filter B under
   reduced          temperature         conditions,          using    the      same      filters        and

   filtration        train     as  for     the    filtration      at    controlled        room
   temperature.
   Accordingly,        experiments    were   performed     in    order    to   compare     the
   filtration       of   GA  40mg/mL    sterile    bulk  solution     through      Filter    B
 5 under      reduced    temperature    and   controlled     room   temperature       in   the
   production      environment     and   to ensure     that    there   is   no   difference
   with regard        to the quality and stability profiles of the filtered
   solutions.        In   all   experiments,      the   sterile     bulk     solution      was
   prepared according to the standard compounding and filtration                         train
10  (see Figure 1) and filtered through two filters: Filter A and Filter
   B.
   The     experiments     tested   two   different    cooling    technologies        (cooled
   receiving vessels vs heat exchanger) with cooled filter. The studies
   are schematically depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Further details
15 about these experiments and their outcomes are provided hereafter.
   Filtration Process - Experiment No.             1
   The objective of Experiment No.             1 was to compare       the filterability
   of a batch of bulk solution held and filtered through Filter B at
   either      controlled     room   temperature     or   under    reduced      temperature
20 conditions       (cooling by double-jacketed         receiving vessel and cooled
   Filter B housing).

   bulk solution             was completed.             Filtration was stopped
   filtered                                             due to increase in

          Bulk solution size: 230 liters.           Filtration of solution at
          controlled room temperature was stopped after 85 liters          have
 5       been pushed through the filter          due to increased pressure and
          the remaining solution was transferred to the cooled receiving

 5 Filtration Process - Experiment No. 2
   The     first      objective           of Experiment      No.    2 was      to    evaluate       whether
   local       cooling of GA 40mg/mL                 solution using a          Heat    Exchanger          (HE)
   could improve the filterability through cooled Filter B compared to
   filterability               of      the    same    bulk    solution        at     controlled          room
10 temperature.
   The second objective of Experiment No.                         2 was to confirm that there
   is    no     difference           in   the quality of        the drug product            filled into
   syringes at controlled room temperature and drug product filled into
   syringes at reduced temperature.
15 Cooling by heat                 exchanger      was   evaluated     as   it    seemed      to be       much
   easier        to steam sterilize              than using the double jacketed receiving
   vessels. The HE was located between the receiving vessel and Filter
   B.     Consequently,              as    opposed    to   Experiment      No.     1    (in   which        the
   solution          was       cooled       by    the    double-jacketed          receiving         vessels

   filtration          through         Filter B) ,     the solution      in     this    experiment was
   held       at    controlled           room    temperature     prior     to     filtration        of     the
   locally cooled (by HE) GA solution through Filter B.

   Filtration Process - Experiment No. 3
   One objective of Experiment No. 3 was to confirm whether cooling of
   GA 40mg/mL bulk     solution prior to filtration,          using HE and cooled
 5 filter  housing,    allows  filtration     and filling     of  batches   of     130L
   size within various manufacturing regimens.
   Another objective of Experiment No.         3 was to evaluate the influence
   of holding time     at various stages of         the manufacturing process        on
   filterability of GA 40mg/mL.
10 Another   objective    of Experiment     3 was     to demonstrate   with   a    high
   degree of assurance that locally cooled GA 40mg/mL solution filtered
   through   Filter B is     not    different    in    its quality   and  stability
   profile   from   GA   40mg/mL    solution    filtered    through   Filter     B   at
   controlled room temperature conditions with regard to pre-determined
15 parameters and limits.
   A series of three batches of bulk solution, manufactured at various
   regimens,   were  prepared.     Each   bulk solution was      prepared   from     an

   results in     lower pressure during the filtration step of both Filter
20 A  and   Filter      B     as    compared     to   passing        the    same    bulk    solution
   filtered under controlled room temperature.

   cooled    Filter        A      and    Filter     B    in      sequence      (see      Figure    9)
   significantly       reduces         impairment     of    filterability          caused     by  the
25 total duration of the process (holding time) as well as by filtering
   larger volume,        compared to the same bulk solution                         filtered under

   Figure   10)   results in          lower pressure during the filtration                   step of
   both Filter A and Filter B as compared to the holding the same bulk

   Cooling of GA 40mg/mL bulk solution below 17.50C in                                      the receiving
   vessel before            passing     through Filter B (see Figure                      11)   results   in
   lower pressure during the filtration step of Filter B as compared to

   filterability           caused by the total duration of the process                             (holding
20 time)       as well as by filtering larger volume,                          compared       to the same

   Discussion of Examples 1-9
   Reducing          the     temperature        of     GA     40mg/mL       sterile       bulk    solution
   significantly            improved      its    filterability,            as   demonstrated         by the
25 much lower increase               in   pressure on Filter B during filtration                        and
   filling and by the               larger volume that               can be filtered           at   reduced
   temperature. Pressure increases were observed when the sterile bulk
   solution was held and filtered at controlled room temperature, while
   there was no significant increase in the pressure when the solution
30 was filtered under reduced temperature conditions.
   The     holding       time    of    the    bulk      solution        during    filtration        through
   Filter        B   negatively        affects       the     filterability          of     the   solution.
   However,        the total      duration of the process                   (holding time)        impaired

                                                      32
   the filterability          significantly           less when filtration         was performed
   under    reduced temperature             conditions.         Consequently,     longer holding
   time can be used with reduced temperature filtration.
   Both cooling of the solution by passing it through a heat exchanger
 5  (local cooling)       and/or        cooling of the whole bulk               (e.g. by double
   jacketed receiving vessel)                before     filtration through cooled Filters
   A or B or A and B were found to be suitable solutions for reduced
   temperature filtration.
   Accumulated       stability        data    indicate        that  there    is   no  substantial
10 difference with regard to quality and stability profile between the
   solution       filtered      under       reduced       temperature     conditions     and    the
   solution filtered at controlled room temperature.
   In    sum,   the    performed         experiments         show  that    reduced    temperature
   filtration through Filter B significantly improved the filterability
15 of GA 40mg/mL solution compared to the filterability of the solution
   when filtered at controlled room temperature. Moreover, reducing the
   temperature       of  the      bulk solution          during    the   compounding     stage   or
   before     passing     through        Filter     A,     or reducing      the   temperature    of
   Filter A       also   improves         the   filterability        of   GA    40mg/mL  solution
20 compared      to the     filterability           of    the   solution    at   controlled    room
   temperature.
   Consequently,        the     proposed       manufacturing         process      for  commercial
   batches     of    GA   20mg/mL         and   GA     40mg/mL     includes      cooling   of   the
   solution prior to filtration of the bulk solution through Filter B.

    Container Closure System
   The container closure systems selected for the Copaxone* 40mg/mL are
    the same as those used for the marketed product                            Copaxone*   20mg/mL
    PFS.   The    container       closure      system        consists   of a     colorless    glass
30 barrel, a plastic plunger rod and a grey rubber stopper.
    Long Term and Accelerated Stability Studies

                                            33
   Satisfactory    stability    data   after    up   to    36     months    storage      under
   long-term storage conditions        (5*C t 30C)       and after 6 months storage
   under accelerated     conditions     (25*   t  20C/60        5% RH)    are available.
   The data demonstrate that the proposed container closure systems are
 5 suitable for protection and maintenance of the drug product quality
   throughout its proposed shelf-life.
   Protection from Light
   Marketed CopaxoneO      should be stored protected from light.                   Based on
   this   recommendation,      it  is   proposed       that      Copaxone*      40mg/mL     be
10 similarly packed in       PVC transparent      blisters inside a            carton box,
   which    provides   light    protection.      The      light     protection        of   the
   proposed    packaging      when    used    for     the       CopaxoneO      40mg/mL      is
   recommended     in   accordance      with    the      results      obtained        from    a
   photostability       study      comparing         the         following        packaging
15 configurations:
   1.    Glass barrel syringe and plunger rod (Primary package);
         Glass barrel     syringe and plunger rod in              a transparent blister
          (partial secondary package);
         Glass barrel     syringe and plunger rod in              a transparent blister
20       inside carton box (complete intended packaging configuration).
   As a reference, the following configurations were added:
   2.    Glass barrel syringe and plunger rod wrapped in aluminum foil;
         Glass barrel and plunger rod in           a    transparent blister wrapped
         in aluminum foil.
25 All packages were simultaneously exposed to standardized sunlight (5
   KLUX) for 10 days and to near UV light for additional 5 days.
   All  the obtained results       from the photostability              study    are within
   the  specifications.      However,    the   impurity peak          detected     is    lower
   when    the   drug   product     is    packed     in     its     complete      packaging
30 configuration.      The     carton     box    was       shown       to    improve       the
   photostability     and    gives   light    protection         as   good    as    that    of

                                                  34
   aluminum foil,        which is    regarded as a complete light protector.                  The
   intended       packaging    configuration        is    therefore      considered     suitable
   for its use.
   A    storage     statement     to   protect     the     product      from    light   exposure
 5 should be added to the product label.
   Microbiological Attributes
   The medicinal product is            a sterile,        single dose,       parenteral    dosage
   form. Sterilization is achieved by sterile filtration.
   A microbial        limits   test    is    performed for        the drug       substance.   The
10 sterility       and  bacterial     endotoxins        are monitored upon          release   and
   throughout         stability      studies        of      the     drug      product,      using
   pharmacopoeia        methods.    The     limits     applied     are    identical    to   those
   applied for the marketed Copaxonee.
   The      same   container     closure      systems      are    used     for   the   Copaxone*
15 20mg/mL       and    Copaxone*     40mg/mL.        The     integrity      testing     studies
   performed       to   demonstrate       the   efficacy       of   the     container    closure
   systems on use for the marketed product are also considered relevant
   for Copaxone* 40mg/mL.
