                                           VENETIAN BLIND
          The disclosure                relates       to     a venetian          blind,       and more
   particularly               to    a venetian            blind       with adjustable                slat
 5 angle.
          Referring          to    Figure 1,         a conventional               venetian         blind
   1,   as disclosed             in   Taiwanese Utility                  Patent        No. M306267,
   includes          a frame 11,              a plurality            of slats          12 rotatably
   connected to             the frame 11,             a plurality            of rotary         members
10 13 each connected fixedly                          to     an end of a respective                    one
   of the slats              12,     a bead chain 14 trained                        on the rotary
   members 13,            and an operating                  member 15 connected to                     the
   bead chain 14 and movable relative                                 to   the frame 11.             When
   the operating member                         15   is     moved upward or                   downward
15 relative         to    the frame 11,            the operating              member 15 drives
   rotation         of the bead chain 14 so as to                           rotate        the    rotary
   members 13.            The slats           12 rotate         together         with the rotary
   members 13             so     that the          slat       angle is          adjusted.
          However,         each of the slats                 12 has an angle of rotation
20 less      than 90 degrees,                   which means that                  the     bead chain
   14 has to           drive        the rotation              of the rotary               members 13
   by     moving           a     relatively              short        distance,             which         is
   relatively difficult to operate and may be laborious
   for an operator.
25        Therefore,            an object         of the disclosure                   is  to   provide
   a venetian          blind       that      can alleviate            at   least        the drawback
   of the prior art.

       The belt  42 is   made from a magnetically conductive
   material. The belt    42 is connected to the constant-force
   coil springs 43, and cooperates with the constant-force
   coil springs 43 to forma loop trainedon the transmission
20 rollers 41.   Specifically, the belt 42 has a hook end
   422 engaging the hook-engaging portion 433 of one of
   opposite endmost ones of the constant-force coil springs
   43, and a hook-engaging end 421 opposite to the hook
   end 422 and engaging the hook end portion 432 of the
25 other   one  of    the    opposite   endmost     ones    of  the
   constant-force    coil springs 43 so as to form the loop.

   the operating             piece 521 has a rail-engaging                        portion         5211
   that      slidably        engages the            slide       rail    214 so as to          permit
   the       operating            piece        521      to     be      slidable.           In     this
   embodiment,           the     outer      controlmember 52 further                      includes
 5 two outer magnetic elements 522 and two rollers 523.
   The     outer magnetic                 elements           522     are    disposed in the
   operating             piece          521,       and         are      magnetically                and
   respectively             attracted           to    the inner          magnetic elements
   512     for providing a magnetic force                                so that the slide
10 movement           of   the      outer        control          member       52    drives         the
   movement of the inner control member                                      51.    The     rollers
   523 are          disposed in the operating piece                               521,      and are
   in    rolling        contact          with the outer               surface       2111 of the
   one     of the side             frames         21.
15        Referring         to    Figures 5 to           7,   the outer        control        member
   52 is movable relative to the frame unit 2 between a
   first       position         (see Figure 5)              and a second position                  (see
   Figure 6).           When the outer control member 52                                  is moved
   from the           first position               to the           second position, the
20 constant-force                 coil       springs          43     are     wound       to     drive
   movement of the belt                      42 and to drive rotation of the
   drive        axles      31     in the        first        rotational          direction to
   rotate        the slats          32,     so that         the slats         32 are open and
   each         of     the      slats         32     is       substantially               disposed
25 horizontally             when the outer               control        member 52 is           at   the
   second position.
          When the outer               control        member         52 is     moved from the

                                                       9
   second            position             to        the         first         position,               the
   constant-force                 coil       springs         43    are     unwound to              drive
   rotation          of the drive              axles      31 in        a second rotational
   direction which                  is    opposite to               the     first      rotational
 5 direction            to  reversely           rotate       the slats         32,     so that        the
   slats         32      are     closed         and     each         of    the     slats          32    is
   substantially                 disposed            vertically              when       the        outer
   control member 52                    is at the first position. When the
   outer        control       member 52 slides                   and stops        at     one of the
10 first       and secondpositions                    or at     any point        therebetween,
   orientation              of the       slats       32    (i.e.,        the slat          angle)       is
   maintained due to                 characteristic                 of the constant-force
   coil       springs         43.
           It  should be noted that                  when the outer             control         member
15 52 is       moved between the first                         position        and the          second
   position,            an angle of rotation                     of each of the             slats       32
   is      less than 95             degrees.
           Referring to Figure 8,                      a second embodiment of the
   venetian          blind       according to             the disclosure                is    similar
20 to    the   first       embodiment.           The difference              between the first
   and second embodiments resides in that the operating
   piece        521      of the       second embodiment                    has    a    corrugated
   surface          5212,     and that         the venetian             blind     of the second
   embodiment further                   includes         a drive        unit     6 disposed for
25 electrically              driving         the movement of the outer                        control
   member 52.           The driveunit             6includesathreadedrodmember
   61 that        engages the           corrugated            surface        5212 of the outer

                                                       10
   control         member          52,     and a motor 62 that                    is   disposed on
   the frame unit                 2 for       driving         rotation          of the threaded
   rod member             61,     thereby         resulting           in    slide      movement of
   the operating               piece        521.     In   this       embodiment,          the motor
 5 62 is      disposed on the outer                        surface         2111 of the          one of
   the side            frames         21.
          In summary, the venetian blind of this disclosure
   is    simple in          structure           and is      easy to        operate.       By virtue
   of the configuration of the transmission unit 4,                                                 the
10 drive        axles        31     can be        driven to            rotate         in the      first
   rotationaldirection                       or the second rotational                    direction
   to     adjust         the angle of the                   slats        32    in a     smooth and
   effort-saving                manner.          The orientation                 of the slats        32
   is   maintained when the outer                           control        member 52 is          moved
15 to    one of the first                 and second positions                    or to   any point
   therebetween.
           In     the       description               above,         for      the      purposes      of
   explanation, numerous                          specific details have been set
   forth       in    order to           provide a thorough understanding                             of
20 the embodiments.                    It   will      be apparent,              however,        to  one
   skilled         in    the     art,      that      one or more other                 embodiments
