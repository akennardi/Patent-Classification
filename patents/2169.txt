provided with a positioning pin 1222 and a second spring 1223 for limiting the
rotation of the corresponding rear leg 122, one end of the second spring 1223 is
connected with the positioning pin, and the other end of the second spring 1223 is
connected with the connection rod 10. In this structure, when the front leg 121 is
unfolded, the groove 41 of the bottom board 4 is clamped on the second supporting
                                            13

shaft 8, under the action of pushing via the bottom board 4, the guide rod 20 of the
rear leg 122 is hooked and fixed to the hook 18, and the front legs 121 and the rear
legs 122 are firmly fixed, in this way, the second spring 1223 is in a slightly
stretched state. When the bracket 1 needs to be folded, the second supporting shaft
8 is detached from the groove 41 of the bottom board 4, the bottom board 4 is
moved on the second supporting shaft 8, and the keystroke 17 is pressed
simultaneously, so that the hook 18 is detached from the guide rod 20, and driving
the connection rod 10 to rotate in the arcuate positioning hole 1221 that is under the
action of the weight of the collapsible barbeque grill and the second spring 1223,
therefore the connection shaft 15 drives the rear leg 122 to rotate counterclockwise
to fold, and rotates the front leg 121counterclockwiselyvia the external force and
first spring 1213 to fix the hanging hook 32 and the latching pillar 14, so that the
front leg 121to be folded, at this time, the bracket 1 is folded. So that the rear leg
122 can be quickly unfolded without external force or small external force, the
unfolding efficiency of the rear leg 122 can be improved, thereby saving time and
labor.
     At the bottom of the table 6 is installed with a supporting table 63. The
supporting table 63 is rotation arranged on the table 6. In this structure, the
supporting table 63 can be rotated out of the table 6, or can be rotated to be hidden
inside the table 6, therefore, the supporting table 63 can be folded in a simple
manner; and the supporting table 63 can hold seasonings, ingredients, barbeque
tools and other items, which can improve the function of the collapsible barbeque
grill, and the collapsible barbeque grill is easy to operate and use. In other
embodiments, the supporting table 63 may also be disposed at other positions,
which is not limited herein.
