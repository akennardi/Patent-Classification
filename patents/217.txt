   FIELD
   [0002]       The present invention relates to home use carbonation machines, e.g., including
   clamping apparatuses for attaching bottles to the machines.
15 BACKGROUND
   [0003]        Soda machines for the carbonation of beverages are known in the art. Most such
   devices for home carbonation are designed for manual operation; typically comprising a
   manually operated gas release valve to release CO 2 into a closed bottle of water from an
   attached pressurized cylinder. Such machines typically also comprise one or more safety
20 pressure release valves which are designed to vent if excess pressure builds up during the
   carbonization process.
   [004]        For example, U.S. Patent 7,975,988, hereby incorporated in its entirety by
   reference, discloses a carbonation assembly with two pressure release valves. The first
   valve is designed to vent with an audible sound at a level of pressure consistent with the
25 maximum processing pressure. The second release valve is designed to vent at a higher
   level of pressure as a safety measure in case the first valve malfunctions and/or for
   whatever reason CO 2 continues to flow into the bottle uncontrolled and the pressure rises
   past the recommended level for safe operation.
   [0005]       It is desired to address or ameliorate one or more disadvantages or limitations
30 associated with the prior art, or to at least provide a useful alternative.

   SUMMARY
   [0006]       In accordance with the present invention there is provided a home use carbonation
   machine comprising:
 5              a carbonation assembly to carbonate liquid in a bottle with pressurized gas from a
   canister;
                an electrical controller to operate said carbonation assembly to lower a lever to
   release the pressurized gas from the canister;
                 at least one normally open safety valve to vent the bottle when the carbonation
10 machine is not actively carbonating; and
                a charge storage device configured to store an electrical charge when the
   carbonation machine is in operation, and to provide sufficient electrical power in the event
   of a power outage to enable the controller to raise the lever from the canister and to open
   said at least one normally open safety valve.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
15 [0019]        Described herein is a pronged clamp apparatus for attaching a soda bottle to a
   soda machine, the apparatus comprising prongs to attach the bottle to the soda machine;
   and a locking mechanism to lock the bottle to the machine at least during carbonation.
   [0020]        The apparatus also comprises a flexible seal to facilitate a closed carbonation
   environment and a ring to constrict the prongs underneath a ringed extension of the bottle
20 thereby lifting the bottle towards the seal to clamp the bottle to the flexible seal.
   [0021]        The locking mechanism is a mechanical stop.
   [0022]        The mechanical stop is a recessed area in a cam of the soda machine, the recessed
   area receiving an activator pin connected to the pronged clamp during the carbonation.
   [0023]        The mechanical stop is a rib of a lever which stops an extension of the pronged
25 clamp from tilting during the carbonation.
   [0024]        The ringed extension is around a spout of the bottle.
   [0025]        The ringed extension is near threads around the spout.
   [0026]        The apparatus also comprises a constricting ring with centering ribs to guide the
   bottle into the pronged clamp during insertion and to constrict the prongs during operation.
30 [0027]        Described herein is a pronged clamp to fit a bottle to a flexible seal, thereby
   facilitating a closed carbonation environment in the bottle; and a normally open safety

         R~dl~ltewovn\R~otbiDC\DX~l49068Ldocx-20/02/208
                                                        -4
   valve to vent the bottle when the machine is not actively carbonating.
   [0028]       The normally open safety valve comprises a spring normally pushing a pin away
   from a carbonation path of the machine.
   [0029]       The home use carbonation machine also comprises a cam to push the pin against
 5 the spring to close the path during carbonation.
   [0030]       Described herein is a home use carbonation machine comprising a carbonation
   assembly to carbonate liquid with pressurized gas; a pronged clamp to attach a bottle
   containing the liquid to the machine; and a centering ring with centering ribs to guide the
   bottle into the pronged clamp during insertion and to constrict prongs of the clamp during
10 operation.
   [0031]       In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in
   order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be understood
   by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific
   details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, and components have not
15 been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.
   [0032]       It will be appreciated that the standard water bottles that may be used with prior
   art machines may typically have threaded spouts designed to facilitate screwing on a bottle
   cap. In the prior art, the bottles may typically be attached to a home soda machine by
   rotating the bottle several times to "screw in" the threaded spout to a mount on the
20 machine. Applicants have realized that, while this may seem secure, it is an awkward way
   to mount the bottle.
   [0033]       In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a water
   bottle may be attached to a soda machine via a simple "position and press" process,
   without requiring any rotational motions, using a flower-like, pronged clamp.
25 [0034]       Reference is now made to Fig. IA which illustrates a carbonation head assembly
    130 in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Assembly 130
   may comprise carbonating heads lower 135, exhaust valve 210, safety valve 220,
   carbonation injector 230, bottle insertion lever 240 and pronged clamp 250. Pronged clamp
   250 may comprise flexible prongs 255 which may be attachable to a bottle. Exhaust valve
30 210 and safety valve 220 may function in generally the same manner as in the prior art. For
   example, exhaust valve 210 may be configured to vent at 8 bars of pressure to indicate that

         R~dl~ltewovn\R~otbiDC\DX~l49068Ldocx-20/02/208
                                                        -5
   the carbonation in a bottle may have reached recommended levels; safety valve 220 may
   be configured to vent at 11 bars of pressure.
   [0035]       As illustrated in Fig. lB to which reference is also made, in operation, a user may
   insert a water bottle 170 by first positioning it at an angle such that injector 230 extends
 5 into bottle 170 while bottle 170 comes in contact with the center of pronged clamp 250 on
   the underside of carbonating head lower 135. As will be disclosed hereinbelow, once bottle
   170 is in position it may be locked into place by pressing it against bottle insertion lever
   240 which in turn may cause pronged clamp 250 to clamp on bottle 170 and generally seal
   its opening.
10 [0036] Reference is now also made to Figs. IC and ID which illustrate alternative cross
   sectional views of assembly 130 without bottle 170 in order to afford a fuller view of the
   elements of assembly 130 that effect its attachment. As illustrated in both Figs. IC-1D,
   assembly 130 may also comprise pivot rod 260. Pivot rod 260 may extend between pivot
   points 265 on assembly 130. Pivot point 265A may be attached to the chassis of assembly
15 130 and may generally remain in the same position when lever 240 is pushed inwards by
   bottle 170. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that upon insertion of bottle 170, the
   attitude of pivot rod 260 may change as per the movement of pivot point 265B in the
   general direction of lever 240.
   [0037]       Assembly 130 may also comprise constricting ring 268. Constricting ring 268
20 may be generally square in shape with a hollow center, and may generally be positioned in
   parallel to carbonating head lower 135. As shown in Figs. lB and IC, in an "open" state,
   when inserting bottle 170, constricting ring 268 may be positioned just underneath
   platform 135, thus encompassing the upper portions of prongs 255. It will be appreciated
   that although Figs IC and ID may represent cross sectional views, ring 268 may generally
25 constitute a ring around prongs 255 and the mouth of bottle 170.
   [0038]       As discussed hereinabove, it will be appreciated that since pivot point 265B may
   be attached to ring 268, it may move in generally the same direction as insertion lever 240.
   Accordingly, when bottle 170 may be pressed against lever 240 in the direction of Arrow
   A (Fig. IC) by a user, the differential between pivot points 265A and 265B may lower ring
30 268, thereby constricting pronged clamp 250 to hold bottle 170 in place underneath
   platform 135.

         R~dl~ltewovn\R~otbiDC\DX~l49068Ldocx-20/02/208
                                                        -6
   [0039]       It will be appreciated that lever 240 may be positioned to allow bottle 170 to
   snugly fit against it when inserted into pronged clamp 250. This may reduce slippage
   during the insertion process of bottle 170 and may therefore prevent incidental breakage of
   parts of assembly 130. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present
 5 invention, lever 240 may be positioned such that a space of no more than 0.5 mm may
   exist between lever 240 and bottle 170 when bottle 170 is properly positioned in clamp
   250.
   [0040]       The clamping process may be understood by comparing Figs IC and ID. In Fig.
    IC, pivot rod 260 may be positioned at an angle and ring 268 may be positioned adjacent
10 to carbonating head lower 135. In Fig. ID, pivot rod 260 may be generally vertical and
   there may be distance between ring 268 and carbonating head lower 135. As pivot rod 260
   may move in the direction of Arrow A to a vertical position as in Fig. 3C, ring 268 may
   move away from carbonating head lower 135, thus constricting prongs 255. It will be
   appreciated flexible prongs 255 may comprise relatively thicker end elements to catch
15 below a screw top of bottle 170 to facilitate the clamping process as ring 268 may be
   lowered.
   [0041]       It will be appreciated that the opening of a typical bottle 170 may be large enough
   that a prong 255 might accidentally fit inside when a user inserts bottle 170. In accordance
   with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, centering ring 269 may extend from
20 underneath constricting ring 268. Centering ring 269 may comprise centering ribs 258
   which may be positioned to guide bottle 170 into the center area of pronged clamp 250.
   Centering ribs 258 may be generally located behind the gaps between individual prongs
   255 to prevent bottle 170 from "snagging" on a prong 255 as it may be inserted.
   [0042]       Reference is now made to Fig. 1E which illustrates a cross sectional view of a
25 bottle 170 as held by pronged clamp 250. Prong 255A may represent the position of one of
   prongs 255 when pronged clamp 250 may be engaged; conversely, prong 255B may
   represent the position of the same prong 255 when clamp 250 is not engaged. Bottle 170
   may comprise bottle ring 171, threads 172 and bottle lip 173. Bottle ring 171 may
   represent a ring extending around the spout of a typical plastic bottle. Seal 259 may
30 represent a flexible material positioned around the opening of bottle 170.

         R~dl~ltewovn\R~otbiDC\DX~l49068Ldocx-20/02/208
                                                        -7
   [0043]       As illustrated in Fig. 1E, when pronged clamp 250 is engaged, it may exert a force
   upwards from underneath bottle ring 171, thereby causing bottle lip 173 to extend into seal
   259. It will be appreciated that seal 259 may be configured to allow access to the contents
   of bottle 170 from assembly 130 for the purposes of carbonation and subsequent venting of
 5 pressurized CO-. Accordingly, when constricted by constricting ring 268, pronged clamp
   250 may clamp and seal the opening of bottle 170 against seal 259 such that bottle 170
   may only be vented via assembly 130. As discussed hereinabove, prior art versions of
   assembly 130 may typically have two release valves, each configured to open under
   different circumstances. For example, exhaust valve 210 (Fig. IA) may be configured to
10 vent when the pressure build up inside bottle 170 indicates that the carbonation pressure
   (typically 8 bars) has been reached. Safety valve 220 may be configured to vent as a safety
   measure when the pressure inside bottle 170 exceeds recommended levels, for example, 11
   bars of pressure.
   [0044]       Applicants have realized that additional safety measures may be required to
15 prevent the buildup of excess pressure during an automated process. In accordance with a
   preferred embodiment of the present invention, a soda machine having pronged clamp 250
   may also comprise a normally open double action safety valve 270. Reference is now made
   to Fig. 2A which illustrates an exemplary double action safety valve 270 in a normal open
   state. As is discussed in detail hereinbelow, the fact that double action safety valve 270
20 may be open in its normal state (as opposed to valves 210 and 220 which may normally be
   closed) may provide an additional level of safety for the operation of the soda machine.
   The soda machine may be configured to close safety valve 270 as part of the carbonation
   process, and to re-open it when the process finishes.
   [0045]       Double action safety valve 270 may comprise contact pin 275, poppet 410,
25 aperture 425, conduit 420 and springs 430 and 440. In its normal open state, as shown in
   Fig. 2A, the tension of spring 430 may serve to prevent poppet 410 from closing aperture
   420. However, when, as described hereinabove, contact pin 275 may be depressed during
   carbonation, such as by a cam defining the carbonation process, described in more detail
   hereinbelow, it may be pushed into valve 270, thereby exerting sufficient force on spring
30 430 to allow poppet 410 to slide into position to close aperture 425. It will be appreciated
   that conduit 420 may represent tubing (not shown) that may connect with carbonation head

          R~dl~ltewovn\R~otbiDC\DX~l49068Ldocx-20/02/208
   assembly 130. Accordingly, since valve 270 may be normally open even when connected
   to a bottle 170, it may provide an additional safeguard to the operation of machine 100 by
   ensuring that the contents of an attached bottle 170 may always be vented unless the
   carbonation process is expressly active at the time.
 5 [0046]        Upon completion of the carbonation process, contact pin 275 may no longer be
   depressed. Accordingly, at that point, contact pin 275 may no longer exert sufficient force
   on spring 430 to prevent it from moving poppet 410 to open aperture 420, thus returning
   safety valve 270 to its normally open state.
   [0047]        In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, safety valve
10 270 may be further configured to open during the carbonation process itself if for whatever
   reason the pressure in bottle 170 may exceed a pre-determined limit. For example, spring
   440 may be configured such that if the pressure inside bottle 170 exceeds 11 bars of
   pressure, poppet 410 may be moved backwards to open aperture 425, thusly venting bottle
    170. It will be appreciated that 11 bars of pressure may be sufficient to move poppet 410
15 even if contact pin 275 is depressed by a cam. It will further be appreciated that the
   configuration disclosed hereinabove may be exemplary; the present invention may include
   other suitable configurations as may be required for specific implementations.
   [0048]        Reference is now made to Fig. 2B which illustrated an alternative embodiment of
   double action safety valve 270, known from herein as double action safety valve 270'.
20 Double action safety valve 270' may comprise contact pin 275', poppet 410', aperture
   425', conduit 420' and spring 415. In normal operative mode as described hereinabove,
   during carbonation, pin 275' may exert pressure on spring 415 which may push poppet
   410' in order to close aperture 425'. It will be appreciated that spring 415 may be also set
   to a pre-determined pressure so that when aperture 425' is closed and when the buildup of
25 pressure inside bottle 170 exceeds pre-determined limits (typically 11 bars), spring 415
   may release poppet 410' and therefore re-open aperture 425' to allow for venting of excess
   gas.
   [0049]        Applicant has realized that the pronged clamp of the present invention may be
   utilized in a manually operated soda machine or in an automated soda machine.
30 [0050]        It will be appreciated that in order to provide automated operation, a home soda
   machine must comprise means for receiving electrical input via, for example, a connection

                                                  -9
   with the mains or a battery. Understandably, the introduction of electricity into any
   machine is not without risk. Accordingly, as opposed to a manually operated home soda
   machine, an automated version may require built-in safeguards to prevent damage from
   electricity. However, it will also be appreciated that in addition to the exposure to direct
 5 damage caused by electricity, adding an electrical component to the carbonation process
   may also indirectly add to the risks of using pressurized CO 2 . If, for whatever reason, there
   is a power interruption while the CO2 canister is open, there may be considerable exposure
   to explosion from continuing the carbonation process past safe levels of pressure. For
   example, in the prior art system disclosed in EP 1351758, if the power is cut while the cam
10 assembly is in position to mechanically open the CO2 canister, excess pressure may build
   up in the soda machine with undesirable results.
   [0051]    Accordingly, Applicant has realized that an automated home soda machine may
   require one or more additional safeguards to ensure that the supply of pressurized CO 2 may
   be terminated in the event of an electrical outage during operation. Reference is now made
15 to Figs. 3A and 3B which illustrate two states of a novel, semi-automated home soda
   machine 100, designed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the
   present invention. Fig. 3A illustrates a machine 100 with an attached water bottle 170;
   whereas Fig. 3B illustrates machine 100 at a point during the process of attaching bottle
    170. Semi-automated home soda machine 100 may comprise carbonation head assembly
20  130, CO2 canister 140, and carbonation gear assembly 150. Carbonation head assembly
    130 may function in a generally similar manner as the assembly disclosed in US 7,975,988.
   However, assembly 130 may also comprise additional features/functionality as may be
   disclosed hereinbelow.
   [0052]    To operate home soda machine 100, a user may first manually attach water bottle
25  170 by fitting it at an angle to carbonation head assembly 130 as shown in Fig. 1B. A
   carbonation process may then be initiated via a set of one or more controls (not shown).
   The control set may comprise a control to initiate carbonation; one or more additional
   controls may be configured to facilitate the selection of a desired level of carbonization
   (i.e. "weak/low", "regular/medium", "strong/high"). The present invention may include
30 any suitable controls such as are known in the art, including, for example, switches,
   pushbuttons, dials, etc.

                                                 - 10
   [0053]     Reference is now made to Fig. 4A which illustrates carbonation gear assembly
    150 as it may be positioned within an exemplary home soda machine 100. Carbonation
   gear assembly 150 may comprise motor 310, interlocking gears 320, carbonation cam 325
   and carbonation lever 330. Motor 310 may be configured to operate interlocking gears 320,
 5 which, in turn, may depress carbonation lever 330. It will be appreciated that the
   arrangement of interlocking gears 320 may be exemplary; any suitable arrangement such
   as known in the art to generate the necessary force required to depress lever 330 may be
   included in the present invention. Carbonation lever 330 may be configured such that when
   depressed, it may open a release valve on canister 140 (Fig. 3A) to release CO 2 into tubing
10 (not shown) that may introduce it into bottle 170 via carbonation injector 230 (Fig. IA).
   [0054]     Reference is now also made to Fig. 4B which illustrates a close up view of an
   exemplary carbonation cam 325. Carbonation cam 325 may be, for example, a raised area
   on one of interlocking gears 320. It will be appreciated however, that any suitable cam may
   be included in the present invention. Double action safety valve 270 may comprise contact
15 pin 275 and may be positioned in proximity to carbonation cam 325. Assembly 150 may
   be configured such that, when not in use, contact pin 275 may not be in direct contact with
   cam 325. However, when assembly 150 is to be activated as part of the carbonation
   process, motor 310 may rotate interlocking gears 320, thus placing cam 325 in direct
   contact with contact pin 275, effectively pushing contact pin 275 in the direction of Arrow
20 B. One or more sensors (not shown) may be positioned on one or both ends of cam 325 to
   sense when contact pin 275 makes contact with cam 325. It will be appreciated that any
   suitable sensors such as are known in the art may be included in the present invention. For
   example, the invention may include optical, proximity, and/or mechanical sensors.
   [0055]     It will be appreciated that motor 310 may rotate gears 320 such that cam 325 may
25 be in contact with contact pin 275 and lever 330 may be lowered towards canister 140 to
   release CO 2 for introduction into assembly 130. In accordance with a preferred
   embodiment of the present invention, during the carbonation process, motor 310 may
   rotate gears 320 back and forth one or more times, to thereby lower and raise lever 330 to
   release bursts of CO 2 from canister 140. It will be appreciated that the sensor(s) on cam
30 325 may signal when contact pin 275 is close to an edge of cam 325, at which point motor
   310 may reverse direction as per Arrows C (Fig. 4B), thus effectively maintaining contact

         R~dl~ltewovn\R~otbiDC\DX~l49068Ldocx-20/02/208
                                                        - 11
   between contact pin 275 and cam 325 during the carbonation process. Upon the
   completion of the carbonation process, motor 310 may rotate gears 320 to raise lever 330
   and to terminate contact between contact pin 275 and cam 325.
   [0056]       It will, however, be appreciated that the soda machine may be configured to use
 5 more than one type of gas canister 140. For example, some canisters 140 may have
   activating pins that require 30 newtons of force to open, whereas other canisters 140 may
   have activating pins that require as much as 150 newtons. Applicants have realized that it
   may not be possible to configure a spring mechanism for lever 330 that may be suitable for
   every possible level of pressure required to open canister 140. Such functionality may
10 interfere with the normal operation of machine 100 where carbonation lever 330 must be
   applied with sufficient force to depress the activation pin of canister 140. Accordingly, in
   accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the spring mechanism
   may be configured to yield under higher pressures such as when the force provided by the
   activation pin may be 30 newtons or more.
15 [0057]       As discussed hereinabove, it may be possible that a power outage may occur
   during the carbonation process while carbonation lever 330 (Fig. 4A) is depressed. In
   accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention, carbonation lever
   330 may also be configured with a spring mechanism that may leverage the pressure
   required to open canister 140. It will be appreciated that canisters 140 may be typically
20 opened by depressing an activating pin. As a safety measure, it may typically require
   significant pressure to depress the activating pin to open canister 140. The spring
   mechanism in lever 330 may be configured such that, in the event of a power outage while
   lever 330 is depressed to open canister 140, the pressure naturally returned by the
   activating pin may be significant enough to overcome the inertial pressure of lever 330
25 when it is no longer powered by motor 310.
   [0058]       It will be appreciated that features and functionality disclosed hereinabove may
   require a processor/controller unit with electrical input. Reference is now made to Fig. 5
   which illustrates an exemplary architecture for integrating such a unit within home soda
   machine 100. Architecture 500 may comprise mechanical features such as carbonation
30 head assembly 130, carbonation gear assembly 150, and pronged clamp 250 to introduce
   CO 2 from canister 140 to bottle 170 to produce carbonated water. Architecture 500 may

                                                 - 12
   also comprise controller unit 510 to automate and control the carbonation process.
   Controller unit 510 may be any suitable device such as known in the art that may generally
   be capable of providing the relevant functionality as described herein.
   [0059]   Controller unit 510 may receive input from one or more sensors, for example,
 5 bottle presence sensor 515, bottle full/empty sensor 520, attitude sensor 525, bottle size
   sensor 530 and/or CO 2 available sensor 560. Sensor 515 may indicate whether or not a
   bottle 170 has been properly inserted and clamped by pronged clamp 250. Sensor 520 may
   indicate whether or not bottle 170 is full. Sensor 525 may indicate whether or not home
   soda machine 100 is positioned in an upright manner. Sensor 530 may indicate the size of
10 bottle 170, for example, either a half liter or a full liter. CO 2 available sensor 560 may
   indicate whether or not there is CO9 in canister 140. It will be appreciated that sensors 515,
   520, 525, 530 and 560 may be implemented using any suitable sensors such as known in
   the art.
   [0060]   It will be appreciated that, based on input from these sensors, unit 510 may abort
15 or adjust a carbonation process. For example, if sensor 515 cannot detect bottle 170,
   controller unit 510 may abort the process. Controller unit 510 may also abort the process
   when sensor 525 indicates that home bottle 170 is not positioned in an upright manner.
   Carbonation in such circumstances may be adversely affected by gravity. Furthermore,
   removing a freshly carbonated bottle 170 from a non-upright position may be potentially
20 dangerous and in any case would certainly cause undesirable spillage.
   [0061]   In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention, home
   soda machine 100 may be configured with capacitor 550 to store an electrical charge
   during operation of machine 100. If a power outage occurs during the carbonation process,
   unit 510 may instruct motor 310 to rotate gears 320 in such a manner as to open double
25 action safety valve 270 and to raise lever 330 from connection with canister 140. The
   stored charge may provide sufficient power to motor 310 to execute the instructions.
   [0062]   Controller unit 510 may also use input from sensor 530 to adjust the process in
   accordance with the size of bottle 170. It will be appreciated that the present invention may
   include other sensors as well. For example, as discussed hereinabove, one or more sensors
30 may be used to ensure that plunger 275 may be in contact with cam 325 during the

                                                  - 13
   carbonation process. It will similarly be appreciated that the present invention may be
   configured without some or all of the sensors discussed herein.
   [0063]    As discussed hereinabove, home soda machine 100 may be configured to provide
   a variety of carbonation options depending on the preferences of its users. Such
 5 preferences may be indicated via soda level switches 540 and/or LCD user interface 590. It
   will be appreciated that any other suitable controls for indicating preferences and/or
   initiating the carbonation process may also be included in the present invention. Controller
   510 may be configured to continue the carbonation process until the water in water bottle
   160 is sufficiently carbonated in accordance with the preferences selected by the user.
10 [0064]    Accordingly, controller unit 510 may provide a variety of instructions to motor
   310 based on the preferences selected by the user. For example, home soda machine 100
   may be configured to provide "weak" carbonization with three timed bursts of C0 2 ;
   medium carbonization with four bursts of C0 2 ; and strong carbonization with five bursts of
   CO2 . Accordingly, if a user selects "medium", unit 510 may instruct motor 310 to rotate
15 interlocking gears 320 such that lever 330 may be depressed four times. It will be
   appreciated that the number of bursts listed hereinabove for each carbonization strength
   may be exemplary; the invention may be configured to provide a requested strength in
   accordance with any suitable combination of number/length/interval of bursts.
   [0065]    In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention, home
20 soda machine 100 may be configured with a watchdog mechanism 580 positioned between
   power input 599 and power supply 570. Watchdog mechanism 580 may be configured to
   monitor the length of time that the carbonation process has been running. In the event that
   the timing of the carbonation process exceeds a threshold, watchdog mechanism 580 may
   cut off the input from power input 599. For example, home soda machine 100 may be
25 configured to provide a maximum of 30 seconds of carbonation under the assumption that
   any more may result in unsafe conditions. In the event that continuous usage occurs for
   longer than a configurable threshold such as 30 seconds, it may be assumed that a
   runawaya"    event may be occurring. Accordingly, watchdog mechanism 580 may shut
   down the process in a brutal fashion by cutting off electrical input.
30 [0066]    It will be appreciated that after carbonation, the contents of water bottle 170 may
   be under significant pressure. It will therefore be appreciated that an immediate opening of

         R~dl~ltewovn\R~otbiDC\DX~l49068Ldocx-20/02/208
                                                        - 14
   the seal formed by pronged clamp 250 and water bottle 170 may create a "rocket effect"
   when bottle 170 is removed from machine 100. However, as disclosed hereinabove, double
   action safety valve 270 may revert to a normal open state whenever carbonation is not in
   process. Thus bottle 170 may be at least partially vented before its removal to mitigate the
 5 "rocket" effect.
   [0067]       Reference is now made to Fig. 6 which illustrates an additional safety feature
   designed to prevent such a "rocket effect" occurring. In accordance with a preferred
   embodiment of the present invention, safety valve 220 may be leveraged to provide a
   locking mechanism, to prevent the release of bottle 170 during an active carbonation
10 process. Fig. 6 illustrates a novel cam 600 comprising a recessed contact area 605.
   Recessed contact area 605 may be covered by a flat spring 610 which, together, may
   provide a mechanical stop to the movement of bottle 170. As shown in Fig. 6, when
   activating pin 280 is in contact with cam 600 during the carbonation process, flat spring
   610 may be depressed as depicted by flat spring 610A. Flat spring 610B may indicate the
15 normal state of flat spring 610, when the carbonation process is over and there is no longer
   any pressure in the bottle 170. It will be appreciated that as illustrated by comparing Fig.
    1B, cam 600 may be generally static when bottle 170 is released, whereas valve 220 may
   generally swing outwardly along with bottle 170. Accordingly, if activating pin 280 is
   lodged in recessed contact area 280, it may prevent such motion, essentially locking bottle
20  170 in place while carbonation is in process and there is pressure in bottle 170.
   [0068]       It will be appreciated that the present invention may include other such locking
   mechanisms for other home soda machines that may or may not be configured with safety
   valve 220 (Fig. 2). For example, mechanical, non-automated home soda machines may not
   require a novel cam 600 and spring 610, but may still be configured with pronged clamp
25 250. For such machines, any suitable locking mechanism such as known in the art may be
   used to prevent a user from releasing bottle 170 while simultaneously initiating
   carbonation. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention,
   mechanical home soda machines may be configured with a safety lock that may be
   engaged as soon bottle 170 is clasped by pronged clasp 250. In order to release bottle 170,
30 the user may first have to expressly unlock the safety lock, thus enabling at least partial
   release of built up CO 2 prior to bottle release and effectively preventing the rocket effect.

                                                 - 15
   [0069]    Reference is now made to Figs. 7A and 7B, which illustrate an exemplary locking
   mechanism for a non-automated machine. In this embodiment, the mechanical stop may be
   a rib 600 formed on a lever 610 of the machine. Rib 600 may have an elbow shape, with a
   relatively vertical portion 602, a relatively horizontal portion 604 and an elbow point 606.
 5 In addition, this embodiment may comprise a pronged clamp, denoted by a constricting
   ring 668, a pivot rod 614 and an assembly with an extension 612 which may move with
   respect to rib 600.
   [0070]    In a locked state, shown in Fig. 7A, lever 610 may be lowered with respect to a
   housing 620. In this position, bottle 170 may be engaged by the pronged clamp and thus,
10 may be upright. Constricting ring 668 may thus be horizontal and thus, extension 612,
   which may be perpendicular to constricting ring 668, may be vertical. Lever 610 may be
   located such that extension 612 may extend past rib portion 602. Since rib portion 602 may
   jut out from lever 610, rib portion 602 may prevent extension 612 from rotating and thus,
   may prevent a user from removing bottle 170 from the pronged clamp which is constricted
15 by constricting ring 668.
   [0071]    When lever 610 may be raised, as shown in Fig. 7B, it may raise rib 600 with
   respect to extension 612. Vertical rib portion 602 may be raised such that the tip of
   extension 612 may pass elbow point 606. As a result, the tip of extension 612 may no
   longer be constrained by vertical rib portion 602. In this state, the bottle as held by the
20 pronged clamp may be rotated and thus, constricting rib 668 is shown in both a vertical and
   a rotated state.
   [0072]    Thus, in this embodiment, only once lever 610 may be raised, such as may happen
   after carbonation, can the bottle be removed from the pronged clamp. Rib 600 may provide
   a mechanical stop to the rotation of the bottle. In this manner, the removal of the bottle
25 after carbonation may occur a few seconds after carbonation finishes, which may enable
   sufficient excess gasses to escape to prevent the rocket effect.
   [0073]    Unless specifically stated otherwise, as apparent from the preceding discussions,
   it is appreciated that, throughout the specification, discussions utilizing terms such as
   "processing," "computing," "calculating," "determining," or the like, refer to the action
30 and/or processes of a computer, computing system, or similar electronic computing device
   that manipulates and/or transforms data represented as physical, such as electronic,

                                                - 16
   quantities within the computing system's registers and/or memories into other data
   similarly represented as physical quantities within the computing system's memories,
   registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.
   [0074]    Embodiments of the present invention may include apparatus for performing the
 5 operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the desired purposes, or
   it may comprise a general-purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a
   computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a
   computer readable storage medium, such as, but not limited to, any type of disk, including
   floppy disks. optical disks, magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), compact
10 disc read-only memories (CD-ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), electrically
   programmable read-only memories (EPROMs), electrically erasable and programmable
   read only memories (EEPROMs), magnetic or optical cards, Flash memory, or any other
   type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions and capable of being coupled to a
   computer system bus.
15 [0075]    Many modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing
   from the scope of the present invention as hereinbefore described with reference to the
   accompanying drawings.
   [0076]    Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the context
   requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" and
20 "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group
   of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or
   steps.
   [0077]    The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived
   from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as an
25 acknowledgment or admission or any form of suggestion that that prior publication (or
   information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general
   knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates.
