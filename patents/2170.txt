detection, imaging, diagnosis, targeting, treatment, etc. of
cancers expressing the gastrin releasing peptide receptor
 (GRPR).   For example, such probes may be molecules
conjugated to detectable labels which are preferably

   RADIOLABELED GRPR-ANTAGONISTS FOR DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING AND
                TREATMENT OF GRPR-POSITIVE CANCER
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional
Patent Application No.   61/705,513  filed September 25, 2012,
which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety.
BACKGROUND OF THE   INVENTION
[0002]Cancer cells have been shown to express a variety of
specific biomolecules   such as peptide-receptors, which may
serve as recognition sites    for a wide range of circulating
vectors,   as for example peptide-ligands.  In case the
expression of the target-receptor is higher on malignant
cells than in surrounding healthy tissue, the opportunity
arises to exploit the interaction between these two
molecular entities. For diagnostic imaging or targeted
therapy applications, a natural peptide-ligand could be
modified to stably bind a diagnostic or a therapeutic
radionuclide, e.g. a radiometal or a radiohalogen.
[0003] In many cases, a bifunctional chelator is covalently
coupled via a carboxyl-functionality to the N-terminal amine
of the peptide-ligand to form a peptide bond. In order to
increase the biological stability, hydrophilicity, receptor
binding affinity and/or internalization efficacy, further
modifications of native receptor ligands are attempted, such
as strategic amino acid replacements in the peptide chain.
Alternatively, introduction of suitable spacers between the
chelator and the peptide receptor recognition site or
hetero/homo peptide-multimerization may equally lead to
advantageous improvements of many biological parameters
                                 1

WO 2014/052471                                       PCT/US2013/061712
eventually improving overall pharmacokinetics and target
accumulation of the radioactive probe.
[0004] The resulting peptide-chelate conjugate after labeling
with a diagnostic or a therapeutic radionuclide
 (radiopeptide) is administered to the patient. The
radiopeptide selectively accumulates on cancer-site(s)
through specific interaction with the target-molecule, i.e.
its cognate peptide-receptor, highly expressed on the tumor.
In case of a diagnostic radionuclide, the tumor and
metastases are then localized by imaging the site(s) where
the radioactive decay occurs using an external imaging
device. When the peptide-chelate conjugate is labeled with a
therapeutic radionuclide, a radiotoxic load is delivered
specifically to the primary tumor and its metastases.          The
therapeutic radionuclide will then decay on the cancer
site(s),    releasing corpuscular energy to kill or to reduce
 (the growth of)     the lesions.
[0005] This    strategy has been elegantly exploited in the area
of somatostatin and its receptors. The latter are abundantly
expressed in a variety of human tumors, and especially in
neuroendocrine tumors       (NETs). The advent of OctreoScan*
 (["'In-DTPA]octreotide) in clinical practice      for the
successful diagnostic imaging of NETs was soon followed by
many new improved somatostatin analogs labeled with a wide
range of medically relevant radiometals useful not only for
conventional imaging with a gamma-camera, but also for PET
and, most importantly, for radionuclide therapy. Ongoing
clinical trials have revealed the therapeutic efficacy of
these new radiopeptides.
[0006] Peptide-receptors and their ligands have emerged as
attractive molecular tools in cancer diagnosis and therapy.
For example, high density expression of gastrin releasing
peptide receptors      (GRPRs) has been documented in several
                                    2

WO 2014/052471                                       PCT/US2013/061712
frequently occurring human tumors, such as       in prostate
cancer, mammary carcinoma and lung cancer. As a consequence,
GRPRs have lately been gaining momentum as preferred
molecular targets for radiolabeled bombesin-like peptides
with the aim to upgrade the diagnostic and therapeutic
arsenal of nuclear oncology.
[0007]Bombesin     (BBN) is a tetradecapeptide initially isolated
from the skin of the European frog Bombina bombina. Bombesin
and its related peptides affect thermoregulation and food
intake after binding to specific receptors in humans. These
receptors comprise three subtypes in mammals, the neuromedin
B receptor      (NMBR or BBiR) with a high affinity for NMB,     the
GRPR   (or BB 2 R) with a high affinity for GRP and the BB3R,
which is an orphan receptor with no-known ligand identified
yet. Amphibian BBN binds to NMBR and GRPR subtypes with a
high affinity. NMB and GRP are the mammalian counterparts of
amphibian BBN and are all related in structure.
[0008]Most radiolabeled BBN-like peptides developed for
molecular imaging and radionuclide therapy of human tumors
have been based on native BBN, or on its C-terminal
octapeptide fragment still able to bind the GRPR. These
analogs modified as detailed above typically exhibit
agonistic properties and internalize in the intracellular
region of malignant cells after binding to the GRPR. This
property translates into a high accumulation of the
radiolabel     in  the GRPR+ lesions, thereby enhancing either
diagnostic sensitivity or therapeutic efficacy.
[0009]Unfortunately, BBN-like peptides are potent GRPR
agonists, eliciting adverse effects related to
gastrointestinal motility and thermoregulation when
intravenously      (iv) administered in human even in small
amounts.     In addition, BBN-like peptides are mitogenic. The
above properties have restrained the thorough clinical
                                    3

WO 2014/052471                                         PCT/US2013/061712
validation and/or the eventual commercial exploitation of a
few promising agonist-based radiolabeled bombesins. This is
particularly relevant in the case of targeted radionuclide
therapy whereby higher peptide amounts need to be iv
administered in patients.
[0010]Unlike radiolabeled BBN agonists, radiolabeled
somatostatin-agonists, which internalize equally well into
somatostatin receptor-expressing malignant cells, do not
elicit undesirable physiological effects after iv injection
in humans. This fact has fostered the extended and
systematic clinical validation of a few promising
radiolabeled somatostatins even in the domain of
radionuclide tumor therapy.
[0011] The radiotracer    99 mTc] Demobesin 1,
                        ([m                     9 9 Tc-N ' ] DPhe-Gln
                                               [m       4
Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-NHEt) is known and used in mice
bearing human prostate cancer PC-3 xenografts, where
 [9m Tc]Demobesin  1 showed exceptionally superior
pharmacokinetic properties as opposed to similarly affine
bombesin-based agonists, as for example [99mTc]Demobesin 3-6.
Besides its significantly higher tumor accumulation,
 [9mTc]Demobesin 1 cleared very rapidly from the body of mice
and the pancreas, a strongly GRPR-positive organ.
[0012]Although first studies in a limited number of prostate
cancer patients verified the excellent tolerability of the
radiotracer, they revealed a sub-optimal pharmacokinetic
profile in humans preventing a further expanded clinical
application as a diagnostic imaging tool. More specifically,
 [9mTc]Demobesin 1 despite its rapid body and pancreas
clearance and its rather good in vivo stability, exhibited
insufficient retention in malignant lesions in humans as
compared to radiolabeled BBN-like agonists. Furthermore,
 [99mTc]Demobesin 1 was designed for diagnostic imaging using
conventional gamma camera or SPECT and is unsuitable for PET
                                    4

or radionuclide therapy applications. Although labeling with
the PET radionuclide 9mTc is        feasible by means of the
acyclic N4 -system,    the medical     use of this  radionuclide    is
restricted both by sub-optimal nuclear characteristics and
inconvenient production. On the other hand, therapeutic
                                 6 188
options are restricted     to 11  /    Re, as the N 4 -chelator cannot
stably bind most of bi-     and trivalent radiometals used in
nuclear medicine.
[0013]According to one broad form of the present invention
there is provided means to achieve high uptake and retention
of a diagnostic and a therapeutic radiolabel selectively to
GRPR+-cancer, both primary and metastatic.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0023] The research leading to the invention has unexpectedly
revealed an alternative route for effective in vivo
targeting of somatostatin-positive tumors, namely the use of
somatostatin receptor antagonists. Most surprisingly and
against their inability to internalize, such analogs have
shown a much higher uptake and retention in animal
xenografts and a very rapid washout from background tissues.
[0024] A tentative explanation for the higher tumor uptake of
somatostatin receptor antagonists is their ability to bind
to a significantly higher number of the overall somatostatin
receptor population available on the cell-membrane of cancer
cells than their internalizing agonistic counterparts.
                                                16

WO 2014/052471                                         PCT/US2013/061712
[0025]According to the invention, GRPR-antagonists are
chemically modified to accommodate a diagnostic and/or
therapeutic radionuclide that they stably bind. After
administration in a human or an animal subject they serve as
a molecular vehicle to transfer a radiodiagnostic signal
and/or a radiotoxic load on the primary GRPR+-tumor and its
metastases.
[0026]More specifically, it was found according to the
invention that administration of certain novel GRPR
antagonist-based radioligands unexpectedly resulted in an
unprecedentedly high and specific uptake and a remarkably
prolonged retention of human GRPR+-xenografts        in  mice in
contrast to    [99mTc]Demobesin 1. Furthermore, these agents
showed significantly higher metabolic stability after
injection in mice, compared to       [I9 Tc]Demobesin 1.
[0027] The GRPR-antagonists of the invention have important
structural differences in relation to the original
 [99mTc]Demobesin 1 motif. Firstly, their labeling with a wide
range of bi- and trivalent radiometals, but also with smTc
and '"'.Re,    is made possible by coupling of suitable
bifunctional chelators at their N-terminus in addition to
tetraamine-related frameworks. In this way, radiodiagnostic
imaging is possible with SPECT and PET with gamma and
positron-emitters while labeling with beta-, Auger and alpha
emitters is feasible as well, opening the opportunity for
therapeutic applications. Then, their metabolic stability
and pharmacokinetic profile, especially in terms of tumor
retention has largely improved, as demonstrated by
preclinical biodistribution results in female SCID mice
bearing human PC-3 xenografts presented at length.
[0028]More specifically, the structure of new analogs
comprises the following parts:
                                  17

WO 2014/052471                                                PCT/US2013/061712
        a) The chelator attached to the N-terminus -              this can
be either an acyclic or a cyclic tetraamine, HYNIC, N3S
chelators and derivatives thereof, linear or cyclic
polyamines and polyaminopolycarboxylates like DTPA, EDTA,
DOTA, NOTA, NOTAGA, TETA and their derivatives, a.o.                  In
addition, a suitable group, such a prosthetic group or a
Tyr, for labeling with radiohalogens, can be                introduced at
this position;
        b) The radionuclide -         this may be i) a gamma emitter,
such as    9Tc,    -"In,     6 Ga, 1I,    1I,   a.o.,   suitable for
imaging with a conventional gamma-camera, a SPECT or an
hybrid SPECT/CT or SPECT/MRI system;              ii)  a positron emitter,
such as    6Ga, "Ga, 64Cu,        8Y, 44Sc,   1I,   "F, a.o.,    suitable
for imaging with a PET or a hybrid PET/CT or PET/MRI system,
or iii) a beta, Auger or alpha emitter, such as                16Re,    1Re,
 9Y,   " Lu, " In,       6Cu,   2 Bi,  "Yb,   4Sc,   1 I,  1 I, etc.,
suitable for radionuclide therapy;
        c) The spacer between the chelator and the peptide
motif, which may vary in length, type and lipophilicity and
may include PEGx          (x= 0-20),   natural and unnatural amino
acids,    sugars, alkylamino residues or combinations thereof;
        d) The peptide chain, with strategic amino acid
replacements undertaken with D-amino acids, unnatural amino
acids and other suitable residues.
        e) The C-terminus, wherein the both Leu13 and Met               4
                                                                         -NH 2
in the native BBN sequence have been omitted. Terminal His'2
is present as      the amidated or ester form, whereby amides               or
esters may be represented by several mono- and di
alkylamides, aromatic amides or mixed alkyl-aryl amides,                    or
alkyl and/or aryl esters.

EXAMPLE
INTRODUCTION
[0040]Compounds of the invention were made and tested as
described below.        The following disclosed embodiments are
merely representative of the invention which may be embodied
in various forms.        Thus, specific structural, functional,
and procedural details disclosed in the following examples
are not to be interpreted as limiting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Radiolabeling and QC
Labeling with     " 'In
[0041] Indium (In-111) chloride in 50 mM HCl was purchased
from Mallinckrodt Medical B.V.,        Petten, The Netherlands, at
an activity concentration of 10-20 mCi/mL. In general, DOTA
peptide conjugates of the present invention were
radiolabeled with Indium-111 at specific activities of 0.1
0.2 mCi In-111/nmol DOTA-peptide conjugate. Briefly, 3-15
nmol of DOTA-peptide conjugate dissolved in water was mixed
with 2.5-12.5 pL of 1.0 M pH 4.6 sodium acetate buffer, 1-5
pL of 0.1 M sodium ascorbate in water and 30-150 pL of
  "InCl 3  (0.3-3.0 mCi).    The radiolabeling reaction mixture was
incubated in a boiling water bath for 20 to 30 min. For
quality control a 2 pL aliquot of the radiolabeling solution
was quenched with 28 pL of an acetate buffered solution of
Na 2 -EDTA (5 mM, pH 4.6).     After a successful radiolabeling
 (more than 95 % peptide-bound radioactivity) Na2 -EDTA         (0.1 M,

pH 4.6) was added to the radiolabeling solution to a final
concentration of 1 mM.
Labeling with        "Ga
[0042]Gallium      (Ga-67) chloride was obtained either in dilute
HCl at an activity concentration of 498 -            743 mCi/mL from
Nordion, Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, Canada or at an activity
concentration of 80 mCi/mL from Mallinckrodt Medical B.V.,
Petten, The Netherlands.
[0043] In general, DOTA-peptide conjugates of the present
invention were radiolabeled with Gallium-67 at specific
activities of 0.1-0.2 mCi Ga-67/nmol DOTA-peptide conjugate.
Briefly, 3-15 nmol of DOTA-peptide conjugate dissolved in
water was mixed with 50-125 pL of 1.0 M pH 4.0 sodium
acetate buffer and 5-15 pL of 6GaCl 3           (0.5-3.0 mCi.  The
radiolabeling reaction mixture was incubated in a boiling
water bath for 30 min. For HPLC quality control a 2 pL
aliquot of the radiolabeling solution was quenched with 28
pL of an acetate buffered solution of Na 2 -EDTA          (5 mM,   pH
4.0).   After a successful labeling          (more than 95 % peptide
bound radioactivity)        Na 2 -EDTA  (0.1 M, pH 4.0)  was added to
the radiolabeling solution to a final concentration of 1
mM.
Labeling with 177Lu
[0044]Lutetium       (Lu-177) chloride in 50 mM HCl was purchased
from IDB Radiopharmacy, The Netherlands, at an activity
concentration of 100 mCi/mL.
[0045] In general, DOTA-peptide conjugates of the present
invention were radiolabeled with Lutetium-177 to a specific
activity of up to 0.5 mCi Lu-177/nmol DOTA-peptide
conjugate. Briefly, 3-15 nmol of DOTA-peptide conjugate
dissolved in water was mixed with 4-16 pL of 1.0 M pH 4.6

sodium acetate buffer and 15-75                 pL of "GaCl   3   (1.5-7.5   mCi).
Radiolysis was minimized by the addition of 5 pl of gentisic
acid      (80 mM) dissolved in 0.2 M sodium ascorbate. The
reaction mixture was incubated in a boiling water bath for
30 min. For HPLC quality control a 2 pL aliquot of the
radiolabeling solution was quenched with 28 pL of an acetate
buffered       solution of Na    2 -EDTA     (5  mM,   pH 4.6).   After a
successful radiolabeling              (more than 95 % peptide-bound
radioactivity)        Na 2 -EDTA    (0.1 M, pH 4.6)       was   added to the
radiolabeling solution to a final concentration of 1 mM.

[0046] Tetraamine-coupled peptides were dissolved in 50 mM
acetic acid/EtOH 8/2 v/v to a final 1 mM peptide
concentration. Each bulk solution was distributed in 50 pL
aliquots in Eppendorf tubes and stored at -200C. Labeling
was conducted in an Eppendorf vial, wherein the following
solutions were consecutively added:                   i)  0.5 M phosphate
buffer pH 11.5         (50 pL),     ii)   0.1 M sodium citrate         (5 pL,

freshly made SnCl        2  solution     in   EtOH    (30 pg,   15 pL).   After
reaction for 30 min at ambient temperature, the pH was
brought to        ~7 by adding 1 M HCl          (10 pL).
Quality Control
[0047]HPLC analyses were conducted on a Waters Chromatograph
 (Waters, Vienna, Austria) efficient with a 600 solvent
delivery system; the chromatograph was coupled to twin
detection instrumentation, comprising a photodiode array UV
detector        (either Waters model         996 or model 2998) and a Gabi
gamma detector from Raytest               (RSM Analytische        Instrumente
GmbH, Germany).         Data processing and chromatography were
                                            30

controlled via the Millennium or Empower 2 Software                   (Waters,
USA).   A XBridge Shield RP18 column           (5 pm, 4.6   x  150 mm,
Waters,    Ireland) coupled to the respective 2-cm guard column
was eluted at 1 ml/min flow rate with a linear gradient
system starting from 10%          B and advancing to 70% B within 60
min,  with solvent A = 0.1%         aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and
solvent B = acetonitrile.
Metabolic study in Mice
Radioligand injection and blood collection
[0048]A bolus containing the radioligand in normal                 saline
 (100-150 pL, :3 nmol, 200-500 pCi) was injected in the tail
vein of Swiss albino mice. Animals were kept               for 5 min in a
cage with access to water and were then euthanized promptly
by cardiac puncture while under a mild ether anesthesia.
Blood    (500-900 pL) was collected from the heart with a
syringe and transferred in a pre-chilled Eppendorf tube on
ice.
Plasma separation and sample preparation
[0049]Blood was centrifuged to remove blood cells                 (10 min,
2000 g/4 0 C).    The plasma was collected, mixed with
acetonitrile       (MeCN) in a 1/1 v/v ratio and centrifuged again
 (10 min,    15000 g/40C) .    Supernatants were       concentrated to a
small volume       (gentle N 2 -flux  at 400 C),  diluted   with saline        (
400 pL) and filtered through a Millex GV filter                 (0.22 pm).
HPLC Analysis for radiometabolite detection
[0050]Aliquots of plasma samples          (prepared as described
above) were loaded on a Symmetry Shield RPM column which was
eluded at      a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with the following
gradient:      100% A to 90%     A in 10 min and from 90%        A to 60%

for the next 60 min         (A= 0.1%   aqueous TFA    (v/v) and B =
MeCN).   Elution of radiocomponents was monitored by a gamma
detector. For        EmTc-radiopeptides,    ITLC-SG analysis was
performed in parallel using acetone as the eluent to detect
traces of      TcO4-  release   (TcO4-  Rf = 1.0)
Studies in      GRPR+-Tumor Bearing Mice
Tumor induction
[0051]A ~150 pL bolus containing a suspension of 1.5              x   107
freshly harvested human PC-3 cells in normal saline was
subcutaneously injected in the flanks of female               SCID mice.
The animals were kept under aseptic conditions and 2-3 weeks
later developed well-palpable tumors at the inoculation site
 (80-150 mg).
Biodistribution and calculation of results
[0052]On the day of the experiment, the selected radiopeptide
was injected in the tail vein of tumor-bearing mice as                  a 100
pL bolus     (1-2 pCi,    10 pmol total peptide;       in saline/EtOH 9/1
v/v).   Animals were sacrificed in groups of four under a mild
ether anesthesia by cardiac puncture at predetermined time
points pi      (postinjection). Additional sets of three to four
                                                     4
animals were co-injected with excess            [Tyr   ]BBN (z40  nmol)
along with test radiopeptide and were sacrificed at 4 h pi
 (blocked animals).       Samples of blood and tissues of interest
were immediately collected, weighed and measured for
radioactivity in a y-counter. Stomach and intestines were
not emptied of their contents, but measured as collected.
Biodistribution data were calculated as percent injected
dose per gram tissue         (%ID/g) using the Microsoft Excel
program with the aid of suitable standards of the injected
dose.
