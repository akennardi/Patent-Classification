       METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING FRACTIONAL
                              SUBFRAME TRANSMISSION
[0001] The present invention is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No.
2015381655 which has a filing date of 3 February 2016, the contents of which are hereby
incorporated in its entirety.
TECHNICAL FIELD
[0001 a] Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to communication techniques.
More particularly, embodiments of the present invention relate to a method and apparatus for
performing fractional subframe transmission.
BACKGROUND
[0002] In 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the network structure and various
technologies needed for a terniinal's movement between a 3GPP wireless communication
network and a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) network are called interworking WLAN.
The multi-mode wireless communication technology has evolved to use multiple wireless
communication technologies at the same time. The use of multiple wireless communication
technologies simultaneously thereby increases transfer rates per unit time or improves the
reliability of the terminal.
[0003] In wireless communication, spectrum is very rare resource. A licensed band represents a
frequency band that is exclusively licensed to a specific operator to provide specific wireless
services. On the other hand, an unlicensed band represents a frequency band that is not
allocated to a specific operator, but is opened so that all entities meeting the predefined
requirements may use the frequency band.
[0004] In some regions in the world, unlicensed band technologies need to abide to certain
regulations, for example, Listen-Before-Talk (LBT), and channel bandwidth occupancy
requirements. LBT results in an uncertainty of channel availability. For instance, an unlicensed
band may be available at any time during a subframe.
1'2OCAOC 1

                                                la
[0005] WLAN that uses Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) is the typical wireless communication
technology used in the unlicensed band. Time granularity of current Long Term Evolution
(LTE) is much larger than that of WiFi, which leads to the low competitive strength of License
Assisted Access (LAA) with LBT. As such, fair coexistence between LTE and other
technologies such as WiFi as well as between LTE operators is expected. In order to be more
competitive in the unlicensed band, fractional subframe
1'2;OC;O 1

     transmission may be performed.
     [0006] The fractional subframe transmission may use at least one fractional subframe.
     Since merely a portion of symbols of a factional subframe are available for data
     transmission, the end of the fractional subframe transmission may be uncertain.
  5  However, for both a transmitter and a receiver, the end of the fractional subframe
     transmission is an important factor for perform the fractional subframe transmission
     efficiently. Therefore, there is a need to estimate the end of the fractional subframe
    transmission.
10   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
     [00071 The present invention proposes a solution regarding fractional subframe
    transmission.   Specifically, the present invention provides a method and apparatus for
    estimate the end of the fractional subframe transmission.

15  embodiments of the invention provide a method for performing fractional subframe
    transmission.   The method may comprise: detennining first temporal information that

    temporal information and transmission opportunity information, second temporal
    information that indicates an end of the fractional subframe transmission.  The method
20  may be performed at a transmitter or a receiver.
    [0009] According to a second aspect of embodiments of the present invention,
    embodiments of the invention provide an apparatus for performing fractional subframe
    transmission.   The apparatus may comprise: a first determining unit configured to

25  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
    [0020] The subject matter described herein will now be discussed with reference to
    several example embodiments.        It should be understood these embodiments are
    discussed only for the purpose of enabling those skilled persons in the art to better
    understand and thus implement the subject matter described herein, rather than
                                                3

    suggesting any limitations on the scope of the subject matter.
    [0021] The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular
    embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of example embodiments.           As
   used herein, the singular forms "a," "an" and "the" are intended to include the plural
 5 fonrs as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.          It will be further
   understood that the terms "comprises," "comprising," "includes" and/or "including,"
   when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations,
   elements and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or
   more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components and/or groups
10 thereof.
    [0022] It should also be noted that in some alternative implementations,              the
   functions/acts noted may occur out of the order noted in the figures.    For example, two
   functions or acts shown in succession may in fact be executed concurrently or may
   sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality/acts
15 involved.
    [00231 Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a solution for performing
   fractional subframe transmission.    The solution may be carried out between a receiver
   and a transmitter.      In particular, the transmitter may determine first temporal
   information that indicates when a channel becomes available and determine second
20 temporal information that indicates an end of the fractional subframe transmission based
   on the first temporal information and transmission opportunity information.           The
   receiver may determine the second temporal information in a similar way          As such,
   both the transmitter and the receiver may determine the end of the fractional subframe
   transmission without introducing signalling overhead.
25  10024] In embodiments of the present invention, a fractional subframe may refer to a
   subframe for downlink transmission or a subframe for uplink transmission, wherein one
   part of the fractional subframe is used for transmission of control information or data
   and the other part is not used for the transmission.        For example, for a subframe
   comprising 14 symbols, if only the last 6 symbols are used for transmission while the
30 first 8 symbols are not used for the transmission, this subframe may be considered as a
   factional subframe.    For another example, if the first 7 symbols of a subframe are used
                                                4

   for transmission while the remaining symbols of the subframe are not used for the
   transmission, this subframe may be considered as a factional subframe as well.
    [0025] In the disclosure, the fractional subframe transmission may refer to the
   transmission performed on one or more subframes, and at least one of the one or more
 5 subframes is a fractional subframe.     By way of example, the fractional subframe
   transmission may comprise various cases, such as the first subframe being a fractional
   subframe, the last subframe being a fractional subframe, both the first and the last
   subframes being fractional subframes, and the like.
   [00261 In some embodiments, the fractional subframe transmission may be downlink or
10 uplink cellular transmission.   In downlink transmission, the receiver may comprise
   user equipment (UE), such as a terminal, a Mobile Terminal (MT), a Subscriber Station
   (SS), a Portable Subscriber Station (PSS), Mobile Station (MS), or an Access Terminal
   (AT).    Meanwhile, the transmitter may comprise a base station (BS), such as a node B
   (NodeB or NB), or an evolved NodeB (eNodeB or eNB).            In uplink transmission, the
15 transmitter may comprise a UE and the receiver may comprise a BS.
   [0027] According to some other embodiments of the present invention, the fractional
   subframe transmission may be D2D transmission.       In this regard, the receiver may be a
   Device-to-Device (D2D) receiver and the transmitter may be a D2D transmitter.
   [0028] Embodiments of the present invention may be applied in various communication
20 systems, including but not limited to a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system or a Long
   Tenn Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) system.             Given the rapid development in
   communications, there will of course also be future type wireless communication
   technologies and systems with which the present invention may be embodied.               It
   should not be seen as limiting the scope of the invention to only the aforementioned
25 system.
   [0029] Now some exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described
   below with reference to the figures.  Reference is first made to FIG. 1, which illustrates
   a flow chart of a method 100 for performing fractional subfrarne transmission at a
   transmitter according to an embodiment of the invention.        The method 100 may be
30 performed at a transmitter and other suitable device.      Alternatively, the method 100
   may be performed at a receiver and other suitable device.
                                              5

   [00301 The method 100 starts at step S110, in which first temporal information is
   determined, wherein the first temporal infonnation indicates when a channel becomes
   available.
   [0031] In context of the disclosure, a subframe may comprise a plurality of symbols.
 5 By way of example, a subframe may be 1 ms and comprise 14 symbols, for example,
   symbols 0 to 13.      A position, such as a potential position, a target position, a current
   position, a next position, may refer to a time point or a time period in the subframe.     In
   some embodiments, a position may correspond to an instant in a subframe. As an
   alternative, a position may correspond to a symbol of a subframe.        In this regard, the
10 position may occupy a time period, for example, the time period of a symbol.        A target
   position may refer to a position from which the fractional transmission may start, and a
   potential position may refer to a predefined position that is a candidate of the target
   position.
   [0032] There may be one or more potential positions predefined in a subframe.          Each
15 of the potential positions may correspond to a symbol of the subframe periodically or
   aperiodically.    In some embodiments, the potential positions may comprise every three
   symbols, for example, symbols 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12.      For instance, the potential positions
   may be set at
                                    mod (N, Nd) = x (x E [0,Nd-1]),                          (1)
20 where N represents the index of a symbol in a subframe, and Nd represents the interval
   between two potential positions and may be an integer ranged from 1 to the total
   number of symbols in the subframe, for example 14.       According to equation (1), it may
   be determined that the smaller the Nd is, the denser the potential positions are.          In
   some embodiments, each symbol in a subframe may be predefined as a potential
25 position.
   [0033] It is to be noted that the above examples are illustrated for example, rather than
   limitation.    It can be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, there may be
   aperiodic configurations of the potential positions.   For instance, the potential positions
   may correspond to the symbols 0, 3, 8 and 12.
30 [0034] Clear Chanel Assessment (CCA) or Extended Clear Chanel Assessment (eCCA)
   may be performed, for example by the transmitter, to detect whether a channel is
                                                6

    available.  In response to detecting that the channel becomes available, whether a
    current position is a potential position may be detected.     If the current position is a
   potential position, the current position may be determined as the target position;
   otherwise, a channel occupation signal may be transmitted from the current position
 5 until a potential position, and this potential position may be determined as the target
   position.   In some embodiments, this potential position may be a potential position
   immediately following the current position.        For example, if the current position
   corresponds to symbol 5, and there are three predefined potential positions
   corresponding to symbols 0, 7 and 11, it may be determined that the potential position
10 corresponding to symbol 7 is a potential position immediately following the current
   position and may be determined as the target position.
    [00351 According to embodiments of the present invention, the fractional subframe
   transmission may be symbol-level transmission.           In other words, the fractional
   subframe transmission may be ended at any symbol of a subframe.           In this case, it is
15 possible that the last subframe of the fractional subframe transmission is a fractional
   subframe.    The first temporal information may be determined in several ways.             In
   some embodiments, whether the channel becomes available at a symbol of a first
   subframe may be determined.        In response to determining that the channel becomes
   available, the first temporal information may be determined as comprising an index of
20 the symbol.    Alternatively, in some embodiments, in response to determining that the
   channel becomes available, the first temporal information may be determined as
   comprising a potential position predefined in the first subframe, wherein the potential
   position is immediately prior to the symbol.     Details will be described with reference
   to FIGs. 2 and 3.
25 [0036] Alternatively, the fractional subframe transmission may be subframe-level
   transmission.    In this case, the fractional subframe transmission may be ended at a
   complete subframe.      In other words, the last subframe of the fractional subframe
   transmission is a complete subframe, instead of a fractional subframe.        According to
   embodiments of the present invention, at step S110, a first subframe at which the
30 channel becomes available may be detennined.         Then, the first temporal information
   may be determined as comprising an index of the first subframe.
                                                7

     [0037] In some embodiments, step S110 may be performed by the transmitter. In this
    case, the first subframe may be determined based on CCA/eCCA perfonrined by the
    transmitter.    In particular, when the transmitter detect a channel becomes available at a
    subframe, this subframe may be detennined as the first subframe.
  5  [0038] In some other embodiments, step S110 may be performed by the receiver.           In
    an exemplary embodiment, the transmitter may notify the first temporal information, for
    example, by sending an indicator regarding the first temporal information to the receiver.
    In this way, the index of the first subframe at which a channel becomes available may
    be indicated explicitly.      Thus, at step S110, the receiver may determine the first
10  temporal information by detecting the indicator. In an alternative embodiment, the
    transmitter may not send the indicator, and the receiver may make blind decoding for
    control information of the fractional subframe transmission at a potential position.     In
    response to that the blind decoding is success, the receiver may determine the index of
    the first subframe of the fractional subframe transmission.
15  [0039] At step S120, second temporal information that indicates an end of the fractional
    subframe transmission may be determined based on the first temporal information and
    transmission opportunity information.
    [0040] According to        embodiments of the present invention, the transmission
    opportunity information may include channel occupancy time, for example, maximum
20  channel occupancy time, average channel occupancy time, and so on.                     The
    transmission opportunity information may be determined based on regulations or other
    possible aspects.        Additionally or alternatively, the transmission       opportunity
    information may be configured by higher layer signalling or may be preset as being
    fixed.
25  [0041] In some embodiments where the symbol-level transmission is performed, at step
    S120, a number of symbols used by the fractional subframe transmission may be
    determined based on the transmission opportunity information.        Then, a number of end
    symbols may be determined based on the first temporal infonnation and the number of
    symbols used by the fractional subframe transmission, wherein the end symbols are
30  used by the fractional subframe transmission and belong to a last subframe of the
    fractional subframe transmission.      Details will be described with reference to FIGs. 2
                                                   8

    and 3.
    [0042] Alternatively, in some embodiments where the subframe-level transmission is
    performed, at step Si 20, an index of a last subframe used by the fractional subframe
    transmission may be detennined based on the first temporal information and
 5  transmission opportunity information.
    [0043] In an exemplary embodiment, the index of the last subframe may be determined
    as follows:
                                       Ne=NJ + floor (TXOP) -1                             (2)
    where N] represents the index of the first subframe, Ne represents the index of the last
10  subframe, TXOP represents the channel occupancy time in millisecond (i.e., ms), and
   floorO indicates an operation of rounding down.
    100441 FIG. 6 illustrates a schematic diagram 600 of subframe-level fractional subframe
    transmission according to embodiments of the invention.       As shown in FIG. 6, there
    are 4 subframes, i.e., subframes 0 to 3. With respect to subframe 0, there are two
15  potential positions 621 and 622, wherein the first potential position 621 corresponds to
    the start of subframe 0.    CCA/eCCA may start from the first potential position 621, and
    the potential position 622 may be determined as the target position.        The factional
    subframe transmission then may start from the target position and ends at the end of
    subframe 2.     Thus, the real channel occupation time, which indicates the actual time
20  period occupied by the fractional subframe transmission, may correspond to a time
    period from the positions 622 to 623.     Assuming that TXOP is 3ms and corresponds to
    a time period from the position 622 to the position 624, it may be determined that the
    actual channel occupation time is from the position 622 to the position 623 and a time
    period from the position 623 to the position 624 is not occupied.    In the embodiments
25  of FIG. 6, since the first subframe is subframe 0, the index of the first subframe is 0.
    Thus, according to equation (2), it may be determined that the index of the last subframe
   Ne is 0+3-1=2.      In other words, the last subframe may be determined as subframe 2.
    [0045] According to embodiments of the present invention, optionally, if the
    symbol-level transmission is performed, the method 100 may further comprise a step of
30  comparing the number of end symbols with a predetermined threshold.        Responsive to
    that the number of end symbols is less than or equal to a predetermined threshold, the
                                                  9

   last subframe may be released.        In an alternative embodiment, responsive to that the
   number of end symbols is less than or equal to a predetennined threshold, the end
    symbols may be combined with a subframe immediately prior to the last subframe.           In
   the disclosure, the combination of the end symbols and the subframe immediately prior
 5 to the last subframe may be referred as to a "super subframe".                  According to
   embodiments of the present invention, the predetermined threshold may be set as a
   fixed value, for example, 3 or a value that is changed dynamically.               It is to be
   understood that the above example embodiments are only for the purpose of illustration,
   without suggesting any limitations on the subject matter described herein.                The
10 predetermined threshold may be implemented in any other suitable ways.
    [0046] According to embodiments of the present invention, optionally, if the transmitter
   performs the method 100, the transmitter may determine a transport block size based on
   the number of end symbols and transmit data of the transport block size in the last
   subframe.     Details may be described with reference to FIG. 2.
15  [0047] According to embodiments of the present invention, optionally, if the receiver
   performs the method 100, the receiver may determine a transport block size based on
   the number of end symbols and receive data of the transport block size in the last
   subframe.     Details may be described with reference to FIG. 3.
    [0048] Reference is now made to FIG. 2, which illustrates a flow chart of a method 200
20 for performing fractional subframe transmission at a transmitter according to an
   embodiment of the invention.         The method 200 may be considered as a specific
   implementation of the method 100 described above with reference to Fig. 1 and
   performed by the transmitter.      However, it is noted that this is only for the purpose of
   illustrating the principles of the present invention, rather than limiting the scope thereof.
25 [0049] Method 200 begins at step S210, a symbol of a first subframe at which the
   channel becomes available is detennined.
   [0050] According to embodiments of the present invention, whether a channel is
   available may be detennined in several ways, such as energy detection, carrier sensing,
   and so on.    In some embodiments, strength of energy from a further transmitter may be
30 measured on the channel.        The further transmitter may be a transmitter that may use
   the same channel and is different from the transmitter performing the method according
                                                  10

   to embodiments of the present invention.      If the energy strength is not strong, it may be
   determined that the channel is idle.       In this regard, the energy strength may be
   compared with a strength threshold.      In response to that the measured strength is less
   than the strength threshold, the channel may be detennined as being available.           The
 5 strength threshold may be a predetermined threshold, which may be set according to
   system requirements, specifications, channel quality, and so on.               According to
   embodiments of the present invention, the strength threshold may be set as a fixed value
   or a value that is changed dynamically.     It is to be understood that the above example
   embodiments are only for the purpose of illustration, without suggesting any limitations
10 on the subject matter described herein.    The strength threshold may be implemented in
   any other suitable ways.
    [0051] Alternatively, the channel availability may be detected based on carrier sensing.
   By way of example, a signalling from a further transmitter may be detected on the
   channel.    The further transmitter may be a transmitter that may use the channel and is
15 different from the transmitter performing the method according to embodiments of the
   present invention.    Based on the signalling, whether the channel is available may be
   determined.     When the transmitter detect a channel becomes available at a symbol, the
   subframe comprising the symbol may be determined as the first subframe.
   [00521 It is to be noted although the above embodiments illustrate a further transmitter,
20 there may be a plurality of further transmitters in a communication system according to
   embodiments of the present invention.        In such embodiments, energy detection and
   carrier sensing may be performed with respect to the plurality of further transmitters.
   [0053] At step S220, the first temporal information is determined as comprising a
   potential position immediately prior to the symbol, wherein the potential position is
25 predefined in the first subframe.
   [0054] In an exemplary embodiment, if the symbol determined at step S210 is symbol 5,
   and there are three predefined potential positions corresponding to symbols 0, 7 and 11,
   respectively, the transmitter may determine that the potential position corresponding to
   symbol 0 is a potential position immediately prior to the current position.      As such, at
30 step S220, the first temporal information may comprise the potential position
   corresponding to symbol 0.
                                                 11

     [00551 It is to be noted that, in some alternative embodiments, the first temporal
    information may be determined as comprising an index of the symbol detennined at
    step S210.    By way of example, if the symbol determined at step S210 is symbol 5, the
    first temporal information may be detennined as comprising an index of symbol 5.       As
  5 can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the first temporal information may
    comprise an index of the symbol determined at step S210, a potential position
    immediately prior to the symbol, or any symbol between the symbol determined at step
    S210 and the potential position immediately prior to the symbol.     The above example
    embodiments are only for the purpose of illustration, without suggesting any limitations
10  on the subject matter described herein.
    [0056] At step S230, the number of symbols used by the fractional subframe
    transmission is determined based on the transmission opportunity information.
    [0057] In some embodiments, the transmission opportunity information may comprise
    channel occupancy time.      In an exemplary embodiment, the channel occupancy time
15  may be 3.5 ms, for example.      For a subframe of ims which includes M symbols, for
    example M=14, it may be determined that 1 symbol may occupy about 0.071 ins.           In
    view of the length of the channel occupancy time and the symbol, for example, by
    means of dividing the channel occupancy time by 0.071, the transmitter may determine
    that the number of symbols used by the fractional subframe transmission as 49.
20  [0058] At step S240, the number of end symbols is determined based on the first
    temporal information and the number of symbols used by the fractional subframe
    transmission, wherein the end symbols are used by the fractional subframe transmission
    and belong to a last subframe of the fractional subframe transmission.
    [0059] As discussed above, the first temporal infonnation may comprise the potential
25  position immediately prior to the symbol determined at step S210.              In some
    embodiments, the last symbol of the fractional subframe transmission may be
    determined as follows:
                                         Se  =  S1 + TXOP                                 (3)
    where S1 represents the potential position immediately prior to the symbol determined
30  at step S210, Se represents the index of the last symbol, and TXOP represents the
    channel occupancy time (for example, how many symbols).
                                                 12

    [0060i In an exemplary embodiment, SI is the first symbol (i.e., symbol 0) of the first
   subframe and TXOP is 49 symbols.        Thus, the last symbol may be determined as the
   49th symbol of the fractional subframe transmission.           If a subframe comprises M
   symbols, for example M=14, it may be determined that the fractional subframe
 5 transmission occupy 4 subframes, wherein the first three subframes are fully occupied
   and the first seven symbols (symbol 0 to 6) of the last subframe are occupied.
   According to embodiments of the present invention, the first seven symbols (symbol 0
   to 6) of the last subframe may be determined as ending symbols.         Accordingly, at step
   S240, it may be determined that the number of the ending symbols is 7.
10 [0061i At step S250, a transport block size is determined based on the number of end
   symbols.
   [0062i The transport block size indicates the size of a data block to be transmitted in the
   fractional subframe transmission.    According to embodiments of the present invention,
   the transport block size may be determined in various ways.          In some embodiments,
15 the end symbols of the last subframe may be considered as available symbols of a
   fractional subframe.    The transmitter may determine a scaling factor associated with
   the number of the available symbols, and then determine the transport block size based
   on the scaling factor.    The scaling factor may be defined in several ways.       Table 1
   illustrates an example of scaling factors associated with different numbers of available
20 symbols.

   [0063] In some embodiments, if the number of the available symbols is 1, 2 or 3, the
                                               13

   transmitter may use the available symbols to transmit control information of the
   fractional subframe transmission, and may determine that the available symbols are not
   enough for transmitting data after the transmission of the control information.       In this
   regard, the scaling factor may be designed as a value of "N/A", which indicates that the
 5 scaling factor is "not available".     In an exemplary embodiment, if the number of the
   available symbols is 4, the transmitter may determine that the associated scaling factor
   is 0.25.    In an exemplary embodiment, if the number of the available symbols is 5, the
   transmitter may determine that the associated scaling factor is 0.25 or 0.375.         In an
   exemplary embodiment, if the number of the available symbols is 6, the transmitter may
10 determine that the associated scaling factor is 0.375.      In an exemplary embodiment, if
   the number of the available symbols is 7, the transmitter may determine that the
   associated scaling factor is 0.375 or 0.5.     In an exemplary embodiment, if the number
   of the available symbols is 8, the transmitter may determine that the associated scaling
   factor is 0.5 or 0.75.     In an exemplary embodiment, if the number of the available
15 symbols is 9, 10, 11 or 12, the transmitter may determine that the associated scaling
   factor is 0.75.    In an exemplary embodiment, if the number of the available symbols is
   13 or 14, the transmitter may determine that the associated scaling factor is 1.
   [0064] In some embodiments, the transport block size may be determined based on the
   scaling factor in several ways.       By way of example, a first resource block number
20 which indicates a number of resource blocks allocated for transmission may be obtained.
   For the transmitter, the first resource block number may be determined by the
   transmitter in real time.     Then, a second resource block number may be determined
   based on the first resource block number and the scaling factor.          In an exemplary
   embodiment, the second resource block number may be determined as follows:
25                            NPRB = max [N'      x Factorj,                                 (4)
   wherein   N'PRB   represents the first resource block number, NPRB represents the second
   resource block number, Factorrepresents the scaling factor.
   10065] Based on the second resource block number, the transport block size may be
30 determined.      In some embodiments, a transport block size table may be used for
   determining the transport block size.      Table 2 illustrates an exemplary transport block
   size table.

   [0066] The horizontal direction of Table 2 may correspond to a resource block number,
   for example, the second resource block number in the embodiments, and the vertical
 5 direction may correspond to a Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS).                     In the
   embodiments, when the transmitter determines the second resource block number as
   well as the MCS that is employed currently, it may determine the transport block size by
   looking up the Table 2 based on the second resource block number and the MCS.             By
   way of example, if the second resource block number is 8, and the MCS is 8 the
10 transport block size may be determined as 1096.
   100671 It is to be noted that although the dimension of Table 2 is 10 X 27, it is
   simplification of 3GPP TS36.213 whose dimension is 34 X 110.             It is further to be
   noted that the above example table is only for the purpose of illustration, without
   suggesting any limitations on the subject matter described herein.       Any other suitable
15 table may be used in the determination of the transport block size.
   100681 At step S260, data of the transport block size is transmitted in the last subframe.

     [0069] In some embodiments, the transmitter may transmit other possible information,
    such as Reference        Signal (RS), Primary Synchronous Signal (PSS),            Secondary
     Synchronous Signal (SSS),        and so on in data region of the factional subframe
    transmission, for example, Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH), if necessary.
  5  [0070] Reference is now made to FIG. 3, which illustrates a flow chart of a method 300
    for performing fractional subframe transmission at a receiver according to an
    embodiment of the invention.          The method 300 may be considered as a specific
    implementation of the method 100 described above with reference to Fig. 1 and
    performed by the receiver.       However, it is noted that this is only for the purpose of
10  illustrating the principles of the present invention, rather than limiting the scope thereof.
    [00711 Method 300 begins at step S310, a symbol of a first subframe at which the
    channel becomes available is determined.
    [0072] In some embodiments, the transmitter may notify the receiver the first temporal
    information, for example, the index of the symbol of the first subframe at which a
15  channel becomes available.       In an exemplary embodiment, the transmitter may send an
    indicator regarding the first temporal information to the receiver.         In this way, the
    index of the symbol of the first subframe may be indicated explicitly.          Thus, at step
    S310, the receiver may determine the symbol of the first subframe by detecting the
    indicator.    In an alternative embodiment, the transmitter may not send the indicator,
20  and the receiver may make blind decoding for control information of the fractional
    subframe transmission at a potential position.     In response to that the blind decoding is
    success, the receiver may determine the symbol of a first subframe at which the channel
    becomes available.
    [0073] At step S320, the first temporal information is determined as comprising a
25  potential position immediately prior to the symbol, wherein the potential position is
    predefined in the first subframe.
    [0074] In an exemplary embodiment, if the symbol determined at step S320 is symbol 5,
    and there are three predefined potential positions corresponding to symbols 0, 7 and 11,
    respectively, the receiver may determine the potential position corresponding to symbol
30  0 is a potential position immediately prior to the current position.        As such, at step
    S320, the first temporal information may comprise the potential position corresponding
                                                  16

   to symbol 0.
    [0075] It is to be noted that, in some alternative embodiments, the first temporal
   information may be determined as comprising an index of the symbol determined at
   step S320.    By way of example, if the symbol determined at step S320 is symbol 5, the
 5 first temporal information may be determined as comprising an index of symbol 5. As
   can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the first temporal information may
   comprise an index of the symbol determined at step S320, a potential position
   immediately prior to the symbol, or any symbol between the symbol determined at step
   S320 and the potential position immediately prior to the symbol.       The above example
10 embodiments are only for the purpose of illustration, without suggesting any limitations
   on the subject matter described herein.
    [00761 At step S330, the number of symbols used by the fractional subframe
   transmission is determined based on the transmission opportunity information.
   [0077] In some embodiments, the transmission opportunity information may comprise
15 channel occupancy time.     In an exemplary embodiment, the channel occupancy time
   may be 3.5 ms, for example.     For a subframe of ims which includes M symbols, for
   example M=14, it may be determined that 1 symbol may occupy about 0.071 ms.              In
   view of the length of the channel occupancy time and the symbol, for example, by
   means of dividing the channel occupancy time by 0.071, the receiver may determine
20 that the number of symbols used by the fractional subframe transmission as 49.
   [0078] At step S340, the number of end symbols is determined based on the first
   temporal information and the number of symbols used by the fractional subframe
   transmission, wherein the end symbols are used by the fractional subframe transmission
   and belong to a last subframe of the fractional subframe transmission.
25 [0079] As discussed above, the first temporal information may comprise the potential
   position immediately prior to the symbol determined at step S310.                 In some
   embodiments, the receiver may determine the last symbol of the fractional subframe
   transmission according to equation (3), for example.
   [0080] At step S350, a transport block size is detennined based on the number of end
30 symbols.
   [0081] The transport block size indicates the size of a data block to be transmitted in the
                                                17

   fractional subframe transmission.     According to embodiments of the present invention,
   the transport block size may be detennined in various ways.         In some embodiments,
   the end symbols of the last subframe may be considered as available symbols of a
   fractional subframe.    The receiver may detennine a scaling factor associated with the
 5 number of the available symbols, and then determine the transport block size based on
   the scaling factor.  The scaling factor may be defined in several ways.       As discussed
   above, Table 1 illustrates an example of scaling factors associated with different
   numbers of available symbols.
   [0082] In an exemplary embodiment, if the number of the available symbols is 4, the
10 receiver may determine that the associated scaling factor is 0.25.        In an exemplary
   embodiment, if the number of the available symbols is 5, the receiver may determine
   that the associated scaling factor is 0.25 or 0.375.   In an exemplary embodiment, if the
   number of the available symbols is 6, the receiver may determine that the associated
   scaling factor is 0.375.   In an exemplary embodiment, if the number of the available
15 symbols is 7, the receiver may determine that the associated scaling factor is 0.375 or
   0.5.   In an exemplary embodiment, if the number of the available symbols is 8, the
   receiver may determine that the associated scaling factor is 0.5 or 0.75.            In an
   exemplary embodiment, if the number of the available symbols is 9, 10, 11 or 12, the
   receiver may determine that the associated scaling factor is 0.75.        In an exemplary
20 embodiment, if the number of the available symbols is 13 or 14, the receiver may
   determine that the associated scaling factor is 1.
   [0083] In some embodiments, the transport block size may be detennined based on the
   scaling factor in several ways.      By way of example, a first resource block number
   which indicates a number of resource blocks allocated for transmission may be obtained.
25 For the receiver, the first resource block number may be notified by the transmitter.
   Then, a second resource block number may be determined based on the first resource
   block number and the scaling factor.         In an exemplary embodiment, the second
   resource block number may be determined according to equation (4).           Based on the
   second resource block number, the transport block size may be determined.         In some
30 embodiments, a transport block size table, for example Table 2, may be used for
   determining the transport block size.       In particular, if the receiver detennines the
   second resource block number as well as the MCS which is employed currently, it may
                                                18

    determine the transport block size by looking up the Table 2.
     [0084] At step S360, data of the transport block size is received in the last subframe.
     [00851 In some embodiments, the receiver may receive other possible information,       such
    as Reference Signal (RS), Primary Synchronous Signal (PSS), Secondary Synchronous
  5 Signal (SSS), and so on in data region of the factional subframe transmission, for
    example, Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH), if necessary.
    [00861 FIG. 4 illustrates a schematic diagram 400 of fractional subframe transmission
    according to embodiments of the invention.      FIG. 4 exemplarily shows four subframes,
    subframes 0 to 3.    With respect to subframe 0, there are three potential positions 421,
10  422 and 423, wherein the first potential position 421 corresponds to the start of
    subframe 0, for example, symbol 0 of subframe 0.       CCA/eCCA 401 may start from the
    first potential position 421.      During the CCA/eCCA 401, the transmitter may
    determine that the channel is available at a position 424.     Since the position 424 is not
    a potential position, the transmitter may transmit channel occupation signals from the
15  position 424 until a potential position, for example, the potential position 422, and
    determine the potential position 422 as the target position.       The factional subframe
    transmission then may start from the target position, wherein control information may
    be transmitted on Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) at time periods 403,
    405, 407 and 409, and data may be transmitted on PDSCH at time periods 404, 406, 408
20  and 410.    As shown, the factional subframe transmission ends at a position 425.
    [00871 As shown in FIG. 4, the symbol of a first subframe at which the channel
    becomes available may be determined as a symbol corresponding to the position 424.
    Since the potential position immediately prior to the determined symbol is the potential
    position 421, it may be determined that the channel occupation time starts at the
25  potential position 421.   Assuming the transmission opportunity information comprises
    TXOP of 3.5 ms, it may be determined that the number of symbols used by the
    fractional subframe transmission is 49.         As illustrated by FIG 5, the TXOP
    corresponds to a time period from the position 421 to the position 425, and the actual
    channel occupation time is from the position 424 to the position 425.           Thus, a time
30  period from the position 421 to the position 424 is not occupied.       Then, based on the
    potential position 421 and the number of symbols used by the fractional subframe
                                                 19

   transmission, the end symbols may be determined as the first seven symbols of
   subframe 3, and the number of the end symbols is 7.          In this way, the end of the
   fractional subframe transmission can be estimated.
    [0088] According to embodiments of the present invention, optionally, the method 200
 5 or 300 may further comprise a step of comparing the number of end symbols with a
   predetermined threshold.     Responsive to that the number of end symbols is less than or
   equal to a predetermined threshold, the last subframe may be released.             In an
   alternative embodiment, responsive to that the number of end symbols is less than or
   equal to a predetermined threshold, the end symbols may be combined with a subframe
10 immediately prior to the last subframe as a super subframe.        The super subframe is
   exemplarily shown in FIG. 5, which illustrates a schematic diagram 500 of fractional
   subframe transmission according to embodiments of the invention.       As shown in FIG.
   5, there are four subframes, subframe 0 to 3.    Since the number of end symbols of the
   last subframe (subframe 3) is less than the predetermined threshold, for example, 3, the
15 end symbols may be combined with subframe 2 as a super subframe.           As shown, the
   super subframe may correspond to a time period from the start of subframe 2 501 to the
   last one of the end symbols 502.
