TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002] The technology described herein relates generally to a laser treatment device and more
particularly to a replaceable handpiece assembly for delivering electromagnetic energy to a
target surface.
BACKGROUND
[0003] Electromagnetic energy devices are employed m a variety of applications. For example,
a simple incandescent light may be used to illuminate an area with electromagnetic energy in a
form of visible light. Another form of electromagnetic energy, such as a laser beam, may be
used to illuminate an area, to identify a target, or to deliver concentrated energy to a target in
order to perform various procedures such as melting, cutting, or the like. Certain medical
devices may deliver electromagnetic energy to a target surface such as, for example, an eye, in
order to correct a deficiency in visual acuity. Other medical devices may direct electromagnetic
energy toward a surface of a tooth to perform, for example, a cutting or whitening operation.
Endoscopic devices can be used to enhance visualization of internal parts of, for example, a
human body in order to detect or remove diseased tissue.
SUMMARY
[0004] A handpiece assembly for laser treating a target surface and a laser system are disclosed.
A handpiece assembly for laser treating a target surface includes a cable connector that is

                                                 2
detachably coupled to a power supply and control module. The cable connector is configured to
receive power and control signals from the power supply and control module. The handpiece
assembly also includes a laser module configured to receive the power and control signals from
the cable connector and to generate electromagnetic energy based on the received power and
control signals. The laser module is a replaceable module that is detachably coupled to the cable
connector and a handpiece to allow the laser module to be removed from the handpiece
assembly. The replaceable module allows a particular laser module to be removed from the
handpiece assembly and replaced with another laser module. The handpiece assembly further
includes the handpiece configured to receive the electromagnetic energy from the laser module
and to direct the electromagnetic energy to the target surface through a replaceable tip
attachment.
[0005] In another example, a laser system includes a power supply and control module
configured to provide power and control signals to a handpiece assembly. The power supply and
control module is detachably coupled to the handpiece assembly via a cable. The laser system
further includes a handpiece assembly, where the handpiece assembly includes a cable
connector that is detachably coupled to the power supply and control module via the cable. The
cable connector is configured to receive the power and control signals from the power supply
and control module. The handpiece assembly also includes a laser module configured to receive
the power and control signals from the cable connector and to generate electromagnetic energy
based on the received power and control signals. The handpiece assembly further includes a
handpiece configured to receive the electromagnetic energy from the laser module and to direct
the electromagnetic energy to a target surface.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0013] Fig. 1 depicts an example laser system 100 including a power supply and control module
102 included in a dental chair 120 and a handpiece assembly 104 connected to the power supply
and control module 102. In the example laser system 100, the power supply and control module
102 is used to provide power and control signals to the handpiece assembly 104 via a cable 106.
For example, the power provided by the power supply and control system 102 may include a
DC voltage that is used to provide a driving current to a laser module 110 included in the
handpiece assembly 104. The control signals provided by the power supply and control module
102 to the handpiece assembly 104 include various electronic signals for controlling operation
of the laser module 110. For example, the control signals may be used to tum the laser module
110 on, shut the laser module 110 off, control a maximum output power that can be provided by
the laser module 110, or to control various other aspects of the handpiece assembly 104. The
power supply and control module 102 is mounted inside or on an instrument terminal of the
dental chair 120.
[0014] The handpiece assembly 104 includes a cable connector 108, the laser module 110, a
handpiece 114, and a tip 115. The cable connector 108 is detachably coupled to the power
supply and control module 102 via the cable 106 and is used to receive the power and control

                                                   4
signals from the power supply and control module 102. The cable connector 108 thus includes
the necessary connections to receive the power and control signals and to thereafter distribute
the received power and control signals to other portions of the handpiece assembly 104. It is
noted that although the example illustration of Fig. 1 depicts the cable connector 108 as being
separate from the handpiece assembly 104, in other examples, the cable connector 108 is
integrated within the handpiece assembly 104 and is considered a part of the handpiece
assembly in such other examples.
[0015] The laser module 110 of the handpiece assembly 104 is connected to the cable connector
108 and is configured to receive the power and control signals from the cable connector 108.
Based on the received power and control signals, the laser module 110 generates
electromagnetic energy 112 (e.g., laser light). The laser module 110 may be, for example, a laser
diode, a diode-pumped solid state laser, a flashlamp-pumped solid state laser, a light emitting
diode, or another type of light-generating component. The handpiece 114 receives the
electromagnetic energy 112 from the laser module 110 and directs the electromagnetic energy
112 to a target surface 118. In the example of Fig. 1, the target surface may be an area of a
dental patient's mouth (e.g., teeth, gums, etc.). The handpiece 114 is application-specific and
may thus include a geometry or optics (e.g., lenses, etc.) that are specific for a particular clinical
application. In directing the electromagnetic energy 112 to the target surface 118, the tip 115 is
used. The tip 115 receives the electromagnetic energy 112 from the handpiece 114 and may
include fiber optic materials, sapphire, or other optical materials. Further, the tip 115 may be
shaped to be optimized for a particular clinical application.
[0016] As described above, the handpiece assembly 104 includes the cable connector 108 that is
detachably coupled to the power supply and control module 102 and is used to receive the
power and control signals from the power supply and control module 102. The cable connector
108 is designed to match a cable connector 122 included on the dental chair 120, such that
various signals and substances are transported between the dental chair 120 and handpiece
assembly 104 over the cable 106. As illustrated at 124, the signals and substances transported
over the cable 106 include the aforementioned power and control signals and also include
pressurized air, water or another liquid, a feedback signal, and a unique identifier.
[0017] The cable 106 includes the connections necessary to allow communication in both
directions between the dental chair 120 and the handpiece assembly 104. Thus, communications

                                                    5
from the dental chair 120 to the handpiece assembly 104 include the power and control signals
that are received at the cable connector 108 and used by the laser module 110 in generating the
electromagnetic energy 112. The cable 106 also includes an air channel or a water channel for
delivering the pressurized air or water from the dental chair 120 to the handpiece assembly 104.
[0018] The pressurized air or water is used at the handpiece assembly 104 to cool the laser
module 110 or to provide an air or water spray at or around the target surface 118.
[0019] Communications from the handpiece assembly 104 to the dental chair 120 include the
aforementioned feedback signal. The feedback signal includes various operation conditions of
the laser module 110, which may indicate, for example, an output power of the laser module
110, a temperature of the laser module 110, or a presence of other signals for diagnostic
applications. In one example, the handpiece assembly 104 includes a microprocessor with
instructions for controlling output parameters of the laser module 110 (e.g., controlling an
output power of the laser module 110) and for monitoring operation conditions of the laser
module 110. The instructions of the microprocessor are received from the power supply and
control module 102 via the cable 106. In examples where the microprocessor is included in the
handpiece assembly 104, the feedback signal includes various operation conditions of the laser
module 110 that are monitored by the microprocessor.
[0020] Communications from the handpiece assembly 104 to the dental chair 120 also include
the aforementioned unique identifier. In an example, the laser module 110 includes a unique
electronic identifier. The electronic identifier includes information about the type of laser
included in the laser module 110 and calibration parameters of the laser module 110. By
transmitting the unique identifier for the laser module 110 to the power supply and control
module 102, safeguards are triggered within the power supply and control module 102 to protect
the laser module 110. For example, the unique identifier is used to indicate a maximum driving
current that may be received by the laser module 110, such that the power supply and control
module 102 can constrain the driving current supplied based on this value. Further, the unique
identifier is used generally for identification of the laser module 110 by the dental chair 120 or
the power supply and control module 102.
[0021] Conventionally, laser systems for dental or medical applications include laser modules
positioned in one of two typical configurations. In a first typical configuration, the laser module

                                                   6
is positioned in a system housing. In this configuration, both the power supply and control
module and the laser module are included in the system housing, and a delivery system is used
for delivering electromagnetic energy from the system housing to a delivery device. For
example, in the first typical configuration, the electromagnetic energy is generated in the
housing, and a fiber cable is used to deliver the generated electromagnetic energy to a handpiece
assembly. In a second typical configuration, the laser module is included in a handpiece
assembly, where the handpiece assembly also includes a power supply and control module.
Thus, in the second typical configuration, all portions of the laser system (e.g., a battery to be
used as a power supply, necessary controls, and the laser module used to generate the
electromagnetic energy based on the current supplied by the battery) are integrated within the
single handpiece assembly.
[0022] By contrast, the laser system 100 utilizes a hybrid configuration that differs from both of
the typical configurations described above. In the hybrid configuration, the power supply and
control module 102 is physically separated from the laser module 110. As described above, the
handpiece assembly 104 including the laser module 110 is separate and distinct from the power
supply and control module 102, such that the power supply and control module 102 is not
integrated within the handpiece assembly 104. Thus, in the laser system 100, the power supply
and control module 102 is separated from both of the handpiece assembly 104 and laser module
110. Further, in the example laser system 100 of Fig. 1, the cable 106 does not include a fiber
cable, such that the laser system 100 differs from embodiments of the first typical configuration
that use a fiber cable as a delivery system. In an example of the laser system 100, no fiber cables
are used in any portion of the system 100.
[0023] In the hybrid configuration of the laser system 100, the handpiece assembly 104
(including the cable connector 108, the laser module 110, and the handpiece 114) is a
replaceable, interchangeable module. The replaceable, interchangeable nature of the handpiece
assembly 104 allows a particular handpiece assembly to be disconnected from the system 100
and replaced with another handpiece assembly without requiring replacement of the power
supply and control module 102. The replaceable, interchangeable nature of the handpiece
assembly 104 is facilitated by the cable connector 108 of the handpiece assembly 104, which
allows the handpiece assembly 104 to be detachably coupled to the power supply and control
module 102. The detachable coupling allows the handpiece assembly 104 to be disconnected
easily from the power supply and control module 102. Specifically, in an example, the

                                                    7
handpiece assembly 104 is disconnected from the power supply and control module 102 by
disconnecting the cable 106 from the power supply and control module 102.
[0024] To further facilitate the replaceable, interchangeable nature of the handpiece assembly
104, the laser system 100 of Fig. 1 utilizes standardized connectors for the connectors 108, 122.
In this manner, any handpiece assembly 104 including the proper standardized connector can be
swapped into and out of the laser system 100, thus allowing handpiece assemblies with different
parameters (e.g., handpiece assemblys configured to generate electromagnetic energy 112 of
different wavelengths) to be easily connected and disconnected from the system 100. The
standardized connectors between the handpiece assembly 104 and the dental chair 120 also
prevent operation of unknown or unauthorized devices within the system 100. For example, the
standardized connectors may have a unique design to ensure that unauthorized or noncompliant
instruments or laser modules cannot be connected to the system 100.
[0025] Figs. 2A and 2B depict an example handpiece assembly including a cable connector 202,
a laser module 206, a handpiece 208, and a tip 209. In Fig. 2A, the constituent pieces 202, 206,
208, 209 of the handpiece assembly are disassembled, and in Fig. 2B, the constituent pieces 202,
206, 208, 209 are connected to each other to form a single handpiece assembly unit. The cable
connector 202 is detachably connected to a power supply and control module via a cable 204
(e.g., as illustrated in the example laser system 100 of Fig. 1 ). The cable connector 202 is used
to receive power and control signals from the power supply and control module. The laser
module 206 is connected to the cable connector 202 and is used to receive the power and control
signals from the cable connector 202. Based on the power and control signals, the laser module
206 generates electromagnetic energy. The handpiece 208 is connected to the laser module 206
and receives the electromagnetic energy from the laser module 206. The handpiece 208 is used
to direct the electromagnetic energy to a target surface (e.g., a tissue surface or other part of a
human body). In directing the electromagnetic energy to the target surface, the electromagnetic
energy is passed through the tip 209, which may have a geometry that is optimized for a
particular clinical application.
[0026] In Figs. 2A and 2B, the cable 204 includes air and water channels and electrical
connections for delivering pressurized air, water, and the power and control signals. The laser
module 206 may include a laser diode, a diode-pumped solid state laser, a flashlamp-pumped
solid state laser, or a light emitting diode. The laser module 206 generates electromagnetic

                                                  8
energy at a wavelength in the range of approximately 400 nm to 3.0 )lm and with an average
power in a range of approximately 0.1 W to 20 W. The laser module 206 operates in a
continuous-wave (CW) mode or a pulsed operation mode.
[0027] In one example, the handpiece 208 is a rotatable handpiece that is designed for a specific
application. The handpiece 208 may include optical elements (e.g., a lens, mirror, filter,
beamsplitter, prism, grating, etc.) or the handpiece may have no permanent optics. The
handpiece 208 may be autoclavable, or the handpiece 208 may be disinfected with a disinfecting
solution or used with a sterile sleeve or cover.
[0028] Fig. 3 depicts an example laser system 300 including a variety of interchangeable laser
modules 306A, 306B, 306C and a variety of interchangeable handpieces 308A, 308B, 308C. In
the example laser system 300, a power supply and control module 310 is used to provide power
and control signals to a handpiece assembly 305 via a cable 304. The handpiece assembly 305
includes a cable connector 302, a laser module 306, a handpiece 308, and a tip 309. The cable
connector 302 is detachably coupled to the power supply and control module 310 via the cable
304 and is used to receive the power and control signals from the power supply and control
module 310. The cable connector 302 matches a cable connector 312 of the power supply and
control module 310. The laser module 306 of the handpiece assembly 305 receives the power
and control signals from the cable connector 302 and generates electromagnetic energy, and the
handpiece 308 receives the electromagnetic energy from the laser module 306. Because the
power supply and control module 310 may be included within a dental chair, the laser system
300 further includes an optional footswitch 318. The footswitch 318 is used, for example, to
actuate the laser output of the laser module 306.
[0029] The handpiece assembly 305 is a replaceable, interchangeable module. The replaceable,
interchangeable nature of the handpiece assembly 305 allows a particular handpiece assembly to
be disconnected from the system 300 and replaced with another handpiece assembly without
requiring replacement of the power supply and control module 310. In a similar manner, both
the laser module 306 and the handpiece 308 are also replaceable and interchangeable. The laser
module 306 is detachably coupled to the cable connector 302 and to the handpiece 308. The
detachable coupling between the laser module 306 and the cable connector 302 and the
handpiece 308 allows the laser module 306 to be easily removed from the handpiece assembly
305. Further, due to the replaceable nature of the laser module 306, a particular laser module can

                                                    9
be removed from the handpiece assembly 305 and replaced with another laser module without
requiring replacement of any other components of the system 300 (e.g., without requiring
replacement of the cable connector 302, the handpiece 308, or the power supply and control
module 31 0).
[0030] The replaceable nature of the laser module 306 is highlighted in Fig. 3, which illustrates
the variety of interchangeable laser modules 306A, 306B, 306C. The different laser modules
306A, 306B, 306C in the example of Fig. 3 each generate electromagnetic energy at a different
wavelength. For example, the laser module 306A generates electromagnetic energy at a
wavelength of 940 nm, the laser module 306B generates electromagnetic energy at a wavelength
of 810 nm, and the laser module 306C generates electromagnetic energy at a wavelength of 660
nm. In a similar manner, the laser module 306 may be configured to work with different,
interchangeable laser modules that utilize different laser types. For example, the interchangeable
laser modules may include a laser module that utilizes a laser diode, a laser module that utilizes
a diode-pumped solid state laser, a laser module that utilizes a flashlamp-pumped solid state
laser, or a laser module that utilizes a light emitting diode.
[0031] As noted above, the handpiece 308 is also a replaceable and interchangeable module.
The handpiece 308 is detachably coupled to the laser module 306. The detachable coupling
between the handpiece 308 and the laser module 306 allows the handpiece 308 to be easily
removed from the handpiece assembly 305. Further, due to the replaceable nature of the
handpiece 308, a particular handpiece can be removed from the handpiece assembly 305 and
replaced with another handpiece without requiring replacement of any other components of the
system 300 (e.g., without requiring replacement of the cable connector 302, the laser module
306, or the power supply and control module 31 0).
[0032] The replaceable nature ofthe handpiece 308 is highlighted in Fig. 3, which illustrates the
variety of interchangeable handpieces 308A, 308B, 308C. The different handpieces 308A,
308B, 308C in the example of Fig. 3 are each adapted for different clinical operations. For
example, the handpiece 308A is adapted for performing surgery, the handpiece 308B is adapted
for whitening teeth, and the handpiece 308C is adapted for a pain therapy clinical operation. The
interchangeable handpieces 308A, 308B, 308C may also have different geometries, different
optics, and other varying properties. As illustrated in Fig. 3, certain of the interchangeable laser
modules 306A, 306B, 306C are usable with only certain of the interchangeable handpieces

                                                 10
308A, 308B, 308C, and vice versa. For example, although the laser module 306A is usable with
each of the three handpieces 308A, 308B, 308C, the laser module 306C is usable with only the
handpiece 308C. In other examples, however, all laser modules 306A, 306B, 306C are usable
with all handpieces 308A, 308B, 308C, and vice versa. In the example of Fig. 3, the surgical
handpiece 308A uses the replaceable tip 309. The whitening handpiece 308B and the pain
control handpiece 308C do not use a tip but may use disposable protective covers.
[0033] The replaceable and interchangeable handpiece assembly 305, laser module 306, and
handpiece 308 facilitate economical upgrading of the laser system 300. For example, a new laser
module can replace a failing, old laser module, and this replacement does not require
replacement of other components of the system 300.
[0034] Fig. 4 depicts an example laser system 400 for use with a dental chair 401. In the
example laser system 400, a power supply and control module is integrated within a portion of
the dental chair 401. A handpiece assembly 406 includes a cable connector 410, interchangeable
laser modules 412, 414, 416, 418, and interchangeable handpieces 420, 422, 424, 426. The cable
connector 410 is detachably coupled to the power supply and control module via the cable 408
and is used to receive power and control signals from the power supply and control module. The
cable 408 includes an air channel or a water channel for delivering pressurized air or water from
the dental chair 401 to the handpiece assembly 406. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the dental chair 401
includes a footswitch 403, which is used to actuate the laser output of the handpiece assembly
406.
[0035] The dental chair 401 further includes instrument terminals 402, 404. The instrument
terminals 402, 404 are used to hold the handpiece assembly 406 when the handpiece assembly
406 is not in use. A sensor signal from one or both of the instrument terminals 402, 404
indicates whether the handpiece assembly 406 is within a holder included on the instrument
terminal 402 or 404. The sensor signal is used in one example to automatically switch the laser
system 400 between "standby" and "ready" modes, and a signal from the footswitch 403 may be
used to actuate the laser output of the handpiece assembly 406 when the laser system 400 is in
the "ready" mode. The dental chair 401 further includes a user interface that is configured to
read a signal from the power supply and control module. The user interface is used to generate a
display that indicates when the handpiece assembly 406 has been removed from the instrument
terminals 402, 404.

                                                   11
[0036] The dental chair 401 includes wireless communication circuitry 430. For example, the
power supply and control module includes the wireless communication circuitry 430, and the
wireless communication circuitry 430 is used to receive a signal from a wireless remote control
428 or to communicate with a network. The wireless remote control 428 is used to actuate the
laser output of the handpiece assembly 406, send various control signals from the power supply
and control module to the handpiece assembly 406, or otherwise control one or more operations
of the handpiece assembly 406. The wireless remote control 428 is, in an example, a smartphone
or a tablet computer (e.g., running the Android operating system or the Apple iOS operating
system) that is able to communicate in a wireless manner with the wireless communication
circuitry 430. Although the wireless connection capabilities of the remote control 428 are
described above, in other examples, the remote control 428 is a wired controller, such that the
remote control428 communicates with the dental chair 401 or the handpiece assembly 406 via a
wired connection.
[0037] The handpiece assembly 406 is a replaceable, interchangeable module. Similarly, the
laser module and the handpiece included within the handpiece assembly 406 are also replaceable
and interchangeable, such that both the laser module and the handpiece can be easily removed
from the handpiece assembly 406 and replaced with another compatible laser module and
handpiece, respectively. The replaceable nature of the laser module is highlighted in Fig. 4,
which illustrates the variety of interchangeable laser modules 412, 414, 416, 418. The different
laser modules 412, 414, 416, 418 each generate electromagnetic energy at a different
wavelength and are adapted for different clinical operations. For example, the laser module 412
generates blue laser light that is useful for cancer detection and curing of dental composite
materials; the laser module 414 generates red laser light that is useful for photoradiation therapy
or photodynamic therapy (PDT); the laser module 416 generates laser light at 940 nm that is
useful for pain therapy, teeth whitening, and surgery applications; and the laser module 418
generates laser light at 810 nm that is useful for biostimulation applications.
[0038] The handpiece is also a replaceable and interchangeable module. The replaceable nature
of the handpiece is highlighted in Fig. 4, which illustrates the variety of interchangeable
handpieces 420, 422, 424, and 426. The different handpieces 420, 422, 424, 426 are application
specific, such that they are adapted for different clinical operations. For example, the handpiece
420 is used with the laser module 412 for cancer detection and curing of dental composite
materials; the handpiece 422 is used with the laser module 414 for performing photoradiation

                                                 12
therapy or photodynamic therapy (PDT); the handpiece 424 is used with the laser module 416 or
the laser module 418 and is adapted for performing clinical operations at the wavelength ranges
of the modules 416, 418; and the handpiece 426 is used with the laser module 416 or the laser
module 418 and is adapted for performing clinical operations at the wavelength ranges of the
modules 416, 418.
[0039] Fig. 5 depicts example cable connectors 502, 504, 508 that are used in connecting a
power supply and control module, a handpiece assembly, and a laser module included in the
handpiece assembly. The handpiece assembly includes the cable connector 504, and the cable
connector 504 is detachably coupled to the cable connector 502 of the power supply and control
module via a cable 506. The cable connector 504 is used to receive power and control signals
from the power supply and control module. The cable connector 504 thus includes the necessary
connections to receive the power and control signals and to thereafter distribute the received
power and control signals to other portions of the handpiece assembly.
[0040] The cable connector 504 of the handpiece assembly is designed to match the cable
connector 502 of the power supply and control module. With the matching connectors 502, 504,
various signals and substances are transported between the power supply and control module (or
a dental chair that houses the power supply and control module) and the handpiece assembly.
The connectors 502, 504 are standardized connectors, and any handpiece assembly including the
proper standardized connector can be swapped into and out of the system. This allows handpiece
assemblies with different parameters to be easily connected and disconnected from the system.
The standardized connectors 502, 504 also prevent operation of unknown or unauthorized
devices within the system.
[0041] As illustrated in Fig. 5, the standardized connectors 502, 504 include connections or
channels for transferring a laser power control signal ("Power"), air intake and output ("Air IN"
and "Air OUT"), an identification code signal ("ID"), a signal from a thermistor ("Thermistor"),
a signal from a photodiode ("Photodiode"), a signal from a light emitting diode ("LED"), and an
aiming beam ("Aiming"). The signal from the thermistor is provided from a thermistor included
within or near the laser module. The signal from the thermistor is an example of a feedback
signal that is transmitted from the handpiece assembly to the power supply and control module.
The signal from the photodiode is provided from a photodiode included within or near the laser
module. The signal from the photodiode is another feedback signal used to indicate an output

                                                  13
power of the laser module. Similarly, the identification code signal is a feedback signal sent
from the laser module to the power supply and control module and is used to identify the laser
module included in the handpiece assembly. In contrast to the aforementioned feedback signals,
[0042] the aiming beam is transmitted from the power supply and control module to the
handpiece assembly. The aiming beam is a visible light beam that may be used in aiming the
output of the laser module. The signal from the light emitting diode is also transmitted from the
power supply and control module to the handpiece assembly and may be used to indicate that
the system is in a "ready" mode (e.g., the signal may tum on LEDs at the handpiece assembly
and the power supply and control module to indicate the "ready" mode).
[0043] The cable 506 includes integrated electrical and air lines to ensure flexibility of a user's
movements (e.g., to ensure flexibility of a dentist's movements within an operating area). The
cable connector 504 of the handpiece assembly also matches the connector 508 of the laser
module, such that the aforementioned signals and substances (e.g., the signal from the
thermistor, the signal from the photodiode, the aiming beam, the identification code signal, the
laser power control signal, and the air intake and output) can be transferred between the laser
module and the cable connector 504 of the handpiece assembly.
[0044] Fig. 6 depicts an example laser system 600 illustrating exemplary connections between
an instrument panel 604 of a dental chair 602, a power supply and control module 608, and a
handpiece assembly 615. In Fig. 6, cable connectors 614, 616, 620 of the power supply and
control module 608, the handpiece assembly 615, and the laser module, respectively, are similar
to those described above with reference to Fig. 5. The cable connector 616 of the handpiece
assembly 615 is designed to match the cable connector 614 of the power supply and control
module 608. With the matching connectors 614, 616, various signals and substances are
transported between the power supply and control module 608 and the handpiece assembly 615.
Specifically, the connectors 614, 616 include connections or channels for transferring a laser
power control signal, air intake and output, an identification code signal, a signal from a
thermistor, a signal from a photodiode, a signal from a light emitting diode, and an aiming
beam. These signals and substances are transferred over the cable 618. The cable connector 616
of the handpiece assembly 615 also matches the connector 620 of the laser module. As
illustrated in Fig. 6, the instrument panel 604 of the dental chair 602 is used to provide the air
intake and output to the cable connector 614.

                                                   14
[0045] The power supply and control module 608 includes connections for connecting to the
cable connector 614 and is thus configured to transmit the laser power control signal, the signal
from the light emitting diode, and the aiming beam and to receive the identification code signal,
the signal from the thermistor, and the signal from the photodiode. The power supply and
control module 608 is also connected to the instrument panel 604, a footswitch 606, and a
remote control 612. The instrument panel 604 of the dental chair 602 provides a DC supply
voltage and a sensor output to the power supply and control module 608. The DC supply voltage
is used by the power supply and control module 608 to provide a driving current to the laser
module included in the handpiece assembly 615. The sensor output indicates whether the
handpiece assembly 615 is within a holder included on the dental chair 602, and the sensor
output is used in one example to automatically switch the laser system 600 between "standby"
and "ready" modes.
[0046] The footswitch 606 provides a signal to the power supply and control module 608, where
the signal is used to actuate the laser output of the handpiece assembly 615 when the laser
system 600 is in the "ready" mode. The remote control 612 also provides a signal to the power
supply and control module 608. Although the remote control612 is depicted as being connected
to the power supply and control module 608 via a wired connection, the remote control 612 may
[0047] also be connected to the power supply and control module 608 via a wireless connection.
For example, the power supply and control module 608 includes an antenna 610 for facilitating
wireless communications with the remote control612. The remote control 612 is used to actuate
the laser output of the handpiece assembly 615, cause various control signals to be sent from the
power supply and control module 608 to the handpiece assembly 615, or otherwise control one
or more operations of the handpiece assembly 615.
