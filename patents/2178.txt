   herein.
   Field of the Invention
20      The present invention relates to a gaming system, a
   gaming controller, and a prize triggering method.
   Background of the Invention
25      It  is known to provide a gaming system which
   comprises a game controller arranged to randomly display
   several symbols   from a predetermined set of      symbols and to
   determine a game outcome such as a game win based on the
   displayed symbols.    Such gaming systems may commonly be
30 implemented as a stepper machine provided with reels with
   each reel carrying several symbols of the set,             or a video
   machine wherein selected symbols are displayed on virtual
   reels on a graphical display device.    Win outcomes can
   occur based on symbols appearing in one or more horizontal
35 lines,  diagonal lines, or any other predetermined way.
        Many venues employ jackpot controllers for awarding
                                              7650468_1 (GHMatters) P74416.AU.4 LIENM 14/02/2013

                               - 2
   jackpots to one or more gaming machines participating in
   the jackpot.  Typically, a portion of turnover received
   during game play, from each gaming machine, is forwarded
   to a jackpot controller as a contribution.        That is, part
 5 of each wager goes towards the jackpot.   The technique can
   be implemented within a single gaming machine or may be
   extended to a so called wide area jackpot where multiple
   gaming machines  (from one or more different venues)
   contribute to a single jackpot pool.
10
        One way of awarding a jackpot is a so called "symbol
   driven" jackpot, where a predetermined symbol pattern or
   win outcome triggers the jackpot.
15      There is a need for an alternative technique for
   determining prizes  for win outcomes to a player.

   gaming machine 100.   The input/output interface 105 and/or
 5 the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with
   their own memory for storing associated instructions and
   data for use with the input/output interface or the
   peripheral devices.   A random number generator module 113
   generates random numbers  for use by the processor 102.
10 Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the
   reference to random numbers includes pseudo-random
   numbers.
        In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface
15 120 includes peripheral devices that communicate with the
   game controller 101 comprise one or more displays                     106, a
   touch screen and/or buttons 107,     a card and/or ticket
   reader 108,  a printer 109,   a bill acceptor and/or coin
   input mechanism 110 and a coin output mechanism 111.
20 Additional hardware may be included as part of the gaming
   machine 100,  or hardware may be omitted as required for
   the specific implementation.
        In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
25 communications interface,   for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example,     send status
   information, accounting information or other information
   to a central controller, server or database and receive
   data or commands from the central controller, server or
30 database.
        Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components
   of an exemplary memory 103.      The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                      The RAM
35 103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                      The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
                                                7650468_1 (GHMatters) P74416.AU.4 LIENM 14/02/2013

   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code    from the EPROM 103B
 5 or elsewhere.
        It is also possible for the operative components of
   the gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
10 provided remotely from the game controller 101.
        Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with
   an alternative embodiment.    The gaming system 200 includes
   a network 201,  which for example may be an Ethernet
15 network.  Gaming machines 202,    shown arranged in three
   banks 203 of two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are
   connected to the network 201.     The gaming machines 202
   provide a player operable interface and may be the same as
   the gaming machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or
20 may have simplified functionality depending on the
   requirements for implementing game play.      While banks 203
   of two gaming machines are illustrated in Figure                   5, banks
   of one, three or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
25      One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.   The displays 204 may, for example, be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
30 and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
        In a thick client embodiment, game server 205
   implements part of the game played by a player using a
35 gaming machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 implements
   part of the game.   With this embodiment, as both the game
   server and the gaming device implement part of the game,
                                               7650468_1 (GHMatters) P74416.AU.4 LIENM 14/02/2013

   they collectively provide a game controller.           A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A.   Typically, if the
 5 gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to carry out
   the accounting in respect of the Jackpot game.              A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
10      In a thin client embodiment, game server 205
   implements most or all of the game played by a player
   using a gaming machine 202 and the gaming machine 202
   essentially provides only the player interface.                  With this
   embodiment, the game server 205 provides the game
15 controller.  The gaming machine will receive player
   instructions, pass these to the game server which will
   process them and return game play outcomes to the gaming
   machine for display.  In a thin client embodiment, the
   gaming machines could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs
20 running software that provides a player interface operable
   using standard computer input and output components.
        Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200,    including for
25 example a gaming floor management  server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
30
        The gaming network 200 may communicate with other
   gaming systems, other local networks, for example a
   corporate network, and/or a wide area network such as the
   Internet, for example through a firewall 211.

        Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques,  functionality at the
                                             7650468_1 (GHMatters) P74416.AU.4 LIENM 14/02/2013

                                 - 16
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.      For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one     server or a
   separate server may be provided.      For example, the game
 5 server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.     Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of games servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
10 may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
        Embodiments may be implemented in relation to a
   spinning reel type game. Gaming systems     for implementing
15 games that involve a display of spinning reels as part of
   the display of the outcome of a game have either a video
   display or a mechanical display, these later machines most
   usually being "stepper" machines which have a separate
   motor for each reel. However, persons skilled in the art
20 will appreciate that the invention can be implemented in
   respect of other forms of games, including;          card games;
   ball draw games;   dice games;   and pin and ball games.
        In some implementations the game controllers of such
25 gaming machines select symbols by employing a stop
   determining function that randomly determines the stop
   position for each reel.     For example, if there are five
   reels, each having twenty symbols, the stop determining
   function might determine that the stop positions are
30 positions: 3,  13,  7,  9 and 17.   The spinning of the reels
   is then controlled so that each symbol comes to a stop in
   the same row, typically a predetermined row in a "window"
   visible to the player on the display that corresponds to a
   player playing a single win line.      When a reel stops, the
35 symbols will be in one of a plurality of possible symbol
   positions for that reel relative to the stop position.
                                                7650468_1 (GHMatters) P74416.AU.4 LIENM 14/02/2013

                                - 17
         Spinning reel type games typically allow a player to
    select how many win lines of a plurality of win lines they
    will play in each game -  i.e. a minimum of one win line up
    to the maximum number of win lines allowed by the game.
  5 Persons,  skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
    embodiments, the player may select a number of reels to
    play. Each win line is formed by a set of symbol positions
    consisting of one symbol position from each reel.                       That
    is, a predetermined symbol position of each reel is
10  assigned to a win line.   The  symbol positions that
    constitute each of the win lines are usually advertised to
    the player by markings on the display or diagrams                    showing
    the symbol positions that correspond to each win line.
    Some of the win lines will be horizontal or diagonal lines
15  but others may be non-linear combinations of symbols.
    Typically, the win lines will be constituted by symbol
    positions in the visible window.    A game outcome is
    determined based on the symbols on the win lines and a
    prize table that specifies awards.
20
         In some gaming machines, the prizes    (awards payable
    to a player) may include a so-called "jackpot".                The
    jackpot is a prize that is won at a random time throughout
    game play. Many venues employ jackpot controllers for
25  awarding jackpots to one of or more of a plurality of
    gaming machines participating in the jackpot.               Typically,
    a portion of turnover on each gaming machine is forwarded
    to a jackpot controller as a contribution.          That is, part
    of each wager from each gaming machine is forwarded to a
30  central  jackpot controller, and contributes to the
    jackpot.   The technique can be implemented within a single
    gaming machine or may be extended to a so-called wide area
    jackpot where multiple gaming machines    (from one or more
    different venues) contribute to a single jackpot pool. One
35  common way of awarding a jackpot is a so called "symbol
    driven"  jackpot, where a predetermined symbol pattern or
    win outcome triggers the jackpot.
                                                7650468_1 (GHMatters) P74416.AU.4 LIENM 14/02/2013

                                 - 18
        There may also be provided a number of different
   symbol driven jackpots. For example, three different
   "levels" of symbol driven jackpot may be offered, such as
 5 a mini  jackpot  (typically in the order of a hundred
   dollars),  a midi  jackpot  (typically in the order of a
   thousand dollars) and a maxi     jackpot  (typically in the
   order of tens of thousands of dollars).      Each symbol driven
   jackpot is denoted by a different     symbol. For example, one
10 type of symbol may be associated with a mini jackpot                            (say,
   a "Jackpotl" symbol),   another type of symbol may be
   associated with a midi   jackpot   (say, a "Jackpot2"                  symbol),
   and yet be associated with a maxi     jackpot    (say, a
   "Jackpot3" symbol).   In this manner, a player can instantly
15 recognise which type of    jackpot they have won, if the
   correct combination of   jackpot symbols appears at the
   conclusion of game play.
        Win outcomes   (such as the awarding of a jackpot) are
20 controlled by the game controller 60, which is shown in
   more detail in Figure   6.   It will be apparent that the
   processor 62 implements a number of modules, namely random
   number generator module 621,     symbol selector module 622,
   outcome determiner module 623,     award determiner module
25 624,  sequence monitoring module 625,     display controller
   module 626,  jackpot controller 627,     betting module 628 and
   trigger module 629, each of which may utilise data stored
   in memory 64.   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate
   that not all modules need be implemented by processor 62.
30 For example, the random number generator module 621 could
   be implemented by a separate circuit or by a random number
   generator server.
        In the illustrated embodiment, the award determiner
35 module 624 determines when a player is entitled to an
   award. The award, in some instances, may be triggered by a
   so-called "symbol   jackpot". That is, when a predetermined
                                                 7650468_1 (GHMatters) P74416.AU.4 LIENM 14/02/2013

                               - 19
   arrangement of symbols is displayed on the display, the
   player is awarded a jackpot prize. The   jackpot prize may
   be an internal jackpot particular to a single gaming
   machine or may be extended to a so called wide area
 5 jackpot where multiple gaming machines    (from one or more
   different venues) contribute to a single jackpot pool.
   Where a  jackpot is a wide area jackpot, it will be
   understood that the jackpot controller 627 may reside
   outside any individual gaming machine.
10
        During each game of a sequence, the symbol selector
   622 selects the symbols to appear based on symbol data 641
   which specifies the available symbols.     The      symbols are
   selected by the symbol selector using a random number
15 obtained from the random number generator 621.                 The
   outcome determiner module 623 determines the game outcomes
   and their associated prizes based on the number of pay
   lines the player is playing and the symbol combinations.
   This data may be stored as game/prize data 642 and/or
20 sequence data 643.   Persons skilled in the art will also
   appreciate that the game outcomes and their associated
   prizes are displayed on the display 54 or under control of
   the display controller 626.
25      An award determiner 624   is employed to keep track of
   the total award which is stored as total data 644.                      Where a
   jackpot is awarded, the award determiner 624 may interface
   with a  jackpot controller 627,  so that when a jackpot is
   won, the jackpot award can be determined and communicated
30 to the player, based on data received from the jackpot
   controller 627.  The jackpot controller 627 may be internal
   to a single gaming machine, or may be an external device
   arranged to interface with a plurality of gaming machines
   (as previously described).

        Referring now to an embodiment in which a win outcome
   is influenced, the method steps carried out by a gaming
                                               7650468_1 (GHMatters) P74416.AU.4 LIENM 14/02/2013

                                 - 20
   machine   (such as gaming device 120)   is described in more
   detail, with reference to the method 700,       summarised in
   Figure 7.   In Figure 7, the prize awarded is a jackpot
   prize. However, it will be understood that the embodiment
 5 described with reference to Figure 7 may apply equally to
   any win outcome.
         On commencement of game play 710, a player bets an
   amount of credits. The amount of credit bet           (determined by
10 the betting module 628)    is utilised to determine the size
   of the reel window 720. That is,     the larger the number of
   credits wagered by the player, the larger the reel window
    (i.e. the greater the number of symbol positions appearing
   in the reel window).   On the conclusion of game play, if a
15 symbol jackpot has been achieved     (i.e. if the correct
   number and/or pattern of symbols appears in the reel
   window),   a jackpot trigger message is sent to the trigger
   module 629 of the jackpot controller     (step 730) where it
   is compared 740 to the current value of the jackpot
20 trigger   (stored in memory).   From the comparison, it is
   determined 750 whether to award a jackpot. If no jackpot
   is awarded the game awaits further input     from a user                       (such
   as the initiation of a new game).     If a jackpot is to be
   awarded, the award is made 760 and the jackpot resets
25 before the next contribution is processed.
         Referring now to step 720 in more detail, the reel
   window is increased according to a player's wager or bet
   amount. The bet amount may be the amount of credits bet
30 per pay line, or the total bet amount     (i.e. the number of
   credits bet per line multiplied by the number of pay lines
   selected).    The manner in which the reel window is
   increased finds particular application in gaming machines
   that utilise Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd's
35  (a private Australian company) "Reel Power" technology.
   Reel power is a methodology whereby a player may purchase
   a "reel" rather than a row. This allows a player to
                                                7650468_1 (GHMatters) P74416.AU.4 LIENM 14/02/2013

                               - 21
   achieve a win by  (potentially) any combination of symbols
   in a reel window. For example, in a regular 5 by 3 window,
   by purchasing one reel  (i.e. 3 elements),   the player can
   form 3 possible paying "lines".  If a player purchases two
 5 reels, the player can form 3x3=9 pay line combinations,
   thereby further increasing their probability of forming a
   winning combination. If a player purchases three reels,
   the player can form 3x3x3=27 pay line combinations,
   increasing their probability of a win outcome once again.
10 The same is true for the purchase of 4 reels, which can
   form 81 pay line combinations, and 5 reels, which can                           form
   243 pay line combinations. Pay line combinations can also
   be referred to as "ways" or "win lines".
15      Applying the present embodiment to a Reel Power
   enabled gaming machine, it can be seen that increasing the
   reel window size  (ie. the addition of additional symbols)
   increases the chance of a player winning a prize. The
   prize may be a jackpot prize, or a non jackpot prize. The
20 winning of a  jackpot prize is best illustrated by an
   example, with the aid of Figures 8a and 8b.        In the example
   of Figures 8a and 8b, both examples are directed to an
   example where a jackpot is won by a player. However, it
   will be understood that the prize awarded may not be a
25 jackpot, but may be some other prize.
        Referring to Figure 8a, the display 54        is arranged to
   display a reel window 800 including five virtual reels as
   designated by reference numerals 802a through 802e. Each
30 virtual reel includes three standard symbol positions 804.
   In this example, players select columns of standard symbol
   positions to be included in their pay line combinations
   (i.e. such that symbols ultimately appearing in those
   selected symbol positions will be taken into account in
35 determining game outcomes, as previously described).                        For a
   bet of one  (1) credit per way, the reel window remains at
   the regular 5 by 3 reel window size   (i.e. a normal "243
                                              7650468_1 (GHMatters) P74416.AU.4 LIENM 14/02/2013

                                  - 22
   way" play) with 3,    9, 27,  81 and 243 way options. However,
   when the player's bet increases to two       (2) credits per
   way, the reel window is increased by the addition of two
   additional "spaces"    for a symbol to appear        (as shown in
 5 Figure 8b),   effectively increasing the play to a "432 way"
   reel window with 3,    12,  36, 144  and 432 way options.
         Correspondingly, when a player increases their bet to
   three   (3) credits  (not shown),   the reel window grows to
10 provide three additional spaces, providing a potential
   total of   576 ways, thereby further increasing the
   probability that a player can win a prize.
         Referring specifically to Figure     8a, a player is
15 betting one credit, three ways. The reel spin is initiated
   by the player pressing the bet button rather than the
   "way" button. The prize     (in this example a symbol prize
   jackpot) is won where three      (3) or more SCAT symbols
   appear at any location on the screen. As the player
20 receives only two SCAT symbols, no prize is won.
         If however   (referring to Figure 8b) the player
   chooses "3 ways" and presses the "bet 2" button, game play
   is initiated and reel window is enlarged to provide two
25 additional "symbol"    spaces. That is,   at the conclusion of
   game play the screen appears as shown in Figure 8b. As can
   be seen in Figure 8b, two additional symbols, denoted by
   810 and 820,   appear. In the example of Figure 8b,                     symbols
   810 and 820 are jackpot SCAT symbols. Therefore, as the
30 requirement for a    jackpot is three SCAT symbols, the
   player wins the jackpot.
         Referring now to Figures 8c and 8d, a further example
   embodiment is shown.     According to this example, the one
35 or more additional symbol positions are randomly
   associated with a particular row or column.               The
   additional symbol positions only become active                  (i.e.
                                                  7650468_1 (GHMatters) P74416.AU.4 LIENM 14/02/2013

   capable of displaying a symbol) if an amount bet by the
   player meets or exceeds a particular threshold.
         Referring to Figure 8c, the player has elected to
 5 play the first column only      (the centre line      symbol
   positions are always selected).       The dotted line                shows the
   resulting three pay lines that will be used in determining
   the game outcome.
10       The additional symbol positions are not            displayed
   until after the player has placed their bet            (e.g. by
   selecting a reel spin button),      so that the player is
   unable to establish whether the additional symbol
   positions will constitute part of a selected pay-line.
15 After the player has placed their bet, the symbol selector
   module 622 selects   symbols to display in the standard and
   additional   (if active) symbol positions.      According to
   Figure 8D, the player has elected to bet twenty                   (20)
   credits per pay line, which corresponds to two additional
20 symbol positions.    It will be appreciated by persons
   skilled in the art, however, that other betting functions
   could equally be used for determining the number of
   additional symbol positions to display apply              (e.g. the
   number of additional symbols may be a function of the
25 total amount bet,   etc.).
         With the aid of the RNG 621,     the two additional
   symbol positions 810,    820 are positioned on top of reels
   802a and 802e   (although it will be appreciated that the
30 additional symbol positions could be located either above
   or below the reels and equally on alternative ends of the
   rows).   In the illustrated example, since the additional
   symbol 810 falls atop a player selected column, the
   displayed symbol can be used in determining a game
35 outcome, whereas the second additional symbol 820 can not.
         In another embodiment, additional symbol spaces can
                                                 7650468_1 (GHMatters) P74416.AU.4 LIENM 14/02/2013

                               -  24
   be used to form new pay lines.     The player may, for
   example, be required to place an "ante-bet"          (i.e. a bet
   over and above their standard bet) upon commencement of a
   game, which allows extra pay lines which include the
 5 additional symbol spaces to be awarded.     Additional or
   alternative requirements may include that the additional
   symbol spaces are located in a particular position                       (e.g.
   atop a selected reel, etc).     If the requirements are met,
   the corresponding additional pay lines are used in
10 determining a game outcome.     According to such an
   embodiment, the player is rewarded for selecting more
   columns since there is a greater likelihood that the
   additional symbols will be used to constitute winning pay
   lines.   For example, according to the display
15 representation shown in Figure 8e, the player has                    selected
   to play the first three reels.     Thus, additional symbol
   positions 810 and 820 can both be used to form pay lines
   with already selected symbols, affectively increasing the
   number of player selected pay lines    from 27 to 48                  (i.e.
20 4x3x4xlxl=48).   If the player was to have purchased all
   reels, the number of resulting pay lines would equal 432
    (i.e.4x3x4x3x3=432), thereby greatly increasing the
   player's chance at achieving a winning outcome.
25       It will be understood that many variations may be
   made on the embodiment disclosed herein. For example, the
   symbols may not necessarily award the Jackpot, but may
   merely provide the player with a "chance" to win the
   jackpot, or the extra symbols may be utilised to form
30 other winning combinations    (not related to the winning of
   a  jackpot).
         In an embodiment where the additional symbols can
   result in a  jackpot win outcome, there may be provided a
35 plurality of symbol jackpots, each with a different value
   and each requiring a different    symbol combination to be
   displayed for a win. For example, three different levels
                                               7650468_1 (GHMatters) P74416.AU.4 LIENM 14/02/2013

                               - 25
   of symbol driven  jackpot may be offered, such as a mini
   jackpot  (typically in the order of a hundred dollars),                           a
   midi jackpot  (typically in the order of a thousand
   dollars) and a maxi jackpot   (typically in the order of
 5 tens of thousands of dollars).   Each symbol driven jackpot
   is denoted by a different  symbol. For example, one type of
   symbol may be associated with a mini   jackpot          (say, a
   "Jackpotl" symbol),  another type of symbol may be
   associated with a midi  jackpot  (say, a "Jackpot2"                  symbol),
10 and yet be associated with a maxi   jackpot    (say, a
   "Jackpot3" symbol).  In this manner, a player can instantly
   recognise which type of  jackpot they have won, if the
   correct combination of  jackpot symbols appears at the
   conclusion of game play. In such a scenario, the
15 additional symbols could display one or more of the three
   Jackpot symbols  (or a combination thereof).
        While the example given herein refers to a jackpot
   win outcome, it will be understood that the additional
20 symbols may be utilised to form any suitable winning
   combination  (jackpot or non jackpot).  Indeed, the
   embodiment of the border invention disclosed herein may be
   utilised on a gaming machine where no jackpot is
   available.
25
        It will be understood that while the embodiment
   described herein finds use with Aristocrat's           "reel power"
   technology, other embodiments may be utilised in a
   conventional gaming machine. The embodiment and the
30 broader invention described herein is not limited to one
   particular type of gaming machine. Such variations and
   modifications are within the purview of a person skilled
   in the art.
