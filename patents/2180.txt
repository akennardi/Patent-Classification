                            BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
   Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) poses a major obstacle in pharmaceutical
   industry, which usually leads to drug withdrawal from the market or assigned
   warning labels for regulatory issuance, e.g. bromfenac, troglitazone, and
15 trovafloxacin. Therefore, the assessment of potential DILI in early preclinical trial
   phase is essential and effective methods of predicting hepatotoxicity are desired.

           DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
   Example embodiments relate to methods of prediction of hepatotoxicity induced
   by drug reactive metabolites. The methods comprise steps of treating the
 5 compound with an effective amount of at least one model amino acid in
   microsome system; analyzing MS and MS/MS characteristics of products
   between the compound and the at least one model amino acids by LC-MS;
   identifying modification patterns of reactive metabolites between the compound
   and the at least one model amino acids by LC-MS and potential modified amino
10 acids; treating a microsome with an effective amount of the compound; analyzing
   MS and MS/MS characteristics of products between the compound and the
   microsome based on the identified modification patterns of reactive metabolites
   between the compound and the at least one model amino acids and potential
   modified amino acids by Multi-Dimension-LC-MS; identifying reactive metabolite
15 modified proteins by comparing analyzed MS and MS/MS characteristics of
   peptides with theoretical values with a peptide sequence database; and
   analyzing functions and relationship with hepatotoxicity of reactive metabolite
   modified proteins.
20 In one example embodiment, the model amino acids are N-acetyl lysine or N
   acetyl cysteine. In another embodiment for example, the Multi-Dimension-LC-MS
   is 2D strong cation exchange-reversed phase liquid chromatography. In another
   embodiment for example, the LC is ultrahigh performance LC and the MS is Q
   TOF-MS/MS system. In another embodiment for example, the microsome is
25 human liver microsome.
   Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is usually associated with modifications of cellular
   proteins by drug or drug reactive metabolites (RM). DILI by RM is very difficult to
   be determined due to the following reasons. Firstly, the drug must be
30 metabolized to exert the toxicity, so the biological model must have metabolic
   activity. Considering metabolism difference of different species, human metabolic
                                              6

   enzyme-containing model is preferred. Secondly, the existence time of RM is
   very short, and it will rapidly bind to proteins once formed, thus the existence
   form and amounts of RMs are hardly determined. Although based on the
   research    for  some    drugs    and   small   model   compounds      (e.g.   furan,
 5 acetaminophen,     epoxide,   etc), some structural     alerts and possible RM
   intermediates have been investigated, it is still difficult to predict the possible
   existence form of RMs for complex compounds in which several structural alerts
   might exist, for example toosendanin. Thirdly and importantly, it was found that
   the proteins adducted with RMs have significant influence on toxicity outcomes,
10 consequently the identification of specific modified proteins is essential for the
   prediction of DILI. However, the abundance of proteins modified by RMs is very
   low in complex biological samples, which poses serious analytical challenges.
   Although the immune-purified anti-drug antibody, biotin tag technique, and
   radiolabel approach had been successfully applied to detect the modified
15 proteins, these approaches require enough information on the metabolic active
   groups or substructures of drugs, which could not be changed during the
   synthesis of antigen, tagged drug, or radiolabeled drug. Moreover, the synthesis
   of these derivatives for drug with complex or sensitive structures is a challenge
   work. In recent years, shotgun proteome approaches were widely applied in the
20 determination of proteins based on the comparison of MS and MS/MS data of
   digested peptides with the database, e.g. Mascot. It was found that the addition
   of characteristic modification of RMs in Mascot increased the sensitivity of
   detection for    proteins adducted     with corresponding     RMs.    Similarly, the
   modification pattern of RMs is also studied for this method. Another influence
25 factor in shotgun approach is the separation of modified peptides from other high
   abundant intact peptides produced from complex biological system, which is
   necessary for the acquisition of corresponding MS and MS/MS.
   In one example embodiment, it provides a method to predict potential DILI of
   compounds using human liver microsome (HLM) and a new developed on-line
30 2D-nano-LC-MS approach (as shown in Figure la and Figure 1b). Firstly,
   possible modification patterns of RMs, binding amino acid (AA) residues, and
                                             7

   MS/MS characteristics are investigated using human liver microsome (HLM) and
   model amino acids by UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS.            Then, in order to improve the
   detection selectivity and sensitivity for low abundant modified peptides, an on
   line 2D-nano-LC-Q-TOF-MS/MS method is developed and applied therein. The
 5 RM-modified proteins can be identified by the comparison of acquired MS and
   MS/MS data of peptides with the theoretical values in Mascot. Finally, the
   functions and relationship with hepatotoxicity of RM-modified proteins are
   analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to predict the possible DILI.
   Utilizing this method, 6 proteins were found to be modified by TSN RMs, and IPA
10 analysis showed that some proteins were associated with liver toxicity. In a
   further example embodiment, the method is used to predict potential DILI of
   compounds       with complex structures.     Because  no   more   information   for
   compounds is required in advance, it may serve as a valuable method to predict
   potential DILI, especially for complex compounds.

   Example 1
   Material and Methods
   1. Chemicals and Materials.
   Toosendanin (TSN) with a purity of over 98% was supplied by National Institutes
20 for Food and Drug Control (Beijing, China). Pooled human liver microsomes
   (HLM) and NADPH-generating solutions A and B were bought from BD Gentest
   (San Jose, CA). HPLC grade acetonitrile (ACN) was provided by Anaqua
   Chemicals Supply Inc. Limited (Houston, TX). N-acetyl lysine (NAL), N-acetyl
   cysteine (NAC), glutathione (GSH), bicarbonate, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and
25 rabbit   muscle glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)              were
   obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was

                                             8

   Corporation). Water was produced by a Milli-Q Ultrapure water system (Millipore,
   Billerica, MA) with the water outlet operating at 18.2 MO.
   2. Incubation of Toosendanin and Amino Acids (AAs) in Human Liver Microsome
 5 Stock solutions of TSN were prepared in methanol at the concentration of 1
   mg/mL. TSN (50 pM) was diluted with potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4; 0.1
   M) and NADPH-generating solutions A and B supplemented with NAL, NAC or
   GSH at a final concentration of 5.0 mM followed by pre-incubated at 370C for 2
   min. Then HLM (1.0 mg/mL) was added to initiate the metabolic reaction. The
10 total incubation volume was 400 pL. Equal volume about 50 1I of incubation
   solutions were collected at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, respectively. The
   reactions were quenched by mixing with 5 volumes of ice-cold acetonitrile and
   put on the ice. The samples were processed by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 10
   min. The supernatants were collected and dried with flowing nitrogen. The
15 residues were reconstituted with 50 pL aliquot of 50% methanol in water and
   centrifuged prior to UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis.
   3. Incubation of Toosendanin with BSA or GAPDH in Human Liver Microsome
   BSA or GAPDH (1 mg/mL) was incubated with TSN (50 pM), solutions A and B,
20 and HLM (1.0 mg/mL) for 120 min at 370C. After centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5
   min, the supernatants were collected and mixed with 4 volumes of iced acetone.
   After centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min, the precipitates were collected and re
   dissolved in urea (8 M). The protein contents were quantitated by DC Protein
   Assay Reagent. The samples without BSA/GAPDH were also prepared in
25 parallel. Samples were prepared in triplicate.
   4. Protein Digestion
   The protein solutions were diluted with water to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL,
   and reduced with DTT (200 mM) for 60 min at room temperature. Then, IAA (1 M)
30 was added and incubated for 60 min in the dark. The reaction mixture was
   quenched with DTT (200 mM) at room temperature for 60 min. Samples were
                                             9

   diluted with 25 mM bicarbonate until the concentration of urea was below 1 M.
   Finally, the proteins (100 pg) were digested with 2 pg trypsin at 370C overnight.
   Digests were cleaned-up using SPE C18 cartridge, and the elution was dried
   under nitrogen and stored at -200C.

   5. LC-Q-TOF-MS/MS Analysis
   (1) UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS. An Agilent 1290 infinity UHPLC with binary pump, auto
   sampler, thermostatted column compartment coupled with 6550 Q-TOF-MS
   system was used for the identification of the reaction products of TSN and AAs.
io The conditions were same as our earlier report. Negative mode was used in this
   study. (2) Nano-LC-Q-TOF-MS. Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC UPLC system
   (Rockford) in-line with a Bruker maXis Impact Q-TOF-MS was employed to
   separate and identify the peptides. The digested peptides were dissolved in 50 pl
   of 2% ACN-containing 0.1% TFA, and loaded onto an Acclaim PepMap RSLC
15 nanoViper trap column (75 pm      x 2 cm, 3 pm, Thermo) using 2% ACN/0.05%
   TFA as the loading buffer. The peptides were then separated on an Acclaim
   PepMap RSLC nanoViper C18 analytical column (75 pm        x 15 cm, 2 pm, Thermo)
   at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid (FA)
   in water (A) and 0.1% FA in ACN (B) with the following gradient: 0-8 min, 5% B;
20 8-110 min, linearly increased B from 5% to 40%; 110-110.1 min, linearly
   increased B from 40% to 80%; 110.1-115 min, 80% B; 115-115.1 min, returned
   back to 5% B; 115.1-120min, 5% B. The injection volume was 1 pL. Bruker
   Advance CaptiveSpray ion source was used at positive mode. The temperature
   of dry gas was 1600C and the flow rate was 4.0 L/min. The end plate offset and
25 the capillary was set at 500 and 1400 V, respectively. Top 10 precursors were
   selected over the range between m/z 330 and 1400 per second, and single
   charged ions were excluded, while the precursor ions with charge states +2, +3,
   and +4 were preferred for MS/MS analysis. (3) 2D SCX-nano-LC-Q-TOF-MS.
   The tryptic peptides (20 ptg) were firstly loaded onto a strong cation exchange
30 column (PolySULFOETHYL ATM, 0.3         x  100 mm), and eluted successively by a
   series of ammonium acetate elutions with the concentrations of 5, 10, 25, 50,
                                            10

   and 100 mM at pH 2.7. The volume of each elution was 20 pL. Each eluate from
   SCX column was transferred to C18 trap column and further desalted with
   solution A (0.1% FA in 2% ACN) at 5 pL/min for 30 min. Finally, the desalted
   fractions were separated in a C18 analytical column at 300 nL/min using 0.1%
 5 FA in water (A) and 0.1% FA in ACN (B) with the following gradient: 0-30 min,
   5% B; 30-120 min, linearly increased B from 5% to 15%; 120-140 min, linearly
   increased B from 15% to 50%; 140-150 min, linearly increased B from 50% to
   80%.
10 6. Identification of modified proteins
   MS spectral data were processed using Bruker Compass DataAnalysis software,
   and the generated peak lists were converted into the Mascot search engine
   against the Swiss-Prot 51.6 database. The molecular compositions of 7 possible
   TSN modifications (Table 1) were input into the university Mascot server as
15 variable modifications, while cysteine carbamidomethyl (C) and methionine
   Oxidation (M) were selected as variable modification too. The following
   parameters were used for database search, monoisotopic and MS/MS Ions
   search were selected; precursor and MS/MS mass tolerance was set at 20 ppm
   and 0.2 Da, respectively; peptide charge was 2+, 3+ and 4+; maximum missed
20 cleavages was 1; statistical significance was set at p < 0.05; trypsin was selected
   as enzyme..
   7. Biological Function and Pathway Analysis
   The identified proteins conjugated with TSN RMs were uploaded and mapped
25 into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) database for pathway analysis as
   described previously. The "Molecular and Cellular Functions" and "Tox lists" of
   these proteins were explored by "Tox analysis" to predict the molecular
   mechanism of compound toxicity. Further, the network construction was
   performed by uploading protein         IDs into IPA to discover the biological
30 relationships between these proteins.
                                             11

   Example 2
   1. Identification of TSN RM conjugates with amino acids
   Two AAs, N-acetyl lysine (NAL) and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), were firstly applied
 5 to capture RM, which is usually unstable and only exists very short time. At the
   presence of HLM, TSN was incubated with NAC and NAL, respectively, and then
   the products were analyzed by UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS. Four NAL adducts, AL1 -AL4,
   were detected as shown in Figure 5. AL3 and AL4 at the retention time (tr) of 7.3
   and 8.1 min had the same deprotonated molecular ion peak ([M-H]-) at m/z
10 757.32, which matches the elemental composition             of C38H5oN2014. The
   molecular formula is 4H less than the sum of TSN (C3oH38011) and NAL
   (C8H16N203).    AL3 and AL4 shared the same fragmentation ions at m/z 697.30
   [M-H-CH3COOH]-, 653.31 [M-H-CH3COOH-CO2]-, 611.30 [M-H-CH3COOH-CO2
   CH2CO]-,     and 593.29 [M-H-CH3COOH-CO2-CH2CO-H20]-,           and the MS/MS
15 patterns were similar to that of the dehydrogenation metabolite of TSN.
   Consequently, AL3 and AL4 should be formed from this metabolite and NAL. The
   fragmentation ions at m/z 279.14 and 309.15 had the elemental compositions of
   C14H19N204      and C15H21N205,    which seemed indicating the formation        of
   substituted-3-pyrroline-2-one moiety by the addition of amino group to furan
20 residue in TSN, and the fragmentation ion should be generated from the
   cleavage of NAL-containing residue from the broken of ring D as shown in Figure
   2a - Figure 2d. This is the first report on TSN dehydrogenation metabolite-NAL
   conjugates, while the analogue of AL1 and AL2, TSN-lysine conjugate had been
   detected from rats. These results indicated that TSN metabolites had the
25 possibility to adduct with lysine residue in proteins and the modification patters
   were C30H36011 (T1-K) and C30H34011 (T2-K).
   Similarly, seven NAC adducts of TSN metabolites, AC1-AC7, were also detected
   from the incubation in HLM. The peak at 6.2 min (AC1) showed a molecular ion
   [M-H]- at     m/z 750.2411,    which   matches the elemental      composition   of
30 C35H45NO15S (Table 1). The fragmentation ions at m/z 621.2134 ([M-H-C5H7NO3]-)
                                            12

   and 162.0248 [NAC-H]- in MS/MS spectrum as shown in Figure 3a indicated the
   formation of TSN metabolite-NAC conjugate by C-S bond. Other fragmentation
   ions related with the neutral losses of CH3COOH, H20, and CH2CO, which
   produced from the cleavages of substitute groups in TSN. The molecular
 5 composition of TSN metabolite in AC1 was deduced to be CoH36012, i.e.
   monooxygenation      product as shown         in Figure 3b. AC2-AC6      had   the
   deprotonated molecular ions at m/z 752.2589, 766.2382, 674.2288, 692.2351,
   and 692.2381, which correspond to the molecular formulae of C35H47NO15S,
   C35H45NO 16S, C33H41NO12S, C33H 43NO 1 3S, and C33H43NO13S, respectively. As
10 shown in Figure 5, the MS/MS spectra showed that they were NAC conjugates
   with   TSN     metabolites,   monooxygenation       and  hydrogenation    product,
   dioxygenation product, deacetylation and dehydration product, and deacetylation
   product, respectively. Differently to AC1 -AC6, the molecular formula of AC7,
   C38H5oN2O16S2, indicated that two NAC groups connected with deacetylation
15 TSN metabolite, which was also shown in Figure 5. These results indicated that
   TSN RMs might covalently modify cysteine residue in proteins too, and there
   were 5 possible modification patterns, which were different to the modification for
   lysine, as shown in Figure 5.
   In order to determine which kind of modification, N- or S-, is easier, an amino
20 and sulfydryl-containing tripeptide, glutathione (GSH) was used as trapping agent.
   Four GSH conjugates with TSN RMs, AG1-AG4, were detected, as shown in
   Figure 5. AG3 showed a molecular ion [M-H]- at m/z 876.2856, which
   corresponds to the elemental composition of C4oH51N3O17S. The fragmentation
   ion at m/z 842.3014 producing from the neutral loss of H2S and a S-containing
25 GSH characteristic fragmentation ion at m/z 160.0090 provided the evidence that
   GSH bound to TSN RM via an amino group rather than a sulfydryl group as
   shown in Figure 4a. RM of TSN in AG3 was identified as C30H34011, i.e. the
   dehydrogenation metabolite as shown in Figure 4b. This was the first report on
   the dehydrogenation TSN RM-GSH conjugate. Besides, three known GSH
30 conjugates, AG1, AG2, and AG4, were also detected, as shown in Figure 5. AG1
   and AG2 were also produced by N-modification, while AG4 was formed by both
                                             13

   of N- and S-connections. AG1, AG2, and AG3 exhibited the neutral losses of
   CH3COOH, CH2CO, and H20 from TSN RMs and AA residues from GSH at
   positive mode.
   Based on above results, RMs of TSN were found to have the potential to modify
 5 AA residues in proteins via both of amino- and sulfhydryl- group, while the former
   modification seems predominant. Moreover, the modification for lysine mainly
   exist as two forms with the molecular compositions of C30H36011 and CaoH34O11,
   while the connection with cysteine include six different forms, as shown in Figure
   5. Considering RMs of TSN might modify AA residues in cellular proteins using
io the same way, the molecular compositions were added on the corresponding AA
   residues in Mascot as variable modification.
   2. Identification of TSN RM Adducts with BSA and GAPDH
   To determine whether this method could work, the protein adducts formed with
15 TSN RMs were firstly detected using two model proteins, bovine serum albumin
   (BSA) and rabbit muscle glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
   After incubation with TSN at the presence of HLM followed by digestion with
   trypsin, the peptides were subjected to nano-LC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis. The
   acquired MS and MS/MS information were input into Mascot for the identification
20 of peptides. Seven possible TSN RM modification patterns identified in TSN RM
   AA adducts, as shown in Figure 5, were added as variable modifications in
   Mascot in advance. Four peptides of BSA were found to conjugate with two
   different kinds of TSN RMs at lysine, as shown in Figure 6. The modified peptide
   of ALKAWSVAR had the quasi-molecular ion of [M+2H] 2+ at m/z 786.4148, which
25 was 570 Da more than corresponding non-modified peptide, as shown in Figure
   7a - Figure 7b. The fragmentation ions of y7 and b3 were also observed an
   increase of 570 Da compared with that of non-modified peptide, therefore the
   lysine should be modified by TSN dehydrogenation metabolite, i.e. T2-K
   modification on K235, as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6. The fragmentation ions
30 of y8 and b4 further confirmed the modification pattern and binding site, while
   other fragmentation ions, y2 - y6, indicated that the peptide belonged to
                                           14

   ALKAWSVAR. Extracted Ion Chromatograms (EIC) showed that the MS intensity
   of non-modified peptide was evidently higher than that of modified peptide as
   shown in Figure 7c - Figure 7d, which indicated that good separation is very
   important for MS and MS/MS acquisition of modified peptides by decreasing the
 5 interference of co-eluting components. The lysine in peptide SLGKVGTR was
   found to be adducted by two modification patterns, T1-K and T2-K as shown in
   Figure 6. In order to ensure the modifications were compound related, the
   parallel control without TSN was also analyzed using the same procedure, and
   no any add ucted peptide was detected (data not shown).
10 Using the same method, six TSN RM-adducted peptides of GAPDH were
   identified as shown in Figure 6. Similarly to BSA, the modifications for GAPDH
   took place on lysine rather than cysteine. It seems indicated that TSN RMs have
   higher specificity for amino group than sulfhydryl group, like the reaction with
   GSH.

   3. Establishment of an on-line 2D-nano-LC-MS approach
   The proposed method was confirmed to have the potential to determine RM
   modified proteins using above two model proteins. Next we applied this method
   to search the adducted microsomal proteins. As observed in RM-modified BSA,
20 the efficient separation of RM-modified protein digests is critical for the
   identification of corresponding proteins from the comprehensive biological
   samples. Multi-dimensional liquid chromatography, which combines two or more
   orthogonal separation procedures in a consecutive manner, can provide
   excellent resolution, consequently is widely applied in shotgun proteomics.
25 Especially, 2D strong cation exchange-reversed phase liquid chromatography
   (2D SCX-RPLC) exhibited high detection sensitivity and outstanding separation
   performance because of the combination of electrostatic interaction on SCX
   column and hydrophobic interaction on C18 column. Accordingly, an on-line 2D
   SCX-nano-LC-Q-TOF-MS approach was developed to dig out the possible TSN
30 RM adducted proteins in HLM system. By the combination of increasing loading
   amounts of proteins, fractionation on SCX column, and adjusting the gradient of
                                           15

   mobile phase on RPLC column, a better separation was obtained using 2D SCX
   nano-LC-MS approach than nano-LC-MS. It resulted in the increase of identified
   proteins and peptides by 91.5% (1,494 vs. 780) and 185.7% (16,706 vs. 5,847),
   respectively,    using developed 2D        method than   1D   approach   used for
 5 identification of TSN RM adducts with BSA and GPDAH as shown in Figure 8.
   Furthermore, the average protein sequence coverage also increased obviously
   from 7.5 peptides/protein in 1D approach to 11.2 peptides/protein in 2D analysis.
   4. Identification of TSN RM-modified proteins in Microsome
io After incubation with HLM under the same conditions without the addition of
   model proteins, the digested peptides were subjected to 2D SCX-nano-LC-Q
   TOF-MS analysis followed by searching for objective proteins in Mascot. At least
   6 proteins were found to be covalently modified by RMs of TSN as shown in
   Figure 9. The unique peptide of         42 3
                                               LSKDPNIVIAK 4 33 for protein disulfide
15 isomerase A3 (PDIA3) showed a molecular ion [M+3H] 3 + at m/z 590.6524, which
   was 572 Da more than that of corresponding non-modified peptide, therefore it
   should be modified by T1-K. The binding site was deduced to be K425 from the
   same mass increase of 572 Da in the fragmentation ions of b5- be, and ye of the
   aged peptide compared to the unaged peptide as shown in Figure 10a. Similarly,
20 T1-K was found to covalently connect with the following proteins, K1016 of
   RRBP1 , K1197 of MYH14, K704 of CTNA1 as shown in Figure 10b, Figure 10d,
   and Figure 10e, respectively. Differently to the model proteins, the modification
   on cysteine residues was detected from the microsomal proteins. For example,
   the cysteine of IAVAAQNCYK for triosephosphate isomerase (TPIS) was
25 believed to be the binding site from the mass increase of 588 Da for the quasi
   molecular ion [M+2H] 2+ at m/z 834.8952 and the fragmentation ions of y4       - y8
   compared with the unaged peptide, as shown in Figure 1Oc. Similarly, T3-C was
   found to covalently connect with the following proteins, C948 of VIGLN as shown
   in Figure 10f. The identification of these TSN RM-modified microsomal proteins
30 indicated that the proposed method is also applicable for the determination of
                                              16

   RM-protein adducts formed from the complex compounds with the proteins in
   complicated biological system.
   5. Biological Functions and Pathway Analysis of TSN RM-modified proteins
 5 To explore the biological functions, pathway, and toxicity of TSN RM-modified
   proteins, bioinformatics analysis was conducted using IPA software. "Tox
   categories and functions" explored by the "Tox analysis" in IPA showed that the
   modified proteins were associated with "Hepatotoxicity", "Cadiotoxicity", and
   "Nephrotoxicity", especially the hepatotoxicity, which was found to correlate with
10 4 TSN RM adducted proteins, including triosephosphate isomerase (TPIS),
   ribosome-binding protein 1 (RRBP1), catenin alpha-1 (CTNA1)             and vigilin
   (VIGLN). And the Hepatotoxicity categories were highly enriched in Liver
   Cholestasis, Liver Hyperplasia/Hyperproliferation, Hepatocellular Carcinoma and
   Hyperplasia/Hyperproliferation. Moreover, based on the -log p-value, the top
15 pathways involved in canonical pathways included glucose metabolism enzymes
   in glycolysis I (TP11), sucrose degradation v (TP11), lipid metabolism enzymes in
   glutathione redox reactions II (PDIA3) and lipid antigen presentation by CD1
   (PDIA3)    and calcium signaling (MYH14), suggesting that protein adduct
   formation    by TSN      may impair energy metabolism,       redox reaction and
20 endoplasmic reticulum stress and calcium signaling.
   It is based on one possible hepatotoxicity mechanism, i.e. the modification of
   drug RM on proteins will influence their functions and induce liver injury. The key
   points in this method include the identification of RMs and potential modified AA
25 residues in human liver microsome, and high efficient separation of the modified
   peptides with other high abundant non-adducted peptides. The use of human
   liver microsome makes the results have better relevance to clinical outcomes.
   This method was found to work well even for compounds with complex structure,
   e.g. TSN in this research. No pretreatment is required for the drugs or
30 compounds, consequently it serves as a valuable method to predict potential
   DILI, especially for complex compounds.
