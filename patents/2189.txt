A stop for a blade of an oscillating multitool, wherein the stop prevents the blade from
penetrating the material being cut beyond the required cut depth.

       Multi-tool Blade Depth Stop Limiter - Description and Claim
I, Colin Gormley have uncovered a requirement from utilising an oscillating multitool to stop
the blade from penetrating too deeply into the material being cut.
My claim regarding this invention is that my design differs from other depth stops because it
attaches to the actual blade - thus restricting the amount of cutting depth from the cutting
tip of the teeth to the designed depth of the stop - in this instance 5mm but other variants
will allow different depths if necessary. This is inventive and differs from existing depth stop
designs in that the stop is fixed to the cutting blade rather than to the cutting tool itself.
Our specific use of the multitool is to cut into PVC communications and electrical conduit
that has various cables already located inside the conduit. Without a method of setting the
necessary depth of the cut we risk cutting deeper than expected and thus causing damage
to the cabling contained within the conduit.
A subsequent search in the industry for products or tools that provided this stop facility on a
tool did not find anything suitable due to the confined spaces within which cutting had to
take place. I then started to think about how we could fix something to the blade itself to
limit the depth achieved.
I found a blade type that came with preformed slots in the blade and decided that these
could be used to locate something on the blade. I then, on 15/01/2018 designed a shape
that would bolt onto the blades and allow a 5mm depth of cut around the perimeter of the
blade.
The material selected was stainless steel and proved to be quite heavy causing excess
vibration through the tool and over heating
Next, different materials were chosen to try to reduce weight however some lighter
materials were not as durable as the metals therefore a new streamline design in the
aluminium was chosen as rev 2.
Field tests were conducted and although the streamlined material was much better it still
resulted in early tool fatigue.
It was then decided to try a smaller semi circle blade and create a jig to set the blades in so
that 3 x holes could be laser cut into the blade in a repeatable location so that a new design
of blade depth stop limiter could be fitted using rivets
This new design rev 3 is currently being trialled in the field and initial feedback is very good
- hence my intention to patent this design with the intention of selling it to our clients and
competitors
