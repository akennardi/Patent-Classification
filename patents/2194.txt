                                      Field of the Invention
 [0002] The present invention relates to the field of water treatment, and, more
 particularly, to the distillation of water using solar power.
                                 Background of the Invention
[0003] Fresh water is a critical need in many parts of the world. Other contaminated
water or liquid, such as oil field frac water and industrial waste water, also needs to
be processed before being disposed. A number of different methods have been
developed for processing seawater or other contaminated water that is not portable
to provide fresh water.
[0004] One approach is to use settling and filtration systems to remove relatively
large impurities from the seawater or contaminated water. Filtration is also capable
of removing smaller contaminants down to the size of bacteria, and perhaps even
smaller particulates in certain cases. However, filtration systems capable of
removing contaminants down to ionic size are quite costly, both in terms of
manufacture and in maintenance as well.
[0005]An alternative method of water purification is distillation, Distillation works well
in the removal of virtually all impurities from water. Distillation is used in many areas
for the desalination of seawater. However, most distillation processes require
considerable heat to produce sufficient evaporation since the water is heated to

  boiling to accelerate the evaporation process. This is particularly true of large-scale
  distilling operations.
  [0006] Passive sources of energy (e.g., solar energy) have been developed to
  produce the required heat for evaporation. One approach for a solar-powered
 distillation system to produce fresh water from seawater is disclosed in U.S. Patent
  No. 8,613,840. The solar-powered distillation system includes a heat-absorbent
 evaporation panel having mutually opposed evaporation surfaces. The panel is
 contained within a housing. Each side of the housing includes a lens panel. The
 lenses of each panel focus solar energy onto the respective surfaces of the
 evaporation panel. A mirror is positioned to each side of the housing to reflect solar
 energy onto the respective lens panels. Contaminated water enters the top of the
 housing to run down the surfaces of the evaporation panel. A fresh water collection
 pipe extends from the top of the housing to a collection tank. A scraper mechanism
 removes salt and/or other residue from the surfaces of the evaporation panel to allow
 the residue to be removed periodically from the bottom of the housing.
 [0007] Another approach for a solar-powered distillation system is provided by
 WaterFX. Solar troughs reflect sunlight to a pipe filled with a heat transfer fluid
 (HTF), such as mineral oil. The heated mineral oil powers a heat pump. The heat is
 fed to a multi-effect or multi-stage distillation system that evaporates freshwater from
 the seawater or contaminated water. The multi-effect approach to evaporating
 freshwater is efficient since each stage essentially reuses the energy from a previous
stage. The steam that is produced condenses into pure liquid water, and the
remaining salt solidifies and can be removed.
[0008] Even in view of the above solar distillation approaches there is still a need to
improve upon such a system for processing seawater or other contaminated water
that is not portable to provide fresh water.
                                Summary of the Invention
[0009]A solar distillation system includes a plurality of solar panels configured to
reflect sunlight, and a plurality of receivers adjacent the plurality of solar panels and
configured to receive process water to be processed to purified process water. The
plurality of receivers may comprise at least a first receiver and a last receiver, with
the process water flowing from the first receiver to the last receiver and being heated
by the reflected sunlight.
                                                2

  [0010] Vapor tubes may be coupled to the receivers, with each respective vapor tube
  being coupled between adjacent receivers. Water vapor is generated as the process
  water is heated within each receiver, with the water vapor flowing via the respective
  vapor tubes between the adjacent receivers towards the last receiver,
  [0011]A return vapor tube may be coupled to the last receiver, and a distillation tube
  may be coupled to the return vapor tube to receive the water vapor. The distillation
 tube may extend through the plurality of receivers from the last receiver to the first
  receiver. As the water vapor travels through the distillation tube the water vapor
 changes to a liquid, with the liquid being the purified process water.
  [0012] The plurality of receivers may be connected in series so that each receiver
  uses heat energy from a previous receiver to heat the process water, except for the
 first receiver. In other words, the process water may be heated in stages, with each
 receiver corresponding to a stage. A multi-stage or multi-effect approach to heating
 the process water is efficient since each stage essentially reuses the energy from a
 previous stage. As the process water is heated within each receiver, the water vapor
 is generated.
 [0013] Each receiver may be filled by the process water except for an air gap so as
 to allow the water vapor to develop. The distillation tube may extend through each
 receiver below the air gap. The distillation tube may be in direct contact with the
 process water within each receiver, and as the water vapor changes to the liquid
within the distillation tube heat is given off. The heat given off during this phase
 change may be provided to each stage, thus further increasing the efficiency of the
 solar distillation system. An output of the distillation tube provides the purified
 process water.
[0014] Each vapor tube may extend between the air gaps in adjacent receivers. Each
 receiver has a given volume, and the air gap may be about 10 to 20% of the given
volume.
[0015] The plurality of solar panels may be configured as parabolic troughs, with the
plurality of receivers being positioned within a focal point of the plurality of solar
panels. Each receiver may have an I-shape or a double Y-shape.
[0016] The solar distillation system may further comprise a plurality of auxiliary heat
sources adjacent the plurality of receivers. The solar distillation system may further
comprise a vacuum coupled to the distillation tube to direct flow of the water vapor
through the plurality of receivers and the distillation tube. The solar distillation system
                                              3

 may further comprise a pump coupled to the first receiver to control a flow rate of the
 process water through the plurality of receivers.
 [0017] The process water may comprise at least one of sea water, frac water and
 waste water. The last receiver may output the process water that does not turn to
 water vapor.
 [0018] A method for processing process water to purified process water using a solar
 distillation system as described above comprises is provided. The method comprises
 reflecting sunlight from the plurality of solar panels to the plurality of receivers, and
 providing the process water to the plurality of receivers. The process water flows
 from the first receiver to the last receiver and may be heated by the reflected
 sunlight. Water vapor may be generated within each receiver as the process water is
 heated, with the water vapor flowing via the respective vapor tubes between the
 adjacent receivers towards the last receiver. The method may further comprise
 providing the water vapor from the return vapor tube at the last receiver to the
distillation tube, and as the water vapor travels through the distillation tube the water
vapor changes to a liquid, with the liquid being the purified process water,

                   Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments
 [0029] The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with
 reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the
 invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different
 forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein.
 Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and
 complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.
 Like numbers refer to like elements throughout, and prime and double notations are
 used to indicate similar elements in alternative embodiments.
 [0030] Referring initially to FIG. 1, a multi-effect solar distillation system 20 includes a
 plurality of receivers 30(1)-30(n) and a plurality of solar panels 40(1)-40(n) adjacent
 the plurality of receivers. Each receiver is positioned within a focal point of a
 respective solar panel.
 [0031] The water to be processed will be generally referred to as process water 50.
 The process water 50 may be sea water, oil field frac water or industrial waste water,
 for example. The process water 50 is heated as it flows through each of the
 receivers 30(1)-30(n). As the process water 50 is heated, water vapor is generated,
 which will eventually provide purified process water 60.
 [0032] The process water 50 is heated in stages, with each receiver corresponding to
a stage. A multi-stage or multi-effect approach to heating the process water 50 is
efficient since each stage essentially reuses the energy from a previous stage. As
the process water 50 is heated within each receiver, water vapor is generated.
[0033] In the illustrated embodiment, a small percentage of the process water 50 is
turned to vapor as it travels through the receivers 30(1)-30(n). This percentage may
be within a range of about 10-20%, for example. The last receiver 30(n) directs the
remaining process water 54 to the sea if it is sea water, or to a holding tank for
further processing if it is oil field frac water or industrial waste water.
[0034] Water vapor flows between adjacent receivers 30(1), 30(2) via a vapor tube
32 connected therebetween. At the last receiver 30(n), a return vapor tube 34 is
connected to a distillation tube 36. The return vapor tube 34 directs the vapor to an
                                                5

 input of the distillation tube 36. The distillation tube 36 extends through each of the
 receivers 30(1)-30(n) but is separate from the process water 52 circulating within
 each receiver.
 [0035] As the water vapor travels through the distillation tube 36, it changes phases
 back to a liquid. The heat given off during this phase change is provided to each
 respective stage, thus further increasing the efficiency of the illustrated multi-effect
 solar distillation system 20. An output of the distillation tube 36 provides the purified
 process water 60.
 [0036] Since the process water 50 flows through the receivers 30(1)-30(n) instead of
 a heat transfer fluid (HTF), the illustrated multi-effect solar distillation system 20 is
 also referred to as an "in-situ" multi-effect solar distillation system.
 [0037] The process water 50 enters an input 33 of the first receiver 30(1) and fills the
 first receiver 30(1) except for an air gap 35 at the top so as to allow water vapor to
 develop, as illustrated in FIG. 2. The air gaps 35 may be about 10-20% of the
 volume of the receivers. The distillation tube 36 is positioned so that it is below the
 gap gap 35. As noted above, positioning the distillation tube 36 in contact with the
 process water 50 advantageously allows heat to be given off as the water vapor
changes phases back to a liquid.
 [0038] An output 37 of the first receiver 30(1) is connected to an input 33 of the
second receiver 30(2). The process water 52 fills the second receiver 30(2) except
for another air gap 35 at the top so as to allow water vapor to develop. This process
continues for each of the receivers.
[0039]A vapor tube 32 couples together the air gaps 35 in any two adjacent
receivers. In the illustrated example, a vapor tube 32 provides a passageway for the
water vapor to travel from the air gap 35 in the first receiver 30(1) to the air gap 35 in
the second receiver 30(2). This process continues for each of the receivers, At the
last receiver 30(n), a return vapor tube 34 couples the air gap 35 therein to the
distillation tube 36, as illustrated in FIG. 3.
[0040] As will now be discussed in greater detail, the multi-effect solar distillation
system 20 includes multiple components for heating the process water 50 to the
desired temperature. These components include a structure to preheat the process
water, a parabolic trough for the capture of solar thermal energy, a circulation pump,
a receiver with a large solar impingement area and a low interior volume, and a
distillation tube.
                                               6

 [0041] To further improve heating of the process water 50, the multi-effect solar
 distillation system 20 may include a vacuum pump or system 72 coupled to the
 distillation tube to help lower the boiling temperature of the process water 50 as well
 as provide direction to the flow of the water vapor. In addition, a plurality of auxiliary
 heat sources 42(1)-42(n) may be positioned adjacent the plurality of receivers 30(1)
 30(n) to allow for low or no sun operation. The auxiliary heat sources 42(1)-42(n)
 may be gas burners, for example.
 [0042] Preheat can be accomplished by storing the process water 50 in a lined pond
 or tank with a large surface exposure area that is covered by a greenhouse style
 building. The building has sides and a roof made from a clear material that will let the
 ambient solar energy in and warm the stored process water 50. The roof of the
 building may be shaped so as to channel any water vapor that will condense into a
 collector as this will be purified process water. The building may be constructed so
that minimal heat and water vapor will be lost to the outside environment so as to
increase efficiency.
 [0043]The solar panels 40(1)-40(n) may be configured as large aperture parabolic
troughs, as illustrated in FIG. 4. Each parabolic trough includes a reflective material
for directing the sunlight to a focal point. The reflective material may be glass mirrors
or thin reflective film, for example. The parabolic troughs may be placed in series to
allow for the heating of the process water 50 to a proper temperature.
[0044] A pump 70 moves the process water through the receivers 30(1)-30(n), as
illustrated in FIG. 1. The pump 70 includes controls to vary the flow rate of the
process water 50. Control of the flow rate controls a rate of evaporation of the
process water 50. The flow rate of the process water 50 through the receivers 30(1)
30(n) may be within a range of about 5-15 gallons per minutes, for example. As
readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, the flow rate is selected so that a
desired percentage of the process water vaporizes as it travels through the receivers
30(1)-30(n). As the flow rate is increased, then the number of receiver stages would
also need to be increased to obtain the desired temperate to vaporize the process
water 50. The flow rate is inversely proportional to the energy absorbed by the
receivers 30(1)-30(n).
[0045]The receivers 30(1)-30(n) are configured to provide a large solar impingement
area, yet have a low interior volume. The receivers 30(1)-30(n) are located within the
parabolic trough 40(1)-40(n) so that the solar energy is reflected thereon from both
                                              7

  upper and lower halves of the parabolic trough. The receivers 30(1)-30(n) are
  mounted so that they may be adjusted to aid in an optimum position to receive the
  solar energy.
  [0046] A fill port or input 33 and an exit port of output 37 at a bottom of each receiver
  allows for the process water 50 to enter and exit. The receiver is not limited to any
  particular design. One example design of a receiver 30(1) is an ]-shape, as
  illustrated in FIG. 5. The I-shaped receiver 30(1) is sized according to the
  corresponding parabolic trough 40(1). Example dimensions are 6 inch top and
 bottom sections centered perpendicular to a 12 inch vertical section. This structure is
 hollow on the inside to allow for the process water to be directed down the length of
 the receiver.
 [0047] Several inches down from the top of the vertical sides would flare away from
 each other to increase the overall width to allow for the placement of the distillation
 or condensate tube 36. The I-shaped receiver 30(1) is sealed to collect the water
 vapor being created by the heating of the process water. The water level is
 controlled so that there will be a gap or void 35 at the top of the I-shaped receiver
 30(1) to allow for the collection of the water vapor. An opening at the top of the
 receiver 30(1) directs the clean water vapor to a vapor tube 32 coupled to an
 adjacent receiver. The 6 inch wide top and bottom section of the receiver 30(1)
provides an additional area to capture solar energy. All dimensions are approximate
 and may be changed to ensure optimum solar impingement along the receiver 30(1).
 [0048JAnother example design of a receiver is a double Y-shaped receiver 30(1)', as
illustrated in FIG. 6. The dimensions will be approximately 5.6 x 13 inches. This
hollow double Y-shaped receiver 30(1)' features a thin vertical chamber section with
a Y-shaped section attached at both the top and bottom of the vertical section. Like
the I-shaped receiver, the double Y-shaped receiver 30(1)' is sealed to capture the
water vapor upon heating and likewise features a condensate tube 36' placed inside.
An opening at the top of the receiver 30(1)' directs the clean water vapor to a vapor
tube coupled to an adjacent receiver.
[0049] As noted above, the distillation tube 36 extends through each of the receivers
30(1)-30(n) but is separate from the process water 52 circulating within each
receiver. The distillation tube 36 thus provides the outlet for the water vapor to
escape the distillation chamber of the receiver. This tube could be directed to a heat
exchanger where the incoming process water will pass over the tube to cool the
                                               8

  vapor so that water is formed and then collected into a purified water storage tank or
  pond. The distilled vapor in the condensate tube never intermingles with the process
 water.
  [0050] The condensate tube runs "counter current" to the flow within the receiver.
 The condensate tube is formed within the receiver so that the flow of the steam is in
 an opposite direction to the process water. This allows the water vapor to release its
  heat into the flow of the process water to advantageously increase the efficiency of
 the cycle as the heat contained in the water vapor is returned into the cycle.
 [0051]As noted above, the vacuum pump or system 72 may be used to lower the
 temperature at which water turns from a liquid into a vapor. A vacuum may also be
 applied to the port where the water vapor exits the receiver. The vacuum can be
 applied separately to each receiver or daisy chained in series. At the end of the
 vacuum line and before entering the vacuum pump 72, the condensate will enter a
 separator to remove the distilled water from the air column.
 [0052] As also noted above, a plurality of auxiliary heat sources 42(1)-42(n) may be
 positioned underneath the plurality of receivers 30(1)-30(n) to allow for low or no sun
 operation. The auxiliary heat sources 42(1)-42(n) may be gas burners, for example,
 and when ignited, provides a heat source on the receivers 30(1)-30(n) for the
 distillation process when solar conditions are not sufficient for the process to occur.
 [0053] The pump 70 moves the process water throughout the receivers 30(1)-30(n).
 The pump 70 includes controls to vary the flow rate of the process water 50. The
flow of the process water may be slowed so that a much larger percentage of the
 process water is vaporized. As a result, salt or containments remaining from the
evaporated process water accumulates to form a sludge in the last receiver 30(n)".
To force the sludge out of the last receiver 30(n)", an auger 100" is included therein.
The auger 100" forces the accumulated sludge out an exit port. The condensate
tube 36" runs through the center of the auger 100". A motor 102" coupled to the last
receiver 30(n)" drives the auger 100".
[0054] To further increase the efficiency of collecting and directing solar energy to
the receivers 30(1)-30(n), each solar panel 40(1) may comprise a plurality of tunable
solar collector panels carried by a base. Each solar collector panel may be tuned or
biased in terms of position so that the sun's radiation as reflected from each solar
collector panel is more accurately aligned on the focal line where the receiver 30(1)
is positioned so as to maximize the amount of energy received.
                                             9

  [0055] Collectively the solar collector panels may have a parabolic shape, and are
  separate from one another. Coupled to the solar collector panels are panel
  positioning devices. The panel positioning devices move the solar collector panels
  based on optical sensor devices that are used to determine alignment of the
  respective focal lines where the receivers are positioned so as to maximize the
  amount of energy received.
  [0056] Yet another feature of the above-described receivers 30(1)-30(n) is to position
  the metal receivers within within glass tube sections. The glass tube sections prevent
  heat from the metal receivers from escaping. Each glass tube section interfaces with
  an adjacent glass tube section via an expansion baffle. Metal seals at the ends of the
  glass tube sections are coupled to the expansion baffle. The expansion baffle allows
 for expansion and contraction of the metal seals so as to avoid breakage to the glass
 tube sections. A vacuum may also be pulled through the glass tube sections.
  [0057] Even though process water 50 is flowing through the receivers 30(1)-30(n), a
  heat transfer fluid (HTF) may be flowed instead, The heated HTF would then power
 a heat pump. The heat may then be fed to a multi-effect or multi-stage distillation
 system that evaporates the freshwater from the seawater or contaminated water.
 [0058]As an alternative to the condensate tube running "counter current" to the flow
 within the receivers, the condensate tube may run "co-current" to the flow within the
 receivers. The purified process water would exit the last receiver along with the
 process water out.
 [0059] Another aspect is directed to a method for processing process water 50 to
 purified process water 60 using the solar distillation system 20. From the start (Block
 202), the method comprises reflecting sunlight from the plurality of solar panels
 40(1)-40(n) to the plurality of receivers 30(1)-30(n) at Block 204. The process water
 50 is provided to the plurality of receivers 30(1)-30(n) at Block 206, with the process
water flowing from the first receiver 30(1) to the last receiver 30(n) and being heated
 by the reflected sunlight. Water vapor is generated at Block 208 within each receiver
as the process water 50 is heated. The water vapor flows via the respective vapor
tubes 32 between the adjacent receivers towards the last receiver 30(n). The water
vapor is provided from the return vapor tube 34 at the last receiver 30(n) to the
distillation tube 36 at Block 210. As the water vapor travels through the distillation
tube 36 the water vapor changes to a liquid, with the liquid being the purified process
water 60. The method ends at Block 212.
                                             10

  [0060] Another embodiment of a multi-effect solar distillation system 300 using a
 heat transfer fluid (HTF)      will now be discussed in reference to FIG. 10. The
  illustrated multi-effect solar distillation system 320 includes a plurality of receivers
  330(1)-330(n) and a plurality of solar panels 440(1)-440(n) adjacent the plurality of
 receivers. Each receiver is positioned within a focal point of a respective solar panel.
 Instead of heating the process water within the receivers 330(1)-330(n) as with the
 above embodiment, a heat transfer fluid (HTF) is heated. The HTF may be mineral
 oil or glycol, for example.
 [0061]An HTF storage 380 provides the HTF that flows through the receivers
 330(1)-330(n) to be heated. A pump 370 moves the HTF through the receivers
 30(1)-30(n), and includes controls to vary the flow rate of the HTF.
 [0062] The HTF is heated as it flows through each of the receivers 330(1)-330(n). As
 with the process water 50 above, the HTF is heated in stages, with each receiver
 corresponding to a stage. A multi-stage or multi-effect approach to heating the HTF
 is efficient since each stage essentially reuses the energy from a previous stage.
 [0063] At the last receiver 330(n), the heated HTF is provided to a heat exchanger
 382. The process water 350 is also provided to the heat exchanger 382 for
 conversion to steam. The heat exchanger 382 may be a flash heat exchanger, for
example, where the heated HTF is routed through a grid. The process water 350 is
then splashed or sprayed onto the grid, which then turns to water vapor and/or
steam. This type of heat exchanger 382 is also known as a flash exchanger, as
readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. The process water 350 does not come
in contact with the HTF.
[0064] The steam generated by the HTF heat exchanger 382 is directed to the
distillation tube 336. The distillation tube 336 extends through each of the receivers
330(1)-330(n) but is separate from the HTF circulating within each receiver. The HTF
provided at the output of the heat exchanger 382 is recirculated back to the HTF
storage 380.
[0065] As the steam travels through the distillation tube 336, it changes phases back
to a liquid. The heat given off during this phase change is provided to each
respective stage, thus further increasing the efficiency of the illustrated multi-effect
solar distillation system 320. An output of the distillation tube 336 provides the
purified process water 360.

 [0066] The distillation tube 336 is in contact with the HTF circulating within each
 receiver. The HTF advantageously allows heat to be given off as the water vapor
 changes phases back to a liquid, help lower the boiling temperature of the HTF as
 well as]
 [0067] The multi-effect solar distillation system 320 may include a vacuum pump or
 system 372 coupled to the distillation tube 336 to provide direction to the flow of the
 water vapor. In addition, a plurality of auxiliary heat sources 342(1)-342(n) may be
 positioned adjacent the plurality of receivers 330(1)-330(n) to allow for low or no sun
 operation. The auxiliary heat sources 342(1)-342(n) may be gas burners, for
 example.
 [0068] The distillation (i.e., condensation) tube 336 runs "counter current" to the flow
 within the receiver. The condensate tube is formed within the receiver so that the
flow of the steam is in an opposite direction to the HTF. This allows the water vapor
to release its heat into the flow of the HTF to advantageously increase the efficiency
of the cycle as the heat contained in the water vapor is returned into the cycle.
 [0069] The auxiliary heat sources 342(1)-342(n) may be gas burners, for example,
and when ignited, provides a heat source on the receivers 330(1)-330(n) for the
distillation process when solar conditions are not sufficient for the process to occur.

foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is understood that
the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed, and that
