     "Core Sample Orientation"
     Field of the Invention
     This invention relates to core sample orientation. More particularly, the invention
     relates to an orientation device for providing an indication of the orientation of a
  5  core sample relative to a body of material from which the core has been extracted,
     and also to a method of core sample orientation identification.
     Background Art
     There is a need for core sampling in geological surveying operations,
     Core samples are obtained through core drilling operations.          Core drilling is
 10 typically conducted with a core drill comprising outer and inner tube assemblies.
    A cutting head is attached to the outer tulse assembly, so that rotational torque
     applied to the outer tube assembly is transmitted to the cutting head. A core is
    generated during the drilling operation, with the core progressively extending
    along the inner tube assembly as drilling progresses. When a core sample is
 15 acquired, the core within the inner tube assembly is fractured. The inner tube
    assembly and the fractured core sample contained therein, are then retrieved
    from within the drill hole, typically by way of a retrieval cable lowered down the
    drill hole. Once the inner tube assembly has been brought to ground surface, the
    core sample can be removed and subjected to the necessary analysis.
20  Typically, the core drilling operation is performed at an angle to the vertical, and it
    is desirable for analysis purposes to have an indication of the orientation of the
    core sample relative to the ground from which it was extracted.        it is therefore
    important that there be some means of identifying the orientation the core sample
    had within the ground prior to it having been brought to the surface.
25  Core orientation devices are used to provide an indication of the orientation of the
    core sample.

       One common way of obtaining an indication of the orientation of a core sample is
      through use of an orientation spear comprising a marker (such as a crayon)
      projecting from one end of a thin steel shank, the other end of which is attached to
      a wire line.
  5   The orientation spear is lowered down the drill hole, prior to the inner tube
      assembly being introduced.       The marker on the orientation spear strikes the
      facing surface of material from which the core is to be generated, leaving a mark
     thereon, Because of gravity, the mark is on the lower side of the drill hole. The
     i6ner tube assembly is then introduced into the outer tube assembly in the drill
 10   hole.   As drilling proceeds, a core sample is generated within the inner tube
     assembly, The core sample so generated carries the mark which was previously
     applied, Upon completion of the core drilling run and retrieval of the core sample,
     the mark provides an indication of the orientation of the core sample at the time it
     was in the ground.
 15  There are also mechanical core orientation devices for marking a core sample
     prior to its extraction from the drill hole.    Typically, mechanical devices are
     adapted to be incorporated in the inner tube assembly for marking the core. An
    example of such a mechanical orientation device is disclosed in WO 03/038212.
     It is against this background and the problems and difficulties associated
20  therewith that the present invention has been developed.

    Best Mode(s) for Carrying Out the Invention
    Referring to Figure 1 there is shown a core orientation device 10 for a core drill
    12.   The device 10 comprises an arrangement 14 for providing signals 16
20  associated with a physical orientation of the core orientation device 10. According
    to the embodiment the physical orientation of the core orientation device 10
    comprises rotational orientation 18 about a longitudinal axis 20 of the core
    orientation device 10.
    The core orientation device 10 includes processing means 22 for processing the
25  signals 16 provided by the arrangement 14 so as to provide processed data 23

                                                 41
       from which a measure 24 of the rotational orientation 18 of the core orientation
       device 10 can be established. The measure 24 is associated with the rotational
       orientation 18 of the device 10 at a particular moment in time.
       A memory 26 is coupled to the processing means 22 for storing the processed
   5   data 23. To this end there is provided an interface means 27 comprising first
       means 28 for storing the processed data 23 processed by the processing means
       22 in the memory 26 and second means 30 for accessing the memory 26 to
       provide the measure 24 of the rotational orientation 18 of core orientation device
       10. This allows the measure 24 to be obtained when required.
 10   As shown in Figure 2 the core drill 12 comprises an outer tube assembly 34 and
      an inner tube assembly 36 of generally conventional construction.
      The orientation device 10 according to the embodiment is accommodated along
      the length 38 of the inner tube assembly 36, as shown in Figure 2 of the drawings.
      In this arrangement the inner tube assembly 36 comprises upper and lower parts
 15   36a, 36b between which the orientation device 10 is fitted. The upper part 36a
      includes a bearing 40, with the portion above the bearing 40 being rotatable with
      the outer tube assembly 34 and the portion below the bearing 40 being restrained
      against rotation because of frictional engagement with the core being generated.
     Thus, in this manner the bearing 40 allows the core orientation device 10 to rotate
20   relative to the outer tube assembly 34 but not relative to the core sample when the
     core is received,
     incorporating the orientation device 10 in the inner tube assembly 36 increases
     the overall length of the inner tube assembly 36, a consequence of which is that
     the overall length of the outer tube assembly 34 needs to also be increased. A
25   spacer 42 is provided in the outer tube assembly 34 for this purpose. Apart from
     modifications to the inner tube assembly 36 to accommodate the orientation tool
     10, and also the spacer 42 provided in the outer tube assembly 36, the core drill
     12 is of conventional construction and operates in a conventional way.

                                             - 12
      Referring to Figure 3 it can be seen that the inner tube assembly 36 comprises a
      back end assembly 33, a replacement grease sub 35, the core orientation device
      10, 3m of inner tube 37 and core Ufter case 39.
     As shown in Figure 4, the orientation device 10 comprises a housing 44 of
  5  generally cylindrical construction thereby defining the central longitudinal axis 20.
     The housing 44 has a generally cylindrical side wall 46 and two opposed ends 48,
     50. The end 48 is open and internally threaded to provide a female threaded
     formation (not shown).       A male threaded formation 52 is provided on the
     cylindrical side 46 of the housing 40 inwardly spaced from the other end 50.
 10  The female threaded formation (not shown) and the male threaded formation 52
     are provided so that the orientation device 10 can be installed between, and in
     threaded engagement with, the upper and lower parts 36a, 36b of the inner tube
     assembly 36, as shown In Figure 2. The inner tube assembly 36 accordingly has
     complementary threaded portions (not shown) which provide means for
 15  accommodating the core orientation device 10 along the length of the inner tube
     assembly 36.
    The housing 44 accommodates an internal chassis 54.
    The chassis 54 has a cavity 56 which accommodates shock absorbing material 57
    encasing a triaxlal accelerometer means 58.
20  The shock absorbing material 57 comprises several layers of cushioning.
    Specifically, there is an outer cushioning layer, an intermediate cushioning layer,
    and an inner cushioning layer which embraces the triaxial accelerometer means
    58, with the robustness of cushioning progressively decreasing from the outer
    layer to the inner layer,
25  As shown in Figure 5, the housing 44 also accommodates a main printed circuit
    board 60 and an electrical power source 62 in the form of a lithium battery pack.
    The processing means 22 comprises an electronic circuit with chip on the main
    printed circuit board 60. The processing means 22 incorporates an analogue-to-

                                             - 13
      digital converter 64, a low-power microcontroller 66 which provides a processor, a
      timer 68 and non-volatile memory 70, as illustrated schematically in Figure 6.
      Thus in this embodiment the memory 26 forms part of the processing means 22.
      The interface means 27 forms part of the processing means 22 while having the
  5  first means 28 for storing the processed data 23 and second means 30 for
      accessing the memory 26 to provide the measure 24 of the rotational orientation
      18 of core orientation device 10 at the associated time. A watchdog circuit 71 is
      provided for watching the system. In instances where the device 10 shuts down
     downhole it can be reset at the surface.
 10  The     triaxial accelerometer   means     58  comprises    three  internal   silicon
     accelerometers operating along orthogonal directions X, Y and Z,         The three
     accelerometers measure components of the earth's gravitational field.
     Mathematically transforming the outputs from the three accelerometers allows the
     rotational orientation 18 of the device 10 about its longitudinal axis 20 to be
 15 determined.
    More particularly, the signals 16 produced by the triaxial accelerometer means 43
    are determinative of the change in orientation of the device 10 and are transmitted
    to the analogue-to-digital converter 64 which in turn transmits signals or signal
    data, to the microcontroller 66.
20  The timer 68 is provided for ensuring that the processing means processes
    signals from the arrangement over predetermined time intervals.              In this
    arrangement the processor means 22 includes integration means for integrating
    signals over a particular predetermined time interval of 1 minute.
    When orientation device 10 is operating, the relative orientation of the device is
25  determined at regular intervals as determined by processing means 22.            The
    processing means 22 employs the interface means 27 and second means 30 to
    store the processed data 23 in memory 26. In this embodiment, the time intervals
    at which the orientation is determined and stored comprises intervals of one

                                                  ~14~
        minute, In this way, there is a stored record of the orientation of the device 10 at
        minute intervals.     The orientation of the orientation device 10 of course
        corresponds to the orientation of the lower part 36b of the inner tube assembly 3
       which in turn corresponds to the orientation of a core sample progressively
   5   entering the inner tube assembly 36, as the lower part 36b does not rotate relative
       to the core sample.
       The following process occurs in the operation of the core orientation device 10
       and the core drill 12. A first step comprises moving the core drill 12 having the
       core orientation device 12 forming part thereof from a first location to a drilling
 10    location. After this the core drill 12 is operated to drill a core sample.
      While the core drill is moved from the first location to the drilling location the core
      orientation device 10 generates acceleration signals 16 associated with the
      rotational orientation 18 of a core orientation device 10. The processing means
      22 then processes the signals 16 to provide processed data 23 from which the
 15   measure 24 of rotational orientation 18 of the device 10 at the drilling location can
      be established. The processed data 23 is stored in memory 26 for later recall
      such that the measure 23 of the rotational orientation 18 of the device 10 can be
      obtained therefrom.
      By using integration means and time intervals of one minute the processed data
20    23 is indicative of the change orientation of the device 10 in one minute intervals
      commencing from a reference time that corresponds to the time at which the
      orientation device 10 was started.
     As shown in Figure 6, the core orientation device includes a membrane keypad 72
     and an LCD display 74, both of which are provided at end 50 of the orientation
25   device 10. With this arrangement, the keypad 72 is accessible for operation from
     the end 50 and the display 74 is also visible from that end, but of course only
     when the orientation device 10 is not connected to upper part 36a of the inner
     tube assembly 36. The keypad 72 incorporates a window section 76 through
     which the LCD display 74 is visible.           The keypad 72 has four keys in this
30   embodiment, identified in Figure 4 as"N", "R", "+"and "-"keys.

                                               - 15
      As will be appreciated the membrane keypad 72 and 74 are protected by the inner
      tube assembly 36 when accommodated in the female threaded portion (not
      shown).
      In this embodiment, the orientation device 10 is started by pressing the "N"key on
  5   the keypad 72. It is also necessary to record the time duration between starting
      the core orientation device 10 and extracting the core sample. Typically this is
      achieved by starting an external        stop watch at the time of starting of the
      orientation device 10. Other arrangements are of course possible.
      The stop watch is started at the time that the orientation device 10 displays a
 10   signal on the display 31 indicating that operation of the orientation device 10 has
      started. This provides for added accuracy.
      Once the orientation device 10 has been started and recording of the subsequent
     time duration commenced, the inner tube assembly 36 is inserted into a drill hole
     for reception in the outer tube assembly 13, and the core drilling operation
15   commenced.      During the drilling operation, a core is progressively generated
     within the inner tube assembly, as previous explained.
     When the core is to be extracted, the core drill operator refers to the timer and
     notes the time duration involved. Specifically, the operator either notes the full
     minute that has previously elapsed or waits until the next full minute elapses, and
20   then records that time (as it must be recalled later). The operator then initiates
     the procedure for breaking the core from the body of material, ensuring that no
     rotation of the inner tube assembly 36 occurs. The inner tube assembly 36 is
     retrieved from the drill hole in the conventional manner.
    At the surface, the upper part 36a of the inner tube assembly 36 is unscrewed
25  from the orientation device 10, so as to the expose the end 50 thereof to provide
    access to the keypad 72 and display 74. As previously described the frictional
    engagement of the core and the inner tube assembly 36b along with bearing 40
    allows the lower part 36b to rotate relative to the outer tube assembly 34 but not
    relative to the core sample.

                                                -16
       As will be described the device 10 includes means 80 for relating the measure of
       the orientation of the core orientation device 10 with the current rotational
       orientation thereof. This allows for the core orientation device to consequently be
       rotated to reflect the measure of the orientation of the core orientation device. in
   5   this embodiment this is achieved by inputting the time duration as measured by
       the external stop watch into the the orientation device 10 through the keypad 72.
       This is done by pressing the "R" key to display numbers "00" and then pressing
       the +]- keys to display the relevant time duration in minutes.
       Once the time has been entered, the key "R" is pressed once. This causes the
 10    means 80 for relating the core orientation device to the current rotational
       orientation thereof, to determine a current rotational orientation 81 from
       processing means 22 and display a graphical indication 83 of the direction in
      which the orientation device 10 and the lower part 36b of the inner tube assembly
      36 attached thereto should be rotated. Rotating the device and lower part 36b in
 15   this direction causes the core contained within the inner tube assembly 36b to
      move into an orientation corresponding to its orientation at the time that it was in
      the ground before extraction,      At this time a symbol 85 is displayed to alert the
      operator.
      Once the required orientation has been established, the core sample within the
20    inner tube assembly 36 can be marked as necessary. After removal of the core
      sample from the lower part 36b of the inner tube assembly 36, the upper part 36a
      can be fitted onto the orientation device 10 and the inner tube assembly 36 used
     for the next core sample drilling stage.
     The process by which the orientation device 10 determines and provides a
25   graphical indication of the direction in which it should be rotated, together with the
     lower part 15b of the inner tube assembly 36 attached thereto, in order to be at an
     orientation corresponding to the orientation of the core sample in its original
     position within the ground, operates on the following basis. The time
     measurement measured by the operator and entered into the keypad 72
30   represents the duration of time between starting the orientation device 10 and the
     point at which the particular drilling process was terminated in order to fracture the

                                              ~17
      core sample from the body of material to which it is attached so that the core
      sample could be retrieved from the drill hole and brought to surface level,
      As previously explained, the orientation of the orientation device 10 is determined
      at predetermined intervals, which are minute intervals in this embodiment. The
  5   timer simply allows identification of the particular minute interval at which the
      appropriate orientation reading was taken and recorded.
      Inputting the time measurement into the keypad 72 allows the controller 66 to
      compare the inputted reading to the various stored readings and identify the
      relevant orientation reading.     The triaxial accelerometer means 58 provides
 10   signals responsive to the orientation of the orientation device 10 at any instant in
     time, including when operating at surface level. Such signals allow the controller
      66 to process the signals and determine the orientation of the device at any
     instant. The controller 53 can compare the instant of the device at surface level at
     any instant in time to the particular recorded reading corresponding to the
15   orientation of the device at the time that the core sample was separated from the
     body of material to which it was previously attached.           This comparison is
     processed to provide data which is outputted to the display 74 to provide a visual
     indication of the direction in which the orientation device should be rotated, as
     previously explained.
20   In this embodiment, the visual indication comprises a directional arrow
     arrangement showing the required rotational direction.         Once the orientation
     device 10 is at the required orientation, the display 74 provides an image 85
     representing that condition.
     From the forgoing, it is evident that the present invention provides an orientation
25  device which does not require physical marking of a core sample prior to
    extraction thereof from the ground. Indeed, the orientation device according to
    the embodiment is particularly convenient for an operator to use.          All that is
    required is for the operator to start the orientation device prior to the inner tube
    assembly 36 being inserted into the drill hole, and contemporaneously start a

                                             - 18
timer for recording the time duration before the drilling operation ceases to allow the
generated core sample to be retrieved.
Modifications and improvements may be made without departing from the scope of
the invention. For example in other embodiment the physical orientation does not
comprise a rotational orientation but rather a measure of degrees above or below the
horizontal plane.
The present disclosure is provided to explain in an enabling fashion the best modes
of making and using various embodiments in accordance with the present invention.
