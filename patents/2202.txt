                                 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   [0001]    The instant invention is directed generally to devices used by surgeons primarily
   to embed in bone and to repair fractures. More specifically, the instant invention includes
   a fastener capable of rotation about an axis that is fashioned to, inter alia, resist working
   loose and reduce insertion torque, thereby providing both tactile feedback to the surgeon
   and minimize trauma at the fastening site by controlling heat buildup due to friction. The
   fastener reduces insertion (cutting) pressure and increases fastener tracking, thereby
   minimizing problems associated with misalignment.

WO 2014/031884                                                                 PCT/US2013/056248
                             BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   [0002]    Surgical procedures involving fasteners on skeletal structure presently suffer
   from several common frailties.       One is the inability to accurately orient the fastener
   during insertion to keep the fastener from wandering. Bone interiors have a sponge like
   (cancellous) texture.  Even with a predrilled pilot hole, fasteners still frequently skew off
   the axis of the pilot hole, making it difficult to register the fastener at its distal end with
   another instrumentality.
   [0003]    Another frailty is the failure to provide a reliable thread portion that engages the
   bone of the patient in a manner which retards its working loose.        Bone is a remarkable
   structure which varies both in hardness and elasticity as a function of both age and
   location. Loads on the fastener must accommodate not only these constraints but also the
   dynamics of forces generated by the patient in daily activities.
   [0004]    The buttress thread is presently the industry standard. Unfortunately, buttress
   threads are suitable for use only where load forces on the fastener are applied in one
   direction. (Bhandari, Design of Machine Elements (2007), page 204). Where the load
   forces are multidirectional or not unidirectional and axial, failure can occur.            One
   manifestation of buttress thread failure is "toggling" where the fastener works on the bone
   and enlarges the hole within which the fastener resides.
   [0005]    Yet another frailty related to high insert torque makes it impossible to insert the
   screw through bone fragments without it grabbing the fragment and causing it to rotate
   with the screw causing significant trauma to soft tissues and a failed fixation of the
   fragment.
   [0006]    In an attempt to offset the multiple problems of buttress threads, it is common
   practice to design the buttress thread profile to increase retention by increasing friction.
   Increased friction leads to elevated temperatures during insertion, potentially damaging
                                               3

WO 2014/031884                                                                PCT/US2013/056248
   bone tissue.   A temperature excursion greater than 116 degrees Fahrenheit (47 degrees
   Celsius) at the insertion site causes osteonecrosis which cannot be repaired and which the
   body cannot heal.     And, even worse, excess heat compromises the fastener's ability to
   remain in place since the bone has died at the screw thread interface. As a consequence,
   some procedures rely on liquid cooling at the site during the drilling/insertion procedure,
   but, even then, the process generates so much heat that the heat generating tool can be too
   hot to touch because the liquid cooling is merely topical.
   [0007]     Since the only variables (thread pitch, crest and root diameters) in the buttress
   thread design are interrelated, improving       retention increases friction and    insertion
   torque, resulting in heat generation and impairing the surgeon's ability to feel the
   insertion torque of the fastener in a meaningful way.      This still leaves the fundamental
   problem of the thread's inability to withstand multidirectional forces unaddressed, while
   creating several new problems.
   [0008]    The surgeon has no tactile feedback when inserting the fastener.       The buttress
   fastener is harder to start and is prone to stripping, especially when used in conjunction
   with a plate. The buttress thread induces a radial force, perpendicular to the fastener's
   long axis, which increases the probability the bone will split or crack, making a procedure
   much more difficult, if not impossible. The buttress threaded fastener can wander during
   insertion, making its registry with an instrumentality at the distal end of the fastener a
   recurring problem.     Wandering away from the pilot hole often results in cutting new
   threads in an unintended location or stripping out the pilot hole which retards healing and
   actually induces trauma; and, where there is a temperature excursion above 116 degrees
   Fahrenheit, it can also cause osteonecrosis of the adjacent bone.
   [0009]    The present invention's thread geometry minimizes insertion force. This allows
   the surgeon tactile feedback and reduces the effort required to deploy the fastener. This,
                                              4

WO 2014/031884                                                                 PCT/US2013/056248
   in conjunction with a forward chip feeder, a centering pilot, and improved thread cutting
   features keep friction low, the fastener aligned and directed from wandering away from
   the preferred path.
   [0010]    The distal end of many fasteners includes a relief area (flute) designed to help
   cut through bone, defining a "self-tapping" fastener.         Buttress thread fastener's self
   tapping features a flute that is straight or at least close to in-line with the axis of the
   screw. That is, as the fastener is advanced, the cutting edges send the bone chip towards
   the head of the fastener which is into the path of the helical threads.       This bone debris
   accumulates along the thread teeth and increases insertion torque and friction which
   therefore generate additional heat. The debris also makes the fastener harder to insert and
   provides a poor interface with the bone and the fastener.
   [0011]    In the present invention, the cut chips curl away from the cutting edges and are
   fed forward into the predrilled pilot hole in advance of the fastener because the flute is
   "left handed" on a right handed threaded screw.         That is, as the fastener advances, the
   flute forces the chips forward into the pilot hole ahead of the screw. This results in exact
   clearance between the fastener and the portion of the bone being formed as "bone teeth"
   (that portion which engages the threaded fastener).       The interface between the bone and
   fastener is therefore substantially free of the cuttings and provides healthier bone tissue
   adjacent the fastener to prevent additional trauma to the bone.
   [0012]    Another problem associated with buttress style threads is that the area between
   threads of the fastener is the only site of anchoring in the bone, and because of the design
   constraints associated therewith, this site is difficult to optimize. Stated alternatively, the
   metal of the fastener is orders of magnitude stronger than the retaining bone so that when
   failure occurs, it always involves bone trauma.
                                              5

   [0013]    The present invention maximizes the bone being engaged while minimizing the
   fastener's thread, something impossible to do with a buttress thread and other common
   threads and common manufacturing processes. The result is less bone trauma and less
   bone removed to increase bone strength to retain the fastener better.
   [0014]    This invention discards conventional thinking and manufacturing processes in
   the pursuit of new and desirable functions that can be achieved from the thread profile.
   [0015]    Heretofore manufacturers have adopted a simple and very fast manufacturing
   process that produce screws that function no better than common wood screws.

WO 2014/031884                                                               PCT/US2013/056248
                           BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   [0016]     The instant invention addresses various skeletal components with fasteners in
   ways heretofore unattainable with an improved thread pattern which provides greater
   retention of bone structure and minimal damage to bone adjacent the fastener.
   [0017]     This invention produces a bone screw thread design that can be modified in
   many independent ways to produce different capabilities and functions that can contribute
   to better grip, greater resistance to pull-out, lower cutting and insertion pressure which
   reduces site temperature and causes less damage to the bone in the process. These
   features provide better feel for the surgeon installing the screws to prevent stripped
   threads, better clamping force, better fixation, and ultimately shorter healing time.
   [0018]     A new manufacturing process is disclosed which utilizes single-point threading
   in conjunction with multiple form cutting tools with different shapes and following
   different paths to create      thread features   formed by independently       programmable
   successive cutting moves, each distinct from the others. This means that the tooth height,
   thickness and spacing can now each be modified independently to produce different
   characteristics and capabilities to greatly improve both the procedure when the screw is
   installed into the bone and the performance of the screw in situ.
   [0019]     While the method that is being disclosed forms threads of greater complexity in
   the process, in a production setting it is only possible because of CNC machine tools and
   the ability to program sequential, independent cutting moves to create unique features
   unknown in the prior art.
   [0020]     Bone fixation is very complicated because the breaks are found in an infinite
   variety of shapes and locations. Fasteners embedded in bone need to minimize bone
   trauma and removal while maximizing retention in a dynamic environment. The benefits
                                              7

   derived from these new thread designs and a method to produce them will be very
   significant to the industry and patients.

                        DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
   [0050]     Considering the drawings, wherein like reference numerals denote like parts
   throughout the various drawing figures, reference numeral 100 is directed to the
   orthopedic stabilization fastener according to the present invention.
   [0051]     The features of the screw threads in FIG. 1 include: the head 2 (defining a
   proximal end) of the screw is comprised of radii 9 and 10 converging at apex 11 to form
   the outside diameter of the head 2. The head 2 may include a lower wall 6 which defines
   an abutment surface so that, when the fastener 100 is fully installed, the abutment surface
   6 bears against a supporting surface (e.g. patient's body or plate) and induces the
   compressive load 5 shown in FIG. 11. As load 5 in induced, centering points 36 FIG. 11
   of screw teeth 24 are loaded against the bottom centering points 37 of bone teeth 25
   which prevents radial inward or outward forces 3 from axis 16 of the screw. Likewise,
   load vector 1 FIG. 11 induces screw centering point 38 against bone centering point 39.
   If the fastener is to be countersunk, the apex diameter 11 of the fastener 100 approximates
   the major thread (crest) diameter 17 and the compressive load 5 is then caused by
   interference fit relying on a thread portion immediately adjacent the head 2.
   [0052]     More specifically, the last turn of the thread 12 (nearest head 2) either has both a
   different pitch and/or tooth thickness which provides resistive clamping. Up until this
   abutment, the fastener is substantially free turning due to low friction geometry. This
   provides tactile feedback to the surgeon. Right hand threads 12 are helically wound along
   shaft 13 to produce the thread pitch. The distal end 4 of the screw features a pilot 59
   incorporating chip dispersing flutes 55 having a left-handed spiral orientation.
   [0053]     Fig. 4 shows the internal Hex drive socket 35 at the proximal end of the screw.
   Fig. 2 depicts a cross section 9 of the threaded portion of the screw shaft with an axis 16
   passing through core of the shaft.

   [0054]    Thread 24 extends away from thread root 18 (shaft exterior 13) defining the
   major thread diameter 17. Bone tooth 25 is formed by the boundaries of thread root 18,
   screw thread tooth 24 and screw thread 26. The thread root 18 (shaft exterior 13) defines
   a substantially continuous cylindrical wall, helically spiraling between the shaft threads
   and interrupted only by the helically wound threads 12.

   screw threads 30 coupled with the improved cutting edges of the screw teeth 51 (FIG. 8,
   and 10) created by the left hand concave spiral chip dispersing flute 55 (FIG. 1, 4, 8, and
   10) determine the cutting and insertion torque of the screw. This is an important and
   significant improvement as it provides the surgeon with a desired tactile interpretation of
   the interface with the bone. This also helps the surgeon determine how tight the screw is
   and how much load is actually being applied for compression. Current technologies
   require so much torque to install a fastener that the surgeon can barely tell what is really
   happening. This often results in stripped threads or loose screws.
   [0056]    Another key feature of this new thread profile in Fig. 3 is the manufacturing
   method with the options to easily change the outward protrusion 32 of the screw thread
   teeth, the spacing 34 between adjacent teeth which determines the dimension ("volume")
   of the bone tooth 25, and the thickness 30 of the screw thread teeth.
   [0057]    The dimension (volume) of the bone tooth 25 is a very important issue because
   the metal screw thread is significantly stronger than the bone. By having the ability to
   create a more equal strength balance between the two, it is now possible to provide a
   screw to bone interface that can accomplish a much better and more stable grip in the
   bone.
   [0058]    By increasing the screw thread protrusion 32 it is possible to produce a screw
   thread that can have increased purchase in less dense bone. By reducing the bone tooth
                                            15

WO 2014/031884                                                                 PCT/US2013/056248
   width 34 of the bone tooth 25, it is possible to create a smaller pitch for better purchase in
   bone with a very thin cortical wall, yet at the same time maximize cancellous bone tooth
   dimensions that require wider bone teeth 25 and greater outward protrusion of screw teeth
   32. In all prior threads wherein common tooth profiles have been created by a single point
   cutting or rolling tool it was not possible to have these options.
   [0059]     The step shown in Fig. 5, for this new manufacturing method of multiple cutting
   tools for material removal teaches that a special form cutting tool 40 creates screw thread
   facets 42, 44, and root 46.
   [0060]     The step shown in Fig. 6, for this new manufacturing method of multiple cutting
   tools for material removal teaches that a special form cutting tool 41 creates screw thread
   facets 43, and additional root 45.
   [0061]     The step shown in Fig. 7, for this new manufacturing method of multiple cutting
   tools for material removal teaches that a special form cutting tool 47 creates screw thread
   facets 48, and additional root 49. The FIG. 5 and 6 steps occur with relative rotation in
   one direction; FIG. 7 step is counter rotated.
   [0062]     The significance of roots 45, 46 and 49 is that these surfaces define a
   substantially wide cylindrical wall which helically spirals along the fastener, interrupted
   only by the interlocking teeth, so that, bending forces experienced by the fastener are
   distributed along these roots and therefore also along the bone teeth in tangential registry
   therewith to prevent any motion because of the increased surface area which is devoid of
   any sharp surfaces which would otherwise define pressure points-as in the prior art.
   [0063]     FIG. 9 illustrates the benefits of this three step cutting process when compared
   with a buttress thread.     As shown, two thread profiles are shown with their pitches in
   registry. One buttress thread is superposed over one thread of the present invention. As
   shown, the buttress thread removes at least one third more bone in this depiction, but it
                                              16

WO 2014/031884                                                              PCT/US2013/056248
   should be pointed out that the thickness 30 (FIG. 3) of the present invention's thread
   could be reduced to the thickness of a thin blade when the appropriate material has been
   chosen for the fastener.     When the thickness 30 has been optimized (minimized), a
   maximum volume of bone tooth is available for maximum grip and minimum trauma
   while reducing friction and insertion force.
   [0064]    Yet another significant feature of this invention is the mechanical interlocking
   capability of this thread profile. In essence the bone thread tooth 25 is interlocked
   between screw threads 24 and 26. This is illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 11. Reaction forces,
   responding to the load 5 induced upon tightening, are distributed along the various
   facets/flanks of the fastener. As shown, forces are centered, screw flanks are interlocked
   with bone teeth 25 surfaces and centering points 36, 37, 38, 39 at the juncture of flanks
   cooperate to prevent strain and resist spreading in either axial load or torsional load.
   Specifically, flanks 19 and 20, 21 and 22, 22 and 23 operate in pairs such that the
   intersection  of the pairs    define centering points    for load distribution   and force
   equalization.
   [0065]    Note the screw tooth facet 20 is at a lesser angle from axis 16 than screw thread
   facet 21, This means that bone screw tooth 25 becomes trapped "inboard" (between the
   apex 36 (FIG. 11) formed at the juncture of facet 22 and 23 on one side, and thread root
   18 and screw thread facets 20 on the other side). This produces an instant mechanical
   interlock between the fastener screw threads 24, and 26 along thread 12, and the bone
   thread tooth 25. The significance of this feature has far reaching value. In bone it is best
   to produce an interface that is neither radial spreading nor radial drawing when the screw
   is tightened to reduce trauma to the bone.
   [0066]    Current bone screw threads create harmful compressive loads that can crack the
   bone or at least compress the living bone excessively adding to the trauma. In the present
                                             17

WO 2014/031884                                                               PCT/US2013/056248
   invention, these problems are resolved. Here, the relationship of the teeth facets (flanks)
   19 and 20 can be "adjusted" (dimensionally changed) relative to facets (flanks) 21, 22 and
   23 to alter fastener tooth thickness 30 and separation between adjacent teeth via
   modifying the bone tooth gap 34, for example, to provide maximum bone engagement
   and optimize compression pressure for the entrained bone located between fastener teeth.
   [0067]    This invention with its improved cutting edges, chip removal, reduced tooth
   width and less bone removed produces new interface characteristics with the bone while
   providing the surgeon with the best possible feel during the initial threading and
   torqueing sequence.
   [0068]    FIGS. 8 and 10 show pilot 59 with the concave spiral chip dispersing flute 55
   that angles from the axis of screw 100 at an approximately 450, (reference numeral 52).
   Chip dispersing flute has a portion which opens through the outside diameter of pilot 59
   and extends in a left handed helical transition a short distance (1 or more threads) towards
   the proximal end of the screw. The chip dispersing flute gently transitions into shaft 13
   and threads 12. The actual cutting of chips are caused by sharp leading cutting edges 51
   formed by the left handed helical chip dispensing flute 55 and having slightly blunted
   trailing cutting edges 53. The concave radius of flute 55 thus produces a sharp leading
   cutting edge 51 at the intersection of threads 12 and flute 55 at the major diameter of
   threads 12. Eccentric radial relief edges 62 combine with sharp edges 51 to approximate a
   talon-like contour wherein the major diameter decreases in diameter as it trails away from
   edges 51 to provide leading edges that can easily cut the bone producing chips that curl
   from the cutting edges and transition out of the concave chip dispersing flute.         Said
   eccentric relief gradually reduces the height of threads 12 until interrupted by a next left
   hand flute where upon the eccentric relief starts again at the major diameter of the next
                                             18

WO 2014/031884                                                                PCT/US2013/056248
   helical thread 12 as it continues on the opposite side of the second left hand flute and
   concludes at a decreased height as it ends back at the left hand side of the next flute.
   [0069]     FIG. 12 reveals how eccentric radial relief 62 is formed by a special cutter 200
   turning in a clockwise direction as the screw is rotated in a counter clockwise direction as
   it slowly moves downward 77 to form eccentric reliefs 62. The cutting end of the cutter is
   shaped at an angle 76 to cut a slight taper on the outside diameter of threads 12 extending
   from the distal end of the threads upwards towards the proximal end to coincide with the
   length of the chip dispersal flute 55.
   [0070]     This is illustrated in FIG. 13 as a cross section of the "talon" shaped thread
   cutting profile produced by the combination of flute 55 creating the sharp cutting tip 51
   and eccentric relief 62 by rotating cutter 200 while it moves in a downward direction 77
   until it reaches the back edge of the next flute 55. At this point the cutter 200 moves
   upward to start the same process again at the beginning edges of the next side of flute 55
   and continuing this process until the cutter has completed a 3600 rotation and all distal
   threads have been treated by cutter 200 with eccentric radial reliefs 62 .
   [0071]     These features combine to cut clean threads and move the chips along chip path
   57 pushing them forward through the drilled pilot hole ahead of the advancing screw as it
   is helically turned into the bone. The leading edge 61 of the transition of flute 55 and root
   13 produces a precision fit within the inside diameter of the drilled pilot hole to provide a
   positive chip removal scraping action as screw 100 turns inside the drilled pilot hole. This
   scraping action forces the chips down and out of the precision fit of the pilot inside the
   drilled hole. The benefit here is that the leading edges 51 cause the chips to curl forward
   and follow the contour of the flute 55 forward, and out the end of chip path 57 away from
   the path of the advancing threads.

WO 2014/031884                                                                PCT/US2013/056248
   [0072]    Stated alternatively, as the fastener is inserted clockwise CW (FIGS. 4, 8 and
   10), the leading cutting edges 51 progressively shave thin ribbons of bone, advancing
   them forward and pushed by the leading edge 61 in the direction 57. This creates a true
   self tapping screw and also prevents the chips from being drawn into the advancing screw
   threads and the bone. This results in much lower cutting pressure, cleaner threads and less
   damage to the bone. (If the chips can't get out of the way they get drawn into the path of
   the threads and get crushed into the surrounding bone. If this happens, the trapped chips
   can kick off an inflammation process resulting in the immune system attacking the chips
   as foreign bodies with eventual absorption, causing voids next to the threads eventually
   resulting in loosening of the screw threads 12.)      FIG. 16 shows a cutter and pilot for a
   dual start, dual thread fastener.
   [0073]    The pilot 59 has a substantially circular, planar, distal end 4 interrupted by
   portions of the chip dispensing flutes 55 shown in the drawings.         More or fewer chip
   dispensing flutes 55 can be provided so long as they are symmetrically oriented along the
   periphery.   A marginal periphery 60 provides a radiused transition between the planar
   distal end 4 and the cylindrical shaft 13. This radiused transition forces the fastener 100
   to remain in the predrilled pilot hole, thereby assuring registry of the fastener 100 with
   another surgical instrumentality (such as a plate) on the distal end of the fastener.
   [0074]    In use, preferably a pilot hole is predrilled and the fastener 100 is oriented there
   over. The radius 60 of the pilot 59 nests within the predrilled pilot hole. Advancement of
   the fastener by clockwise rotation (CW) causes the chip dispensing flutes 55 and their
   leading (left handed) cutting edges 51 to incrementally shave bone shards away from the
   fastener, with leading edge 61 pushing the shards forward into the concavity and forward
   into the predrilled hole along path 57, after having been chipped off by the trailing cutting
   edges 53. Bone is thus threaded in conformance with the fastener's tooth profile. As the
                                             20

   fastener 100 advances into the bone, the bone teeth 25 provide positive engagement with
   the fastener 100 without perceptible friction (deleterious heat buildup) or unwanted radial
   forces experienced by the surgeon who-unlike the prior art-can advance the fastener with
   very little effort.
   [0075]     This gives the surgeon precise information on the progress of the procedure.
   The radiused wall 60 on the pilot tracks the predrilled hole precisely without deleterious
   wandering and trauma to the adjacent bone.         The fastener's threads are concomitantly
   self-interlocking with the bone teeth up until the fastener is nearing complete embedment.
   Then, the abutment surface 6 in the bottom of the fastener head contacts cortical bone on
   the outer periphery of the predrilled hole causing vector 5, FIG. 11.
   [0076]     This contact induces a change in force which is perceptible to the surgeon unlike
   the   prior   art.   The    surgeon   thus  has   better "feel"  to  sense  and    adjust the
   compression/torque most beneficial to the procedure.         As mentioned above, the same
   improved tactile feedback exists where the fastener does not have a head, but instead is to
   be countersunk.     Further, an interference thread 71 adjacent the proximal end 6 provides
   additional feedback and retention. This is accomplished by increasing the width 30 of one
   or more thread teeth near proximal end 6 that creates a clamping load on the bone tooth
   25 (by decreasing dimension 34) against bone teeth 25 that were formed by thread cutting
   features at the distal end of the screw.
   [0077]     An alternative (or supplement to this interference thread) would be to change
   (increase) the thread major diameter near the proximal end 73 while maintaining the
   original height 32 at the distal end 72, which provides an interference fit in a different
   way. This (taper) is recognized by reference line 74 and provides increasing drag along
   the major diameter of the threads as the screw is advanced into the bone. Further, the
   fastener with a head can benefit from either or both types of interference fit if desired.

WO 2014/031884                                                               PCT/US2013/056248
   [0078]     Additionally, in the event of side loading (toggling") force vectors 3 FIG. 11
   are constrained by the interlocking capability of the screw threads 24 and 26 that are
   instantly and mechanically interlocked with bone teeth 25. Unlike prior art, loading screw
   100 from one side or the other does not create a gap between the screw and bone on the
   opposite side. This is commonly referred to as "toggling" and often results in failure of
   the screw to bone interface.
   [0079]    A somewhat similar issue occurs when a bending moment 14 is applied to the
   screw 100 wherein the resulting force causes a similar screw produced with buttress or V
   style threads to yield to the force at the root diameter (groove) between two threads.
   When yielding occurs, the thread root acts as a radial groove around the circumference of
   the screw and the full load will focus on the weakest spot (a single thread groove) near
   the apex of the bending moment resulting in failure of the core of the screw. Unlike this
   frailty found in all other thread forms, this instant invention has thread roots that are
   cylindrical in form and lack thread grooves thereby spreading the load of a bending
   moment uniformly along the shaft of the screw.         This provides a more durable and
   reliable screw resistant to bending.
   [0080]    FIGS. 15 and 16 teach the use of a dual thread pattern.       A first interlocking
   thread 110 spirals along cylindrical shaft as before, but a second interlocking thread 120
   also spirals along shaft 13. Note the cutter edges 51 and other details of figures 8 and 10
   appear here as well as the pilot 59. Thus adjacent threads of first interlocking thread 110
   have a second thread 120 interposed there between. This means the pitch of this fastener
   is twice that of the previously described fastener, which results in faster insertion (axial
   advancement) of the dual thread design.        Where time is of the essence, this is an
   important feature, and operations such as this are best concluded expeditiously for many
   reasons, such as asepsis, greater productivity and minimal time of patient anesthesia.
