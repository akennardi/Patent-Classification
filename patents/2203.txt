BACKGROUND
[0002]          It would be desirable to have a process whereby a portable consumer device
could "sign" transaction data associated with a transaction (e.g., a purchase transaction) that
is being conducted by the portable consumer device, so that the recipient of the transaction
data can verify that the portable consumer device being used is in fact authentic. One way
to provide for this is to provide the portable consumer device with a private key in a
public/private key pair. Transaction data can be signed using the private key in the portable
consumer device. The transaction data can then be sent to a recipient who can verify the
digital signature associated with the signed data using the public key of the public/private
key pair.
[0003]          One problem to be solved is how to deliver the private key to the portable
consumer device. An issuer may issue many portable consumer devices to thousands of
consumers. It is difficult to securely deliver private keys to the various portable consumer
devices.
SUMMARY
[0004]          It is the object of the present invention to substantially overcome or
ameliorate one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art, or at least provide a useful
alternative.
                                                  1

[0005]          Embodiments of the disclosure are directed to systems, methods, portable
consumer devices that can securely deliver encryption keys to transaction devices such as
portable consumer devices. In embodiments of the disclosure, a uniquely derived key
(UDK) can be used to encrypt and deliver a key to a portable consumer device operated by
a consumer. The UDK is derived from information that is specifically associated with the
consumer. Alternatively or additionally, the information may be specifically associated
with a portable consumer device that is associated with the consumer. For example, such
information may include an account number associated with the consumer, an expiration date
associated with the portable consumer device, etc. Once the UDK is derived, it can be used to
encrypt a key such as a private key of a public/private key pair. The encrypted private key can
be securely provided to (e.g., sent to) the portable consumer device. After the encrypted key is
received at the portable consumer device, the portable consumer device can use a derived or
previously stored UDK to decrypt the encrypted key. Once the key is decrypted, it is secure in
the portable consumer device and can be used. For instance, if the key is a private key in a
public/private key pair, then the private key can thereafter be used to digitally sign data to
authenticate the portable consumer device in a transaction such as a purchase transaction.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[00020]         One embodiment of the invention is directed to a method comprising encrypting
a first key using a second uniquely derived key to form an encrypted first key. The method also
includes providing the encrypted first key to a transaction device such as a portable consumer
device, where the transaction device contains the second uniquely derived key. The transaction
device may store the second uniquely derived key in a memory.
                                                  3

[0021]         In the specific embodiments below, a "transaction device" in the form of
a portable consumer device is described in detail. It is understood that a transaction
device could also include an access device. In embodiments of the invention, an
encrypted key may be delivered to any suitable transaction device at one end of a
transaction so that the transaction device may sign transaction data that may be
received by a second transaction device at another end of the transaction, whereby
the second transaction device (e.g., a server computer in a payment processing
network) verifies the signed data using a corresponding key. Thus, although the
delivery of an encrypted key to a portable consumer device is described in detail
below, the same principles may be applied to delivery of an encrypted key to another
type of transaction device such as an access device.
[0022]          .     Key delivery
[0023]         Embodiments of the invention are directed to systems, methods,
portable consumer devices that can securely deliver encryption keys, etc. In
embodiments of the invention, a uniquely derived key (UDK) can be used to encrypt
and deliver a first key such as a private key in a public/private key pair, to a portable
consumer device operated by a consumer.
[0024]         The UDK is derived from information that is specifically associated with
the consumer. Alternatively or additionally, the information may be specifically
associated with a portable consumer device that is associated with the consumer,
For example, such information may include an account number associated with the
consumer, an expiration date associated with the portable consumer device, a
consumer's social security number, a consumer's telephone number, etc. In other
embodiments, the UDK may be derived from other types of data. For example, if the
UDK is intended for delivery to an access device such as a POS terminal, then the
information that is used to generate the UDK may include information such as a
terminal ID, location, date of manufacture, etc.
[0025]         Once the UDK is derived, it can be used to encrypt a key, such as a
private key of a public/private key pair, so that it can be securely delivered to a
portable consumer device. After the encrypted private key is received at the portable
consumer device, the portable consumer device can use a derived or previously
stored UDK to decrypt the encrypted private key. Once the private key is decrypted,
                                             4

it is secure in the portable consumer device and can be used. The private key can
be used to digitally sign data to authenticate the portable consumer device in a
transaction such as a purchase transaction.
[0026]           In the preferred embodiments that are described herein, the key that is
encrypted and delivered to the portable consumer device is a private key in a
public/private key pair. It is understood that embodiments of the invention are not
limited to this. For example, the encrypted key that is delivered to the portable
consumer device could be a symmetric private key, or could even be a public key in
a public/private key pair.
[0027]           It is also noted that although the use of a "public" key is described in
detail, it is understood that in embodiments of the invention, a public key may or may
not be available to the general public. It can be "public" in the sense that someone
other than holder of the private key knows about the public key. For instance, in
some cases, the public key may be known to a merchant, issuer, payment
processing organization, and acquirer, but may not be known or available to the
general public.
[0028]           Embodiments of the invention have a number of advantages. For
example, it is difficult for an unauthorized person to decrypt any private key that has
been encrypted with a uniquely derived key. To decrypt the encrypted key, the
unauthorized person would have to know the uniquely derived key that was used to
encrypt the private key. Since the uniquely derived key is uniquely derived, it is
difficult for the unauthorized person to determine. Also, even if the unauthorized
person was able to determine the uniquely derived key, knowledge of a particular
uniquely derived key would only be useful for a single account. Knowledge of one
uniquely derived key will not necessarily apply to other uniquely derived keys, since
each key is uniquely derived using unique data.
[0029]           FIG. 1 shows a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of the invention.
As shown in FIG. 1, a uniquely derived key can be derived (step 102). Once the
uniquely derived key is derived, it can be used to encrypt a key such as a private key
of a public/private key pair (step 104). Once the key is encrypted, it can be delivered
to a portable consumer device (step 106). Once the portable consumer device
receives the encrypted key, the portable consumer device can decrypt the encrypted
                                               5

key using the uniquely derived key that is stored or derived within the portable
consumer device (step 108). Once the encrypted key is decrypted, it may be used
by the portable consumer device (step 110). For example, the portable consumer
device may use the key to sign data to provide an electronic signature. Data may be
subsequently received, and the electronic signature may be verified to ensure that
the data was generated using an authentic portable consumer device.
[0030]        The steps shown in FIG. 1 may be further described with reference to
FIGS. 2 and 3. FIG. 2 shows a diagram of some components of a key distribution
system. FIG. 3 shows a block diagram illustrating how a uniquely derived key can
be formed in one embodiment of the invention.
[0031]        FIG. 2 shows a block diagram of a key distribution system. The system
includes a payment processing network 26 and a number of portable consumer
devices 32(a), 32(b), 32(c). The payment processing network 26 may comprise a
server computer 26(a) and a key database 26(b) operatively coupled to the server
computer 26(a). In this example, the payment processing network 26 may be
operated by a payment processing organization such as Visa Tm. However, in other
embodiments, the server computer 26(a) and the key database 26(b) may be
operated by another entity such as an issuer or a third party payment processor.
[0032]        Referring to both FIGS. 1 and 2, first, a uniquely derived key may be
derived for each portable consumer device 32(a), 32(b), 32(c) (step 102). If the
uniquely derived key is not generated on an as needed basis, it may be derived
beforehand and may be stored in the key database 26(b). As shown in FIG. 2, a
uniquely derived key A may be created for portable consumer device A 32(a), a
uniquely derived key B may be created for portable consumer device B 32(b), and a
uniquely derived key C may be created for portable consumer device C 32(c). Since
each uniquely derived key (e.g., UDKs A, B, and C) is generated using data personal
to the consumers operating the specific portable consumer devices (e.g., portable
consumer devices A, B, and C), the uniquely derived keys (UDKs A, B, and C) could
be generated by the portable consumer devices A, B, and C (32(a)-32(c)) if they
have the same UDK generation algorithm that the payment processing network 26
possesses. Alternatively, they can be previously generated (e.g., by the server
                                           6

computer 26(a) or some other computer apparatus) and stored in the portable
consumer devices A, B, and C 32(a), 32(b), 32(c).
[0033]          An exemplary process for forming a uniquely derived key may be
described with reference to FIG. 3. An account number 201, an account sequence
number 202, an inverse of the account number 203, and an inverse of the account
sequence number 204 are concatenated together to create a concatenated value
210. If necessary, the concatenated value 210 may be padded with zeroes, or some
other value 211, to create a string of a predetermined fixed length. In a preferred
embodiment, the concatenated value 210 may be 128 bits in length, although the
concatenated value is not limited to being this length. The concatenated value 210
is then encrypted 220 using the master derivation key 221 as the encryption key for
each encryption stage. The encryption utilized may include any suitable type of
encryption methodology. For example, this encryption step may utilize DES, Triple
DES, or AES encryption algorithms. The value resulting from the encryption step
220 is a unique derived key or UDK 230. If desired, the UDK 230 may be further
processed to form another UDK. For example, the UDK 230 may be segmented into
different parts, and a particular part of the UDK may form a UDK that can be used to
encrypt a key. This might be done to make the UDK of suitable length for the
selected key encryption process.
[0034]          Second, once a uniquely derived key is obtained, the private key of the
public/private key PAIR is encrypted using the uniquely derived key (step 104). For
example, the payment processing network 26 may use the server computer 26(a) to
encrypt a private key of the public/private key pair. The encryption process may use
an algorithm such as a DES or Triple DES algorithm.
[0035]          Third, the encrypted key is provided to the portable consumer device
(step 106). In some embodiments, the server computer 26(a) may provide the
encrypted private key to the portable consumer device A 32(a) via some
intermediate entity such as a third party processor. If the portable consumer device
A 32(a) is in the form of a phone or a portable computer, the encrypted key may be
provided (e.g., downloaded) from the server computer 26(a) to the phone or portable
computer via an appropriate communications network (e.g., a wireless network, the
Internet, etc.).
                                              7

[0036]          Fourth, after the encrypted private key is received by the portable
consumer device A 32(a), it is decrypted at the portable consumer device 32(a) (step
108). The portable consumer device A 32(a) may decrypt the encrypted private key
using the uniquely derived key A that is in portable consumer device A 32(a). Once
the encrypted private key is decrypted, it may be stored within a secure hardware
element inside of the portable consumer device A 32(a). It can thereafter be used to
digitally sign transaction data associated with a transaction conducted using the
portable consumer device.
[0037]          II.    Purchase Transactions
[0038]          A.     Exemplary Transaction Systems
[0039]          A method of using the delivered public/private key system can be
described with reference to FIGS. 4-5.
[0040]          FIG. 4 shows a block diagram of a purchase transaction system.
Embodiments of the invention are not limited to the described embodiments. For
example, although separate functional blocks are shown for an issuer, payment
processing system, and acquirer, in FIG. 4, some entities perform all of these
functions and may be included in embodiments of invention.
[0041]          FIG. 4 shows a system that can be used in an embodiment of the
invention. The system includes a merchant 22 and an acquirer 24 associated with
the merchant 22. In a typical payment transaction, a consumer 30 may purchase
goods or services at the merchant 22 using a portable consumer device A 32(a).
The acquirer 24 can communicate with an issuer 28 via a payment processing
network 26.
[0042]          The payment processing network 26 may include data processing
subsystems, networks, and operations used to support and deliver authorization
services, exception file services, and clearing and settlement services. An
exemplary payment processing network operated by the payment processing
organization 20 may include VisaNetTM. Payment processing systems such as
VisaNetTM are able to process credit card transactions, debit card transactions, and
other types of commercial transactions. VisaNet TM, in particular, includes a VIP
                                             8

system (Visa Integrated Payments system) which processes authorization requests
and a Base II system which performs clearing and settlement services.
[0043]         The payment processing network 26 may include a server computer
26(a). A server computer is typically a powerful computer or cluster of computers.
For example, the server computer can be a large mainframe, a minicomputer cluster,
or a group of servers functioning as a unit. In one example, the server computer
may be a database server coupled to a Web server. The server computer may also
have a processor and a computer readable medium, which comprises code or
instructions that the processor can execute. For example, it may comprise code for
encrypting a first key using a second uniquely derived key to form an encrypted first
key, and code for providing the encrypted first key to a transaction device, where the
portable consumer device contains the second uniquely derived key. The payment
processing network 26 may use any suitable wired or wireless network, including the
Internet.
[0044]         The merchant 24 may also have, or may receive communications from,
an access device 34 that can interact with the portable consumer device 28(a). The
access devices according to embodiments of the invention can be in any suitable
form. Examples of access devices include point of sale (POS) devices, cellular
phones, PDAs, personal computers (PCs), tablet PCs, handheld specialized readers,
set-top boxes, electronic cash registers (ECRs), automated teller machines (ATMs),
virtual cash registers (VCRs), kiosks, security systems, access systems, and the like.
[0045]         If the access device 34 is a point of sale terminal, any suitable point of
sale terminal may be used including card readers. The card readers may include
any suitable contact or contactless mode of operation. For example, exemplary card
readers can include RF (radio frequency) antennas, magnetic stripe readers, etc. to
interact with the portable consumer device 28(a). It may comprise a computer
readable medium comprising code for receiving an encrypted first key, where the
first key was previously encrypted using a uniquely derived key, and code for
decrypting the encrypted first key using the uniquely derived key.
[0046]         B.      Exemplary Purchase Methods
                                            9

[0047]          Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, in a typical purchase transaction, the
consumer 30 purchases a good or service at the merchant 22 using the portable
consumer device A 32(a) (step 112). The consumer's portable consumer device A
32(a) can interact with an access device 34 such as a POS (point of sale) terminal at
the merchant 22. Using the portable consumer device A 28(a) and the private key
present therein, the portable consumer device A may sign transaction data and this
data may be incorporated into the authorization request message that is to be
forward to the acquirer 24 by the access device 34 (step 114). The transaction data
may include consumer specific information such as an account number, expiration
date, birthday, social security number, etc. Transaction data may also include
purchase information such as SKU information, purchase price information, etc.
[0048]          Before or after the access device 34 receives the signed transaction
data, the signed data may be preprocessed on in any suitable manner. For
example, the signed data may undergo truncation or decimalization processing
before it is incorporated into an authorization request message, and is forwarded by
the access device 34 to the payment processing network 26 via the acquirer 24.
[0049]          After receiving the authorization request message, the authorization
request message is then sent to the payment processing network 26.
[0050]          The payment processing network 26 then receives the signed data
(step 116). It then uses the public key of the public/private key pair is used to verify
that the signed data are authentic (step 118). The public key, which may be stored
in the key database 26(b) can be used to decrypt the signed data and the decrypted
information can be verified (e.g., a decrypted account number can be matched with
other data in the authorization request message or other data that are stored in a
database in the payment processing network 26).
[0051]          Since the public key is public and can be known by someone other
than the consumer 30 or the consumer's portable consumer device 32(a), the public
key can also be sent to the issuer 28, acquirer 24, or even the merchant 22. Using
the public key, any of these entities may verify the signed data provided portable
consumer device 32(a). Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to
verification of signed data by a payment processing network 26.
                                             10

[0052]        After the signed data are verified, the payment processing network 26
then forwards the authorization request message to the issuer 18 of the portable
consumer device 32(a).
[0053]        After the issuer 18 receives the authorization request message, the
issuer 18 sends an authorization response message back to the payment processing
system 20 to indicate whether or not the current transaction is authorized (or not
authorized). If there are insufficient funds or credit in the consumer's account, the
transaction may be declined. If there are sufficient funds or credit in the consumer's
account, the transaction may be authorized. The payment processing system 20
then forwards the authorization response message back to the acquirer 22. The
acquirer 22 then sends the response message back to the merchant 24.
[0054]        After the merchant 22 receives the authorization response message,
the access device 34 at the merchant 22 may then provide the authorization
response message for the consumer 30. The response message may be displayed
by the POS terminal, or may be printed out on a receipt.
[0055]        At the end of the day, a normal clearing and settlement process can be
conducted by the transaction processing system 20. A clearing process is a process
of exchanging financial details between and acquirer and an issuer to facilitate
posting to a consumer's account and reconciliation of the consumer's settlement
position. Clearing and settlement can occur simultaneously.
[0056]        Ill.    Portable consumer devices and computer apparatuses
[0057]        FIGS. 6-7 shows block diagrams of portable computer devices and
subsystems that may be present in computer apparatuses in systems according to
embodiments of the invention.
[0058]        The portable consumer device that is used in embodiments of the
invention may be in any suitable form. For example, suitable portable consumer
devices can be hand-held and compact so that they can fit into a consumer's wallet
and/or pocket (e.g., pocket-sized). They may include smart cards, ordinary credit or
debit cards (with a magnetic strip and without a microprocessor), keychain devices
(such as the SpeedpassTM commercially available from Exxon-Mobil Corp.), etc.
Other examples of portable consumer devices include cellular phones, personal
                                            11

digital assistants (PDAs), pagers, payment cards, security cards, access cards,
smart media, transponders, and the like. The portable consumer devices can also
be debit devices (e.g., a debit card), credit devices (e.g., a credit card), or stored
value devices (e.g., a stored value card).
[0059]         An exemplary portable consumer device 32' in the form of a phone may
comprise a computer readable medium and a body as shown in FIG. 6(a). (FIG. 6(a)
shows a number of components, and the portable consumer devices according to
embodiments of the invention may comprise any suitable combination or subset of
such components.) The computer readable medium 32(b) may be present within the
body 32(h), or may be detachable from it. The body 32(h) may be in the form a
plastic substrate, housing, or other structure. The computer readable medium 32(b)
may be a memory that stores data and may be in any suitable form including a
magnetic stripe, a memory chip, uniquely derived keys (such as those described
above), encryption algorithms, private keys, etc. It may comprise code for receiving
an encrypted first key, where the first key was previously encrypted using a uniquely
derived key, and code for decrypting the encrypted first key using the uniquely
derived key. The memory also preferably stores information such as financial
information, transit information (e.g., as in a subway or train pass), access
information (e.g., as in access badges), etc. Financial information may include
information such as bank account information, bank identification number (BIN),
credit or debit card number information, account balance information, expiration
date, consumer information such as name, date of birth, etc.
[0060]         Information in the memory may also be in the form of data tracks that
are traditionally associated with credits cards. Such tracks include Track 1 and
Track 2. Track 1 ("International Air Transport Association") stores more information
than Track 2, and contains the cardholder's name as well as account number and
other discretionary data. This track is sometimes used by the airlines when securing
reservations with a credit card. Track 2 ("American Banking Association") is
currently most commonly used. This is the track that is read by ATMs and credit
card checkers. The ABA (American Banking Association) designed the
specifications of this track and all world banks must abide by it. It contains the
cardholder's account, encrypted PIN, plus other discretionary data.
                                             12

[0061]         The portable consumer device 32 may further include a contactless
element 32(g), which is typically implemented in the form of a semiconductor chip (or
other data storage element) with an associated wireless transfer (e.g., data
transmission) element, such as an antenna. Contactless element 32(g) is
associated with (e.g., embedded within) portable consumer device 32 and data or
control instructions transmitted via a cellular network may be applied to contactless
element 32(g) by means of a contactless element interface (not shown). The
contactless element interface functions to permit the exchange of data and/or control
instructions between the mobile device circuitry (and hence the cellular network) and
an optional contactless element 32(g).
[0062]         Contactless element 32(g) is capable of transferring and receiving data
using a near field communications ("NFC") capability (or near field communications
medium) typically in accordance with a standardized protocol or data transfer
mechanism (e.g., ISO 14443/NFC). Near field communications capability is a short
range communications capability, such as RFID, BluetoothT M , infra-red, or other data
transfer capability that can be used to exchange data between the portable
consumer device 32 and an interrogation device. Thus, the portable consumer
device 32 is capable of communicating and transferring data and/or control
instructions via both cellular network and near field communications capability.
[0063]         The portable consumer device 32 may also include a processor 32(c)
(e.g., a microprocessor) for processing the functions of the portable consumer device
32 and a display 32(d) to allow a consumer to see phone numbers and other
information and messages. The portable consumer device 32 may further include
input elements 32(e) to allow a consumer to input information into the device, a
speaker 32(f) to allow the consumer to hear voice communication, music, etc., and a
microphone 32(i) to allow the consumer to transmit her voice through the portable
consumer device 32. The portable consumer device 32 may also include an
antenna 32(a) for wireless data transfer (e.g., data transmission).
[0064]         If the portable consumer device is in the form of a debit, credit, or
smartcard, the portable consumer device may also optionally have features such as
magnetic strips. Such devices can operate in either a contact or contactless mode.
                                             13

[0065]          An example of a portable consumer device 32" in the form of a card is
shown in FIG. 6(b). FIG. 6(b) shows a plastic substrate 32(m). A contactless
element 32(o) for interfacing with an access device 34 may be present on or
embedded within the plastic substrate 32(m). Consumer information 32(p) such as
an account number, expiration date, and consumer name may be printed or
embossed on the card. Also, a magnetic stripe 32(n) may also be on the plastic
substrate 32(m).
[0066]          As shown in FIG. 6(b), the portable consumer device 32" may include
both a magnetic stripe 32(n) and a contactless element 32(o). In other
embodiments, both the magnetic stripe 32(n) and the contactless element 32(o) may
be in the portable consumer device 32". In other embodiments, either the magnetic
stripe 32(n) or the contactless element 32(o) may be present in the portable
consumer device 32".
[0067]          The various participants and elements in FIG. 2 and 4 may operate or
use one or more computer apparatuses to facilitate the functions described herein.
Any of the elements in FIG. 2 and 4 may use any suitable number of subsystems to
facilitate the functions described herein. Examples of such subsystems or
components are shown in FIG. 7. The subsystems shown in FIG. 7 are
interconnected via a system bus 775. Additional subsystems such as a printer 774,
keyboard 778, fixed disk 779 (or other memory comprising computer readable
media), monitor 776, which is coupled to display adapter 782, and others are shown.
Peripherals and input/output (1/O) devices, which couple to 1/O controller 771, can be
connected to the computer system by any number of means known in the art, such
as serial port 777. For example, serial port 777 or external interface 781 can be
used to connect the computer apparatus to a wide area network such as the Internet,
a mouse input device, or a scanner. The interconnection via system bus allows the
central processor 773 to communicate with each subsystem and to control the
execution of instructions from system memory 772 or the fixed disk 779, as well as
the exchange of information between subsystems. The system memory 772 and/or
the fixed disk 779 may embody a computer readable medium.
[0068]          The above description is illustrative and is not restrictive. Many
variations of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon
