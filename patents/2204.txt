rear loading and unloading of ISO containers etc. without hook lift subframe/skid as well as (a)
roller bearing(s), which is/are installed on the rear frame of the hook lift device, for loading and
unloading roll-on/roll-off/hook lift containers, bins etc. with hook lift subframe/skid.
4. The combined hook lift/hooklift device with moveable, sliding cart/carriage of claim 1. - being
equipped with a hydraulic cylinder on the moveable, sliding cart/carriage, which allows
tilting/dumping of both, ISO containers etc. as well as of roll-on/roll-off/hook lift containers etc.,
