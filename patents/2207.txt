                                           ABSTRACT
         The present invention belongs to the field of medical biotechnology, and particular
   relates to a Reticulocyte Growth Factor (RGF) and a preparing method and application
   thereof. The factor is separated and purified from impurities of ai-antitrypsin (from human
 5 plasma), and the fragment of a precursor of the antitrypsin is determined, and has very high
   function of promoting the generation of the reticulocyte of mice. Monoclonal antibody of
                                                                                         125
   EPO is not combined with the reticulocyte growth factor, which is labeled with I          , after
   the reticulocyte growth factor is combined with surface receptors of mouse bone marrow
   cells, the EPO cannot compete with the reticulocyte growth factor. The EPO and RGF are
10 labeled with different fluorochromes, and it is proved that they have different receptors.
   The factor and EPO are injected into the mice or aplastic anemia mice, and an obvious
   synergistic effect for promoting the generation of the reticulocyte ,  red cell and leukocyte
   is generated. The reticulocyte growth factor can be used for preparing the medicine for
   treating severe anemia.

    RETICULOCYTE GROWTH FACTOR AND PREPARING METHOD
                               AND APPLICATION THEREOF
        The present application is a divisional application of Australian Application No.
   2014379070, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.

   Technical Field
        The present invention relates to the field of medical biotechnology, and in particular
   relates to a reticulocyte growth factor and a preparing method and application thereof
   Related Art
10      At present, the most efficient medicine for clinically treating severe anemia is
   Erythropoietin (rhu-EPO). Since the recombinant human (rhu) EPO of the Amgen Company
   in America was approved by FDA in 1989, the rhu-EPO has been generally commonly
   accepted, and has developed to the most successful example in DNA recombinant medicine.
   EPO is one unique special red cell increasing factor in generation of red cells as so far.
15 Although it is reported that Stem Cell Growth Factor (SCF) and Colony Stimulating Factors
   (CSFs) also have a promoting action for the red cells, their functions are diversified and not
   exclusive. At present, no new medicine for treating the severe anemia is found yet.
                                              SUMMARY
         The present invention aims to provide a new cell growth factor- Reticulocyte Growth
20 Factor (RGF), and a preparing method and application thereof.
         In a research process of the present invention, in kidney cell culture fluid, proteins with
   erythropoiesis activity exist in both human urine and plasma, but their molecular weights,
   immunogenicity and even receptors are different from EPO. The content of such active
   proteins is very low, it is difficult to obtain enough pure products for quality research, and
25 finally, it is found that impurities from an ai-antitrypsin preparation of the human plasma has
   high activity for promoting generation of reticulocyte. Several high-activity proteins,
   obtained by biochemical         and purifying means such as High Performance               Liquid
   Chromatography (HPLC), are peptide fragments of different lengths in a precursor of the
                                                    1

   ai-antitrypsin, and have carbohydrates of different lengths, and some components have few
   or no carbohydrate.
         Technical solutions of the present invention
         1. Purification of RGF
 5       a, the ai-antitrypsin preparation (A-9024) of Sigma Company is from human plasma,
   and has very high activity for promoting generation of the reticulocyte. Activity inspection
   adopts a mouse reticulocyte determining method of professor CHENG Yaqin, which is
   described as follows:
         animals: ICR mice, weight: 18-22kg, male
10       samples: diluting according to the activity of RGF, 5-20jg/ml in common
         method: dividing three mice in one group, intramuscularly injecting 0.06ml, 0.12ml
   and 0.24ml, injecting for three days continuously, sampling eye socket blood on the fourth
   day, adding 7-8 drops into a tube with a lid filled with 20pl 100U/ml of heparin sodium,
   mixing uniformly, taking out 50p blood, dropwise adding on dried brilliant cresyl blue dye
15 precoated at one end of a glass slide, fully mixing, and placing in a 37'C wet box for 30
   minutes; pushing single layer of cells on a second glass slide, after naturally drying, fixing
   with methyl alcohol, then redyeing through Wright's stain, dropwise adding 0.02mol/LPBS
   (PH6.8), avoiding drying up, and washing the dye liquor with PBS or distilled water after
   30 minutes;
20       reading a film by a high power oil immersion lens, where a nucleus substance in the
   reticulocyte can be dyed to be deep blue color dot-like, line-like, chain-like or cluster-like,
   while the red cells do not contain such substance; counting 500-1000 red cells in common
   and calculating the percentage of the reticulocyte; reading two films for each sample,
   averaging, then averaging again for three mice in each group, and subtracting the
25 percentage of the reticulocyte in a control group (0.12pl normal saline) to obtain the net
   increase percentage of the reticulocyte, defining every 1% of increase as one unit (U), and
   calculating specific activity by injected protein content (once), namely taking the rising unit
   stimulated by each mg of protein (U/mg) as the specific activity;
                                                   2

   saline, taking 15 ICR male mice (weight: 18-22g), dividing into 5 groups each of which
   contains 3 mice, intramuscularly injecting 0.12ml normal saline into the control group,
   injecting 0.12ml antitrypsin preparation of different concentrations into the rest growped
 5 mice, injecting for three days continuously, sampling eye socket blood on the fourth day,
   dyeing by brilliant cresyl blue, and calculating the percentage of the reticulocyte in the red
   cells with the oil immersion lens, wherein a result shows that the activity for promoting the
   generation of the reticulocyte in the antitrypsin preparation is very high, and can serve as an
   initial material for further separation and purifying. The result is as shown in Table 1:

15       In order to determining the chemical properties of the bands 1 and 3 prepared by
   SDS-PAGE, the gel bands displayed by staining were sent to the Suzhou ProtTech Inc. for
   determining the sequences of the N end and C end, a result shows that the band 1 (RTF-6 in
   a sequencing report of the Suzhou ProtTech Inc.) contains four components which are
   fragments of different lengths of the precursor of the ai-antitrypsin, N end sites have slight
20 difference, the C ends are same as the C ends of precursor, band 3 (RTF-8 in a report of the
   Suzhou ProtTech Inc.) contains only one component, the N end and C end are totally same
   as the bands 1-2 and contain 394 amino acids in total from the 25 site to the 418 site, the
   band 1 has a molecular weight of about 50000, which is 10000 larger than the band 3, it is
   known that the band 1 contains carbohydrate, the components in the band 1 are
25 glycoproteins, the band 3 does not contain carbohydrate through speculation from the
   molecular weight, or contains extremely less carbohydrate.
         The RGF family is a group of protein fragments with different lengths and different
   carbohydrate contents from the precursor of the ai-antitrypsin. An amino acid sequence
20 thereof is:

         The cyclophosphamide can obviously cause anemia to the mice, gneration of the red
   cells can be promoted by injecting the EPO or RGF, for example, the therapeutic action,
   achieved by half amount of EPO and half amount of RGF, for co-treating the generation of
10 the red cells is better than the therapeutic action achieved by single whole amount of the
   RGF or EPO, an obvious synergistic effect is achieved, and it should be noted that the RGF
   or EPO further has a promotion action for the generation of leukocytes, and have the same
   synergistic effect.
         b, synergistic effect of the RGF and EPO for generation of mouse reticulocyte

                                                                                   RGF2.5pg/ml

         The RGF and EPO both have well activity for promoting the generation of the
   reticulocyte, 18U/ml of EPO and 5 tg/ml of RGF are very close in activity, after the EPO
10 and the RGF are mixed in the same amount, an obvious synergistic effect is generated,
   especially, the test group injected with the 0.24ml is higher than the test group injected with
   the 0.24ml of the EPO or RGF by about 50% in reticulocyte increase, then is this
   phenomenon possibly the false appearance caused by the generation of the mouse EPO
   caused by the RGF in vivo, for this purpose, we design a process that after the RGF of
15 different dosages is injected to the mice for 3 days, the EPO level in blood of the mice is
   determined by monoclonal antibody to compare with the normal saline control group, the
   EPO level is not increased, so that such possibility is excluded. It is inferred that the EPO
   and the RGF act in different development stages of the red cells, under a relay action of the
   EPO and the RGF, the speed of the red cells is naturally increased. This hypothesis is
20 verified in follow fluorescence labeling experiment.
         The synergistic effect of the RGF and EPO occurs in the two experiments, and this
   phenomenon has great significance in treatment of the severe anemia and indicates a
   potential of more reasonably and more effectively treating the severe anemia.

         c, fluorescence labeling experiment
         labeling the EPO with fluorochrome rhodamine (RB200), wherein the EPO is red
   under the observation of a fluorescence microscope, labeling the RGF with fluorochrome
   FITC, wherein the RGF is green under the observation of the fluorescence microscope,
 5 sampling about 2ml of bone marrow cells from longs bones of four mice, centrifuging at
    1000r/m for four minutes, pouring off supernatant, resuspending in 6ml of Hank'S liquid,
   separating through a lymphocyte separating medium, and taking and centrifuging interface
   cells; diluting the cells with RPMI1640 into 1.8x10 6/ml of cell suspension, taking 5ml of
   cell suspension, centrifuging, resuspending in 0.3ml of PBS, adding 60VI of FITC-RGF and
10 60l of RB200-EPO, placing in a refrigerator for 30 minutes, wherein, by observing under
   the fluorescence microscope, most cells are doubly labeled, a few cells are singly labeled
   by FITC-RGF, but there are no cells labeled by RB200-EPO. This phenomenon prompts
   that the RGF is used in an earlier stage of a cell development process, an EPO receptor does
   not occur till the cells are developed to the next stage under the promotion of the RGF,
15 therefore, the dual-receptor cells on which the RGF and EPO show at the cells occur.
         Beneficial effects of the present invention
         Differentiation    and     maturation    of   the   red   cells   are   a    multi-stage
   multifactor-participated complicated process, however, a second factor for promoting the
   generation of the red cells is not found for last 20 years, so that the finding of the
20 reticulocyte growth factor has great significance. When the reticulocyte growth factor and
   EPO are combined in use, the effect is better than that when the reticulocyte growth factor
   or EPO is singly used. It is indicated that different development stages of the red cells need
   different induction and promotion of differnet factors, which is a new start for us to learn
   the total development process of the red cells, and treat the severe anemia. The present
25 invention helps to explain the synergistic effect of the RGF and EPO occurring in normal
   mice and aplastic anemia mice. Because they act in different development stages of the red
   cells, and bone marrow cells generate more EPO receptors under the action of the RGF, and
   thus are developed to dual-receptor cells, the EPO then continuous acts, and the better
   effect can be understood under a relay action. The invnetion develops a new medicine for
                                                   11

   treating the severe anemia.

   reversed-phase column in first separation, wherein 3 collected parts are obtained from the
 5 first separation, and the 3rd part has activity.
         FIG. 2 is 10 collected parts obtained by the HPLC C18 reversed-phase column in
   second separation larger than the first separation by gradient, wherein the eighth peak
   collected part pointed by the arrow has higher activity.
         FIG. 3 is an SDS-PAGE diagram of an eighth part in the ten collected parts in the
10 second HPLC separation, wherein a molecular weight is about 50000, the part dyed with
   the deepest color is band 1 (RGF-B1), the molecular weights of about 40000 are called as
   band 3 (RGF-B3), the part between the B1 and B3 is called as RGF-B2, and the parts above
   B 1 have no activity.
                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
15       1, taking two bottles of ai-antitrypsin, dissolving in pH7.0 0.02MOL/L of PBS with the
   concentration of 2.5mg/ml, performing neutral separation by an High Performance Liquid
   Chromatography (HPLC) C18 column, and obtaining 3 peak groups, wherein, as shown in
   FIG. 1, the 3rd peak group shows a strong action for promoting the generation of
   reticulocyte;
20       2, re-separating the third peak group, but pulling the separated eluting gradient, and
   obtaining 10 collected parts, wherein only the 7th, 8th and 9th collected parts show the
   activity for promoting the generation of the reticulocyte, the 8th collected part has the
   highest activity as shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3; performing preparative SDS-PAGE on the
   8th collected part, longitudinally cutting a piece of gel, dyeing by Coomassie Brilliant Blue
25 to determine the position of proteins, wherein a deeper and wider band occurs at the
   position of the molecular weight of about 50000; cutting the corresponding gel block as
   band 1, cutting a clear band at the position of the molecular weight of about 40000 as band
   3, wherein, 3-4 dyed bands between the band 1 and band 3 are fuzzy, one of the bands is
                                                    12

   close to number 1, and is called as band 2, and the band between the molecular weights of
   50000-68000 is called as band 4;        crushing the gel of the four parts with glass rods
   individually, extracting for 24 hours with water, sucking out supernatant, and repeating for
   three times; combining and freeze-drying the extracting liquors obtained at four times on
 5 the 5th day, and dissolving with a small amount of water and then determining the activity,
   wherein a result shows that the extracting liquors of the bands 1, 2 and 3 have high activity,
   and the band 4 has no activity, and the result is as shown in table 3;
        4, performing SDS-PAGE on the extracting liquors of the bands 1, 2 and 3, wherein the
   bands 1 and 3 have clear strips after staining, the band 2 has fuzzy strips, some strips are
10 very close to the band 1 in position, therefore, the dyeing gel of the bands 1 and 3 are sent
   to the ProtTech Inc. for sequencing, a determining result shows that the bands 1 and 3 are
   parts of a precursor of the ai-antitrypsin and a result is as shown in the amino acid
   sequence;
        5, in order to determine the chemical properties of the bands 1 and 3, the SDS-PAGE,
15 drying gel blocks of the band 1 and band 3 are sent to the Suzhou ProtTech Inc. for
   sequencing, and a result is as shown in attachment 2. The N end and C end sequencing
   result shows that four components contained in the band 1 are fragments of different
   lengths in the precursor of the ai-Antitrypsinm, the precursor is composed of 418 amino
   acids, these fragments have different start points of the N ends, and are respectively 24, 25,
20 27 and 30 site amino acids; the C ends are same as the tail ends of the precursor. The band
   3 contains single component, is totally same as the band 1-2 in structure and is composed of
   394 amino acids in total from the 25h site to the 418th site. But the molecular weight is
   smaller than band 1 that contains carbohydrate, and based on the molecular weight, the
   band 3 contains no or extremely less carbohydrate;
25      6, the sequence of the precursor of the ai-Antitrypsin is known, the molecular weight
   of antitrypsin is known as 55000 - 56000, the bands 1 and 3 are both smaller than the
   precursor in molecular weight, and plural components between the molecular weights of
   50000-40000 also show activity. It is estimated that the precursor of the Antitrypsin can be
   degraded into a group of peptide fragments in different lengths, and these peptide fragments
                                                  13

  also have carbohydrate chains of different lengths or no carbohydrate. It is still unknown
  yet that whether the active protein groups composed of the peptide fragments have different
  action sites, but all the components of the antitrypsin family participate in the action of
  regulating the generation of the red cells in organism together with the EPO.
