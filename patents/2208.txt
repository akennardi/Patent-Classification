   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   1. Field of the Invention
 5        The present disclosure relates to food processing
   and in      particular              to   a Bio-enzyme nutrition                      enhancement
   technology              (BioENZ) System.
   2. Description of the Related Art
          In   the growth of a plant,                           antinutritional factors
10 may be synthesized in                        seeds or plants of the plant,                               so
   as      to    allow          resistance              against           stresses,             such        as
   herbivores,               insects,           pathogens,              or    harsh       weather           or
   environmental                  conditions,              where        the      antinutritional
   factors           include              inositol           hexaphosphate,                    saponin,
15 amylase           inhibitors,                 protease              inhibitors,               trypsin
   inhibitors,              hemagglutinin,                 phytic        acid,       and the         like.
   Althoughthese                antinutritional                 factors         allowresistance
   against          stresses, these                   antinutritional                   factors           may
   affect       the      efficiency             of absorption                or utilization                 of
20 nutritional              ingredients             of the       plant       by the      human body,
   resulting             in      incomplete              exploiting              of     nutritional
   values        of     the       plant        in   the     human        body.        For      example,
   inositol          hexaphosphate in                    leguminous plants                   interacts
   with proteins,                  vitamins          and minerals. Phytic acid is
25 a multivalent              cyclic         substance,           and is       an important             form
   for storage of phosphors in                              a natural            plant.        However,
   phytic       acid        cannot         be digested             by the        human body,              and

                                                             2
   the property of multivalence of phytic acid causes its
   chelation with minerals to form phytates, decreasing
   absorption                rate         of      minerals.              Tannins            are        phenolic
   compounds widely present                               in    the      body of a plant,                      their
 5 functional                groups            can       bond        with         proteins               to      form
   precipitates,                          affecting                    digestibilities                             and
   digestibility                     coefficients of                    proteins.
          In    order           to     avoid         the      effect           of      antinutritional
   factors          onnutritionalvalues                          of aplant,              conventionally,
10 thermal            processing                 is     used        to      reduce           or      eliminate
   antinutritional                       factors           in      the       body         of     the        plant.
   Although thermal                      processing              can effectively                     attenuate
   the      effect          of       antinutritional                    factors            on     the        plant,
   oxidation            of lipids             may be induced in                     the     plant         treated
15 by thermal            processing                 and availability                    of proteins                and
   essential            minerals             is     reduced,          resulting             in    generation
   of toxic           compounds and loss                       of nutrients                  in    the      plant.
   Accordingly, in order to overcome the defects of the
   prior       art,       it      is    necessary            to    provide            an effective                 and
20 safe       method           for      removing             antinutritional                      factors            in
   seeds orplants                   ofaplant,            achievingacompromisebetween
   nutritional                 values           and availability                      of    the       plant.

   vitamins, proteins,              dietary      fibers       can also be improved.
         Further,        the BioENZ system according to the present
 5 disclosure          achieves the following effects                     in    a natural
   way:
         first,        the   content         of    nutrients        in     a    plant       is
   effectively increased, so as to increase nutritional
   values oF the plant,                such that        the processed plant can
10 be more easily           absorbed and utilized                by the human body;
         second,        the    quality        of    nutrients        in     a   plant       is
   stabilizedby           increased activity             of enzymes in the plant,
   so as to reduce the disadvantages                          of loss of nutrients
   in the prior art;               and
15       third,       there is     no need for reducing the content of
   antinutritional            factors       in a plant in a non-natural way,
   which        can     not    only       reduce        an     adverse        effect        of
   antinutritional            factors       on thehumanbody, but also avoid
   doubts with regard to prevention of food safety.
20       The present disclosure                has been described in                 detail
   above only with reference to a preferred embodiment,
   and any simple modifications or variations                            made by those
   skilled in the art without departing from the spirit
   of the present disclosure, such as configurations of
25 the     regulation         portion        or    aspects       of    the     nutrition
   enhancement portion,                 all   fall      within the scope of the
   claims of the present disclosure.
