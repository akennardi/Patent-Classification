Title:     Methods, reagents and kits for detecting minimal residual disease
                                         Abstract
            The invention relates to the field of minimal residual disease (MRD)
diagnostics, which is progressively more applied for the evaluation of treatment
effectiveness in patients with a hematological malignancy, such as B-cell precursor
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B
CLL), and multiple myeloma (MM). Provided are unique reagent compositions with
carefully selected and thoroughly tested combinations of antibodies, for > 8-color flow
cytometric stainings as well as for 10-color and 12-color flow cytometric stainings,
which can reach sensitivities of at least 104, even down to 10-.  Also provided are
diagnostic kits and methods for detecting MRD.

   Title:       Methods, reagents and kits for detecting minimal residual disease
                This is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2013274965
   which is the Australian National Phase of PCT/NL2013/050420 filed 14 June 2013,
   which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/659,524 filed
   14 June 2012. The contents of each application listed in this paragraph are fully
 5 incorporated by reference herein.
                The invention relates to the field of cancer diagnosis, more specifically to
   means and method for the monitoring of disease development during and after
   treatment or for the detection of minimal disseminated disease. Cytostatic or cytotoxic
   treatment induces remission in the majority of patients with lymphoid malignancies.
10 Nevertheless many of these patients relapse. Apparently the current cytostatic or
   cytotoxic treatment protocols are not capable of killing all malignant cells in these
   relapsing patients, although they reached so-called complete remission according to
   cytomorphological criteria. Since the detection limit of cytomorphological techniques
   is not lower than 1-5 % malignant cells, it is obvious that such techniques can only
15 provide superficial information about the effectiveness of treatment, up to 1010 tumor
   cells still potentially remaining in the body.
                Techniques with a higher sensitivity to detect "minimal
   residual disease" or minimal disease (MRD) are needed to obtain better insight in the
   reduction of tumor mass during induction treatment and further eradication of the
20 malignant cells during maintenance treatment from one or more than one tissue. The
   application of flow cytometry for detection of MRD is traditionally based on
   discrimination between malignant cells and normal leukocytes via malignancy
   associated phenotypic characteristics, such as aberrant expression, overexpression,
   and cross-lineage expression of antigens.
25              Current 4-color and 6-color flow cytometry reaches a fair sensitivity of 10-3
   (to 104) in most patients with a hematological malignancy. However, it should be
   noted that the detection of low frequencies of malignant cells in blood, bone marrow
   and other body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid during and after therapy and after
   hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be hampered by high frequencies of
30 normal regenerating cells. The extent and the pattern of regeneration differs per
   treatment protocol, per phase of treatment, per time of sampling, and seems to be
   dependent on the intensity of the preceding treatment: the more intensive the
   treatment, the more prominent the regeneration of hematopoietic cells.

                                               2
                Logically, both the background of regenerating cells and the drug-induced
   immunophenotypic shifts reduce the sensitivity and specificity of the existing 4-color
   and 6-color flow cytometric MRD methods. This has mainly lead to approaches in
   which either multiple combinations of markers are used to evaluate MRD in a patient
 5 or, alternatively to use one or a few patient-specific combinations of markers.
   Recognizing the need for improved diagnostic methods for MRD, the present inventors
   set out to identify additional markers which could be used to obtain a more sensitive
   and reliable assay for detecting MRD, particularly based on a fully integrated
   approach, in which information of multiple markers is combined via multivariate
10 analysis. In addition, this new approach is not anymore limited to individual patients,
   but is applicable to every patient of a specific disease category, such B-cell precursor
   acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B
   CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM).
15              After careful selection of the relevant markers, design of appropriate
   combinations of antibodies in multi-color tubes, and the selection of suited
   fluorochromes (based on need for brightness, compensation, stability, etc.), a set of
   antibody reagents was developed. The studies were complemented with extensive
   multicentric evaluation of the consensus panels in order to reshape and achieve an
20 optimal efficiency. The inventors designed novel > 8-color stainings with carefully
   selected and thoroughly tested combinations of antibodies, which can reach
   sensitivities of 104 to 10-5 Based on design-testing-redesign-retesting-redesign (etc.),
   specific combinations of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies have been developed per
   disease category, such as BCP-ALL, B-CLL and MM. One or two           8-color
25 combinations per patient will allow careful MRD monitoring with sensitivities of at
   least 10-4. The provided 10-color and 12-color antibody combinations can even better
   discriminate between normal cells and their malignant counterparts, thereby
   allowing for MRD detection with sensitivities down to 10-5.
30 Here we present novel 8-color 10-color and 12-color antibody combinations for
   detection of MRD in a sample, e.g. blood or bone marrow, isolated from patients with:
                -  B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL)
                -  B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) or

                                             3
                - Multiple myeloma (MM) and related plasma cell disorders (PCD).
   These multi-color immunostainings can be performed according to the so-called
   EuroFlow protocols as described by Van Dongen et al. Leukemia 2012; 26: 1908-1075
 5 and by Kalina et al. Leukemia 2012; 26: 1986-20 10.
   Accordingly, the invention provides unique reagent compositions for flow cytometric
   detection of MRD, comprising a combination of at least eight distinct fluorochrome
   conjugated antibodies. In particular, the reagent compositions are of use for detecting
10 MRD in patients with BCP-ALL, B-CLL or MM/PCD. In a preferred embodiment, the
   composition comprises monoclonal antibodies against a given CD antigen. CD stands
   for cluster designation and is a nomenclature for the identification of specific cell
   surface antigens or intracellular antigens defined by monoclonal antibodies.
   (Monoclonal) antibodies against the indicated markers can be commercially obtained
15 from various companies, including Becton/Dickinson (BD) Biosciences, Dako,
   Beckman Coulter, CYTOGNOS, Caltag, Pharmingen, Exbio, Sanquin, Invitrogen, and
   the like.
   Flow cvtometric MRD detection in BCP-ALL
20 In one embodiment, the invention provides a reagent composition for flow cytometric
   detection of BCP-ALL cells in a human subject, comprising a panel of at least eight
   distinct fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. The BCP-ALL panel comprises
   antibodies against the four "core markers" CD10, CD19, CD20, CD34 and CD45.
   Preferably, the panel further comprises one or more antibodies selected from the
25 group of antibodies against CD38, CD81, Cylgp, and deoxynucleotidyl transferase
   (NuTdT). Very good results are obtained if the panel further comprises one or more
   sets of antibodies selected from (a) set of antibodies against CD66c and CD123; (b) set
   of antibodies against CD304 and CD73; and (c) set of antibodies against SmIgK and
   SmIgA, wherein the antibodies within each set are conjugated to the same
30 fluorochrome. In a specific aspect, the BCP-ALL panel comprises antibodies against
   CD10, CD19, CD20, CD34, CD45, one or more antibodies selected from the group of
   antibodies against CD38, CD81, Cylgp, NuTdT, and two or more sets of antibodies
   selected from (a) set of antibodies against CD66c and CD123; (b) set of antibodies

                                             4
   against CD304 and CD73; and (c) set of antibodies against SmIgK and SmIgX, wherein
   the antibodies within each set are conjugated to the same fluorochrome.
   For example, a reagent composition comprises distinct fluorochrome-conjugated
   antibodies directed against one of the following combinations of markers:
 5        (i) CD20, CD45, CD81, CD66c, CD 123, CD34, CD 19, CD10 and CD38, wherein
   the antibodies against CD66c and CD123 are conjugated to the same fluorochrome;
          (ii) CD20, CD45, CD81, CD304, CD73, CD34, CD19, CD1O and CD38, wherein
   the antibodies against CD304 and CD73 are conjugated to the same fluorochrome;
          (iii) CD20, CD45, NuTdT, SmIgK, SmIgX, Cylgp, CD19, CD34 and CD10,
10 wherein the antibodies against SmIgK and SmIgX are conjugated to the same
   fluorochrome. See for instance the 8-color BCP-ALL MRD Panel 1A.
   As another example, it comprises distinct fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies directed
   against the markers CD20, CD45, CD81, NuTdT, CD34, CD 19, CD10 and CD38, and
15 one or more sets of antibodies selected from (a) set of antibodies against CD66c and
   CD123; (b) set of antibodies against CD304 and CD73; and (c) set of antibodies
   against SmIg    and SmIgA, wherein the antibodies within each set are conjugated to
   the same fluorochrome. See for instance the 10-color tube in Panel lB comprising
   antibodies against the markers CD20, CD45, CD81, NuTdT, CD66c, CD123, CD304,
20 CD73, CD34, CD19, CD10 and CD38.
   In a further specific aspect, the composition comprises a combination of fluorochrome
   conjugated antibodies directed against the markers CD20, CD45, CD81, NuTdT,
   CD66c, CD123, CD304, CD73, SmIgK, SmIgX, Cylgp, CD34, CD19, CD1O and CD38,
25 wherein the antibodies against each of the sets CD66c/CD 123, CD304/CD73 and
   SmIgx/ SmIgX are conjugated to the same fluorochrome. See for instance the 12-color
   tube in panel 1C.
   Suitable fluorochromes for conjugating antibodies for use in the present invention
30 against the recited markers are known in the art. As will be understood, the
   fluorochromes used within a reagent composition should be distinguishable from each
   other by flow cytometry. The fluorochromes are preferably selected for brightness,

                                              5
   limited spectral overlap and limited need for compensation, stability, etc (see: Kalina
   et al. Leukemia 2012: 26: 1986-2010).

    15   A further aspect of the invention relates to a diagnostic kit for detecting MRD, in
         particular BCP-ALL MRD, CLL MRD or MM/PCD MRD comprising one or more of

                                             11
   the reagent compositions described herein above, optionally together with instructions
   for use, buffer, and/or control samples (see: Kalina et al. Leukemia 2012: 26: 1986
   2010). In one embodiment, there is provided a BCP-ALL kit comprising one or more
   reagent compositions of Table 1. In another embodiment, there is provided a CLL kit
 5 comprising one or more reagent compositions of Table 2. In still a further
   embodiment, there is provided a PCD kit comprising one or more reagent
   compositions of Table 3.
   The invention also relates to a method for flow cytometric detection of MRD,
10 comprising the steps of providing a biological sample from a human subject and
   contacting at least a portion (aliquot) of the sample with a reagent composition
   provided herein. Any type of sample known or suspected to contain leukocytes may be
   used directly, or after lysing non-nucleated red cells, or after density centrifugation, or
   after cell sorting procedures. For example, the sample is peripheral blood, bone
15 marrow, tissue sample such as lymph nodes, adenoid, spleen, or liver, or other type of
   body fluid such as cerebrospinal fluid, vitreous fluid, synovial fluid, pleural effusions
   or ascitis. Peripheral blood or bone marrow is preferred.
   Provided is a multi-color flow cytometric method for detecting minimal residual
   disease (MRD) in a biological sample comprising cells, preferably B-lineage cells (B
20 cell precursors, B-lymphocytes, and plasma cells), comprising the steps of:
   (i)     staining the sample with a reagent composition according to the invention,
   (ii)    subjecting the sample to flow cytometry; (iii) gating on cells for expression of
   the selected markers detected by the antibodies present in the reagent composition;
   (iv) distinguishing between normal and malignant cells, based on the expression
25 profile of the multiple markers.
   Preferably, the analysis in step (iv) involves multivariate analysis, preferably
   principal component analysis (PCA), wherein each marker has added value in the
   distinction process via the principal component analysis. Advantageously, using
   automated population separation -APS view- is used employing for example Infinicyt
30 software, or multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis.
   PCA is a mathematical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a
   set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of uncorrelated
   variables called principal components. The number of principal components is less

                                                12
   than or equal to the number of original variables. This transformation is defined in
   such a way that the first principal component has as high a variance as possible (that
   is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding
   component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it be
 5 orthogonal to (uncorrelated with) the preceding components. Principal components
   are guaranteed to be independent only if the data set is jointly normally distributed.
   PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables. Depending on the
   field of application, it is also named the discrete Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT),
   the Hotelling transform or proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Alternatively to
10 PCA, MDS or any other type of well-established multivariate analysis, can be used
   (see: Pedreira et al. Trends Biotechnol 2013).
   In one embodiment, there is provided is a multi-color flow cytometric method for
15 detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) in a biological sample comprising
   lymphocytes, wherein MRD is BCP-ALL, comprising the steps of:
   (i)     staining the sample with a BCP-ALL reagent composition according to the
   invention, preferably a composition selected from any one of panels 1A, 1B or 1C,;
   (ii)    subjecting the sample to flow cytometry; (iii) gating on mature B cells and
20 BCP-cells for expression of the markers detected by the antibodies present in the
   reagent composition; (iv)       distinction between normal and malignant BCP cells,
   based on the application of multiple markers, each having added value in the
   distinction process via the principal component analysis. See examples in Example 1
   and Figures 1 and 2 for an exemplary analysis allowing for detection of MRD in BCP
25 ALL patients.
   In another embodiment, there is provided is a multi-color flow cytometric method for
   detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) in a biological sample comprising
   lymphocytes, wherein MRD is CLL, comprising the steps of:
30 (i)     staining the sample with a CLL reagent composition according to the
   invention, preferably a composition selected from any one of panels 2A, 2B or 2C;
   (ii)    subjecting the sample to flow cytometry; (iii)     gating B-lymphocytes for
   expression of the markers detected by the antibodies present in the reagent

                                             13
   composition; (iv)      distinction between normal and malignant B cells, based on the
   application of multiple markers, each having added value in the distinction process
   via the principal component analysis.
   See examples in Example 2 and Figures 3 and 4 for an exemplary analysis allowing
 5 for detection of MRD in CLL patients.
   In yet another embodiment, there is provided is a multi-color flow cytometric method
   for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) in a biological sample comprising
10 lymphocytes, wherein MRD is MM/PCD, comprising the steps of:
   (i)     staining the sample with a MM/PCD reagent composition according to the
   invention, preferably a composition selected from any one of panels 3A, 3B or 3C;
   (ii)    subjecting the sample to flow cytometry; (iii) gating plasma cells for expression
   of the markers detected by the antibodies present in the reagent composition; (iv)

   for detection of MRD in MM/PCD patients.

   EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
   The power of the EuroFlow approach disclosed herein is based on the combination of
   sets of markers and the usage of multivariate analyses for both the identification of
30 normal cells (e.g. normal precursor B-cells, normal B-lymphocytes and normal plasma
   cells) and the distinction between normal/reactive cells vs. clonal/malignant cells. For
   this purpose, a powerful multivariate analysis of the contribution of individual
   markers for inclusion and exclusion of each marker in the panel according to its

                                             16
   contribution over all other markers in the combination. Such a strategy was used to
   evaluate the selected combinations of most discriminating markers in multiple
   sequential rounds of experimental testing. Because of this the final proposed antibody
   combinations became extremely strong when used in combination with the principal
 5 component analysis, specifically with the automated population separation (APS) tool
   of the Infinicyt software, so that the added (independent) value of each marker is used
   in a single step of analysis.
   Herewith we provided the summary of the results of the extensive experimental
10 studies for MRD detection in blood and bone marrow of patients with BCP-ALL
   (Example 1), CLL (Example 2) and Multiple Myeloma (Example 3).
   In the Examples below, lists of markers are provided together with the most frequent
   phenotypic aberration of these markers in case of BCP-ALL, CLL, and MM/PCD.
15 However, it should be noted that the real discrimination power between normal and
   malignant cells is based on combinations of markers in the corresponding n
   dimensional space, as is clearly visible in the principle component analyses in the
   figures of Examples 1 to 3. In fact, minor differences of several markers add up to a
   larger difference in principle component analysis. Therefore the current invention is
20 not about single marker studies for MRD detection, but about carefully selected sets
   of markers, that allow excellent discrimination between normal cells and their
   malignant counterparts, such as normal BCP cells vs. BCP-ALL blasts, normal B
   lymphocytes vs. B-CLL cells, and normal plasma cells vs. MM/PCD plasma cells.

   Markers for identification of total B cells and B-cell precursors in the bone
 5 marrow
   List of relevant identification markers: CD19, CD45
   How to use them: Pre-gating using the CD19 marker is essential for identifying a
   pure B-cell population. To focus on normal B-cell precursors (BCP), CD45-negativity
   or weak positivity can be used to discriminate BCP from CD45-positive mature B
10 cells. In case of CD19-directed therapies, CD19 might be replaced by CD22. These
   markers may be used in combination also with sideward light scatter (SSC) or
   forward light scatter (FSC) or both FSC and SSC to identify B-cells in peripheral
   blood or bone marrow or other types of samples (e.g. bone marrow, tissue biopsy,
   spinal fluid). Of note, other markers, like CD10, CD20, CD38 and CD34, which are
15 used for discriminating BCP-ALL cells from normal BCP cells (see below), may also
   contribute to the gating of the total BCP cell population (e.g. CD34+, CD10+, CD20-to
   dim, CD38+).
