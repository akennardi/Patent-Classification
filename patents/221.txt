Dear Sir/Madam,
I am applying for innovative patent for Referral system mobile app and
website, where end users have ability to list their product and services
and nominate referral amount.
The system works on unique algorithm which works on hopping concept
where every user can do 10 hops per product and if within the chain user
does not refer it further that chain does not go ahead

Abstract
Rippleitt is developing referral system to simplify how we refer products and
services to our family and friends and also get rewarded for successful referral.
This system includes referral algorithm with data repository, related to users,
products, buyers, sellers, wallet, address book, shopping cart, payment portal,
reviews of products and also sellers, email and SMS notification
With initial stage, we will be using Australian Dollars as currency and Referral
points and as system grows we will implement cryptocurrency or similar
technologies for trading goods and services within system and with external
vendors.
Algorithm works in a manner where referral cannot be duplicated there is one
to one relationship between user, product and referral chain. Once product or
services are successfully purchased referral amount will be distributes within
successful chain equally.
System is developed without any regional limitation which makes it scalable
within Australia and beyond with integration of different payment method.

                                          2
Technical Field
[0001] Referral system is applicable in more than one field predominantly use
will be in new or users products, services, travel, employment, hotel, real
estate industries.
BACKGROUND
[0002] Traditionally referral process uses word of mouth or sharing reference
though email, phone, or other communication method, but there is no way of
tracking if referral was successful or unless its confirmed manually
[0003] People often refer goods and services to known person or groups
without any expectation of monetary benefits or rewards, though there might
be reward available for positive reference but due to lack of awareness or
visibility
[0004] There is no formal process to identify if one or more than one person is
involved in referral process. Another challenge is distribution of referral
amount as there is no way to trace referral process and who was involved in
referring goods and services
[0005] On the other hand companies pay listing fee for their services, market
their products in digital media, radio, television claiming their reach to
potential customer, which can be expensive and time-consuming exercise
without any guarantee it will reach to right consumer of the product or services
[0006] Referral method has been age old and trusted method of referring
goods and services to friends and family and potentially reaches to right
consumer of these goods and services, but there is no formal system to reward
people who successfully refer goods and services

                                          3
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
[0007] Development of referral platform where anyone can list goods or
services and nominate reward amount for successful referral.
[0008] In this platform every listing will have referral amount which then users
can share within their network through link, tagging them through their phone
number or email address
[0009] Once user is tagged in the referral chain for a product he/she cannot
start new chain, when they refer they will extend this chain. First user who
initiates referral chain can create multiple chains, for now we have restricted to
10 referrals chain per product per user.
[0010] Chain will work on hopping concept, where every user can tag 10
people for one product they my be within system or outside, unique identifier
will be email address which will be used for registration
[0011] For Successful chain, nominated referral amount will be distributes
equally throughout the referral chain.
DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS
[0012] Various embodiments of the invention is described with reference to
the drawing in Figure 1
[0013] Figure 1 illustrates referral system according to an embodiment of
present invention

                                          4
[0014] Figure 2 illustrates user registration screen with his email address and
location
 [0015] Figure 3 illustrates user listing screens, where they can list and
manage existing listings.
[0016] Figure 4 illustrates buyers bids on the listed product or services
[0017] Figure 5 illustrates buyers search and home screen, here buyers can
search for required products and services
[0018] Figure 6 illustrates screen where user can generate unique link to share
through email, text or whats app
[0019] Figure 7 illustrates user chat screen, here buyers can chat with seller
[0020] Figure 8 illustrates payment screen, here buyer will make payment to
buy products or services
[0021] Figure 9 illustrates review and rating process, this is the place where
buyer will leave review and rating about seller and product
DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0022] Figure 1 illustrates complete referral system   according to the
embodiment of the intention, this solution works on unique algorithm of
tagging people within referral system until it reaches buyer
[0023] Figure 1 Seller 101 can list product or services through mobile app or
website 102

                                         5
[0024] User 103 then refers product to their network, in Figure 1 user 103 has
created 2 referral chains 104 and 113
[0025] In referral chain 104 second user 105 tagged 106 and 106 tagged 107,
here 107 was able to reach buyer 108 who bought this product or service, and
all users 103, 105, 106 & 107 got rewarded with referral amount
[0026] Referral chain two 113 was also initiated by user 103, which went to 4
more users, 109, 110, 111, 112 but as they were not able to find buyer no one
was rewarded within chain two, only user 103 got rewarded due to successful
referral chain 104
[0027] 117 Referral Algorithm manages referral system, based on key
components which are products and services, users and referral chain
[0028] 117 Referral algorithm gets data from 118 database which hold several
tables, user, product, buyers, referral details, messages, wallet, reviews &
ratings and address book
[0027] Notification engine 116 controls, messaging 115, payments 114,
reviews and rating 120, and any notification generated from referral algorithm
117
[0028] Cloud server 119 holds database, referral algorithm and notification
engine, also codes and designs for website and mobile app 102
