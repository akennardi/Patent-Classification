   Field of the Invention
   [001]    The field of the invention relates to aircraft flight control, and more particularly to
 5 aircraft flight control of rotary fixed-wing aircraft.
   Description of the Related Art
   [001a] Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
   considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
   general knowledge in the field.
10 [002]    Many applications exist for remotely or autonomously-piloted unmanned aerial
   vehicles (UAVs) that are able to take off, loiter, and land without the benefit of a runway.
   Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicles address this limitation and may come in the
   form of hand-launched aerial vehicles having a main wing and a vertical/horizontal tail
   control surfaces, or three or four-rotor copters that are operable to take off and land
15 vertically. Aerial vehicles having a main wing and vertical/horizontal tail control surfaces
   tend to be more efficient and faster in cruise, while rotor copters are less efficient in forward
   flight but have takeoff and landing advantages.
   [003]    A need continues to exist to design and manufacturer aerial vehicles that are efficient
   in flight and that can takeoff and land vertically.
20                                            SUMMARY
   [004]    A flight control apparatus is disclosed for fixed-wing aircraft that includes a first port
   wing and a first starboard wing, a first port swash plate coupled between a first port rotor and
   a first port electric motor, the first port electric motor coupled to the first port wing, and a
   first starboard swash plate coupled between a first starboard rotor and a first starboard
25 electric motor, the first starboard electric motor coupled to the first starboard wing. The
   apparatus may also include a second port wing and second starboard wing, a second port
   swash plate coupled between a second port rotor and second port electric motor, the second
   port electric motor coupled to the second port wing, and a second starboard swash plate
   coupled between a second starboard rotor and second starboard electric motor, the second

   apparatus may include a horizontal stabilizer coupled to a fuselage and an elevator rotatably
   coupled to the horizontal stabilizer, the fuselage coupled between the first port wing and
   second starboard wing, and may include a port aileron rotatably disposed on a trailing edge of

   starboard wing. The apparatus may include first and second landing gear attached to the first
   port wing and first starboard wing, respectively, and may include a third landing gear
   attached to the horizontal stabilizer.
 5 [005]   A method of flight control for fixed-wing aircraft is also disclosed that includes

   wing, and ii) generating in a first starboard rotor a negative rotational moment in response to
10 actuation of a first starboard swash plate, the first starboard rotor rotatably coupled to the first
   starboard wing. In some embodiments, the method may include generating asymmetric
   collective control between the first port rotor and the first starboard rotor to induce a yaw
   moment about the fuselage. When used together, the asymmetric collective control, positive
   rotational moment and negative rotational moment can enable a coordinated turn of the port
15 and starboard wings. In one embodiment, the method may also include inducing a left roll of
   a fuselage in response to generating in the first port rotor a negative rotational moment in
   response to actuation of the first port swash plate and generating in the starboard rotor a
   positive rotational moment in response to actuation of the first starboard swash plate. The
   method may also include providing pitch control of the fuselage in response to asymmetric

   differential angular velocities (RPM) between the first starboard rotor and a second starboard
   rotor rotatably coupled to a second starboard wing. Further embodiments may include
   providing elevator control complementary to the providing pitch control to supplement the
   pitching moment with an additional pitching moment. In one embodiment, the method may

   second starboard rotor rotatably coupled to a second starboard wing so that the positive and
   negative moments of force generated in the second port rotor and second starboard rotor
   induce a right roll of the second port and second starboard wings. The method may also
   include supplementing the right roll of the fuselage in response to actuating port and
 5 starboard ailerons rotatably coupled to the second port wing and second starboard wing,
   respectively.

   control to accomplish transition of the first port and first starboard wings from vertical
   takeoff to horizontal flight, and may include generating thrust in a second port rotor driven by
15 a second port electric motor on a second port wing and a second starboard rotor driven by a
   second starboard motor on a second starboard wing. The fuselage may be transitioned from
   vertical takeoff to horizontal flight in a number of disclosed embodiments, including i) in
   response to asymmetric collective control as between the first port rotor and first starboard
   rotor on the one hand and the second port rotor and the second starboard rotor on the other
20 hand, and ii) in response to differential rotor angular velocity control (RPM) control as
   between the first port rotor and first starboard rotor on the one hand and the second port rotor
   and the second starboard rotor on the other. Horizontal thrust may be provided in response to
   generating symmetric cyclic control of the first port rotor, first starboard rotor, second port
   rotor, and second starboard rotor or in response to generating differential thrust of at least one
25 pair of rotors selected from the group consisting of: i) first and second port rotors on the one
   hand and first and second starboard rotors on the other hand, ii) first port rotor and first
   starboard rotor on the one hand and second port rotor and second starboard rotor on the other

   other hand, ii) first port rotor and first starboard rotor on the one hand and second port rotor
   and second starboard rotor on the other hand so that generating differential thrust in
                                                     3

   combination with the generating symmetric cyclic control induces the fuselage to remain
   stationary and at a pitch or roll angle with respect to horizontal.

                                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   [022]    A vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) air vehicle is disclosed with one or more
   wings that can take off and land vertically using a two or more rotors that are operable to lift
 5 the air vehicle vertically upwards, transition the air vehicle to horizontal flight, and then
   transition it back to vertical flight to land the air vehicle vertically downwards. During
   vertical flight, the wing(s) may be orientated vertically and so not contribute vertical lift
   while the vehicle is moving up or down (e.g., the wings are pointed upwards). When airborne,
   the air vehicle can translate horizontally while maintaining in its vertical orientation, at least
10 substantially (e.g., sliding from side-to-side), and may transition to forward flight by using its
   rotors to rotate the air vehicle from an at least generally vertical to an at least generally
   horizontal orientation and then back to an at least generally vertical flight from an at least
   generally horizontal flight for landing. In forward flight, the one or more wings generate lift
   and the rotors are directed to propel the vehicle generally forward. In this manner, the air
15 vehicle can utilize the efficiency of lift generated by a wing while in forward flight to
   maximize endurance, but does not require a lengthy horizontal runway to take off and land
   given the capability to take off and land vertically.
   [023]    In embodiments, attitudinal control for the vehicle comes entirely from the means of
   propulsion without the benefit of aerodynamic control surfaces, such as ailerons, an elevator,
20 or rudder. Without control surfaces on the structure of the vehicle (which typically are placed
   at the trailing edges of the wing or stabilizer), the vehicle is lighter, more efficient
   (aerodynamic), more reliable, less complex and generally more rugged. Being more rugged
   allows the air vehicle to be subjected to physical conditions and handling that a vehicle with
   control surfaces would not typically or otherwise be subject to without damage or potential
25 adverse effects on its control and operation. For example, an air vehicle without control
   surfaces on its structure could land vertically into bushes or rocky terrain without potential
   for later flight control problems due to damaged flight control surfaces. Likewise, without
   control surfaces the air vehicle requires less maintenance and is less susceptible to being
   damaged in handling, such as when being moved about on board a ship. Without control
30 surfaces on the air vehicle, drag is reduced. In other embodiments, some control surfaces may
   be provided to supplement attitudinal control that is otherwise provided by the means of
   propulsion.
   [024]    In embodiments, the means for propulsion is at least two rotors rotatably attached to a
   wing through respective electric motors and each including a swash plate that can provide
                                                     6

   pitch, yaw and roll control of the air vehicle by varying blade rotation rate (rpm) and/or blade
   pitch, such as with either/or cyclic or collective pitch control. In vertical flight (or at least
   generally vertical) a majority of the lift, attitudinal control, and propulsion may be generated
   by the at least two propellers; and in horizontal flight (or at least generally horizontal) the
 5 majority of lift may be generated by the wing surfaces, and vehicle attitudinal control and
   propulsion may be generated by the at least two rotors. That is, for horizontal flight, the air
   vehicle's pitch, yaw, and roll control would be provided through the differential thrust and
   rotational moments created by the at least two rotors, each rotor consisting of at least two or
   three rotatable rotor blades having controllably variable pitch through the use of, for example,
10 a swash plate having two or three axes of control. In embodiments, aerodynamic control
   surfaces, such as an elevator and ailerons, may be provided to supplement attitudinal control
   in vertical and horizontal flight.
   [025]   FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of a two-rotor fixed wing air vehicle 100 that may have
   a fuselage 110 coupled between port and starboard wings (115, 120), and including port and
15 starboard rotors (125, 130).     The port and starboard rotors (125, 130) are coupled to and
   driven by respective port and starboard electronic motors (135, 140) through respective port
   and starboard swash plates (145, 150) that provide collective control and, preferably, single
   axis cyclic pitch control of the rotor blades 155. In another embodiment, the swash plates
   (135, 150) may provide for collective control and two-axis cyclic pitch control of the rotor
20 blades 155. In a further embodiment, the port and starboard wings (115, 120) have port and
   starboard elevons (160, 165) spanning approximately the rotor wash behind the port and
   starboard rotors (125, 130), respectively, to supplemental pitch and/or roll attitudinal control
   of the aircraft 100. For example, if supplementary pitch control is desired, such as for use in
   the transition between vertical flight and horizontal flight, the elevons (160, 165) would be
25 actuated in a "flap-down" configuration to induce a pitch-forward moment in the aircraft.
   Similarly, if supplementary roll control is desired, the elevons (160, 165) may be operated as
   ailerons would be on a conventional wing and vertical/horizontal stabilizers aircraft. For
   forward and backwards transitioning of the air vehicle during vertical flight, the elevons (160,
    165) may be used to maintain (at least generally) the vertical orientation of the air vehicle by
30 generating a moment counteracting the lift generated by the wing with the airflow over it
   from the prop wash.
   [026]   The aircraft is illustrated as disposed initially on the ground on its landing gear 170
   and oriented in a vertical position at landed position A. Vertical take-off of the aircraft 100 is
   accomplished as vertical thrust is supplied by the first port rotor 125 and first starboard rotor
                                                     7

    130, as driven by the first port electric motor and the first starboard motor, respectively (135,
    140). The rotors (125, 130) are operable to develop symmetric or differential thrust (X1, X2)
   using angular velocity control or collective control inputs, and symmetric or differential
   rotational moments using cyclic control inputs, to collectively enable pitch, roll, yaw and
 5 vertical/horizontal acceleration. For purposes of this application, the inertial frame of
   reference is provided in FIG. 2C and vertical/horizontal directions provided in FIG. 1.
   [027]    The air vehicle may transition from the landed position (position A) to vertical flight
   and then to horizontal flight (position B) where a majority of lift is provided by the wings
   (115, 120). Attitudinal control (pitch, roll, yaw) may be provided during both vertical flight
10 and horizontal flight by the rotors (125, 130) as respective pitches of the rotor blades 155 are
   guided by the swash plates (145, 150) and as the rotors (125, 130) are rotationally driven by
   the electric motors (135, 140). Horizontal thrust (Y1 , Y2) during horizontal flight is sufficient
   to overcome parasitic and induced drag of the wings (115, 120) and fuselage 110 during
   cruise, loitering and further horizontal configuration ascent.
15 [028]    FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C are starboard plan, top and perspective views, respectively,
   illustrating pitch up, yaw right and roll flight control forces, respectively, of the two-rotor
   aircraft. As shown in the side view of FIG. 2A, with the air vehicle 100 in forward flight, a
   greater thrust TI may be created below the center of the rotor(s) and thus below the center of
   mass M of the air vehicle 100 than the thrust T2 produced above the center of the rotor(s) and
20 the center of mass M of the air vehicle 100 using cyclic control of the rotors (125, 130) by
   means of swash plates (145, 150). In some embodiments the hub and/or rotor blades can be
   hinged or gimbaled so that as the swash plate (145, 150) moves the rotor will displace at an
   angle relative to its initial position (or to the air vehicle), associated with the swash plate
   displacement, resulting in the thrust vector being angled relative to its initial position (e.g.,
25 directly forward), where a component of this angled force vector will impart a force on the air
   vehicle to cause it to rotate (e.g., pitch).      The differential forces created and resulting
   rotational moments will cause the air vehicle 100 to pitch up, if negative rotational moments
   are created from the cyclic control inputs, or pitch down, if positive rotational moments are
   created from the cyclic control inputs.      Similarly, a right roll of the fuselage 110 may be
30 induced if the port rotor 125 generates a positive rotational moment in response to actuation
   of the port swash plate 145 and the starboard rotor 130 generates a negative rotational
   moment in response to actuation of the starboard swash plate 150.
   [029]    In FIG. 2B, the air vehicle is illustrated during forward flight in its horizontal flight
   orientation, with yaw control affected by differential thrust (XPORT, XSTARBOARD) of the
                                                     8

   port and starboard rotors (125, 130). In its horizontal flight orientation, differential thrust
   (XPORT, XSTARBOARD) of the rotors (125,                  130) may be accomplished through
   asymmetric collective control provided by the port and starboard swash plates (145, 150)
   and/or, in a non-preferred embodiment, by differential motor angular rate control (rotor
 5 RPM) of the port and starboard rotors (125, 130) using control of the port and starboard
   electric motors (135, 140). For example, a right-hand yaw moment (yaw to the starboard
   side) may be induced by i) increasing thrust generated by the port rotor 125, ii) decreasing
   thrust generated by the starboard rotor 130, or by iii) both increasing thrust generated by the
   port rotor 125 and decreasing thrust generated by the starboard rotor 130. Increased thrust
10 generated by a particular rotor may be accomplished by increasing pitch angles of associated
   rotor blades 155 through collective actuation or, in a non-preferred embodiment, by
   increasing angular rotation (RPM) of the particular rotor as driven by the associated electric
   motor. Similarly, decreased thrust generated by a particular rotor may be accomplished by
   decreasing pitch angles of associated rotor blades 155 through collective actuation or by
15 decreasing angular rotation (RPM) of the particular rotor as driven by the associated electric
   motor.
   [030]    In an alternative embodiment, symmetric cyclic control may be provided by the port
   rotor 125 and starboard rotor 130 to produce asymmetric left and right positioned blade
   thrusts (illustrated with dashed lines) to produce a net yaw right of moment. More
20 particularly, port swash plate 145 actuates asymmetric blade pitch in the port rotor 125 such
   that blades passing left (region 155a) of the port rotor 125 generate greater thrust than blades
   passing right (region 155b) of the port rotor 125. Similarly, blades passing left (region 155a)
   of the starboard rotor 130 generate greater thrust than blades passing right (region 155b) of
   the starboard rotor 130, with all blades collectively generating a net yaw right of the fuselage
25  110 through the port and starboard wings (115, 120).
   [031] FIG. 2C is a perspective view illustrating cyclic control of the rotors producing left
   roll of the fuselage. In one embodiment, the left roll of the fuselage is induced in response to
   generating in the first port rotor 125 a negative rotational moment MPORT in response to
   actuation of the first port swash plate 145 and generating in the first starboard rotor 130 a
30 positive rotational moment MSTARBOARD in response to actuation of the first starboard swash
   plate 150. Similarly, to affect a right roll on the fuselage, a positive rotational moment may
   be generated in the first port rotor in response to actuation of the first port wash plate and a
   negative rotational moment in the starboard rotor in response to actuation of the first
   starboard swash plate. The up pitch on the right wing and the down pitch on the left wing
                                                    9

   causes the air vehicle 100 to roll to the left (as viewed from behind). Similarly, reversing
   these pitch forces may induce the air vehicle 100 to roll to the right. Also illustrated in FIG.
   2C are horizontal thrust components T3, T4, T5, and T6 and indicate thrust magnitudes of
   associated blades 155 at the illustrated rotor blade positions, along with associated vertical
 5 thrust vector components Zi (starboard wing), Z2 (port wing).
   [032]    FIG. 3A describes embodiments of pitch, roll, yaw and thrust effector inputs along
   with associated force vectors and graphical representations of the two-rotor fixed wing
   aircraft illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2. In row 1 of FIG. 3A, a front plan view of the aircraft 100
   is provided to illustrate one embodiment of nose up positive pitch control of the fuselage 110
10 through the port and starboard wings (115, 120). Pitch up may be induced using symmetric
   pitch cyclic control, such as by generating in the port and starboard rotors (125, 130)
   respective positive (and equal) rotational moments in response to actuation of port and
   starboard swash plates, respectively, that results in a pitch up force as indicated with two
   vertical force lines. Left plan and right plan views of the air vehicle 100 are also provided
15 illustrating a net nose up force vector generated from the nose up symmetric pitch cyclic
   control.
   [033]    In row 2 of FIG. 3A, a front plan view of the aircraft 100 is provided to illustrate a
   right (positive) roll of the fuselage.        The right (positive) roll may be induced using
   asymmetric cyclic control of the port and starboard rotors (125, 130), such as by generating
20 in the port rotor 125 a positive rotational moment in response to suitable actuation of the port
   swash plate and generating in the starboard rotor a negative rotational moment in response to
   suitable actuation of the starboard swash plate. Although not illustrated in FIG. 3A, a left roll
   of the fuselage may also be provided using asymmetric cyclic control of port and starboard
   rotors (125, 130). For example, a negative rotational moment may be generated in the port
25 rotor in response to suitable actuation of the port swash plate, and a positive rotational
   moment generated in the starboard rotor in response to suitable actuation of the starboard
   swash plate, resulting in the left roll of the fuselage 110. Asymmetric control of elevons may
   also supplement left roll of the fuselage (see FIG. 2B), such as by extending the port elevon
    160 up to reduce lift on the port wing 115 and extending the starboard elevon 165 down to
30 increase lift on the starboard wing 165.
   [034]    In row 3 of FIG. 3A, a top plan view of the aircraft 100 is provided to illustrate right
   (positive) yaw of the fuselage. The yaw may be induced using differential thrust of the port
   and starboard rotors (125,       130). Such differential thrust may be provided by either
   asymmetric collective control or differential rotational speed control of the port and starboard
                                                     10

   rotors (125, 130).   As illustrated in line 3 of FIG. 3A, nose right yaw (positive) may be
   induced about the fuselage by the port rotor 125 providing more thrust than the starboard
   rotor 130. Similarly, nose left yaw (negative) may be induced about the fuselage by the port
   rotor 125 providing less thrust than the collective rotor 130. In one embodiment, differential
 5 thrust is provided using differential rates of rotation of the port and starboard rotors (125,
    130), such as would be provided by port and starboard electric motors (135, 140) driving the
   port and starboard rotors (125, 130) at different revolutions-per-minute (RPMs). In another
   embodiment described in FIG. 3A, asymmetric collective control of the rotors (125, 130) are
   used to provide differential thrust, such as by providing greater relative collective control of
10 the port rotor 125 and less relative collective control of the starboard rotor 130.
   [035]   In row 4 of FIG. 3A, a top plan view of the aircraft 100 is also provided to illustrate
   one embodiment of application of thrust. In one embodiment, thrust adjustments may be
   made using symmetric collective (forward positive) control of the rotors (125, 130).        The
   rotors (125, 130) may be driven at a constant angular rotation rate by port and starboard
15 electric motors (135, 140), with rotor thrust varied by collective blade pitch adjustments
   made by respective port and starboard swash plates (145, 150). In order to increase forward
   thrust, the port and starboard swash plates (145, 150) may increase respective collective
   control inputs to increase the pitch of each blade 155 in a symmetric manner. In order to
   decrease forward thrust, the port and starboard swash plates (145, 150) may decrease
20 respective collective control inputs to decrease the pitch of each blade 155 in a symmetric
   manner.
   [036]   FIGS. 3B and 3C are tables describing different flight control effector embodiments
   available to accomplish pitch in horizontal or vertical flight, roll, yaw, and coordinated turns
   for the two-rotor fixed-wing aircraft illustrated in FIGS. 1, 2A, 2B, and 2C, along with
25 associated graphics illustrating associated forces. Pitch and pitch to/from vertical flight
   control may be accomplished by means of at least two effector embodiments.                    In
   Embodiment 1 (line 1), symmetric cyclic control inputs may be provided as between the port
   and starboard rotors (125, 130). For example, pitch-up control of the fuselage 110 may be
   induced in response to generating a positive rotational moment in each of the port and
30 starboard rotors (125, 130) (i.e., symmetric cyclic rotor control) in response to suitable
   symmetric actuation of respective port and starboard swash plates (145, 150). Similarly, pitch
   down control of the fuselage 110 may be induced in response to generating a negative
   rotational moment in each of the port and starboard rotors (125, 130) in response to suitable
   symmetric actuation of respective port and starboard swash plates (145, 150). In Embodiment
                                                    11

   2 of pitch and pitch to/from vertical flight control illustrated in FIG. 3C, such pitch effector
   control may be supplemented using symmetric actuation of port and starboard elevons (160,
    165).  For example, if port and starboard rotors (125, 130) are inducing pitch up of the
   fuselage 110, the port and starboard elevons may be actuated symmetrically (i.e.,
 5 substantially similar effector control inputs) to provide additional fuselage pitch-up force.
   [037]   Roll control may be accomplished in at least two different effector control
   embodiments. In Embodiment 1 illustrated in FIG. 3B (line 2), asymmetric cyclic control of
   the port and starboard rotors (125, 130) may induce a roll of the fuselage. For example, a left
   roll of the fuselage 110 may be induced by generating negative and positive rotational
10 moments in port and starboard rotors (125, 130), respectively, in response to actuation of port
   and starboard swash plates (145, 150), respectively. Similarly, a right roll of the fuselage
   may be induced by generating positive and negative rotational moments in port and starboard
   rotors (125, 130) respectively, in response to actuation of the port and starboard swash plates
   (145, 150), respectively. In Embodiment 2 of the aircraft's roll effector control illustrated in
15 FIG. 3C, the asymmetric cyclic control of the port and starboard rotors (125, 130) may be
   supplemented by complementary asymmetric actuation of the port and starboard elevons (160,
    165). For example, if port and starboard rotors (125, 130) are inducing a left roll, then the
   port and starboard elevons (160, 165) may be actuated asymmetrically to provide additional
   fuselage left roll force, similar in operation to aileron control in aircraft having more typical
20 aileron and fin/elevator control surfaces.
   [038]   Yaw control may be accomplished with at least three different effector control
   embodiments. In Embodiment 1 described in FIG. 3B (line 3), a yaw moment may be
   induced about the fuselage 110 in response to generating asymmetric collective control
   (alternatively referred to as "asymmetric collective" control) between the port and starboard
25 rotors (125, 130). For example, a right (positive) yaw may be induced by increasing relative
   collective control of the port rotor 125 and/or decreasing relative collective control of the
   starboard rotor 130 assuming straight and steady-state initial flight attitude. Similarly, a left
   (negative) yaw may be induced about the fuselage 110 by decreasing relative collective
   control of the port rotor 125 and/or increasing relative collective control of the starboard rotor
30  130.
   [039]   In Embodiment 2 (line 3) illustrate in FIG. 3C, yaw control may be accomplished
   using differential motor RPM control of the port and starboard electric motors (135, 140)
   driving respective port and starboard rotors (125, 130). For example, a right (positive) yaw
   may be induced about the fuselage 110 by increasing the RPM of port rotor 125, by means of
                                                    12

   a proportional increase in the RPM of the port electric motor 135, and/or decreasing the RPM
   of the starboard rotor 130 by means of a proportional decrease in the RPM of the starboard
   electric motor 140. Similarly, a left (negative) yaw may be induced about the fuselage 110 by
   and decreasing the RPM of the port rotor 125 by means of a proportional decrease in the
 5 RPM of the port electric motor 135, and/or increasing the RPM of the starboard rotor 130 by
   means of a proportional increase in the RPM of the starboard electric motor 140.
   [040]   In Embodiment 3 (line 3) illustrated in FIG. 3C, yaw control may be accomplished
   using asymmetric collective control of the port and starboard rotors (125,            130) with
   differential motor RPM control of the port and starboard electric motors (135, 140). For
10 example, a right (positive) yaw may be induced in the fuselage 110 by increasing collective
   control of the port rotor 125 and/or decreasing relative collective control of the starboard
   rotor 130 in association with increased motor RPM control of the port electric motor 135
   and/or decreased motor RPM control of the starboard electric motor 140. Similarly, a left
   (negative) yaw may be induced in the fuselage 110 by decreasing collective control of the
15 port rotor on 25 and/or increasing relative collective control of the starboard rotor 130 in
   association with decreased motor RPM control of the port electric motor 135 and/or increased
   motor RPM control of the starboard electric motor 140.
   [041]           FIGS. 3B and 3C also describes at least four different effector control
   embodiments that may be used to accomplish coordinated turns using the inventive system
20 described herein. In Embodiment 1 described in FIG. 3B (line 4), a coordinated turn of the
   port and starboard wings may be accomplished by using asymmetric cyclic control of port
   and starboard rotors (125,     130) approximately concurrently with asymmetric collective
   control of the port and starboard rotors (125, 130). For example, to accomplish a coordinated
   right turn, asymmetric cyclic control of port and starboard rotors (125,          130) may be
25 accomplished by generating in the port rotor 125 a positive rotational moment and generating
   in the starboard rotor 130 a negative rotational moment, each approximately concurrently
   with increasing collective control of the port rotor 125 and/or decreasing collective control of
   the starboard rotor 130. In another example, to accomplish a coordinated left turn,
   asymmetric cyclic control of port and starboard rotors (125, 130) may be accomplished by
30 generating in the port rotor 125 a negative rotational moment and generating in the starboard
   rotor 130 a positive rotational moment, each approximately concurrently with decreasing
   collective control of the port rotor 125 and/or increasing collective control of the starboard
   rotor 130.
                                                   13

   [042]    In Embodiment 2 (line 4) illustrated in FIG. 3C, the coordinated turn may be
   accomplished by using asymmetric port and starboard elevons (160, 165) and approximately
   concurrent asymmetric collective control of port and starboard rotors (125, 130). For example,
   to accomplish a coordinated right turn, port elevon 160 may be actuated to induce increased
 5 lift in the port wing 115 and starboard elevon 165 actuated to induce decreased lift in the
   starboard wing 120 each approximately concurrently with increased collective control of the
   port rotor 125 and/or decreased relative collective control of the starboard rotor 130.
   Similarly, to accomplish a coordinated left turn, port elevon 160 may be actuated to induce
   decreased lift in the port wing 115 and starboard elevon 165 actuated to induce increased left
10 in the starboard wing 120, each approximately concurrently with decreased collective control
   of the port rotor 125 and/or increased relative collective control of the starboard rotor 130.
   [043]    In Embodiment 3 (line 4) illustrated in FIG. 3C, the coordinated turn may be
   accomplished by using i) asymmetric cyclic control of the port and starboard rotors (125,
    130) with approximately concurrent ii) asymmetric collective control of the port and
15 starboard rotors (125, 130) and iii) asymmetric control of port and starboard elevons (160,
    165). For example, a coordinated right turn may be accomplished in accordance with the
   right turn described above for Embodiment 2, and with the additional asymmetric cyclic
   control of port and starboard rotors (125, 130) such as by generating in the port and starboard
   rotors (125, 130) positive and negative rotational moments, respectively, in response to
20 actuation of the port and starboard swash plates (145,          150), respectively. Similarly, a
   coordinated left turn may be accomplished in accordance with the left turn described above
   for and Embodiment 2, and with the additional asymmetric cyclic control of port and
   starboard rotors (125, 130) such as by generating in the port and starboard rotors (125, 130)
   negative and positive rotational moments, respectively in response to actuation of the port
25 and starboard swash plates (145, 150), respectively.
   [044]    In Embodiment 4 (line 4) of FIG. 3C, the coordinated control may be accomplished
   by using i) asymmetric cyclic control of the port and starboard rotors (125, 130) with
   approximately concurrent ii) asymmetric actuation of the port and starboard elevons (160,
    165); and with iii) differential motor RPM control of the port and starboard electric motors
30 (135, 140).
   [045]    FIGS. 3B and 3C also describe at least three different effector control embodiments
   that may be used to accomplish a slow horizontal translation using the inventive system
   described herein. In Embodiment 1 (line 5), the slow horizontal translation may be
   accomplished by using symmetric cyclic (non-zero) rotor control of port and starboard rotors.
                                                   14

   In Embodiment 2 (line 5) illustrated in FIG. 3C, the slow horizontal translation may be
    accomplished using i) symmetric cyclicle (non-zero) rotor control of all rotors, and ii) elevon
   control maintain a more vertical orientation of the aircraft.        In Embodiment 3 (line 5)
    illustrated in FIG. 3C, horizontal translation may be accomplished using asymmetric
 5 collective control of the port rotor vs. the starboard rotor.
    [046]    Although FIGS. 3A and 3B are described primarily in relation to a two-rotor fixed
   wing aircraft 100, in a non-preferred embodiment such effector control inputs may be utilized
   to also provide attitudinal and thrust control of a four-rotor fixed-wing aircraft having two
   wings and a horizontal stabilizer/elevator configuration, such as that illustrated in FIGS. 4A,
10 4B, and 4C. In such an application, effector controls would preferably reside on one of the
   two main wings of the four-rotor fixed-wing aircraft.
    [047]    FIGS. 4A, 4B, and 4C are front plan, top plan and port plan views, respectively, of
    another embodiment of a fixed-wing aircraft that has four rotors and is operable for vertical
   takeoff and landing. An aft main wing 401 has aft port and aft starboard wings (402, 404)
15 joined at a fuselage 406. A forward main wing 408 has forward port and forward starboard
   wings (410, 412) also joined at the fuselage 406. An aft port swash plate 414 is coupled
   between an aft port rotor 416 and an aft port electric motor 418, the aft port electric motor
   418 coupled to the aft port wing 402. An aft starboard swash plate 420 is coupled between an
    aft starboard rotor 422 and an aft starboard electric motor 424, the aft starboard electric motor
20 420 coupled to the aft starboard wing 404. A forward port swash plate 426 may be coupled
   between a forward port rotor 428 and forward port electric motor 430, the forward port
    electric motor 430 coupled to the forward port wing 410. A forward starboard swash plate
   432 may be coupled between a forward starboard rotor 434 and forward starboard electric
   motor 436, the forward starboard electric motor 436 coupled to the forward starboard wing
25 412. In one embodiment, a horizontal stabilizer 438 may be coupled to the fuselage 406, and
    an elevator 440 may be rotatably coupled to horizontal stabilizer 438, with the fuselage 406
   coupled between the forward port wing 410 and forward starboard wing 412. A port aileron
   442 may be rotatably disposed on a trailing edge 444 of the aft port wing 402; and a starboard
    aileron 446 may be rotatably disposed on a trailing edge 448 of the aft starboard wing 404.
30 Aft and forward landing gear (450, 452) may be attached to the aft port wing 402 and aft
    starboard wing 404, respectively. A third landing gear 454 may be attached to the horizontal
    stabilizer 438, such as on opposite longitudinal sides of the horizontal stabilizer 438.
    [048]    For purposes of the previous discussion and following table descriptions, the
    described pitch, yaw, and roll movements resulting from "symmetric" and "differential"

   cyclic rotor control, collective rotor control and motor RPM, assume symmetric or near
   symmetric rotor placement about the center of mass of the air vehicle, assume identical or
   near identical electric motor outputs and assume symmetric or near symmetric parasitic drag
   of the aircraft's structure about its center of mass in horizontal and vertical flight modes. In
 5 real-world applications, bias or trim effector inputs may be provided to compensate for
   weight-balance deviation and for non-symmetrical parasitic drag of the aircraft's structure, to
   maintain the effectiveness of the following effector controls:
   [049]    Symmetric Collective effector control - Application of the same or similar collective
   control inputs as between two sets of rotors by respective swash plates (where a set may be a
10 single rotor) that results in the same or similar rotor force vectors as between such sets.
   [050]   Asymmetric Collective effector control - Application of dissimilar collective control
   inputs as between two sets of rotors by respective swash plates (where a set may be a single
   rotor) that results in dissimilar rotor force magnitude and but in the same or similar vector
   force direction as between such sets.
15 [051]   Asymmetric Cyclic effector control - Application of dissimilar cyclic control inputs as
   between two sets of rotors by respective swash plates (where a set may be a single rotor) that
   results in dissimilar rotor rotational moment magnitude and in the opposite rotational moment
   direction as between such sets.
   [052]    Symmetric Cyclic effector control - Application of the same or similar cyclic control
20 inputs as between two sets of rotors by respective swash plates (where a set may be a single
   rotor) that results in the same or similar rotor rotational moment magnitude and direction as
   between such sets. Symmetric Cyclic effector control may also be used to refer to all rotors
   having the same rotational moment magnitude and in the same or similar rotational moment
   direction.
25 [053]   Differential Motor RPM - Application of dissimilar rotational velocities as between
   two sets of motors (where a set may be a single motor), where such sets of motors are
   configured to translate such dissimilar rotational velocities into proportionally dissimilar
   rotor force magnitudes as between sets but in the same or similar vector force direction.
   [054]   FIG. 5 describes three flight control configuration embodiments that may each be
30 used to affect pitch, yaw, and roll control of the four-rotor fixed-wing aircraft first illustrated
   in FIGS. 4A, 4B, and 4C during the vehicle's vertical flight orientation, such as during
   takeoff and hover. Pitch to horizontal flight from vertical orientation may be accomplished by
   means of at least two effector embodiments. In flight control configuration Embodiment 1
   (line 1), pitch control of the fuselage 406 may be provided in response to providing
                                                    16

   differential motor RPM control between the aft port rotor 416 and/or the aft starboard rotors
   422 on the one hand, and the forward port rotor 428 and/or the forward starboard rotor 434
   on the other. In Embodiment 2 (line 1), pitch control of the fuselage may be provided in
   response to providing asymmetric collective control between the aft port rotor 416 and aft
 5 starboard rotor 422 on the one hand, and the forward port rotor 428 and forward starboard
   rotor 434 on the other.
   [055]   FIG. 5 also describes two different effector control embodiments that may be used to
   accomplish slow horizontal translation when the air vehicle 400 is in a vertical orientation
   mode. In Embodiment 1 (line 2), slow horizontal translation of the aft and forward port wings
10 (402, 410) and aft and forward starboard wings (404, 412) is induced by providing symmetric
   cyclic control of all rotors (416, 428, 422, and 434). In Embodiment 2 (line 2), slow
   horizontal translation in the vertical orientation mode may be provided by generating
   different collective between the aft port and starboard rotors (416, 422) on the one hand, and
   forward port and starboard rotors (428, 434) on the other hand. In an alternative embodiment,
15 the horizontal translation may be provided by generating different collective between the aft
   and forward port rotors (416, 428) on the one hand and aft and forward starboard rotors (422,
   434) on the other hand.
   [056]   A static non-zero roll station-keeping control of the fuselage may be accomplished
   during a hover/vertical orientation mode by means of at least two effector embodiments. In
20 Embodiment 1 (line 3), asymmetric collective control may be generated between aft and
   forward starboard rotors (422, 434) on the one hand and aft and forward port rotors (416,
   428) on the other, each approximately concurrently with symmetric cyclic control of the
   rotors (422, 434, 416, 428). In Embodiment 2 (line 3) differential motor RPM control may be
   provided between aft and forward starboard rotors (422, 412) on the one hand, and aft and
25 forward port rotors (416, 428) on the other, each approximately concurrently with non--zero
   symmetric cyclic control of all rotors (422, 434, 416, 428).
   [057]   A static non-zero pitch angle station-keeping control of the fuselage may also be
   accomplished during the hover/vertical orientation mode by means of at least two effector
   embodiments. In Embodiment 1 (line 4) illustrated in FIG. 5, asymmetric collective control
30 may be generated between the aft port and aft starboard rotors (416, 422) on the one hand and
   forward port and forward starboard rotors (416, 434) on the other, approximately
   concurrently with symmetric cyclic control of aft and forward port rotors (416, 428) on the
   one hand and aft and forward starboard rotors (422, 434) on the other. In Embodiment 2 (line
   4), the pitch angle station-keeping may be provided by generating differential motor RPM
                                                  17

   control between the aft port rotor 416 and aft starboard rotor 422 on the one hand, and the
   forward port rotor 428 and forward starboard rotor 434 on the other, approximately
   concurrently with symmetric cyclic control of the aft port rotor 416, forward port rotor 428,
   aft starboard rotor 422 and forward starboard rotor 434.
 5 [058]   A yaw moment may be induced about the fuselage during the hover/vertical
   orientation mode by means of at least two effector embodiments. In Embodiment 1 (line 5) of
   FIG. 5, the yaw moment may be induced in response to asymmetric cyclic control of the aft
   and forward port rotors (416, 428) on the one hand and aft and forward starboard rotors (422,
   434) on the other hand. In Embodiment 2 (line 5), the yaw moment may be induced in
10 response to differential motor RPM control of the aft port rotor 416 and forward starboard
   rotor 434 on the one hand, and forward port rotor 428 and aft starboard rotor 422 on the other.
   [059]   Vertical takeoff may be provided by means of at least two effector embodiments. In
   Embodiment 1 (line 6), the takeoff may be induced in response to symmetric motor RPM
   control of all rotors (422, 434, 416, 428). In Embodiment 2 (line 6) of FIG. 5, takeoff may be
15 induced in the fuselage in response to symmetric collective control of all rotors (422, 434,
   416, 428).
   [060]   Although FIG. 5 describes two aircraft configuration embodiments for affecting
   various aircraft attitudinal and translation controls, the effector controls in one aircraft
   configuration embodiment may be used in another embodiment.                 For example, in any
20 particular   aircraft  configuration    embodiment,     slow horizontal     translation    may be
   accomplished with either symmetric cyclic (non-zero) rotor control or asymmetric collective
   rotor control, as described in Fig. 5, line 2.
   [061]   FIG. 6 describes three flight control embodiments that may be used collectively to
   affect pitch, yaw, and roll control of the four-rotor fixed-wing aircraft first illustrated in FIGS.
25 4A, 4B, and 4C during the vehicle's horizontal flight orientation, such as when the aft and
   forward main wings (401, 408) are providing all or substantially all of the vertical lift during
   cruise or loiter. Pitch control of the fuselage to transition from horizontal flight orientation to
   vertical flight orientation, such as in preparation for landing or hover, may be induced about
   the fuselage during flight in its horizontal flight orientation by least three different aircraft
30 control configuration embodiments described in FIG. 6. In flight control Embodiment 1, pitch
   to vertical flight may be induced by providing asymmetric collective control between aft port
   and aft starboard rotors (416, 422) on the one hand, and forward port and forward starboard
   rotors (428, 434) on the other, and by providing approximately current and complementary
   elevator actuation. In flight control Embodiment 2 (line 1), pitch control of the aircraft is
                                                    18

   accomplished in response to providing asymmetric collective control between aft port and aft
   starboard rotors (416, 422) on the one hand, and forward port and forward starboard rotors
   (428, 434) on the other, without the use of elevator actuation. In flight control Embodiment 3
   (line 1), pitch control for the fuselage may be induced by providing differential motor RPM
 5 control between the aft port and aft starboard motors (418, 424) on the one hand and the
   forward port and forward starboard rotors (428, 434) on the other.
   [062]    Pitch control of the fuselage may be provided during flight while in the aircraft's
   horizontal orientation using least three different aircraft control configuration embodiments
   described in FIG. 6. In flight control Embodiment 1 (line 2), pitch may be induced by
10 providing elevator control without the use of asymmetric collective rotor control. In
   Embodiment 2 (line 2), pitch control may be induced by providing asymmetric collective
   control between aft port and aft starboard rotors (416, 422) on the one hand, and forward port
   and forward starboard rotors (428, 434) on the other, preferably without the use of elevator
   actuation. In Embodiment 3 (line 2), pitch control for the fuselage may be induced by
15 providing differential motor RPM control between the aft port and aft starboard motors (418,
   424) on the one hand and the forward port and forward starboard rotors (428, 434) on the
   other, preferably without the benefit of elevator actuation or asymmetric collective rotor
   control.
   [063]    A roll moment may be induced about the fuselage during flight in its horizontal flight
20 orientation by least three different aircraft control configuration embodiments described in
   FIG. 6. In flight control Embodiment 1 (line 3), a roll may be induced by providing actuation
   of the port and starboard ailerons (442, 446) rotatably coupled to the aft port wing 402 and aft
   starboard wing 404, respectively. In an alternative embodiment, port and starboard ailerons
   may also be provided on the forward port and starboard wings (410, 412) or on both forward
25 and main wings (401, 408). In Embodiment 2 (line 3), roll control may be induced by
   providing asymmetric cyclic rotor control of the aft and forward port rotors (416, 428) on the
   one hand, and the aft and forward starboard rotors (422, 434) on the other. In Embodiment 3
   (line 3), roll control may be provided by differential motor RPM control of the forward and
   aft port motors (430, 418) on the one hand, and forward and aft starboard motors (436, 424)
30 on the other hand.
   [064]    A yaw moment may be induced about the fuselage during flight in its horizontal flight
   orientation by least three different aircraft control configuration embodiments described in
   FIG. 6. In flight control Embodiments 1 and 2 (line 4), a yaw moment may be induced about
   the fuselage in response to asymmetric collective control between the aft and forward port
                                                  19

   rotors (416, 428) on the one hand, and the aft and forward starboard rotors (422, 434) on the
   other hand. In Embodiment 3 (line 4), the yaw moments may be induced in response to
   differential motor RPM control between the aft and forward port rotors (416, 428) on the one
   hand, and the aft and forward starboard rotors (422, 434) on the other.
 5 [065] A coordinated turn of the forward and aft main wings may also be accomplished
   during flight in its horizontal flight orientation by least three different aircraft control
   configuration embodiments described in FIG. 6. In flight control Embodiment 1 (line 5), a
   coordinated turn of the aircraft 400 may be accomplished by providing asymmetric aileron
   control between the port aileron 424 and the starboard aileron 446, concurrently with
10 asymmetric collective rotor control between aft and forward port rotors (416, 428) on the one
   hand and aft and forward starboard rotors (422, 434) on the other. In aircraft configuration
   Embodiment 2 (line 5), coordinated turn of the aircraft 400 may be accomplished by
   providing asymmetric cyclic control between the aft and forward port rotors (416, 428) on the
   one hand, and aft and forward starboard rotors (422, 434) on the other, approximately
15 concurrently with providing asymmetric collective control between aft and forward port
   rotors (416, 428) on the one hand and aft and forward starboard rotors (422, 434) on the other.
   [066]   FIGS. 7A, 7B, and 7C illustrate the affect of several of the effector control modes
   described in FIG. 5 for use in different weather conditions that may be encountered when
   attempting to land on a moving ship deck surface. More particularly, FIG. 7A illustrates
20 aircraft 400 in a vertical orientation while hovering over a ship deck 700 in calm wind
   conditions. The aft and forward port rotors (416, 428) and aft and forward starboard rotors
   (422, 434) may maintain the aircraft 400 in a static hover position and in level flight (i.e,
   pitch and roll angles at 0' with respect to a horizontal plane) such as by the use of symmetric
   collective control and/or motor RPM control of each rotor (416, 422, 428, 434) and
25 symmetric cyclic control of each rotor (416, 422, 428, 434) at 0' relative to a vertical axis. In
   Fig 7B, wind is illustrated off of the aircraft's 400 port wings (402, 410), necessitating active
   flight control such as that described in Embodiments 1 and 2 in line 2 of FIG. 5, which
   describe slow horizontal translation control of the fuselage while in the hover/vertical
   orientation. In an alternative embodiment, such as when the wind is coming horizontally from
30 the forward position/orientation, Embodiments 1 and 2 in line 2 of FIG. 5 may also be used to
   counteract wind forces impinging on the aircraft to maintain a static lateral position above the
   ship deck by adjusting symmetric cyclic to provide a thrust in the forward (x-axis) direction.
   In FIG. 7C, no wind is illustrated, but the ship deck is illustrated at an instantaneous pitch and
   roll angle from level suggesting the use of dynamic pitch and roll effector control of the
                                                    20

   aircraft 400 to accomplish a landing using, for example, a combination of control inputs
   selected from embodiments described in lines 3 and 4 of FIG. 5. For example, active pitch
   and roll angle management may be induced in the fuselage 446 as the aircraft 400 descends,
   to reduce undesirable lateral translation during descent, but allowing for proper orientation of
 5 the landing gear (450, 452 and 454) upon contact with the ship deck 700 even if the ship deck
   is rolling.
   [067]    FIGS. 8A, 8B, 8C illustate another embodiment of a four-rotor fixed-wing aircraft
   that has a turbine and internal combustion engine ("ICE") to charge batteries that provide
   power to electric motors that drive the rotors. The aircraft 800 may have the internal
10 combustion engine 805 and turbine 810 disposed within the fuselage 815. The internal
   combustion engine may be, for example, a diesel or jet-fueled engine, with one or more fuel
   tanks 820 available for the turbine and ice (810, 805) providing for diesel and jet fuel storage.
   The ICE and turbine may drive one or more generators that are electrically coupled to
   batteries 825. A payload 830 having, for example, sensors, and avionics 835 for remote
15 communication and control of the aircraft may also be disposed in the fuselage 815. Each
   rotor 840 may be driven by a respective electric motor 845 as guided by a respective swash
   plate 850, with each electric motor 845 obtaining power either directly from the batteries 825,
   the electrical power generated by the ICE 805 or turbine 810 or through some combination of
   batteries, ICE, or turbine (825, 805, 810). For example, during cruise or loiter, each electric
20 motor 845 may obtain power from the ICE 805. During vertical takeoff, each electric motor
   845 may obtain power from both the ICE 805 and turbine 810, or from the ICE, turbine and
   batteries, collectively (805, 810, 825).
   [068]    The aircraft 800 may be provided with four wings 860 in an X-wing configuration
   with the fuselage 815 in the center. The rotors may be arranged symmetrically about the
25 fuselage 815, one rotor on each wing 860, and preferably spaced equidistant from the
   fuselage 815 along a respective wing 860. In one embodiment, each rotor 840 is disposed at a
   respective wingtip 865 for enhanced attitudinal control of the fuselage 815. Although two
   blades 870 are provided for each rotor 840, each rotor may be a three or four-bladed rotor
   840. Four landing gear 875 may extend from engine nacelles or other supports 880 to enable
30 vertical take off and landing of the aircraft 800. The landing gear 875 may also extend from
   the fuselage 815, from two or more wings 860 or from some combination of the fuselage 815,
   wings 860 or supports 880.
   [069]    FIG. 9 illustrates one embodiment of a system for use with a fixed-wing aircraft
   having cyclic and collective control of multiple rotors that are configured for vertical takeoff
                                                  21

   and landing via a shipboard launch, and on-station loiter over land using satellite
   communications. Aircraft 900 may takeoff vertically from a vertical flight orientation from a
   ship deck 905 using thrust controlled by means of motor RPM control or collective rotor
   control, or both, with takeoff electric power provided to electric motors using a combination
 5 of the internal combustion engine generator, turbine generator, and previous-stored battery
   power for supplemental electric power. The aircraft 900 may pitch forward to establish a
   horizontal flight orientation 910 using a flight control configuration embodiment that may
   include i) differential motor RPM control, ii) or asymmetric collective control (see FIG. 5,
   line 1).
10 [070]    As a horizontal flight orientation is established, the aircraft may enter a fuel-efficient
   horizontal orientation cruise mode 915 (verses vertical orientation cruise), preferably utilizing
   electrical power from one of only the internal combustion engine generator (see FIGS. 8A,
   8B, 8C) to drive the rotors, with primary lift being provided by the aircraft's wings for flight
   to a loiter station 910. In an alternative embodiment, either the turbine generator or battery or
15 both may be used for cruise power should the internal combustion engine generator be
   insufficient or unavailable or if additional electrical power is desired. In aircraft control
   embodiments, pitch control about the fuselage may be accomplished using i) elevator
   actuation, ii) asymmetric collective control, or iii) differential motor RPM control as
   described in line 2 of FIG. 6. Roll control about the fuselage may be accomplished using a)
20 ailerons, b) asymmetric cyclic rotor control, or c) differential motor RPM control as
   described in line 3 of FIG. 6. Yaw control about the fuselage may be accomplished using
   asymmetric collective control or differential motor RPM control as described in line 4 of FIG.
   6. Coordinated turns may be facilitated during horizontal orientation cruise for using x)
   ailerons and asymmetric collective rotor control, y) asymmetric cyclic rotor control and
25 asymmetric collective rotor control, or z) differential motor RPM control.
   [071]    Communication with a command and control station, such as a ship 920, may be
   facilitated via a satellite 925.
   [072]    Upon the conclusion of the on-station loiter 910, the aircraft may return 930 to a
   landing destination such as, for example, the ship deck 905. Upon reaching the landing
30 destination, the aircraft may pitch to the horizontal flight orientation 935 using, for example,
   differential motor RPM control or asymmetric collective control to make the flight
   orientation change, as effector embodiments are described in FIG 5, line 1. Slow horizontal
   translation of the aircraft may be used for final landing position control using symmetric
   cyclic (non--zero) rotor control or asymmetric collective rotor control as described in FIG. 5,
                                                    22

    ine 2. i the landing destination is not level, or i the snip deck is leaving, tne aircraft may
   match the pitch and roll angle of the ship deck 905 as the aircraft descends using the effector
   control embodiments described in FIG. 5, lines 3 and 4.
   [073]    In an alternative embodiment, the aircraft 900 is a two-rotor aircraft as illustrated in
 5 FIGS. 1 and 2A, 2B, 2C and with effectors as configured in FIGS. 3A and 3B. As in FIG. 9,
   the fixed-wing aircraft would be may takeoff vertically from a vertical flight orientation from
   a ship deck 905 using thrust controlled by means of motor RPM control or collective rotor
   control, or both. The aircraft may pitch forward to establish a horizontal flight orientation 910
   using a flight control configuration embodiment that may include i) symmetric cyclic control,
10 ii) or symmetric cyclic control with symmetric elevons actuation (see FIG. 3B, line 1). As a
   horizontal flight orientation is established, the aircraft may enter a fuel-efficient horizontal
   orientation cruise mode 915 (verses vertical orientation cruise), with vertical lift created
   primarily from its wings (115, 120)(see FIG. 1) for flight to a loiter station 910. In aircraft
   control embodiments, pitch control about the fuselage may be accomplished using i)
15 symmetric cyclic control or ii) symmetric rotor control and symmetric elevons actuation. Roll
   control about the fuselage may be accomplished using a) asymmetric cyclic rotor control, or
   b) asymmetric cyclic control. Yaw control about the fuselage may be accomplished using x)
   asymmetric cyclic rotor control or y) asymmetric cyclic rotor control and asymmetric elevon
   actuation. A coordinated turn may be facilitated using I) asymmetric cyclic rotor control with
20 asymmetric collective rotor control, II) asymmetric elevon actuation with asymmetric
   collective rotor control, or III) asymmetric cyclic rotor control with asymmetric collective
   and asymmetric elevons actuation, or IV) asymmetric cyclic rotor control with asymmetric
   elevons actuation and differential RPM control.
   [074]    Upon the conclusion of the on-station loiter 910 by the 2-rotor aircraft, it may return
25 930 to a landing destination such as, for example, the ship deck 905. Upon reaching the
   landing destination, the aircraft may pitch to the horizontal flight orientation using, for
   example, either symmetric cyclic rotor control or symmetric cyclic rotor control with
   symmetric elevons actuation.
   [075]    FIG. 10 is a block diagram illustrating one embodiment of a hybrid power system
30 having power plant and energy stores for use with a four-rotor fixed-wing aircraft having four
   electric motors. The aircraft 1000 is illustrated having four electric motors 1005 that are in
   electrical communication with the hybrid power system 1010 that may consist of a hover
   battery 1015, an internal combustion engine generator 1020 and a turbine electric generator
    1025. Diesel and jet fuel tanks (1035, 1040) may be in liquid communication with the
                                                   23

  internal combustion engine generator and turbine electric generator, respectively (1020,
  1025).   A payload 1045, such as image or thermal sensors, transceivers or atmospheric
  sensors, may be in electrical communication with the hybrid power system 1005.
  [076]   While various embodiments of the application have been described, it will be
5 apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and
  implementations are possible that are within the scope of this invention.
