                                FIELD OF THE INVENTION

improving yield and/or for protection from pests.
                             DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART
        [004]      Fungal endophytes are fungi that internally colonize plant tissues without
causing evident damage or disease.          Particular fungal endophytes, such as mycorrhiza,
survive within various host plant tissues, often colonizing the intercellular spaces of host
leaves, stems, flowers or roots.     The symbiotic endophyte-host relationships can provide
several fitness benefits to the host plant, such as enhancement of nutrition, and/or increased
drought tolerance.     Root-colonizing mycorrhizae survive on photosynthetic carbohydrates
from the plant, and in return, aid in the solubilization and uptake of water and minerals to the
host, which can lead to the promotion of seed germination and plant growth. Additionally,
the association of a fungal endophyte with a host plant can provide tolerance to a variety of
biotic and abiotic stresses. Host growth, fitness promotion and protection are thought to be
achieved through multiple beneficial properties of the endophyte-host association.          For
instance, the endophytic organisms may produce growth-regulating substances to induce
biomass production and alkaloids or other metabolites. Additionally, fungal endophytes may
                                                   1

                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
        [062]      Endophytic fungi are ubiquitous in nature, infecting virtually all plants in
both natural and agronomic ecosystems. Plants commonly harbor a diversity of fungi living
within their tissues as asymptomatic endophytes that can provide protection from a range of
biotic and abiotic stressors. The present disclosure describes certain fungal endophytes that
can be pathogens, parasites or antagonists to plant pathogens, insects, and nematode pests,
thereby providing health and performance benefits to crop plants. The symbiotic endophyte
host relationships can provide several general health and fitness benefits to the host plant,
such as enhancement of nutrition, increased drought tolerance and/or chemical defense from
potential herbivores and often enhanced biomass production. Root-colonizing mycorrhizae
survive on photosynthetic carbohydrates from the plant, and in return, aid in the
solubilization and uptake of water and minerals to the host, which can lead to the promotion
of seed germination and plant growth. Additionally, the association of a fungal endophyte
with a host plant often provides protection from pathogens or tolerance to a variety of biotic
and abiotic stresses, such as insect infestation, grazing, water or nutrient deficiency, heat
stress, salt or aluminum toxicity, and freezing temperatures.        Host growth and fitness
promotion and protection are thought to be achieved through multiple beneficial properties of
the endophyte-host association.
        [063]      These fungal endophytes provided in Table 1 were originally collected as
fungal endophytes of cotton. These endophytic fungi can be inoculated to live within cotton
using either seed, soil or foliar applications and exhibited surprisingly beneficial effects by
                                               15

 WO 2015/069938                                                               PCT/US2014/064411
providing protection from pest infestation. Pests can be nematode and/or insect pests. In
addition, these endophytic fungi have an unexpected beneficial effect on cotton yield.
         [064]      Described is the application of beneficial fungi to establish endophytically
within crop plants to improve plant performance and yield while conferring protection against
insect and nematode pests. In this regard, the present invention overcomes the limitations of
the prior art such as the susceptibility of the fungi to degradation by UV light, desiccation or
heat after exposure to the environment following application as an inundative soil or foliar
biopesticide. Inoculation and endophytic establishment of the fungi within the plant protects
the fungi from UV light, desiccation, and unfavorable temperatures, while harboring the
fungi in the very plant tissues they are intended to protect.          Introducing fungi to live
endophytically within plants requires no genetic modification of the plant or microorganisms,
and the fungi themselves can be a source for natural products. In various embodiments, the
fungal inoculant can be formulated and applied, for example, as treatment of seeds, in furrow
applications, before or during planting, or as foliar application after plant germination, and
after inoculation, the fungal endophytes provide season-long protective effects and higher
crop yields (approximately 25% higher).         In certain embodiments, the increase of yield is
about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 45%, 50%, or greater than 50% relative to a crop to
which no endophyte composition has been applied. In further embodiments, the increase of
yield is the result of reduction of loss that comprises reduction of loss due to insect infestation
or drought and the loss is less than 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, or 5% relative to a crop
to which no endophyte composition has been applied. In certain embodiments, the crop is
cotton and the reduction of loss comprises reduced boll damage.
         [065]      Thus, in one aspect, the invention provides a combination (also termed a
"symbiotum") of a host plant and an endophyte that allows for improved agronomic
properties of host plants.      The combination may be achieved by artificial inoculation,
application, or other infection of a host plant or seeds thereof, such as a cotton plant or seed
thereof, or host plant tissues, with a fungal endophyte strain of the present invention. Thus, a
combination achieved by such an inoculation is termed a "synthetic" combination, synthetic
composition, synthetic seed coating, synthetic pest-resistant seed composition.        The fungal
endophyte may be present in intercellular spaces within plant tissue, such as the root. Its
presence may also occur or may also be maintained within a plant or plant population by
means of grafting or other inoculation methods such as treating seeds, plants or parts thereof
with endophyte mycelia, or endophyte spores. In certain embodiments, the plant, part of the
                                                  16

 WO 2015/069938                                                                PCT/US2014/064411
plant, roots, seed, or leaves are sterilized to remove microorganisms before applying the
endophyte.    In particular embodiments, seeds are sterilized to remove native endophytes
before adding the endophyte compositions herein described. In certain aspects, the ability of
the seed to germinate is not affected by the sterilization.
        [066]      The invention also provides methods for detecting the presence of the
fungal endophyte of the present invention within a host plant. This may be accomplished, for
instance, by isolation of total DNA from tissues of a potential plant-endophyte combination,
followed by PCR, or alternatively, Southern blotting, western blotting, or other methods
known in the art, to detect the presence of specific nucleic or amino acid sequences
associated with the presence of a fungal endophyte strain of the present invention.
Alternatively, biochemical methods such as ELISA, HPLC, TLC, or fungal metabolite assays
may be utilized to determine the presence of an endophyte strain of the present invention in a
given sample of crop tissue.          Additionally, methods for identification may include
microscopic analysis, such as root staining, or culturing methods, such as grow out tests or
other methods known in the art (Deshmukh et al. 2006). In particular embodiments, the roots
of a potential grass plant-endophyte combination may be stained with fungal specific stains,
such as WGA-Alexa 488, and microscopically assayed to determine fungal root associates.
        [067]      In certain embodiments, the agronomic qualities may be selected from the
group consisting of: increased biomass, increased tillering, increased root mass, increased
flowering, increased seed yield, and enhanced resistance to biotic and/or abiotic stresses, each
of these qualities being rated in comparison to otherwise identical plants grown under the
same conditions, and differing only with respect to the presence or absence of a fungal
endophyte. The synthetic combinations and methods of the present invention may be applied
to respond to actual or anticipated stresses. Such stresses may include, for instance, drought
(water deficit), cold, heat stress, nutrient deficiency, salt toxicity, aluminum toxicity, grazing
by herbivores, insect infestation, nematode infection, and fungal, bacteria or viral infection,
among others.
        [068]      The present disclosure provides, in one embodiment, fungal endophytes
selected from those in Table 1 that negatively affect the reproduction of insect herbivores
feeding on leaves above ground (cotton aphids, Aphis gossypii) and plant parasitic nematodes
attacking roots below ground (root knot nematodes, Meloidogyne incognita). In addition,
improved plant performance and yields in colonized versus uncolonized control plants may
be observed in field trials employing seed treatment with such endophytes.          Plant growth

enhancement and increased resistance to root knot nematodes was demonstrated in cotton, for
example, employing Chaetomium globosum as an endophyte in greenhouse trials. In addition
and as a further non-limiting illustrative example, using Beauveria bassiana as an endophyte
in cotton, reductions in insect (cotton aphid) reproduction was demonstrated in both
greenhouse and field trials.       The endophytic presence of Paecilomyces lilacinus and
Beauveria bassiana also had negative effects on the host selection behavior of key sucking
bug pests (Lygus hesperus and Nezara viridula) that attack developing flowers and fruits in
cotton. Furthermore, in field trials using Beauveria bassiana as an endophyte in cotton
positive effects on plant performance and higher yields in endophyte colonized versus
uncolonized control plants was demonstrated.
         [069]     Metabolomic differences between the plants can be detected using methods
known in the art. For example, a biological sample (whole tissue, exudate, phloem sap, xylem
sap, root exudate, etc.) from the endophyte-associated and reference agricultural plants can be
analyzed essentially as described in Fiehn et al., (2000) Nature Biotechnol., 18, 1157-1161,
or Roessner et al., (2001) Plant Cell, 13, 11-29. Such metabolomic methods can be used to
detect differences in levels in hormones, nutrients, secondary metabolites, root exudates,
phloem sap content, xylem sap content, heavy metal content, and the like.
         [070]     In another embodiment, the present invention contemplates methods of
coating the seed of a plant with a plurality of endophytes, as well as seed compositions
comprising a plurality of endophytes on and/or in the seed. The methods according to this
embodiment can be performed in a manner similar to those described herein for single
endophyte coating. In one example, multiple endophytes can be prepared in a single
preparation that is coated onto the seed. The endophytes can be from a common origin (i.e., a
same plant). Alternatively, the endophytes can be from different plants.
         [071]     Where multiple endophytes are coated onto the seed, any or all of the
endophytes may be capable of conferring a beneficial trait onto the host plant. In some cases,
all of the endophytes are capable of conferring a beneficial trait onto the host plant. The trait
conferred by each of the endophytes may be the same (e.g., both improve the host plant's
tolerance to a particular biotic stress), or may be distinct (e.g., one improves the host plant's
tolerance to drought, while another improves phosphate utilization). In other cases the
conferred trait may be the result of interactions between the endophytes.

         Definitions
         [072]      In the description and tables herein, a number of terms are used. In order to
provide a clear and consistent understanding of the specification and claims, the following
definitions are provided. Unless otherwise noted, terms are to be understood according to
conventional usage by those of ordinary skill in the relevant art.
         [073]      When a term is provided in the singular, the inventors also contemplate
aspects of the invention described by the plural of that term. The singular form "a," "an," and
"the" include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. For example, the
term "a cell" includes one or more cells, including mixtures thereof.
         [074]      The term "comprising" is intended to mean that the compositions and
methods include the recited elements, but not excluding others. "Consisting essentially of"
when used to define compositions and methods, shall mean excluding other elements of any
essential significance to the combination. Thus, a composition consisting essentially of the
elements as defined herein would not exclude trace contaminants from the isolation and
purification method and agriculturally acceptable carriers. "Consisting of" shall mean
excluding more than trace elements of other ingredients and substantial method steps for
applying the compositions of this invention.          Embodiments defined by each of these
transition terms are within the scope of this invention.
         [075]      Biological control: the term "biological control" and its abbreviated form
"biocontrol," as used herein, is defined as control of a pest, pathogen, or insect or any other
undesirable organism by the use of at least one endophyte.
         [076]      A "composition" is intended to mean a combination of active agent and at
least another compound, carrier or composition, inert (for example, a detectable agent or label
or liquid carrier) or active, such as a pesticide.
         [077]      As used herein, an "agricultural seed" is a seed used to grow plants in
agriculture (an "agricultural plant"). The seed may be of a monocot or dicot plant, and is
planted for the production of an agricultural product, for example grain, food, fiber, etc. As
used herein, an agricultural seed is a seed that is prepared for planting, for example, in farms
for growing. Agricultural seeds are distinguished from commodity seeds in that the former is
not used to generate products, for example commodity plant products.
         [078]      As used herein, a "commodity plant product" refers to any composition or
product that is comprised of material derived from a plant, seed, plant cell, or plant part of the
present invention. Commodity plant products may be sold to consumers and can be viable or
                                                   19

nonviable. Nonviable commodity products include but are not limited to nonviable seeds and
grains; processed seeds, seed parts, and plant parts; dehydrated plant tissue, frozen plant
tissue, and processed plant tissue; seeds and plant parts processed for animal feed for
terrestrial and/or aquatic animal consumption, oil, meal, flour, flakes, bran, fiber, and any
other food for human or animal consumption; and biomasses and fuel products. Any such
commodity plant product that is derived from the plants of the present invention may contain
at least a detectable amount of the specific and unique DNA corresponding to the endophytes
described herein. Any standard method of detection for polynucleotide molecules may be
used, including methods of detection disclosed herein.
         [079]     As used herein, the phrase "agronomically elite plants" refers to a genotype
or cultivar with a phenotype adapted for commercial cultivation.         Traits comprised by an
agronomically elite plant may include biomass, carbohydrate, and/or seed yield; biotic or
abiotic stress resistance, including drought resistance, insect resistance, fungus resistance,
virus resistance, bacteria resistance, cold tolerance, and salt tolerance; improved standability,
enhanced nutrient use efficiency, and reduced lignin content.
         [080]     In certain embodiments, cotton agronomically elite plants include, for
example, known cotton varieties AM 1550 B2RF, NG 1511 B2RF, NG 1511 B2RF, FM
1845LLB2, FM 1944GLB2, FM 1740B2F, PHY 499 WRF, PHY 375 WRF, PHY 367 WRF,

B2RF, and/or DP 1137 B2RF.
         [081]     As used herein, the phrase "culture filtrate" refers to broth or media
obtained from cultures inoculated with a strain of fungi and allowed to grow. The media is
typically filtered to remove any suspended cells, leaving the nutrients, hormones, or other
chemicals.
         [082]     As used herein, the term "endophyte" refers to an organism capable of
living within a plant or plant tissue. An endophyte may comprise a fungal organism that may
confer an increase in yield, biomass, resistance, or fitness in its host plant.          Fungal
endophytes may occupy the intracellular or extracellular spaces of plant tissue, including the
leaves, stems, flowers, or roots.
         [083]     The phrase "pest resistance" refers to inhibiting or reducing attack from
pests. Pest resistance provides at least some increase in pest resistance over that which is
already possessed by the plant.

         [084]      As used herein, the term "genotypes" refers to the genetic constitution of a
cell or organism.
         [085]      As used herein, the term "phenotype" refers to the detectable characteristics
of a cell or organism, which characteristics are either the direct or indirect manifestation of
gene expression.
         [086]      As used herein, the phrase "host plant" refers to any plant that an
endophytic fungi colonizes.      In certain embodiments, the host plant comprises progeny of
colonized plant.
         [087]      As used herein, the phrase "increased yield" refers to an increase in biomass
or seed weight, seed or fruit size, seed number per plant, seed number per unit area, bushels
per acre, tons per acre, kilo per hectare, carbohydrate yield, or cotton yield. Such increased
yield is relative to a plant or crop that has not been inoculated with the endophyte. In certain
embodiments, the increase yield is relative to other commonly used pest treatments or other
methods of addressing the biotic or abiotic stress.
         [088]      As used herein, the phrase "biomass" means the total mass or weight (fresh
or dry), at a given time, of a plant tissue, plant tissues, an entire plant, or population of plants,
usually given as weight per unit area. The term may also refer to all the plants or species in
the community (community biomass).
         [089]      As used herein, "sticker" refers to compounds to enhance binding of spores
to the seed surface. Non-limiting examples of such compounds are alginic acid, carrageenan,
dextrin, dextran, pelgel, polyethelene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose,
polyvinyl alcohol, or gelatin.
         [090]      As used herein, an "agriculturally acceptable" excipient or carrier is one
that is suitable for use in agriculture without undue adverse side effects to the plants, the
environment, or to humans or animals who consume the resulting agricultural products
derived therefrom commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
         [091]      As used herein, the term "synthetic" or the phrase "synthetic combination"
refers to an artificial combination that includes mycelia and/or spores of a endophyte that is
or leads to an endophytic fungal-host relationship (also termed a "symbiotum") of a host
plant and an endophyte.        The synthetic combination may be achieved, for example, by
artificial inoculation, application, or other infection of a host plant, host plant seeds, or host
plant tissues with the endophyte. In addition, the combination of host plant and an endophyte
may be achieved by inoculating the soil or growth media of the plant.

 WO 2015/069938                                                             PCT/US2014/064411
         [092]     The present invention contemplates, in one embodiment, the use of an
"isolated" microbe. As used herein, an isolated microbe is a microbe that is isolated from its
native environment, and carries with it an inference that the isolation was carried out by the
hand of man. An isolated microbe is one that has been separated from at least some of the
components with which it was previously associated (whether in nature or in an experimental
setting).
         [093]     As used herein, a microbe is considered to be "native" to a plant or a
portion of the plant, and is said to be "natively" present in the plant or a portion of plant, if
that plant or portion of the plant contains the microbe, for example, in the absence of any
contacting with the microbe preparation.
         [094]     Some of the methods described herein allow the colonization of plant seeds
by microbes. As used herein, a microbe is said to "colonize" a plant or seed when it can exist
in a symbiotic or non-detrimental relationship with the plant in the plant environment, for
example on and/or inside a plant, including the seed.
         [095]     A "population" of plants, as used herein, refers to a plurality of plants that
were either grown from the seeds coated with the endophytes as described herein, or are
progeny of a plant or group of plants that were subjected to the inoculation methods. The
plants within a population will typically be of the same species, and will also typically share a
common genetic derivation
                                               EXAMPLES
               Example 1: Creating Spore Suspensions and Treatment of Seeds
         [096]     Cultivation of plants and endophytic fungi strains: The cotton seed variety
used in particular embodiments was variety LA122 (available from All-Tex Seed, Inc.,
Levelland, TX 79336).      Paecilomyces lilacinus and Chaetomium globosum were obtained
from cotton plants as described (Ek-Ramos et al. 2013, PLoS ONE 8(6): e66049.
doi:10.1371/joumal.pone.0066049).        Persons of ordinary skill in the art can obtain
endophytes suitable for performing the various embodiments of the present invention by
performing the procedures described therein. In short, plant samples were rinsed in tap water
and surface sterilized by immersion in 70% ethanol for 5 min, 10% bleach solution for 3 min,
and rinsed twice with autoclaved distilled water. Samples were blotted dry using autoclaved
paper towels.     Five individual surface sterilized leaves, squares and bolls (N = 15 total
samples) were randomly selected and imprinted onto fresh potato dextrose agar (PDA) and
                                               22

V8 media as a way to monitor surface sterilization efficiency.        For endophyte isolation,
leaves were cut in small fragments of approximately 1 cm 2 . Squares and bolls were cut in six
pieces. Any fiber present was removed and cut into six smaller pieces. Leaf fragments were
placed upside down on PDA and V8 medium plates in triplicate. Each plate contained 3 leaf
fragments for a total of 9 fragments assayed per plant. For squares collected early in the
season, 3 slices per square were plated on PDA and V8 media as with the leaf fragments.
Because of similarity in size and location within a plant, when collected later in the season,
squares and bolls from a given plant were plated together on petri dishes containing two
square slices, two boll slices and two pieces of fiber. Antibiotics Penicillin G (100 Units/mL)
and Streptomycin (100 pg/mL) (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) were added to the media to
suppress bacterial growth. All plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature for, in
average, two weeks until growth of fungal endophyte hyphae from plant tissues was detected.
         [097]     An inclusive     combination    of morphological     and    molecular  fungal
endophyte identification was employed for identification. Once fungal hyphae were detected
growing from the plant material, samples were taken to obtain pure fungal isolates.          For
identification by PCR, genomic DNA was extracted from mycelium of each isolated fungal
strain, following a chloroform:isoamyl alcohol 24:1 protocol and fungal specific primers
were used to amplify the ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) region of nuclear ribosomal
DNA. This region is the primary barcoding marker for fungi and includes the ITS 1 and ITS2
regions, separated by the 5.8S ribosomal gene. In order to avoid introducing biases during
PCR (taxonomy bias and introduction of mismatches), it has been suggested to amplify the
ITS1 region only, therefore the primers ITS1 (5' TCC GTA GGT GAA CCT GCG G 3')
(SEQ ID NO:5) and ITS2 (5' GCT GCG TTC TTC ATC GAT GC 3') (SEQ ID NO:6) were
used to amplify and sequence the -240 bp ITS1 region of each one of the isolated fungal
strains. The resulting sequences were aligned as query sequences with the publicly available
databases GenBank nucleotide, UNITE and PlutoF. The last two are specifically compiled
and used for fungi identification. Table 1 provides a list of endophytes identified and useful
in the present invention. All of these endophytes belong to phylum Ascomycota, subphylum
Pezizomycotina, except for Phanerochaetecrassa, which belongs to phylum Basidiomycota,
subphylum Agaricomycotina, and Pseudozyma sp, which belongs to phylum Basidiomycota,
subphylum Ustilaginomycotina.       Table 1 shows the species/genus, family, order, subclass,
class, and the SEQ ID NO corresponding to the -240 bp ITS1 region for each one of the
isolated fungal strains, except for Beauveria bassiana,Aspergillus parasiticus,Lecanicillium

        [0100]     Beauveria bassiana was cultured from a commercially obtained strain
(available from Botanigard). Beauveria bassiana, Paecilomyces lilacinus, and Chaetomium
globosum were cultured on potato dextrose agar media (PDA). Stock spore concentration
solutions of each fungi were made by adding 10ml of sterile water to the fungi plates and
scraping them free of the agar with a sterile scalpel.       The resulting mycelia and spores
obtained were then filtered into a sterile beaker utilizing a cheese cloth to filter out the
mycelia, thereby creating stock solutions.       A haemocytometer was used to measure and
calculate spore concentrations of the stock solutions.        The desired concentrations were
created by dilution, and seeds were placed into spore suspensions with the desired spore
concentrations. In various embodiments, the final treatment concentrations can be about 102,
101, 104, 101, 101, 107, 108, or 109 spores/ml which can be reached by serial dilutions in sterile
water or in an appropriate solution or buffer.

        [0101]     For seed inoculation, the seeds were surface sterilized prior to soaking them
in spore suspensions with the desired concentration by immersion the seeds in 70% ethanol
for 3 minutes with constant shaking followed by incubation in 2% NaOCl for 3 minutes;
followed by three washes in sterile water. The third sterile water wash was plated onto potato
dextrose agar media (PDA) to confirm that surface sterilization was effective. Seeds were
then soaked for 24 hours in beakers containing spore suspensions with two different
concentrations of fungi.     Control group seeds were treated with sterile water only.     Spore
                                                                      6                         9
concentrations for Beauveria bassiana were zero (control), 1x10         (treatment 1) and 1x10
(treatment 2) and for Paecilomyces lilacinus or Chaetomium globosum were zero (control),
1x10 6 (treatment 1) and 1x10    7
                                   (treatment 2). These beakers were incubated for 24 hours at
32'C in a culture chamber until next day for planting (24hr).
        [0102]     Soaked seeds were planted in L22 mix soil (Borlaug Institute, Texas
A&M).      All plants were grown in a laboratory greenhouse at -28'C with a natural light
photoperiod.    There was no fertilization of the plants, and watering was done consistently
across all treatments as needed.
        [0103]     Direct seed inoculation: In particular embodiments, individual seeds and the
surrounding soil can be directly inoculated with the spore solution (102-103, 103-104, 104-101,
106-107, or 107-108 spores/ml) at planting before covering the seed with soil.
        [0104]     In various embodiments, any seed or plant treatments that are suitable for
application of biological agents to seeds or plants and known to persons having ordinary skill
in the art can be employed.
       Example 2: Application of Endophyte Spores as a Dry Powder Composition.
        [0105]     In addition to application of a spore solution for seed treatment, the
endophytes or endophyte spores can also be applied as dry powder or using a sicker such as
methyl cellulose for seed treatment. In certain embodiments, the concentration may be at
least 105,106,107,108, 10 9, or higher colony forming units or spores/g dry weight.
        [0106]     In certain embodiments, endophytes can be grown in fungi cultivation
media in a fermenter. Endophytic mycelial fragments or spores can be collected, dried and
ground.     A sticker such as caboxymethyl cellulose may also be added to the ground
endophytic material.
        [0107]     In certain embodiments the weight ratio between endophytic material and
sticker may be between 1:10-50, 1:50-100, 1:100-500, or 1:500-1000 to obtain the seed
coating or seed inoculation material. This seed inoculation material can be applied to seeds.

In various embodiments, the weight ratio between seed inoculation material and seed may be
1:10-50, 1:50-100, 1:100-500, 1:500-1000, or 1:1000-5000.
                    Example 3: Soil (in Furrow) Endophyte Treatments
        [0108]     Soil drench (in furrow) application may be performed by applying an
endophyte composition to the surface of the soil and/or seed during planting. In particular
embodiments, the endophyte composition may comprise an endophyte suspension or an
endophyte dry powder formulation.      In various embodiments the endophyte may comprise
mycelia and/or spores. In particular embodiments, the soil drench application may comprise
applying the endophyte composition to the surface of the soil directly above each seed. In
certain embodiments, the endophyte composition may comprise 0.01-0.1, 0.1-1, or 1-10 ml
endophyte suspension, which may be a endophyte spore suspension.
        [0109]    Soil inoculation: In certain embodiments, seeds can be planted into
inoculated soil.   The inoculum can be obtained by multiplying the endophyte on fungal
growth media. The fungal growth media can be potato dextrose agar media (PDA). In other
embodiments the fungal growth media can be as wheat grain. In a non-limiting example, 100
g of wheat grain can be washed and soaked overnight in sterile water. Excess water can be
drained, seeds dried on paper towel, packed in a 500 ml conical flask and autoclaved at 15 psi
for 1 h.   One milliliter of the endophytic fungal spore suspension (107 spores/ml) can be
inoculated to the flask, and the cultures can be incubated at 25 C for 2 weeks.       To avoid
clumping, the flasks can be shaken vigorously to separate the grain and break the mycelial
mat.    Approximately    5g of inoculum can be placed in soil at planting.           In certain
embodiments, the inoculum can be placed in the soil at the same time or within 1 month of
planting the seeds. In certain embodiments, the seeds may comprise sterilized seeds.
                          Example 4: Foliar Endophyte Treatments
        [0110]    Plants were inoculated via foliar application at the third true leaf stage by
spraying the surface of fully expanded leaves to run-off with a spore suspension (108
spores/ml) using a hand-held plastic sprayer (1 L). In certain embodiments, endophyte spore
suspensions were made in water. In certain embodiments, the water was supplemented with a
detergent. In a particular non-limiting example, the spore suspension contained 0.02% Triton
X 100 as a detergent.

        [0111]     Foliar endophyte treatment may be performed using any suitable method
known to a person having ordinary skill in the art. In particular, foliar endophyte treatment
may be performed using a sprayer by directly spraying leaves with an endophyte suspension,
which may be a endophyte spore suspension.
        [0112]     Fig. 9 demonstrates that foliar application of cotton in the field with spores
of endophytic entomopathogenic fungi improved plant performance.                 Cotton (variety
FM174OB2F) seeds were treated with a variety of typical fungicide (Metalaxyl, Triadimenol,
Trifloxystrobin,   2-(Thiocyanome-thylthio)    benzothioazole)    and insecticide    (Thiodicarb,
Imidacloprid, Chloropyrifos), and seed treatments were planted and grown under field
conditions.   The plants were sprayed at the 5th true leaf stage with aqueous solutions of
Beauveria bassianaand Paecilomycesfumosoroseus. Sucrose was included (1%wt/vol) as an
additional nutritional resource for the fungi.        Significantly higher first position boll
(developing fruit) retention was observed in plants sprayed with Beauveria bassiana without
sucrose and P. fumosoroseus plus sucrose.
                 Example 5: Confirmation of Plant Colonization by Endophytic Fungi
        [0113]     Plants were individually placed in plastic bags, which were labelled with
plant number, treatment, and final aphid number, and stored in 4'C until the next day for
endophyte confirmation. Half of each plant was utilized for plating on PDA agar and the
other half was freeze-dried for to conduct diagnostic PCR assays for endophyte confirmation.
The surface sterilization protocol and plating of third sterile water wash on PDA to test for
surface contamination was conducted as described above. For diagnostic PCR assays, plant
tissue was freeze-dried and DNA was extracted utilizing the CTAB protocol (Doyle & Doyle,
1987, Phytochemistry Bulletin 19:11-15). The oligonucleotide primer sequences synthesized
were based upon a NCBI BLAST search corresponding to the laboratory culture sequence
results isolated (Ek-Ramos et al., 2013). Sense and antisense oligonucleotide sequences for
Beauveria bassiana were: 5'-CGGCGGACTCGCCCCAGCCCG-3' (SEQ ID NO:1) and 5'
CCGCGTCGGGGTTCCGGTGCG-3' (SEQ ID NO:2) respectively.                       The oligonucleotides
used to amplify Paecelomyces lilacinus were: 5' CTCAGTTGCCTCGGCGGGAA 3' (SEQ
ID NO:3) and 5' GTGCAACTCAGAGAAGAAATTCCG 3' (SEQ ID NO:4).
        [0114]     The PCR protocol consisted of a denaturation step at 95'C for 5 min,
followed by alignment of oligonucleotides at 56'C for 2 min and an extension step of 7 min at
72'C with a total of 35 cycles.     The PCR products were visualized in a 2% agarose gel
containing 1% ethidium bromide. Electrophoresis was performed at 70 volts for 30 min.

                    Example 6: Endophytic Fungi can be manipulated in the field
        [0115]      A field trial using isolates of Paecilomyces lilacinus and Beauveria
bassiana was conducted during the summer. A randomized block design with five replicate
plots that were planted with seeds that were inoculated by soaking for 9 hr in three different
aqueous spore concentrations (0, 10 6 , or 1088 spores/ml) of the candidate endophyte (such as
Paecilomyces lilacinus or Beauveria bassiana). Each plot consisted of four 15.24 m (40 ft)
rows, each separated by 101.6 cm (40 in).
        [0116]      Colonization efficiency: At the first true leaf stage, four plants from each
plot for a total of 20 plants per treatment were randomly sampled and tested for colonization
by each of the candidate endophytes.           Colonization frequencies were determined by
incubating surface sterilized root, stem and leaf fragments on PDA media and observing for
fungal growth. Colonization frequencies are reported as the number of plants per treatment
group with at least one positively colonized plant fragment.
        [0117]      The high endophytic colonization frequency of seedlings by Paecilomyces
lilacinus or Beauveria bassianademonstrates that the presence of specific endophytes can be
manipulated under field planting conditions (Fig. 1).
                         Example 7: Cotton Aphid Reproduction Test
        [0118]      A colony of A. gossypii was reared on cotton in cages in a greenhouse kept
at approximately 28'C with natural light photoperiod. Second instar nymphs were placed
directly onto endophyte-treated cotton plants and control plants. Ten plants were utilized per
treatment group and ten aphids were placed per plant. After plants were inoculated with the
aphids, the plants were placed in individual plastic 45 x 20 cm cups and sealed with no-see
um mesh (Eastex products, NJ) to avoid aphid movement from plant to plant.                In one
embodiment, the plants used were 13 days old, approximately in the first true leaf stage, and
aphids were left to reproduce for seven days under greenhouse conditions.              In another
embodiment, aphids were left to reproduce for 14 days on plants initially 20 days old at the
beginning of the experiment, approximately in the third true leaf stage. At the end of each
embodiment, aphid numbers were counted and recorded per individual plant. The presence
of Beauveria bassiana or Paecilomyces lilacinus as an endophyte in cotton significantly
reduced the reproduction of cotton aphids on endophyte treated plants versus untreated
control plants (Fig. 4A, 4B, and Fig. 5)

             Example 8: Fungal Endophytes Reduce Nematode Reproduction
        [0119]    Plants were germinated from treated and untreated control seeds in an
environment chamber and then transplanted to soil in pots 11 days after planting.          Two
replicate seedlings per treatment were sampled to examine the endophyte colonization
efficiency by surface sterilization and plating on PDA agar. Nematode treatment group
seedlings were treated with either 2,000 or 10,000 eggs/plant at day six after transplanting.
Plants were harvested and processed 6 weeks after nematode inoculation. The numbers of
galls per gram of root tissue and total egg numbers in the population for each plant were
quantified to compare nematode performance between endophyte-treated and untreated
(control) plants.
        [0120]    Fig. 2 and 3 demonstrate that the endophytic fungi Paecilomyces lilacinus
and Chaetomium globosum negatively affected root knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita)
reproduction when present as an endophyte in cotton. At high nematode inoculum levels
(10,000 eggs), Paecilomyces lilacinus reduced egg production in plants following treatment
of seeds with solutions containing either 106 or 107 spores/ml when compared to untreated
control seeds. At field inoculum levels (2000 eggs), the presence of Paecilomyces lilacinus
significantly reduced both galls and egg production at both seed treatment concentrations.
Endophytic Chaetomium globosum negatively affects root-knot nematode reproduction.
Negative effects of endophytic Chaetomium globosum on root-knot nematode gall formation
and egg production were demonstrated following cotton seed soaking treatments in solutions
of 0 (untreated controls), 106 and 108 spores/ml.
                    Example 9: Effect of Fungal Endophytes on Insects
        [0121]    Endophyte-treated and control plants were grown from non-transgenic
cotton seeds (Gossypium hirsutum)(variety LA122, AllTex Seed Co.). Seeds were soaked for
24 hours in beakers containing 108 spores/ml solutions of the fungi utilized plus sterile water
only as a control. The beakers were placed in a 32'C culture chamber overnight (approx. 9h)
until planting the next day.      The plants were grown under both greenhouse and field
conditions. Greenhouse plants were first germinated in seedling trays and then transferred to
30cm pots. Field grown plants were concurrently planted and grown.
        [0122]    Behavioral assays: No-choice and choice behavioral assays were conducted
to compare the response of western tarnished plant bugs (L. hesperus) and green stink bugs
(N. viridula) to squares and bolls from endophyte-treated and untreated plants. The assays
were conducted at 30'C in 10cm diameter petri dishes with a thin layer of 2% agar on the

bottom to provide moisture for the squares (L. hesperus assays) and bolls (N. viridula assays)
from experimental plants offered to the insects during the observations.         For no-choice
assays, a single square or boll was inserted by the base into the agar in the center of the dish.
A single young adult (1-7 days post molt) insect was placed in each dish and covered with the
top. A total of 30 insects were observed in each trial with N=10 insects each in the Beauveria
bassiana, Paecilomyces lilacinus and control treatment groups.       The L. hesperus no-choice
trials were replicated four times (N=40 per treatment) with squares from greenhouse grown
plants used in all but one trial. The N. viridula no-choice trials were replicated three times
(N=20 per treatment) with bolls from greenhouse grown plants used in one trial.
        [0123]     Choice tests were conducted under the similar conditions using the same
arenas, but with two equal sized squares (L. hesperus) or bolls (N. viridula)placed 4cm apart
in the center of the petri dish. The two squares or bolls per arena were from an untreated
control plant and either a Beauveria bassianaor Paecilomyces lilacinus treated plant. A total
of 20 insects were observed in each trial, with N=10 each in the Beauveria bassiana vs.
control and Paecilomyces lilacinus vs. control treatment groups.        The L. hesperus and N.
viridula choice trials were both replicated twice (N=20 per treatment) with squares from
field-grown plants in all trials.
        [0124]     Insects were observed for 6 hours per trial using a point sampling procedure
for both the no-choice and choice assays. Preliminary observations indicated that the insects
of both species were more active at the beginning of the assay, thus staged sampling schedule
was adopted with observations recorded at 5 minute intervals early in the assay (0-60 min),
15 minute intervals in the middle (61-180 min) and 30 minute intervals late (181-360 min) in
the assay. At each sampling interval, the insects were recorded as either off the square/boll or
feeding or roosting upon the square/boll.
        [0125]     Data analysis: In the no-choice assays, the proportion of insects observed
either feeding or resting upon cotton squares (L. hesperus) or bolls (N. viridula) was
compared between treatment groups at each observation point across the duration of the assay
using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test. To test for variation in responses over time, for each
individual the proportion of observations either feeding or upon the plant sample was
calculated for early (0-60 min), middle (61-180 min) and late (181-360 min) periods of the
assay and compared across treatment groups using a repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with the endophyte treatment group as the main factor and time as the repeat
effect. The observed frequency of individuals failing to make contact with squares or bolls

to do so based on the control group using a X2 test. Among the insects that did make contact
with either a square or boll, the time to first contact (latency) was compared among treatment
groups using a one-way ANOVA. All analyses including tests of normality and homogeneity
of variances were conducted in SPSS 21 (SPSS Inc.).
        [0126]     Results of the L. hesperus no-choice assays: Over the duration of the assay,
a significantly higher proportion of L. hesperus individuals over time was observed in contact
with and feeding upon squares from untreated control plants relative to those from either of
the Beauveria bassiana or Paecilomyces lilacinus endophyte treatment groups (Wilcoxon
Signed Ranks test, P < 0.0001 for both comparisons) (Figure 6A).               Repeated measures
ANOVA indicated a significant effect of time (F 1,116         = 86.175; P < 0.001) with a higher
proportion of insects contacting the square as the assay progressed (Figure 6B). There was
also a significant effect of endophyte treatment (F2 ,1 1 6 = 4.929; P = 0.009) with no significant
time X endophyte treatment interaction (F2 , 11 6 =  1.015; P = 0.366). Of the 40 insects in each
treatment group, 12.5% of the control group failed to make contact with the square over the
course of the assay, while a significantly higher 35% and 32.5% the Beauveria bassiana and
Paecilomyces lilacinus treatment group insect respectively failed to make contact (X2 test, P
< 0.0001). Among the insects that did make contact with a square, there was significant
difference in the latency to first contact among the treatment groups (F2 ,8 5 = 7.225; P <
0.0001) with the control group exhibiting a shorter latency to contact than either the
Beauveria bassiana (posthoc LSD test; P = 0.001) or Paecilomyces lilacinus endophyte

        [0127]     Results of the L. hesperus choice assays: In simultaneous choice tests, L.
hesperus individuals selected squares from untreated control plants more often than those
from endophyte-treated plants. Response ratios were significantly greater than 0.5 over the
duration of the assays, indicating that the insects non-randomly selected bolls from control
plants over bolls from plants endophytically colonized by either (A) Beauveria bassiana(P <
0.0001; Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test) or (B) Paecilomyces lilacinus (P < 0.0001; Wilcoxon

             Example 10: More Bolls are Retained after Endophyte Treatment
        [0129]     During the field trial, cotton phenology and development was quantified
using a plant mapping and information system developed specifically for cotton to track fruit
development and retention by the plant as a means of monitoring plant development and
stress (COTMAN Tm , Cotton Inc.).          One measure of cotton stress is the retention of
developing flowers (squares) and fruits (bolls) in the first fruiting position on branches. First
position squares and bolls were measured on 5 plants per row in two rows in each of the five
replicate plots (N=10 plants per plot) for each treatment group.
        [0130]     Fig. 10 demonstrates that early in the growing season as flowers begin to
develop, a trend for higher square retention in the endophyte-treated plants relative to
controls was observed. This trend continued later in the season as evidenced by significantly
higher boll retention among the endophyte treatment groups relative to the untreated control
plants.
        [0131]     Fig. 8 demonstrates reduction in cotton boll damage during field trials.
Relative to control plants, levels of insect-related boll damage were lower among plants that
were treated by soaking seeds in spore solutions of Beauveria bassiana and Paecilomyces
lilacinus at concentrations of 106 and 108 spore/ml. Positive effects of fungal endophytes on

                     Example 11: Endophyte Treatment Increases Yield
        [0132]     At the end of the field trial employing endophyte treatment and treatment
plants, plots were machine harvested with a 1-row picker. Surprisingly, the final yields at
harvest were significantly higher than expected (25% higher than the untreated controls).
Unexpectedly, treatment with Paecilomyces lilacinus or Beauveria bassiana resulted in
higher yields than untreated control plants with regardless of the initial seed treatment
concentration. (Fig. 11)
       Example 12: Endophyte Treatment of Sorghum increased growth in the GH
        [0133]     The effect of the described microbial compositions on sorghum was tested
in a seedling assay. Sorghum bicolor seeds were surface sterilized using ethanol and bleach
as described in Example 1 for cotton. Three strains (B. bassiana, P. fumosoroseus, and P.
lilacinus) were prepared as conidia suspensions at 107 conidia/ml, and coated on the sorghum
seeds as described in Example 1. Control seeds were soaked in sterile water instead of a
conidia suspension. Planted seeds were held in constant growth chamber conditions for two
weeks at a replication of 10. At the end of two weeks, the plants were removed from the
growth chamber and the plant height and biomass were measured. Fig. 12A shows the
increase in plant height when applied with the described microbial composition relative to the
control (p < 0.05). Fig. 12B shows the increase in plant biomass in plants grown from seed
that were treated with the described microbial composition relative to the control (p < 0.05).
               Example 13: Treatment with fungal endophytes modulates the
                        colonization frequencies of native endophytes
        [0134]     To determine     whether endophyte     seed treatments could alter the
microbiome of the plant grown from the seed, cotton seeds were treated with spore
suspensions of Paecilomyces lilacinus or Beauveria bassiana. Plants were grown in the field
as part of a field trial planted and maintained under standard agricultural practices.
Endophytic fungi were isolated on PDA media separately from surface-sterilized above
ground stem/leaf and below-ground root tissue to assess changes in the microbial community.
The comparison shown in Fig. 13 is relative to the fungal endophyte communities in
untreated control plants. The results show that these treatments can alter the colonization
rates of native fungal endophytes.
        [0135]     Fungal endophyte treatments may alter the colonization frequencies of any
of the fungal endophytes naturally present in plants.       To determine what other native
endophytes may be affected by seed treatments with fungal endophytes, the identity of cotton

fungal endophytes isolated from plants of two commercial cotton varieties, CG3787B2RF
and PIIY499WRF, were assessed. The samples were obtained during a variety trial near
Lubbock, Texas, USA identified as Lubbock-RACE. One single healthy leaf was collected
from each of nine individual plants sampled per variety across multiple replicate plots
arranged in a randomized block design to control for spatial variation in the field. To identify
the fungal endophyte species, whole genomic DNA was extracted and the ribosomal DNA
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified as a barcode for 454 pyrosequencing
using ITSiF forward and ITS2 reverse universal fusion primers.           The fungal endophytes
identified in this experiment, along with those shown in Fig. 13, are listed in Table 2.

           Example 14: Fungal endophyte seed treatment leads to modulation of
                     phytohormone levels in plants grown from the seed.
        [0136]     To   determine   whether     fungal   endophyte  seed   treatment  affects
phytohormone levels in plants grown from the seed, tissue was harvested from the root or
third true leaf of cotton plants inoculated with either endophytic Beauveria bassiana or
Paecilomyces lilacinus.       The experiment was done with three endophyte treatments
(uncolonized control, B. bassiana or P. lilacinus) and, for Beauveria bassiana,two herbivory
treatments (no aphids, or aphid herbivory for either 1, 4, 8, 24 or 48 hours). Phytohormone
levels for abscisic acid (ABA), tuberonic acid (12-OH-JA, an oxidation product of JA-Ile)
(TA), ascorbi acid (AA), 12 -Oxophytodinic acid (a JA precursor) (OPDA), JA isoleucine
(JA-Ile), and salicylic acid (SA) were assessed by LC-MS in leaf and root tissues separately.
All phytohormone level comparisons were made versus plants in the uncolonized control
group with significance at P < 0.05. Phytohormone levels in plants grown from seed treated
with Beauveria bassiana are shown in Table 3, and phytohormone levels in plants grown
from seed treated with Paecilomyces lilacinus are shown in Table 4.

            Example 15: Fungal endophyte seed treatments alter traits in certain cotton
    cultivars in field trials
         [0137]    The 2014 field trials were executed in a similar fashion as described in
Example 6. A field trial using isolates of listed below was conducted during the summer.
Each plot consisted of four 15.24 m (40 ft) rows, each separated by 101.6 cm (40 in), and
there were 6 replicate plots per treatment. Yield from plots treated with the described
microbial compositions was compared relative to the untreated control plots. For thrips, this
damage assessment was on a scale of 0 - 5; 0 = no damage, 1 = noticeable feeding scars, but
no stunting, 2 = noticeable feeding and 25% stunting, 3 = feeding with blackened leaf
terminals and 50% stunting, 4 = severe feeding and 75% stunting, and 5 = severe feeding and
90% stunting. For fleahoppers, the number of insects per plant were quantified and reported
as an average for each plot. Fig. 14 shows the yield improvement of crops when treated with
the described microbial compositions, for Delta Pine and Phytogen cultivars, respectively.
Fig. 15 shows the aggregated yield improvement of the microbes across the two cultivars.
Bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Fig. 16A shows the beneficial effect of 12 out of 15
microbial compositions tested on thrip damage in the Delta Pine cultivar. In the Phytogen
cultivar, only 2 out of the 15 microbial compositions tested showed a benefit by reducing
thrip damage. Fig. 16B shows the beneficial effect of reducing fleahopper damage in the
Phytogen cultivar, where 6 out of the 15 facultative fungal endophytes tested showed an
average decrease in fleahopper damage as compared to untreated cotton plants. In the Delta
Pine cultivar, only one microbial composition showed a beneficial effect on fleahopper
damage.
         [0138]    A number of other mid-season plant traits were also assessed in the field to
determine the effect of the described fungal endophyte compositions. Fig. 17A shows the
beneficial increase of the described microbial compositions on mid-season mean root length.
Fig. 17B shows the beneficial increase of the described fungal endophyte compositions on
mid-season belowground weight. Fig. 18 shows the beneficial increase of the described
fungal endophyte compositions on mid-season canopy temperature for both Delta Pine and
Phyton cultivars. Fig. 19 shows the beneficial increase of the described fungal endophyte
compositions on mid-season NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) for both Delta
Pine and Phytogen cultivars. NDVI is a measure of chlorophyll content. Fig. 20 shows the
beneficial increase of the described fungal endophyte compositions on mid-season first

        Example 16: Fungal endophyte seed treatments provide drought tolerance
                             in cotton cultivars in greenhouse trials
        [0140]      Cotton plants were germinated from endophyte-treated and untreated
control seeds in the greenhouse. All seeds watered for 7 days or until cotyledon stage using
pre-determined soil saturation volume of water per plant. At 7 DAP, water was withheld from
water stressed plants while controls continued to be watered. Time to wilt and time to death
were measured at a max of 21 DAP. The data in Figure 24 shows the mean time to wilt, and
the data in Figure 25 shows the mean time to death. Endophyte treatment increased the
survival of plants subjected to drought stress in both the Delta Pine (DTP) and the Phytogen
(PHY) cultivars. In Figures 24 and 25, endophyte number 194 is Epicoccum nigrum , 249 is
Cladosporium cladosporioides, 355 is Chaetomium globusum, 46 is Epicoccum sp., 463 is
