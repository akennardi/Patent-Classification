                         MAILBOX COMPRISING                     TWO COMPARTMENTS
   The      present       invention             relates         to   a   mailbox,         comprising     at
   least       two       compartments,                   a     first       compartment           for    the
   reception          of     letters           or     packages          of    small      dimensions      or
 5 sizes,       in     particular              of     small       thicknesses,            and   a    second
   compartment             for        the        reception            of     packages         of     larger
   dimensions           or     sizes,         in    particular           of     larger     thicknesses,
   each compartment having a respective access door.
   It    is   already         known        in     the     prior      art     mailboxes        having    two
10 compartments,                for         example           in       US      patent        application
   2009/0084836.             The two compartments each have an access door
   and      a  respective             distinct           lock.      Furthermore,           a   trap    door
   allows      passage         between           the two         compartments,           the   trap    door
   opening       itself         when       the      door      of the       first      compartment       has
15 been opened and closed again in succession. The user(s),                                              in
   particular           the       owner        and      the      postman,         in    order     to   have
   access        to      the       two        compartments,               operate(s)          each     lock
   independently              of     the      other,         so    as    to     have     access     to  the
   compartments.             Also,         only       the     registered           courier      companies
20 having       a    master          key,         for      example        the      Post     Office,     can
   deposit packages.
   The      present       invention             aims       to    provide        a   mailbox      in   which
   any      deliveryman            may       deposit          a    package         in    the    dedicated
   compartment           without           needing          the    key     or     of   a   key    allowing
25 the unlocking of the lock of the package compartment, while

                                                      2
   at    the   same      time     allowing the             closing    and the      locking of
   the package compartment once the package has been deposited
   but     allowing         the     owner        of    the     mailbox     to   collect        his
   letters and packages with the use of a single key.
 5 As per the present invention, a mailbox comprising at least
   two compartments, a first compartment for receiving letters
   and     a   second          compartment           for      receiving     packages,        each
   compartment          comprising           a   respective        access     door,    wherein
   locking      means       being     provided           for   locking    the   door    of the
10 second compartment, the arrangement being such that opening
   of the door of the                first       compartment        unlocks     said locking
   means,     so that the door of the second compartment                              can then
   be opened.
   Consequently,            when     the       deliveryman         comes    for    depositing
15 letters      and      more     voluminous            packages,      he   introduces         the
   letters       in     the     previously            locked      first    compartment,         in
   particular        through        a    slit      of     small   thickness     made    in     the
   door of the           first     compartment             (classical    compartment        of a
   mailbox) and places the packages in the second compartment,
20 the     door     thereof         being        previously         open    or    closed       but
   unlocked. He then closes the door of the second compartment
   and     locks    it.        When   the       owner       comes   to  take     his   letters
   and/or       packages,           he      unlocks          the    door    of     the     first
   compartment          in     which     the     letters       are   present,     the    system
25 being     arranged          so   that       this      unlocking     also    triggers        the
   unlocking of the door of the                          second compartment,         so    as to
   give access to the packages,                        and this eventhough the owner
   only have a single key allowing the unloking of the mailbox
   as a whole.

                                                  3
   In  a   preferred       embodiment           of     the      present        invention,         the
   locking    means      of    the   door       of     the       second      compartment          for
   packages     can take three           states,           one     in   which the         door is
   opened,    one    in   which the door is                  closed but unlocked,                 and
 5 one in which the door is closed and locked.
   The   deliveryman,        in   front of the mailbox with the door of
   the   second     compartment        in      the      closed        but    unlocked       state,
   can open it to deposit the package and then close it in the
   locked state.
10 As  per   a   feature       of the present                invention,         in    the   locked
   state,   the device         can no longer be operated,                        in    particular
   manually,     to make it         pass      in    the closed or opened                  states,
   except    by   the unlocking          of the           first       door     leading to the
   unlocking of the second door.
15 As   per    another      embodiment            of      the     present         invention,          a
   mailbox     comprising        two    compartments,                a   first       compartment
   for    receiving        letters         and        a       second       compartment            for
   receiving        packages,          each           compartment               comprising            a
   respective      access door,         first        locking means being provided
20 for   locking the        door     of the         first        compartment          and   second
   locking means        being      provided         for       locking       the     door   of the
   second      compartment,           is         characterised                 in      that       the
   arrangement      is    such that        the unlocking of the door of the
   second    compartment         locked       by     the      second      locking        means      is
25 accomplished        by   the     unlocking           of      the    door      of    the    first
   compartment locked by the first locking means.
   Embodiments      of the present              invention           are    described       in     the
   following description,             only as an example,                    in    reference        to

                                                 4
   the   appended         drawings,        in    which     the    only        figure      is      a
   partially      exploded         perspective       view    of a     first      embodiment
   of a mailbox of the present invention.
   As   shown     in     the      figure,     the     mailbox     comprises          a    first
 5 compartment       for     letters      of small       thicknesses          and a     second
   compartment       for      pakages      of    larger      thicknesses.           There       is
   provided     a   first       door    1   for     gaining     access       to   the     first
   compartment        from      the    outside       and    a   second        door     10     for
   gaining access to the second                   compartment       from the outside.
10 In  the   door      1   is     formed    a   slit     having    a    limit      thickness
   allowing    the passage            for letters        of small       thicknesses           but
   not for pakages of larger thicknesses.
   The door 1 for gaining access to the letters compartment is
   fitted with a specific profile in the form of a projection
15 13   fixed      to      the       door     1     and    projecting           inside        the
   compartment perpendicularly to the plane of the door 1. The
   device comprises a control axis 2 in the form of a stem, a
   return   spring 3,          a keeper 5,         a spring 6,       a keeper         guide       7
   fixed to the control axis 2, a bolt 8, made of a profile or
20 cam 8a for opening/closing of the door and of a profile or
   cam 8b for the locking of the door,                       fixed in        rotation with
   the cam 8a for opening/closing                     of the door and a lever or
   handle 9 for manual control.
   The door 10        for gaining access              to the package            compartment
25 comprises      a     lug      15   taking       part    in    the      opening       and/or
   closing of the           door 10.       The keeper        guide     7,     fixed to the
   axis 2,   is    guided through an opening 33 made in                          a plate 34
   projecting      laterally         of the lateral wall             30     in   the    second
   compartment.        Also,       the  movement        of the     keeper       guide      7    is

                                                 5
   limited        in   th     upward      direction          by   a   upper        plate    32
   projecting laterally from the lateral wall 30 in the second
   compartment, at a distance from the plate 34. In the keeper
   guide 7, a keeper 5 is movably guided while urged downwards
 5 by the spring 6.
   Furthermore, there are provided locking means for the first
   door 1, for example a classical key lock 12.
   An upper part of the control axis                        2 extends       itself     in  the
   first     compartment       below the projection 13.                 The axis       2 goes
10 through       the   floor     31    of   the     first      compartment         so   as  to
   extend in the second compartment to cooperate with the bolt
   8.
   In    a first     state     (F),    closed but unlocked,               the door 1       for
   letters        of   small      sizes      is     closed       and     locked       by   its
15 corresponding         locking means.           The     projection       13 rests again
   the upper end of the control axis                        2 by pushing the latter
   downwards        against      the    spring       3    which    bears       against     the
   floor 31, the axis 2 in the shape of a stem passing through
   the floor 31 between the two compartments                          respectively         for
20 letters       and packages.         The   cam     8a,     fixed   in     rotation      with
   said cam 8b,         is    controlled        in    rotation      with the handle           9
   and the       corresponding         axis    of the handle           9,     the handle      9
   and     the     two    cams      8a   and      8b    being     fixed        in   rotation
   together. The cam 8a cooperates with the lug 15. The cam 8b
25 cooperates        with the keeper 5             at the lower        end of the axis
   2.
   In    the opened state           (0),   the lug 15 is           not blocked by the
   cam     8a,   the   latter      having     its     rectilinear         profile      on the

                                                       6
   side of the lug 15,                so that the cam 8a cannot                   interpose        itself
   between the door 10 and the lug 15.                         In the closed position, the
   cam        8a,    through       a   900     rotation,       has     come      in     interposition
   between the lug 15 and the door 10.
 5
   Starting          from      the   closed      state,      the    deliveryman           rotates        the
   handle         9  from      the   closed      state     (F)    to   the    opened        state       (0),
   which has the effect of pivoting the cam 8a to free the lug 15
   and allow           opening of        the door.       The     door    10   is     opened and          the
10 deliveryman            can    deposit      the   package       and    then     close      again       the
   door and rotate the handle 9 by 1800 up to the locked state                                            (V)
   in       which on one part           the cam 8a        is    blocking the           lug 15 and on
   another          part    the    cam   8b has      pivoted       sufficiently           so   that      the
   keeper         5  has     come    into     the   slot      11   under     the      action      of     the
15 spring          6.    The     door    1    being     closed       and    the       projection           13
   pressing against the axis 2, the keeper 5 is pressed inside the
   slot 11 and cannot exit therefrom. The rotating of the handle 9
   is then no more possible and the door 10 is closed and locked.
   The opening through a key or an equivalent                               means of the letter
20 compartment moves               apart the door          1 and frees         the axis 2         of the
   pressure exerted by the projection 13.                           The spring 3 pushes back
   the        axis    2   upwards,      moving      also     upwards       the      keeper      5    which
   exits from the slot 11.                   The handle        9 can again be operated and
