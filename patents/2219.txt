Abstract
A method of gaming in a gaming machine having a display and a
game controller, the display having a plurality of display
positions. The method comprises conducting, via the game
controller, a play round comprising selecting, via the game
controller, a first set of symbols from a plurality of available
symbols that includes at least one special symbol, displaying
the selected first set of symbols at a respective display
positions, and determining, via the game controller, a game
outcome based on the first set of symbols and any special
symbols that are selected and displayed. The method comprises
conducting, via the game controller, one or more further play
rounds until an end condition is met. Each further play round
comprises determining, via the game controller,         if two or more
special symbols are displayed at respective first display
positions from the previous round, and if so retaining the two
or more special symbols for the further round, if two or more
special symbols are displayed at the respective first display
positions, selecting, via the game controller,        new and
different display positions at random for each of the two or
more retained special symbols based upon a first set of
predetermined displacement rules, selecting, via the game
controller,  a further set of symbols from a plurality of
available display symbols, displaying the selected further set
of symbols at respective display positions, and determining, via
the game controller,  a further game outcome based on the
further set of symbols and the two or more retained special
symbols, determining, via the gaming controller, if any two or
more of the retained special symbols have been randomly moved to
a same display position, combining, via the gaming controller,
the two or more special symbols when the same display position
is randomly selected for the at least two special symbols, and
moving, via the gaming controller, the combined symbol in
subsequent further rounds based on a second set of predetermined
displacement rules.

   Detailed Description
15
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   arranged to implement a game where at least one special symbol
   is retained for one or more play rounds but is displayed at a
   randomly determined new display position after each play round.
20 The gaming system can take a number of different forms.
   In a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing the
   game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
25
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided wherein
   some of the components required for implementing the game are
   present in a player operable gaming machine and some of the
   components required for implementing the game are located
30 remotely relative to the gaming machine.   For example, a "thick
   client" architecture may be used wherein part of the game is
   executed on a player operable gaming machine and part of the
   game is executed remotely, such as by a gaming server; or a
   "thin client" architecture may be used wherein most of the game
35 is executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible and/or
   visible gaming information to the player and receive gaming
                                             9880480_1 (GHKatters) P62710.AU.5 17/01/18

                                  10
   inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided wherein
 5 a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server and the
   respective functions of the gaming machine and the gaming server
   are selectively modifiable.  For example, the gaming system may
   operate in stand alone gaming machine mode, "thick client" mode
   or "thin client" mode depending on the game being played,
10 operating conditions, and so on.  Other variations will be
   apparent to persons skilled in the art.
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system comprises several
   core components.  At the broadest level, the core components are
15 a player interface 50 and a game controller 60 as illustrated in
   Figure 1.  The player interface is arranged to enable manual
   interaction between a player and the gaming system and for this
   purpose includes the input/output components required for the
   player to enter instructions and play the game.
20
   Components of the player interface may vary from embodiment to
   embodiment but will typically include a credit mechanism 52 to
   enable a player to input credits and receive payouts, one or
   more displays 54 and a game play mechanism 56 that enables a
25 player to input game play instructions.
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the player
   interface and typically includes a processor 62 that processes
   the game play instructions in accordance with game play rules
30 and outputs game play outcomes to the display.        Typically, the
   game play instructions are stored as program code in a memory 64
   but can also be hardwired.  Herein the term "processor" is used
   to refer generically to any device that can process game play
   instructions in accordance with game play rules and may include:
35 a microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device or
   other computational device, a general purpose computer              (e.g. a
   PC) or a server.

                                   11
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming machine 10
   is illustrated in Figure 2.  The gaming machine 10 includes a
   console 12 having a display 14 on which is displayed
 5 representations of a game 16 that can be played by a player.                    A
   mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10 houses a bank of buttons 22
   for enabling a player to interact with the gaming machine, in
   particular during gameplay.  The mid-trim 20 also houses a
   credit input mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin
10 input chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.    Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card reader for
   reading a smart card, debit card or credit card.         A reading
   device may also be provided for the purpose of reading a player
   tracking device, for example as part of a loyalty program.                  The
15 player tracking device may be in the form of a card, flash drive
   or any other portable storage medium capable of being read by
   the reading device.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example pay
20 tables and details of bonus awards and other information or
   images relating to the game.  Further artwork and/or information
   may be provided on a front panel 29 of the console 12.               A coin
   tray 30 is mounted beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing
   cash payouts from the gaming machine 10.
25
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen device.
   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid crystal display,
   plasma screen, any other suitable video display unit, or the
30 visible portion of an electromechanical device.         The top box 26
   may also include a display, for example a video display unit,
   which may be of the same type as the display 14, or of a
   different type.

                                   12
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101 having a
   processor 102.  Instructions and data to control operation of
   the processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
 5 communication with the processor 102.   Typically, the gaming
   machine 100 will include both volatile and non-volatile memory
   and more than one of each type of memory, with such memories
   being collectively represented by the memory 103.
10 The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring player
   credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for communicating
   with peripheral devices of the gaming machine 100.            The
   input/output interface 105 and/or the peripheral devices may be
15 intelligent devices with their own memory for storing associated
   instructions and data for use with the input/output interface or
   the peripheral devices.   A random number generator module 113
   generates random numbers for use by the processor 102.                Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to random
20 numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 comprise one or more displays 106, a touch screen
25 and/or buttons 107, a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a coin
   output mechanism 111.   Additional hardware may be included as
   part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware may be omitted as
   required for the specific implementation.
30
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a communications
   interface, for example a network card 112.      The network card
   may, for example, send status information, accounting
   information or other information to a central controller, server
35 or database and receive data or commands from the central
   controller, server or database.

   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of an
   exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM 103A, EPROM
   103B and a mass storage device 103C.   The RAM 103A typically
   temporarily holds program files for execution by the processor
 5 102 and related data.   The EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device
   and/or may contain some system or game related code.              The mass
   storage device 103C is typically used to store game programs,
   the integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B or
10 elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the gaming
   machine 100 to be distributed, for example input/output devices
   106,107,108,109,110,111 to be provided remotely from the game
15 controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.   The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
20 Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of two
   gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the network
   201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player operable
   interface and may be the same as the gaming machines 10,100
   shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have simplified functionality
25 depending on the requirements for implementing game play.                    While
   banks 203 of two gaming machines are illustrated in Figure 5,
   banks of one, three or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the network
30 201.  The displays 204 may, for example, be associated with one
   or more banks 203 of gaming machines.   The displays 204 may be
   used to display representations associated with game play on the
   gaming machines 202, and/or used to display other
   representations, for example promotional or informational
35 material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements part of
                                              9880480_1 (GHIatters) P62710.AU.5  17/01/18

                                   14
   the game played by a player using a gaming machine 202 and the
   gaming machine 202 implements part of the game.         With this
   embodiment, as both the game server and the gaming device
   implement part of the game, they collectively provide a game
 5 controller.   A database management server 206 may manage storage
   of game programs and associated data for downloading or access
   by the gaming devices 202 in a database 206A.        Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot game,
   a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to carry out accounting
10 functions for the Jackpot game. A loyalty system 212 may also be
   provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements most or
   all of the game played by a player using a gaming machine 202
15 and the gaming machine 202 essentially provides only the player
   interface.   With this embodiment, the game server 205 provides
   the game controller.   The gaming machine will receive player
   instructions, pass these to the game server which will process
   them and return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
20 display.   In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines could
   be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software that provides a
   player interface operable using standard computer input and
   output components.
25 Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for example
   a gaming floor management server 208, and a licensing server 209
   to monitor the use of licenses relating to particular games.                     An
   administrator terminal 210 is provided to allow an administrator
30 to run the network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming network 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate network,
   and/or a wide area network such as the Internet, for example
35 through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in accordance
                                              9880480_1 (GH~atters) P62710.AU.5 17/01/18

                                   15
   with known techniques, functionality at the server side of the
   network may be distributed over a plurality of different
   computers.   For example, elements may be run as a single
   "engine" on one server or a separate server may be provided.
 5 For example, the game server 205 could run a random generator
   engine.   Alternatively, a separate random number generator
   server could be provided.   Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of games servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server may run
10 a plurality of different games as required by the terminals.
   Gaming systems for implementing games that involve a display of
   spinning reels as part of the display of the outcome of a game
   have either a video display or a mechanical display, these later
15 machines most usually being "stepper" machines which have a
   separate motor for each reel.
   The game controllers of such gaming machines have a stop
   determining function that determines the stop position for each
20 reel.   For example, if there are five reels, each having twenty
   symbols, the stop determining function might determine that the
   stop positions are positions: 3, 13, 7, 9 and 17.            The spinning
   of the reels is then controlled so that each symbol comes to a
   stop in the same row, typically a predetermined row in a
25 "window" visible to the player on the display that which
   corresponds to a player playing a single win line.            When a reel
   stops, the symbols will be in one of a plurality of possible
   symbol positions for that reel relative to the stop position.
30 Embodiments of the present invention relate to gaming systems
   that allow a player to select how many win lines of a plurality
   of win lines they will play in each game - i.e. a minimum of one
   win line up to the maximum number of win lines allowed by the
   game.   Each win line is formed by a set of symbol positions
35 consisting of one symbol position from each reel.            That is, a
   predetermined symbol position of each reel is assigned to a win
   line.   The symbol positions that constitute each of the win
                                              9880480_1 (GHKatters) P62710.AU.5 17/01/18

                                   16
   lines are usually advertised to the player by markings on the
   display or diagrams showing the symbol positions that correspond
   to each win line.  Some of the win lines will be horizontal or
   diagonal lines but others may be other combinations of symbols.
 5 Typically, the win lines will be constituted by symbol positions
   in the visible window.
   Persons, skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, the player may obtain a win entitlement by select a
10 number of reels to play. Such games are marketed under the trade
   name "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd. The
   selection of the reel means that each symbol of the reel can be
   substituted for a symbol at one or more designated display
   positions. In other words, all symbol positions of a selected
15 reel can be used to form symbol combinations with designated,
   displayed symbol positions of other reels.
   In other embodiments a player may purchase access to particular
   pay tables - e.g. a first bet amount entitles the player to wins
20 including cherries and a second amount entitles them to wins
   including plums.
   The game controller of the embodiment is shown in more detail in
   Figure 6. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the
25 game controller 60 and/or individual modules 1010-1050 of the
   game controller can be implemented by a processor executing
   appropriate program code stored in memory 64. In other
   embodiments, some modules may be provided by dedicated circuits,
   for example.
30
   The game controller incorporates a symbol selector 1010 that
   selects symbols to appear on the display 54.        Symbol selector
   1010 includes a special symbol controller for controlling
   display of the special symbol during subsequent play rounds once
35 it has appeared.  In the embodiment, the special symbol
   controller 1020 of symbol selector 1010 is configured to
   determine based on a predetermined symbol combination occurring
                                             9880480_1  (GHKatters) P62710.AU.5 17/01/18

                                   17
    (specified by condition data 1042) that a special symbol should
   be displayed 54.   In an alternative, the special symbol may be
   on one or more of the reels and accordingly would be part of
   symbol data specifying the makeup of each reel.          In this
 5 embodiment, the start condition is that the special symbol
   appears on the display as a result of the normal selection
   process of symbols by the symbol selector 1010 under control of
   the random number generator 1050.
10 Once a special symbol either occurs or is displayed in response
   to a start condition being met, the special symbol is retained
   for one or more further play rounds until an end condition,
   specified by condition data 1042, is met.     During each
   subsequent play round, the special symbol is displayed in a new
15 position by being moved at random under control of the new
   position selector 1025.   In an embodiment, the new position
   selector 1025 obtains a value from random number generator 1050
   that is used to select a displacement from a set of
   displacements defined by displacement data 1046.
20
   In some embodiments there may be more than one special symbol.
   In this case, the special symbol controller controls retainment
   and displacement of all special symbols.
25 Between each displacement of the special symbol (which will
   typically be a wild symbol that can substitute for all or some
   of the other symbols),  a new set of normal symbols are obtained,
   for example by spinning the reels again. Other special symbols
   provide some form of additional play characteristic, for example
30 a multiplier.
   The outcome generator 1030 generates outcomes based on prize
   data 1045 and game instructions 1044 after each play round.
35 The above gaming system will normally be used to implement the
   game as a feature game.   During the feature game, a set of games
   are played, described herein as play rounds, in which when a
                                              9880480_1 (GHKatters) P62710.AU.5 17/01/18

                                   18
   special symbol appears it is used to evaluate prizes and then
   the reels are spun and the symbol is retained in the window for
   use in the next game.   The special symbol moves to a randomly
   selected new location, typically by a displacement selected at
 5 random from the location from which it last appeared.
   The game is intended to be of particular interest in a game
   where the order of symbols is important in pay patterns.
10 As described above, the special symbol may be located on the
   reels and become active when it stops in the window.              In this
   embodiment, there can be more than one special symbol on the
   reel and thus the number of special symbols can accumulate
   during the feature.
15
   In another embodiment, the feature commences when a start
   condition is met, for example based on a specific symbol
   combination occurring on the reels, a special symbol is placed
   on the reel in a display location defined by the rules.
20 Additional special symbols may also be added based on other
   factors defined in the rules of the game.     The initial display
   location may, for example, be predetermined, selected at random,
   selected at random from a subset of the available display
   positions, or selected by the player.
25
   A special symbol may be displayed such that the symbol shown on
   the reel strip underneath it is not visible (in embodiments
   where the special symbol is displayed independently of the
   reels).   In an alternative embodiment, the special symbol is
30 located in a place in the window such that the symbol shown on
   the reel strip is also visible, for example next to the symbol
   or as a transparent overlay. In one example, the special symbol
   may be larger than normal symbols and "float" over a display
   position.
35
   In a further alternative, the special symbol may only be visible
   in conjunction with the symbol underneath when it appears in
                                              9880480_1 (GHKatters) P62710.AU.5 17/01/18

                                   19
   combination with certain symbols, for example, a scatter symbol
   where it is advantageous to keep both the wild and scatter
   symbols available for prize evaluations.
 5 As described above, in the embodiment the special symbol is wild
   for some or all symbols.  However, in alternative embodiments
   the special symbol may take another function for example as a
   multiplier or may act as a multiplier if more than one special
   symbol appears in the same display position.         In a further
10 alternative the special symbol may be a Jackpot symbol.
   Where the random selection of a new display position of the
   retained special symbol is made by a displacement, this may be
   restricted to a set of possible displacements.          For example, all
15 displacements correspond to positions adjacent to the current
   position, or the displacements define a "dance step" such as two
   positions up and one across, etc.   Further, the displacements
   may be allowed to wrap around the reels by moving adjacently up
   from a position from the top of the set of symbols to the bottom
20 of the reels and similarly from right to left or left to right.
   The held special symbols can be displayed in a number of
   different styles, for example:
              "walking", "dancing", "jumping" or "sliding" the
25 symbol from one position to the next prior to the reels
   spinning;
   e          "walking", "dancing", "jumping" or "sliding" the
   symbol from one position to the next as the reels are spinning;
   e          "walking", "dancing", "jumping" or "sliding" the
30 symbol from one position to the next after the reels spin; or
   e          visually disappearing as the reels are spun and then
   reappearing as the reels stop spinning.
   It is possible to have more than one special symbol appearing in
35 the window at the same time.   If more than one special symbol
   appears in the same display position, the display position shows
   all of the special symbols.  This can be visually depicted as
                                              9880480_1  (GHKatters) P62710.AU.5 17/01/18

                                   20
   the symbol changing to have all symbols in a new graphic or
   flashing between the various symbols.
   Depending on the embodiment, where more than one special symbol
 5 appears in the same display position, the subsequent moves can
   be individual moves for each symbol or, alternatively, the
   combined symbol can now move as one symbol.
   It is also possible for a special symbol to replicate as it is
10 moved, and for it to be moved in multiple directions.              For
   instance, in one embodiment, a special symbol of a Star can
   appear at Feature Game 1 and then at Feature Game 2, the Star is
   moved while being replicated as one star above the last position
   and one star below the last position.
15
   The player's eligibility for the feature can be determined in
   accordance with any one of a number of known rules including but
   not limited to:
              being available to all players for all bets;
20            being available only for certain bet types; or
              different levels of feature being available for
   different bets.  For example, standard bets may be entitled to
   one special symbol and feature bets may be entitled to
   additional special symbols.
25
   The feature can commence in accordance with any one of a number
   of known rules including but not limited to:
              when a special symbol, or a combination of symbols
   appears in the window;
30            when a time elapses;
              when a system event occurs;
              when an underlying random event occurs, for example,
   in the course of a game;
              when a turnover has elapsed.

                                   21
   code could be supplied in a number of ways, for example on a
   computer readable medium, such as a disc or a memory (for
   example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as a data
   signal  (for example, by downloading it from a server).
 5
   Example 1
   A three by five spinning reel game (five reels 740a-740e with
   three positions 750a-750c visible in the window for each reel)
10 is being played at 1 credit per line and five lines.              The game
   pays prizes in a left to right pattern only.        Three scattered
   coin symbols appear on the reels and trigger a series of eight
   feature games.
15 During the feature games, the rules of the game define that the
   "Man" special symbol and the "Woman" special symbol each acquire
   the function of substituting for other symbols.          During the
   feature, once a Man or Woman special symbol appears, the special
   symbol will remain in the window for all remaining games in this
20 feature sequence but will randomly move location.            The location
   of the displacement is defined as moving up or down on the same
   reel, or moving left to right on the same row.
   Please note that in this example the adjacent move includes a
25 "wrap" i.e. the meaning of the word "up" includes moving from
   the top line to the bottom line on the same reel.            Similarly,
   the word "down" includes moving from the bottom line to the top
   line on the same reel.   Similarly the word "left" includes
   moving from reel one to reel five and "right" includes moving
30 from reel five to reel one.
   The displacement selector randomly selects to which position the
   special symbol is to move.
35 More than one "Man" and one "Woman" can appear and be retained
   in each feature sequence.   The rules of the game define that if
   a Man and Woman occupy the same position, the visual display
                                              9880480_1 (GHKatters) P62710.AU.5 17/01/18

                                   22
   will show the Man and Woman dancing together and the prize will
   be multiplied by ten.   Similarly if two "Man" or two "Woman"
   symbols occupy the same position.
 5 In the first free game, neither a Man nor a Woman symbol appears
   on the reels.   The symbols appearing on the reels are evaluated
   and prizes paid.
   In the second free game, a Man symbol 710 appears on reel two
10 740b in the centre position 750b.   The symbols appearing in the
   window are evaluated for prizes according to the bet options
   placed by the player and using the Man as a substitute as shown
   in Figure 7A.
15 This outcome pays 3 * Aces on the centre line (Man substitutes
   for the Ace)
   In the third free game, the Man 710 remains available in the
   window but moves location.   The displacement is random but can
20 only move up or down on reel two or sideways onto reel one or
   reel three.   The reels also spin and all other symbols are
   replaced.   The outcome is shown in Figure 7B.
   The outcome pays 3* Queen on the centre line (Man substitutes
25 for Queen)
   In the fourth free game, the Man 710 remains available in the
   window but moves location.   The displacement is random but can
   only move up or down on reel one or sideways onto reel five or
30 reel two.   The reels also spin and all other symbols are
   replaced.   The outcome is shown in Figure 7C.
   The outcome pays 4* jack on the fourth payline (top left hand
   corner to middle bottom, then up to top right hand corner.                    (Man
35 substitutes for Jack)
   And 2* 9 on top line (Man substitutes for 9)
                                              9880480_1 (GHKatters) P62710.AU.5 17/01/18

                                   23
   In the fifth free game, the Man 710 remains available in the
   window but moves location.   The displacement is random but can
   only move up (to the bottom position) or down on reel one or
   sideways onto reel five or reel two.    The reels also spin and
 5 all other symbols are replaced.   On this outcome, a Woman 720
   symbol appears on reel four.   The outcome is shown in Figure 7D.
   The outcome pays 3* 9 on top line.    (Man substitutes for 9)
   And 3 * dog on the centre line.    The "Woman" does not complete a
10 prize winning combination.
   In the sixth free game, the Man 710 remains available in the
   window but moves location.   The displacement is random but can
   only move up (to the bottom position) or down on reel two or
15 sideways onto reel one or reel three.    The Woman 720 can move up
   or down (to the top position on reel four) or sideways onto reel
   three or five.  The reels also spin and all other symbols are
   replaced.  The outcome is shown in Figure 7E.
20 The outcome pays 5* Jacks on fifth payline.         (Man and Woman both
   substitute for Jack) fifth payline runs from reel one bottom
   position to reel three top position and down to bottom position
   on reel five.
25 In the seventh free game, the Man 710 remains available in the
   window but moves location.   The displacement is random but can
   only move up (to the bottom position) or down on reel three or
   sideways onto reel two or reel four.    The Woman 720 can move up
   or down or sideways onto reel three or five.         The reels also
30 spin and all other symbols are replaced.     The outcome is shown
   in Figure 7F
   The outcome pays 4* Aces on bottom payline.         (Man and Woman both
   substitute for Ace).
35
   In the eighth free game, the Man 710 remains available in the
   window but moves location.   The displacement is random but can
                                               9880480_1 (GHKatters) P62710.AU.5 17/01/18

                                   24
   only move up or down on reel three or sideways onto reel two or
   reel four.   The Woman 720 can move up or down or sideways onto
   reel three or five.   The reels also spin and all other symbols
   are replaced.   The outcome is shown in Figure 7G.
 5 The outcome pays 3* Queens on fourth payline.          (Woman
   substitutes for Queen).
   The Man does not complete a winning combination.
   Eight feature games are now complete, the end condition is met
10 and the game returns to normal play.
   The process of Example 1 is illustrated in the flow chart of
   Figure 8.   At step 800, the reels are spun in a standard game.
   At step 805, it is determined whether there is a trigger (start
15 condition) for the special feature.    If no, the standard game
   continues, if yes, the feature game is started at step 810.                     At
   step 815, it is determined what the end condition will in this
   case is the number of feature games that are available in this
   game.  At step 820, the reels are spun.    At step 825, it is
20 determined whether there is a Man symbol on the reels, as in
   this embodiment the Man symbol is one of the set of symbols
   available on at least one reel.    If the answer is yes, the
   position is noted if the answer is no, it is determined 835
   whether there is a Woman symbol on the reels.         If the answer is
25 yes, the position is noted at step 840 and prizes are evaluated
   at step 845.   If there are any Man or Woman symbols, these are
   used as substitutes otherwise the prize evaluation occurs in
   accordance with the other normal rules.    At step 850, the number
   of feature games that are available is decremented and at step
30 855 it is determined whether the number of feature games
   available has reached zero 855. If the answer is no, the process
   proceeds to   step 860, and the reels are spun, at steps 865 and
   870, new positions are determined for the man and woman if this
   is applicable.   The process then continues from step 825 until
35 it is determined at step 855 that the number of feature games
   has reached zero.   That is, that the end condition is met.
                                               9880480_1 (GHKatters) P62710.AU.5 17/01/18

                                   25
   Example 2
   This is another five reel 940a-940e by three row 950a-950c game
   where the rules are the same as Example 1 but a Man 910 and
 5 Woman 920 symbol are placed on the display at the start of the
   game.
   In the first free game, a Man symbol 910 is placed on reel two,
   centre position and a Woman symbol 920 is placed on the reel
10 four, centre position.  The symbols overlay other symbols such
   that the underlying symbols, except for scatters, cannot be seen
   and cannot be used to evaluate prizes.   The symbols appearing on
   the reels are evaluated and prizes paid.    The outcome is shown
   in Figure 9A.
15
   The prizes paid are
   4* Aces on the centre line (Man and Woman substitute for Ace)
   2*9 on the fifth payline (Man substitutes for 9)
20 In the second free game, the Man 910 symbol randomly relocates.
   The relocation can be above or below the centre position on reel
   two or to the centre position on reel one or reel three.                  The
   displacement of the Woman 920 symbol is independent of the
   displacement of the Man 910.   The Woman can move up or down on
25 reel four or sideways to reels three or five on the centre
   position.  The symbols appearing in the window are evaluated for
   prizes using the Man and Woman as a substitute.
   This outcome pays:
30 3 * Aces on the centre line (Man substitutes for the Ace)
   In the third free game, the Man 910 remains available in the
   window but moves location.   The displacement is random but can
   only move up or down on reel one or sideways onto reel five or
35 reel two.  Similarly for the relocation of the Woman 920.                   The
   reels also spin and all other symbols are replaced.             The outcome
   is shown in Figure 9B.

                                    26
   The outcome pays:
   3* Queen on the centre line (Man substitutes for Queen)
   3*9 on fifth payline (Man and woman substitute for 9)
 5 In the fourth free game, the Man 910 remains available in the
   window but moves location.    The displacement is random but can
   only move up or down on reel two or sideways onto reel one or
   reel three.   Similarly, the Woman 920 symbol must relocate.                    The
   reels also spin and all other symbols are replaced.              The outcome
10 is shown in Figure 9D.
   Note that in this outcome, the Man and Woman symbols are now in
   the same position.
   The outcome pays on top line 2* 9 prize time ten.             (Man and
15 woman at the same location pay ten times the prize and
   substitutes for 9)
   In the fifth free game, the Man 910 remains available in the
   window but moves location.    The displacement is random but can
20 only move up (to the bottom position) or down on reel two or
   sideways onto reel three or reel one.    Similarly the Woman 920
   relocates.   The reels also spin and all other symbols are
   replaced.   The outcome is show in Figure 9E.
25 The outcome pays:
   3* 9 on top line.    (Man substitutes for 9)
   3 * dog on the centre line.    (Woman substitutes for dog)
   3* Queen on fifth payline (Man and Woman substitute for Queen)
   2*9 on fourth payline   (Woman substitutes for 9)
30
   In the sixth free game, the Man 910 remains available in the
   window but moves location.    The displacement is random but can
   only move up (to the bottom position) or down on reel three or
   sideways onto reel two or reel four.    Similarly the Woman 920
35 relocates.   The reels also spin and all other symbols are
   replaced.   The outcome is shown in Figure 9F.

                                   27
   The outcome pays:
   3* Jacks on bottom payline.   (Man and Woman both substitute for
   Jack)
 5 In the seventh free game, the Man 910 remains available in the
   window but moves location.   The displacement is random but can
   only move up or down on reel three or sideways onto reel two or
   reel four.   Similarly, the Woman 920 relocates.         The reels also
   spin and all other symbols are replaced.    The outcome is shown
10 in Figure 9G.
   The outcome pays:
   4* Aces on bottom payline.   (Man and Woman both substitute for

   window but moves location.   The displacement is random but can
   only move up or down on reel two or sideways onto reel one or
20 reel three.   Similarly, the Woman 920 relocates.         The reels also
   spin and all other symbols are replaced.    The outcome is shown
   in Figure 9H.
   The outcome pays:
25 3* Queens on fifth payline.   (Man substitutes for Queen).
   Eight feature games are now complete and the game returns to
   normal play.
30 In one variation of Example 2, the Man and Woman symbols may
   move together after they appear in the same display position
   (see Figure 9D).   When they move together this may be different
   to the initial way they moved, for example, they may move in a
   two by one or one by two display position "dance step".
