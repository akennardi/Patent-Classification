claims.
                                             1

[0005] Furthermore, in the following description of embodiments, numerous specific details are
set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present technology. However, the
present technology may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well
known methods, procedures, and components have not been described in detail as not to
unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present embodiments.
[0006] Figure 1 depicts an embodiment of catheter system 100 (or catheter assembly) in a pre
insertion state. Figure 2 depicts a cross-sectional view of the catheter system 100 in the pre
insertion state. A pre-insertion state is the state of catheter system 100 prior to inserting the
catheter into a patient.
[0007] Catheter system 100 includes catheter insertion device 1 10 coupled to catheter device
130. Catheter insertion device 110 is resiliently coupled to catheter device 130 via
                                                   1A

latch 134. In one embodiment, latch 134 is a spring latch that flexibly and resiliently engages
(e.g., snap fit) with any physical features (e.g., protrusions, indentions, etc.) on housing 132
of catheter device 130. It should be appreciated that catheter insertion device 110 is coupled
to catheter device 130 without requiring a threaded coupling.
[00081      In contrast, conventional catheter systems a catheter device is coupled to an
insertion device via threads. As such, the insertion device must be rotated to couple/decouple
it from the catheter device.
[0009]      On one embodiment, latch 134 resiliently couples to internal features of catheter
device 130. In another embodiment, latch 134 is rotatable with respect to catheter device 130
when resiliently coupled to catheter device 130.
[0010]      Needle 150 is held by needle collet 120.       An end of needle 150 is disposed in
viewing chamber 122. When in the pre-insertion state, needle 150 extends through and out of
catheter device 130 and is also disposed within catheter 140.
[0011]      Moreover, in the pre-insertion state, spring 114 is compressed and abuts against
needle collet 120.
[0012]      During insertion, needle 150 and catheter 140 are inserted into a vein of a patient.
When properly inserted, blood travels within needle 150 to viewing chamber 122.                In
particular, the blood does not come into contact with any internal surface of (e.g., chamber
133) of catheter device 130 when catheter insertion device 110 is coupled to catheter device
130.
[0013]      When blood is provided in viewing chamber 122, the blood is able to be viewed
through housing 112 and needle collet 120 to provide a visual indication that needle 150 and
catheter 140 have been properly inserted into the vein. As such, both housing 112 and needle
collet 120 are either translucent or transparent.
[00141      The blood is sealed in viewing chamber by filter 124. In one embodiment, filter
124 is a hydrophobic filter. In particular, when blood enters into viewing chamber 122, air
passes through filter 124 and exits vent 126 into ambient. However, the blood is not able to
pass through filter 124.
                                                  -2-

10015]      In order to withdraw needle 150 from the vein, catheter insertion device 110 is
withdrawn from catheter device 130. However, latch 134 still remains in contact with and is
coupled to catheter device 130 via features on housing 132. During withdrawal, needle 150
is also withdrawn through catheter 140 (which remains in the vein).
[0016]      Once latch 134 is completely decoupled from catheter device 130 (e.g., latch 134
does not engage with retaining features on housing 132), spring 114 is released into its
relaxed state. In doing so, spring 114 urges needle collet 120 such that it axially slides within
chamber 116. As a result, needle 150 is completely withdrawn through catheter device 130
and is entirely disposed within housing 112, as depicted in Figure 3. In other words, needle
 150 is automatically withdrawn from the vein and through catheter device 130 when latch
 134 is decoupled from housing 132. When no longer coupled to catheter device 130, catheter
insertion device 110 may be properly discarded.
 100171     Once needle 150 is withdrawn through seal 136, seal 136 reseals. As such, blood
entering into chamber 133, via catheter 140 is sealed within chamber 133 to prevent blood
 loss. Therefore, catheter device 130 is also a closed system because blood is securely sealed
within chamber 133. In one embodiment, seal 136 is a silicone disc. In another embodiment,
seal 136 is pre-slit to facilitate in the insertion/withdrawal of device (e.g., needle 150).
 [00181     Figure 4 depicts an embodiment of extension set 180 coupled to catheter device
 130. Figure 5 depicts a cross-sectional view of extension set 180 coupled to catheter device
 130.
 100191     In order to couple extension set 180 to catheter device 130, a user grasps base 182
an inserts cannula 188 through seal 136 until coupling features 190 and 191 (e.g., tines)
mechanically couple (e.g., snap fit) with associated coupling features of housing 132. The
coupling may be provided by use of a single hand of a user.
 [00201     In contrast, in conventional systems, the extension set is rotatably coupled to the
catheter via treads.      Moreover, a user must use both hands to couple the catheter to the
extension set. For example, a user must hold onto the catheter and use the other hand to
handle the extension set and rotated with respect to the catheter.
                                                     -3-

[00211      When properly coupled, blood is able to flow through tube 186 to luer access
device 184. It should be appreciated that any compatible disposable set or extension set may
be coupled to catheter device 130.
[00221      Figures 6A-B depict an embodiment of catheter device 630. Catheter device 630
includes first section 632 that is joined to second section 634. The joining can be but is not
limited to an ultrasonic weld, adhesive, snap fit, etc. Seal 136 is placed between first section
632 and second section 634 prior to joining and is securely seated between first section 632
and second section 634 when the sections are joined at joint 638.
[00231      In one embodiment, second section 634 includes funnel 636 to facilitate in the
guiding of needle 150 through catheter device 630 during assembly such that needle 150 is
properly aligned to puncture seal 136.
100241      It should be appreciated that embodiments, as described herein, can be utilized or
implemented alone or in combination with one another. While the present invention has been
described in particular embodiments, it should be appreciated that the present invention
should not be construed as limited by such embodiments, but rather construed according to
the following claims.
