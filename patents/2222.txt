 8 [0001]      The disclosed subject matter relates to a system and method for preparing cells for
 9 diagnostic tests and procedures. Particularly, the disclosed subject matter relates to a cell block
 0 apparatus and methods for preparing a cell block.
 1                                           BACKGROUND
 2
 3 [0002]      Medicine is becoming less invasive and more personalized. For example, a patient
 4 presenting with a mass in the lung or pancreas is not necessarily scheduled for surgery to
15 characterize the lesion as neoplastic or not. Instead, a minute sample of cells from the lesion is
16 obtained through a procedure called a fine needle aspiration (FNA), which involves aspirating
17 cells with a small needle after it is localized to the site of interest with the aid of CT scan and/or
18 ultrasound.    When performing FNA, either no incision is made, or the biopsy site is
19 inconspicuous, similar to a puncture wound following a blood draw, which allows for outpatient
20 procedures and prevents need for hospitalization. By examining cells under a microscope,
21 pathologists render diagnoses of benignity or malignancy.            At one time, there were limited
                                                       1

                                                                                        011827. 50995
 2  treatment options and diagnoses of malignancy made on smears would suffice and treatment
 3  would ensue.      Nowadays, ancillary tests afford greater information about the tumor and
 4  therapeutic options that are likely to be more effective. Though minimally invasive procedures
 ,5 and personalized treatment options provide better patient care, imparting greater levels of
 6  information on even smaller tissue samples is challenging and places a greater burden on
 7  pathologists and consequences for patients.
  8 [0003]      Ancillary tests to answer the pertinent questions are frequently conducted on cell
 9  blocks, pellets of cells formed from the FNA sample, if available. Currently, there is no accepted
 0  laboratory standard on the preparation of cell blocks, though labs frequently employ one of
  1 several "homebrew" methods. When samples are large, cell blocks are easier to form, but with
 2  smaller samples, the "homebrew" methods may fail or result in a suboptimal cell block. Thus,
 3  there is a growing need to develop a standardized apparatus and method for preparing cell blocks
 4  in a low cost and efficient manner to provide answers to clinicians that impact therapeutic
 5  decisions.

 ,4 disposable cell block apparatus and a method for using the apparatus, e.g., for tumor diagnosis,
 ,5 benign diagnosis, and other ancillary tests including research and development analyses, is
 ,6 provided.    As used herein, the term "cell block" refers to a concentration of cells or solid
 ,7 particles from a biological sample, which is embedded in a medium, such as but not limited to
 ,8 paraffin wax. Thin sections from the medium with embedded cells are sliced or sectioned from
 ,9 the filter membrane of the cell block for mounting on a glass slide for analysis on a microscope
 -0 or sliced from the cell block for other analyses.    For example, visualization of the cells and the
 -1 extracellular environment can provide information to determine whether the tissue collected is
 -2 benign or malignant. Alternatively, the slices provide cellular material (DNA, RNA, proteins)
 -3 for microcellular analysis.    Although particular embodiments disclosed herein may focus on
 -4 collection of the tissue or solid particle component in a biological sample for further
 -5 diagnostics/testing, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the disclosed
 -6 apparatus and method is equally applicable for applications in which the fluid component of the
 -7 biological sample is to be the subject of further diagnostics/testing.
 -8 [0080]      In one exemplary embodiment, the apparatus is configured as a cell block apparatus
 -9 100 is shown schematically in FIG.1. Cell block apparatus 100 includes an elongate tubular
D0  body 110 and a filter assembly 120. The elongate tubular body 110 has a proximal end 112 and
51  a distal end 114. In some embodiments, the elongate tubular body 110 has a first diameter (di) at
52  the proximal end and a second diameter (d2) at the distal end, wherein the second diameter is
53  smaller than the first diameter. A section 118 disposed between the proximal end 112 and the
54  distal end 114 of the elongate tubular body 110, has a decreasing diameter along a length thereof
55  to define a generally conical distal section of the elongate tubular member 110.            In some
56  embodiments, a less gradual taper can be provided such that the elongate tubular body includes a
                                                      12

  7 step or abrupt restriction in diameter at 118. Various suitable volumes are available for elongate
  8 tubular body 110.      For purpose of illustration and not limitation, suitable volumes include
 .9 between about 15 ml to about 50 ml, or any other size that fits into a centrifuge, standard or
  0 otherwise. However, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that alternative sizes
  1 are within the scope of the disclosed subject matter. The elongate tubular body is sized to fit
  2 within a conventional centrifuge.      In this manner, the cell block apparatus can receive the
  3 biological sample, for example, from a needle housing the biological sample obtained by fine
  4 needle aspiration techniques, and be disposed in the centrifuge for separation of the cells in the
  5 biological sample from any liquid to isolate and consolidate the cells into a concentrated pellet
  6 by centrifugation. Using the same unit for receiving the biological sample and separating the
  7 biological sample into component parts reduces the loss of sample size and reduces risk of
  8 contamination due to exchange between multiple components.             In some embodiments, the
  9 elongate tubular body is suitable for relative centrifugal forces of between about 1,200 to about
 '0 16,000 RCF. For example, 12,000 RCF, 1,200 RCF, 16,000 RCF, 2,000 RCF, 9,400 RCF, 7,500
 '1 RCF. For further illustration in one embodiment, the elongate tubular member has a volume of
 '2 15 ml, and is suitable for centrifugation at 1,200 RCF or 12,000 RCF. In other embodiments, for
 '3 example, the elongate tubular member has a volume of 50 ml and is suitable for centrifugation at
74  16,000 RCF or 2,000 RCF or 9,400 RCF. The elongate tubular body of the device can be formed
75  of various materials and in particular various polymers, for example, polypropylene and/or
76  polystyrene.   Further, the materials used for the elongate tubular body, filter assembly, or
77  compressive cover, which is described below, can be biodegradable materials.
78  [0081]      Referring to FIG.2, the elongate tubular body 110 defines an opening 113 at the
79  proximal end of the body. In some embodiments, the opening 113 is closed by a lid 130. The lid
                                                      13

 .0 can be configured with thread (not shown) to engage threads 116 disposed on a proximal section
  1 of the elongate tubular body 110. However, other suitable methods and features can be used to
 .2 engage the lid 130 and elongate tubular body 110, such as interference fit or other methods of
 '3 engagement, as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiment, the
 .4 lid can be a stopper formed from a self sealing or resealable material. In this regard, the lid 130
  5 is puncturable by a needle allowing transfer of the biological sample from the needle to the
  6 interior of the elongate tubular body. After deposit of the biological sample and removal of the
  7 needle from the lid 130, the material self-seals the puncture created by the needle entry. In the
  8 exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG.2, at the distal most end 116 of the elongate tubular
  9 body 110 the structure is configured to permit the filter assembly 120 to engage.             In one
 '0 embodiment, the material of the neck 116 has a thickened wall to allow the filter assembly 120 to
 '1 securely engage the elongate tubular member 110. Further, the outer surface of the neck 116 can
 '2 be configured with a thread or a plurality of threads to permit the base member 124 to securely
 '3 engage the elongate tubular body 110.
 '4 [0082]      In some embodiments, the elongate tubular body is preloaded with a fixative. A
 '5 "fixative" as used herein refers to a compound, such as formalin, ethanol, methanol, RPMI,
96  saline for preservation of the cells.
97  [0083]      Referring to FIG.3, a top view of a filter assembly 120 in accordance with the subject
98  matter is provided.     In an exemplary embodiment, the filter assembly 120 comprises a base
99  member 124, such as a non-porous member, and a filter membrane 122 that is disposed within
00  the body of the base member.          Thus, in one embodiment, the filter assembly is removable.
01  Additionally, the entire filter assembly, including filter membrane 122 and its border (or frame)
02  is sectionable, i.e., capable of being cut or sliced into pieces or "sections" e.g., for mounting on
                                                       14

 3  a glass slide for analysis on a microscope or for other analyses such as microcellular analysis,
 14 e.g., DNA, RNA, and/or protein.      As illustrated in FIG.4, the filter membrane 122 is sized
 '5 sufficiently smaller than the base member 124 so that it can slide into the interior space defined
 '6 by the base member 124. In some embodiments, the filter membrane includes sidewalls formed
 7  of paraffin, paraform, plastic, rubber or foam. Referring back to the exemplary embodiment
 '8 depicted in FIG.1, the filter assembly 120 is associated, or coupled, with the distal end of the
 9  elongate tubular member. In this respect, the base member 124 can be configured with threads
 0  or some other engaging member to engage a distal portion of the elongate tubular body 110, and
  1 the filter membrane 122 member can be sized to engage the distal end of the elongate tubular
 2  member, for example, by an interference fit. The engagement of the filter membrane with the
 3  interior surface of the elongate tubular body provides a seal to prevent leakage around the
 4  periphery of the filter membrane.     Consequently, any fluid within the distal portion of the
 5  elongate tubular body must first pass through, and be filtered, by the filter membrane. Thus, in
 6  this exemplary embodiment, the filter membrane 122 can be slidably received by the distal
 7  portion (e.g., neck) of the elongate member.     The filter assembly 120 is detachable from the
 8  elongate tubular body. As described in detail below, the detached filter assembly 120 and its
 9  contents can be enclosed by a compressive cover 200 (as shown in FIG.8).
20  [0084]      The filter membrane 122 has a porosity sufficient to maintain the cells or cellular
21  components from the biological sample while the liquid and fixative pass through.         In some
22  embodiments, the liquid is the fixative. However, in other embodiments, the liquid and fixative
23  may be a mixture. For purpose of illustration and not limitation, in some embodiments the filter
24  membrane 122 has pores between about 0.4 pm to about 5 pim. The pore density can be about 1
25  x 108 to about 6 x 105 pores/cm2 . Thus, in some embodiments, the filter membrane has a
                                                    15

 6  porosity of 5.0 pm and a pore density of 6 x 10' pores/cm 2 . In other embodiments, the filter
 7  membrane has a porosity of 5.0 pm and a pore density of 1 x 108. However, suitable porosity and
 8  pore density can be selected depending on the cells targeted for capture. In some embodiments,
 9  the filter membrane has a thickness of about 9 to about 100 pim, such as 17 pim. Although
 0  specific ranges are provided for exemplary purposes, it will be understood by one of ordinary
  1 skill in the art that alternative sizes are within the scope of the disclosed subject matter. Suitable
 2  materials can be used to from the filer membrane. For example, in one embodiment the filter
 3  membrane is formed from polyethylene terephthalate.
 4  [0085]       The filter membrane 122, as illustrated in FIG.4, has a planar bottom surface 126 and
 5  an upwardly extending wall 128 around the periphery of the planar bottom surface 126.             The
 6  upwardly extending wall can, in some embodiments, have a planar surface.             Alternatively, as
 7  schematically shown in FIG.5, the filter membrane 222 can include an upwardly extending wall
 8  228 having one or a plurality of bellows 229 or a plurality of threads.             In an alternative
 9  embodiment, as illustrated schematically in FIG.7, the filter assembly 320 can include base
 0  member 324 having an upwardly extending wall with bellows and a filter membrane 322 having
 .1 a planar side wall. In some embodiments, the bellows provide the capability of the base member
42  or the filter membrane to adjust to sample size. The bellowed side wall compresses the cells into
43  a tablet, which further facilitates an even distribution of cells. For example, in some instances,
44  the smaller the sample, the greater the bellows will expand to create a compact pellet. The filter
45  membrane and the base member permit essential fluids for fixation and processing to enter the
46  base member but do not allow the cells to pass through.           Thus, the cells remain on the filter
47  membrane.

 8  [00861      While the filter assembly in the exemplary embodiments is depicted as two discrete
 .9 members (i.e. a filter membrane and base member), alternative configurations (e.g., an integrally
 .0 formed and unitary filter assembly) will be understood by artisans of ordinary skill to be within
  1 the scope of the disclosed subject matter.
 .2 [00871      The combination of cells can be embedded in paraffin and cut, within the filter
 .3 assembly or separately, into slices for diagnosis and ancillary tests. In other words, the filter
 .4 membrane's structural characteristics allow for a blade to slice through the membrane and base
 .5 member without flaking or splintering such that no unwanted debris is produced that might
 .6 contaminate or compromise the pellet retained within or on the membrane.           Further, the filter
 .7 assembly is of sufficient rigidity to maintain its form and orientation indicia (described in further
 .8 detail below), yet is sufficiently malleable and flexible so as to avoid damaging the cutting blade.
 .9 [00881      In this manner, the presently disclosed subject matter provides for a method for
 0  preparing a cell block in which the filter assembly remains with the specimen throughout
  1 processing to eliminate the risk of particle loss and cross contamination that can occur during
 2  various procedural steps, which involved eight transfers under prior art techniques. Additionally,
 3  the disclosed subject matter provides a standardized technique for processing samples which
64  allows for more consistency and accuracy to pathological evaluations. In some embodiments,
65  the method comprises introducing a biological sample into a cell block apparatus described
66  herein. The cell block apparatus containing the biological sample is disposed into a centrifuge to
67  centrifuge the biological sample for a sufficient amount of time to separate the cells, or tissue,
68  from the liquid component and form a pellet.           Again, for purpose of illustration and not
69  limitation, the biological sample can be centrifuged at relative centrifugal forces of between
70  about 1,200 to about 16,000 RCF for about five to ten minutes, or longer as necessitated by the
                                                       17

 2  exemplary purposes, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that alternative
 3  centrifuge times are within the scope of the disclosed subject matter.
 4  [0089]      The pellet is then processed, for example, in a cassette though any alternative suitable
 5  housing can be employed.       The cassette is placed in formalin and into a tissue processor for
 6  processing through several steps (including dehydration to remove any aqueous solutions, then
 7  clearing of dehydrant, and finally infiltration by an embedding agent, such as paraffin).       The
 8  processing time of the cellular pellet varies upon the tissue processors. In one embodiment, the
 9  processing time is less than about three hours. Then the processed pellet is embedded into a
 .0 medium to form a cell block. The medium, can be for example, paraffin, paraform, or the like.
  1 Various materials can be used for the embedding step.
 .2 [0090]      In accordance with another aspect of the disclosed subject matter, multiple cell blocks
 '3 can be formed simultaneously via batch processing in under about three hours. In such batch
 .4 processing applications, a plurality of cell block apparatuses (each including an elongate tubular
 .5 body having an interior space) is associated with a respective detachable filter assembly disposed
 .6 in communication with the interior space of the elongate tubular body. As described above, in
87  some embodiments the filter assembly includes a base member configured to engage the distal
88  end of the elongate tubular body, and a membrane having a porosity of between about 0.4 pm to
89  about 10.0 pim. Although an exemplary range is provided for illustrative purposes, it will be
90  understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that alternative sizes are within the scope of the
91  disclosed subject matter. Multiple biological samples, same or different, can be introduced into
92  the cell block apparatuses. The elongate tubular bodies can be interconnected or configured as
93  discrete units. The elongate tubular bodies are each sized sufficiently to fit into a centrifuge

 5  bodies of the cell block apparatuses. Upon completion of the centrifuge cycle, the biological
 6  samples in each cell block apparatus forms a cellular pellet ready for individual processing or
 7  embedding into a plurality of cell blocks. Accordingly, the method disclosed herein can achieve
 8  an array of cell blocks.
 9  [0091]      In accordance with another aspect of the subject matter, the apparatus and system
 '0 disclosed herein can be configured as a kit, or collection of discrete components designed to
  1 function as a unit. The kit includes a needle, such as but not limited to a fine aspiration needle,
 2  and a cell block apparatus described above. In some embodiments, the elongate tubular member
 3  is preloaded with a fixative.     The kit may include a second, replaceable, filter assembly.
 4  Referring to FIG.6, the second filter assembly 220 may include a base member 224 and a filter
 5  membrane 222 having a planar bottom surface and wall upwardly extending from the planar
 6  bottom surface of the filter membrane.        The upwardly extending wall can include one or a
 '7 plurality of bellows 229 or plurality of threads. In another embodiment, a kit is provided which
 '8 provides one or more filter assemblies for samples that are not associated with a large quantity of
 9  liquid or blood. Tissue sealed in the filter assembly can then be placed in a container of formalin
10  for clinicians performing FNAs or biopsies. In such instances, for example, the specimen does
11  not need to be centrifuged in a tubular structure.      Instead, it can be embedded in the filter
12  assembly and undergo histology directly.
13  [0092]      In yet another embodiment, as illustrated in FIGS. 8A and 8B, a filter assembly 120 is
14  provided (as described above), which includes a compressive cover 400.            As illustrated in
15  FIG.8A the filter assembly 120 can include a tissue sample 310. The compressive cover 400 is
16  disposed within the filter assembly 120 and is able to close the filter assembly so that the

  7 contents are enclosed in a sealed manner.           In this regard, the compressive cover can be
  8 configured with a planar top surface 410 that serves as a cap.          The compressive cover 400
  9 includes a planar bottom surface and a sidewall 412. As illustrated, the sidewall 412 can include
  0 a plurality of bellows 430, which can contract and expand. When in a contracted state (shown in
  1 FIG.8B), a compressive force is exerted on the sample 310 contained within the filter assembly
 '2 120. Additionally or alternatively to the structural features described above which facilitate the
 '3 generation of compressive forces, the cover can be formed of elastomeric material with innate
 '4 compressive and expansive properties to enhance the compressive force exerted on the collected
 .5 sample and filter membrane.       The application of pressure to the sample 310 concentrates and
 '6 constrains the sample. Additionally, the compressive cover facilitates an even distribution of
 '7 cells and also helps the paraffin to penetrate the sample 310 to provide improved embedding of
 '8 the cells of the tissue sample.     Further, the compressive cover 400 serves to close the filter
 '9 assembly from the external environment, thereby preserving the integrity of the collected tissue
  0 sample.
  1 [0093]      The compressive cover can have a planar surface formed from the same filter
  2 membrane material as that on the filter assembly.           For example, in one embodiment, the
.3  compressive cover is lined by a filter membrane, which can be similar in pore size, thickness and
34  density as the filter membrane 122 of the filter assembly 120.             In another example, the
35  compressive cover has a planar surface having a porosity of between about 0.4 pm to about 10.0
36  pim. Although an exemplary range is provided for illustrative purposes, it will be understood by
37  one of ordinary skill in the art that alternative sizes are within the scope of the disclosed subject
38  matter. The use of a compressive cover is advantageous in that it eliminates the need for more

 0  condense the tissue, remove excess liquid, and contain all cells.
 .1 [0094]      Although FIGS. 8A-B depict generally circular compressive covers, alternative
 .2 geometries such as a bowl shape (FIGS. 8C) or elliptical-disc shape (FIG.8D) can be employed if
 .3 so desired. Similarly, alternative embodiments can include covers with non-planar bottom or top
 .4 surfaces such that the cover can impart a pattern or non-uniform distribution of the collected
 .5 sample, as well as covers having different diameters than the filter membrane. Also, the covers
 *6 can include a retention mechanism (e.g., latch, tongue-groove coupling, etc.) for engagement
 -7 with a corresponding structure on the filter assembly to lock or retain the sample on the filter
 -8 membrane.      Such an enclosure is advantageous in preventing debris from contaminating the
 -9 collected sample, as well as facilitating storage and/or transport of the collected sample, if so
 .0 desired.
 .1 [0095]      The filter assembly 120 and compressive cover 400 together, for example, can be
 .2 used for non-FNA specimens, such as biopsies.           For example, the specimen can be placed
 .3 directly in the filter assembly at the time the clinician removes the tissue from the patient (rather
 .4 than placing loose piece(s) of tissue in jar of formalin to be handled by pathology laboratory
55  personnel thereafter).    Such application is advantageous in that it: (1) eliminates the chance of
56  cross contamination which is possible with transferring and handling tissue multiple times; (2)
57  eliminates the loss of minute pieces of tissue with multiple transfers; and (3) prevents leaving a
58  specimen behind in a formalin jar, for example, because the specimen was inadvertently
59  undetected.    Typically, tissue samples are transferred from different media and/or containers
60  several times before being ready for cutting for microscopic examination. The filter assembly
61  and compressive cover disclosed herein serve to overcome the disadvantages of such procedures.

  6 exemplary embodiments disclosed below, it is within the scope of the disclosed subject matter to
  7 include a cover and base member with the filter membrane, if so desired. In this exemplary
  8 embodiment of FIGS. 9A-B, the filter membrane 522 is clamped between the two tubular
  9 portions 510a and 510b to capture particulates while liquid passes from 510a to 510b during
  0 centrifuging. The lower tubular member 51Ob can be configured with a lip or recess proximate
  1 on its upper end to receive the filter membrane 522 therein. Alternatively, the upper tubular
  2 member 510a can be configured with a support member, such as shelf or flange (described in
 '3 further detail below), which receives the filter membrane 522 therein.           Locating the filter
 '4 membrane at the midpoint of the tubular body is advantageous in that such a configuration
 '5 results in the reservoir disposed above the filter membrane to be of equivalent size as the
 '6 reservoir below the filter membrane, and therefore equivalent amounts of fluid can be contained
 '7 within each reservoir. However, the filter membrane can be disposed at alternative locations
 '8 closer to the top or bottom of either tubular portion 510a, 510b is within the scope of the
79  disclosed subject matter.
80  [0097]      The elongate tubular pieces 51 Oa, 51Ob can be attached, e.g., by via an interference fit
81  or a threaded engagement between the respective inner and outer sidewalls. Although the
82  exemplary embodiment depicted in FIGS. 9A-B depict the upper tubular member 510a as the
83  male component and the lower tubular member 510B as the female component, these
84  configurations can be reversed, as so desired. Additionally, or alternatively, the tubular members
                                                     22

  5 can be formed with an equivalent inner and outer diameters, and coupled by any suitable device,
  6 e.g., magnets.
  7 [0098]       In another exemplary embodiment, the tube pieces 510a, 51Ob can be configured such
  8 that one of the pieces is received, at least partially, in a telescoping manner within the other as
  9 shown in FIG.9C. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG.9C, the upper tube 510a can have a
 '0 bottom portion with a platform for the filter assembly that would fit at 522' and a circumscribing
 '1 shelf or lip 512a configured to rest against an inwardly protruding lip or shelf 512b formed in the
 '2 lower tube portion 510b. Additionally or alternatively, the inwardly protruding shelf 512a can
 '3 also receive the filter membrane. Further, the dimensions of the protruding shelves 512a, 512b
 '4 can vary both in terms of the cross-sectional thickness as well as the distance the lips radially
 '5 protrude so as to accommodate filter membranes of varying sizes. The elongate tubular pieces
 '6 51 Oa, 51Ob can be attached via an interference fit, a threaded engagement between the respective
 '7 inner and outer sidewalls, or via mating engagement between shelves 512a and 512b.
 '8 [0099]       In some embodiments comprising two elongate tubular members, the inner tubular
 '9 member 51 Oa can be formed with a slot or channel formed in the sidewall which extends along
  0 the longitudinal axis of the tubular member, as shown in FIG.9D. This slot is sized to receive the
01  filter membrane and allows for rapid removal of the filter membrane after the centrifuge process,
02  without the need to disassemble the two elongate tubular members. Although the exemplary
03  embodiment of FIG.9D depicts vertical slots, alternative designs (such as a staggered or tortious
04  path) are within the scope of the disclosed subject matter. Such tortious path designs can be
05  advantageous in requiring deliberate and careful removal of the filter membrane, thereby
06  preventing accidental removal or dislodgment of the filter membrane after the centrifuging
07  process.

 '8 [00100]      As previously described above with respect to FIGS. 8A-D, some embodiments of the
 9  disclosed subject matter can employ a compressive cover or cap to facilitate the concentration
 0  and isolation of the collected sample on the filter membrane. For example, the filter membrane
  1 522 of FIG.1OA can be configured to receive a cover 600 which matingly engages the filter
 2  membrane 522 as shown in FIGS. 1OB-D. As indicated by the arrows depicted in FIG. OD, the
 3  cover 600 can apply a compressive force to concentrate and constrain the particulate for
 4  subsequent steps, such as dehydration, clearing, infiltration, etc. The compressive force exerted
 5  by the cover 600 can be supplied by the technician or by an external device (not shown) such as
 6  a spring-loaded plunger.
 7  [00101]      In accordance with an aspect of the presently disclosed subject matter, the filter
  8 membrane 522 includes alignment features illustrated in the exemplary embodiment as Roman
 9  numeral indicia, as shown in FIGS. 11 B-C. These indicia allow users to easily and precisely
 '0 reference a specific region of interest (e.g., location "III", or the "three-o'clock position").
  1 Additionally, the indicia allow for different slices of the filter membrane to be oriented as so
 2  desired with respect to each other, as well as evidencing whether the filter membrane 522 is
 3  flipped or inverted. The filter membrane 522 can be formed with alternating peaks 522a and
24  valleys 522b around its circumference, as shown in FIG. 11 A, to increase the surface area and
25  provide greater stability and reliability during both the centrifuge step as well as the subsequent
26  sectioning (i.e. cutting). In addition to this indicia, the border (or frame) of the filter membrane
27  can be formed with a greater thickness than the porous filter portion, and serve as a gasket which
28  forms a seal with the interior surface of the tubular body. Further, this border portion can be
29  formed of opaque material which further serves as a visual aid to easily identify particular areas
30  of interest in the sample collected on the inner porous material. Furthermore, this border portion
                                                      24

  1 of the filter membrane can be formed of a porous material, e.g. open cell foam or foam rubber,
 2  which allows the cutting blade to easily slice through the filter membrane without excessive
 3  force, thereby eliminating any undesired buckling of the filter membrane, damage to the blade,
 4  or splintering or flaking of the filter membrane. Additionally, the filter membrane can be formed
 5  separately from the remainder of the filter assembly (e.g., the porous filter membrane which
 6  serves to separate the tissue(s), or cell block, from the collected sample of fluid/tissue can be
 7  distinct from the surrounding frame having the undulating structure and indicia as shown in
 8  FIG. 1OA). The porous filter membrane can be attached to the surrounding structure via adhesive
 9  or ultrasonic welding.
 -0 [00102]      In further regards to the structure of the filter membrane (or assembly, if present), and
 .1 as disclosed above, the increase in surface area provided by the peaks and valleys formed in the
 .2 periphery of the filter membrane (or assembly, if present) facilitates integration with the
 -3 embedding medium (e.g., wax) and improved anchoring of the filter membrane. The number of
 -4 peaks and valleys can be varied as so desired, and in some embodiments the peaks and valleys
 -5 are configured as obtuse rounded edges (FIGS. 1OA-D), whereas in other embodiments the peaks
 -6 and valleys are formed as acute apices (FIGS. 10E-F). Additionally or alternatively, the filter
47  membrane 522 (or assembly, if present) can be formed recesses 532, as illustrated in FIGS. 1OF
48  G, which similarly increase the surface area for engagement of the filter membrane with the
49  embedding medium. In other embodiments the filter membrane can be formed with surface
50  features, such as cylindrical posts 530 (FIG. 1OE) or ribs 534 (FIG. 1OG) which also increase the
51  surface area for engagement with the embedding medium.              Additionally or alternatively, as
52  illustrated in FIG. 1OH, the filter membrane can be formed as a porous member, e.g. foam, which
53  permits the embedding medium to penetrate through and infiltrate the entire filter membrane
                                                        25

 .4 and/or assembly. In each of these embodiments, the enhanced engagement and integration of the
 .5 filter membrane with the wax results in a more reliable and consistent sectioning. Moreover, the
 6  various structural features described above (e.g. peaks/valleys, holes, ribs, porous foam) for
 7  increasing the surface area of the filter membrane also allow for a user to selectively orient the
 8  filter membrane during assembly, sectioning, and/or placing in a diagnostic apparatus (e.g.
 9  microscope).
 0  [00103]      Although the particular exemplary embodiments of the filter membrane shown in
  1 FIGS. 10-1iC depict a generally circular filter membrane formed of a semi-rigid material,
 2  alternative configurations of filter membrane geometries and construction are within the scope of
 3  the disclosed subject matter. For example, the filter membrane can be configured as a flexible
 4  bag-like member, as shown in FIG. 1 ID. The bag-like filter membrane is made with a desired
 5  porosity, as described above, and provides an amorphous shape which allows the membrane to
 6  distort as needed under the forces generated during the centrifuge process, which can relieve
 7  some of the stresses that may be imparted on the other components of the apparatus when a rigid
 8  filter membrane is employed. Additionally, such a flexible bag-like filter embodiment allows for
 9  greater design flexibility in that the amorphous filter can accommodate differing volumes of
/0  cells.    Furthermore, the amorphous bag-like structure effectively increases the surface area
71  through which the biological sample passes, which in turn expedites the filtration process and
72  minimizes the risk of clogging the filter membrane in applications of cellular specimens. The
73  exemplary embodiment depicted in FIG.1ID illustrates a filter membrane which also includes
74  structural reinforcement features, described in further detail below.
75  [00104]      In an alternative embodiment, a singular elongate tubular body 610 can include
76  sealing plungers 612 and 614 disposed therein, and a filter membrane 622 disposed between he
                                                     26

  7 plungers, as depicted in FIG.12A-B. The plungers support the filter membrane 622 at a location
  8 suspended between the ends of the tubular body 610, e.g., at a midpoint of the tubular body 610,
  9 and have a radial flange circumscribing the plunger which seals off an upper and lower reservoir
 .0 within the tubular body 610.       This seal prohibits fluid transfer between reservoirs during
  1 centrifugation, thereby forcing all liquid to pass through the filter membrane 622. As described
 .2 above, locating the filter membrane at the midpoint of the tubular body is advantageous in that it
 .3 provides reservoirs of equivalent size and amounts of fluid contained therein.       However, the
 '4 plungers 612, 614 can be sized as so desired to position the filter membrane at any point along
  5 the tubular body 610.
 .6 [00105]     In some embodiments the filter membrane can include structural reinforcement
  7 features.  In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 13A, a bowl-like filter membrane 622
 .8 (shown in cross-sectional view) includes radially outwardly extending protrusions or shelves
 .9 622a that are sized to engage a corresponding shelf or lip in the elongate tube 610 which receives
  0 the filter membrane, as shown in FIG. 13B. These radially outwardly extending protrusions or
  1 shelves 622a strengthen the sidewalls of the filter membrane and absorb some of the forces
  2 generated during the centrifuge process. In some embodiments, the shelves 612b of the elongate
93  tube member 610 are contoured to engage the filter membrane shelves 622a over a greater
94  surface area (e.g., the sidewalls of the bowl-like filter membrane) as shown in FIG.13C. This
95  increased area of engagement between the filter membrane and the elongate tubular member
96  provides additional support to the filter membrane during centrifuge process. Furthermore, the
97  structural reinforcement features 622a and 612b allow for the filter membrane to be securely
98  positioned within a single piece elongate tubular member 610. This can be advantageous in that
                                                      27

 9  it reduces the total number of parts as well as the assembly/disassembly steps required to carry
 '0 out the method of the disclosed subject matter.
  1 [00106]     Additionally or alternatively, the structural reinforcement features can include struts
 2  622b disposed at the bottom of the filter membrane which extend across the length, e.g.,
 3  diameter, of the filter membrane 622, as shown in FIG. 13D. These struts 622b prevent the filter
 4  membrane from warping or breaking when exposed to forces associated with the centrifuge
 5  process. These structural reinforcement features disclosed herein can be formed integrally with
 6  the filter membrane, or alternatively formed as a separate insert that is positioned below the filter
 7  membrane.
  8 [00107]     Additionally, a handle (not shown) can be incorporated into the filter membrane
 9  which extends above the opening of the elongate tube member to allow the membrane to be
 0  easily removed.    In this regard, the operator grasps the handle at a location which is spaced
  1 above the collected cell sample, thereby eliminating any risk of contamination or accidental loss
 2  of the sample. In some embodiments, the handle can extend radially outward through a slot
 3  formed in the tubular body, as described above and shown in FIG.9D.
 4  [00108]     In an alternative exemplary embodiment, a sample loading chamber 702 and filter
15  membrane 722 are disposed on a support post 704 and housed within a unitary elongate tubular
16  body 710, as shown in FIGS. 14A-C.           The support post 704 is disposed below the filter
17  membrane and extends longitudinally to position the filter membrane 722 at a location
18  suspended between the ends of the tube 710, e.g., at a midpoint of the tube 710. The filter
19  membrane 722 can include a radially extending border portion, e.g., flange, which seals off an
20  upper and lower reservoir within the elongate tubular member 710. This seal prohibits fluid
21  transfer between reservoirs during centrifugation, thereby forcing all material to pass through the

 2  filter membrane. As described above, locating the filter membrane at the midpoint of the tube is
 3  advantageous in that such a configuration results in equivalent size reservoirs.          However,
 4  alternative locations of the filter membrane are within the scope of the disclosed subject matter.
 5  [00109]     The support post 704 can include longitudinally extending slots or channels 705.
 6  These slots serve as passageways which allow for the liquid disposed below the filter membrane
 '7 to freely move around within the lower reservoir formed during the centrifuge process to avoid
 '8 localized pockets or cells of concentrated liquid. Additionally or alternatively, the slots can be
 9  configured as discontinuous local openings, e.g., circular apertures. An additional advantage of
 0  the embodiment depicted in FIGS. 14A-C is that it can be readily configured to fit existing
  1 centrifuge tubes, thus avoiding expensive or complex retrofit operations.          In addition for
 2  allowing for passage of fluid, the slot 705 allows for deflection of the support post 704 to
 3  compensate and adjust for variances in length (e.g. due to manufacturing tolerances) of the
 4  various pieces upon assembly of the apparatus. That is, the components 702, 722, and 704 are
 5  positioned inside the tube 710 and compressed when the cap is attached at the top of the tube.
 6  The slot 705 provides a spring action which can bend to allow the filter membrane/assembly to
 7  be compressed for a range of height variations.
38  [00110]     In accordance with another aspect of the disclosed subject matter, the systems
39  disclosed herein allow for an improved FNA processing protocol which reduces the number of
40  steps of the presently disclosed subject matter (denoted by reference numeral 20) as compared to
41  traditional prior art techniques (denoted by reference numeral 10), as shown in FIG. 15.
42  [00111]     From a pathology perspective, physicians are typically interested in examining the
43  cells collected by the filter membrane, whereas from a diagnostic, biochemical, and molecular
44  perspective, physicians are typically interested in examining the liquid or "supernatant" which

 5  passes through filter membrane.      Consequently, in some scenarios both portions of the sample
 6  (i.e. cell and supernatant) are retained and need to be sent to two different laboratories. Thus,
 7  and in accordance with another aspect of the disclosed subject matter, the filter membrane with
 *8 the collected cell sample can be removed, while the supernatant is secured within the tube for
 9  parallel processing.     In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG.16, after a centrifuge
 o  process is performed the sample cell is retained by filter membrane (not shown) to rest on
 1  shelves 812, and the fluid or supernatant is contained within lower tubular member 8 1Ob.
 2  [00112]      A first cap 830a is provided to engage with the top of either the elongate tubular
 3  member 81 Oa (for scenarios in which it is desirable to remove the filter membrane and collected
 4  cell sample while packaging the fluid supernatant in the two tubes 810a, 810b together), or
 5  elongate tubular member 810b (for scenarios in which it is desirable to remove the filter
 6  membrane and collected cell sample while packaging the fluid supernatant in tube 810b alone).
 7  A second cap 830b is provided to engage with the bottom of elongate tubular member 810b. In
 8  some embodiments the second cap 830b is hingedly attached to the tubular member 810b and
 9  allowed to pivot between open and closed positions. This allows for rapid removal of the fluid in
 0  a controlled manner that is not obstructed by the filter assembly above.
61  [00113]      The first cap 830a can be configured with both internal and external threads such that
62  a single cap can be employed with a plurality of tube sizes (i.e., male engagement with smaller
63  diameter tubes, and a female engagement with larger diameter tubes). It is to be understood that
64  the disclosed cap arrangements can be employed on any of the disclosed tubular configurations
65  (e.g., one piece, two-piece, telescopingly received, etc.) and for any desired size. Furthermore,
66  in some embodiments, prior to use of the apparatus, the components of the disclosed subject

 6  body 910b. The filter membrane is inserted within the first (or inner) elongate tubular body 910a
 7  and includes structural reinforcement members in the form of an outwardly protruding shelf to be
 8  received by corresponding inwardly protruding shelf of the first (or inner) elongate tubular body
 9  910a.     As described above, the first elongate tubular body 910a can include longitudinally

 5  for commencement of a filtration process. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 18, the closing
 '6 mechanism 1014 includes slots for receiving in a snap-fit engagement the locking mechanism
 7  1016. Upon completion of the filtration process, a user can squeeze the downwardly extending
08  tabs of the elongate tubular body 1010 to cause deflection and release of the locking mechanism
09  1016 from the slots within the closing mechanism 1014.
10  [00116]     In yet another embodiment, an alternative geometry is provided which employs cross
11  flow filtration which increases the filtration surface area and thereby reduces the overall cycle
12  time required for a desired amount of filtration, as well as minimizes clogging. The structure
13  depicted in FIG. 19A-B includes a elongate tubular body 1110 and underlying support member
                                                     32

  4 1704 which can be configured for assembly and placement within a second elongate tubular
  5 body (not shown).      Also, the support member 1704 includes a slot or channel 1705, which
  6 functions similarly to the slot 705 disclosed above with respect to FIGS. 14A-C.            The filter
  7 membrane 1120 (or assembly, if configured as discrete components) includes two filtration
  8 surfaces, i.e. upper surface 1122 and lower surface 1123 (see FIG. 20A).        The upper filtration
  9 surface 1122 is sized such that it is received within the housing or border portion 1124. The
 '0 lower filtration surface 1123 is sized such that it has an equivalent outer diameter as the housing
 11 1124.
 '2 [00117]     The elongate tubular body 1110 has an internal taper resulting in a reduced diameter
 '3 (relative to the proximal opening or mouth) outlet 1112 which extends into the filtration space
 '4 defined between the upper and lower surfaces of the filter membrane 1120. The outlet includes a
 '5 non-planar surface 1113 at the opening, such as a notch or recess. Accordingly, only a portion of
 '6 the outlet 1112 engages the lower filtration surface 1120, when assembled, resulting in a lateral
 '7 port or recess which presents a path of least resistance for exiting fluid. Consequently, as fluid
 '8 exits the outlet, the non-uniform surface at the outlet 1113 imparts a force on the exiting fluid
 '9 which directs a portion of the flow in a transverse or tangential direction, across the filter surface
.0  (as indicated by the arrows in FIG. 19B). The elongate tubular body 110, and/or the underlying
31  support member 1704, also include a side port 1114 which allows fluid to exit the apparatus and
32  enter the main centrifuge tube (not shown).
33  [00118]     In accordance with another aspect of the disclosed subject matter, and as an
34  alternative to conventional centrifuging processes, the filtration force employed in concert with
35  the apparatus disclosed herein can be provided by a suction force. For purposes of illustration
36  and not limitation, FIGS. 21-22 illustrate some embodiments wherein the driving force is

 8  member 722 (as previously disclosed with respect to FIGS. 14A-C) can be configured with a
 9  tapered opening to sealingly couple with an external syringe 2000. The user can then pull back
 0  on the syringe plunger to draw the fluid from the elongate tubular body 702, through the filter
 .1 membrane 722 and into the barrel of the syringe.       Similarly, and as depicted in FIG. 22, an
 .2 external vacuum source can be coupled to the support member 704 and activated to draw the
 3  fluid from the elongate tubular body 702, through the filter membrane 722 and into a receptacle
 .4 or reservoir 2001 of the vacuum.
 5  [00119]      In one exemplary embodiment, the apparatus is configured as a cell block apparatus
 *6 2300 as shown schematically in FIG. 23A-B. Cell block apparatus 2300 includes an elongate
 7  tubular body 2310 and a sample loading chamber 2320. The elongate tubular body 2310 has a
 *8 proximal end 2312 and a distal end 2314. In some embodiments, the elongate tubular body 2310
 9  has a first diameter (di) at the proximal end and a second diameter (d2) at the distal end, wherein
 0  the second diameter is smaller than the first diameter. A section 2318 disposed between the
  1 proximal end 2312 and the distal end 2314 of the elongate tubular body 2310, has a decreasing
 2  diameter along a length thereof to define a generally conical distal section of the elongate tubular
33  member 2310. In some embodiments, a less gradual taper can be provided such that the elongate
54  tubular body includes a step or abrupt restriction in diameter at 2318.           A cover 2330 is
55  detachably disposed at the proximal end of elongate tubular body 2310. A filter membrane (or
56  filtration insert) 2340 (which can be the filter membrane alone, or an assembly as described
57  above, e.g. in Figs. 4-8 and 10-11) is disposed on the sample loading chamber 2320 within the
58  elongate tubular body 2310. Various suitable volumes are available for elongate tubular body
59  2310. For purpose of illustration and not limitation, suitable volumes include between about 15

 0 ml to about 50 ml, or any other size that fits into a centrifuge, standard or otherwise. Various
 1 suitable volumes are available for sample loading chamber 2320. For purpose of illustration and
 2 not limitation, suitable volumes include between about 15 ml to about 50 ml, or any other size
 3 that fits into elongate tubular body 2310. However, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill
 4 in the art that alternative sizes are within the scope of the disclosed subject matter. The elongate
 5 tubular body is sized to fit within a conventional centrifuge.       In this manner, the cell block
 6 apparatus can receive the biological sample, for example, from a needle housing the biological
 7 sample obtained by fine needle aspiration techniques, and be disposed in the centrifuge for
 8 separation of the cells in the biological sample from any liquid to isolate and consolidate the cells
 9 into a concentrated pellet by centrifugation. Using the same unit for receiving the biological
 0 sample and separating the biological sample into component parts reduces the loss of sample size
 1 and reduces risk of contamination due to exchange between multiple components.              In some
 2 embodiments, the elongate tubular body is suitable for relative centrifugal forces of between
 3 about 1,200 to about 16,000 RCF. For example, 12,000 RCF, 1,200 RCF, 16,000 RCF, 2,000
 4 RCF, 9,400 RCF, 7,500 RCF. For further illustration in one embodiment, the elongate tubular
 5 member has a volume of 15 ml, and is suitable for centrifugation at 1,200 RCF or 12,000 RCF.
 6 In other embodiments, for example, the elongate tubular member has a volume of 50 ml and is
77 suitable for centrifugation at 16,000 RCF or 2,000 RCF or 9,400 RCF. The elongate tubular
78 body of the device can be formed of various materials and in particular various polymers, for
79 example, polypropylene and/or polystyrene. Further, the materials used for the elongate tubular
80 body, sample loading chamber, or cover, can be biodegradable materials.
81 [00120]      In one exemplary embodiment, and as depicted in FIG. 24A-B, a sample loading
82 chamber 2320 is designed to be inserted within elongate tubular body 2310. The sample loading

 '3 chamber 2320 includes a proximal or top end having a structural retention feature 2412, (e.g.,
 .4 flange or ledge) configured to engage the top of the elongate tubular body 2310 upon insertion
 .5 therein. The structural retention feature 2412 can extend so as to curl or overlay a lip formed in
 .6 the elongate tubular body 2310 to provide a more secure union. At a distal or bottom end of the
 .7 sample loading chamber 2320, a closing mechanism (e.g., cap) 2414 is hingedly attached at 2415
 .8 (e.g. by a living hinge) to the sample loading chamber 2320.            Accordingly, the closing
 .9 mechanism 2414 can pivot between open (as depicted in FIG. 24B) and closed (FIG. 24A)
 0  positions. A filter membrane 2340 (not shown) can be positioned at the distal end 2413 of the
  1 sample loading chamber 2320 and securely retained in this position by rotating the closing
 2  mechanism 2414 from the open (as depicted in FIG. 24B) to closed (as depicted in FIG. 24A)
 3  positions. A locking mechanism (e.g., protrusion) 2416 can be included on the distal end of the
 4  sample loading chamber 2320 in order to secure the closing mechanism 2414 in the closed
 5  position and retain the filtration membrane 2340 for commencement of a filtration process. In
 6  the embodiment depicted in FIG. 24A-B, the closing mechanism 2414 includes slots for
 7  receiving in a snap-fit engagement the locking mechanism 2416. In alternative embodiments
 8  (not pictured), closing mechanism 2414 is not attached to sample loading chamber 2320, but may
 9  be opened and closed by disengaging and engaging locking mechanism 2416. Upon completion
00  of the filtration process, a user can squeeze the downwardly extending tabs of the sample loading
01  chamber 2320 to cause deflection and release of the locking mechanism 2416 from the slots
02  within the closing mechanism 2414.
03  [00121]      In accordance with an aspect of the presently disclosed subject matter, the filtration
04  membrane 2340, can be formed with alternating peaks and valleys around its circumference, as
05  shown in FIG. 25, to increase the surface area and provide greater stability and reliability during

 9  2320. Further, this border portion can be formed of opaque material which further serves as a
 0  visual aid to easily identify particular areas of interest in the sample collected on the inner porous
  1 material.   Furthermore, this border portion of the filter membrane can be formed of a porous
 2  material, e.g. open cell foam or foam rubber, which allows the cutting blade to easily slice
 3  through the filter membrane without excessive force, thereby eliminating any undesired buckling
 4  of the filter membrane, damage to the blade, or splintering or flaking of the filter membrane.
 5  Additionally, the filter membrane can be formed separately from the remainder of the filter
 6  assembly (e.g., the porous filter membrane which serves to separate the tissue(s), or cell block,
 7  from the collected sample of fluid/tissue can be distinct from the surrounding frame having the
  8 undulating structure and indicia as shown in FIG. 10A).           The porous filter membrane can be
 9  attached to the surrounding structure via adhesive or ultrasonic welding.

22  substantially rectilinear, having a hinged top surface, a fixed bottom surface, and four
23  perpendicular sides. The top and bottom surfaces are perforated by a series of regularly spaces
24  slots to form a grating. The top surface is affixed to one side of the container by a hinge. The
25  side opposite the hinge is inclined towards the center line of the container so as to allow access to
26  a tab disposed on the edge of the top surface opposite the hinge. Containers 2600 are used for
27  storage of filter membranes 2340. The grating in container 2600 allows the passage of air, water,
28  or clearing solutions in order to clean filter membrane 2340.

  3 2950 which is in turn attached to the distal end of the sample loading chamber 2920 (see FIG.
 '4 30B). This subassembly is then disposed within the elongate tubular body 2910 and ready to
 '5 receive a biological sample at the proximal end (see FIG. 30C).         The clamp 2950 can be
 '6 configured with a planar bottom surface having at least one aperture 2953 therein for allowing
 '7 liquid to easily pass through during the centrifuge process. As best shown in FIG. 29, the clamp
 '8 2950 also includes two sidewalls 2952, 2954 extending upwardly from the planar bottom
 9  surface.   As noted above, the sidewalls include fastening features (e.g. threads, protrusions,
  0 recesses, etc.) on the interior surface which are configured to releasably engage the fastening
  1 features on the exterior surface of the distal portion 2924 of the sample loading chamber. The
  2 sidewalls are configured with an arcuate shape having a radius of curvature that coincides with
  3 the contour of the sample loading chamber 2920. A recess or opening is disposed between the
  4 two sidewalls 2952, 2954 which allows for easy access to the filtration insert 2940 to facilitate
  5 insertion and removal of the filter membrane 2940 with respect to the clamp 2950.
36  [00131]     Referring again to the clamp member 2950, as previously described with respect to
37  FIGS. 29-30C, the two arcuate sidewalls 2952, 2954 include fastening features to engage
38  complementary fastening features on the sample loading chamber 2920.           In the exemplary
39  embodiment of FIGS. 37-38, the filter membrane 2940 is positioned within the clamp 2950 via
40  the finger access slots or openings between sidewalls 2952, 2954. Thereafter, the clamp is
41  securely coupled to the sample loading chamber 2920 via a threaded engagement by twisting or
42  screwing the clamp 2950 in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.          In the exemplary
                                                       42

 3  embodiment of FIG. 38, the clamp is securely coupled to the loading chamber 2920 via a ratchet
 .4 engagement (i.e. a combination of rotation and translational movement).        In other words, the
 5  operator pushes the clamp upwards or towards the sample loading chamber 2920 while
 *6 simultaneously twisting the clamp 2950 in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. In the
 7  alternative embodiment of FIGS. 39A-B, the sidewalls 3952, 3954 include downwardly
 *8 extending tabs, which upon completion of the filtration process, an operator can squeeze to cause
 9  deflection (FIG. 39A) and release of the filter membrane 2940 from the slots within the clamp
 o  2950.
  1 [00132]      FIGS. 31A-D depict the various stages of the filtration process. After assembly of the
 2  filtration device (FIGS. 30C and 3 1A) a biological sample is deposited within the sample loading
 3  chamber 2920 (FIG. 31B) and cover 2930 is placed on elongate tubular body 2910 (FIG. 31C).
 4  After spinning in a centrifuge, a liquid portion of the biological sample collects in the distal end
 5  of the elongate tubular body 2910 while the cells are collected in the filter membrane 2940 (FIG.
 6  31D).
 .7 [00133]      In accordance with an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, containers 3200 are
 .8 adapted to contain filter membrane 2940 (and post-filtration cap 2960, if present) as depicted in
59  FIG. 32. These containers 3200 are advantageous in that they serve as a convenient and secure
60  storage mechanism for retaining the filter membrane 2940, which contains the captured cells,
61  and facilitates additional processing of filtration insert 2940 (and captured cells).         In the
62  embodiment depicted in FIGS. 32-34, containers 3200 are substantially rectilinear, having top
63  surface 3210 and a bottom surface 3220 which includes four perpendicular sides. The top and
64  bottom surfaces are perforated by a series of regularly spaces slots to form a grating. The top
65  surface is affixed to one side of the container by a hinge. The side opposite the hinge is inclined
                                                     43

 6  towards the center line of the container so as to allow access to a tab disposed on the edge of the
 7  top surface opposite the hinge. The top surface 3210 can be removably attached to the bottom
 8  surface 3220, or permanently attached, e.g., via a living-hinge, as so desired. Alternatively, the
 9  top surface 3210 can be attached to the bottom surface 3220 via a tongue and groove coupling
 0  such that the top surface translates or slides in a linear fashion with respect to the bottom surface
  1 3220 to open and close the container 3200. The grating in container 3200 allows the passage of
 2  air, water, or clearing solutions in order to clean filter membrane 2940.
 3  [00134]      As shown in FIGS 33A-D, after the centrifuge process the cells are collected within
 4  the filter membrane 2940 and a post-filtration cap 2960 can be inserted within filter membrane
 5  2940 (FIG. 33A). The filter membrane 2940 and cap 2960 are then inserted within container
 6  3200 (FIG. 33B) and the top surface 3210 is pivoted to close the containers 3200 (FIG. 33C-D).
 '7 The cavity within the container 3200 can be sized such that the top surface 3210 compresses the
 '8 filtration insert 2940 and cap 2960 upon closure of the container 3200. This serves to further
 '9 constrain and compact the cells collected within filter membrane 2940, as shown in FIG. 34.
 0  [00135]      In accordance with another aspect of the disclosed subject matter, a mold 3500 is
  1 provided for embedding the filter membrane 2940 for additional processing, as shown in FIG.
82  35A. In operation, the filter membrane 2940 is removed from the container 3200 (as shown in
83  FIGS. 33A-D) and positioned within the mold 3500. Similar to the container 3200, the mold
84  includes and top 3510 and bottom 3520 which can be sealingly engaged via hinge or tongue and
85  groove assembly. The bottom 3520 includes a recess or compartment 3522 for receiving
86  filtration insert 2940 (FIG. 35B). A liquid or wax (e.g. paraffin) is deposited within the mold
87  and surrounds the filter membrane 2940 within recess 3250 (FIG. 35C). Thereafter, the paraffin
88  encapsulated filter membrane 2940 is removed from the mold 3500. In the embodiment shown
                                                       44

  9 in FIG. 35D, the bottom 3520 is detached while the top 3510 is coupled to the encapsulated
 '0 filtration insert 2940. This can be advantageous in that the top 3510 can serve as a handle for an
  1 operator to manipulate and reposition the encapsulated filter membrane 2940 for sectioning (as
 '2 described below) without making direct contact the encapsulated filter membrane 2940, thereby
 '3 preserving the integrity of the collected cells.
 '4 [00136]      In accordance with another aspect of the disclosed subject matter, the encapsulated
 '5 filter membrane 2940 (which encompasses the collected cells "C" and cap 2960) can be
 '6 subjected to additional processing, such as the sectioning shown in FIGS. 36A-F.            The filter
 '7 membrane can be mounted to a device (not shown) for slicing or cutting into sections 2940' for
 '8 further examination (e.g. electron microscope) (FIG. 36C). This process can be continued until
 '9 the entire block of collected cells has been sectioned/sliced. Additionally, the filter membrane
  0 2940 is designed to indicate to the operator when the entirety of the cell block has been
  1 sectioned/sliced in that the operator will recognize the distinct color (or other suitable indicia) of
  2 the cap 2960 (as compared to the filtration insert 2940) as signaling that the complete cell block
  3 "C" has been traversed via the sectioning/slicing steps (FIG. 36D). The slices 2940' (which
  4 include the cells "C" and paraffin wax "W") are mounted on a slide 3600 for further inspection
05  (FIG. 36E). Furthermore, the slide can be heated to melt or dissolve the paraffin wax thereby
06  leaving only the cells on the slide for inspection (Fig. 36F).
07  [00137]      Similar to the previously described embodiments, a filter membrane 4440, can be
08  formed with an enlarged border (or frame) extending around its circumference to increase the
09  surface area and provide greater stability and reliability during both the centrifuge step as well as
10  the subsequent sectioning (i.e. cutting).     Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a filter
                                                      45

  1 membrane than can be sectioned or cut multiple times to provide multiple slices (and thus slides
  2 for microscopic viewing) from a single biological sample.
  3 [00138]     As shown in FIGS. 44-46 the border (or frame) of the filter membrane can be formed
  4 with a greater thickness than the porous filter portion (which is omitted in these figures for
  5 clarity sake of clarity). Further, this border portion can be formed of opaque material which
  6 further serves as a visual aid to easily identify particular areas of interest in the sample collected
  7 on the inner porous material. A wide variety of materials can be employed for constructing the
  8 porous filter and border of the filter membrane. For purpose of illustration and not limitation, the
  9 porous filter can be formed of a Polyethylene terephthalate or polycarbonate film, and the border
 '0 portion of the filter membrane can be formed of a machinable wax, as disclosed in U.S. Patent
  1 No. 4,518,288 (the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference).           The wax
 '2 allows the cutting blade to easily slice through the filter border without excessive force, thereby
 '3 eliminating any undesired buckling of the filter membrane, damage to the blade, or splintering or
 .4 flaking of the filter membrane (thus avoiding contaminating the sample collected). Additionally,
 '5 the border can be formed separately from the porous filter membrane which serves to separate
 '6 the tissue(s), or cell block, from the collected sample of fluid/tissue. In such embodiments the
27  porous filter membrane can be attached to the surrounding structure via adhesive, hot plate,
28  infrared, laser or ultrasonic welding. Alternatively, the border and porous filter membrane can
29  be integrally formed as a unitary component. Further, the border can be formed with a radially
30  inward projecting lip at the bottom (as best shown in FIG 46A and 5 1A). The porous membrane
31  can be coupled to the border along this lip.
32  [00139]     As shown in FIGS. 45-48, the border of the filter membrane is formed with an
33  upwardly extending sidewall that has a groove or slot 4442 formed therein. The cover 4460 is
                                                       46

 4  configured with a complementary flange 4462 which is configured to matingly engage the border
 ,5 slot 4442 (after collection of the biological sample) of the filter membrane to form a seal
 6  therebetween and securely retain the biological sample. As previously described, the increase in
 7  surface area provided by the undulating peaks and valleys formed in the periphery of the filter
 8  membrane facilitates integration with the embedding medium (e.g., wax) and improved
 9  anchoring of the filter membrane. The number of peaks and valleys can be varied as so desired,
 0  and in some embodiments the side portions are substantially flat (or planar) to increase
 .1 ergonomic appeal and facilitate handling of the filter membrane by technicians.
 .2 [00140]      The cover 4460 can be formed with a raised surface (e.g. hemispherical dome) 4466
 3  to permit and control the venting of any air retained within the filter membrane (and collected
 .4 sample) upon compression of the cover into the filter membrane border 4440. Additionally, the
 5  cover has a downwardly extending sidewall which can be formed with vertical ribs 4468 on a
 *6 radially inner surface to increase rigidity and facilitate uniform radial contraction.     In the
 7  embodiment shown in FIG 45 the cover sidewall extends downwardly a distance greater than the
 *8 elevation (relative to the sidewall) of the apex of the raised surface 4466 such that the apex is
 9  offset (below) the plane of the cover flange 4462.
50  [00141]      In some embodiments, as shown in FIGS. 47-48, the filter membrane 4740 can be
51  formed with a bottom surface that includes a plurality of apertures 4745 which serve as distinct
52  wells or chambers.      In use, a single biological sample would be dispensed within the filter
53  membrane (e.g. via centrifuging), with the cell block collected being divided into numerous
54  wells/chambers. This allows for multiple testing and analysis to be performed (e.g. at different
55  facilities, or at different times) based on the same biological sample.    While the exemplary
                                                     47

 6  embodiment illustrated depicts seven apertures, the number, size and positioning of the apertures
 7  can vary as so desired.
 8  [00142]      As shown in FIG. 48 the filter membrane includes a border with a groove 4742 for
 9  receiving a cover (not shown). Here, the cover can be formed with a flat or planar surface to
 0  facilitate compression of the collected sample thereby urging the sample into the respective filter
  1 membranes (not shown) positioned within each aperture 4745. Additionally or alternatively, the
 2  collected sample can be retained on the filter membrane 4740 by encapsulating the filter
 3  membrane 4440 with an encapsulation material (e.g. histogel).
 4  [00143]      In accordance with another aspect of the disclosed subject matter, a filter membrane
 5  is provided for collecting and forming a cell block from a biological sample without the use of a
 6  centrifuge process. As shown in FIGS. 49-5 1A, the filter membrane 4940 is provided with two
 7  porous filter meshes 4966, one which is substantially flush or coplanar with the top surface of the
  8 filter membrane border, and one which is substantially flush or coplanar with the bottom surface
 9  of the filter membrane border (as best shown in FIG. 5 1A). Alternatively, the porous filters can
 '0 be disposed adjacent to the border. In this regard the filter membrane 4940 serves as a single
  1 piece retentate chamber for the biological sample collected. The filter membrane border can be
72  formed with upper and lower lips which extend radially inward from the sidewall. Additionally,
73  a one-way valve (e.g. leaf spring vavle) 4970 is positioned on the interior surface of the border
74  sidewall, between the upper and lower lips. The one-way valve is biased in a closed position,
75  and is deflected into the open position when the pressure from outside the chamber (i.e. external
76  of the filter membrane 4940) exceeds the pressure within the chamber. In operation, a technician
77  can inject the biological sample via a delivery device (e.g. pump or syringe as shown in FIG. 50)
78  through an inlet port 4950 positioned in the sidewall of the filter membrane border. The pressure
                                                     48

  0 internal pressure, along with gravitational forces, draw the biological sample through the porous
  1 filter membranes 4966 leaving a cell block retentate within the chamber.
  2 [00144]     In accordance with another aspect of the disclosed subject matter, as depicted in
  3 FIGS. 52-54, a sample loading chamber 5220 is designed to be inserted within elongate tubular
  4 body 5210 (see FIG. 53).      The sample loading chamber 5220 includes a proximal or top end
  5 having a structural retention feature 5212, (e.g., flange or ledge) configured to engage the top of
  6 the elongate tubular body 5210 upon insertion therein. The structural retention feature 5212 can
  7 extend so as to curl or overlay a lip formed in the elongate tubular body 5210 to provide a more
  8 secure union.    The distal or bottom end 5224 of the sample loading chamber 5220 can be
  9 configured with a decreasing internal diameter and substantially constant external diameter such
 '0 that the loading chamber has an internal taper while retaining a generally cylindrical exterior.
 '1 The distal portion 5224 of the sample loading chamber can include a plurality of fastening
 '2 features (e.g. threads, protrusions, recesses, etc.) on the exterior for matingly engaging
 '3 complementary fastening features on the clamp 5250 (described in more detail below). Further,
 '4 the external diameter of distal portion 5224 can be less than the diameter of the remainder of
95  sample loading tube 5220, such that distal portion is recessed to allow the clamp 5250 to form a
96  flush (co-planar) fitting with the sample loading tube 5220, when assembled.
97  [00145]     The filter membrane 5240 is disposed within the clamp 5250 which is in turn attached
98  to the distal end of the sample loading chamber 5220 (see FIG. 53). This subassembly is then
99  disposed within the elongate tubular body 5210 and ready to receive a biological sample at the
00  proximal end. The clamp 5250 can be configured with a planar bottom surface having at least
01  one aperture 5253 therein for allowing liquid to easily pass through during the centrifuge
                                                      49

 12 process. As best shown in FIG. 29, the clamp 5250 also includes sidewalls extending upwardly
 3  from the planar bottom surface which include fastening features (e.g. threads, protrusions,
 4  recesses, etc.) on the interior surface which are configured to releasably engage the fastening
 '5 features on the exterior surface of the distal portion 5224 of the sample loading chamber. The
 '6 sidewalls are configured with an arcuate shape having a radius of curvature that coincides with
 '7 the contour of the sample loading chamber 5220.
 '8 [00146]     In the exemplary embodiment of FIGS. 52-54, the filter membrane 5240 is positioned
 '9 within the clamp 5250. Thereafter, the clamp is securely coupled to the sample loading chamber
 0  5220 via a threaded engagement by twisting or screwing the clamp 5250 in a clockwise or
  1 counterclockwise direction. In the exemplary embodiment, the clamp is securely coupled to the
 2  loading chamber 5220 via a ratchet engagement (i.e. a combination of rotation and translational
 3  movement).     In other words, the operator pushes the clamp upwards or towards the sample
 4  loading chamber 5220 while simultaneously twisting the clamp 5250 in a clockwise or
 5  counterclockwise direction.
 6  [00147]     The filter membrane 5240 is formed with a slot or groove 5242 (as described in
 7  further detail with respect to FIGS. 44-48) at the top of an upwardly extending sidewall. This
18  groove is configured to matingly receive the distal end of the sample loading chamber 5220 (as
19  best shown in FIG. 53B).
20  [00148]     Also included within the sample loading chamber 5220 is a valve stem 5260. The
21  valve stem 5260 is biased in the closed position (shown in Fig 52) which prevents fluid
22  communication between the sample loading chamber 5220 and the filter membrane 5240. As
23  shown in FIG. 53B, the distal end of the valve stem 5260 includes a bulbous portion having a
24  slot or groove 5262 for retaining a O-ring (not shown for sake of clarity). When in the closed
                                                     50

 '5 position, the bulbous end of the stem valve 5262 sealingly engages the tapered sidewalls of the
 '6 sample loading chamber 5220. This seal allows a biological sample to be deposited within the
 7  sample loading chamber, and for a centrifuging process(es) to be conducted, without any of the
 '8 sample escaping the sample loading chamber and passing through the filter membrane 5240.
 '9 Accordingly, the biological sample is separated or stratified (i.e. fluid content disposed above
 0  solid content) during the centrifuging process, and only released to communicate or pass through
  1 to the filter membrane upon opening of the stem valve 5260.
 2  [00149]      The stem valve 5260 is opened upon placement of a support cap 5230 onto the
 3  sample loading chamber 5220 (and external tube 5210). The downward force exerted by the cap
 4  5230 overcomes the bias of spring 5270 (see FIG. 53A) and allows the bulbous distal end 5262
 ,5 of the stem valve to move out of engagement with the tapered sidewalls of the sample loading
 6  chamber 5220. As shown in FIG. 53A, the spring 5270 has ends which engage the sidewalls of
 7  the sample loading chamber 5220, e.g. within the flange located at the mouth of the sample
  8 loading chamber.      Further, the spring 5270 (which can be a discrete component or integrally
 9  formed with the stem valve) extends through an aperture within the stem valve 5260 to effect
 -0 displacement thereof. Similarly, upon removal of the support cap 5230, the spring 5270 reverts
41  back to its biased position which moves the stem valve 5260 upward so that the bulbous distal
42  end 5262 of the stem valve returns into engagement with the tapered sidewalls of the sample
43  loading chamber 5220.
44  [00150]      In other embodiments, instead of the stem valve described above, a stop cock valve or
45  ball valve can be employed to retain the biological sample within the sample loading chamber
46  5220. Alternatively, a rotating disc valve 5560 can be employed wherein the valve can have an
47  open semicircle (i.e. aperture) 5560' and a solid semicircle, as shown in FIG. 55. The sample

 8  loading chamber 5520 can be formed with an internal taper which reduces the size of the opening
 -9 5520' at the distal end of the sample loading chamber. When in the closed position the solid
 .0 semicircle is aligned with the sample loading chamber interior lumen or aperture 5520', thereby
 .1 preventing fluid communication with the underlying filter membrane 5540. Upon rotation, the
 .2 disc valve aperture 5560' is brought into alignment with the sample loading chamber opening
 3  5520' such that the contents within the interior lumen or cavity are allowed to fluidly
 .4 communicate with the underlying filter membrane 5540. While the exemplary embodiment
 .5 depicts a circular valve having a single hemispherical aperture to permit fluid flow, it is to be
 .6 understood that alternative shapes, sizes and number of apertures can be provided as desired.
 .7 The greater the surface area in the sliding disc valve, the greater the impediment to flow through
 .8 the sample loading chamber and into the filter membrane.
 9  [00151]     Likewise, a sliding valve can be employed wherein the valve can have a central
 0  aperture 5660b' and a solid member 5660a, as shown in FIG. 56. The sample loading chamber
  1 5620 can be formed with an internal taper which reduces the size of the opening 5620' at the
 2  distal end of the sample loading chamber. When in the closed position the solid member 5660a
 3  overlies or occludes the aperture 5660b', thereby preventing fluid communication with the
o4  underlying filter membrane 5640. Upon translation of the solid member 5660a, the sliding valve
65  aperture 5660b' (which is in alignment with the sample loading chamber opening 5620') is no
66  longer occluded thereby allowing the contents within the sample loading chamber 5620 to fluidly
67  communicate with the underlying filter membrane 5640.           While the exemplary embodiment
68  depicts a circular valve having a single centrally located aperture to permit fluid flow, it is to be
69  understood that alternative shapes, sizes and number of apertures can be provided as desired.

  1 aperture is formed as a crescent shape.
 2  [00152]     Referring again to the cover which can be attached to the filter membrane and
 3  compress the biological sample into a uniform cell block, in some embodiments (as shown in
 4  FIGS. 57-58) the cover can be constructed as a two-piece component 5760a, 5760b. Upper piece
 5  5760a can be telescopingly coupled to the filter membrane to allow displacement of the top piece
 6  into the bottom piece 5760b, and thus onto the biological sample retained on the underlying filter
 7  membrane to compress and facilitate formation of a cell block.               The two-piece cover
 8  embodiment can be assembled via a tongue and groove coupling in which a top piece 5760a
 9  includes protrusions that engage channels within the bottom piece 5760b to permit relative
 .0 movement of the top and bottom pieces.
  1 [00153]     In accordance with another aspect of the disclosed subject matter, the sample loading
 .2 chamber can be provided with an array of sub-chambers 5920', as shown in FIG. 59. Each sub
 '3 chamber 5920' can be used to receive a biological sample from a different specimen/donor.
 .4 Similarly, the filter membrane 5940 can be formed with coinciding apertures 5940' which are
 .5 axially aligned with sub-chamber 5920' so that a plurality of distinct cell blocks can be formed
86  from differing specimens, in one centrifuging cycle.
87  [00154]     Referring again to the single piece retentate chamber (i.e. non-centrifuge applications)
88  of the present disclosure, as described above with reference to FIGS. 49-51A, in another
89  embodiment a membrane can be provided instead of the valve 4970 construction of FIG. 51 a.
90  As shown in FIGS. 60-61A, the single piece retentate chamber 6140 can be formed as a square
91  member with upstanding sidewalls defining the border. The filter membrane border can be
92  formed with upper and lower lips which extend inward from the sidewall. Additionally, the filter
                                                      53

                                                                                       011827. 50995
 3  membrane 6140 is provided with two porous filter meshes (not shown), one which is
 4  substantially flush or coplanar with the top surface of the filter membrane border (attached along
 5  the inwardly extending border lips), and one which is substantially flush or coplanar with the
 6  bottom surface of the filter membrane border. In some embodiments a sealing ring 6142 can be
 7  provided along the inwardly extending border lip to facilitate coupling of the porous filter
 8  meshes to the border. In this regard the filter membrane 6140 serves as a single piece retentate
 9  chamber for the biological sample collected. At least one of the sidewalls includes an inlet port
 '0 6150 in which a biological sample with a fixative is driven into the chamber (e.g. by syringe).
  1 The membrane 6170 is positioned on the interior surface of the border sidewall, between the
 2  upper and lower lips, and protrudes inwardly to the center of the retentate chamber 6140.
 3  Additionally, a cavity or reservoir 6172 is provided adjacent to the membrane 6170. As the
 14 sample and fixative are injected into the port 6150, the solution pools in cavity 6172 until the
 5  pressure increases to displace the thin walled membrane 6172 to allow the solution to flow from
 '6 the reservoir 6172, through the membrane wall(s) 6172 and into the interior chamber.           The
 7  pressure within the chamber increases as the amount of biological sample injected therein
 '8 increases.   This internal pressure, along with gravitational forces, draw the biological sample
 9  through the porous filter membranes (not shown) leaving a cell block retentate within the
10  chamber. As the pressure within the reservoir decreases, the membrane wall(s) 6172 revert back
11  to the resting state forming a seal which prevents flow between the reservoir 6172 and the
12  interior chamber. As previously described, this single piece retentate chamber is constructed of
13  materials which permit sectioning or cutting of the retentate chamber.
14  [00155]     In accordance with an aspect of the disclosed subject matter, and similar to the
15  containers 3200 of FIGS. 32-36F, the retentate chamber filter membrane 6240 can be housed or
                                                     54

  6   stored in a cassette or container 6200.      In the embodiment depicted in FIGS. 62-62A, the
  7   container 6200 itself (with the filter membrane 6240 and cells collected therein) can be retained
  8   in a vessel which includes a bottom 6202 and a lid 6201. Additionally, the container 6200 (with
  9   the filter membrane 6240 and cells collected therein) can be stored within this vessel in an
 '0   upright manner via the sleeves 6203, 6204.
  1 1[00156]       The container 6200 is substantially rectangular, having top and a bottom surface,
 '2   three perpendicular sides, and one sloped side. The top and bottom surfaces are perforated by a
 '3   series of regularly spaces slots to form a grating. The top surface is affixed to one side of the
 '4   container by a hinge.     The top surface can be removably attached to the bottom surface, or
  5   permanently attached, e.g., via a living-hinge, as so desired. Alternatively, the top surface can be
  6   attached to the bottom surface via a tongue and groove coupling such that the top surface
  7   translates or slides in a linear fashion with respect to the bottom surface to open and close the
  8   container 6200.     The grating in container 6200 allows the passage of air, water, or clearing
  9   solutions in order to clean filter membrane 6240.
  0   [00157]      As shown in FIGS 62-63, the container is configured to receive a filter membrane
  1   retentate chamber as embodied and described in FIGS. 60-61A.                Accordingly, the filter
32    membrane 6240 includes a reservoir 6272 and membrane 6270 (see FIG. 63). The container
33    6200 includes a port 6255 (e.g. a luer port) which is aligned with the inlet port 6250 in the
34    sidewall of the filter membrane 6240. The technician can connect a syringe or pump to container
35    port 6255 to inject a biological sample through the inlet port of the filter membrane, into the
36    reservoir 6272, and ultimately through the membrane 6270 where the filtration process can
37    occur.     The container 6200 can also be subjected to additional processing, e.g., injection of
38    paraffin wax and molding as described above with respect to FIGS. 32-36F.

 -0 [00158]     The various components identified in these embodiments can be discrete members
 .1 which are assembled in such a manner that each component is readily removable (i.e. detachable
 -2 without breaking). Such a construction is advantageous in that it allows for rapid assembly in
 -3 preparation for the centrifuge process, and subsequent disassembly in order to rapidly access the
 .4 filter membrane and the collected cell sample disposed thereon. This readily removable feature
 -5 avoids risk of contamination presented by permanent or welded connections which require
 -6 fracturing or breaking of components and seals, and the debris associated with such efforts, to

 .9 example, the filter assembly can be color coded so that the laboratory personnel or the clinicians
 .0 can easily identify the type of sample in the filter assembly. For the purpose of illustration and
  1 not limitation, the material of the filter assembly can be purple to denote a liver sample, and blue
 .2 to denote a lung sample. The color codes of the filter assembly or the elongate tubular body can
 .3 be coordinated with the compressive cover to function as indicia.
