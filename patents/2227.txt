   ABSTRACT
   A roofing system for a building is disclosed.             The roofing
   system includes a plurality of roof cladding sheets                  (7) in
 5 overlapping relationship and a plurality of concealed clip
   assemblies that retain the cladding sheets to an
   underlying roof support structure  (5).     Each cladding
   sheet has at least one rib  (11) separated by pans               (3).
   Each clip assembly includes an elongate strap member(71),
10 a plurality of clips  (3) mounted to an upper surface of
   the strap member and engaging re-entrant portions of the
   ribs of one or more sheets, and a plurality of spacer
   members  (55) made of thermally insulating material mounted
   to a lower surface of the strap member in alignment with
15 the clips and spacing the clips above the underlying
   structure.

                         A ROOFING SYSTEM
             The present invention relates to roofing systems
   that include cladding sheets that are retained to
 5 underlying roof support structures by concealed clip
   assemblies.
             The present invention is concerned with
   minimising heat transfer via roofing systems from and to
10 the interior of buildings.
             Typically, roof cladding sheets are roll-formed
   from painted or unpainted steel strip and include one or
   more parallel ribs, pan sections, and side edge formations
15 that enable the sheets to be positioned side by side in
   overlapping relationship.
             It is known to secure cladding sheets to an
   underlying roof support structure, such as roof purlins,
20 by fastening the sheets directly to the underlying
   structure using fasteners, such as roofing nails, that
   pierce the sheets and penetrate the underlying structure.
             It is also known to secure cladding sheets to an
25 underlying structure by using clip assemblies that include
   clips that are secured to the structure by fasteners and
   are formed to extend into the ribs and engage re-entrant
   portions of the ribs and thereby retain the sheets to the
   clips.  These clip assemblies are often preferred over
30 nails because they enable concealed fixing of cladding
   sheets to an underlying structure.
             There are a number of known concealed fixing
   retaining clips.  The clips include a so-called WG clip
35 disclosed in Australian patent 457099 in the name of
   Comalco Limited, a clip disclosed in UK patent application
   in the name of Stramit Industries Limited, and a clip
                                          9871249_1 (GHMatters) P45301.AU.9 12/01/18

   disclosed in Australian patent 685102 and other Australian
   patents and patent applications in the name of Stramit
   Corporation.
 5           In warm climates there is considerable cost in
   keeping the inside of buildings cool compared to the
   outside.
             Many modern buildings are air-conditioned and the
10 cost of air-conditioning is an important cost
   consideration.
             In cool climates there is considerable cost in
   keeping the inside of buildings warm compared to the
15 outside.  Many modern buildings are heated and the cost of
   heating is an important cost consideration.
             By far the largest amount of heat transfer from
   and to the interior of a building is through the roofing
20 system of the building.  Thus, a roofing system that
   minimises heat transfer is one option for reducing air
   conditioning and heating costs.
             The present invention is concerned with providing
25 a roofing system for a building that minimises heat
   transfer via the roofing system from and to the interior
   of the building.
             The present invention is also concerned with
30 providing a clip assembly of a roofing system for a
   building that minimises heat transfer via the clip
   assembly from and to the interior of the building.
             The present invention provides a roofing system
35 for a building that includes:  a plurality of roof cladding
   sheets in overlapping relationship, each cladding sheet
   having at least one rib and pans;  and a plurality of
                                          9871249_1 (GHMatters) P45301.AU.9 12/01/18

                              - 3
   concealed clip assemblies that retain the cladding sheets
   to an underlying roof support structure, each clip
   assembly including:
 5           (a)  an elongate strap member;
             (b)  a plurality of clips mounted to an upper
                  surface of the strap member and engaging
                  re-entrant portions of the ribs of one or
10                more sheets;  and
             (c)  a plurality of spacer members made of
                  thermally insulating material mounted to a
                  lower surface of the strap member in
15                alignment with the clips and spacing the
                  clips above the underlying structure.
             The present invention also provides a roofing
   system for a building that includes: a plurality of roof
20 cladding sheets in overlapping relationship, each cladding
   sheet having at least one rib and pans;   and a plurality of
   concealed clip assemblies that retain the cladding sheets
   to an underlying roof support structure, each clip
   assembly including:
25
             (a)  a clip that engages re-entrant portions of
                  the rib; and
             (b)  a spacer member that spaces the clip above
30                the underlying structure.
             Spacing the clips above the underlying structure
   by means of the thermally insulating spacer members
   prevents direct contact between the clips and the
35 structure and this of itself increases the thermal
   resistance of the clip assembly per se and the roofing
   system as a whole.
                                         9871249_1 (GHMatters) P45301.AU.9 12/01/18

                               - 4
             Spacing the clips above the underlying structure
   also has the effect of spacing the cladding sheets further
   above the underlying structure than would normally be the
 5 case.  The additional space may be filled with thermal
   insulation material or left as an air gap.         In either
   case, there is a contribution to the thermal resistance of
   the roofing system.
10           Preferably the roofing system includes:
              (a)  a layer of thermal insulation material,

   plurality of fastening assemblies that secure the clip
   assemblies to the underlying structure.
             Preferably each fastening assembly includes a

20 depending sleeve that extends into the opening in the base
   of the clip and separates the fastener shank from the
   base.
             Preferably each clip includes a pair of cladding
25 sheet retaining members that extend upwardly from opposite
   sides of the base.
             Preferably each cladding sheet retaining member
   includes an outwardly-turned top flange that has a central
30 upper section and two outer sections that extend
   downwardly from opposite ends of the upper section,
   whereby the outer sections of the top flanges of the
   retaining members contact the re-entrant portions of the
   rib of the cladding sheet and secure the sheet to the
35 clip.
             Preferably each cladding sheet retaining member
                                         9871249_1 (GHMatters) P45301.AU.9 12/01/18

                              - 6

             (b)  a plurality of spacer members made of
35                thermally insulating material mounted to

                                         9871249_1 (GHMatters) P45301.AU.9 12/01/18

                              - 7
                  platforms on the upper surface.
             According to the present invention there is also
   provided a clip assembly for a roofing system as described
 5 in the preceding paragraph and a plurality of clips for
   engaging cladding sheets mounted on the platforms.
             The present invention is described further by way
   of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, of

             The roofing system for a building shown in the
   figures includes:
                                         9871249_1 (GHMatters) P45301.AU.9 12/01/18

                               - 8
             (a)  a plurality of roof cladding sheets 7                  (only
                  one of which is shown in Figure 1);
 5           (b)  a plurality of concealed fixing clip
                  assemblies  (only one of which is shown in
                  Figures 1 to 4) retaining the cladding
                  sheets to roof support purlins 5;             and
10           (c)  a layer of fibreglass insulation material
                  57  (Figure 1 only) occupying part of the
                  roof cavity defined by the cladding sheets
                  7 and the roof purlins 5.
15           Each concealed fixing clip assembly includes:
             (a)  an elongate strap 71;
             (b)  a plurality of clips 3 mounted to an upper
20                surface of the strap 71 and engaging the
                  cladding sheets 7;  and
             (c)  spacer members in the form of high density
                  polystyrene blocks 55 mounted to a lower
25                surface of the strap 71 and spacing the
                  clips 3 above the purlins 5.
             The straps 71 are a convenient means of mounting
   a plurality of the clips 3 and the spacer members 55 and
30 thereafter locating the clips 3 at required spacings for
   engaging the cladding sheets.
             Each strap 71 is formed from sheet steel and
   includes a flat central section 77 and downwardly folded
35 sides 79.  The sides 79 improve the rigidity of the strap
   71.  Each strap 71 includes a series of spaced apart
   mounting platforms 81 for the clips 3.     The mounting
                                          9871249_1 (GHMatters) P45301.AU.9 12/01/18

                               - 9
   platforms 81 are flattened sections on which the clips 3
   can be mounted.
              The high density polystyrene block spacer members
 5 55 are mounted to the lower surface of the straps 71,                   for
   example by means of adhesive or adhesive-backed tape.                     The
   spacer members 55 are positioned to be aligned with the
   clips 3.
10            The spacer members 55 provide support for the
   cladding sheets 7 against downward loads and have
   substantially the same insulating properties as the
   surrounding fibreglass insulation material.           Thus, the
   spacer members 55 provide resistance to heat transfer
15 between the cladding sheets 7 and the interior of the
   building via the clips 3, the straps 71, and the purlins
   5.  It is noted that the sides 79 of the straps 71 extend
   only a relatively short distance down the height of the
   spacer members 55 so as to maintain a relatively long heat
20 transfer path through the insulating material.              Typically,
   the length of the sides is no more than 30% of the height
   of the spacer members 55.
              In addition, the spacer members 55 space the
25 cladding sheets 7 above the layer of fibreglass insulation
   material 57 so that the roofing system further includes an
   air gap 59   (Figure 1 only) in the roof cavity between the
   cladding sheets 7 and the fibreglass insulation material,
   and thus further improves the resistance to heat transfer
30 provided by the roofing system.
              The block spacer members 55 may be any suitable
   shape and dimensions.    Typically the spacer members 55
   have a square base with a width and length that             is    not
35 greatly larger than that of the base of the clips 3.
              The roof system also includes fastening
                                           9871249_1 (GHMatters) P45301.AU.9 12/01/18

                              - 10
   assemblies securing the clip assemblies to the purlins 5.
             Each fastening assembly includes a fastener in
   the form of a small diameter screw 51 that secures a clip
 5 3 to a purlin 5.   The shank of the screw 51 extends
   through the clip 3, and then successively through the
   underlying mounting platform of the strap 71 and the
   aligned spacer member 55, and then into the purlin 5.
10           Each fastening assembly also includes a washer 65
   that is formed from a thermally insulating material, such
   as rubber.   The washer 65 prevents direct contact between
   the clip 3 and the head of the screw 51.
15            In addition, the washer 65 includes a downwardly
   extending sleeve 69 that extends into the opening 63 in
   the clip 3 and separates the shank of the screw 51 from
   the clip 3.
20           The applicant has found in experimental work that
   the combination of the above-described features of the
   spacer members 55, the air gap 59, the small diameter
   screws 51, and the washers 65 formed from thermally
   insulating material reduces heat transfer from the
25 cladding sheets 7 to the purlins 5 and thereby to the
   interior of a building and vice versa.
             Each cladding sheet 7 is roll-formed from sheet
   steel and includes a leading edge 8, a trailing edge 10, a
30 central lengthwise extending rib, generally identified by
   the numeral 11, and pair of lengthwise extending pans 13
   on opposite sides of the rib 11.
             The cladding sheet 7 may be of any suitable
35 length and width and may include any suitable number of
   ribs 11 separated by pans 3.
                                          9871249_1 (GHMatters) P45301.AU.9 12/01/18

                              - 11
             The rib 11 of the cladding sheet 7 includes an
   upper clip retaining section, generally identified by the
   numeral 15, and two downwardly extending shoulders 17 that
   interconnect the upper clip retaining section 15 and the
 5 pans 13.
             With particular reference to Figure 7, the upper
   clip retaining section 15 includes a flat upper section 19
   that separates two sides, generally identified by the
10 numeral 21.   Each side 21 includes a first section 41 that
   extends outwardly and downwardly from the upper section
   19, a second section 43 that extends downwardly and
   inwardly from the lower edge of the first section 41,                  and
   a third section 45 that extends downwardly and outwardly
15 from the second section 43 and merges with the shoulder
   17.
             The second sections 43 of each upper retaining
   clip section 15 define opposed re-entrant portions of the
20 rib 13 and are hereinafter referred to as "re-entrant
   portions 43".
             Each shoulder 17 includes a first part 17a that
   extends upwardly from the pan 13 and a second section 17b
25 that extends from the first section 17a to the clip
   retaining section 15.   The first part 17a has a steeper
   slope than the second part 17b.   In overall terms, the
   shoulders 17 are a significant component of the total size
   of the rib 11.
30
             The leading and trailing edges 8, 10 of the
   cladding sheet 7 are formed as partially-completed ribs in
   order to facilitate interlocking of successive cladding
   sheets.  These partially-completed ribs are hereinafter
35 referred to as "leading edge formations 8"       and "trailing
   edge formations 10".

                              - 12
             Each clip 3 is formed by folding a flat metal
   blank into the configuration shown the Figures.
             With particular reference to Figure 4, each clip
 5 3 includes:
              (a)  a flat base 21; and
              (b)  a pair of retaining members, generally
10                 identified by the numeral 23, extending
                   upwardly on opposite sides of the base 21,
                   whereby the base 21 and the retaining
                   members 23 form a generally U-shaped
                   member.

             Each retaining member 23 includes an upstanding
   main wall element 61 that terminates in an outwardly
   extending top flange 25.
20           Each top flange 25 includes a central upper
   section 27 and two opposed sections 29 that slope
   downwardly from the upper section 27.
             The downwardly sloping sections 29 terminate in
25 lower edges 31.
             The downwardly sloping sections 29 extend
   outwardly and downwardly beyond the upper sections of the
   main wall elements 61.   The sections 29 include downwardly
30 facing shoulders 57 that connect the sections 29 to the
   main wall elements 61.
             Each clip 3 also includes an opening 63 to
   facilitate securing the clip 3 to a purlin 5.
35
             In use, a plurality of the clip assemblies is
   fastened to purlins 5 at spaced intervals along the length
                                          9871249_1 (GHMatters) P45301.AU.9 12/01/18

                              - 13
   of the purlins 5 using the screws 51 of the fastening
   assemblies.
              Batts of fibreglass insulation material are then
 5 positioned on the purlins 5 and arranged to extend beneath
   the straps 71 to form the layer 57 of insulation material
   shown in Figure 1.
              Thereafter, cladding sheets 7 are successively
10 placed over the purlins 5 in overlapping relationship. The
   cladding sheets 7 are positioned so that the longitudinal
   direction of the ribs 11 is perpendicular to the planes of
   the main wall elements 61 of the clips 3.
15            The cladding sheets 7 are then progressively
   engaged with the clips 3 as the sheets are successively
   placed over the purlins 5.
              This is achieved by successively pressing the
20 leading edge formations 8, the ribs 11, and the trailing
   edge formations 10 of the sheets 7 onto the clips 3 so
   that the leading edge formations 8, the ribs 11,             and the
   trailing edge formations 10 deflect outwardly and the top
   flanges 25 of the clips 3 deflect inwardly.
25
              This movement allows the leading edge formations
   8, the ribs 11, and the trailing edge formations 10 to be
   positioned on the clips 3 with the lower edges 31 and the
   shoulders 57 of the flanges 25 engaging the re-entrant
30 portions 43 of the ribs 11 so that the cladding sheets 7
   are secured to the clips 3.
             Many modifications may be made to the preferred
   embodiment of the roofing system described above without
35 departing from the spirit and scope of the present
   invention.
