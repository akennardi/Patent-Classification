   Field
   The present invention relates to a method of credit input
20 and a gaming system.
   Background to the Invention
   Traditionally, electronic gaming machines have taken the
25 form of slot machines where a player plays a game
   involving reels that spin and prizes are awarded based on
   the position at which the reels stop relative to win lines
   selected by the player.   Originally, these machines were
   mechanical with physically rotating reels.     In many modern
30 slot machines, the mechanical reels have been replaced by
   "virtual reels displayed as spinning on a video display.
   More recently, there has been a move towards implementing
   other types of games such as table games including poker,
35 blackjack or roulette on electronic gaming machines
   including as multi-player games.   Motivations for doing so
   include that less staff may be required and games can be
                                               9759881_1 (GHMatters) P71729.AU.5 13/12/17

   Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
20 arranged to handle credit input in respect of a multi
   player game.  The gaming system is preferably implemented
   as a virtual gaming table, where a horizontally oriented
   touch screen display is used by players to participate in
   a game. The gaming system can take a number of different
25 forms.
   In a first form, a stand alone gaming table is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present or located next to a player operable
30 virtual gaming table.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present located with the gaming table and
35 some of the components are located remotely.       For example,
   a "thick client" architecture may be used wherein part of
   the game is executed locally by the player operable gaming
                                              9759881_1 (GHMatters) P71729.AU.5 13/12/17

   table and part of the game is executed remotely, such as
   by a gaming server; or a "thin client" architecture may be
   used wherein most of the game is executed remotely such as
   by a gaming server and a player operable gaming table is
 5 used only to display audible and/or visible gaming
   information to the player and receive gaming inputs from
   the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
10 envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming table is networked to a gaming server and
   the respective functions of the gaming table and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.    For example,
   the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming table
15 mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending
   on the game being played, operating conditions, and so on.
   Other variations will be apparent to persons skilled in
   the art.
20 Figure 1 is a plan view of a virtual gaming table 100
   having a horizontally oriented display 120 and a log on
   terminal 140.   As can been from Figure 1, the gaming table
   is surrounded by seven chairs 130 indicating seven
   possible player positions.   Two player interfaces 124a,
25 124b are active on the display 120.   A central area 122 of
   the display is used to display information common to all
   players; in the example shown in Figure 1 a display of a
   roulette game.
30 As shown in Figure 2, from a functional perspective, a
   virtual table 200 comprises a game controller 220, a
   common display 212 and a variable number of player
   interfaces 210.   As described in detail below, in the
   embodiment the number of player interfaces depends on the
35 number of players playing the game.   In some embodiments
   there may be a single player interface for each player so
   that each time a player enters the game an interface is
                                               9759881_1 (GHMatters) P71729.AU.5 13/12/17

                               - 8
   added.   In other embodiments, a minimum number of player
   interfaces may always be displayed even though it is
   possible they are not all being used and additional player
   interfaces added as necessary, when the minimum is
 5 exceeded. Unused interfaces may function in an attract
   mode.   In further embodiments, a player may request an
   additional player interface.    For example, some players
   may wish to play two hands of cards simultaneously where
   the gaming table implements a card game.
10
   In the embodiment, a number of the functional modules of
   the game controller are implemented by a processor 215.
   However, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that
   other techniques such dedicated hardware could be used
15 instead of program code running on a processor 215 to
   implement the required functions.
   The game controller's processor 215 processes the game
   play instructions in accordance with game play rules and
20 outputs game play outcomes to the display. Typically, the
   game play instructions are stored as program code in a
   memory 270. Herein the term "processor" is used to refer
   generically to any device that can process game play
   instructions in accordance with game play rules and may
25 include:  a microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable
   logic device or other computational device, a general
   purpose computer  (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   These functions are carried out based on data such as
30 credit data 272 and game rule data 274 stored in a memory
   270 of the game controller 220.    The game controller 220
   has a number of modules including a display controller 230
   for controlling what is displayed both in the common
   display area 212 of a gaming table 212 and on each of the
35 player interfaces 210.
   The display 120 incorporates a touch screen.         Herein such
                                                9759881_1 (GHMatters) P71729.AU.5 13/12/17

                              - 9
   a display is referred to as "touch screen display".
   Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the player
   interfaces share a common display 120.  A person skilled
   in the art will appreciate that the "touch screen" sensor
 5 need not cover the entire display.  For example central
   area 122 as shown in Figure 1 need not necessarily have a
   touch screen capability.  The touch screen is preferably a
   multi-touch screen capable of processing simultaneous or
   near simultaneous instructions from a number of different
10 players.  The display 120 itself is typically a wide
   screen, large format display such as a plasma or LCD
   display of a size in the order of 80-120 inches (2m -                    3m)
   across the diagonal.  However, a person skilled in the art
   will appreciate that the display could be formed a
15 plurality of sub-units located adjacent to one another
   under the control of the display controller 230 to display
   both the player interfaces 210 and the common display area
   212.
20 The display controller 230 controls the display to display
   the individual player interfaces based on data provided by
   the interface controller 240 and the outcome determiner
   260.  The interface controller also provides data to the
   touch screen processor 250 to enable it to interpret
25 touches on the touch screen display, for example, in order
   to associate them with individual player interfaces 210
   and to provide this data to the outcome determiner 260.
   In this manner, individual player instructions can be
   correctly provided to the outcome determiner 260 so that
30 the outcome determiner 266 can determine the result of the
   game based on the game rule data 274.  Similarly, the
   outcome determiner 260 provides data to the display
   controller 230 regarding the game outcomes for individual
   players.  This may be displayed in a display region of the
35 player interface 210 on the common display or both.
   A person skilled in the art will appreciate that depending
                                              9759881_1 (GHMatters) P71729.AU.5 13/12/17

                               - 10
   on the game, the outcome determiner 260 may determine
   independent results for each player such as in a game like
   roulette or results that depend on the game play of other
   players such as in a competitive game like poker.                  Credit
 5 data 272 is maintained separately for each player
   interface in memory 270.   The log-on terminal 280
   typically includes a touch screen display allowing a
   player to enter their name and assign to themselves a
   player position number - i.e. a particular player
10 interface.  Alternatively the player position maybe
   assigned by the game system.    In alternative embodiments,
   players may be assigned positions anonymously by providing
   them with a temporary access code, printed by the log-on
   terminal on a voucher.   In still further embodiments, the
15 player is given an entitlement to a player interface by
   the log-on process and the player interface is allocated
   or generated based on where the player sits relative to
   the table.
20 To participate in the game a player uses the log-on
   terminal 280 to request a player interface for the game
   either manually, or by swiping or otherwise providing a
   player tracking device to the log on terminal 280.                   That
   is, depending on the embodiment the log on terminal may
25 read magnetic cards, smart cards, RFID tags or another
   suitable data carrier.
   The player may also use the log-on terminal to log out of
   the game or alternatively may operate the player interface
30 to log out of the game.
   At least one credit input/output mechanism 290 is provided
   which can be shared by all players of the gaming system.
35 In one embodiment, the credit input/output mechanism
   includes a voucher printer 295.    A player provides credit
   to the credit input/output 290 by inserting currency using
                                                9759881_1 (GHMatters) P71729.AU.5 13/12/17

                               - 11
   a bill 291 or coin 292 acceptor or by providing their
   player trading device to the reader 294 and specifying an
   amount, e.g. by use of a keypad 296, to be retrieved from
   an account associated with the tracking device which may
 5 be stored on a player account server 412 such as is shown
   in Figure 4.
   Figure 3 is a further block diagram showing credit manager
   300 in more detail.   Referring to figure 3, credit manager
10 300 processes data received from the credit record and the
   credit creates a record in credit data 272 specifying the
   amount of input credits and associates a credit identifier
   with the credit record, typically by generating a unique
   credit identifier.   A voucher is printed by a voucher
15 printer 295.   The voucher has the credit identifier on it
   so that the player can enter it at a player interface 210
   using a virtual key pad.   The credit manager controller
   220 processes the input credit identifier and verifies it
   against records stored as credit data 272.      If the credit
20 identifier is verified, the amount of credit is associated
   with the player interface used to enter the credit
   identifier.   In this respect, a credit balance is
   maintained within the credit data for each player
   interface.   Thus, the credit is transferred to the credit
25 balance for the player interface.    Once the player
   interface has been allocated the credit, tokens
   corresponding to the credit will be present within the
   player's player interface 210.
30 To this end, the credit manager 300 has a number of
   modules including a credit record generator 310 which
   generates a credit record corresponding to the amount of
   input credit, a credit identifier issuer 320 which issues
   credit identifiers in accordance with predetermined rules,
35 for example, it may generate the identifier randomly or
   from a set of identifiers.    Both the credit record
   generator 310 and the credit identifier issuer 320 are
   adapted to communicate data to the credit data 272 of the
   memory.
                                                9759881_1 (GHMatters) P71729.AU.5 13/12/17

                              - 12
   The credit manager 300 also includes an identifier
   requester 330 adapted to request that a player enter an
   identifier and cause the display controller to display
 5 this request on one of the player interfaces 210 in
   response to an attempt by a player to allocate the credit
   to their player interface.
   A credit identifier processor and credit allocator 340
10 processes input requests and if the credit identifier is
   correct updates the credit data 272 such that a credit
   meter associated with the player interface includes the
   credit balance of the relevant credit record.
15 The most common, example of a gaming "token" is a chip.
   However, other tokens such as coins or the like may be
   employed.
   With reference to Figure 2, the interface controller
20 provides to display controller 230 data stored          (in memory
   270) as interface data 273 that specifies which parts of
   the player interface are assigned to the different areas
   of the player interface 210.   Figure 5 is a schematic
   diagram of such a player interface  (shown generally at
25 500), which has a chip stack area 510, a bet manipulation
   area 520 and a bet commitment area 530 so that these areas
   are displayed to a player.   Token data 275 specifies the
   number of tokens associated with a player interface and
   their current locations within the player interface 500.
30 The touch screen processor 250 determines when a player
   touches the screens and employs the token data to
   determine which token or tokens the player has touched. In
   an exemplary embodiment, a player moves a token by
   touching the touch screen in the vicinity of token and
35 dragging their finger across the screen to a new position.
   When the player releases or removes their finger from the
   touch screen the movement is completed.
                                               9759881_1 (GHMatters) P71729.AU.5 13/12/17

                               - 13
   In an alternative mode of control, the touch screen
   processor 250 is configured to detect the speed at which a
   player moves their hand relative to the screen such that a
 5 player can "flick" a token by rapidly moving their finger
   in a direction they wish the chip to go to impart a vector
   velocity to the chip.   The touch screen processor 250.
   The touch screen processor 250 implements manipulation
   rules  (stored in memory 270 as manipulation rules data
lo 276) in respect of a player's touching of the tokens. In
   the embodiment, after a new credit record is created by
   the credit manager, the credit manager 300 causes the
   display controller 230 to display in a new token display
   area 213 of the common display 212, tokens corresponding
15 to the amount of credit in the credit records.           A player
   reaches over to the new token display area 213 on the
   common display 212, touches the tokens in the new display
   area 213 and drags them towards their player interface
   area.   When the tokens are released by the player within
20 the player's interface area 500 or within a specific sub
   area, such as the bet manipulation area 520 or the chip
   stack area 510, the touch screen processor advises the
   credit manager 300 that a player has attempted to allocate
   the tokens to their player interface.   The identifier
25 requester 330 causes the display controller 230 a virtual
   keypad 620 as shown in Figure 6 and a request for a player
   to "enter code" 625 to thereby request that the player
   submit the credit identifier that they received
   previously.   If the correct credit identifier is entered
30 as described above, the credit amount, in the example
   shown in Figure 7, 575 units of chips are added to the
   player's chip stack area 510 in this case in a pile of
   five 100 unit chips 712, and three 25 unit chips 714.                       The
   player's total of chips is also updated 722.

   Figure 8 is a flowchart 800 showing a method of the
   embodiment.   Accordingly there is implemented method 800
                                               9759881_1 (GHMatters) P71729.AU.5 13/12/17

   where a credit input is received 810, a credit record is
   generated 820, a credit identifier is associated with a
   credit record 830.  Tokens corresponding to the credit
   record are displayed 835.   The touch screen is monitored
 5 for an attempt to allocate the tokens to a player
   interface 840.  If a user attempts to allocate the tokens
   to themselves the user is prompted for a credit identifier
   850.  At step 860 the method involves receiving and
   processing the credit identifier and if the identifier is
10 correct at step 870 the method involves allocating the
   credit record to the credit meter of the player interface
   870.
   Various further features or modifications will be apparent
15 to persons skilled in the art.   For example, the code will
   typically be in a string of alphanumerical characters, for
   example a number or word or mixture of the two.            Further
   an alternative to issuing an identifier to a player is to
   allow a player to choose their own code.   Where the player
20 has a player tracking device with a code associated
   therewith, this may be a code previously associated with
   the tracking device for the player or alternatively a
   short password may be generated for the player that the
   player appends to their normal code.
25
   Further, where the virtual table is networked, the
   terminal may contact the casino management system 412 and
   pass the transaction record to it.   In this embodiment,
   transaction records are subsequently retrieved over the
30 network when the player approaches the game.
   Further, while Figure 2 shows the credit manager and
   credit data being common functional components of the
   gaming system.  A credit input mechanism may be provided
35 as a money terminal and be physically separate or may be
   provided as part of the log-on terminal 140 shown in
   Figure 1.  In this case, an initial credit record may be
   established within the money terminal and the virtual
   table contacts the money terminal to obtain a transaction
                                               9759881_1 (GHMatters) P71729.AU.5 13/12/17

                               - 15
   record stored in memory matching the entered credit
   identifier.   If such a record exists, the associated money
   amount is credited to the gaming machine and the
   transaction record is marked as used within the terminal.
 5 It will be appreciated that in this example, the credit
   manager function is provided in combination by the virtual
   table and the money terminal.
   A person skilled in the art will also appreciate that the
10 player will wish to cash out or takes his credits
   elsewhere at the end of a gaming session.    In an
   embodiment, each player interface is provided with a
   button or touch screen marked "End Session".         Pressing
   this action causes the gaming machine to create a new
15 credit record and either generates a credit identifier,
   uses a credit identifier that was previously input by the
   player, or generates a short password such as a three
   digit number and appends it to the password previously
   input by the player or similar technique.    The gaming
20 machine associates the credit record with the credit
   identifier and the credits are associated with the credit
   record.   If a new password has been generated or a short
   password has been generated this is displayed to the
   player.   The player must memorise or write down the new
25 password.   The transaction record may also be transferred
   to the casino management system or the money terminal.
   The credit meter is reset to zero for the player interface
   and the player can leave the gaming machine.        The player
   then approaches the credit mechanism and, depending upon
30 implementation, the player either inserts the ticket he
   obtained from the money terminal originally, types in the
   password or types in the password followed by the short
   password.   This is processed by the money terminal to
   locate the transaction records.   The terminal obtains the
35 credit records and provides a payout to the player.
   In the case where multiple money terminals exist, it is
                                               9759881_1 (GHMatters) P71729.AU.5 13/12/17

                               - 16
   desirable to have a casino management system in order to
   create unique credit records for each credit input or
   output.   However this is not strictly necessarily provided
   each credit manager function is arranged to issue unique
 5 credit records.
   Further, if a player associates their player tracking
   device with the original transaction, this information can
   be carried along with every subsequent transaction such
10 that when a player needs to cash out, they only need to
   reinsert or otherwise associate their player tracking
   device with a payout terminal to obtain their money.
   Various techniques can be used to improve the security of
   the passwords, for example passwords can be time limited
15 and once the time runs out the ticket would need to be re
   inserted to the terminal 140 to generate a new ticket or
   password.   This would cut down the number of active
   passwords at any one time.    Further, the gaming table can
   be arranged to alert an operator or security staff if a
20 large number of incorrect passwords attempts are made.
   The above embodiment has been described in relation to a
   virtual gaming table where players share a display to
   provide a plurality of player interfaces.     Persons skilled
25 in the art will appreciate that the same technique can be
   applied in any situation whether a plurality of player
   interfaces such as may be provided by a plurality of stand
   alone electronic gaming machines, share a common credit
   input mechanism.
30
   In some embodiments, tokens corresponding to new credit
   records may be displayed at a plurality of locations to
   make it convenient for a player to reach the virtual
   tokens.   In other embodiments, a notification may be
35 provided on each player interface that there is a new
   credit record.   In other embodiments, a newly added player
   interface or a dormant interface may revert to a view such
                                                9759881_1 (GHMatters) P71729.AU.5 13/12/17

   Figure 4 shows a gaming system 400 in accordance with an
 5 alternative embodiment.   The gaming system 400 includes a
   network 401, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming tables 403, are connected to the network 401.                     The
   gaming tables 202 provide a player operable interface for
   the gaming system 400.
10
   One or more displays 404 may also be connected to the
   network 401.   The displays 404 may, for example, be
   associated with one or more gaming tables 203.           The
   displays 404 may be used to display representations
15 associated with game play on the gaming tables 402, and/or
   used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 405 implements
20 part of the game played by a players using a gaming table
   403 and the gaming table 403 implements part of the game.
   With this embodiment, as both the game server and the
   gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
25 management server 406 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 402 in a database 406A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 407 will be provided to monitor and
30 carry out the Jackpot game.
   In a thin client embodiment (or networked gaming
   embodiment),  game server 405 implements most or all of the
   game played by a player using a gaming table 403 and the
35 gaming table 403 essentially provides only the player
   interface.   With this embodiment, the game server 405
   provides the game controller. The gaming table 403 will
                                               9759881_1 (GHMatters) P71729.AU.5 13/12/17

   405 which will process them and return game play outcomes
   to the gaming table 403 for display.
 5 Player accounts may be maintained by player account server
   412 which stores an account including a credit balance for
   player's having a player tracking device as well as other
   data such as loyalty data for a loyalty program.              A player
   accesses their account by presenting their player tracking
10 device to the credit input/output mechanism 290 of the
   virtual gaming table 403.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 400, including for
15 example a gaming floor management server 408, and a
   licensing server 409 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   410 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 401 and the devices connected to the network.
20
   The gaming network 400 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 411.

   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
   plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
30 may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 405 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
   could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
35 will appreciate that a plurality of games servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
