       SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PROVIDING LEARNING MODULES FOR
                                     LEARNING SYSTEMS
   [00011        This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No.
 5 <removed-apn>, itself a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2011201981, the
   entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
   FIELD
   [0001a]       The embodiments described herein relate to electronic learning, and more
10 particularly to systems and methods for providing educational course design and
   assessment for electronic learning systems that include learning modules.
   INTRODUCTION
   [0002]        Electronic learning (also called e-Learning or eLearning) generally refers
15 to learning where users engage in education related activities using computers and
   other computer devices. For examples, users may enroll or participate in a course or
   program of study offered by an educational institution (e.g. a college, university or
   grade school) through a web interface that is accessible over the Internet. Similarly,
   users may receive assignments electronically, participate in group work and projects by
20 collaborating online, and be graded based on assignments and examinations that are
   submitted using an electronic dropbox or other similar service.
   [0003]        Electronic learning is not limited to use by educational institutions,
   however, and may also be used in governments or in corporate environments. For
25 example, employees at a regional branch office of a particular company may use
   electronic learning to participate in a training course offered by another office without
   ever physically leaving their office.
   [0004]        In most electronic learning systems, some users are consumers or "learners"
30 and will participate in courses (e.g. by listening or watching lectures, conducting
   assignments, and taking quizzes, etc.) while other users are providers or "instructors" who
   may be responsible for preparing the course framework, including the course structure

                                           -IA
and/or materials (e.g. determining what topics are to be covered in a particular course, what
assignments will be required, how performance is to be assessed, etc.).

                                              -2
      [0005]        However, planning the framework of courses (e.g. selecting the
      course structure, organizing lecture materials, etc.) can be a difficult exercise.
     This is true generally with all forms of learning, but is particularly problematic in
     electronic learning systems.
  5   [0006]        For example, in a traditional course setting, it may be sufficient to
     prepare materials as the course is taught (e.g. a "just-in-time" approach) since
     the course normally follows a particular chronological sequence or timeline.
     However, in electronic learning systems some users may be progressing through
     the course content at different rates of speed, or may review educational
 10  modules in different orders depending on particular interests. Accordingly, it may
     be beneficial if the course structures and materials are determined in advance.
     [0007]         Many users lack the skills and training to properly prepare courses.
     In particular, users may not be familiar with the design or creation of electronic
     learning courses, and may be intimidated by concepts related to designing
 15  content and thus have difficulty in providing a course in an electronic learning
     system. In some cases, users may not be familiar with instructional theory to
    design courses that are pedagogically sound. Moreover, users who wish to
    design courses are often required to create everything for the course and they
    are often unable to take advantage of content and assessments that were
20  previously generated for other courses.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION
     [0070]         For simplicity and     clarity of illustration, where    considered
    appropriate, reference numerals may be repeated among the figures to indicate
    corresponding or analogous elements or steps. In addition, numerous specific
15  details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the
    exemplary embodiments described herein. However, it will be understood by
    those of ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments described herein may be
    practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods,
    procedures and components have not been described in detail so as not to
20  obscure the embodiments generally described herein.
    [0071]         Furthermore, this description is not to be considered as limiting the
    scope of the embodiments described herein in any way, but rather as merely
    describing the implementation of various embodiments as described.
    [0072]         The embodiments of the systems and methods described herein
25  may be implemented in hardware or software, or a combination of both. For
    example, some embodiments may be implemented in computer systems and
    computer programs, which may be stored on a physical computer readable
    medium, executable on programmable computers (e.g. computing devices and/or
    processing devices) each comprising at least one processor, a data storage

                                               -10
        system (including volatile and non-volatile memory and/or storage elements), at
        least one input device (e.g. a keyboard or mouse), and at least one output device
        (e.g. a display screen, a network, or a remote server). For example and without
        limitation, the programmable computers may include servers, personal
   5   computers, laptops, netbook computers, personal data assistants (PDA), cell
       phones, smart phones, gaming devices, and other mobile devices.
       [0073]         In some embodiments, program code can be applied to input data
       to perform the functions described herein and to generate output information.
       The output information can then be supplied to one or more output devices for
 10   outputting to one or more users.
       [0074]         Turning now to Figure 1, illustrated therein is an educational system
       10 for providing electronic learning according to some embodiments for providing
      guided instructional design according to some embodiments.
      [0075]          Using the system 10, one or more users 12, 14 may communicate
 15   with an educational service provider 30 to participate in, create, and consume
      electronic learning services, including courses. In some embodiments, the
      educational service provider 30 may be part of or associated with a traditional
      "bricks and mortar" educational institution (e.g. a grade school, university or
     college), another entity that provides educational services (e.g. an online
20   university, a company that specializes in offering training courses, or an
     organization that has a training department), or may be an independent service
     provider (e.g. for providing individual electronic learning). It should be understood
     that a course is not limited to formal courses offered by formal educational
     institutions. The course may include any form of learning instruction offered by an
25   entity of any type. For example, the course may be a training seminar at a
     company for a small group of employees or a professional certification program
     with a larger number of intended participants (e.g. PMP, CMA, etc.).
     [0076]          In some embodiments, one or more educational groups can be
     defined that includes one or more of the users 12, 14. For example, as shown in
30   Figure 1, the users 12, 14 may be grouped together in an educational group 16

                                                - 11
         representative of a particular course (e.g. History 101, French 254), with a first
         user 12 or "instructor" being responsible for providing the course (e.g. organizing
        lectures, preparing assignments, creating educational content etc), while the
        other users 14 or "learners" are consumers of the course content (e.g. users 14
   5    are enrolled in the course).
        [0077]          In some examples, the users 12, 14 may be associated with more
        than one educational group (e.g. the users 14 may be enrolled in more than one
        course, the first user may be enrolled in at least one course and is responsible
        for teaching at least one other course, or the first user 12 may be responsible for
 10    teaching more than one courses).
       [0078]           In some embodiments, educational sub-groups may also be
       formed. For example, two of the users 14 are shown as part of educational sub
       group 18. The sub-group 18 may be formed in relation to a particular project or
       assignment (e.g. sub-group 18 may be a lab group) or based on other criteria. In
 15    some embodiments, due to the nature of the electronic learning, the users 14 in a
       particular sub-group 18 need not physically meet, but may collaborate together
       using various tools provided by the educational service provider 30.
       [0079]          In some embodiments, other groups 16 and sub-groups 18 could
      include users 14 that share common interests (e.g. interests in a particular sport),
20    that participate in common activities (e.g. users that are members of a choir or a
      club), and/or have similar attributes (e.g. users that are male, users under
      twenty-one years of age, etc.).
      [0080]          Communication between the users 12, 14 and the educational
      service provider 30 can occur either directly or indirectly using any suitable
25    computing device. For example, the user 12 may use a computing device 20
      such as a desktop computer that has at least one input device (e.g. a keyboard
      and a mouse) and at least one output device (e.g. a display screen and
     speakers).
     [0081]           The computing device 20 can generally be any suitable device for
30   facilitating communication between the users 12, 14 and the educational service

                                              -12
        provider 30. For example, the computing device 20 could be a laptop 20a
        wirelessly coupled to an access point 22 (e.g. a wireless router, a cellular
        communications tower, etc.), a wirelessly enabled personal data assistant (PDA)
        20b or smart phone, a terminal 20c, a tablet computer 20d, or a game console
   5    20e over a wired connection 23.
        [0082]         The computing devices 20 may be connected to the service
       provider 30 via any suitable communications channel. For example, the
       computing devices 20 may communicate to the educational service provider 30
       over a local area network (LAN) or intranet, or using an external network (e.g. by
 10    using a browser on the computing device 20 to browse to one or more web
       pages presented over the Internet 28 over a data connection 27).
       [0083]         In some examples, one or more of the users 12, 14 may be
       required to authenticate their identities in order to communicate with the
      educational service provider 30. For example, the users 12, 14 may be required
 15   to input a login name and/or a password or otherwise identify themselves to gain
      access to the system 10.
      [0084]          In some examples, one or more users (e.g. "guest" users) may be
      able to access the system without authentication. Such guest users may be
      provided with limited access, such as the ability to review one or more
20    components of the course, for example, to decide whether they would like to
      participate in the course.
      [0085]         In some embodiments, the wireless access points 22 may connect
      to the educational service provider 30 through a data connection 25 established
      over the LAN or intranet. Alternatively, the wireless access points 22 may be in
25   communication with the educational service provider 30 via the Internet 28 or
     another external data communications network. For example, one user 14 may
     use a laptop 20a to browse to a webpage that displays elements of an electronic
     learning system (e.g. a course page).
     [0086]          The educational service provider 30 generally includes a number of
30   functional components for facilitating the provision of social electronic learning

                                             -13
      services. For example, the educational service provider 30 generally includes
      one or more processing devices 32 (e.g. servers), each having one or more
      processors. The processing devices 32 are configured to send information (e.g.
      HTML or other data) to be displayed on one or more computing devices 20 in
  5  association with the social electronic learning system           10 (e.g.   course
      information). In some embodiments, a processing device 32 may be a computing
     device 20 (e.g. a laptop or personal computer).
     [0087]          The educational service provider 30 also generally includes one or
     more data storage devices 34 (e.g. memory, etc.) that are in communication with
 10  the processing devices 32, and could include a relational database (such as a
     SQL database), or other suitable data storage devices. The data storage devices
     34 are configured to host data 35 about the courses offered by the service
     provider (e.g. the course frameworks, educational materials to be consumed by
     the users 14, records of assessments done by users 14, etc.) as will be
 15  described below.
     [0088]         The data storage devices 34 may also store authorization criteria
    that define what actions may be taken by the users 12, 14. In some
    embodiments, the authorization criteria may include at least one security profile
    associated with at least one role. For example, one role could be defined for
20  users who are primarily responsible for developing an educational course,
    teaching it, and assessing work product from other users for that course. Users
    with such a role may have a security profile that allows them to configure various
    components of the course, post assignments, add assessments, evaluate
    performance, and so on.
25  [0089]          In some embodiments, some of the authorization criteria may be
    defined by specific users 40 who may or may not be part of the educational
    community 16. For example, users 40 may be permitted to administer and /or
    define global configuration profiles for the system 10, define roles within the
    system 10, set security profiles associated with the roles, and assign the roles to
30  particular users 12, 14 in the system 10. In some embodiments, the users 40

                                              - 14
       may use another computing device (e.g. a desktop computer 42) to accomplish
       these tasks.
       [0090]         The data storage devices 34 may also be configured to store other
       information, such as personal information about the users 12, 14 of the system
  5    10, information about which courses the users 14 are enrolled in, roles to which
      the users 12, 14 are assigned, particular interests of the users 12, 14 and so on.
      [0091]          The processing devices 32 and data storage devices 34 may also
      provide other electronic learning management tools (e.g. allowing users to add
      and drop courses, communicate with other users using chat software, etc.),
 10   and/or may be in communication with one or more other vendors that provide the
      tools.
      [0092]          In some embodiments, the system 10 may also have one or more
      backup servers 31 that may duplicate some or all of the data 35 stored on the
     data storage devices 34. The backup servers 31 may be desirable for disaster
15    recovery (e.g. to prevent undesired data loss in the event of an event such as a
     fire, flooding, or theft).
     [0093]          In some embodiments, the backup servers 31 may be directly
     connected to the educational service provider 30 but located within the system
     10 at a different physical location. For example, the backup servers 31 could be
20   located at a remote storage location at a distance from the service provider 30,
     and the service provider 30 could connect to the backup server 31 using a
    secure communications protocol to ensure that the confidentiality of the data 35
     is maintained.
    [0094]           Turning now to Figure 2, illustrated therein is a method 50 of
25  providing guided instructional design according to one embodiment. For
    example, in some embodiments, the method 50 may be provided using the
    system of Figure 1.
    [0095]          At step 52, a first user (e.g. a user 12) desiring to generate a
    course will activate a course design module (e.g. a course wizard or module,

                                              -15
       such as the modules 100 and 200 described below). Generally the course design
       module will be operating on one or more processing devices, which could be a
      server (e.g. server 32) as well as computing devices 20.
      [0096]         At step 54, the course design module presents the user with one or
  5   more course components. Course components are generally broad "functions"
      that describe the various aspects of the course within the framework that can be
      configured,    such   as    course  information,     competencies,    course  goals,
      assessments, materials, etc. In some embodiments, the course components can
      be considered as including broad components (e.g. course info) and narrower
 10  sub-components (e.g. basic course information, instructor info, course duration,
     etc.) that fall under the heading of a broader course component. The user, for
     example, may be an instructor or any other user that contributes to developing
     the course.
     [0097]         At step 56, for each course parameter is presented for each course
15   component. Course parameters are individual educational elements within the
     course components, and can include natural language objects and controls, as
    will be described in greater detail below.
     [0098]         At step 58, the course design module receives at least one first
    input in relation to at least one of the course parameters from a first user (e.g.
20  user 12). For example, the user may input a title for the course, input educational
    materials (e.g. slides, readings, audio recordings), select course competencies
    and objectives, etc. which the user desires to include as part of the customized
    course framework.
    [0099]          At step 60, in response to the first inputs received from the user, as
25  well as from educational design elements (see box 62) (e.g. predefined
    educational theory components, decision trees for the system 10) the course
    design module then generates and presents at least one modified course
    parameters. For example a modified course parameter could be a suggestion
    about a particular course structure the user may wish to take, a presentation of a

                                               -16
       predefined list of course objectives or competencies based on previously
       received input (e.g. the first inputs).
       [00100]       At step 64, the course design module receives at least one second
       input associated with the modified course parameter from the first user. For
  5   example, the user may select a particular course objective from a list presented
      at step 62. In some embodiments, for example, where there are additional course
      components to review, the method 50 can return from step 64 back to step 54,
      where a different course component can be presented. In other embodiments,
      the method 50 can proceed from step 64 to step 66.
 10   [00101]       At step 66, the system (e.g. system 10) generates a customized
      course framework based on the first and second inputs received from the first
      user. In some embodiments, where the customized course framework has
     already been generated, the system may alternatively modify the customized
     course framework.
 15  [00102]        At step 68, the course framework may be presented to a second
     user (e.g. users 12 who are participating in the course). This may be in response
     to a request from the second user to access his or her course information, for
     example.
     [00103]        Turning now to Figure 3, a screenshot of a welcome page 101 for a
20   course design module 100 for a system for providing guided instructional design
     is shown according to one embodiment. For example, the course design module
     100 may be provided using the system 10 generally as described above.
     [00104]        When the user (e.g. first user 12) initiates the course design
     module 100, one or more course components may be presented to the user in
25   relation to the particular course being designed. Each course component also
     includes one or more course parameters, which are elements of the various
    course components and which may guide the user through the course design
    process (e.g. using natural language elements), and will respond dynamically to
    inputs from the user in order to generate and/or modify a customized course
30  framework for that course.

                                                -17
        [00105]        In particular, the course parameters may provide guidance to the
        user in selecting and arranging various elements for the course. Normally, the
        course parameters include objects (e.g. text) presented to the user in a plain or
        natural language format using terminology that will be familiar to the user. For
   5    example, the natural language may include terms selected from known
       educational terms (e.g. terms taken from Bloom's educational taxonomy, etc.)
        [00106]       The course parameters may also include one or simpler graphical
       user interface (GUI) controls (e.g. text boxes, radio buttons, check boxes,
       dropdown lists, etc.) for receiving input from the user in association with some of
  10   the natural language objects.
       [00107]        By using a combination of natural language objects and simple
       controls, the user (who will often have limited programming or other computer
      skills) can select desired course elements (e.g. course competencies, objectives,
      modules, learning materials, etc.) that can then be used to generate a
 15   customized course framework.
      [00108]         Returning again to Figure 3, the welcome page 101 (and other
      pages) of the course design module 100 may be presented as one or more
      webpages that may be accessed using a web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer,
      Firefox, Safari, Chrome, etc.) using one or more computing devices 20. For
 20   example, as shown, the welcome page 101 is presented as a webpage that
      includes a plurality of display areas (e.g. one or more frames).
      [00109]        As shown, the welcome page 101 can include one or more text
      areas 102 (which may include some introductory remarks, information that may
      assist the user 12 in preparing a particular course, etc.). The welcome page 101
25   also include controls such as "start" button 104, which initiates the course design
     module 100 (and may activate the chose competencies page 110 shown in
     Figure 4).
     [00110]         In some embodiments, the welcome page 101 may require the user
     to authenticate him or herself (e.g. using a login name and password) to navigate
30   through the course design module 100.

                                               - 18
      [00111]       The sequence of the course design module 100 can vary greatly,
      but in some embodiments the first page that is displayed after the welcome page
      is a choose competencies page 110 (as shown in Figure 4).
      [00112]       In this embodiment, the choose competencies page 110 includes a
  5   progress indicator area 112 provided on a left side of the page 110, and one or
      more content areas 122, 124, 126 provided on a right side of the page 110. It will
      be understood, however, that the particular position and size of the areas on the
     webpage may be generally varied and is shown only here according to one
     exemplary configuration.
 10  [00113]        The progress indicator area 112 may show some or all of the
     course components for the particular course that the user is generating. The
     progress indicator area 112 may also be modified as the user moves through the
     course design module 100 (e.g. the list of items in the progress indicator 112
     area may dynamically change as course competencies are added, for example).
 15  [00114]        Each course component is normally presented using natural
     language that the user would be familiar with and/or capable of understanding.
     For example, in this embodiment, the progress indicator area 112 lists four board
    course components: define learning goals 114, choose learning activities 116,
    create learning segments 118, and configure assessment 120. These four course
20  components have natural language identifiers that use terms               based in
    educational theory and would be familiar to some if not most users of the learning
    system 10.
    [00115]        The progress indicator area 112 may also show the relative location
    of the user as the user navigates through the course design module 100. For
25  example, as shown in Figure 4, the active course component (or sub-component)
    is highlighted. In this figure, the course sub-component is "choose competencies"
    114a (which is a sub-component of the defined learning goals 114 component).
    The term "choose competencies" 114a is also displayed as the title of the page
    110 within the content area 122.

                                             -19
      [00116]       As shown, each of the content areas 122, 124, 126 may include
      one or more course parameters that may include one or more natural language
      objects and one or more controls.
      [00117]       As discussed above, the course parameters are presented to guide
  5   the user through the course design process, and can assist the user by
      prompting the user for specific inputs (e.g. text inputs, decisions, etc.) associated
     with specific language objects. Based on those inputs the system can then
     generate a customized framework for that course. In some embodiments, the
     course parameters may be adapted to assist the user in designing a generally
 10  pedagogically sound course.
     [00118]        Previous inputs may also be used to modify or generate new
     course parameters that are presented to the user. For example, as shown in
     Figure 4, the first content area 122 includes a first course parameter with a
     control (e.g. a search box) that allows the user to search for course
 15  competencies. For example, the user can input one or more keywords into the
     search box and then activate the search by activating a control, such as the
     "search" button shown. In some instances, the search box may allow for
     advanced search options (e.g. Boolean searching, etc.).
     [00119]       Generally, course competencies are broad goals for the course,
20   and could include standardized competencies, such as prerequisites for taking
    the course (e.g. course participants are expected to have satisfied US high
    school level biology requirements), as well as desired post-course competencies
    (e.g. the course participants must meet specific standards for grade schools as
    defined by a state or other government entity, the participants must have an
25  understanding of biology at a first year university level, etc.). The term "course
    competencies" is a natural language term based on educational theory that will
    be understood by the user.
    [00120]        In this embodiments, the results of the search conducted using the
    first content area 122 can then be displayed in a second content area 124 as
30  another course parameter (e.g. a list of user-selectable course competencies).

                                               - 20
       [00121]        In some embodiments, the list may be generated from a predefined
      data set, which may be stored in one or more of the data storage devices 34. The
      predefined data set may be predefined by another user (e.g. user 40), by an
      organization, or by the first user (e.g. user 14).
  5   [00122]         As shown, the list may also display some predefined properties for
      each competency, such as the name, status (e.g. approved by the educational
      institution, pending approval, draft for submission, etc.), and a description about
      the competency (and/or a link to more information).
      [00123]         The list may also include a control (e.g. an "add" button) for each
 10  particular competency. For example, by selecting the "add" button, the user can
     choose to add one or more competencies to the course. In some embodiments,
     some competencies may be automatically added, for example where they are
     mandatory (e.g., required by an organization that governs accreditation, required
     by an organization's administration, etc.) for a particular course.
 15  [00124]          On the choose competencies page 110 the third content area 126
     shows another course parameter, which is a list of the currently selected course
     competencies. In some embodiments, the user may be able to delete
    competencies from this list using another control (e.g. by selecting a trash icon).
     [00125]         Generally, the choose competencies page 110 of the course design
20  module 100 can assist the user in finding potential competencies from predefined
    data (e.g. the user can use keywords to find competencies), presents the results
    so they can be reviewed by the user, and then allows desired competencies to
    be added. The use of natural language (e.g. including educational theory terms),
    simple controls (e.g. search boxes, buttons, etc.), and dynamic parameters (e.g.
25  search results) that respond to user inputs will be intuitive to most users and will
    tend to make it easy for the users to design particular components of the course.
    [00126]          In some embodiments, one more of the pages (e.g. the choose
    competencies page 110) may include a progress bar 123 that indicates a
    percentage of the course design process that has been completed.

                                              - 21
       [00127]        In some instances, the user may not find a desired competency on
      the choose competencies page 110. For example, the predefined competency
      list may not have a particular competency being searched for. Accordingly, the
      user may wish to create customized course competencies for this course. The
  5   user can then proceed to an add competencies page 129 as shown in Figure 5.
      In this figure, the active course sub-component is "add competencies" 114b, as
      highlighted in the progress indicator area 112 and listed as the title of the page
      129.
      [00128]        The add competencies page 129 includes a first content area 130
 10  which can include natural language objects (e.g. text and other information)
     which may be useful in explaining to the user how a course competency may be
     created. The first content area 130 may also include links to more information or
     examples, which can be useful if the user desires more information, such as from
     an external webpage or another page within the course design module 100.
 15  [00129]         The add competencies page 129 also includes a second content
     area 132 with course parameters related to adding a new competency. For
     example, the second content area 132 prompts the user to enter text information
     (such as a title and a description for the new competency) using various controls,
     and then allows the user to add the competency to that course using another
20   control (e.g. an "add" button). The user may also be presented with a control to
     select a template for creating the new competency (for example, an existing
     competency may be used as a template).
     [00130]         The current list of competencies for the course is shown in a third
    content area 134, which can dynamically respond to the inputs (e.g. text inputs
25  and selections) of the user.
    [00131]         Turning now to Figure 6, once the user has added the desired
    competencies to the course, the user can navigate to a choose course objective
    page 135. In this figure, the active course sub-component is "choose objectives"
    114c, as highlighted in the progress indicator area 112 and listed as the page
30  title.

                                             - 22
      [00132]       Generally speaking, course objectives are more narrowly defined
      goals that are associated with particular course competencies. For example,
      course objectives may include performance           skills, behavioral objectives,
      performance objectives and knowledge development objectives. For instance, in
  5   a biology course, a course competency could include "understand basic plant
      biology", course objectives could include the participants performing laboratory
      experiments, classifying plants and animals, and describe the ecological role of
     fungi.
      [00133]       On the choose course objectives page 135, a first content area 136
 10  displays course parameters that include a list of course objectives presenting in a
     natural language format, and button control for adding each objective to the
     course.
     [00134]        In some embodiments, the list of course objectives may be stored
     in one or more data storage devices 34, and may be generated based on one or
 15  more competencies that were previously selected by the user (e.g. using the
     choose competencies page 110). For example, for each particular course
     competency, the choose objectives page 135 may suggest certain course
    objectives based on a previous user inputs and educational design elements
     (e.g. aspects of educational theory, historical design information, etc.), and then
20  allow the user to select the desired objectives from the suggested lists.
    [00135]        On this page 135, the selected course objectives for each particular
    course competency are displayed within a second content area 138.
    [00136]        Turning now to Figure 7, after the course objectives have been
    selected, the user may then navigate to a classify objectives page 139. In this
25  figure, the active course sub-component is "classify objectives" 114d, as
    highlighted in the progress indicator area 112 and listed as the page title.
    [00137]        Various learning objectives can vary in complexity and type, and it
    may be desirable to provide a mixture of different types of objectives. For
    example, according to some educational theories course objectives can be

                                               -23
       grouped     into   different categories     or   levels,  such    as    "knowledge",
       "comprehension", "application", "analysis", "synthesis", and "evaluation".
       [00138]        As shown in Figure 7, a first content area 140 may provide
       information about the various categories of objectives in natural language familiar
   5   to the user. The second content area 142 on the other hand may include simple
       controls  that    allow the   user to     associate   previously selected     course
       competencies (e.g. the course competencies listed in the content area 138 in
       Figure 6) with particular educational levels or categories (e.g. knowledge,
      comprehension, etc.), for example using a dropdown list.
 10   [00139]         In some embodiments, the course objectives (e.g. as shown in
      content area 136) may not satisfy all the course objectives desired by the user.
      Accordingly, an add objectives page 145 for the course design module 100 may
      be presented to the user, as shown in Figure 8. In this figure, the active course
      sub-component is "add objectives" 114e, as highlighted in the progress indicator
 15   area 112 and listed as the page title.
      [00140]        As shown, a first content area 146 may include text and other items
     that provide the user with guidance about adding a new course objective. For
     example, the content area 146 may include natural language terms that explain
     what makes a "good objective" as well as definitions of terms for the user to
20   review, which could be based on educational theories.
     [00141]         The second content area 148 includes course parameters related
     to adding a course objective. For example, as shown the user is prompted to
     provide a title for the course objective in a text box control, select a suitable level
     or category (e.g. knowledge, comprehension, etc.) from a dropdown list control,
25   enter a description in another text box control, and select a competency which
     the new objective will be attached to (e.g. one of the previously defined
     competencies) using another dropdown list. The new objective can then be
     added to the course using an "add" button.
     [00142]         On this page 145, a third content area 150 lists the current course
30   competencies and selected course objectives for the competencies.

                                               - 24
        [00143]        Turning now to Figure 9, the user may be presented with a learning
        activities objectives page 151 for adding one or more activities to each of the
       course objectives. In this figure, another broad course component (e.g. choose
       learning activities 116) is presented to the user via one or more sub-components.
   5   For example, the active course sub-component is "Objective Name 1" 116a, as
       highlighted in the progress indicator area 112 and listed as the page title, which
       corresponds to the first objective selected using the choose objectives page 135.
       [00144]         This page includes a first content area 152 which can include
       course parameters, such as natural language text about things the user should
 10   consider when defining activities 153, radio button controls 154 for selecting
      particular activity types (e.g. whether the course participants should be
      independent, work as a group, or experiment and discover), and a button control
       155 for suggesting activities given the inputs of the user in combination with
      education design elements (e.g. educational theories, educational taxonomies,
 15   etc.).
      [00145]         For example, suggested activities may be displayed on a select
      common activities page 157 as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the active sub
      component is "Select Common Activities" 11 6b.
      [00146]         The select common activities page 157 allows one or more
20   activities to be associated with the previously defined course objectives. For
     example, in a biology course, suppose that one of the course objectives includes
     the requirement that course participants be able to perform basic biology
     laboratory experiments. Using the page 157 shown in Figure 10, the user could
     then select suitable activities for reaching that course objective, such as:
25   reviewing lab equipment to learn equipment names, preparing an experiment
     plan with group, conducting the experiment, and preparing a report about the
     experiment.
     [00147]          The suggested activities can be displayed in a first content area
     156, where the activities may be explained in plain language and possibly
30   organized using tabs 162. The user may select particular options for each activity

                                               - 25
       using controls provided in a second content area 158. In some embodiments, a
      third content area 160 may display one or more assessments that can be
      associated with the particular activities.
      [00148]        Generally, the learning activities page 151 and select common
  5   activities page 157 may be displayed for each of the previously selected course
      objectives so that the desired course framework can be developed.
      [00149]        Turning now to Figure 11, for some activities the user may desire to
      organize the participants into groups (e.g. users 14 may be organized into a
      group 18). If so, the create groups page 169 may be displayed. On this figure,
 10  the sub-component "create groups" 118a of the course component create
      learning segments 118 is active.
     [00150]        The create groups page 169 can be used to define group options
     (e.g. the number of users in each group, whether the users can create their own
     groups or have groups randomly assigned, whether the same groups are to be
 15  used for multiple activities, etc.) using course parameters providing in various
     content areas.
     [00151]        For example, as shown three content areas 170, 172, 174 are
     presented for three activities. The first content area 170 presents course
     parameters for a first activity including natural language objects, and allows
20   group options to be selected using controls. The second and third content areas
     172, 174 allow previously defined groups to be used or a new group to be
    created for each of the activities.
    [00152]         Turning now to Figure 12, the next step in the course design
    module 100 may be to define educational modules using a define modules page
25  175. Generally, each educational module may be a functional group of one or
    more of the previously defined course objectives (e.g. an educational unit or
    topic) which defines how the course is to be organized. For example, in a math
    course, educational modules could be topics such as: fractions, addition,
    multiplication, exponents, etc.

                                                - 26
         [00153]       As shown, various course parameters can be displayed in a content
         area 176, and include controls that allow the user to select modules for each of
        the previously defined course objectives (e.g. using radio buttons and dropdown
         lists).
   5    [00154]        Turning now to Figure 13, once the course modules have been
        defined, these can be displayed as parameters on a course sequence page 179.
        The course sequence page 179 can include a plurality of language objects and
        controls for creating a temporal structure to the course. This may include making
        the course self-paced or defining specific start and end dates, associating the
 10    course with calendar days or months, and determining the number of sessions
       per week (as shown in the first content area 180), as well as assigning time or
       sessions for each of the previously defined educational modules.
       [00155]         Turning now to Figure 14, the next step in the course design
       module 100 may be to present the user with a select grading system page 183.
 15    In this figure, another broad course component (e.g. configure assessment 120)
       is presented to the user, with the course sub-component "select grading system"
       120a being active.
      [00156]         On this page 183, the user can select one or more grading systems
      for the course based on the displayed course parameters displayed in content
 20   areas 184, 186 (which could include suggesting proposed course grading
      systems as natural language objects and presenting controls such as radio
      buttons and checkboxes for selecting the desired grading system).
      [00157]         Once the grading system has been selected, the assessment
      schedule can be determined using as assessment schedule page 189 as shown
25    in Figure 15. In this figure, the active sub-component is "create test schedule".
     This page 189 may present course parameters including natural language
     information about various types of tests (e.g. progress tests and comprehensive
     tests) displayed in a first content area 190, controls for adding a test in a second
     content area 191, and a course sequence displayed in a third content area 192
30   (and including one or more test events 193 therein).

                                              -27
       [00158]        In some embodiments, the natural language information or objects
       may be based on educational theory. For example, information as to whether a
       certain type of assessment (e.g. a multiple choice exam) is appropriate for
       particular subject matter (e.g. math courses) may be presented.
  5    [00159]       The next step in the course design module 100 may be to
      categorize grades using a categorize grades page as shown in Figure 16. The
      active sub-component in this figure is "categorize grades" 120c.
      [00160]        Using the categorize grades page 195, the user can categorize the
      graded items (e.g. assignments, etc.) as they should appear in a grades tool, for
 10   example. Course parameters may be presented in a content area and include a
      list of the modules and activities, as well as tests, and may allow the user to
      intuitively categorize the graded items for those activities and tests (in some
      cases using predefined categories or by allowing the user to generate new
     categories).
 15  [00161]         Finally, as shown on Figure 17, in some embodiments the user may
     be presented with the option to assign weights for the different activities using an
     assign weights page 197. For example, the previously defined categories and
     activities may be presented along with various controls (e.g. text boxes,
     checkboxes, etc.) for selecting the desired weights.
20   [00162]         The course design module 100 is now complete, and the user can
     be presented with a completion page as shown in Figure 18. The completion
     page may include a summary of the actions taken in designing the course, and
     may also allow the user to re-enter the course design module 100 to make
    changes, edit various course parameters, etc.
25  [00163]         The course design module 100 can now generate a customized
    course framework for this course. The course framework can incorporate all of
    the various elements (e.g. competencies, objectives, activities, assessments,
    etc.) as based on the inputs from the user at the various stages of the course
    design module as well as educational design elements (e.g. educational theories,

                                            -28
      decision matrices for particular educational institutions, historical information,
      etc.).
      [00164]      At this point the user may be free to assign content and
      assessments to the framework provided with confidence that they are following
  5   educational "best-practices". In some embodiments, the user may assign content
      and assessments via a "drag-n-drop"" interface to take their specific materials
      and align them to the objectives and activities that they set out using the course
     design module 100.
     [00165]       Turning now Figure 19, illustrated therein is a course design
 10  module 200 (or "course design wizard") according to yet another embodiment.
     [00166]       Generally, the course design module 200 is similar to the course
     design module 100, and presents course parameters for the user, receives inputs
     from the user in association with those course parameters, and then repeatedly
     presents new or modified course parameters based on those inputs until the
15   course design is completed. Once complete, the course design module 200 can
     generate a customized course framework that incorporates the various elements
     selected and organized by the user.
     [00167]       For example, the course design module 200 includes a course info
    page 201, which may be the first page displayed to the user. The various pages
20  (including the course info page 201) may display various course components 202
    (e.g. goals, context, objectives, assessments, strategies, materials, etc.), with the
    currently active component highlighted (e.g. "course info" 202a).
    [00168]        Various sub-components for each component may also be listed,
    where applicable. For example, in this embodiment the sub-components 206 are
25  listed and a "course info" sub-component 206a is active.
    [00169]        The course info page 201 can display course parameters in a
    content area 204. As with the course design module 100 above, the course
    parameters can generally include information presented to the user as natural
    language objects (e.g. text, which may or may not be rooted in educational

                                              - 29
      theories and taxonomies), as well as controls for receiving inputs from the user in
      association with the natural language objects.
      [00170]         For example, as shown in Figure 19 the user could be prompted to
      input text information about the course name, description and location using text
  5   field controls, select department, course type and level from dropdown lists.
      [00171]        Various controls can also be used to navigate through the various
      pages of the course design module 200 (e.g. buttons for "Next", "Previous",
     "Save & Exit Wizard", etc.).
     [00172]         Turning now to Figure 20, an instructor info page 207 of the course
 10  design module 200 may be the next screen presented to the user (with the
     "instructor info" 206b sub-component being active). This page 207 may prompt
     the user to input information about the instructor, such as name, email address,
     office information, and office hours using text fields.
     [00173]         The user may also be able to associate other users (e.g. teaching
 15  assistants, lab technicians, etc.) with the course. These added users may be
     displayed as a list that is dynamically updated in response to the user inputs.
     [00174]         Turning now to Figure 21, the next page in the course design
    module 200 may be a course duration page 209, which may allow the user to
    select start and end dates for the course using various controls shown in the
20  content area 210. The "duration" 206c sub-component is highlighted as being
    active in this Figure.
    [00175]          The next page in the course design module 200 may be a course
    sharing page 211 as shown in Figure 22 (with "sharing" 206d highlighted as the
    active sub-component).
25  [00176]          The sharing page 211 may allow the user to share all or parts of the
    course and/or its components within a learning repository where it can be
    accessed by other users who are creating courses. For example, a content area
    212 may provide various controls for allowing the user to select whether to share

                                               - 30
        the entire course, everything except the course content, or just the structure of
        the course.
        [00177]       Turning now to Figure 23, a goals 206b course component is
        presented on an instructional goals page 215 (with "instructional goals" 214a
   5    highlighted as the active sub-component 214 of the broad component "context").
        The goals page 215 may allow the user to add broad goals for the course,
        including adding course pre-requisites using natural language objects and
       controls as shown in the first content area 216 (e.g. course participants must
       have completed high school biology with a 75% minimum average, must have
 10    attended a lab orientation session, etc.) and instructional goals using natural
       language objects and controls shown in the second content area 218 (e.g.
       "Biology 1001 seeks to provide participants with the skills to move on to a second
       year biology course").
       [00178]       The user can then also add one or more course competencies,
 15    using the course competencies page 219 shown in Figure 24 (with
      "competencies" 214b highlighted as the active sub-component 214). For
      example, pre-course competency requirements can be added using controls in a
      first content area 220 (e.g. the participants must have completed high school
      biology and high school science), while desired post-course competencies can
20    be added using controls in a second content area 222 (e.g. participants must
      understand first year science concepts).
      [00179]        Next, the user may be presented with a learner characteristics page
     223 as shown in Figure 25 (with "learners" 224a highlighted as the active sub
     components 224). This page 223 may allow the user to define the general
25   characteristics of the participants in the course as presented in the content area
     226, which may be used to modify subsequent course parameters that are
     presented to the user. For example, the course parameters for this course
     component could include prompting the user to identify elements such as
     industry sector (e.g. higher education, corporate learning, personal study, etc.),

                                              - 31
       the type of degree offered (e.g. science, arts, etc.) as well as define a typical
       participant or learner persona.
       [00180]        In Figure 26, various elements of the learning context course
       component 202c may be further developed using an instructional setting page
  5    225 (with "setting" highlighted as the active sub-component 224). For example,
      course parameters related to the course time frame may be presented in a first
      content area 227 (e.g. is this a single semester course, a self-guided study
      course with or without a time limit, etc.), while course parameters related to the
      instructional setting may be presented in a second content area 228 (e.g. is the
 10   course an online-only course, a classroom only course, or a blend).
      [00181]        Turning now to Figure 27 a learning objectives page 229 for the
      course component "objectives" 202d can be presented. The user can use the
      objectives page 229 to add and/or remove learning objectives for the particular
      course,    which    can   include  performance     skills, behavioural objectives,
 15   performance objects, knowledge development objectives, etc. For example, one
     objective could be to recognize and identify basic laboratory equipment. These
     course parameters could include natural language objects (e.g. text) and controls
     (e.g. add or remove buttons) presented in a first content area 230.
     [00182]         Once the learning objectives have been identified, a course
20   assessment page 231 may be used to add assessments for the course, and (as
     shown in Figure 28) for the course component "assessment" 202e.
     [00183]         The assessment course parameters could include course rubrics as
     shown in the first content area 232 (e.g. standard science department rubrics,
     provincial or state-wide rubrics) and selecting a grading system using a second
25   content area 234 (e.g. weighted, points, formula, or no grading).
     [00184]         The next steps in the course design module 200 could include
    pages covering a "strategy" 202f course component. For example, Figure 29
    shows a course structure page 237 where parameters related to the course
    structure can be displayed in a content area 238 (with "structure" 236a listed as
30  the active sub-component 236). In some embodiments, the content area 238

                                              - 32
      may include a suggestion 239 to the user based on previously received user
      information. For example, the course design module 200 may suggest that the
      user select a "science" course structure, and may actually place this suggestion
      as the default entry in one of the controls 241. The user can then use the controls
  5   241 to select this suggestion or make another selection.
      [00185]        Figure 30 shows a course sequence page 243 for the "strategy"
      202f course component, which allows the user to modify course parameters
      related to the "sequencing" 236b sub-component of the course. For example, the
      user can use control in the content area 240 to select a sequence based on
 10  timeline, subject matter, or competencies, as well as define course units.
     [00186]         Furthermore, using a course components page 245 shown in
     Figure 31, the user may be presented with suggestions 242 for educational
     components and features to be added to the course (e.g. one or more of a blog,
     discussion, dropbox, FAQ, etc.), and which may be presented in a content area
 15  247 so that they may be selected or deselected by the user.
     [00187]        Turning now to Figure 32, a locate materials page 249 for the
     course component "develop materials" 202g is shown (with "locate materials"
     244a highlighted as the active sub-component 244). The locate materials page
     249 will allow the user to input course materials (e.g. handouts, slides, audio
20   recording, readings, etc.) that have been prepared for use with the course. The
    course materials may be selected by using a first content area 246 to browse a
    file system to locate files (which could be on a local drive or on a network). The
    user can then select particular files and add them to the course materials list as
    shown in the second content area 248.
25  [00188]         In some embodiments, the next step will be to provide additional
    materials using a define additional materials page 251 as shown in Figure 33
    (with "additional materials" 244b identified as the active sub-component 244). For
    example, natural language objects and controls in a content area 250 can allow
    the user to identify additional instructional materials to be created, define tasks
30  (e.g. create lecture #1 slides), and set deadlines for completion.

                                              - 33
       [00189]       In some embodiments, the next step is to define course review
      components 202h, for example using a course review page 253 as shown in
      Figure 34. Using this page 253, the user can add one or more users to review the
      course that is being created (e.g. using controls in a content area 252), which
  5   may be helpful in ensuring that the user creates a course that meets the
      requirements of the particular educational institution.
      [00190]        Turning now to Figure 35, the user has completed the course
      design module 200 and is presented with a completion screen 255 (with "finish"
      listed as the active course component). Using controls in the content area 254,
 10  the user can then choose to take actions such as previewing the course, editing
     the course using the course design module 200 or another application, etc.
     [00191]         The course design       module 200 can therefore      generate a
     customized course framework that is based on the course parameters presented
     to the user and the inputs received from the user.
15   [00192]        Turning now to Figure 36, illustrated therein is a course builder
     module 300 for displaying customized course framework information 304
     according to one embodiment. As the course builder module may include a menu
     area 302, which may allow one or more users to take various actions with
     respect to the customized course framework 304, such as add content (e.g. files,
20  web objects, etc.), add assessment (e.g. learning objectives, rubrics, quizzes,
    etc.) and add project objects (e.g. tasks, resources, etc.).
     [00193]        As shown, the course framework 304 is generally presented as a
    tree structure, as will be described in detail below.
    [00194]         Figure 37 is a detail view of the course framework 304 according to
25  one embodiment, labeled generally as 304a.
    [00195]         In this embodiment the course framework 304a includes a course
    title 306 (e.g. Biology 1001), a plurality of units 308a, 308b, 308c, and a final
    exam 310. Each unit 308a, 308b, 308c may include sub-elements. For example,

                                                   - 34
        the first unit includes two instructional elements 312a (labeled "introduction to
        science") and 312b (labeled "biology concepts), and an assessment 314.
        [00196]         The first instructional element 312a includes reading materials 316,
        and two learning objects 318, namely "identify lab equipment" 318a and "follow
   5    the scientific method" 318b.
        [00197]        The second instructional element 312b includes a placeholder for
        reading materials 317 (and which may be populated with actual reading material
       content at a later time).
       [00198]         The assessment 317 also includes a placeholder for a quiz 319.
 10    [00199]         The final exam 310 includes two placeholders for a quiz 319 and for
       study materials 321.
       [00200]         By presenting the customized course framework 304 in this
       manner, users can quickly grasp the overall structure of the course, which may
       be useful in organizing the course material and identifying materials that still
 15   need to be created. For example, in some embodiments, the placeholders can be
      populated with elements using the course builder 300, and/or one of the course
      design modules 100, 200 identified above.
      [00201]          The course framework 304 may also be presented in different ways
      to facilitate understanding of the course structure. For example, as shown in
20    Figure 38 the course framework 304 for the same course may be shown
     according to another embodiment labeled generally as 304b.
     [00202]          In this embodiment, the customized course framework 304b is
     presented in a generally chronological order, with four weeks 320a, 320b, 320c,
     and 320d being identified. Each week 320a, 320b, 320c, 320d can have one or
25   more educational elements associated therewith.
     [00203]          For example, the first week 320a includes a first lecture 322a and a
     second lecture 322b. The first lecture 322a includes slides 324a, a handout 324b
     and a group activity 324c associated therewith.

                                               - 35
        [00204]       The second lecture 322b has placeholders for slides 323 and a quiz
       that have yet to be populated.
       [00205]        The fourth week 320d includes a mid-term exam 322c, which as
       shown includes placeholders for a quiz 319 and study materials 321 that have
   5   yet to be populated with content.
       [00206]        Figure 39 shows yet another view of the course framework 304
       indicated generally as 304c according to yet another embodiment. In this
       embodiment, the course framework 304c is presented according to course
       objectives. For example, a first course objective 326a ("Describe the concepts of
 10    Biology"), a second course objective 326b ("Identify lab equipment"), a third
       course objective 326c ("Safely use the lab equipment"), and a fourth course
      objective 326d ("Describe the principles of classification and properties of the
      cell").
      [00207]        The first course objective 326a includes general reading materials
 15   328a, and an assessment 328b. The general reading materials 328a include
      specific reading materials 330a, 330b (e.g. particular chapters in a text book) as
     well as a placeholder 317 for additional reading materials.
      [00208]        The assessment 328b includes a placeholder 319 for a quiz.
     [00209]         Generally, in some embodiments, each of the course components
20   and/or course parameters may be selected to be presented to a user based on
     educational theory. In some embodiments, educational theory may include
     research literature, expert opinions, and/or various other materials related to the
     field of teaching and knowledge acquisition more generally.
     [00210]        In some embodiments, a user providing input to one or more
25   course parameters may be presented by providing educational theory in an
     understandable format (e.g. natural language) at the point of decision by the
     user. As such, the user may consider selected relevant educational theories
     when making one or more decisions as to the selection of particular educational
     elements for the course.

                                              - 36
       [00211]       As noted above, some of the users 12, 14 may be instructors and
       some of the users 12, 14 are learners. In some embodiments, some users 12, 14
       may be both instructors and learners.
       [00212]       The description herein provides examples wherein the instructors
   5   are primarily responsible for designing one or more educational courses that are
       provided to the learners. However, it should be understood that in some
       embodiments, educational courses may be designed by users other than the
       instructor of a particular course (for instance, teaching assistants or
      administrators may also assist in designing a particular course, or courses may
 10   be designed by third party content designers or publishers).
      [00213]        In some embodiments, the instructors may receive guidance from a
      governing or accreditation institution as to one or more topics of instruction and
      competencies that a learner should have achieved after successfully completing
      a particular course. In such embodiments, the instructors may develop the
 15   course with a view to help the learners develop such competencies when the
      learner completes the course.
      [00214]        For example, a school board may require that students who has
      completed a primary school class on mathematics to be able to perform simple
      arithmetic. In such a case, the instructor may develop the course as he or she
20    sees fit, provided that the learners for that course obtain the desired
     competencies upon the successful completion of the course.
     [00215]        In particular, each educational course may have a set of
     competencies that a learner completing the course is expected to have upon
     successful completion of the course, and the competencies may differ from
25   course to course. For example, a competency for a math class may be basic
     arithmetic while a competency for a history class may require that the student be
     familiar with certain information about the civil war.
     [00216]        In some embodiments, one or more learning objectives for a course
     may be defined based on the desired competencies. Each learning objective may
30   be associated with a topic of instruction that is related to or associated with the

                                                  -37
       competencies for that course such that, if a learner meets those learning
       objectives, he or she is likely to have the desired competencies for that course.
       [00217]       In some embodiments, one or more of the learning objectives may
       be defined based on input from the instructor. In other embodiments, one or
  5    more the learning objectives may be defined without input by the instructor (for
      example, learning objectives may be developed by a governmental organization,
      accreditation facility, or an institution's administration). In some embodiments one
      or more learning objectives may be determined based on existing courses and
      suggested to the instructor.
 10   [00218]        Generally, each educational course may have a number of content
      modules and assessment modules. Each content module contains educational
      material about a particular topic. For example, a specific content module may
      include textbooks (or relevant excerpts or readings therefrom), audio recordings,
     video recordings, articles, or generally any source of information on that topic so
15   that when the content module is consumed by the learner, the learner is exposed
     to selected information about that topic (and hopefully will retain some knowledge
     about that topic).
     [00219]        Most courses also include assessment modules that are designed
     to assess the learner's knowledge about one or more given topics. For example,
20   an assessment module may include one or more quiz questions, essay topics,
     multiple-choice questions, oral assessments, and so on.
     [00220]        In some embodiments, a course may not include an assessment
     module. For example, a course may be offered on an "auditing" basis such that
     no assessment need be completed.
25  [00221]         Generally, the instructor may organize the content and assessment
    modules in various ways. For example, the instructor may design and structure
    the course such that the system 10 provides the components of the course to the
    learner in a certain order.

                                                 - 38
        [00222]          In some embodiments, a course design module may be adapted to
        help facilitate the creation of a pedagogically sound course having one or more
        pedagogically sound learning modules.
        [00223]         In some embodiments, the order of presentation or organization of
   5   the content modules and assessment modules may not necessarily be based on
       the particular learning objective. That is, the instructor may design the course
       such that an electronic learning system provides or presents the components of a
       course in some particular order and structure, and need not provide the modules
       related to a given learning objective together.
  10   [00224]         For instance, in a history class, the instructor may wish to provide
      the content modules to the learners in a generally chronological order. For
      example, a course on the civil war may be presented chronologically rather than
      on a particular learning objective basis (e.g. as opposed to organizing the course
      based on learning objective on Abraham Lincoln or the Gettysburg address).
 15   [00225]          In another example, in a mathematics class, the instructor may
      organize the content modules such that they are presented in discrete logical
      groups of increasing conceptual difficulty. For example, the instructor may wish
      to organize the course such that addition is normally taught before multiplication,
      and multiplication is taught before division.
 20   [00226]          Depending on the manner in which assessment modules are
      organized and presented, a learner's performance for a specific learning
      objective may be not be readily available without additional data processing. For
      example, if the assessment module includes a number of multiple choice
     questions for a number of content modules then the learner's performance in
25   each of the content modules may not be readily available.
     [00227]           Generally, curriculum development for a course requires instructor
     resources in that it is necessary for the instructor to spend time and effort to
     aggregate content modules and assessment modules to meet the learning
     objectives for the particular course. To reduce the resources required to prepare
30   the course, the instructor may try to look for precedents (e.g. a course that has

                                                 - 39
       been previously developed that covers at least some of the learning objects, or
       learning content that relates to at least some of the learning objects, such as sub
       units or modules within a course). For example, if the instructor has developed a
       course for similar learning objectives for a previous term, the instructor may
  5    "recycle" the previously prepared curriculum by using that previous curriculum as
       a starting point. This may be effective when there are significant similarities in the
      type and scope of learning objectives between the course that was prepared
      previously and the course that the instructor is currently developing.
      [00228]         However, in cases where there are few similarities in the learning
 10   objectives, the previously developed course will not be nearly as useful, and
      instructors would often need to substantially rework the previous course
      materials to derive any benefit therefrom.
      [00229]        In particular, the instructor may need to spend significant resources
      amending the content and/or assessments that were provided in the precedent to
 15   remove materials that are not relevant to the current course and add materials
     that are relevant. This may require the instructor to carefully examine each
     component of the precedent and determine whether it should be kept, replaced
     or reworked. For example, if the assessment modules comprise a plurality of
     questions on a plurality of content modules, the instructor will normally need to
20   go through the assessment modules on a question-by-question basis to remove
     the ones that are not "supported" or relevant to the content that is being provided
     in the current course.
     [00230]         However, some embodiments described herein attempt to assist
    the instructor in course design. In particular, embodiments described herein allow
25  the instructor to generate learning modules based on a given learning objective.
    The learning modules normally include one or more content modules and
    assessment modules that are associated with that learning objective. Because
    the embodiments allow for the instructor or other course designer to associate
    the learning modules with a specific learning objective, the learning modules can

                                               - 40
      then be reused during subsequent course development based on that learning
      objective.
      [00231]        In particular, each learning module may be defined independently.
      That is, the learning module may be formed based on a given learning objective
  5   and is generally independent from how the content modules and/or the
      assessment modules are organized and presented to the learners. As such, the
      learning module permits alignment of the components of a course with each
      learning objective, regardless of how the course components are organized and
     presented to the learners. This allows the learning modules to be easily reusable
 10  during subsequent course design, as a course instructor or designer can begin
     building their course by selecting specific learning modules based on the specific
     learning objectives they would like to include in their course.
     [00232]         Referring now to Figure 40, illustrated therein are components of an
     exemplary course 330 according to some embodiments. The course 330 may be
 15  designed, at least in part, using one or more of the course design modules and/or
     systems as described herein.
     [00233]        The course 330 is logically organized into two course units, namely
     Unit 1 and Unit 2 as indicated by reference numerals 332 and 334. In this
    embodiment the course units 332 and 334 this course divides the course to two
20  terms. In other embodiments, there may be a different number of course units
    and they may be organized differently. For example, the course may be
    organized so that each course units correspond to a chapter, a topic, and so on.
    [00234]         As shown, each of the units 332, 334 comprises a plurality of
    content modules and assessment modules. In particular, Unit 1 includes content
25  modules CO, Cl, C2, C3 and assessment modules Al and A2 in a mid-term
    assessment 336. Unit 2 includes content modules C4 and C5, an informational
    assessment       338,   and    end-of-term    assessment    340.   The  informational
    assessment 338 includes informational assessment modules Ai1, Ai2, and Ai3,
    and the end-of-term assessment 340 includes assessment modules A5 and A6.

                                              -41
      [00235]        In various embodiments, and depending on the course design, the
      numbers of units, organization and the content of each of the unit, number of
      content modules, and number of assessment modules may differ.
      [00236]        Each of the content modules includes educational material about a
  5   specific topic. For example, the content modules may include textbooks, articles,
      research papers, multimedia content such as audio data, video data, or any other
      forms of educational material. In some embodiments, the content module may
      provide the educational material over the Internet 28 (e.g. via a web page). In
     some embodiments, the content module may include references to physical
 10  textbooks that the learners may access.
     [00237]         The assessment modules may include various ways to assess the
     learner performance in the course. For example, the assessment modules may
     include    multiple-choice    questions,   short-answer  questions,  long  answer
     questions,    research    topics for   essay-type    answers,  verbal evaluations,
 15  presentations, etc.
     [00238]        The course 330 is designed to achieve four learning objectives,
     namely LO1, L02, L03, and L04 indicated generally by reference numeral 341.
     [00239]        In the embodiment as shown, each of the learning objectives 341 is
    associated with one or more of the content and assessment modules. In some
20  embodiments, this association may be made based on semantic alignment
    between the learning objectives LO1, L02, L03, and L04 and the content and
    assessment modules. For example, if a particular learning objective is about
    arithmetic, the content modules that are associated with that learning objective
    may be related to addition, subtraction or other arithmetic operations. Similarly,
25  the assessment modules that are related to the learning objectives may be
    directed to assessing the learner's understanding of that particular learning
    objective(s).
    [00240]         In some embodiments, the association between the learning
    objectives LO1, L02, L03, and L04 and the content and assessment modules is
30  made based on input received from the instructor. In other embodiments, the

                                             - 42
      associations may be made automatically for example, based on how the course
      is organized, governmental or accrediting facility guidelines, and so on.
      [00241]        As shown, in this embodiment the first learning objective LO1 is
      associated with content module Cl, and assessment modules Ai1 and A5. The
  5   second learning objective L02 is associated with content modules C2 and
      assessment modules A2, Ai2, and A5. The third learning objective L03 is
      associated with content modules C3, C4 and assessment modules Ai3, A6.
      Finally, the fourth learning objective L04 is with content module C5. Generally
      the associations between the learning objectives LO1, L02, L03, and L04,
 10   content modules and the assessment modules define learning modules.
      [00242]        In other embodiments, the number of content modules and/or
     assessment modules that are associated with each learning objective may differ.
     [00243]         In some embodiments, learning modules may be created by storing
     the association between the learning objectives and one or more content
15   modules and assessment modules in a data storage device. For example, the
     association between the components may be recorded as metadata associated
     with one or more of the components.
     [00244]        In some embodiments,        each    learning  module may include
     instances of one or more content and assessment modules such that the
20   learning modules are self-contained.
     [00245]         In some embodiments, there may be content modules that are
    provided in a course but are not associated with any learning objective. For
    example, as shown in Figure 40, content module CO may not be associated with
    any particular learning objective. The content CO, for example may be an
25  introductory chapter or some other educational material that may not be relevant
    to any of the learning objects of the course 330.
    [00246]         Referring now to Figure 41, illustrated therein are exemplary
    learning modules 342, 344, 346, 348 that are formed from the association shown
    in Figure 40. Learning module 1 includes the first learning objective LO1 and

                                                - 43
        associated content module C1, and assessment modules Ail and A5. Learning
        module 2 includes the second learning objective L02 and associated content
        module C2, and assessment modules A2, Ai2 and A5. Learning module 3
        includes the third learning objective L03 and associated content modules C3 and
   5   C4, and assessment modules Ai3 and A6. The learning module 4 includes the
       fourth learning objective L04 and associated content module C5.
       [00247]        In some embodiments, the learning modules may be published to a
       learning module repository where other instructors may subsequent access these
       modules, such as by using a search engine or by browsing through the
 10    repository. That is, the learning modules could be stored on a data storage
      device and subsequently be made available to other users designing other
      courses or otherwise searching for learning modules. This allows the learning
      modules to be reused, which can facilitate the development of other courses.
      [00248]         Referring now to Figure 44, illustrated therein is a block diagram
 15   400 illustrating an example of how the learner may interact with the course 330.
      The learner would start at block 402 where the learner consumes the content
      module CO. The learner would proceed to blocks 404, 406, 408 whereby content
      modules Cl, C2, C3 are consumed. In some embodiments, the learner may
      consume the content modules in a different order, particularly in an electronic
20    learning system such as the system 10. For example if the instructor did not
     specify that the content modules should be consumed in a particular order (e.g.
     CO before Cl, Cl before C2, C2 before C3 and so on) the learner may consume
     the content modules in any order that he or she chooses.
     [00249]         In some embodiments, one or more of the content modules may be
25   optional.
     [00250]         After consuming the content modules CO, Cl, C2, and C3 in Unit 1,
     the learner may then take the mid-term assessment 336 at block 410. In some
     embodiments, the course 330 may be configured such that the learner is not
     permitted to proceed to Unit 2 unless the midterm-assessment 336 has been
30   successfully completed.

                                             - 44
       [00251]       After completing the modules in Unit 1, the learner may proceed to
       Unit 2 whereby the learner consumes content modules C4 and C5 at blocks 412
       and 414.
       [00252]      At block 416, the learner completes the informational assessment
  5   338. The information assessment 338 may be adapted to identify the learner's
      strengths and weaknesses of the various components of the course. In some
      embodiments, performance of the learner on the informational assessment may
      not be graded or recorded as part of the overall evaluation of the learner's
      performance in the course.
 10   [00253]       Depending on the performance of the learner on the informational
     assessment 338, the learner may be suggested (e.g. using a recommendation
     engine) to perform a remedial activity at block 418.
     [00254]        In some embodiments, the type of remedial activity may be
     determined based on the performance of the learner on one or more particular
15   assessment module (or components thereof) of the informational assessment
     338. For example, if the learner performed poorly on assessment module Ai1,
     then the learner may be directed to review content module Cl which is
     associated with the Ai1 through LO1. Similarly, the learner may be directed to
     review C2 if his/her performance was poor on Ai2, and C3 and C4 if the
20  performance was poor on Ai3.
    [00255]        In some embodiments,         a recommendation      engine may be
    implemented to determine one or more remedial activities that should be
    suggested to the learner. The recommendation engine, for example, may
    conduct statistical analysis of the results of various assessment modules to
25  determine whether some learners are particularly weak on certain assessment
    modules or on certain learning objectives (or both). Based on these results, the
    recommendation       engine may identify remedial content modules that are
    associated with similar (or the same) as the learning content modules. In some
    embodiments, the recommendation engine may identify other learning content

                                                 -45
        modules that may be more effective to teaching the learning objectives
        associated with the assessment module.
        [00256]        In some embodiments, new or supplemental content modules in
       additional to the existing content modules may be provided as remedial activity at
   5   step 418.
       [00257]         In some embodiments, remedial activities other than providing
       content modules may be executed. For example, the remedial activities may
       include the instructor or a tutor providing one-on-one guidance to the learner if he
       or she performs poorly on an assessment module associated with a particular
 10    learning objective.
       [00258]        In some embodiments, an informational assessment may be
       deployed prior to, at or near the start of the course, to test the learners for their
       competency in one or more learning objectives that the learner is expected to
       have achieved prior to starting the course 330. For example, in a grade 4 math
 15   class, an initial informational assessment may be deployed to incoming students
      to ensure they have a proper grasp of fractions, certain arithmetic operations,
      and so on. In such embodiments, the informational assessment may guide the
      learner to identify areas of weaknesses and direct them to "brush-up" or seek
      supplemental learning in those areas. In some embodiments, such informational
20    assessment may be "recycled" from a prerequisite course.
      [00259]        In some embodiments, if the learner performs particularly well on
     the informational assessment (or another type of assessment), the learner may
     be provided with an option to participate in mastery activities (not shown). The
     mastery activities may include supplemental or other content modules that
25   exceed the learning objectives so that more advanced learners are exposed to
     more challenging educational material which may help retain their interest in the
     course for example.
     [00260]        After providing the remedial activity in step 418, or if no further
     remedial activity is necessary, the learner then proceeds to block 420 where the
30   end-of-term assessment may be administered.

                                             -  46
      [00261]       Generally, associating the learning objectives with related content
      and assessment modules may provide certain advantages as described herein.
      [00262]       In some embodiments, assessments associated with certain
      learning objectives may be weighted differently from other learning objectives.
  5   For example, if it is decided that learning objective LO1 is more important than
      L02, more weight may be assigned to the performance of the learner on LO1. As
      the assessment modules are associated with the learning objective it may be
      possible to assign such weighing without needing to analyze the mid-term
      assessment 338 or end-of-term assessment 340.
 10   [00263]       Additionally, as described above, the course may also provide
      informational assessment for identifying a learner's weaknesses on one or more
     of the learning objectives and to suggest related remedial activities.
     [00264]        Performance of the learners for that class may also be analyzed on
     a "learning objective by learning objective" basis. This may permit a review of the
 15  course to determine whether the learning objectives are being met effectively.
     For example, if the entire class performs poorly on a given learning objective, the
     instructor may wish to review and revise the content and/or assessment modules
     associated with the learning objective accordingly.
     [00265]       Associating    learning   objectives   with    related   content   and
20  assessment modules may promote transparency and accountability. An observer
    would be able to determine relatively easily whether certain content module or
    assessment module is related to a given learning objective. In some instances,
    administrators for the course may also use such data to measure and monitor the
    effectiveness of particular instructors at teaching particular learning objectives.
25  [00266]        Associating    learning   objectives   with    related   content   and
    assessment modules may also provide a learner with an option to consume
    these modules in a different order than in the order suggested by the
    organization of the course units. For example, the learner may consume the
    content and assessment modules according to the learning objective they are
30  associated with, which might be different from how the instructor has organized

                                             -47
      the course using course units. In such cases, information about the associated
      units (e.g. chronological information) may be provided such that the learner may
      be given a sense of how these modules relate to other modules in the course.
      [00267]        In some embodiments, the learning modules may be published to a
  5   learning module repository where other instructors may subsequently access
      these learning modules. This allows the learning modules to be reused for
      developing other courses. As the learning modules in the repositories retain their
     associations to the content modules and assessment modules, these one or
     more content and assessment modules are also available for reuse by other
 10  instructors.
     [00268]        Moreover, since some learning modules are self-contained and
     comprehensive, they can make it easier for subsequent course design in that the
     learning modules can be added to a course and the course designer can be
     reasonably confident that the desired learning objectives will be met given the
 15  content and assessments included in each of these learning modules.
     [00269]        Furthermore, some learning modules may provide a pedagogically
    sound and comprehensive educational material on aspecific learning topic (for
    e.g. by including sufficient content and assessment modules). If a new course is
    developed based on one or more pedagogically sound learning modules, the
20  newly developed course is inclined to be pedagogically sound as its constituent
    learning modules are also pedagogically sound.
    [00270]         Referring now to Figures 42 and 43, illustrated therein is an
    exemplary search interface 360 that can be implemented to search for stored
    learning modules in a repository according to one embodiment. This type of
25  search interface may be usable by someone who is developing a particular
    course with a set of particular learning objectives. In such cases, the interface
    may be used to search for specific pre-determined learning modules related to
    specific learning objective and which may include associated content and
    assessment modules.

                                             - 48
      [00271]       This may reduce the resources required to develop a course, as the
      instructor may be able to develop the course by piecing together learning
      modules for each desired learning objective.
      [00272]       In contrast, in prior approaches to course design, relying on
  5   previously developed courses that do not associate the course components to
     the learning objectives may require much greater amount of time and effort by
     the instructor or course designer to identify specific components of interest of the
     course that are related to a desired learning objective.
     [00273]       As shown, the search interface includes a keyword field 362 and a
 10  result area 364 where resulting learning modules identified by a search engine (if
     any) may be displayed.
     [00274]        In Figure 42, a keyword 365, namely "CIVIL WAR" is inputted in
     field 362 and several relevant learning modules 366 are returned as results. As
     shown, the generated learning modules 366 for the keyword 365 include learning
 15  modules x1, x2, and x3, indicated by reference numerals 368, 370, and 372
     respectively.
     [00275]       The learning module x1l has a learning objective entitled "Battle of
    Gettysburg", content module x1l, and assessment x1. The learning module x2
    has a learning objective entitled "Reasons for Civil War", content module x2, and
20  assessment module x2. The learning module x3 has a learning objective entitled
    "Abraham Lincoln", content module x3, and assessment module x3. In other
    embodiments, the number and type of content and assessment components of
    each of the learning modules 366 may differ.
    [00276]        To facilitate searching, in some embodiments various related
25  search keywords or "tags" may be associated with the learning modules when
    the learning modules are created and stored. In some embodiments, these tags
    may be provided by the entity creating the learning module. In other
    embodiments, the tags or keywords may be automatically extracted from the
    components of the learning module (e.g. using semantic learning). For example,

                                             - 49
       tags may include some components of the learning objective, words that occur
       most frequently in the content modules and so on.
       [00277]       Referring to the interface 360 shown in Figure 43, a second
       keyword 374 or query ("PRESIDENTS") is inputted in the field 362 to generate
  5    other relevant learning modules 376. As shown, the generated learning modules
       376 include learning modules y1l, y2, and x3, indicated by reference numerals
      378, 380, and 372 respectively.
      [00278]        The learning module yl has a learning objective entitled "Barack
      Obama", content module y1l, and assessment y1l. The learning module y2 has a
 10   learning objective entitled "George W. Bush", content module y2, and
      assessment module y2. The learning module x3, as described above, has a
      learning   objective entitled "Abraham      Lincoln", content module    x3, and
      assessment module x3. As shown, the learning module x3 is common to the
     searches in both Figures 42 and 43.
 15  [00279]        Generally, the learning modules provide a more granular method to
     search for and reuse course curriculum that has already been developed. For
     example, to develop an introductory course on the history of U.S. politics, a
     course designer may select some learning modules that are provided in different
     searches, for example by using the search interface 360. As each of the learning
20   modules includes at least one content module and/or assessment modules, it
     reduces the need for the designer from having to develop content and/or
    assessment modules from scratch for each particular desired learning objective,
    as he or she will be able to use (and where desired modify) the existing
    components of the learning modules selected for their course.
25  [00280]         Furthermore, the modification, updates, and/or other improvements
    that the designer makes on the existing learning module may be repackaged as
    a new or improved learning module, which may then stored for use by other
    designers. This tends to provide for incremental improvement and aggregation of
    knowledge over time as the repository of learning modules can continue to grow.

                                               - 50
        [00281]       In some embodiments, the results returned by the search interface
        360 may be based on search engine logic, which can include semantic
        searching, natural language, Boolean logic, or other searching techniques as are
        known.
   5   [00282]        In some embodiments a course design module may be adapted to
       guide a user through the course development process to develop a
       pedagogically sound course. For example, the course design module may check
       whether a content module is associated with at least one learning objective, and
       if no such associations exist, the course design module may remind the user that
  10   there may be no content modules that address the learning objective. A similar
       check may be performed for assessment modules
       [00283]       For instance, turning now to Figure 45, in some embodiments a
      course design module may be adapted to allow the user to associate learning
      objectives with one or more course items (e.g. course content modules,
 15   assessments, and so on). For example, as shown in Figure 45 an Objectives tab
      700 on a particular page may provide the user with the ability to associate
      learning objectives by selecting a button 702 or other control.
      [00284]        Once the button 702 has been activated, an Add Associated
      Learning Objectives page 704 may be displayed, as shown in Figure 46. In some
 20  embodiments this page 704 may allow the user to navigate (e.g. by browsing or
     searching) to select one or more learning objectives. For example, as shown, the
     page 704 may display a plurality of learning objectives 706 related to public
     speaking under a tree-structure 708 that displays available competency
     structures which can be selected by the user.
25   [00285]        In some embodiments one or more learning objectives may be
     associated without evaluation methods. For example, as shown in Figure 47 a
     page 710 may displayed that indicates that a particular learning objective is not
     being evaluated. This may be useful where a user wants to align a particular
     course to a particular learning objective without providing an evaluation or
30   assessment. This may help indicate the coverage of a learning objective within a

                                             -51
      course without requiring any formal assessment of that item, and generally
      without an impact on goal management or automatic competency evaluations.
      [00286]       In some such embodiments, as shown in Figure 47, the user may
      be prompted (e.g. by text or via a link 712) to add an assessment method if they
  5   so desire.
      [00287]       In some embodiments, one or more learning objectives may be
      associated with evaluation or assessment modules. For example, as shown in
      Figure 48, a page 714 may be displayed that allows one or more learning
     objectives to be associated, and includes an identified assessment method 716.
 10  This may be useful when a user wants to evaluate a particular item with a
     numeric grade or a rubric, and wants to have views into user and class
     achievement, but may not want the item's assessment to be used for goal
     management, or automatic competency evaluation, which might be done in the
     future. This may also appropriate for diagnostic and formative assessments, for
 15  example.
     [00288]       In some embodiments, goal management may also be provided.
     For example, as shown in Figure 49, a page 718 may be presented that allows
     learning objectives to be associated and which also identifies a goal 720 for the
     purposes of goal management. This may be useful when a user wants to
20   evaluate an item with a numeric grade or a rubric, wants to have views into user
     and class achievement, and wants to use the assessment of the item for
     automatic competency evaluation. This may also be appropriate for summative
     assessments     in courses that track competency         and   learning   objective
    achievement.
25  [00289]        Turning now to Figure 50, in some embodiments a course design
    module may be adapted to allow learning objectives to be associated with
    particular content modules. For example, as shown a page 730 may be displayed
    that allows the structure of one or more learning objectives to be edited, and may
    include one or more content modules 732 associated therewith. Using the course
30  design module, users can associate content modules and topics with learning

                                                - 52
        objectives, for example through the Objectives tab 700. Aligning Content may
        assist in providing a clearer picture of "objective coverage within a course" when
        examining the structure of a learning objective. It can also provide guidance for
        releasing remedial or advanced material related to one or more learning
   5   objectives based on the level of achievement for an aligned assessment.
       [00290]         Aligning content to learning objectives may also useful for
       publishing materials to a repository or other database. For example, if a course
       design module is suitably configured, published learning modules can be
       automatically classified in a repository as described above.
 10    [00291]        Turning now to Figure 51, in some embodiments one or more
       subcomponents of an assessment may be associated with a particular learning
       objective. For example, a user may desire to associate one or more questions in
      a quiz with a particular learning objective, since in practice a subset of quiz
      questions are often associated with particular learning objectives (as opposed to
 15   an entire quiz). Accordingly, as shown specific quiz questions within a quiz (or
      other subcomponents of an assessment) can be aligned to a learning objective
      using page 740 by selecting an Associate Questions button 742.
      [00292]         In addition, as shown in Figure 52 a user may be prompted to
      provide a learning objective assessment method for quizzes 744 (called "Score
20    on selected questions") as shown in page 746. This may be a numeric score of
      all questions in the quiz that are aligned to the particular learning objective, which
     may allow for more specific evaluation of a particular learner's performance with
     respect to that learning objective. In particular, this may provide for more
     powerful diagnostic and formative quizzes covering multiple learning objectives,
25   and allow instructors to more easily find areas of strength and weakness in a
     class by looking at resulting scores for the learners.
     [00293]         As shown, in some embodiments a release condition 748 for the
     score may also be specified.
     [00294]          Referring now to Figure 53, illustrated therein an educational
30   method 800 for developing an educational course. The educational method 800

                                               - 53
      may be executed by one or more components of the system 10, for example, by
      the processing device (server) 32.
      [00295]        In the embodiment as shown, the method 800 begins at step 802.
      In other embodiments the order of performance of the steps of the method may
  5   differ. For example, some of the steps may be performed simultaneously or in a
      different order.
      [00296]        At step 802, at least one learning objective is defined for the
     course. In some embodiments the learning objective may be defined based on
      input from one or more users. In other embodiments, the learning objective may
 10  be provided by the system, for example, based on guidelines provided by
     educational standard institutions (e.g. government).
