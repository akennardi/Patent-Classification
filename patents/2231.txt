   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions, containing 4-[1-(2,3
   dimethylphenyl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole, (S) 4-[l-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)ethyl]-1H
15 imidazole or (S) [3-(1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethyl)-2-methylphenyl] methanol, their use as
   pharmaceuticals for the treatment of retinal diseases, for retinal neuroprotection and
   vision enhancement. Three alpha-1 and three alpha-2 adrenergic receptors have
   been characterized by molecular and pharmacological methods. Activation of these
   alpha receptors evokes physiological responses with useful therapeutic actions.
20 SUMMARY OF THE RELATED ART
   Compound, 4-[1-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole, generically known as,
   medetomidine is an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist, for use in the sedation of animals.
   The the (S) enantiomer of medetomidine, generically known as dexmedetomidine,
   (S) 4-[1-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole, is also indicated for use as a
25 sedative or analgesic in cats and dogs administered as the hydrochloride salt. The
   metabolite of dexmedetomidine is (S) [3-(1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)ethyl)-2-methylphenyl]
   methanol, generically known as, OH-dexmedetomidine, is a potent pan alpha2
   adrenergic agonist, activating all three alpha2 receptor subtypes. These properties
   are beneficial for sustained activity, particularly when the drug is delivered
30 continuously.
   Dexmedetomidine is a potent alpha2-adrenergic agonist, activating all three alpha2
   receptor subtypes. It is, however, a partial agonist of the alpha2A receptor, which
   may result in less receptor desensitization and down regulation (shown in Table 2). It
                                                 1

   is also highly selective for the alpha2 receptor relative to alphal-adrenergic receptor
   activation.
   The compound (5-bromo-quinoxalin-6-yl)-imidazolidin-2-ylidene-amine (structure
   shown below) is generically known as brimonidine tartrate and is sold under the
 5 trademark ALPHAGAN*P (available from Allergan, Inc.). Pharmacological activation
   of the alpha 2 adrenergic receptor by brimonidine is a well established treatment for
   various visual disorders of the eye.

   longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or
   glyceryl distearate may be employed. In some cases, formulations for oral use may
   be in the form of hard gelatin capsules wherein the invention compounds are mixed
   with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or
 5 kaolin. They may also be in the form of soft gelatin capsules wherein the invention
   compounds are mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid
   paraffin or olive oil.
   The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable
   suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to known methods using
10 suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable
   preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic
   parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3
   butanediol. Sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending
   medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic
15 mono- or diglycerides, fatty acids (including oleic acid), naturally occurring vegetable
   oils like sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, etc., or synthetic fatty
   vehicles like ethyl oleate or the like. Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants, and the like
   can be incorporated as required.
   The present invention concerns also the use of a compound: medetomidine,
20 dexmedetomidine, or OH-dexmedetomidine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
   thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the therapeutic application. The
   present invention concerns also a method for manufacturing a medicament intended
   for therapeutic application wherein a compound : medetomidine, dexmedetomidine,
   or OH-dexmedetomidine or a pharmaceutically active derivative or salt thereof is
25 used.
   Since individual subjects may present a wide variation in severity of symptoms and
   each drug has its unique therapeutic characteristics, the precise mode of
   administration and dosage employed for each subject is left to the discretion of the
   practitioner. The patient will be administered the compound orally in any acceptable
30 form, such as a tablet, liquid, capsule, powder and the like, or other routes may be
   desirable or necessary, particularly if the patient suffers from nausea. Such other

   routes may include, without exception, transdermal, parenteral, subcutaneous,
   intranasal, via an implant stent, intrathecal, intravitreal, topical to the eye, back to the
   eye, intramuscular, intravenous, and intrarectal modes of delivery. The actual
   amount of the compound to be administered in any given case will be determined by
 5 a physician taking into account the relevant circumstances, such as the severity of
   the condition, the age and weight of the patient, the patient's general physical
   condition, the cause of the condition, and the route of administration. Additionally,
   the formulations may be designed to delay release of the active compound over a
   given period of time, or to carefully control the amount of drug released at a given
10 time during the course of therapy.
   Medetomidine, dexmedetomidine, or OH-dexmedetomidine and their
   pharmaceutically-acceptable salts may be administered through different routes,
   including but not limited to topical eye drops, direct injection, application at the back
   of the eye or formulations that may further enhance the long duration of actions such
15 as a slow releasing pellet, suspension, gel, or sustained delivery devices such as
   any suitable drug delivery system (DDS) known in the art. While topical
   administration is preferred, this compound may also be used in an intraocular
   implant as described in U.S. U.S. Patent 7,931,909. Such biocompatible intraocular
   implants include medetomidine, dexmedetomidine, or OH-dexmedetomidine and a
20 polymer associated with medetomidine, dexmedetomidine, or OH-dexmedetomidine
   to facilitate release thereof into an eye for an extended period of time.
   Ophthalmic formulations of drug products are well known in the art and described in,
   for example, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20050059583; No.
   20050277584; U.S. Patent No. 7,297,679; and No. 20070015691; and U.S. Patent
25 Nos. 5,474,979 and 6,582,718. Medetomidine, dexmedetomidine, or OH
   dexmedetomidine may be formulated with efficacy enhancing components as
   disclosed in U.S. Patent Number 7,491,383 B2.

   The present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically enriched
   compounds. Any compound of the invention may contain one or more isotopic
   atoms enriched or different than the natural ratio such as deuterium    2H (or D) in
   place of protium 1H (or H) or use of 13 C enriched material in place of  12C and the like.
 5 Similar substitutions can be employed for N, 0 and S. The use of isotopes may
   assist in analytical as well as therapeutic aspects of the invention. For example, use
   of deuterium may increase the in vivo half-life by altering the metabolism (rate) of the
   compounds of the invention. These compounds can be prepared in accord with the
   preparations described by use of isotopically enriched reagents.
10 The following assays and animal models are used to demonstrate the potency and
   selectivity of the compounds according to the invention.
   Results from an in vitro GTPase assay of alpha 2A receptor activation are shown in
   Table 1 for brimonidine, dexmedetomidine , OH-dexmedetomidine and OH
   medetomidine ( mixture of OH-dexmedetomidine and its opposite enantiomer). The
15 data show that dexmedetomidine, OH-dexmedetomidine and OH-medetomidine are
   partial agonists with levels of efficacy 0.78, 0.65 and 0.26, respectively, of the
   efficacy of the full agonist brimonidine.

20 In the GTPase assay, receptor activation results in dissociation of GDP and binding
   of the nonhydrolyzable [35S]GTPyS to receptor-coupled G-proteins. The extent of
   binding is a measure of receptor activation. Membranes were prepared from HEK
   cells transiently expressing the alpha 2A receptor and the three subunits of the Gi G
   protein. Membranes were thawed and resuspended using a Polytron disrupter in 40C
25 membrane buffer and quantified via Bradford assay. The quantified protein was then

   mM EDTA, 3pM propranolol, and 0.1 mM AMP; pH 7.4 and 40C to achieve a 100
   pg/ml concentration, allowed to incubate for 15 minutes, and then incubated for an
   additional 10 minutes in the presence of 6 pM GDP. The above mixture was then
 5 aliquoted, 50 pL/well, in a 96 well plate, combined with an equal volume of test
   compound dissolved in assay buffer [50 mM Tris-HCI, 100 mM NaCI, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1
   mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT, pH 7.4 and 40C], and allowed to incubate for 5 minutes.
   Immediately following the above incubation, the mixture was combined with 50 pL of
   1.5 nM [35S]GTPyS in assay buffer and shaken covered for 60 minutes at 25*C.
10 Assays were terminated by vacuum filtration over GF/B filters blocked with 0.5%
   BSA. Filters were then washed with 40C wash buffer [50 mM Tris-HCI, 100 mM
   NaCI, and 5 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7.5. The incorporated [35S]GTPyS was determined using
   a Microbeta 1450B liquid scintillation counter after the plates had dried overnight.
   Binding studies showed that OH-Dexmedetomidine, a partial agonist induces very
15 little down regulation of alpha 2A receptor. In contrast, brimonidine, a full agonist
   induced a strong reduction in the alpha 2A receptor density. Human embryonic
   kidney (HEK) 293T cells stably transfected with the a2A-adrenergic receptor were
   grown to 50-60% confluency on T-175 culture flasks in DMEM (Gibco, cat. #11995),
   10% FBS (Gibco, cat. #16140), 0.25pg/ml puromycin (Sigma, cat. # P-8833), and
20 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, cat. #15240) maintained at 370C and 5% C02. After
   reaching the desired confluency, the cells were incubated for 24 hours in growth
   media treated with 0, 1,000, or 10,000 nM brimonidine and maintained at 370C and
   5% C02. The cells were then washed with room temperature Delbuco's phosphate
   buffered saline (DPBS; Gibeo, cat. # 14190).

   Cells were harvested with 40C Tris-EDTA buffer [50mM Tris-HCI, 5mM EDTA; pH
 5 7.4] and centrifuged at 5,000 x g for 5 minutes at 40C. Membrane preparation was
   conducted by resuspending the cell pellets in 40C Tris-EDTA buffer and lysed with a
   Polytron disrupter two times (setting 7, 5 seconds each). The lysed suspension was
   then centrifuged at -35,000 x g for 32 minutes at 40C. After decanting the
   supernatant, the pelleted material was further lysed in 4*C Tris buffer [50 mM Tris
10 HCI; pH 8.0] using the Polytron disrupter (setting 4, 5 seconds). Membranes were
   then aliquoted, pelleted at -37,000 x g for 32 minutes at 40C, and stored at -80oC
   until use.
   Membranes were thawed and resuspended using a Polytron disrupter in 40C HBSS
   HEPES buffer [1 part 1M HEPES: 5 parts 10 x Hank's Balanced Salt Solution: 43.8
15 parts H2 0; pH 7.4 with KOH) and quantified via Bradford assay. The quantified
   protein was further diluted with HBSS-HEPES buffer to achieve a 100 pg/ml
   concentration. Membrane suspension was plated in a 96-well plate at 2001pLs/weil
   ±10 pM phentolamine HCI (Sigma, cat. # P-7547) and [Methyl- 3 H] Rauwolscine (15
   nM to 0.05nM; PerkinElmer, cat. # NET722250UC). The assay plate was slowly
20 shaken and incubated at 250C for ninety minutes. Immediately following the above
   incubation, the assays were terminated by vacuum filtration over GF/B filters. Filters
   were then washed with 40C HBSS-HEPES buffer. The incorporated [Methyl- 3H]
   Rauwolscine was determined using a Microbeta 1450B liquid scintillation counter
   after the plates had dried overnight.

                                    The blue light model
   In order to demonstrate the advantage of partial alpha 2A agonists in treatment of
   retinal disease, OH-dexmedetomidine was compared to the vehicle in the blue light
30 model of retinal degeneration in rats. Drugs were administered continuously with
   subcutaneous infusion pumps at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day starting two days before blue
   light exposure. These concentrations result in drug levels in the retina of 2.3 ng/g

   OH-dexmedetomidine which are sufficient for pharmacological activity. Twenty 4
   month old male Sprague Dawley rats (body weight 470-550 g) were used in this
   study. The animals were exposed to room light on a 12 hour light/1 2 hour dark cycle
   before the experiment. All animals were dark adapted overnight (16-20 hours) before
 5 blue light. Under the intensity of 6100-6500 lux, rats were exposed to blue light for 4
   hours. After the blue light, rats were placed in the dark for another 3 days before
   returning to normal 12 hour light/1 2 hour dark. Ocular Coherence Tomography
   (OCT) measurement was performed at 7 days post blue light exposure. The results
   of Figure 1 demonstrate that blue light exposure with just saline treatment leads to
10 dramatic reduction of retinal thickness measured by OCT, particularly in the superior
   retina. Histology studies have shown that the reduction in retinal thickness is
   attributable to loss of photoreceptors. The treatment with OH-dexmedetomidine
   significantly reduced the damage caused by blue light.
