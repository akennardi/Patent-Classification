                                                        Adjuvant Compositions
[0001A]               This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn>, the
entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
[0001B]               The present invention relates generally to adjuvants for agrochemicals. In particular,
the present invention relates to the use of certain terpenic alkoxylates as adjuvants to improve
the performance of agrochemicals and to agrochemical compositions containing such adjuvants.
[0002] The present invention provides mixtures comprising certain terpenic alkoxylate
adjuvants A and an agrochemical component B. Component B is an agrochemical active
ingredient. Suitable agrochemical active ingredients include insecticides, acaricides,
nematocides, molluscicides, fungicides, herbicides, plant growth regulators as well as fertilizers
and micronutrients.
[0003] It has now been found, surprisingly, that the agrochemical active ingredient - adjuvant
mixture according to the invention can extend the range of action of the agrochemical active
ingredient e.g. by achieving a synergistic effect. Thus, the rates of application of the
components are lowered whilst the action remains equally good. Secondly, the active ingredient
mixture still achieves a high degree of pest or weed control, sometimes even where the two
individual components have become totally ineffective in such a low application rate range.
This allows increased safety in use or any other advantages familiar to a person skilled in the
art.
[0004] Accordingly, the present invention provides an adjuvant composition comprising at least
one terpenic alkoxylate A and at least one agrochemical active ingredient B. When used herein,
the term "terpenic" in the context of the terpenic alkoxylate component is indicative of a moiety
having terpenic origin. In a further embodiment, the adjuvant composition of the invention may
also contain water and/or one or more organic diluents such alkyl alcohols and/or glycols.
[0005] The present invention also provides a method of using of the above described adjuvant
composition to enhance plant growth in plant growth media by contacting the plants, parts of
plants, seeds, their locus of growth or the plant growth media with an effective amount of said
adjuvant composition.

        WO 2013/110553                                                           PCT/EP2013/050922
                                                     -2
    [0006] In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of enhancing
    the bio-efficacy or bio-availability of at least one agrochemical B said method comprising
    applying the agrochemical to plants, parts of plants, seeds, or at their locus of growth in any
  5 desired sequence, including simultaneously, separately, or in succession with a terpenic
    alkoxylate component according to the present invention in an amount effective to enhance
    bio-efficacy or bio-availability of said at least one agrochemical.
    [0007] In the practice of the invention, the terpenic alkoxylate component of the invention
 .0 can be applied as a concentrate or by dispersing the concentrate according to the present
    invention in water for use as a diluted aqueous end-use formulation.
    [0008] The inventive adjuvant composition may be applied directly or with dilution in water
    alone or in combination with agrochemical materials such as insecticides, acaricides,
 .5 nematocides, molluscicides, fungicides, herbicides, plant growth regulators as well as
    fertilizers and micronutrients.
    [0009] The various aspects of the present invention mentioned above, as well as many other
    aspects of the invention are described in greater detail below.
 PO
    [0010] Accordingly, in one embodiment, the at least one terpenic alkoxylate is selected from
    a compound of the formulae (II):
    R 3-0-(CH(R 4)CH 2 0).-(CH(R 4)CH 2 0)m-R                     (II)
    wherein R 3 is a terpenic moiety selected from the group consisting of terpenic carbides,
25  oxidized derivatives of terpenic carbides (such as hydroformylation derivatives), terpenic
    alcohols, terpenic aldehydes and ketones, and mixtures thereof; R 4 is selected from hydrogen
    and methyl (i.e., the -(CH(R 4)CH 20)- units of the alkylene oxide moiety of formula (II) are
    selected from ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO) in either a block or random
    configuration); R 5 is selected from hydrogen and linear or branched C1-C8 alkyl; and where n
30  and m are each other than zero and wherein the sum of n and m is chosen so that there are
    from 2 to 10 propylene oxide units and from 5 to 25 ethylene oxide units.

        WO 2013/110553                                                         PCT/EP2013/050922
                                                       -3
    [0011] In one aspect, the terpenic moiety R 3 is a moiety derived from monoterpenes,
    sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and hydroformylation derivatives thereof In particular, there may
    be mentioned the terpenes containing ten carbon atoms in their structure and, more
    specifically, acyclic, monocyclic or bicyclic monoterpenes. Among the suitable
  5 monoterpenes there are, for example, monocyclic terpenic carbides such as dipentene,
    terpinolene, p-cymene, limonene, etc.; bicyclic terpenic carbides such as a-pinene, P-pinene
    or 6-3-carene, etc.; and terpenic alcohols such as bomeol, fenchol, menthanol, terpineols,
    geraniol, etc.; hydroformylation derivatives thereof; and mixtures thereof
 .0 [0012] In another aspect, in the terpenic alkoxylate of formula (II) the sum of n and m is
    chosen so that there are from 3 to 7 propylene oxide units and from 5 to 15 ethylene oxide
    units; more particularly, from 3 to 7 propylene oxide units and from 5 to 9 ethylene oxide
    units - in any case, in either a block or a random configuration.
 .5 [0013] In one embodiment, the terpenic alkoxylate of formula (II) is selected from a block
    copolymer of the formulae (Ila) or (Ilb):
            R3-POn-EOm-R 5                            (Ila)
            R3-EOn-POm-R 5                            (Ilb)
 Po [0014] In another embodiment, the terpenic alkoxylate of formula (II) is a random EO/PO
    copolymer (I1c):
            R 3-(random EO/PO)n+m-R 5                 (I1c)
    [0015] In a specific embodiment, the R 3 moiety of formula (II) is derived from the
25  hydroformulation of P-pinene so that the terpenic alkoxylate (b) is a Nopol alkoxylate of the
    formula (Ild)
     H3 C    CH 3                                                   (Ild)
                /        0-(CH(R 4 )CH 20)n-(CH(R 4 )CH 2 0)m-R
                                                                          wherein R 4 , R 5 , m and n
    are as defined above. In a more specific embodiment, the terpenic alkoxylate (b) is Nopol
    (POn-EOm)-H, where Nopol is the hydroformylation product of -pinene, and wherein n=5
30  and m=7.

        WO 2013/110553                                                          PCT/EP2013/050922

    [0017] The components B are known, e.g. from "The Pesticide Manual", Fifteenth Edition,
    Edited by Clive Tomlin, British Crop Protection Council.
    [0018] The combinations according to the invention may also comprise more than one of the
 .0 active components B, if, for example, a broadening of the spectrum of pest control is desired.
    For instance, it may be advantageous in the agricultural practice to combine two or three
    components B with a terpenic alkoxylate. The mixtures of the invention may also comprise
    other active ingredients in addition to a terpenic alkoxylate and component B.

25  limitation and is to be understood as including also useful plants which have been so
    transformed by the use of recombinant DNA techniques
    [0027] In one embodiment, the adjuvant of the invention is well tolerated by all major turf
    species various turf grasses including the cool-season turf grasses (at seeding or to
30  established annual ryegrass, fine fescue, Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass, tall fescue)
    and warm-season turf grasses (centipede, hybrid bermudagrass, and St. Augustinegrass.
    There may also be mentioned common bermuda and zoysiagrass).

    [0028] In general, the formulations include from 0.01 to 90% by weight of active agent, from
    0 to 20% agriculturally acceptable surfactant and 10 to 99.99% solid or liquid formulation
    inerts and adjuvant(s), the active agent consisting of at least the terpenic alkoxylate A
    together with a compound of component B, and optionally other active agents, particularly
  5 microbiocides or conservatives or the like. Concentrated forms of compositions generally
    contain in between about 2 and 80%, preferably between about 5 and 70% by weight of
    active agent. Application forms of formulation may for example contain from 0.01 to 20% by
    weight, preferably from 0.01 to 50% by weight of active agent. Whereas commercial products
    will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ diluted
 .0 formulations.
    [0029] In one embodiment, the adjuvant component A of the invention is applied in an
    effective amount which is typically at a rate of 20 1/ha in a water volume of 200-1000 litres
    per hectare using conventional spray equipment.

    EXAMPLES
    [0030] The following examples are provided for illustration purposes and should not be
    considered as limiting the scope of the invention.
 Po [0031] In general, active ingredient is formulated (SC, SL) and just before spraying the
    formulations are mixed with water and ultrasonically agitated in order to achieve
    homogeneous distribution. Spray solutions are made up in water. Adjuvants are added as
    tank mix to the spray solution just before application. Foliar application is at 200 L/ha in an
    application device spraying with a single nozzle (type Lechler) 60 cm above the plants.
25  Preventative tests are performed as 1 or 2 day preventative applications, i.e. plants are treated
    with the compounds 1 or 2 days prior to artificial inoculation with fungal spores, whereas for
    curative tests the inoculation is carried out prior to application. A single evaluation of disease
    level is made 5 to 48 days after inoculation, depending on the pathosystem. Disease control
    relative to the untreated check plants is then calculated. In the following examples, all
30  treatments were sprayed at 2001/ha spray volume in 10% isopropanol solution to normalise
    foliar retention: Azoxystrobin; - Quadris SC250, Isopyrazam; - SC250, Cyproconazole:
