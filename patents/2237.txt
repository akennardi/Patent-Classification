BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the invention
 [0003]         The invention relates generally to compositions and methods for altering the
negative effects and disease progression of poly-glutamate associated diseases, such as
Huntington's disease.
Description of the Related Art
 [0004]        Huntington's disease is an inherited disease that causes the progressive
breakdown (degeneration) of nerve cells in the brain, resulting in a cognitive and motor
 function decline [1, 2]. The aggregation of a mutant Huntingtin protein (Htt) in cells alters
protein function and gene regulation, which causes movement, thinking (cognitive) and
psychiatric disorders along with neuronal death. Most people with Huntington's disease
 develop signs and symptoms in their 20's or 30's, but the onset of disease may be earlier or
 later in life, with a patient's death typically occurring within 10-15 years of diagnosis. A
juvenile form of Huntington's occurs in about 6% of patients characterized by rapid onset of
 symptoms and disease progression beginning in early childhood.
 [0005]        The genetic mutation that causes Huntington's disease is found in repeats of the
 amino acid glutamine (Q) near the amino terminus of the Huntingtin protein, called HttpolyQ
 or HttpQ. The number of repeats is generally predictive of the age of onset and progression
rate in the subject. Repeats of more than 38 Q's result in Huntington's Disease pathology.
The function of the Huntingtin protein is not well characterized, but it appears to be involved
 in transport functions of vesicles containing neurotransmitters and other molecules needed
 for cell and tissue function [3, 4]. Although the mutation is found in all cells, Huntington's
 disease manifests predominantly in the brain.
 [0006]        Aggregation of HttpQ leads to abnormal and arrested degradation of the
Huntingtin protein and the production of toxic degradation products that appear to enter the
nucleus of the cell and play a role in gene dysregulation [5]. HttpQ fragments in the nucleus
bind to transcriptional regulatory proteins that drive cellular functions [4- 6]. Furthermore,
                                                  1

 WO 2014/193632                                                               PCT/US2014/037563
toxic fragments of HttpQ that accumulate in the nucleus alter gene expression by direct
binding to DNA and by altering chromatin structure [7, 8]. Several lines of evidence
demonstrate that a caspase 6-cleaved fragment accumulates in the nucleus and blockage of
Capsase 6 cleavage eliminates generation of the toxic nuclear fragment resulting in the
absence of disease in HttpQ animals [9-11]. The patterns of gene dysregulation are well
characterized and consistent in cell-based systems, in animal models that exhibit HttpQ
aggregation and in patient samples taken at autopsy. The gene families mostly affected are
those that regulate protein synthesis and degradation, protein folding (also known as heat
shock pathways), and mitochondrial function that provide power to cells.
[0007]       The subsequent loss of neurons that regulate motor function and cognition leads to
progressive dementia and loss of motor control. Thus, there is a need for compositions and
methods that modify the degradation process. In particular, disease modification therapy
must demonstrate the ability to prevent gene dysregulation and HttpQ aggregation, which
appears to be a primary factor in disease progression. To date, no disease-modifying
therapeutic agents have been identified that prevent aggregation of HttpQ and modify gene
dysregulation. Conventional medications and treatments lessen symptoms of movement and
psychiatric disorders. For example, the only FDA approved drug for Huntington's disease
(Xenazine@) provides temporary relief of chorea, a diagnostic part of motor movement
dysfunction that led to the initial characterization of this disease.
[0008]       The present disclosure seeks to fulfill this need and provide further related
advantages.

cells transfected with aggregating HttpQ103-GFP (PQ103); and 293T cells transfected with
aggregating HttpQ 103 -GFP (PQ 103) and Intrabody (INT4 1).
[0042]      FIG. 5 illustrates the flow cytometry data tabulated for the groups tested (control,
PQ30, PQ103, PQ103 + HappIt and PQ103+INT41) measured by GFP fluorescence.
[0043]      FIG. 6 shows the effect of INT41 on the expression of genes that exhibit over
expression caused by HttpQ.
[0044]      FIG. 7 shows the effects of INT41 on the under-expression of genes caused by
PQ 103.
[0045]      FIG. 8 is a schematic illustration of the construction of a recombinant adeno
associated virus (rAAV), as described by Chen, H. Mol Ther, 2008. 16(5): 924-311.
[0046]      FIG. 9 demonstrates the effect of INT41 on inhibiting a toxic nuclear fragment
from binding to chromatin in the nucleus. INT41 blocked membrane accumulation of full
length Htt and blocked chromatin binding of toxic Htt Fragments (shown in a Western blot).
Blots were probed with antibody to N-terminal fragment.
[0047]      FIG. 10 shows that the transcriptional regulatory CREB binding is increased in
HttQ73 chromatin/DNA fraction and that INT41 decreases CREB binding to
chromatin/DNA. Immunoblots shown in FIG. 9 were re-probed with anti-CREB antibody
(mock transduced with AAV6 ("M")), but binding of CREB to chromatin/DNA was reduced
when cells were transduced with rAAV6-INT41 (lane marked as "41"). Lanes contain
fractions from cytoplasmic (Cyto), membrane (Mem), nuclear soluble (Nsol) or
chromatin/DNA (Chro) from cell lysates from induced PC12Q73 cells that were transduced
with either AAV6 not containing INT41 (M) or with rAAV6-INT41 (41).

fragments. FIG. 11 demonstrates that when lysates from HttQ73 induced cells (right
columns) are passed through an immobilized-INT41 affinity column, only smaller fragments

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Definitions
[0057]       Terms used in the claims and specification are defined as set forth below unless
otherwise specified.
[0058]       The term "ameliorating" refers to any therapeutically beneficial result in the
treatment of a disease state, e.g., a disease state associated with Huntington's disease,
including prophylaxis, lessening in the severity or progression, remission, or cure thereof.
[0059]       The term "in situ" refers to processes that occur in a living cell growing separate
from a living organism, e.g., growing in tissue culture.
[0060]       The term "in vivo" refers to processes that occur in a living organism.
[0061]       The term "mammal" as used herein includes both humans and non-humans and
include but is not limited to humans, non-human primates, canines, felines, murines, bovines,
equines, and porcines.
[0062]       The term percent "identity" in the context of two or more nucleic acid or
polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that have a specified
percentage of nucleotides or amino acid residues that are the same, when compared and
aligned for maximum correspondence, as measured using one of the sequence comparison
algorithms described below (e.g., BLASTP and BLASTN or other algorithms available to
persons of skill) or by visual inspection. Depending on the application, the percent "identity"
can exist over a region of the sequence being compared, e.g., over a functional domain, or,
alternatively, exist over the full length of the two sequences to be compared.
[0063]       For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to
which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and
reference sequences are input into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if
necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence
comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s)
relative to the reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters.
[0064]       Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the
local homology algorithm of Smith & Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482 (1981), by the
homology alignment algorithm of Needleman & Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 (1970), by the
search for similarity method of Pearson & Lipman, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444
(1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and
                                                11

 WO 2014/193632                                                               PCT/US2014/037563
TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575
Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by visual inspection (see Ausubel et al, infra).
[0065]        One example of an algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence
identity and sequence similarity is the BLAST algorithm, which is described in Altschul et
al, J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990). Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly
available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
[0066]       The term "sufficient amount" means an amount sufficient to produce a desired
effect, e.g., an amount sufficient to modulate protein aggregation in a cell.
[0067]       The term "therapeutically effective amount" is an amount that is effective to
ameliorate a symptom of a disease. A therapeutically effective amount can be a
"prophylactically effective amount" as prophylaxis can be considered therapy.
[0068]       The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to a carrier for
administration of a therapeutic agent. Such carriers include, but are not limited to, saline,
buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The term
specifically excludes cell culture medium. For drugs administered orally, pharmaceutically
acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such
as inert diluents, disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents,
flavoring agents, coloring agents and preservatives. Suitable inert diluents include sodium
and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, and lactose, while corn starch and
alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin,
while the lubricating agent, if present, will generally be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or
talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or
glyceryl distearate, to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.
[0069]       It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the
singular forms "a," ''an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates
otherwise.
Intrabodies
[0070]       An "intrabody" refers to an antibody that binds an intracellular protein.
Intrabodies are modified to remain and function inside the cell (intracellular localization).
Examples of modifications include a single-chain antibody (single-chain variable fragment,
or scFv), modification of immunoglobulin variable light (VL) or heavy (VH) domains for
hyperstability, or selection of antibodies resistant to the more reducing intracellular
                                                12

 WO 2014/193632                                                               PCT/US2014/037563
 environment.. An intrabody comprises a variable heavy sequence, a linker sequence and a
variable light sequence.
 [0071]      A "single-chain variable fragment" (scFv) is a fusion protein of the variable
regions of the heavy (VH) and light chains (VL) of immunoglobulins, connected with a short
 linker peptide. The linker peptide can be about ten to 25 amino acids in length. Although the
two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be
joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a
 single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules.
See e.g., Bird et al., Science 242: 423-426, 1988; and Huston et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci.
 USA, 85: 5879-5883, 1988. The linker is usually rich in glycine for flexibility, as well as
 serine or threonine for solubility, and can either connect the N-terminus of the VH with the
 C-terminus of the VL, or vice versa. This protein retains the specificity of the original
 immunoglobulin, despite removal of the constant regions and the introduction of the linker.
In some embodiments, the scFV is selected from a large library of randomly generated scFv
proteins and not engineered. Single-chain variable fragments lack the constant Fc region
 found in complete antibody molecules and the common binding sites used to purify proteins.
 Single-chain variable fragments can be produced in bacterial cell cultures, such as E. coli.
The scFvs can be purified can be purified using traditional chromatography or purified by
binding to immobilized using Protein L (which interacts with the variable region of kappa
 light chains). The scFvs can also be purified by a six-histidine tag incorporated at the C
terminus or a Strep II tag at the C or N-terminus of the scFv molecule.
Methods of the invention
 [0072]      Standard techniques can be used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis,
 and tissue culture and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). Enzymatic reactions
 and purification techniques can be performed according to manufacturer's specifications or as
commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The foregoing techniques and
procedures can be generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the
 art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and
 discussed throughout the present specification. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular
 Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring
Harbor, N.Y. (1989)), which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Unless

and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and
commonly used in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses, chemical
analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.
                 Generating Peptide Sequences
[0073]       Peptide sequences can be synthesized or generated using a wide variety of
techniques known in the art. Peptides can be synthesized as peptides in solution or on a solid
support in accordance with conventional techniques. Various automatic synthesizers are
commercially available and can be used in accordance with known protocols. See Stewart
and Young (supra); Tam et al., J Am Chem Soc, 105:6442, (1983); Merrifield, Science
232:341-347 (1986); Barany and Merrifield, The Peptides, Gross and Meienhofer, eds,
Academic Press, New York, 1-284; Barany et al., Int J Pep Protein Res, 30:705-739 (1987).
[0074]       Solid phase peptide synthesis methods can use a copoly(styrene-divinylbenzene)
containing 0.1-1.0 mM amines/g polymer. These methods for peptide synthesis use
butyloxycarbonyl (t-BOC) or 9-fluorenylmethyloxy-carbonyl (FMOC) protection of alpha
amino groups. Both methods involve stepwise syntheses whereby a single amino acid is
added at each step starting from the C-terminus of the peptide. Coligan et al., Curr Prot
Immunol, Wiley Interscience, 1991, Unit 9. On completion of chemical synthesis, the
synthetic peptide can be deprotected to remove the t-BOC or FMOC amino acid blocking
groups and cleaved from the polymer by treatment with acid at reduced temperature (e.g.,
liquid HF-10% anisole for about 0.25 to about 1 hour at 00 C). After evaporation of the
reagents, the peptides are extracted from the polymer with 1% acetic acid solution that is then
lyophilized to yield the crude material. This can normally be purified by such techniques as
gel filtration on Sephadex G-15 using 5% acetic acid as a solvent. Lyophilization of
appropriate fractions of the column will yield the homogeneous peptides or peptide
derivatives, which can then be characterized by such standard techniques as amino acid
analysis, thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, ultraviolet
absorption spectroscopy, molar rotation, solubility, and quantitated by the solid phase Edman
degradation.
[0075]       In other embodiments, phage display techniques can be used for identifying
peptides. A phage library can be prepared (using e.g., lambda phage), displaying inserts of
amino acid residues. The inserts can represent, for example, a completely degenerate or
biased array. Phage-bearing inserts that bind to the desired antigen can be selected, and this
process is repeated through several cycles of reselection of phage that bind to the desired
                                             14

 WO 2014/193632                                                               PCT/US2014/037563
antigen. DNA sequencing can be conducted to identify the sequences of the expressed
peptides. The minimal linear portion of the sequence that binds to the desired antigen can be
determined in this way. The procedure can be repeated using a biased library containing
inserts containing part or all of the minimal linear portion plus one or more additional
degenerate residues upstream or downstream thereof.
[0076]      In another embodiment, ProCode technology including Membrane Anchored
Display target trapping (MAD-Trap) and Functional Ligand Induced target trapping (FLI
Trap) can be used to select binding scFv peptides. See PCT/US2011/028977 and
PCT/US2006/032810, each incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[0077]      These techniques can be used to prepare poly-proline peptide sequences, such as
those described herein: (i) proline rich peptide used by Southwell [7, 8] (PQLPQPPPQAQP)
(SEQ ID NO: 17) and (ii) carboxy derived Huntington's peptide (PGPAVAEEPLHRPG)
(SEQ ID NO: 18).
                Vectors
[0078]      Recombinant Viral Vectors: A viral vector capable of accepting the coding
sequences for the nucleic acid molecule(s) to be expressed can be used in the methods
described herein. For example vectors derived from adenovirus (AV); adeno-associated virus
(AAV); retroviruses (e.g., lentiviruses (LV), Rhabdoviruses, murine leukemia virus); herpes
virus, and the like can be used.
[0079]      Selection of recombinant viral vectors suitable for use in the invention, methods
for inserting nucleic acid sequences for expressing the intrabody sequences into the vector,
and methods of delivering the viral vector to the cells of interest are within the skill in the art.

[0080]      Viral vectors can include those derived from AV and AAV. Suitable AAV
vectors for expressing the intrabody sequences of the invention, methods for constructing the
recombinant AV vector, and methods for delivering the vectors into target cells are described
in Samulski R et al. (1987), J. Virol. 61: 3096-3101; Fisher K J et al. (1996), J. Virol, 70:

 WO 2014/193632                                                              PCT/US2014/037563
                Intrabody Generation and Selection
[0081]      In some embodiments, intrabodies are generated that specifically inhibit an
intracellular HttpQ protein or a protein comprising a polyQ sequence. Intrabodies can be
created that bind to a proline rich peptide or a peptide sequence derived from a Huntingtin
protein. In other embodiments, the intrabody can be selected to bind to an intracellular
protein of any organism. Notably, because of the degree of evolutionary conservation of
functional proteins, enzymes, protein-protein interactions, and signal transduction pathways,
even though the intrabody will preferably be specific for a protein in a cell, it can also be
expected that the intrabody will inhibit a homologous protein in a related species.
[0082]       scFvs commonly exhibit poor stability and solubility when expressed in the
cytoplasm. Techniques have been developed to overcome these difficulties associated with
stable expression of intrabodies. Some strategies are as follows: modifying the cytoplasmic
redox potential of the host strain by mutating components of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin
pathways; performing rounds of mutation and selection to identify scFv sequences that fold
efficiently in an intracellular compartment; and using C-terminal fusions to a mature portion
of E. coli maltose binding protein to stabilize scFvs expressed in the bacterial and
mammalian cytoplasm. In another embodiment, a modified yeast 2-hybrid approach can be
used, where a selectable marker is fused to a target scFv as an antigen-independent reporter
of solubility.
[0083]      In an embodiment, a selection assay by Fisher et al. is used to engineer
intrabodies based on the intrinsic protein folding quality control mechanism of the bacterial
twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway. See Fisheret al. Efficient isolation of soluble
intracellular single-chain antibodies using the twin-arginine translocation machinery (Fisher,
et al, J Mol Biol, 2009. 385(1): p. 299-311). The selection assay employs a tripartite
sandwich fusion of a protein of interest (POI) with an N-terminal Tat-specific signal peptide
(ssTorA) and C-terminal TEMI p-lactamase (Bla), thereby coupling antibiotic resistance
with Tat pathway export. The assay was adapted to develop the intrabody selection after Tat
export assay (ISELATE), a high-throughput selection strategy for facile identification of
solubility-enhanced scFv sequences. This approach is meant to improve substrate solubility,
folding rate, and surface hydrophilicity results in enhanced export by the Tat pathway.
ISELATE provides a method for selecting clones with greatly enhanced Tat export
efficiency.

 WO 2014/193632                                                               PCT/US2014/037563
[0084]      A synthesized library of randomized scFv13 variants can be used as described in
Fisher et al. Amino acid sequence diversity can be introduced into the CDR3H and CDR3L
chains of scFvT3 by randomizing library oligonucleotide DNA. The synthetic library can be
amplified using PCR primers. The synthetic library can be cloned into cells, such as PC314,
to eliminate scFv truncated variants and variants that are not expressed. The scFv expressing
cells can be pooled, and the library is cloned into a vector (e.g., pSALect display vector
(NdeI/NotI)).
[0085]      In some embodiments, spheroblasts are generated that display the scFv library.
For example, wild-type E. coli cells expressing the scFv library can be used and grown.
Expression of the scFv from plasmids can be induced. For example, scFvs from pSALect
based plasmids can be induced with isopropyl p-D-l-thiogalactopyranoside. The spheroplasts
are grown in culture and collected.
[0086]      In an embodiment, the generated scFV library is then analyzed to select for
positive transformants that bind to a biotinylated peptide (e.g., a biotinylated Huntingtin
peptide). In an embodiment, magnetic beads can be used and incubated with the
spheroplasted scFv library and Huntintin peptide. Positive transformants are selected for
plating and grown.
[0087]       The invention provides intrabodies having binding characteristics that have been
improved by direct mutation or methods of affinity maturation. Random mutagenesis can be
used to introduce mutations into the coding sequences of intrabodies. Random mutations
with low mutation frequency can be introduced in the coding sequence of intrabodies by
error-prone PCR using the GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to
the manufacturer's protocol using PCR primers. In other embodiments, methods used for
modifying or increasing affinity and specificity of antibody binding sites consisting of two
variable domains can be applied to intrabodies (See, e.g., Yang et al., J. Mol Biol. 254:392
403 (1995)). For example, libraries binding domains into which diversity has been
introduced can be easily screened for desired binding characteristics using phage display.
Alternatively, yeast surface display can be employed. Intrabodies can be modified or
improved by mutating CDR residues and screening for desired characteristics. In another
embodiment, individual amino acid residues or combinations of residues are randomized so
that in a population of otherwise identical antigen binding sites, subsets of from two to
twenty amino acids are found at particular positions. Alternatively, mutations can be induced
over a range of residues by error prone PCR methods (See, e.g., Hawkins et al., J. Mol Biol.
                                              17

WO 2014/193632                                                                PCT/US2014/037563
226: 889-96 (1992)). In another example, a phage display vector containing a heavy or light
chain variable region gene can be propagated in a mutator strain of E. coli (See, e.g., Low et
al., J. Mol. Biol. 250: 359-68 (1996)). These methods of mutagenesis are illustrative of the
many methods known to one of skill in the art.
                 Binding Assays
[0088]       Binding of an intrabody to a poly-proline peptide sequence or poly-glutamate
protein can be tested using various binding assays. For example, ELISA assays can be
performed to determine the binding activity of isolated scFv clones against a biotinylated
Huntingtin peptide.
[0089]       Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or enzyme immunoassay (EIA), is
a test that uses antibodies and color change to identify a substance. ELISA is a plate-based
assay designed for detecting and quantifying substances such as peptides, proteins, antibodies
and hormones. In an ELISA, an antigen must be immobilized to a solid surface and then
complexed with an antibody that is linked to an enzyme. Detection is accomplished by
assessing the conjugated enzyme activity via incubation with a substrate to produce a
measureable product. The most crucial element of the detection strategy is a highly specific
antibody-antigen interaction. ELISAs are typically performed in 96-well (or 384-well)
polystyrene plates, which will passively bind antibodies and proteins.
[0090]       Various other peptide binding assays known in the art may be used to test the
binding of an intrabody to a peptide sequence or protein of interest.
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention
[0091]       Methods for treatment of poly-Q diseases, such as Huntington's disease, are also
encompassed by the present invention. Said methods of the invention include administering
a therapeutically effective amount of intrabody, such as INT41. The intrabodies of the
invention can be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions can
comprise, in addition to one or more of the intrabodies, a pharmaceutically acceptable
excipient, carrier, buffer, stabiliser or other materials well known to those skilled in the art.
Such materials should be non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active
ingredient. The precise nature of the carrier or other material can depend on the route of
administration, e.g. oral, intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous, nasal, intramuscular,
intraperitoneal routes.

Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally include a liquid carrier such as water,
petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or synthetic oil. Physiological saline
solution, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene
glycol or polyethylene glycol can be included.
[0093]       For intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, or injection at the site of
affliction, the active ingredient will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous
solution which is pyrogen-free and has suitable pH, isotonicity and stability. Those of
relevant skill in the art are well able to prepare suitable solutions using, for example, isotonic
vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Lactated Ringer's Injection.
Preservatives, stabilizers, buffers, antioxidants and/or other additives can be included, as
required.
[0094]       Whether it is an intrabody, peptide, or other pharmaceutically useful compound
according to the present invention that is to be given to an individual, administration is
preferably in a "therapeutically effective amount" or "prophylactically effective amount"(as
the case can be, although prophylaxis can be considered therapy), this being sufficient to
show benefit to the individual. The actual amount administered, and rate and time-course of
administration, will depend on the nature and severity of protein aggregation disease being
treated. Prescription of treatment, e.g. decisions on dosage etc, is within the responsibility of
general practitioners and other medical doctors, and typically takes account of the disorder to
be treated, the condition of the individual patient, the site of delivery, the method of
administration and other factors known to practitioners. Examples of the techniques and
protocols mentioned above can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th
edition, Osol, A. (ed), 1980.

         Methods for Preventing Aggregation of Poly-Glutamate Protein in a Cell Using
         Intrabodies
[0096]      Methods are provided for preventing aggregation of a poly-glutamine (polyQ)
protein in a cell. The method includes introducing into the cell an intrabody described
herein, such as INT41, A2, H8 or E1O. In some embodiments, introducing the intrabody into
the cell can be performed by transfection. The cell is maintained for a time sufficient for the
intrabody to bind to a polyQ protein, thereby preventing aggregation of polyQ proteins in the
cell.
[0097] Methods are also provided for preventing gene dysregulation caused by aggregation
of a poly-glutamine (polyQ) protein in a cell. The method includes introducing into said cell
the intrabody described herein and maintaining the cell for a time sufficient for the intrabody
to bind to the polyQ protein, thereby preventing gene dysregulation of one or more genes in
the cell. Exemplary genes targeted for preventing dysregulation are listed in Table 8 of U.S.

         Methods For Treating Diseases Caused By Aggregation Of A Poly-Glutamate
         Protein
[0098]      In one aspect, the invention relates in particular to the use of an intrabody or a
pharmaceutical composition prepared therefrom for the treatment or prevention of cognitive
or behavioral conditions associated with a poly-glutamate associated disease, such as
Huntington's disease. An intrabody according to the invention or a pharmaceutical
composition prepared therefrom can enhance the quality of life, particularly in a patient being
treated with for Huntington's disease.
[0099]      The invention furthermore also relates to the use of an intrabody or a
pharmaceutical composition thereof for treating Huntington's disease, in combination with
other pharmaceuticals and/or other therapeutic methods, e.g., with known pharmaceuticals
and/or known therapeutic methods, such as, for example, those which are currently employed
for treating Huntington's disease. For example, the use of an intrabody or a pharmaceutical
composition thereof can be combined with conventional medications and treatments that
lessen symptoms of movement and psychiatric disorders (e.g., Xenazine@, which provides
temporary relief of chorea).

Example 1: Identification of Novel Intrabodies
[00102]     Novel candidates were designed using an alanine replacement strategy in the
Intrabody complementarity determining region (CDR) to identify critical amino acids and
subsequent mutagenesis for affinity maturation. ProCode technology including Membrane
Anchored Display target trapping (MAD-Trap) and Functional Ligand Induced target
trapping (FLI-Trap) are the methods used to select binding scFv peptides. See
PCT/US2011/028977 and PCT/US2006/032810, the disclosures of which are incorporated by
reference in their entireties.
[00103]     Known intrabodies, such as HappI and Happ It, have difficulties with solubility
and thus cannot be used effectively in therapeutics or treatments. Efforts to enhance
solubility by mutagenesis were unsuccessful for Happi and Happ It. New intrabodies were
developed using a proline rich peptide described by Patterson et al. [12-15] as a capture
source for binders, followed by ELISA binding assays, to initially characterize binders.
INT41 and similar intrabodies were developed from naive libraries of scFv sequences using
technology initially developed in the DeLisa laboratory at Cornell University [16-19].
Binders were then tested in many of the same cell-based and animal models used by the
Caltech group with Happ 1 as a positive control. In animal studies performed by
                                             21

PsychoGenics, the leading provider of animal model testing in Huntington's, INT41 was
found to be superior to Happ It in its ability to show improvement in a number of motor
function and cognitive tests. Pathology results demonstrated that INT41 reduced the
formation of small aggregates, while Happ It increased aggregation suggesting that the
limited solubility of Happ It may contribute to pathology at some point in disease
progression. Provided below are example methods for identification of INT41 and selected
intrabodies.
                Peptide Synthesis:
[00104]     Peptides were synthesized by a custom peptide synthesis service (Biomatic,
Delaware). The following peptides were used: (i) proline rich peptide used by Southwell [13,
 14] (PQLPQPPPQAQP, SEQ ID NO: 17) and (ii) carboxy derived Huntington's peptide
(PGPAVAEEPLHRPG, SEQ ID NO: 18). The peptides were generated with a carboxy
terminal biotin to facilitate selection on Strepavidin coated beads and ELISA plates.
                scFv Library (T3) Construction
[00105]     The synthetic library design was based on the T3 framework [16]. Amino acid
sequence diversity was introduced into the CDR3H and CDR3L chains of scFvT3 by
randomizing library oligonucleotide DNA.        CDR3H was engineered with an NNK length
yielding 7, 10 or 13 amino acids. CDR3L was engineered with an NNK length of 5, 8 or 10
amino acids. The library (GeneArt) comprised 1.54x101 1 molecules.
[00106]     The synthetic library was amplified using PCR primers listed below:

              GCCAGTTTGG         (SEQ ID NO:20)
[00107]     The synthetic library was cloned into PC314 (Xbal/Notl) to eliminate scFv
truncated variants and variants that are not expressed. The scFv expressing cells were
pooled and the library cloned into the pSALect display vector (NdeI/NotI).
                Preparation of Spheroplasts
[00108]     Wild-type E. coli (Lucigen E.cloni 1OG) and E. coli cells expressing the T3
combinatorial scFv library were grown in 25 ml LB medium containing chloramphenicol (20
pg/mL) for 1.5 h at 370 C. Expression of scFvs from pSALect-based plasmids was induced

with isopropyl p-D-l-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 1.0 mM). Following induction, cell
flasks were shifted to room temperature for overnight growth. The OD600 of each culture
was measured and the volume corresponding to 1 x 1010 cells added to a 1.5 ml
microcentrifuge tube. Cell pellets were gently washed with 500 pL of ice-cold fractionation
buffer (0.1 M Tris, 0.75 M sucrose, buffer pH 8.0) and resuspended in 350 pl, of ice-cold
fractionation buffer supplemented with lysozyme (1 mg/mL). Cells were slowly vortexed,
700 pL of EDTA (1 mM, pH 8.0) was added dropwise, and tubes were incubated at room
temperature for 20 min. After adding 50 pl of cold MgCl (0.5 M), tubes were incubated on
ice for 10 min and then spun down (6000 rpm) for 10 min at 4'C. The supernatant was
carefully removed, and the spheroplasts resuspended in 1 mL of ice-cold PBS.
                Panning the T3 scFv library
[00109]     In one example, the generated scFV library was analyzed to select for positive
transformants that bind to the biotinylated Huntingtin peptide. Pierce Streptavidin Magnetic
Beads (25 pl, Thermo Scientific) were washed with phosphate buffered saline and mixed
with 70 pl of E. coli wild-type spheroplasts to minimize non-specific binding of our T3 scFv
library. Phosphate buffered saline (930 pl) was added to bring the volume in the
microcentrifuge to 1 ml. The beads were incubated overnight with shaking at 4'C. The
spheroplasted T3 scFv library (130 pl) was mixed with biotinylated Huntingtin peptide
(RPQLPQPPPQAQPRGGGSK; SEQ ID NO:25) at a concentration of 4.5 pM, 45 pM and
 100 pM. The volume in each microcentrifuge tube was brought up to 1 ml with PBS. The
T3 spheroplasted scFv library was incubated with the Huntingtin peptide overnight with
shaking at 4'C (spheroplast:Ag complex). Following incubation at 4'C overnight, the
magnetic beads were captured, washed with 1 ml PBS and mixed with the spheroplast:Ag
complex. The mixture was incubated for an additional 30 minutes at 4'C. The
Ag:spheroplast complex was captured with magnetic force, washed with phosphate buffered
saline containing 300 mM NaCl and 0.015% Tween and resuspended in 50 pl Elution Buffer
(Quiagen). The sample was boiled at 95'C for 5 minutes, cooled to 4'C and subsequently
dialyzed against H20 for 30 minutes. 100 ng of DNA was transformed into E.coli 1OG
Electrocompetent cells (Lucigen) for amplification. Cultures were incubated with shaking at
37oC for 1 hour. Positive transformants were selected for by plating on LB agar containing
chloramphenicol and growing overnight at 37'C.

                 Random Mutagenesis
[00110]     Random mutagenesis was used to introduce mutations into the coding sequences
of intrabodies. Random mutations with low mutation frequency were introduced in the
coding sequence of intrabodies by error-prone PCR using the GeneMorph II Random
Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol using PCR primers:

[00111]     PCR conditions were chosen to obtain a mutation rate of 1-5 mutations per 1000
base pairs. The 4 PCR mixtures each consisted of 5 pL of 1OX Mutazyme II reaction buffer,
 1 pL of 40 mM mutagenic dNTP mix (200 pM each final), 0.5 pL of forward and reverse
primer master mix (250ng/pl of each primer), 1 pL of Mutazyme II DNA polymerase (2.5
U/pL), and 0.7 ng of intrabody template in a total volume of 50 pL. The amplified DNA was
purified using a QlAquick PCR Purification Kit. The purified product was then digested with
restriction enzymes NotI and NdeI and cloned into plasmid vector pSALect. Ligation was
achieved by adding T4 DNA ligase to the PCR product and pSALect vector for 1 hr. The
recombinant plasmids were each transformed into E. coli 1OG Electrocompetent cells
(Lucigen) for amplification. Cultures were incubated with shaking at 37 0 C for 1 hour.
Positive transformants were selected for by plating on LB agar containing chloramphenicol
and growing overnight at 37 0 C. The following day, 5 ml LB medium was added to each
plate, the cells were scraped off, and the intrabody mutagenesis clones pooled.
                 Clonini
[00112]     Positive hits screened by ELISA (end-point dilution) were miniprepped, and
plasmid DNA cut with NotI/NdeI. The ~0.75-kb Notl/Ndel DNA fragment was cloned into
the multiple cloning site of pET 24a generating a C-terminus Strep-tag fusion construct. The
recombinant vector was subsequently transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for protein
expression analysis. For cell-based assays, the positive hits screened by ELISA were
miniprepped and the plasmid DNA used as template in a PCR reaction. PCR primers PC147

ligated into the multiple cloning site of pOptiVEC. pOptiVEC was also used for all cell
based expression of scFvs which were PCR amplified from pSALect and ligated into
pOptiVEC at the NheI and Xhol sites.
                ELISA
         ELISA was performed to determine the binding activity of isolated scFv clones
against biotinylated Huntingtin peptide designated Happ(+) (RPQLPQPPPQAQPRGGGSK
biotin (SEQ ID NO: 26), and a second biotinylated Huntingtin peptide designated Happ(-)
(PGPAVAEEPLHRPG-biotin (SEQ ID NO: 28). All incubations except antigen coating
were carried out at room temperature. Microtiter plates (Nuc) were coated with 100 Pl of a
biotinlyated Huntingtin peptide solution (2 pg/ml in 50 mM NaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.6) and
incubated overnight at 4'C. The plates were washed 3 times with 200 Pl of 1 x TBS (50 mM
Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl pH 8.0) and blocked with 100 pl of 2% milk in TBS for 2 hr. Plates
were washed once with 200 pl of 1 x TBS. In some experiments, preblocked Strepavidin
coated plates (Pierce) were used to bind biotinylated peptide. Cell extracts (50 pl) or purified
StreplI tagged Intrabodies were added to the antigen-coated blocked plates and incubated for
 1.5 hr. Extracts of E. coli cultures from individual colonies selected by panning after
overnight induction with IPTG were prepared by lysis in B-Per (Pierce) as described by the
manufacturer and centrifuged at 10,000 X g for 10 minutes to remove cell wall and debris.
Supernatants from these extracts were used directly or diluted with TBS (1:2, 1:4) prior to
use. Plates were washed 5 x with 200 pl of 1 x TBST (50 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl,
Tween 20 pH 8.0). Next, 100 pl of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-FLAG
tagged (Sigma) antibody was added and incubated for 1.5 hr. The plate was washed 5 x with
200 pl of 1 x TBST and 1 x with 200 pl of 1 x TBS. After washing, 100 Pl of 3,3',5,5'
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was added. The peroxidase reaction was stopped after an
appropriate time by the addition of 100 pl of 2M H2SO4. The optical density (OD) was
measured at 405 nm on a spectrophotometer and the level of scFv binding determined.

analysis by flow cytometry cells were release by treatment with 0.05% Trypsin / EDTA
followed by dilution into Opti-MEM in 10% serum then washed in the same medium by
centrifugation 3 times.
[00114]     For each transfection sample, the following steps were performed:
[00115]      a. Diluted 0.2 pg pQ103 DNA with /without 0.8 ug scFv DNA in 50 PL of Opti

Lipofectamine. Mix gently and incubate for additional 20 - 30 minutes at room temperature.
[00118]      d. Added DNA/Lipofectamine complex to 293T cell, mix gently and incubate at
37oC to ~40 hrs. (Culture can be moved to 320 C after 16 hrs incubation at 370 C to slow
down growth and maintain monolayer).
[00119]      Counting of the GFP punta was performed by microscopy and/or flow cytometry
(Coulter Epics Analyzer) following harvest of 293T cells 24-40 hours following transfection.

[00120]     Brains from R6/2 mice as above were performed at 12 weeks as described below.
[00121]     Perfusion Methods: Animals were anesthetized using Sodium Pentobarbital i.p.
(100mg/kg BW). Next, mice were transcardially perfused using a peristaltic pump and were
perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0. IM PBS (pH=7.4) on ice. The brains were
then removed from skull and post-fixed overnight at 4 0 C. The brains were then stored at 40 C
in 0. IM PBS containing 0.01% Sodium Azide until the time of shipment to NeuroScience
Associates.
[00122]      Sections were prepared by Neuroscience Associates (Knoxville, TN) using
MultiBrain® technology. Twenty five (25) Mouse Brains were embedded together per

length). All cut sections were collected into an antigen preservation solution.
Immunohistochemistry was performed with the EM-48 monoclonal antibody to reveal HTT
aggregates for every sixth section, at 210pm intervals, yielding -57 slides per block (-57
stained sections per Mouse Brain, -2850 stained sections total).

Example 2: Identification of INT41 Intrabody
[00123]     Intrabodies were selected using MAB-Trap as described [18] using the poly
proline peptide PRP.
[00124]     Following an initial round of selection, scFvs were selected as described on
Strepavidin coated beads following incubation with spheroplasts using two rounds of
selection at 4.5 pM, 45 pM, 100 pM of biotinlyated peptide at 40'C overnight. Four positive
hits were then subjected to random PCR mutagenesis. Following another round of selection
and enrichment using 0.5 pM biotinylated peptide at 40'C for 1 hour, a final group four
scFvs (INT41 (SEQ ID NO:1), A2 (SEQ ID NO:2), E10 (SEQ ID NO:3) and H8(SEQ ID
NO:4)) were selected based on ELISA results.
[00125]     A group of final selected scFvs were PCR cloned with a 3'(carboxy terminal)
StreplI tag into pET24 vector and transformed into E. coli. E. coli clones were selected on
antibiotic, sequenced to verify insert and up to 1 L cultures were prepared and induced at
approximately 0.2 OD 600 with IPTG and continued in shaking culture (300 rpm) overnight
before harvest at from 10-20 OD 600. Pelleted cells were microfluidized (M 10Y,
Microfluidics Corporation) following dilution of 10-20X by volume into TBS 5 mM EDTA
before clarification at 10,000 x G by centrifugation, then purified on a StrepTactin Sepharose
High Performance Column (GE Life Sciences). The column was washed and eluted as
described by the manufacturer.
[00126]     Purified scFvs were screened by ELISA with both biotinylated PRP

rich peptide derived from a downstream sequence from the Huntingtin protein
(PGPAVAEEPLHRPG-biotin; SEQ ID NO: 28). Happ(+) is the peptide sequence
PQLPQPPPQAQP (SEQ ID NO: 17). Happ(-) is the peptide sequence PGPAVAEEPLHRP
(SEQ ID NO: 18). Happ(+) and Happ(-) were derived from the Huntingtin exonI protein
sequence. The Huntingtin exon 1 protein includes the following sequences for a N terminal
region (MATLEKLMKAFESLKSFQQQQ(Q)n) (SEQ ID NO: 29), a poly-proline region
(PPPPPPPPPPPQLPQPPPQAQPLLPQPQ (underline is Happ(+)) (SEQ ID NO: 30), and a C
terminal P-rich region (PPPPPPPPPPGPABAEEPLHRPK (underline is Happ(-)); SEQ ID
NO: 31). The Happ(+) and Happ(-) peptides were used in an ELISA binding assay with
intrabodies INT41, A2, H8 and E10.
[00127]     Both poly-proline peptides were specifically and equally recognized by all scFvs
including the Happlt scFv [13-15], suggesting that the specificity lies in the common

recognition of primarily a proline sequence PGP (Happ(-)) or PQP (Happ (+)) that introduces
structure disruption into sequences [20] separated by any single amino acid. This PXP
sequence is a common recognition element of proline-rich regions which plays a significant
role in intracellular signaling [21]. The HappIt protein is predominately found in the
inclusion bodies, but refolding was not successful and it could only be assayed in lysate form
where adequate solubility could be maintained.
[00128]      In FIGs. la-Id, the binding of the selected intrabodies to the poly-proline peptides
are shown. The vertical axis is expressed as OD units at A=404 nM and the horizontal axis is
the concentration (nM) of purified intrabody. FIG. la shows binding for INT41 (SEQ ID
NO: 1). FIG. lb shows binding for A2 (SEQ ID NO: 2). FIG. Ic shows binding for E10
(SEQ ID NO: 3). FIG.1d shows binding for H8 (SEQ ID NO: 4). INT41 was the strongest
binder, showing higher optical density units at higher intrabody concentration.
[00129]      Although H8 was only weakly positive in binding when purified, it demonstrated
three times the signal when assayed in lysate form, even though it was expressed at
approximately the same levels as INT4 1. H8 recovery in the purified format was
comparatively low. H8 may be unstable in purified form and could aggregate resulting in
lower signal. This may explain its ability to block in the cell-based assay where intracellular
concentrations of all the intrabodies tested are comparable.

Example 3: Intrabodies Prevent Aggregation of HttpQ Protein
[00133]     In certain embodiments, the effect of the intrabodies on HttpQ protein aggregation
was tested.
[00134]     DNA vectors containing HttpQ were fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP)
and introduced into cells by transfection with or without nucleic acid molecules encoding the
selected intrabodies [8]. Aggregation of the HttpQ protein was observed by fluorescent
microscopy and flow cytometry.

 WO 2014/193632                                                             PCT/US2014/037563
[00135]      In flow cytometry, better quantification was achieved through the analysis of tens
of thousands of cells in minutes. In FIG. 4, flow cytometry analysis of INT41 and similar
PRP specific intrabodies shows inhibition of HttpQ aggregation. The number of cells was
plotted on the Y axis and the log fluorescence on the X axis. In a control group, 293T cells
(FIG. 4A) were not transfected. In the absence of HttpQ-GFP (Control, 293T) fluorescence
is not observed (<100). A non-aggregating HttpQ30-GFP (PQ30) shows fluorescence mostly
in the first and second decade of the fluorescence scale. In FIG. 4C, the aggregating
HttpQ103-GFP (PQ 103) shows a dramatic and significant shift to the highest decade of
fluorescence. Separate cultures of 293T cells were transfected with 1-4 pg of a PQ30-GFP
(FIG. 4B) or transfected with a PQ103-GFP-containing lentiviral vector (FIG. 4C) [8].
PQ103 + Intrabody (FIG. 4D) received PQ103-GFP plus 1-4 pg of HappIt cDNA cloned into
the OptiVec vector (Life Sciences, Carlsbad CA) under control of the CMV promoter.
Fluorescence was monitored on a Coulter FACS Scan. Flow cytometry assay was performed,
and PRR specific intrabodies reduced the fluorescence in the third decade by up to 20 fold
and demonstrated a dramatic decrease in fluorescence signal between that of untransfected
controls and PQ30-GFP. These experiments were repeated six timesdue to variation in
transfection efficiency. FIG. 5 shows the results tabulated for the groups tested (control,
PQ30, PQ103, PQ103 + HappIt and PQ103+INT41). Samples 5 and 6 are two variants of
E1O, one of which has a single amino acids change in a nonbinding framework region.
[00136]      In fluorescence microscopy experiments, HttpQ30 showed diffuse cytoplasmic
staining characteristic of protein distribution throughout the cytoplasm, while HttpQ 103
demonstrated punctate staining or bright spots of fluorescence in the cytoplasm indicative of
aggregation which were inhibited in the presence of INT41 (data not shown). When Happit,
INT41 and other intrabodies targeting the same sequence as Happ It were co-expressed with
HttpQ103-GFP, fluorescence in the highest decade was dramatically reduced, as seen in FIG.
4 as a shift in fluorescence to an intermediate distribution between the 293T control and
PQ30 (PQ103+Intrabody).
        Example 4: INT41 Prevents Gene Dysregulation
[00137]      In another example, experiments were performed to test the effect of intrabodies
on gene dysregulation.
[00138]       In one example, mRNA was extracted from cells, and the levels of gene
expression for 29,000 genes was measured (performed by Phalanx One Array). These data
were analyzed on large microarrays for gene expression levels in the various samples. The
                                               30

 WO 2014/193632                                                              PCT/US2014/037563
data were analyzed using Integrity Systems software for disease association, pathway
analysis, and similar features of intracellular networks. This analysis revealed that the gene
expression patterns for HttpQ (PQ 103) are consistent with those from Huntington's animal
models and samples from human neurons taken at autopsy. The data also demonstrated
subsets of genes that are increased or decreased in expression level (data not shown).
[00139]     Cells expressing PQ103 or PQ103 + INT41 were analyzed for over-expression or
under-expression of selected genes. In samples taken from PQ103 + INT41-expressing cells,
both the over- and under-expression pattern changes caused by the PQ103 aggregating
phenotype were largely prevented for the genes most affected.
[00140]     Examples of some of the genes with altered expression in Huntington's with
altered expression is prevented by intrabodies of the invention are listed in Table 2 below,
along with the fold expression changes. Other genes that are dysregulated in Huntington's
and whose dysregulation is inhibited by intrabodies of the invention are involved in
mitochondrial function, clathrin coated pit transport, membrane transport and other genes that
lead to progressive neuron dysfunction and neuron death. An exemplary list of genes that
were increased in expression 2X or decreased in expression 0.5X (649 genes) are also found
in the Appendix (Table 8) of U.S. Provisional Application 61/871,288 filed on Aug. 28,
2013, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. A total of 29,000 genes were tested.
In an embodiment, the genes are tested with Rosetta Biosoftware that uses a proprietary
proprietary system for calculating fold changes by incorporating weighed error. The
calculations for the list of genes are shown in Table 8 of U.S. Provisional Application
61/871,288 filed on Aug. 28, 2013, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
[00141]     In FIG. 6, INT41 was shown to inhibit the over-expression of genes caused by
PQ103. The reduction in the fold expression of representative over-expressed genes is shown
between cells expressing PQ103 alone or PQ103 and INT41. The mRNA was isolated from
up to 2 X 106 cells and sent to Phalanx One Array Sciences for QC and microRNA using
Kreatech T M labeling. The mRNA was probed against arrays of 29,000 genes in triplicate.
The results were analyzed by Rosetta Resolver software.
[00142]     FIG. 7 shows the effects of INT41 on the under-expression of genes caused by
PQ103. The increase in the fold expression of representative under-expressed genes is shown
between cells expressing PQ 103 alone or PQ 103 and INT4 1.
[00143]     These FACS and gene expression results, taken together, demonstrate that INT41
prevents both the aggregation phenotype (FIGs. 4-5) as well as the genotype (gene
                                              31

dysregulation, FIGs. 6-7) that are both characteristic of Huntington's disease and linked by
cause and effect.
[00144]    Table 2 shows gene expression data for a few selected genes, which reveal that
expression of INT41 alone does not result in pleiotropic gene regulation. The data show
some of the genes affected by PQ103, specifically those involved in heat shock or protein
folding pathways, as well as degradation.

[00146]      The data in Table 2 demonstrate that INT41 alone alters only the expression of
genes required for synthesis and degradation of proteins, which would be expected for the
added requirements in cells expressing INT41.
         Example 5: INT41 Prevents a Toxic Fragment of the Mutant Huntingtin Protein
         from Binding to Chromatin in the Nucleus
[00147]      In another example, INT41 was studied in PC12 cells with an inducible gene for
full length human Huntingtin protein for its effect on the sub-cellular localization and activity
of mutant Huntingtin and its fragments.
[00148]      PC12 rat neuron cells, initially developed at the Huntington's Disease Foundation
(CHDI), were selected because similar inducible PC 12 neurons were used by other
laboratories that characterized toxic Huntingtin fragments (11).
[00149]      FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram of the construction of a rAAV (Chen, H. Mol Ther,
2008. 16(5): 924-30. The INT41 cDNA gene sequence was placed downstream from a
cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and a human growth hormone (hGH) intron. The SV40
polyadenylation sequence (SV40 polyA) was placed downstream of the INT41 cDNA. The
entire expression cassette was flanked by AAV6 inverted terminal repeat sequences (ITRs)
required for vector packaging. A schematic of the expression cassette region of the vector is
provided as FIG. 8. The AAV rep coding sequence was engineered to contain an artificial
intron comprising an insect promoter so that both the Rep78 and Rep52 proteins required for
AAV replication and packaging can be expressed from a single sequence. In addition, the
artificial intron was also engineered into the AAV cap coding sequence to enable the
expression of VP1, VP2, and VP3 proteins required to form viral particles in an optimal ratio.
The engineered Rep and Cap sequences were cloned together to generate a recombinant
baculovirus that expresses both the AAV Rep and Cap proteins. A second baculovirus was
engineered to contain the target sequence flanked by the AAV ITRs. These two
baculoviruses were used to co-infect insect cells for AAV vector production. After co
infection and amplification, the cell pellet is collected, lysed, cleared, and subjected to 2
rounds of cesium chloride ultracentrifugation. The AAV vectors are buffer-exchanged to PBS
buffer or other suitable buffer depending on the requirement of the study. The titer of the

AAV vectors was determined by a quantitative real-time PCR method, as known to those of
skill in the art.
[00150]      FIG. 9 demonstrates that in PC 12 cells expressing HttpQ of 73 repeats, INT41
dramatically reduced the binding of the mutant Huntingtin protein fragment to chromatin in
the nucleus and reduced the accumulation of full length mutant Huntingtin on membrane.
Cells were transduced with recombinant INT41 containing adeno-associated virus 6 (rAAV6
INT41) and were induced to express human Huntingtin proteins after 72 hours. Cells were
harvested on day 8, following induction of the human Huntingtin gene and sub-cellular
fractionation was performed as described by the kit manufacturer (Thermo 78840). Protein
concentration of each fraction determined using microBCA kit (Thermo 23235).
[00151]      For analysis, 12 ug total protein from each fraction was loaded onto a 3-8% Tris
Acetate gel and run at 30 mAmps for 4 hours. Gel was subsequently transferred onto
nitrocellulose (0.2 um, BioTraceNT) in Transfer Buffer (192 mM Tris, 25 mM Glycine, 20%
Methanol) 30 V for 2 hours. The membrane was blocked in TBST/5% milk overnight and
then probed with a rabbit-anti-Htt (Sigma H7540) antibody at 1:1500 in TBST/5% milk for 4
hrs RT. Three ten-minute washes with TBST preceded incubation with a goat-anti-rabbit
IgG antibody conjugated to HRP (Jackson 111-035-003) at 1:5,000 in TBST/5% milk for 1 hr
at room temperature. Three ten-minute washes with TBST were done prior to application of
Pierce ECL2 (Thermo 80196) for chemiluminescent detection on film.
[00152]      FIG. 10 shows that the transcriptional regulatory CREB binding is increased in
HttQ73 chromatin/DNA fraction and that INT41 decreases CREB binding to
chromatin/DNA. Immunoblots shown in FIG. 9 were re-probed with anti-CREB antibody
(mock transduced with AAV6 ("M"), but binding of CREB to chromatin/DNA was reduced
when cells were transduced with rAAV6-INT41 (lane marked as "41"). Lanes contain
fractions from cytoplasmic (Cyto), membrane (Mem), nuclear soluble (Nsol) or
chromatin/DNA (Chro) from cell lysates from induced PC12Q73 cells that were transduced
with either AAV6 not containing INT41 (M) or with rAAV6-INTT41.
[00153]      FIG. 11 shows an affinity purification of INT41 specific Htt degradation
fragments, in particular an affinity purification of induced and uninduced lysates at days 8-11
on immobilized INT41 Sepharose. FIG. 11 demonstrates that when lysates from HttQ73
induced cells (right columns) are passed through an immobilized-INT41 affinity column,
only smaller fragments of degraded Htt are bound (fractions probed with rabbit anti-N
terminal Htt antibody) and uninduced HttQ73 cells (left columns (days 8, 9, 10, 11) do not

2.5 glycine were spiked with 5 ug cytochrome C, then 100 ul of each was mixed with 400 ul
cold acetone and incubated at -80' C for 10 min and -20' C overnight, and microfuged at 4' C
at 14,000 X g for 10 min. Fractions were run on a 12% SDS PAGE gel, transferred to
nitrocellulose and probed with anti-N-terminal Htt, followed by goat anti-rabbit-HRP and
ECL development. Fractions 8-11 were run following a survey of fractions to determine
which fractions contained eluted Htt or its fragments.
        Example 6: INT41 Binds to Human Tau Protein at Hyperphosphorylated
        Regions for Treatment of Alzheimer's
[00154]     In other embodiments, INT41 can bind to the human Tau protein. FIG. 12 shows
the Human Tau protein sequence, including 9 splice variants. INT41 epitopes are highlighted
in bold and peptides associated with exosomes are outlined in boxes. FIG. 12 shows the
INT41 epitopes ("PxP" in bold) which are the hyperphosphorlyated region of the Tau
protein; the INT41 epitopes bind to sequences that are secreted in exosomes (FIG. 12 shows
boxed sequences) (Pooler, et al. EMBO Reports 2113, 14:389-394; Saman et al. JBC 2012,
287:3842-3849).
[00155]     INT41 can bind to fragments of HttpQ and alter the pathology and degradation of
these fragments. Similarly, INT4 1's binding to fragments of Tau secreted by exosomes that
cause neuron pathology and neuron loss can stabilize those fragments, facilitate degradation
within the cell and prevent the secretion of Tau fragments in exosomes. Alternatively,
although nor mutually exclusive, INT41 may be transported in exosomes bound to toxic Tau
fragments and neutralize their extracellular activity.
[00156]     Fragments of the Tau protein are secreted from cells in Alzheimer's patients, and
Tau fragments bind to cellular receptors and cause neuron dysfunction. Introduction of an
antibody in the extracellular space can be an effective therapy against Alzheimer's based on
animal model studies because the antibody can prevent the binding of the Tau fragment to
cellular receptors that cause neuron dysfunction (see Griswold-Prenner; Irene et al., U.S. Pub.
No. 2001/40086921). Preventing the secretion and/or hyperphosphorylation with an
intrabody, such as INT41, can bind the Tau fragment to cellular receptors and prevent neuron
dysfunction.
[00157]     The invention comprises a method of treating or managing a subject having
Alzheimer's disease or other Tau pathologies, comprising administering to a subject in need
of such treatment or management a therapeutically effective amount of the intrabodies

described herein. In an embodiment, the intrabody prevents binding of a Tau fragment to
neurons causing neuron dysfunction.
         Example 7: INT41 Improves Cognitive and Behavioral Function in Animal
         Models
[00158]     In another example, the INT41 intrabody was studied for effects on cognitive and
behavioral function in animal models.
[00159]     The R6/2 murine model was chosen because it is transgenic for HttpQ with large
polyQ tracts (> 120 repeats). This is an aggressive or acute model that provides the ability to
test in shorter periods of time and is generally accepted as one of the best models for testing
neuroprotective or disease modifying therapeutic drugs.
[00160]     Mice are born with aggregates of HttpQ and continue to accumulate HttpQ with
age. Therapeutic intervention began at 5 weeks of age with optimal expression of transgenes
2-3 weeks post treatment. Therefore, therapeutic intervention takes place well into disease
progression in the R6/2 model. The INT41 sequence was introduced with a recombinant
adeno-associated virus (rAAV Type 6). Wild-type AAV is not associated with disease, and
recombinant AAV vectors have been modified to deliver encoded transgenes and are
incapable of viral replication. AAV is highly tropic for neurons, making it an ideal delivery
system for neurodegenerative diseases.
[00161]     Recombinant AAV6-INT41 (rAAV6-INT41, along with rAAV6-GFP and rAAV
HappI as controls) were administered by interstriatal bilateral injection of 1.5 Pl each in
transgenic animals along with a nontransgenic R6/2 group that received only vehicle (buffer
used for injection). Animal testing was blind to the trained tester and recorded for each
animal for all movement and cognitive related tests. rAAV6 administration at 5 weeks
resulted in optimal expression 2-3 weeks post administration (INT41, GFP and HappI
estimated optimal expression at between 7 and 8 weeks). Table 3 below shows the groups
studied and number of female and male subjects in each group.

[00162]     A number of standard tests were run before the introduction of rAAV at 5 weeks
of age, and these tests were continued until the animals were sacrificed after 12 weeks for
pathology.

[00163]     Various tests are defined below. Rotarod (RR): Mice are tested over 3
consecutive days. Each daily session includes a training trial of 5 minutes (min) at 4 RPM on
the rotarod apparatus (Rotamex, OH). One hour later, the animals were tested for 3
consecutive accelerating trials of 5 min each during which speed changes over 300 seconds.
The inter-trial interval was at least 30 min. The latency to fall from the accelerating rod was
recorded, and quantitative analysis was performed.
[00164]     Open field (OFAM): Activity chambers (Med Associates Inc, St Albans, VT; 27 x
27 x 20.3 cm) were equipped with infrared (IR) beams. Mice were placed in the center of the
chamber, and their behavior was recorded for 30 min. Quantitative analysis was performed
                                              37

 WO 2014/193632                                                                PCT/US2014/037563
on the following five dependent measures: total locomotion, locomotion in the center of the
open field, rearing rate in the center, total rearing frequency and velocity.
[00165]      Grip strength (GS): Grip strength was used to assess muscular strength in both the
forelimb and hindlimb muscles. In brief, mice were scruffed, held gently by the tail, and
were lowered towards the first mesh grip piece on the gauge (Chatillion Force Gauge, San
Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA) until the animal grabbed with both front paws. The
animal was then lowered toward the platform and gently pulled straight back with consistent
force until it released its grip at which point its hindlimbs grasped the second mesh grip
piece, continuing the gentle pulling motion until the subject released its grasp Both the
forelimb and hindlimb grip forces were recorded on the strain gauge. Animals underwent 5
trials per testing session, and the average of the trails was used to calculate the grip force.
After testing, animals were placed back into their home cage.
[00166]      Clasping Test: The clasping test was used to observe clasping of the forelimbs and
hindlimbs while suspended by the tail. Mice were picked up at the end of their tail and held
for 30 seconds, approximately 12 inches above the cage. During the elapsed time, if toes of
the opposing limbs interlock and remain clasped for greater than one second, it is scored as a
clasp and categorized as forelimb, hindlimb or full clasp (both forelimb and hindlimb). After
30 seconds, mice were lowered back into their home cage.
[00167]      Procedural T-Maze: Mice were tested in two T-mazes constructed of black
Plexiglas (built in-house at PsychoGenics, Inc.). Each T-maze was located in a separate test
room, dimly-lit and equipped with a video camera (mounted above the T-maze) and a
computer and monitor. The monitor screen was covered with a red transparent film to
minimize light emission. The T-maze was filled with water at 25'C+/-loC, colored with
Tempura non-toxic white paint to render it opaque. At one end of the cross-piece of the 'T', a
platform was located approximately 0.5 cm below the level of the water.
[00168]      Mice were placed in the stem of the T-shaped maze and allowed to make a choice
to swim into either the right or left arm to reach an escape platform. A choice was defined as
entry into either the left or right arm, without necessarily reaching the escape platform.
Failure to leave the stem of the T-maze was defined as 'no-choice'. Any mouse that failed to
reach the platform within the maximum trial duration (60 seconds (s)) was placed directly
onto the platform. In all cases, once an animal reached or was placed on the platform, the
animal was allowed to remain there for 30 s and was then placed back into a pre-warmed
holding cage allowing the fur to dry between blocks. Each mouse was trained for 8 trials per
                                                38

 WO 2014/193632                                                               PCT/US2014/037563
day. Testing was conducted in blocks of approximately 8 mice, such that every mouse
performed one trial before returning to the first mouse for the second trial. Thus, inter-trial
intervals were maintained at approximately 15 minutes. Mice were tested for 6 days per
week, for a maximum of 2 weeks (total 12 sessions). Acquisition of the task was defined as
75% correct for two consecutive days. After acquisition, individual mice were progressed on
to reversal testing: all mice that acquired the task underwent 6 days of reversal testing,
regardless of performance. Mice were monitored at all times when in the pool. If an animal
struggled to stay above the water in the first trial, the experiment was terminated for that
mouse.
[00169]     Body Weight: FIGs. 13A and 13B show body weight differentiation between
treated and control groups. Body weight differentiation only became evident between 10-12
weeks, particularly in male mice, which typically progressed more rapidly than females, by
roughly 2 weeks. No differences in body weight of R6/2 transgenic mice were observed
between rAAV-treated groups. In FIGs. 13A and 13B, the mean body weights are shown (
S.E.M.) of R6/2_WT and R6/2_Tg mice following treatment with rAAV6-GFP, rAAV6
Happ It, rAAV6-INTT41, or VEH (vehicle) from 4-12 weeks of age (open circle: vehicle in
R6/2 WT controls; black square: rAAV-GFP in R6/2 Tg; gray square: rAAV-Happ It in R6/2
Tg; open square: rAAV-INT41 in R6/2 Tg).
[00170]      Open Fields Tests: Open Field tests measured movement of animals placed in the
center of the testing field and the total distance traveled and velocity of movement. GFP
controls, in female mice only, exhibited unusually high and unexpected total distance
traveled. R6/2 transgenic mice treated with INT41 showed significantly greater distance
traveled from the center relative to Happit. Mice treated with Happit were significantly
lower than GFP mice as measured by distance traveled, particularly relative to wild-type
vehicle controls in female mice.
[00171]     FIG. 14 shows the results of the Open Field test measured by the mean (±S.E.M.)
total distance traveled in the open field by R6/2_Tg and WT mice at 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks of
age. Data was obtained at 4 wks of age and served as baseline data for distribution of mice
into treatment groups. The data obtained at 6, 8 and 12 weeks of age following treatment
with rAAV6-GFP, rAAV6-Happlt, rAAV6-INT41, or vehicle (VEH) at 5 weeks of age
represented 1, 3 and 7 weeks post-infusion time points. FIG. 14 shows data presented across
the five minute time intervals, as well as for the sum of the entire 30 minute session. Data are

[00172]       FIG. 15 shows the data for an open field distance traveled from center test. The
data is represented by the mean (±S.E.M.) distance traveled in the center of the open field by
R6/2_Tg and WT mice at 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks of age. Data obtained at 4 wks of age served
as baseline data for distribution of mice into treatment groups. Data obtained at 6, 8 and 12
weeks of age following treatment with rAAV6-GFP, rAAV6-Happlt, rAAV6-INTT41, or
vehicle at 5 weeks of age represented 1, 3 and 7 weeks post-infusion time points. Data were
presented across the five minute time intervals, as well as for the sum of the entire 30 minute
session. FIG. 15 shows data for females (A) and males (B) separately. The asterisk (*)
indicates that INT4 1-treated mice showed significantly different distances traveled from GFP
(p<0.05). The # indicates that HappIt approached a significant difference from GFP
(p=0.0623).
[00173]       Grip Strength Test: Grip strength was tested and recorded with a strain gauge.
The average of five recorded values was reported. INT41-treated R6/2 transgenic mice
demonstrated significant improvement in hind limb grip strength as compared to hind limb
grip strength of GFP controls in the same mouse strain. No effect on forelimb strength was
observed.
[00174]       FIG. 16 shows non-normalized hind limb grip strength in mice treated with
intrabodies INT41, Happ It, GFP or vehicle (control). The effects ofrAAV6-INT41, rAAV6
Happ It or rAAV6-GFP on the hindlimb grip strength of R6/2_Tg mice are shown as
compared to VEH-treated R6/2_WT mice. Data are presented for females (FIG. 16A) and
                                              40

 WO 2014/193632                                                               PCT/US2014/037563
males (FIG. 16B) separately. 4 weeks was the baseline for all treated mice. INT41 showed a
significant difference in hind limb grip strength as compared to GFP-control mice at 12
weeks (p<0.05). HappIt approached significant difference from GFP-control (p=0.0623).
[00175]      Clasping Response: The clasping response was tested in R6/2 transgenic mice
treated with INT41 or HappI or controls. The clasping response was only seen in the R6/2
transgenic mice who grabbed themselves when picked up by the tail, rather than reaching out
to grab something in their environment. INT41 treated R6/2 transgenic mice demonstrated
significant delays in acquiring this modified behavior, similar to Happ 1 treated mice.
[00176]      In FIGs. 17-18, the clasping responses of INT41-treated mice, Happit-treated
mice, GFP-treated mice or control vehicle treated mice are shown (FIG. 17 shows results for
female mice; FIG. 18 shows results for male mice). The proportion of mice each week
presenting with a full limb clasp is depicted, as evaluated from 7-12 weeks of age following
bilateral striatal infusion of rAAV6-INT41, rAAV6-Happ it, rAAV6-GFP or VEH at 5 weeks
of age. Clasping was assessed at 4, 5 and 6 weeks of age, but since no mice displayed a
clasping phenotype, the ages were not included in the figures above.
[00177]      Chi square analysis of full clasping behavior observed in R6/2_Tg mice treated
with rAAV6-Happ It as compared to rAAV6-GFP treated R6/2_Tg mice showed the
following:
[00178]      In the gender combined data, a smaller proportion of R6/2_Tg mice treated with
Happit displayed full clasping behavior at 11 wks of age (p=0.0341).
[00179]      In R6/2_Tg females only: At 10 wks, there was a trend for a higher proportion of
HappIt treated R6/2_Tg females to display full clasping behavior as compared to female
GFP-treated counterparts (p=0.0578). At 12 weeks of age a significantly higher proportion
of Happlt-treated R6/2 Tg females did display more full clasps than did the GFP-treated
R6/2_Tg females (p=0.03 84).
[00180]      In the R6/2_Tg males only: At 10 wks, there was a trend for a smaller proportion
of Happit treated R6/2_Tg males to display full clasping behavior as compared to male GFP
treated counterparts (p=0.0 6 3 7 ). At II weeks of age, a significantly lower proportion of
Happ it-treated R6/2_Tg males did display more full clasps than did the GFP-treated
R6/2_Tg males (p=0.0016).

revealed a trend at 11 wks of age for INT41-treated R6/2_Tg mice (gender combined) to
display a lower proportion of full clasps (p=0.0768). No gender-specific effects were noted.
[00182]      T-Maze cognitive test: The T-Maze cognitive test measures the ability to learn
where a platform is located while swimming in a T configured tank with a platform on one
side of the T. Learning is shown by the ability to learn the location of the platform on two
consecutive days. The group is determined to have achieved learning when 75% acquire the
task.
[00183]      In this test, the INT41 treated female R6/2 transgenic achieved learning of the task
in the same time as the nontransgenic control mice. Male mice (who progress in disease at a
faster rate) treated with INT41were better in learning than the GFP or HappI mice, but not
the nontransgenic control.
[00184]      FIG. 19 shows the results for the T-Maze cognitive test, measuring the proportion
of mice achieving Task Acquisition in male and female mice (at 9-10 weeks). FIG. 19A
shows results for male mice; FIG. 19B shows results for female mice. The acquisition of the
procedural T-maze task was measured in the average number of days to acquire the task.
Data was expressed as mean ±SEM. Asterisks (*p<0.05, **p<0.01) indicate significant
difference compared to R62-WT vehicle. T-Maze results demonstrated that INT41 and
HappI treated female mice, as a group, performed as well as controls. In male mice, INT41
treated mice performed better than both GFP and Happ It mice, but the differences were not
statistically significant.

        Example 9: Immunohistochemical Enumeration of Aggregates in R6/2 Brain
        Sections
[00186]     In one example, the immunohistochemical enumeration of aggregates in R6/2
brain sections from mice was studied. The enumeration of aggregates from
immunohistochemical staining of brain sections was determined by bilateral enumeration at
two cross-section levels per animal (and performed identically across all animals) with a 40x
objective. Both striata were imaged at two different coronal levels- 4 images per animal and
analyzed as described by Simmons, et al. [16].

[00187]     The fields examined included between 1,000 and 2,000 aggregates per animal in
approximately the same plane of the striatum. The results demonstrated the INT41 groups
had fewer aggregates overall. When aggregates were examined by frequency analysis
(GraphPad Prism 6.0), the INT41 group had fewer aggregates in the smaller size range
consistent with inhibiting the initial aggregation of HttpQ. The frequency of 0.01-0.1 Pm
aggregate numbers in INT41 mice were 22% (p<O.13) lower than GFP and 34% (p<0.0 5 )
lower than Happ It mice. The frequency of 0.1-1 pm aggregates in INT41 mice were 16%
(p<0.09) lower than GFP and 18% (p<O. 10) lower than Happ It mice.
[00188]     Disease modification in Huntington's Disease requires that a therapeutic agent
block or prevent the continuing cascade of events that is initiated by aggregation of HttpQ
and results in neuron death. INT41 has the properties consistent with disease modification in
both cell-based systems where it blocked HttpQ103-GFP aggregation and gene dysregulation
and in animal models where it improved motor and cognitive function. Animal models for
Huntington's disease fail to capitulate human clinical results, but the mechanistic features of
HttpQ aggregation have been well studied and linked closely with human disease. Pools of
soluble aggregates decline with age as insoluble aggregates accumulate [17, 18], and this
dynamic may be altered by INT41 based on the inhibition of the formation of small
aggregates in the brains of INT41 treated R6/2 mice (Table 6).
[00189]     The R6/2 studies demonstrated improvements in several tests of motor and
cognitive function, primarily in female mice where disease progression is not as rapid. These
studies, both in vitro and in vivo, suggest that INT41 can slow or prevent early aggregation of
HttpQ supporting early intervention as a therapeutic imperative. Although Happit performed
similarly to INT41, several animals in the Happ It group died earlier (data not shown), but
this observation could not be confirmed without a formal survival study.
[00190]     The solubility differences between INT41 and Happ It in E. coli and mammalian
expression systems suggest that Happ It has folding problems that could be due to the
absence of a heavy chain, leaving light chain domains that normally interact with heavy chain
domains to seek out self-self association or association with other proteins that could result in
aggregation.
[00191]     Comparison of the data with historical control R6/2 transgenic mice indicate that
GFP unexpectedly had some disease modifying effect in some of the tests, specifically open
field. A review of historical controls and published GFP baseline data suggests that GFP
mice may have declines less rapidly than expected, particularly as seen in FIG. 9. The effect

of GFP may be attributable to the increase in genes regulating protein degradation
particularly several ubiquitin related genes that modify proteins for degradation [19].
However, the effect of GFP is short-lived and only direct comparison with a TG control
would be required to confirm any differences.
