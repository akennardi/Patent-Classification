ABSTRACT
A skew adjustment method and apparatus for adjusting the skewed condition of a movable rail
(12) of a window covering (10) in which the movable rail (12) is supported by lift cords wrapped
around spools (28). A drive train disconnecting mechanism is used to disconnect a first spool
from a second spool, the first spool is rotated relative to the second spool, thereby changing the
length of the first lift cord relative to the second lift cord until the movable rail (12) is in the
desired position; and then the first and second spools (28) are reconnected so the first and
second spools (28) rotate together. An end cap (102) may be used to enable multiple
disassemblies and reassemblies of the end cap (102) to access the skew adjustment
mechanism (112). In one embodiment, there are two movable rails, and the lift cords (200, 202)
for both movable rails extend through the same rout holes in the covering (204). Disconnecting
the first spool from the second spool may activate a mechanism that prevents the second spool
from rotating.

                    Skew Adjustment Mechanism for a Window Covering
BACKGROUND
[0001]     The present invention relates to a skew adjustment mechanism for a window
covering. More specifically, it relates to a skew adjustment mechanism to level the movable rail
of a shade or blind.
[0002]     Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
considered as an admission that such prior art iswidely known or forms part of common general
knowledge in the field.
[0003]      In typical prior art arrangements, in order to straighten out a movable rail of a window
covering such as a shade or blind that is crooked (skewed) after installation, the operator may
have to disengage at least one of the lift cords from the skewed rail (typically a bottom rail or a
movable, intermediate rail), adjust the length of the lift cord and reattach the lift cord to the rail.
This is generally not something the end user is capable of doing, and it may even present a
challenge to a seasoned installer.
SUMMARY
[0004]      In one embodiment of the present invention, first and second rotatable spools are
interconnected by a drive train on one rail of the shade or blind, and a disconnect mechanism is
provided which allows the user to apply an outside force to disconnect the drive train between
the first and second rotatable spools and to rotate one of the spools relative to the other in order
to increase or decrease the effective length of one of the lift cords relative to the other to correct
the skewed condition. When the outside force is released, the disconnect mechanism
automatically reconnects the first and second rotatable spools so they again rotate together for
normal operation.
[0005]      In another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method for
adjusting the effective length of one lift cord relative to another in a covering for an architectural
opening having first and second lift cords wound onto first and second lift spools, respectively,
                                                    1

wherein the first and second lift cords support a first movable rail that is connected to the
covering, and wherein the first and second lift spools are interconnected so as to rotate
together, comprising the steps of: temporarily disconnecting the first lift spool from the second
lift spool; then rotating the first lift spool relative to the second lift spool to change the effective
length of the first lift cord relative to the second lift cord; and then reconnecting the first and
second lift spools so the first and second lift spools rotate together again.
[0006]       In another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a skew adjustment
mechanism for adjusting a skewed movable rail in a window covering, comprising: a movable
rail having first and second ends, said movable rail being connected to an expandable covering;
a second rail substantially parallel to said movable rail; first and second lift cords supporting said
movable rail; first and second rotatable spools, each having an axis of rotation, wherein both of
said first and second rotatable spools are located on the same one of said movable and second
rails; wherein said first and second lift cords are connected to said first and second rotatable
spools, respectively, and wrap onto and off of the respective rotatable spools as said respective
rotatable spools rotate so as to increase and decrease the effective length of said first and
second lift cords and to extend and retract the covering; a drive train also located on said one
rail and interconnecting said first and second rotatable spools so said first and second rotatable
spools rotate together during normal operation; and a biased disconnector in said drive train,
biased in a first direction, said biased disconnector being responsive to an outside force acting
opposite the first direction to temporarily disconnect said first rotatable spool from said second
rotatable spool to enable the rotation of one of said first and second rotatable spools relative to
the other of said first and second rotatable spools in order to enable changing the effective
length of said first lift cord relative to said second lift cord and which re-connects said first and
second rotatable spools for normal operation when the outside force is released.
[0007]       In another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a covering for an
architectural opening, comprising: a movable rail having first and second ends, said movable rail
being connected to an expandable covering; first and second lift cords supporting said movable
rail; first and second rotatable spools mounted on said movable rail and operatively connected
to said first and second lift cords such that winding up said lift cords on said spools and
unwinding said lift cords from said spools extends and retracts the expandable covering; a
mounting member secured to said movable rail at said first end, and an end cap mounted onto
said mounting member at said first end so as to cover the mounting member, wherein said end
                                                        2

cap has a normally concave shape, and further comprising a centrally located ramp member on
one of said mounting member and said end cap and a mating centrally located hook on the
other of said mounting member and said end cap, wherein, when said ramp member and hook
are brought together, the hook travels along the ramp and snaps onto the ramp, flattening the
normally concave shape of the end cap and creating a spring tension force that retains the end
cap on the mounting member.
[0008]       In another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a covering for an
architectural opening, comprising: a first movable rail having first and second ends, said first
movable rail being connected to an expandable covering; first and second lift cords supporting
said first movable rail; first and second rotatable spools mounted on said first movable rail and
operatively connected to said first and second lift cords such that winding up said first and
second lift cords on said first and second spools and unwinding said first and second lift cords
from said first and second spools raises and lowers the first movable rail and extends and
retracts the expandable covering; a second movable rail parallel to and below said first movable
rail; third and fourth lift cords supporting said second movable rail; a first set of vertically
spaced-apart, aligned rout openings in said expandable covering, wherein said first and third lift
cords extend vertically, in close side-by-side relationship to each other, through said first set of
vertically spaced-apart, aligned rout openings; and a second set of vertically spaced-apart,
aligned rout openings in said expandable covering, wherein said second and fourth lift cords
extend vertically, in close side-by side relationship to each other, through said second set of
vertically spaced-apart, aligned rout openings.

DESCRIPTION
[0082]     Figure 1 shows a shade 10 with a bottom rail 12 in a skewed orientation (in phantom)
and the same bottom rail 12 (in solid lines) after it has been brought back to a horizontal
orientation using a lift station 14 with a skew adjustment mechanism.
[0083]     Referring to Figures 2 and 4, the bottom rail 12 is supported by lift cords (not shown)
that are secured at a top rail (or head rail) 13 and extend downwardly through holes in the
pleated shade material 15, to the left and right lift stations 16, 14 housed in the bottom rail 12.
(Cords are shown in Figures 31 and 32.) The lift stations 16, 14 include lift spools 28, which are
functionally connected to each other through a drive train that includes a lift rod 18, which has a
longitudinal axis and is mounted in the bottom rail 12 for rotation about the longitudinal axis. A
lock mechanism 20 is provided to lock the lift rod 18 and prevent the lift rod 18 from rotating until
a button or lever 21 is pushed. One type of lock mechanism that may be used is described in
detail in US Publication 2012-0227912, published September 13, 2012, corresponding to US
                                                   9

Patent Application S/N 13/404,874, "Control for Movable Rail", which is hereby incorporated
herein by reference. (See, for instance, the lock mechanism 12 in Figures 1-5 of the referenced
application.)
[0084]       In this embodiment, the lock mechanism 20 is normally engaged (locked), and
prevents the lift rod from rotating in either direction, unless the lock mechanism is released by
the user. A spring motor 76, which is connected to the lift rod 18, assists the user in winding the
lift cords (not shown) onto their respective lift spools 28 in the lift stations 14, 16 (See Figures 3
and 6) when raising the shade 10.
[0085]       Figures 3 -7 show the rightmost lift station 14 of Figure 2 with a skew adjustment. The
lift station 14 includes a lift portion 42 (See Figure 6) and a skew adjustment mechanism portion
44 as described in more detail later. The leftmost lift station 16 (See Figures 2 and 8) is a mirror
image of the lift portion 42 of the rightmost lift station 14, except that it does not include the
skew adjustment shaft 24. Instead, in the leftmost lift station 16, the lift rod 18 engages the
spool 28 directly. The lift rod 18 may, in fact, extend completely through the leftmost lift station
16.
[0086]       On the rightmost lift station 14, the skew adjustment mechanism portion 44 snaps
onto the lift portion 42.
[0087]      The rightmost lift station 14 with skew adjustment (See Figure 4) includes an end cap
22, a skew adjustment shaft 24, a lift-cord-routing cap 26, a lift spool 28, a lift spool housing 30,
a plunger housing cap 32, a plunger 34, a compression spring 36, a lift rod adapter 38, and a
coupler 40.
[0088]       Referring to Figures 4, 5, and especially to Figure 6, the spool 28 is mounted for
clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation within the assembly formed by snapping together the
spool housing 30 and the lift-cord-routing cap 26. The right end of the lift portion 42 is
supported by a cylindrical projection 46 on the lift-cord-routing cap 26, which is received in a
cylindrical recess 48 on the end cap 22. The left end of the lift portion 42 is supported indirectly
by the lift rod 18, via the skew adjustment shaft 24, the lift rod adapter 38 and the coupler 40.
                                                     10

[0089]       The leftmost lift station 16, which does not include the skew adjustment mechanism
44, is supported at the left end by its respective end cap 22 and at the right end directly by the
lift rod 18.
[0090]       The lift-cord-routing cap 26 defines an "ear" 50 (See Figure 4), which is secured to a
projection 52 on the end cap 22 to prevent rotation and axial movement of the spool housing 30
and lift-cord-routing cap 26 assembly. In this embodiment, the ear 50 is secured by a screw 51.
[0091]       The lift-cord-routing cap 26 also defines an inlet port 54 to guide the lift cord into the
spool housing 30 and onto the spool 28. An enlargement on one end of the lift cord can be
inserted behind a slotted opening 56 in the spool 28 to releasably secure the lift cord to the
spool 28.
[0092]       Referring back to Figures 4 and 5, the plunger housing cap 32 is a flat, disk-shaped
element defining a plurality of teeth 58 on its first face. These teeth 58 mesh with a set of
corresponding teeth 60 on the face of the plunger 34 such that, when the compression spring 36
biases the plunger 34 in a first axial direction, toward the plunger housing cap 32, the teeth 60
on the plunger 34 fit into the grooves between the teeth 58 on the plunger housing cap 32, and
the teeth 58 on the plunger housing cap 32 fit into the grooves between the teeth 60 on the
plunger, forcing both the plunger housing cap 32 and the plunger 34 to rotate together as a
single piece.
[0093]       The plunger housing cap 32 also defines two radially-projecting tabs 62 which are
received in corresponding slots 64 on the lift rod adapter 38 such that the plunger housing cap
32 and the lift rod adapter 38 are keyed together, so they are always engaged and rotate
together. The lift rod adapter 38 has an inner bore 74 (See Figure 4), which defines a non
circular cross-sectional profile that matches the profile of the lift rod 18. The lift rod 18 is
received in that inner bore 74, thereby keying the lift rod adapter 38 and the lift rod 18 together.
[0094]       The coupler 40 is mounted onto the spool housing 30, provides rotational support for
the lift rod adapter 38 and serves to secure the skew adjustment mechanism portion 44 to the
lift portion 42.
                                                    11

[0095]      As best shown in Figure 5, both the inner bore 66 of the spool 28 and the inner bore
68 of the plunger 34 define a non-circular cross-sectional profile, which closely matches the
non-circular cross-sectional profile of the skew adjustment shaft 24 (which is also identical to the
non-circular cross-sectional profile of the lift rod 18).
[0096]      As shown in Figure 6, the skew adjustment shaft 24 extends through the inner bore 66
of the spool 28, through the inner bore 68 of the plunger 34, and through the inner bore 65 of
the plunger housing cap 32. Due to matching non-circular cross-sectional profiles, the skew
adjustment shaft 24, the spool 28, and the plunger 34 are all keyed together for rotation in
unison. The inner bore 65 of the plunger housing cap 32 has a circular profile, which allows
relative rotation between the skew adjustment shaft 24 and the plunger housing cap 32.
[0097]      The head 71 of the skew adjustment shaft 24 defines a slotted recess 70 which may
be accessed by the user via a conventional flat screwdriver extending through the opening 72 in
the end cap 22. Of course, the slotted recess 70 could be shaped differently so as to be
engaged by a different shape of driver, such as an Allen wrench, for example.
[0098]       Referring now to Figure 6, as the shade 10 is lowered (while the user is depressing
the lever 21 to unlock the lock 20 and is pulling down on the bottom rail 12), the spools 28 (See
Figure 5) rotate in a clockwise direction as the lift cord (not shown) unwinds from the spools 28.
The rotation of the spool 28 on the rightmost lift station 14 with skew adjustment mechanism 44
causes the skew adjustment shaft 24 to rotate, which causes the plunger 34 to rotate as well.
Since the compression spring 36 biases the plunger 34 against the plunger housing cap 32, the
teeth 60 on the plunger 34 engage the teeth 58 on the plunger housing cap 32 such that both
the plunger 34 and the plunger housing cap 32 rotate in unison. Finally, since the plunger
housing cap 32 is keyed to the lift rod adapter 38 via the tabs 62 which engage the slots 64, and
the lift rod adapter 38 is keyed to the lift rod 18, as the shade is lowered the entire drive train
connecting the two lift spools 28 (i.e. the skew adjustment shaft 24, both the left and right spools
28, the plunger housing cap 32, the plunger 34, the lift rod adapter 38, and the lift rod 18 also
rotate in unison. The spring (not shown) on the spring motor 76 winds up as the shade is
lowered, increasing the potential energy of the spring motor 76 in preparation to assist in the
raising of the shade, as described later.
                                                    12

[0099]      To raise the shade 10, the user grasps the lock mechanism 20 and presses the button
21 to disengage the lock, then lifts up on the bottom rail 12. The spring motor 76 rotates the lift
rod 18 in a counter-clockwise direction, which rotates the entire drive train described above so
as to wind any slack lift cord onto the left and right spools 28 of the left and right lift stations 16,
14, respectively.
[0100]       Referring now to Figure 7, to adjust a skewed rail condition, the user inserts the end of
a flat screwdriver into the slotted recess 70 of the skew adjustment shaft 24 to both push it
inwardly (in the direction of the arrow 78 and against the biasing force of the spring 36) and to
rotate it (in a clockwise direction to lower this end of the shade or in a counter-clockwise
direction to raise this end of the shade).
[0101]      As the user pushes the skew adjustment shaft 24 in the direction of the arrow 78, he
moves the plunger 34 axially to the left against the biasing spring 36, compressing the biasing
spring 36 and creating a gap 81 between the teeth 58 of the plunger housing cap 32 and the
teeth 60 of the plunger 34 so they are no longer engaged, thereby disconnecting the drive train
between the lift spools 28 of the leftmost 16 and rightmost 14 lift mechanisms. Since the
plunger 34 and the plunger housing cap 32 are no longer engaged, the plunger 34 is free to
rotate without driving the plunger housing cap 32 (or any other part of the drive downstream of
the plunger housing cap 32, such as the lift rod adapter 38 and the lift rod 18). The user can
then rotate the skew adjustment shaft 24, which also rotates the spool 28 to which it is keyed,
either winding up the lift cord onto the spool 28 or unwinding the lift cord from the spool 28 to
adjust the effective length of one lift cord relative to the other until the skewed condition of the
rail has been corrected.
[0102]      As soon as the user releases the skew adjustment shaft 24, the compression spring
36 pushes the plunger 34 back against the plunger housing cap 32 such that their
corresponding teeth 60, 58 engage each other to automatically reconnect the drive train
between the left and right spools 28 so the left and right spools 28 again rotate together.
[0103]      To summarize, the axial displacement of the plunger 34 engages and disengages the
plunger 34 from the plunger housing cap 32 which is keyed to the lift rod adapter 38 and to the
lift rod 18, thereby connecting and disconnecting the drive train between the left and right lift
spools 28.
                                                    13

[0104]       If the right side of the movable rail 12 is too high relative to the left side, the user
pushes in on the skew adjustment shaft 24 to disengage the teeth 58, 60. The user then rotates
the skew adjustment shaft 24 in the direction to unwind the rightmost lift cord from the rightmost
spool 28, thereby lowering the right end of the movable rail 12 relative to the left end until the
movable rail 12 is horizontal or has the desired amount of skew.
[0105]       It should be noted that, in this particular mechanism, it is not strictly necessary to push
in on the skew adjustment shaft 24 in order to correct a skewed rail condition, because the
mechanism includes a sort of one-way brake or one-way drive, in that the teeth 58, 60 are
tapered to permit the teeth 60 of the plunger 34 to slip past the teeth 58 of the plunger housing
cap 32 in one direction but not in the other, forming a ratchet type of mechanism, which allows
the user to rotate the lift spool 28 in the rightmost lift station 14 to roll up the lift cord without
pushing in on the skew adjustment shaft 24. So, if the right side of the movable rail 12 is too
low, the skew adjustment shaft 24 need only be rotated in a direction to wind the right lift cord
onto the lift spool 28 of the rightmost lift station 14. The teeth, 58, 60 act as a ratcheting
mechanism, making a distinct audible "click" as the skew adjustment shaft 24 ratchets to wind
the lift cord onto the rightmost spool 28, shortening the effective length of the rightmost lift cord
and raising the right end of the movable rail 12 relative to the left end. Note that the plunger 34
is still displaced axially a short distance during each of these discreet minute ratcheting
adjustments, just far enough for the teeth 60 of the plunger 34 to skip past the teeth 58 of the
plunger housing cap 32.
[0106]       While the embodiment described above has the lift stations 14, 16 and lift spools 28
and the skew adjustment mechanism located on the movable rail, they alternatively could be
located in the head rail 13, with the lift cords extending down from the lift spools 28 in the head
rail 13, through the covering material 15, and secured at the bottom rail 12, as shown in Figure
9. In that case, if the movable rail 12 becomes skewed, the adjustments described with respect
to the first embodiment would instead be made in the head rail to bring the bottom rail 12 back
into horizontal alignment.
[0107]       Also, the window covering could include a head rail which supports an intermediate
movable rail and a bottom movable rail. In that case, the skew adjustment for the bottom
movable rail could be located in the intermediate movable rail from which the bottom rail is
suspended, or the skew adjustment mechanism could be located in the bottom movable rail.
                                                     14

[0108]     In this first embodiment, the connecting member which connects the spools together
through the drive train is the plunger 34, and the mechanism for engaging and disengaging the
plunger 34 with the drive train is ratchet teeth and a biasing spring. Of course, other
engaging/disengaging mechanisms could be used and other mechanisms for maintaining the
engagement when no outside force is applied could be used as an alternative to the
arrangement described with respect to the first embodiment.
Alternate Embodiment using spring brake and including combination of end cap and end
lock
[0109]     Figures 10-30 disclose an alternative cellular shade 100.
[0110]     It should be noted that, in order to adjust the skew angle of the bottom rail 12 in the
first embodiment of Figure 1 using the skew adjustment mechanism 44 (shown in Figure 6),
there is a small opening in the end cap 22 (See Figure 2) in order to access the skew
adjustment shaft 24. This may be aesthetically undesirable. The alternative is to eliminate the
small opening and just remove the end cap 22 in order to gain access to the skew adjustment
shaft 24. In prior art rails, the end cap has an interference fit with the rail, utilizing crush ribs on
the end cap to secure the end cap to the end of the rail. Unfortunately, after disassembling the
end cap only a very few times, the crush ribs are worn to the point that they no longer secure
the end cap to the end of the rail. This makes it impractical to repeatedly remove and reattach
the end cap.
[0111]     The end cap 102 and end lock 118 of this embodiment (See Figure 11) as described
below, solve that issue, allowing multiple assembly/disassembly procedures of the end cap 102
with no loss in gripping power between the end cap 102 and the rail 106.
[0112]     Referring to Figure 11, the cellular shade 100 includes a top rail 104 and a movable
rail 106 including a handle 108 for raising (retracting) and lowering (extending) the cellular
shade covering 110. Referring to Figures 12 and 13, the movable rail 106 houses a skew
adjustment mechanism 112 (as shown in Figure 10) and a lift station 114 (similar to the lift
station 42 of Figure 6). The skew adjustment mechanism 112 snaps onto the lift station 114,
which significantly increases the mechanical integrity of the assembly and reduces the
mechanical backlash between the components 112, 114.
                                                  15

[0113]     Referring to Figure 13, the components in this embodiment which are different from
those shown in Figure 2 include the skew adjustment shaft 116, an end lock 118, a skew
adjustment tool 120, and the end cap 102, all described in more detail below. Also, the skew
adjustment mechanism 112, shown in Figure 10, differs from the skew adjustment mechanism
44, shown in Figure 6, as described in more detail below.
[0114]     Very briefly, the end lock 118 (See also Figures 29 and 30) is attached to the rail 106
via a screw 122 which is directed by the walls of the cylindrical opening 124 in a direction so it
cuts its own threads in the metal rail 106 as the screw 122 is threaded between the semi
cylindrical opening 124 and the longitudinal ridge 126 of the rail 106. The end cap 102 snaps
onto the end lock 118, as described in more detail later. The skew adjustment tool 120 is
stowed in the end lock 118 when not in use. When the skew adjustment tool 120 is in use, its
head 130 (See Figure 19) matches up with the corresponding head 128 (See Figure 20) of the
skew adjustment shaft 116, as described in more detail later.
[0115]     The skew adjustment shaft 116 engages the spool 28 in the lift station 114 and
engages the plunger 34A of the skew adjustment mechanism 112.
[0116]     Referring now to Figures 19 and 20, the skew adjustment tool 120 is an "L"-shaped
element with a head 130 which drives the matching head 128 on the skew adjustment shaft 116
in one direction only (which is the direction in which the plunger 34, see Figure 4, and the spool
28 need to rotate to shorten the lift cord in order to correct any skew of the rail 12). The head
130 of this one-way tool 120 may be described by considering it in quadrants (See also Figure
17). Two of the opposing quadrants 132, 134 are made up of a flat, planar wall which is
perpendicular to the longitudinal or axial direction of the skew adjustment tool 120). Each of the
other two opposing quadrants 136, 138 defines first and second surfaces 142, 144 extending in
the longitudinal or axial direction of the skew adjustment tool 120. The first, arcuate, convex
surface 142 terminates in a small flat, "truncated" point 140 that is parallel to the surfaces of the
first and second quadrants 132, 134. The second surface 144 defines a flat wall which is
perpendicular to the surfaces of the first and second quadrants 132, 134.
[0117]     As shown in Figure 20, the skew adjustment shaft 116 includes a head 128 which
mates up with the head 130 of the skew adjustment tool 120. The main difference between the
head 128 of the skew adjustment shaft and the head 130 of the skew adjustment tool is that the
                                                  16

surface 145 (See Figure 20) on the head 128 of the skew adjustment shaft 116 defines a
concave, arcuate surface 145 which matches and receives the convex profile of the surface 142
of the skew adjustment tool 120, and the flat surfaces 132', 134' on the head 128 which are
perpendicular to the axis of the shaft 116 are at the very tip or end of the head 128, lying at the
end of a projection having a flat wall 144' and an arcuate wall 145 instead of being recessed up
into the head as are the flat surfaces 132, 134 on the tool 120. In other words, the head 128 of
the shaft 116 is complementary in shape to the head 130 of the tool 120 so the two heads 128,
130 mate up completely with each other.
[0118]     The skew adjustment tool 120 can drive the skew adjustment shaft 116 only in the
direction of the arrow 146 (in the counterclockwise direction as seen from the vantage point of
Figure 20), when the flat walls 144 of the head 130 of the tool 120 abut against and drive the flat
walls 144' of the head 128 of the shaft 116. When attempting to drive the skew adjustment
shaft 116 in the clockwise direction, the convex, arcuate surfaces 142 of the skew adjustment
tool 120 will slide up along the concave arcuate surfaces 144 of the skew adjustment shaft 116,
and will be unable to drive the skew adjustment shaft 116 in that direction.
[0119]     In a preferred embodiment, the skew adjustment tool 120 is made from a softer
material than the skew adjustment shaft 116 (out of a non-aggressive plastic, for instance)
which will provide ample useful life for the skew adjustment tool 120 without any damage to the
skew adjustment shaft 116.
[0120]     When the skew adjustment tool 120 is not in use, the leg 150 of the skew adjustment
tool 120 is stowed in a hollow cylindrical cavity 148 in the end lock 118 (See Figures 23 and 24).
In this embodiment, the leg 150 is stamped or inscribed with simple instructions for its use.
[0121]     Figure 10 shows the skew adjustment mechanism 112, which has a different type of
disengaging mechanism than in the previous embodiment. In this skew adjustment mechanism
112, the disengaging mechanism includes a one-way drive or one-way brake that uses a wrap
spring 80 to provide the braking force instead of using interlocking teeth and a ratchet
mechanism as shown in the first embodiment.
[0122]     In this embodiment, the plunger housing cap 32A has tabs 62A, which engage
recesses 64A in the lift rod adapter 38A, so the plunger housing cap 32A rotates with the lift rod
                                                  17

adapter 38A and serves as a cover to enclose the internal parts. It does not have teeth as in
the cap 32 of the previous embodiment. The biasing spring 36 biases the plunger 34A into
engagement with the right end tab 83 of the wrap spring 80, with the right end tab 83 of the
wrap spring 80 fitting into one of the radially-extending slots 60A in the plunger 34.
[0123]      Under normal operating conditions, the outer surface of the wrap spring 80 engages
the inner surface 82 of the lift rod adapter 38A, creating enough friction between the spring 80
and the inner surface 82 to cause the plunger 34A to rotate with the lift rod adapter 38A, which
causes the left and right lift spools 28 in the left and right lift stations 16, 114 to rotate together
as the user raises and lowers the covering 110 by raising and lowering the handle 108.
[0124]      When the right end tab 83 of the wrap spring 80 is engaged with the plunger 34A, and
the user uses the tool 120 to rotate the skew adjustment shaft 116 in a direction to wrap up the
lift cord onto the lift spool 28 (counterclockwise when viewed from the right end in this
embodiment), the rotation of the skew adjustment shaft 116, which is keyed to the plunger 34A
and to the lift spool 28 of the lift station 114, causes rotation of the lift spool 28 of the lift station
114. It also causes rotation of the plunger 34A, which pushes the tab 83 of the wrap spring 80
in the counterclockwise direction, causing the outside diameter of the wrap spring 80 to be
reduced, so the outer surface of the wrap spring 80 slips relative to the inner surface 82 of the
lift rod adapter 38A, thereby disengaging the drive train between the left and right spools 28,
which allows the user to rotate the plunger 34A and wrap up the cord onto the right most lift
spool 28 to shorten the effective length of the rightmost lift cord relative to the leftmost lift cord,
thereby raising the right end of the movable rail 106 relative to the left end.
[0125]      If the user wants to unwind the lift cord from the rightmost lift spool 28 without also
unwinding the lift cord from the leftmost lift spool 28, he uses the tool 120 to push in on the skew
adjustment shaft 116, which pushes the plunger 34A axially against the biasing spring 36, which
disengages the wrap spring 80 from the plunger 34A. This disengages the drive train between
the left and right lift spools 28. Once the drive train between the left and right lift spools 28 is
disengaged, the user can pull the right end of the rail 106 downwardly to rotate the rightmost lift
spool 28 relative to the leftmost lift spool 28 in order to unwind the rightmost lift cord from its
spool 28 to increase the effective length of the rightmost lift cord relative to the leftmost lift cord.
                                                    18

[0126]     Once the movable rail 106 has reached a horizontal, non-skewed position, or a
position with the desired amount of skew, the user can remove the tool 120 that was depressing
the skew adjustment shaft 116. At that point, the biasing spring 36 pushes the plunger 34A
back to the right, re-engaging the plunger 34A with the end tab 83 on the wrap spring 80 and re
connecting the drive train between the two lift spools 28 so they again rotate together.
[0127]     Of course, other types of mechanisms for connecting and disconnecting the drive train
could be used as alternatives as well, and there may be more than two lift spools interconnected
by the drive train.
[0128]     It would be possible to provide a skew adjustment mechanism on each of the lift
stations, so the user could adjust the skew at either end of the rail, if desired.
[0129]     The foot 152 of the "L"-shaped skew adjustment tool 120 provides an extension which
may be used as a lever arm to rotate the tool 120. In this embodiment, the foot 152 is stamped
or inscribed with a notice to the user to draw his attention to the fact that this tool may be used
to adjust the skew adjustment mechanism 112. This notice is visible to the user when he
removes the end cap 102 to adjust the skew on the rail 106 (as may also be seen in Figures 29
and 30 which feature a slightly different version of the notice on the tool 120').
[0130]     Referring to Figures 23 and 24, the end lock 118 is a substantially rectangular
member defining first and second cylindrical cavities 148, 154 extending in the longitudinal
direction of the rail 106. As described earlier, the cavity 148 receives the skew adjustment tool
120 (as shown also in Figures 14 and 15) when the tool 120 is stowed. The second cavity 154
provides access by the skew adjustment tool 120 to the head of the skew adjustment shaft 116.
As shown in Figures 14 and 15, a finger 156 on the housing of the lift station 114 releasably
engages the outer face 119 of the end lock 118 such that the end lock 118, the lift station 114,
and the skew adjustment mechanism 112 all become one interlocked assembly.
[0131]     As shown in Figure 24, in order to mount the end cap 102 on the end lock 118, the
end lock 118 defines upper and lower horizontal flat surfaces 158, each having a ramped
surface 160 at its proximal end and a similarly ramped surface 162 at its distal end. These
upper and lower horizontal flat surfaces 158 are located approximately midway along the front
to-back length of the end lock 118. As shown in Figure 21, posts 164 projecting inwardly from
                                                  19

the inner surface 172 of the end cap 102 have hooked ends 170 which releasably engage (snap
onto) the inner ramps 162 on the end lock 118 to retain the end cap 102 on the end lock 118.
[0132]      Referring to Figures 21 and 22, the end cap 102 is a rectangular member having a
slight curvature. A flange 166 surrounds the perimeter of three of the four edges of the end cap
102. The "top" edge 168 of the end cap 102 is "open" (has no flange) to allow the covering
material 110 to extend to the very edge of the shade 100 without interfering with the end cap
102 (See Figure 11).
[0133]      Referring to Figures 21, 26, and 28, as the end cap 102 is pushed inwardly onto the
end lock 118, the hooked ends 170 of the posts 164 of the end cap 102 are flexed outwardly by
the ramped surfaces 160 on the end lock 118, slide along the flat surfaces 158, and then spring
back to their original shape, where they contact the ramps 162 on the end lock 118.
[0134]      Figures 25 and 26 show the relationship between the end cap 102 and the end lock
118 during assembly of these pieces, just before they are fully snapped together. It may be
appreciated that the end cap 102 displays a slight curvature (a concavity on its inner surface
172.)
[0135]      Figures 27 and 28 show the relationship between the end cap 102 and the end lock
118 once the assembly of these pieces is completed, after they are fully snapped together. It
may be appreciated that the end cap 102 no longer displays the slight curvature. As the fingers
170 on the posts 164 slide onto the distal ramped surfaces 162 of the end lock 118, the posts
164 snap back inwardly, pulling the end cap 102 snugly against the end lock 118, and the
concavity on the inner surface 172 of the end cap 102 disappears. The end cap 102 is held
tightly to the end lock 118, under tension provided by the spring action of the "straightened"
concave surface 172 of the end cap 102. To remove the end cap 102 from the end lock 118,
the user simply grasps the end cap 102 from the top and bottom edges near the location of the
posts 164 and pulls outwardly. The fingers 170 slide up along the distal ramped surfaces 162 of
the end lock 118, spreading the fingers 170 outwardly to release the end cap 102.
[0136]      It should be noted that the skew adjustment tool 120 may be tethered to the end lock
118 to ensure that it is not misplaced. For instance, a small opening (not shown) anywhere
along the leg 150 of the tool 120 may be used to tie a short length of cord (not shown) to the
                                                 20

tool 120. The other end of the cord may be routed through the cavity 148 of the end lock 118
and tied to the end lock 118 itself. The length of cord would be chosen to be long enough to
allow the tool 120 to be extracted from the end lock 118 and then used to push against (or
rotate) the skew adjustment shaft 116 while remaining tethered to the end lock 118.
Alternate embodiment of lift station
[0137]       Figures 31-37 shown an alternate embodiment of a window covering 208, with an
alternate embodiment of a lift station 114', which is similar to the lift station 114 of Figure 12 but
which allows two or more lift cords 200, 202 (See Figure 32) to simultaneously travel through
the same rout openings in the covering material 204 even though the lift cords 200, 202 each
ultimately are connected to different lift stations 114', 114.
[0138]       In the prior art, when there is an intermediate movable rail, each lift cord (the cord for
the intermediate rail and the cord for the lower rail) has its own rout openings in the covering
material, and the lift stations to which these different lift cords are attached are spaced apart
horizontally so that the lift stations do not interfere with the lift cords. This is not an issue when
the window covering is a cellular product (as shown in the bottom portion 212 of the shade of
Figure 31) as the cellular product hides the multiple lift cords extending vertically along the
covering 212. However, if a portion of the window covering is open to expose the lift cords
(such as the pleated shade portion 210 shown in the upper portion of Figure 31), then running
several lift cords which are spaced apart horizontally from each other results in an esthetically
unappealing window covering.
[0139]       The lift stations 114' in the intermediate rail 214 of Figure 32 circumvent this problem
by allowing two (or more) unrelated lift cords 200, 202 (See Figure 32, 33, and 36) to use the
same set of vertically spaced-apart, aligned rout openings 203 on the covering material 204
(See Figure 32), with a first lift cord 200 extending vertically from the head rail 216 and secured
to the lift station 114' and a second, bypass lift cord 202 extending vertically from the head rail
216, going through the lift station 114' in the intermediate rail 214, and continuing vertically
downwardly to a lift station 114 or 14 (not shown) in the lower rail 220 without affecting the
functionality of the lift station 114' and with no frictional penalty on the second lift cord 202, as
explained in more detail below. (The lift stations 114 and 14 are shown in previous
embodiments.)
                                                     21

[0140]       It should be noted that feeding the ends of the lift cords 200, 202 into the inlet nozzle
206 on the lift station 114' would be a daunting task, as there are two relatively small and
independent openings 232, 234 in very close proximity to each other. However, the lift station
114' includes a collection trough 240 at the distal end of the inlet nozzle 206 that helps collect
frayed ends on the lift cord and consolidates and lines up the end of the lift cord (200 or 202)
with one of the openings (232, 234 respectively) to facilitate the feeding of the end of the lift
cord, as explained in more detail later.
[0141]       Referring now to Figures 31 and 32, the window covering 208 includes an upper
pleated shade portion 210 and a lower cellular shade portion 212. The upper pleated shade
portion 210 is suspended from the top rail 216 via a first set of lift cords 200; each of the lift
cords 200 is secured to a spool 218 (shown in Figure 36) which is mounted for rotation in one of
the lift stations 114' located in the intermediate movable rail 214.
[0142]       The lower cellular shade portion 212 is suspended from the top rail 216 via a second
set of lift cords 202; each of the lift cords 202 being secured to a spool 28 (See Figure 6)
mounted for rotation in a lift station 114 or 14 located in a lower movable rail 220, similar to
Figure 2. It should be noted that the lift cords 202 are guided by and go through the lift stations
114' in the intermediate rail 214 without interacting with, or otherwise functionally affecting, the
lift stations 114' and with no frictional penalty on the bypassed lift cords 202. The advantage, as
best appreciated in Figure 32, is that both sets of lift cords 200, 202 may use the same set of
aligned rout openings 203 through the upper pleated shade portion 210 as these two sets of lift
cords 200, 202 travel in very close side-by-side relationship to each other, giving the impression
of a single cord.
[0143]       Referring to Figure 38, each of the lift stations 114' includes a base 222, a cover 224,
and a spool 218 mounted for rotation inside the cavity 226 formed by the base 222 and the
cover 224 as they snap together, as shown in Figures 35 and 36. The spool 218 is completely
enclosed by the housing formed by the base 222 and the cover 224, with the end of the lift cord
200 secured to the spool 218 such that rotation of the spool 218 around its longitudinal axis
results in the lift cord 200 winding up onto the spool 218 (or unwinding, depending on the
direction of rotation of the spool 218). The spool 218 defines a hollow shaft 228 with a non
circular profile (See Figure 34) to positively engage a lift rod 230 (See Figure 32) such that
rotation of the lift rod 230 results in rotation of the spools of the lift stations 114' and vice versa.
                                                     22

[0144]      As may be appreciated from Figures 33, 34, and 35, the base 222 includes an inlet
nozzle 206 which defines first and second through openings 232, 234 (See Figure 35). The first
opening 232 receives the first lift cord 200 and guides it into the cavity 226, and the lift cord 200
is then secured to the spool 218 of the lift station 114'. The second opening 234 extends
through an open channel 235 (See Figure 39) in the end of the base 222 and also connects to
the cavity 226.
[0145]      The cover 224 defines first and second through openings 236, 238 (See Figures 34
and 35) which lead from the cavity 226 to the outside of the lift station 114'. At least one of the
openings 236, 238 lines up vertically with the corresponding opening 234 on the base 222,
depending on the configuration of the lift station 114'. That is, the cover 224 is a universal cover
to be used regardless of whether the lift station 114' is a right hand station (as shown in Figure
34, wherein the inlet nozzle 206 is offset to the right of the hollow shaft 228 of the spool 218 and
wherein the opening 236 on the cover 224 lines up with the opening 234 on the base 222) or a
left hand station (as shown in Figure 33, wherein the inlet nozzle 206 is offset to the left of the
hollow shaft 228 of the spool 218 and wherein the opening 238 on the cover 224 lines up with
the opening 234 on the base 222). In either case, the lift cord 202 extends straight through the
lift station 114' without affecting the functionality of the lift station 114' and with no frictional
penalty on the lift cord 202, as best appreciated in Figure 36.
[0146]      This same bypass arrangement can be achieved using the lift cord routing cap 26 of
Figures 3-5.
[0147]       Referring now to Figure 37, the inlet nozzle 206 defines a tapered, "U"-shaped
collection trough 240 which lies at an angle defined by the imaginary line 242. The trough 234
is narrower at the top than at the bottom. The imaginary line 242 defining the slope of the wall
of the trough at the midpoint of the trough 240 intersects the vertical axes of both openings 232,
234. Of course, those points of intersection are at different heights due to the skewed nature of
the axis 242. The walls of the trough 240 are radiused inwardly to help collect and consolidate
any loose ends of the lift cord, as described below.
[0148]      To feed the lift cord 200 through the opening 232, the end of the lift cord 200 is
pressed into the trough 240. The act of pressing the end of the lift cord 200 into the trough 240
forces any loose ends/frayed ends to come together in the trough 240. Also, as the cord is
                                                    23

pulled upwardly, the ends of the cord are squeezed together by the narrowing wall of the trough.
The lift cord 200 also may be rotated (or twirled) so all sides of the cord come into contact with
the trough 240 in order to press together the frayed ends on all sides of the cord 200.
[0149]      It is then a simple matter of lowering the consolidated end of the lift cord 200 into the
opening 232. The same procedure is followed to feed the lift cord 202 through the opening 234.
[0150]      This trough and feeding arrangement also may be provided on the lift cord routing cap
26 of Figures 3-5.
[0151]      To assemble the lift station 114' the end of the first lift cord 200 is inserted into the
upper portion of the trough 240, as discussed above, and the end is pushed into the opening
232 of the base 222 of the lift station 114'. Once the end of the lift cord 200 enters into the
cavity 226 (before the cover 224 is assembled to the base 222) the lift cord 200 is secured to
the spool 218. Next, the second lift cord 202 is likewise threaded through the second opening
234 of the inlet nozzle 206, with the aid of the trough 240, as discussed above. Once the
second lift cord 202 enters into the cavity 226, it is threaded through the outlet opening (236 or
238) in the cover 224 until the end of the cord 202 exits the cover 224. The spool 218 is then
mounted for rotation inside the cavity 226, and the cover 224 is snapped onto the base 222.
The assembled lift station 114' may now be installed onto a lift rod 230 inside the intermediate
rail 214.
[0152]      Of course, the second lift cord 202 then extends downwardly through the covering 212
(see Fig. 31) and is secured to its respective spool in the bottom rail 220.
Alternate Embodiments of the Skew adjustment Mechanism Including an Auto-Lock for
the Opposite End of the Skew Adjustment Mechanism
[0153]      Referring back to Figure 2, it may be appreciated that the lift stations 14, 16 are both
powered by a common spring motor 76. As has been described above with respect to that
embodiment, the skew adjustment mechanism disengages the rightmost lift station 14 from the
lift rod 18 (and from the rest of the drive including the motor 76 and the leftmost lift station 16).
[0154]      If the lock mechanism 20 on the rail 12 is not a two-way lock as described above but
rather is a one-way lock, which allows the user to raise the movable rail 12 without disengaging
                                                   24

the lock 20, then it would be possible during the skew adjustment process, while the rightmost
lift station 14 is disconnected from the drive train, for the motor 76 to overcome the weight of the
rail and the inertia in the system and begin to wind up the spool on the lift station 16, causing an
unintended rise of the left end of the bottom rail 12 of the shade 10 while the user is adjusting
the skew on the rightmost lift station 14.
[0155]       Figures 40- 53 show an alternate embodiment of a skew adjustment arrangement 300
with an auto-lock feature to ensure that the lift rod 18 is locked against rotation to prevent the
unintended rise of the shade 10 while the skew is being adjusted.
[0156]       Referring to Figures 40 and 41, the skew adjustment arrangement 300 (shown with
the rail omitted for clarity) includes a removable end cap 302, which is nearly identical to the end
cap 102 of Figure 13, except that it has two inwardly projecting posts 165 (see Fig. 42C) having
a circular cross-section, which are tapered to have a smaller diameter at the end and a larger
diameter where they connect to the flat portion of the end cap 302. The post 165 that is aligned
with the skew adjustment shaft 308 is received in a complementary recess in the center of the
head 330 of the skew adjustment shaft 308 and abuts the end of the skew adjustment shaft 308
with a small diameter to support thrust loads and minimize thrust friction.
[0157]      The skew adjustment arrangement 300 also includes a skew adjustment tool 304,
which is functionally identical to the skew adjustment tool 120 of Figure 13, but it has a head
354 that is shaped a little differently from the head 130 of the skew adjustment tool 120 of
Figure 13. The head 354 of this tool 304 has curved surfaces 142A and flat walls 144A, which
correspond to the curved surfaces 142 and flat walls 144 of the tool 120, but it also has a central
post 165A, which has the same shape as the posts 165 of the end cap 302. This makes the
head 354 of this tool 304 have a complementary shape to the head 330 of the skew adjustment
shaft 308 so it can depress the skew adjustment shaft 308 and drive the skew adjustment shaft
308 in just one direction, as with the previous embodiment. The skew adjustment tool 304 also
defines a hole 355, which receives a string that ties the tool 304 to the end lock 306.
[0158]      The skew adjustment assembly 300 also includes an end lock 306 (functionally
identical to the end lock 118 of Figure 13), a slider lock guide 310, a connector rod 312, a lift rod
extension 314, a slider lock 316, a biasing spring 318, a lift station 320 (identical to the lift
station 114 of Figure 13), a skew adjustment mechanism 322 (similar to the skew adjustment
                                                   25

mechanism 112 of Figures 10 and 13), and a coupler 324 (functionally similar to the coupler 40
of the skew adjustment mechanism 112 shown in Figure 10).
[0159]     This skew adjustment assembly 300 operates in substantially the same way as the
skew adjustment assembly shown in Figures 10 and 13. Referring to the assembly of Figures
10 and 13, as the user pushes in on the skew adjustment shaft 116 (which slides through the
hollow shaft of the spool of the lift station 114 while rotationally engaging the spool) the skew
adjustment shaft 116 pushes in on the plunger 34A to disengage it from the wrap spring 80.
The spool can now be rotated by rotating the skew adjustment shaft 116 in order to raise this
end of the movable rail without driving the opposite end lift station.
[0160]      Once the user releases the skew adjustment shaft 116 (by removing the tool 120 he
used to press in on and rotate the head 128 of the skew adjustment shaft 116), the compression
spring 36 pushes the plunger 34A to re-engage the plunger 34A with the wrap spring 80. Now,
when the lift rod adapter 38A rotates (driven by the lift rod 18 of Figure 2), it drives the wrap
spring 80, which drives the plunger 34A, which drives the skew adjustment shaft 116, which in
turn drives the spool 28 of the lift station 114. Note that the coupler 40 snaps onto the lift station
114, both of which are fixed against rotation relative to the movable rail 106.
[0161]     There are only a few differences between this arrangement of Figures 40-41 and the
arrangement of Figures 10 and 13.
[0162]      In this embodiment, the skew adjustment shaft 308 and lift rod extension 314 replace
the skew adjustment shaft 116 of the earlier embodiment. The skew adjustment tool 304 is very
similar to the tool 120 of Figure 13. The skew adjustment tool 304 is used to push in on and
rotate the skew adjustment shaft 308, which in turn pushes in on and rotates the lift rod
extension 314. As best shown in Figure 44, the skew adjustment shaft 308 defines a non
circular-profiled hollow shaft 326, which receives the end of the lift rod extension 314 so the
shaft 308 and lift rod extension 314 rotate together.
[0163]     The skew adjustment shaft 308 also defines an axial shoulder 328 (best shown in
Figure 43) approximately midway between its first end 330 (which defines the head on the skew
adjustment shaft 308) and its second end 332 (which defines the opening to the hollow shaft
326), and a smaller diameter portion 334 is defined forward of the shoulder 328. The smaller
                                                   26

diameter portion 334 is received in an opening 336 (See Figure 41) in the end lock 306. This
supports the skew adjustment shaft 308 for rotation and allows it to slide axially so as to push
against the compression spring 36 (See Figure 10) to disengage the lift station 320 from the rest
of the drive when pressed in by the tool 304. When the tool 304 is removed, the compression
spring 36 pushes the skew adjustment shaft 308 back out. However, the shoulder 328 prevents
the skew adjustment shaft 308 from shooting out through the opening 336 in the end lock 306
(the opening through which the tool 304 gains access to the head 330 of the skew adjustment
shaft 308).
[0164]       The coupler 324 snaps onto the housing of the lift station 320, both of which are fixed
against rotation relative to the rail which houses them (such as the bottom rail 106 of Figure 13).
As shown in Figure 46, the coupler 324 defines a "U"-shaped channel 338, which slidably
receives the slider lock 316, which is shown in Figures 41 and 45. One end of the "U"-shaped
channel 338 is blocked off by a tab 340 (See also Figure 47). The biasing spring 318 is
received in the slider lock 316, with one end of the biasing spring 318 pushing against the tab
340 of the coupler 324 and the other end of the biasing spring 318 pushing against an inner wall
342 of the slider lock 316, as best shown in Figure 47. The spring 318 biases the slider lock
316 in the direction of the arrow 344.
[0165]       One end 346 of the slider lock 316 defines a finger 348 (See Figures 45 and 47)
which is also biased in the direction of the arrow 344 by the same spring 318. The opposite end
350 of the slider lock 316 defines an opening 352 with a non-circular cross-section, which
receives one end of the connector rod 312, as shown in Figure 40. The other end of the
connector rod 312 is received in the slider lock guide 310, shown in Figure 41. As explained in
more detail below, the slider lock guide 310 is moved axially by the insertion or removal of the
skew adjustment tool 304 from the end lock 306.
[0166]       When the slider lock 316 is biased outwardly by the spring 318, the finger 348 is
received in the opening 356 in the coupler 324. Also, as soon as one of the two openings 358
in the lift rod adapter 38 (See Figures 4 and 6) lines up with the opening 356 in the coupler 324,
the finger 348 of the slider lock 316 moves to the right (urged in that direction by the biasing
spring 318), entering into the opening 358 in the lift rod adapter 38 to lock the lift rod adapter 38
against further rotation, which locks the lift rod 18 against rotation and thereby prevents the
                                                   27

spring motor 76, shown in Figure 2, from driving the lift station 16 on the left (or any other lift
stations that may be operably connected to the lift rod 18).
[0167]     We now refer to Figures 48-53 to explain the sequence of events involved in adjusting
the skew of the movable or bottom rail 106 (See Figure 11) when this embodiment of the skew
adjustment mechanism is used. In Figure 48, the skew adjustment assembly 300 is shown with
the skew adjustment tool 304 in its stowed condition. The end cap 302 is attached to the end
lock 306, and the post 165 of the end cap 302 which is aligned with the end of the skew
adjustment tool 304 pushes the skew adjustment tool 304 against the slider lock guide 310.
This, in turn, pushes the slider lock 316, via the connector rod 312, in the direction opposite the
arrow 344. This compresses the biasing spring 318 and moves the finger 348 of the slider lock
316 out of the coupler 324. So, when the skew adjustment tool 304 is in its stowed position and
the end cap 302 is mounted on the end lock 306, the finger 348 of the slider lock 316 is out of
the coupler 324 and out of the opening 358 in the lift rod adapter, which allows the lift rod 18 to
rotate.
[0168]     To adjust the skew of the rail 106, the end cap 302 is removed, as shown in Figure
49. This allows the biasing spring 318 to push the slider lock 316 toward the right, in the
direction of the arrow 344, which pushes on the connector rod 312 and the slider lock guide
310, which forces the skew adjustment tool 304 to "pop" out of the end lock 306. The biasing
spring 318 continues pushing the slider lock guide 310 to the right (in the direction of the arrow
344) until the finger 348 extends through the opening 356 in the coupler 324.
[0169]     The user removes the skew adjustment tool 304 from the end lock 306, as shown in
Figure 50, aligns the skew adjustment tool 304 with the opening 336 in the end lock 306, as
shown in Figure 51, and inserts the skew adjustment tool 304 in through the opening 336 in the
end lock 306 as shown in Figure 52. Finally, the user pushes in on the skew adjustment tool
304 against the skew adjustment shaft 308 and rotates the skew adjustment tool 304 to adjust
the skew of the rail, as shown in Figure 53.
[0170]     As the user pushes the skew adjustment tool 304 in against the skew adjustment
shaft 308 and some of the weight is taken off of the rail, the lift rod adapter 38 (See Figures 4
and 6) may rotate, as it is driven by the torque of the spring motor 76 (See Figure 2). However,
the biasing spring 318 pushes the finger 348 of the slider lock 316 to the right, so the finger 348
                                                  28

extends into the opening 358 in the lift rod adapter 38 to lock the lift rod adapter 38 against
rotation, thereby preventing the spring motor 20, shown in Figure 2, from driving the lift station
16 on the left (or any other lift stations that may be operably connected to the lift rod 18).
[0171]     With the lift rod adapter 38 locked to the coupler 324 via the finger 348 in the slider
lock 316 (and keeping in mind that the coupler 324 snaps onto the housing of the rightmost lift
station 320, both of which are mounted against rotation relative to the rail), the entire drive
mechanism to the left of the rightmost lift station 320 (or, if referring to Figure 2, the entire drive
mechanism to the left of the rightmost lift station 14, including the lift rod 18, the spring motor
76, and the leftmost lift station 16) is locked against rotation, and thus locked against
unintended raising of the rail 12 while adjusting the skew at the rightmost lift station 14.
[0172]      Once the skew adjustment procedure is completed, the user removes the skew
adjustment tool 304 from the head 330 of the skew adjustment shaft 308 and stows it back
through the opening 360 in the end lock 306 (See Figure 41), pushing the slider lock guide 310,
the connector rod 312, and the slider lock 316 to the left, in the direction opposite the arrow 344.
This extracts the finger 348 of the slider lock 316 out of the opening 358 in the lift rod adapter
38, which unlocks the lift rod adapter 38 such that the entire drive mechanism can once again
rotate in unison to raise or lower the shade 10.
Another alternative skew adjustment mechanism with a locking feature
[0173]      Figures 54- 61 show an alternate embodiment of a skew adjustment mechanism 400
with an auto-lock feature to ensure that the lift rod and the drive mechanism to the left of the
rightmost lift station 14 (the lift station where the skew adjustment is taking place) are locked
against rotation to prevent the unintended rise of the shade 10 while the skew is being adjusted.
Again, as with the other alternative skew adjustment mechanisms, this skew adjustment
mechanism 400 could be inserted to replace the skew adjustment mechanism on a rail of the
covering, such as replacing the skew adjustment mechanism on the rail 12 of Figure 2 or
replacing the skew adjustment mechanism on the rail 14 of Figure 9.
[0174]      Referring to Figures 54 and 55, the skew adjustment mechanism 400 (shown only
with the items corresponding to the skew adjustment mechanism in the lift station 14 of Figure 3
                                                    29

and 4, all other items omitted for clarity) includes a plunger 402, a lock plate 404, a biasing
spring 406, a lift rod adapter 408, and a coupler 410.
[0175]      This skew adjustment assembly 400 operates in a similar, but not identical, manner as
the skew adjustment assembly shown in Figure 4. The main difference is that the teeth 412 on
the plunger 402 are located on the outer perimeter of the plunger 402 rather than on its front
face, and they mesh with teeth 414 on the inner surface of the lift rod adapter 408 instead of
meshing with teeth 58 on the face of the plunger housing cap 32.
[0176]       In this new embodiment of a skew adjustment mechanism 400, pushing in on the
skew adjustment shaft 24 (See Figures 60 and 61) pushes in on the plunger 402, which
disengages the circumferential teeth 412 of the plunger 402 from the four sets of
circumferentially-spaced-apart teeth 414 (See Figure 55) on the inner surface of the lift rod
adapter 408, as best appreciated in Figure 61.
[0177]       In the present embodiment 400, the biasing spring 406 urges the lock plate 404
against the plunger 402 and biases both of these components 402, 404 to the right (as seen
from the frame of reference of Figure 55) to force the circumferential teeth 412 of the plunger
402 to engage the teeth 414 of the lift rod adapter 408 such that both components 402, 404
rotate as one. When the teeth 412 and 414 are engaged, the plunger 402, the lock plate 404,
the lift rod adapter 408, the skew adjustment shaft 24, and the spool 28 all rotate together.
[0178]       Referring to Figures 55 and 57, the lock plate 404 defines four circumferentially
mounted and axially-projecting fingers 416 which project through corresponding through
openings 418 (See Figure 58) in the lift rod adapter 408, as shown in Figure 60. As the user
pushes in on the skew adjustment shaft 24 (See Figures 60 and 61) using a skew adjustment
tool (not shown in these views, but similar to the skew adjustment tool 304 of Figure 41), he not
only pushes the plunger 402 toward the left, to disengage the teeth 412 of the plunger 402 from
the teeth 414 of the lift rod adapter 408, but the plunger 402 in turn pushes the lock plate 404 to
the left so that the fingers 416 of the lock plate 404 project not only through the openings 418 of
the lift rod adapter 408 but also through the through-openings 420 (See Figures 59-61) of the
coupler 410, which locks the lift rod adapter 408 and the lift rod 18 against rotation.
                                                   30

[0179]      As best appreciated in Figure 61, the fingers 416 of the lock plate 404 extend through
the openings 418 in the lift rod adapter 408 and through the openings 420 in the coupler 410,
thus preventing relative rotation between these two components 408, 410. That is, the lift rod
adapter 408 is now locked against rotation relative to the coupler 410, which, in turn, is locked
onto the housing of the lift station 14.
[0180]      The housing of the lift station 14 is mounted for non-rotation relative to the rail (either
by mounting the lift station 14 directly onto the rail or via the end lock 118 as shown in Figures
60 and 61). In any event, once the skew adjustment shaft 24 is pushed in by the user and the
fingers 416 on the lock plate 404 project through the openings in both the lift rod adapter 408
and the coupler 410, the lift rod adapter 408 is immobilized, locking the entire drive to the left of
the lift rod adapter 408 against rotation. The skew on the movable rail of the covering now may
be corrected by rotating the skew adjustment shaft 24 which also rotates the spool 28 of the
rightmost lift station 14, while the drive 16 to the left of the rightmost lift station 14 remains
locked against rotation. If desired, in this embodiment, the head of the skew adjustment shaft
24 and the head of the skew adjustment tool may be modified to be a more traditional drive,
such as a Phillips head or a square or hex head to permit the tool to drive the skew adjustment
shaft 24 in either direction.
[0181]       Referring to Figure 60, when the skew adjustment shaft 24 has not been pushed in by
the user, and the shade is being raised or lowered, the lift rod adapter 408 is rotating. The teeth
412 of the plunger 402 are engaging the teeth 414 of the lift rod adapter 408, so the plunger 402
is also rotating. The skew adjustment shaft 24 rotationally engages the non-circular profiled
hollow shaft 422 (See Figure 56) of the plunger 402 so the skew adjustment shaft 24 is also
rotating. Finally, the skew adjustment shaft 24 (See also Figure 4) engages the spool 28 of the
rightmost lift station 14 to raise or lower the shade.
[0182]       Referring to Figure 61, when the skew adjustment shaft 24 is pushed in by the user,
the plunger 402 disengages from the lift rod adapter 408 so that the spool 24 of the lift station
14 may be rotated to adjust the skew on the movable rail without driving the lift station on the
opposite end of the movable rail.
                                                   31

[0183]      It should be noted that the parts are shaped and sized so that the fingers 416 are
always engaging the holes 418, and the teeth 412, 414 do not disengage from each other until
the fingers 416 enter into the holes 420.
[0184]      While the terms "clockwise" and "left" and "right" have been used here, they have
been used to describe the operation of specific embodiments and are not intended to be
limiting. It is understood that the mechanisms could be reversed so that what is performed in a
clockwise direction in one embodiment could be performed in a counterclockwise direction in
another embodiment, and what is on the left side in one embodiment could be on the right side
in another embodiment.
Skew adjustments for multiple configurations of window coverings
[0185]      Thus far several embodiments of skew adjustment mechanisms have been described
to adjust the skew of a movable rail having two lift cords. A skew adjustment may also be used
where there is more than one movable rail and where there are more than just two lift cords.
For example, when the window covering is wider than usual or when the rail is heavier than
usual, it may be desirable to have more than just two lift cords per movable rail. Figures 62 - 72
are schematics showing different window covering configurations and how the skew may be
adjusted for these arrangements.
[0186]      Figure 62 represents a shade 430 (it could also be a blind but for simplicity we shall
refer to it as a shade) with a top rail 432, a bottom (first movable) rail 434 and fabric 436
extending from the top rail 432 to the bottom rail 434. The bottom rail 434 is suspended from
the top rail 432 via first and second lift cords 438, 440, each of which is operatively connected to
its corresponding lift station 442, 444. The lift stations 442, 444 are interconnected by a lift rod
448 such that both lift stations 442, 444 rotate in unison unless the skew adjustment mechanism
446 temporarily disengages the rightmost lift station 444 from the rest of the drive train, as has
been described above.
[0187]      This shade 430 of Figure 62 has been described at length above and is essentially the
shade 100 of Figure 11 with, for example, the skew adjustment mechanism 400 of Figures 54
and 55. To adjust the skew of the shade 430 of Figure 62, the skew adjustment mechanism
446 is actuated (as described above) to temporarily disengage the lift station 444 from the lift
                                                   32

rod 448, and the lift cord 440 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually winding up
(or unwinding) the lift cord 440 from the lift station 444 until the skew condition has been
corrected. The bottom rail 434 pivots up or down about the point where the left lift cord 438
meets the left lift station 442. It should be noted that in this sketch, as well in the sketches that
follow, the location of the drive mechanism (the lift stations 442, 444, the lift rod 448, and the
skew adjustment mechanism 446) may just as readily be in the top rail 432 instead of the
bottom rail 434 as shown, and that, while the upper rail 432 usually is fixed relative to the
architectural opening, it also may be a movable rail. So, in fact, both rails 432, 434 may be
movable rails.
[0188]      Figure 63 is a sketch of a shade 430', similar to the shade 430 of Figure 62, except
that it has three lift cords 438, 440, 440' operatively connected to corresponding lift stations.
The left lift cord 438 is operatively connected to the left lift station 442, the right lift cord 440 is
operatively connected to the right lift station 444, and the intermediate lift cord 440', which is
actually an extension of the right lift cord 440, is operatively connected to an intermediate lift
station 450. The lift stations 442, 444, 450 are interconnected by a lift rod 448 such that the lift
stations 442, 444, 450 rotate in unison unless the skew adjustment mechanism 446 temporarily
disengages the rightmost lift station 444 from the drive train, as has been described above. As
mentioned earlier, the two lift cords 440, 440' are actually a single lift cord which extends from
the right lift station 444 up to the top rail 432, over pulleys 452 in the top rail 432, and then back
down to the intermediate lift station 450 in the bottom rail 434.
[0189]      It should be noted that, while pulleys 452 are used in these embodiments, any turning
point would work instead of a pulley. For example, the pulleys 452 could be replaced by
projections that are made of a material (or are coated with a material) that provides a good wear
surface.
[0190]      To adjust the skew of the shade 430' of Figure 63, the skew adjustment mechanism
446 is actuated to temporarily disengage the lift station 444 from the lift rod 448, and the lift cord
440 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually winding up (or unwinding) the lift cord
440 from the lift station 444 until the skew condition has been corrected. As the length of the lift
cord 440 is being adjusted, the bottom rail 434 pivots up or down about the point where the lift
cord 438 meets the lift station 442. As the lift cord 440 is shortened, it shifts relative to the
                                                    33

pulleys 452, thereby also shortening the intermediate lift cord 440', so that, once the skew has
been adjusted, the intermediate lift cord 440' is also the correct length.
[0191]       Figure 64 is a sketch of a shade 430", similar to the shade 430' of Figure 63, except
that it has four lift cords 438, 438', 440', 440 operatively connected to their corresponding lift
stations 442, 454, 450, 444. The left lift cord 438 and left intermediate lift cord 438' are actually
a single lift cord, which extends from the lift station 442 up to the top rail 432, over pulleys 452 in
the top rail 432 and back down to the lift station 454 in the bottom rail 434. Similarly, the right lift
cord 440 and right intermediate lift cord 440' are actually the same cord, which extends from the
lift station 444 up to the top rail 432, over pulleys 452 in the top rail 432 and back down to the lift
station 450 in the bottom rail 434.
[0192]      The lift stations 442, 454, 450, 444 are interconnected by a lift rod 448 such that they
rotate in unison unless the skew adjustment mechanism 446 temporarily disengages the
rightmost lift station 444, as has been described above.
[0193]      To adjust the skew of the shade 430" of Figure 64, the skew adjustment mechanism
446 is actuated to temporarily disengage the lift station 444 from the lift rod 448, and the lift cord
440 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually winding up (or unwinding) the lift cord
440 from the lift station 444 until the skew condition has been corrected. As was the case with
the shade 430' of Figure 63, as the lift cord 440 is shortened, it shifts relative to the pulleys 452,
so the lift cord 440' also is shortened so it will be the correct length when the skew adjustment is
completed.
[0194]      As the length of the right lift cord 440 is being adjusted to change the skew or angle of
the bottom rail, the bottom rail 434 pivots up or down about a point intermediate the left lift
station 442 and the left intermediate lift station 454. That is, if the rightmost end of the bottom
rail 434 is being raised, the left lift station 442 actually drops a little bit while the left intermediate
lift station 454 is raised a little bit so that the overall length of the lift cord 438, 438' remains
unchanged. The left/left intermediate lift cord 438, 438' just slides over the pulleys 452 in the
top rail 432 to automatically adjust the relative lengths of the left lift cord segment 438 and left
intermediate lift cord segment 438' as the angle of the bottom rail 434 is being adjusted. This
ensures that none of the lift cords will become slack, and all the lift cords will remain taut
throughout the adjustment process.

[0195]       Figure 65 is a schematic of a top down/bottom up shade 460 including a top rail 462,
a first (intermediate) movable rail 464 suspended from the top rail 462 via first and second lift
cords 468, 470 each of which is operatively connected to its corresponding lift station 472, 474.
The lift stations 472, 474 are interconnected by a lift rod 478 such that both lift stations 472, 474
rotate in unison unless the skew adjustment mechanism 476 temporarily disengages the
rightmost lift station 474.
[0196]      A second (bottom) movable rail 466 suspended from the intermediate movable rail
464 via third and fourth lift cords 480, 482, each of which is operatively connected to its
corresponding lift station 484, 486. The lift stations 484, 486 are interconnected by a lift rod 490
such that both lift stations 484, 486 rotate in unison unless the skew adjustment mechanism 488
temporarily disengages the rightmost lift station 486. Fabric 487 extends from the intermediate
rail 464 to the bottom rail 466. In this particular embodiment, there is no fabric or other covering
between the top rail 462 and the intermediate movable rail 464, but there could be a fabric
between those two rails 462, 464 as well.
[0197]      To adjust the skew of the bottom rail 466 of the shade 460 of Figure 65, the skew
adjustment mechanism 488 is actuated to temporarily disengage the lift station 486 from the lift
rod 490, and the lift cord 482 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually winding up
(or unwinding) the lift cord 482 from the lift station 486 until the skew condition has been
corrected. The bottom rail 466 pivots up or down about the point where the lift cord 480 meets
the lift station 484.
[0198]      To adjust the skew of the intermediate rail 464 of the shade 460 of Figure 65, the
skew adjustment mechanism 476 is actuated to temporarily disengage the lift station 474 from
the lift rod 478, and the lift cord 470 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually
winding up (or unwinding) the lift cord 470 from the lift station 474 until the skew condition has
been corrected. The intermediate rail 464 pivots up or down about the point where the lift cord
468 meets the lift station 472. Of course, it may be necessary to readjust the skew of the
bottom rail 466 after adjusting the skew of the intermediate rail 464. Preferably, the skew of the
intermediate rail 464 is adjusted first, and then the skew of the bottom rail 466 is adjusted.
[0199]       Figure 66 is a schematic of a shade 460', similar to the shade 460 of Figure 65,
except that it has three lift cords 480, 492, 482 extending between the intermediate rail 464 and
                                                    35

the bottom rail 466. The lift cords 480, 492, 482 are operatively connected to corresponding lift
stations 484, 494, 486 on the bottom movable rail 466. The left and right lift stations 484, 486
are interconnected by a lift rod 490 such that the left and right lift stations 484, 486 rotate in
unison unless the skew adjustment mechanism 446 temporarily disengages the rightmost lift
station 444, as has been described above. The intermediate lift station 494 is not operatively
connected to the lift rod 490 and has its own spring motor which is used just to keep the cord
492 taut in order to prevent slack in that cord 492. The intermediate lift station 494 thus is really
just a cord take-up station. In this embodiment, the intermediate lift station 494 includes a wind
up spool (similar to the lift station 114' of Figure 35), but it also includes a close-coupled coiled
spring motor 496 which is wound up onto itself when the bottom rail 466 is pulled down by the
user, unwinding the lift cord 492 from the cord take-up station 494 and charging (coiling up) the
spring motor 496. When the bottom rail 466 is raised, the spring motor 496 automatically
rotates the spool of the cord take-up station 494 to collect the lift cord 492 so as to remove any
slack from the lift cord 492, keeping the lift cord 492 taut. In this embodiment the cord take-up
station 494 and its corresponding spring motor 496 are mounted in the bottom rail 466 and the
bottom lift rod 490 extends through, but does not engage, the wind-up spool of the cord take-up
station 494 and its corresponding spring motor 496. Of course, this is only for convenience; the
cord take-up station 494 and its corresponding spring motor 496 may be mounted in the bottom
rail 466 (or in the intermediate movable rail 464) in a location where they have no interaction
with the corresponding lift rod 490, 478.
[0200]       Since the cord take-up station 494 is independent of the lift rod 490, the spool that
winds up the cord 492 may be oriented as desired. For example, it may be coaxial with the lift
rod 490 or transaxial to the lift rod 490. Similarly, the spring motor 496 may be oriented as
desired. For example, it may be coaxial with the lift rod 490 or transaxial to the lift rod 490, and
it may be coaxial with the spool or transaxial to the spool.
[0201]      To adjust the skew of the bottom rail 466 of the shade 460' of Figure 66, the skew
adjustment mechanism 488 is actuated to temporarily disengage the right lift station 486 from
the lift rod 490, and the lift cord 482 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually
winding up (or unwinding) the lift cord 482 from the lift station 486 until the skew condition has
been corrected. The bottom rail 466 pivots up or down about the point where the left lift cord
480 meets the left lift station 484. The cord take-up station 494 automatically winds up to take
up any slack generated in the intermediate lift cord 492 by the raising of the bottom rail 446 (or
                                                    36

unwinds to mete out some lift cord 492 if the bottom rail 466 is being lowered instead of being
raised).
[0202]      The skew of the intermediate rail 464 of the shade 460' is adjusted in the same
manner as it is adjusted for the shade 460 of Figure 5 as discussed above.
[0203]       Figure 67 is a schematic of a shade 460", similar to the shade 460' of Figure 66,
except that it has four lift cords 480, 498, 492, 482 operatively connected to their corresponding
lift stations 484, 500, 494, 486. The left and right lift stations 484, 486 are interconnected by a
lift rod 490 such that both lift stations 484, 486 rotate in unison unless the skew adjustment
mechanism 488 temporarily disengages the rightmost lift station 486, as has been described
above. However, as in the earlier case shown in Figure 66, the intermediate lift stations 500,
494 are not connected to the lift rod 490 and have their own spring motors that only serve to
keep the intermediate cords 498, 492 taut.
[0204]      To adjust the skew of the bottom rail 466 of the shade 460" of Figure 67, the skew
adjustment mechanism 488 is actuated to temporarily disengage the right lift station 486 from
the lift rod 490, and the lift cord 482 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually
winding up (or unwinding) the lift cord 482 from the lift station 486 until the skew condition has
been corrected. The bottom rail 466 pivots up or down about the point where the left lift cord
480 meets the left lift station 484. The cord take-up stations 500, 494 automatically take up any
slack or mete out cord as needed in the lift cords 498, 492, respectively, as the skew of the
bottom rail 466 is being adjusted.
[0205]      The skew of the intermediate rail 464 of the shade 460" is adjusted in the same
manner as it is adjusted for the shade 460 of Figure 5 as discussed above.
[0206]       Figure 68 is a sketch of a dual fabric shade 500 including a top rail 502, a first
(intermediate) movable rail 504 suspended from the top rail 502 via first and second lift cords
506, 508 each of which are operatively connected to their corresponding lift stations 510, 512.
The lift stations 510, 512 are interconnected by a lift rod 514 such that both lift stations 510, 512
rotate in unison unless the skew adjustment mechanism 516 temporarily disengages the
rightmost lift station 512. Fabric 518 extends from the top rail 502 to the intermediate rail 504.
                                                    37

[0207]      A second (bottom) movable rail 520 also is suspended from the top rail 502 via third
and fourth lift cords 522, 524 each of which is operatively connected to its corresponding lift
station 526, 528. The lift stations 526, 528 are interconnected by a lift rod 530 such that both lift
stations 526, 528 rotate in unison unless the skew adjustment mechanism 532 temporarily
disengages the rightmost lift station 528. Fabric 534 extends from the intermediate rail 504 to
the bottom rail 520.
[0208]      To adjust the skew of the bottom rail 520 of the shade 500 of Figure 68, the skew
adjustment mechanism 532 is actuated to temporarily disengage the lift station 528 from the lift
rod 530, and the lift cord 524 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually winding up
(or unwinding) the lift cord 524 from the lift station 528 until the skew condition has been
corrected. The bottom rail 520 pivots up or down about the point where the lift cord 522 meets
the lift station 526.
[0209]      To adjust the skew of the intermediate rail 504 of the shade 500 of Figure 68, the
skew adjustment mechanism 516 is actuated to temporarily disengage the lift station 512 from
the lift rod 514, and the lift cord 508 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually
winding up (or unwinding) the lift cord 508 from the lift station 512 until the skew condition has
been corrected. The intermediate rail 504 pivots up or down about the point where the lift cord
506 meets the lift station 510. In this case, adjusting the skew of the intermediate rail 504 does
not affect the skew of the bottom rail 520.
[0210]       Figure 69 is a sketch of a shade 500', similar to the shade 500 of Figure 68, except
that it has three lift cords 506, 536, 508 extending from the top rail 502 and operatively
connected to their corresponding lift stations 510, 538, 512 for the intermediate rail 504 and
three lift cords 522, 540, 524 extending from the top rail 502 and operatively connected to their
corresponding lift stations 526, 542, 532 for the bottom rail 520. The lift stations 510, 512 are
interconnected by a lift rod 514 such that both lift stations 510, 512 rotate in unison unless the
skew adjustment mechanism 516 temporarily disengages the rightmost lift station 512. Fabric
518 extends from the top rail 502 to the intermediate rail 504. The lift stations 526, 528 are
interconnected by a lift rod 530 such that both lift stations 526, 528 rotate in unison unless the
skew adjustment mechanism 532 temporarily disengages the rightmost lift station 528. Fabric
534 extends from the intermediate rail 504 to the bottom rail 520. The intermediate lift stations
538, 542 are not driven by the lift rods 514, 530 and are only cord take-up stations 538, 542,
                                                    38

having spring motors that keep the cord taut. These cord take-up stations 538, 542 are identical
to the cord take-up station 494 discussed earlier with respect to the shade 460' of Figure 66.
[0211]      To adjust the skew of the bottom rail 520 of the shade 500' of Figure 69, the skew
adjustment mechanism 532 is actuated to temporarily disengage the lift station 528 from the lift
rod 530, and the lift cord 524 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually winding up
(or unwinding) the lift cord 524 from the lift station 528 until the skew condition has been
corrected. The bottom rail 520 pivots up or down about the point where the lift cord 522 meets
the lift station 526. The cord take-up station 542 automatically takes up any slack generated in
the lift cord 540 by the raising of the bottom rail 520 (or metes out some lift cord 540 if the
bottom rail 520 is being lowered instead of being raised).
[0212]      To adjust the skew of the intermediate rail 504 of the shade 500' of Figure 69, the
skew adjustment mechanism 516 is actuated to temporarily disengage the lift station 512 from
the lift rod 514, and the lift cord 508 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually
winding up (or unwinding) the lift cord 508 from the lift station 512 until the skew condition has
been corrected. The intermediate rail 504 pivots up or down about the point where the lift cord
506 meets the lift station 510. The cord take-up station 538 automatically takes up any slack
generated in the lift cord 536 by the raising of the intermediate rail 504 (or metes out some lift
cord 536 if the intermediate rail 504 is being lowered instead of being raised).
[0213]       Figure 70 is a schematic of a shade 500", similar to the shade 500' of Figure 69,
except that it has a different arrangement for adjusting the skew without using cord take-up
stations. The shade 500" has three lift cords 506, 508', 508 operatively connected to their
corresponding lift stations 510, 544, 512 for the intermediate rail 504; and three lift cords 522,
524', 524 operatively connected to their corresponding lift stations 526, 546, 528 in the bottom
rail 520. The lift stations 510, 544, 516 are interconnected by a lift rod 514 such that they rotate
in unison unless the skew adjustment mechanism 516 temporarily disengages the rightmost lift
station 512. The lift stations 526, 546, 528 are interconnected by a lift rod 530 such that they
rotate in unison unless the skew adjustment mechanism 532 temporarily disengages the
rightmost lift station 528.
[0214]       Similar to the embodiment of Figure 63, the two lift cords 508, 508' are effectively a
single lift cord which extends from the lift station 512 up to the substantially parallel top rail 502,

504. Also, the two lift cords 524, 524' are effectively a single lift cord which extends from the lift
station 528 in the bottom rail 520, up to the top rail 502, which is substantially parallel to the
bottom rail 520, over pulleys 452' in the top rail 502 and back down to the lift station 546 in the
bottom rail 520.
[0215]      To adjust the skew of the bottom rail 520 of the shade 500" of Figure 70, the skew
adjustment mechanism 532 is actuated to temporarily disengage the lift station 528 from the lift
rod 530, and the lift cord 524 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually winding up
(or unwinding) the lift cord 524 from the lift station 528 until the skew condition has been
corrected. The bottom rail 520 pivots up or down about the point where the lift cord 522 meets
the lift station 526. The lift cord 524, 524' just slides over the pulleys 452' in the top rail 502 to
automatically keep both cords 524, 524' taut as the angle or skew of the bottom rail 520 is
adjusted.
[0216]      The skew of the intermediate rail 504 of the shade 500" of Figure 70 is adjusted in the
same manner, as the bottom rail 520. The skew adjustment mechanism 516 is actuated to
temporarily disengage the lift station 512 from the lift rod 514 and the lift cord 508 is shortened
(or lengthened) as required by manually winding up (or unwinding) the lift cord 508 from the lift
station 512 until the skew condition has been corrected. The intermediate rail 504 pivots up or
down about the point where the lift cord 506 meets the lift station 510. The lift cord 508, 508'
just slides over the pulleys 452 in the top rail 502 to keep the cords 508, 508' taut as the angle
of the rail 504 is adjusted.
[0217]       Figure 71 is a schematic of a shade 500*, similar to the shade 430" of Figure 64,
except that it has two movable rails 504, 520 suspended from the top rail 502 instead of just one
movable rail. Four lift cords 506, 506', 508', 508 operatively connect to corresponding lift
stations 510, 548, 544, 512 for the intermediate rail 504; and four lift cords 522, 522', 524', 524
operatively connect to corresponding lift stations 526, 550, 546, 528 for the bottom rail 520. The
lift stations 526, 550, 546, 528 are interconnected by a lift rod 530 such that they rotate in
unison unless the skew adjustment mechanism 532 temporarily disengages the rightmost lift
station 528. The lift stations 510, 548, 544, 512 are interconnected by a lift rod 514 such that
they rotate in unison unless the skew adjustment mechanism 532 temporarily disengages the
rightmost lift station 528.

[0218]      The lift cords 506, 506' are effectively a single lift cord which extends from the lift
station 510 in the intermediate rail 504, up to the substantially parallel top rail 502, over pulleys
452 in the top rail 502 and back down to the lift station 548 in the intermediate rail 504.
[0219]      The lift cords 508, 508' also are effectively a single lift cord which extends from the lift
station 512 in the intermediate rail 504, up to the substantially parallel top rail 502, over pulleys
452 in the top rail 502 and back down to the lift station 544 in the intermediate rail 504.
[0220]      The two lift cords 522, 522' are effectively a single lift cord which extends from the lift
station 526 in the bottom rail 520, up to the substantially parallel top rail 502, over pulleys 452'
in the top rail 502 and back down to the lift station 550 in the bottom rail 520.
[0221]      The two lift cords 524, 524' are effectively a single lift cord which extends from the lift
station 528 in the bottom rail 520, up to the substantially parallel top rail 502, over pulleys 452'
in the top rail 502 and back down to the lift station 546 in the bottom rail 520.
[0222]      To adjust the skew of the bottom rail 520 of the shade 500* of Figure 71, the skew
adjustment mechanism 532 is actuated to temporarily disengage the lift station 528 from the lift
rod 530, and the lift cord 524 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually winding up
(or unwinding) the lift cord 524 from the lift station 528 until the skew condition has been
corrected. The bottom rail 520 pivots up or down about a point intermediate the lift stations 526,
550. The lift cords 524, 524' and 522, 522' just slide over the pulleys 452' in the top rail 502 to
automatically adjust to the new position of the bottom rail 520.
[0223]      To adjust the skew of the intermediate rail 504 of the shade 500* of Figure 71, the
skew adjustment mechanism 516 is actuated to temporarily disengage the lift station 512 from
the lift rod 514 and the lift cord 508 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually
winding up (or unwinding) the lift cord 508 from the lift station 512 until the skew condition has
been corrected. The intermediate rail 504 pivots up or down about a point intermediate the lift
stations 510, 548. The lift cords 506, 506' and 508, 508' just slide over the pulleys 452 in the
top rail 502 to automatically adjust to the new position of the intermediate rail 504.

corresponding lift stations 510, 552, 556, 554, 512, 544 for the intermediate rail 504; and six lift
cords 522, 522', 560, 560', 524, 524' operatively connected to their corresponding lift stations
526, 562, 564, 566, 528, 546 for the bottom rail 520. The lift stations 510, 556, 512, 544 are
interconnected by a lift rod 514 such that they rotate in unison unless the skew adjustment
mechanism 532 temporarily disengages the rightmost lift station 528. The lift stations 526, 564,
528, 546 are interconnected by a lift rod 530 such that they rotate in unison unless the skew
adjustment mechanism 532 temporarily disengages the rightmost lift station 528.
[0225]    The intermediate lift stations 552, 554, 562, and 566 are not operatively connected to
the respective lift rods and operate as cord take-up stations instead of lift stations, just keeping
the cord taut, as described earlier with respect to other embodiments.
[0226]    The lift cords 506, 506' are effectively a single lift cord which extends from the lift
station 510 in the intermediate rail 504, up to the substantially parallel top rail 502, over pulleys
452 in the top rail 502 and back down to the take-up station 552 in the intermediate rail 504.

station 526 in the bottom rail 520, up to the parallel top rail 502, over pulleys 452' in the top rail
502 and back down to the take-up station 562 in the bottom rail 520.
[0230]    The two lift cords 560, 560' are effectively a single lift cord which extends from the lift
station 564 up to the parallel top rail 502, over pulleys 452' in the top rail 502 and back down to
the take-up station 566 in the bottom rail 520.

back down to the lift station 546 in the bottom rail 520.
[0232]      To adjust the skew of the bottom rail 520 of the shade 500** of Figure 72, the skew
adjustment mechanism 532 is actuated to temporarily disengage the lift station 528 from the lift
rod 530, and the lift cord 524 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually winding up
(or unwinding) the lift cord 524 from the lift station 528 until the skew condition has been
corrected. The lift cords 524, 524, 560, 560',' and 522, 522' just slide over the pulleys 452' in
the top rail 502 to automatically adjust to the new height of the bottom rail 520.
[0233]      To adjust the skew of the intermediate rail 504 of the shade 500** of Figure 72, the
skew adjustment mechanism 516 is actuated to temporarily disengage the lift station 512 from
the lift rod 514 and the lift cord 508 is shortened (or lengthened) as required by manually
winding up (or unwinding) the lift cord 508 from the lift station 512 until the skew condition has
