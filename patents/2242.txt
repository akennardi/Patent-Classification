          The present Application is a Divisional Application from Australian Patent
  Application No. 2014241045. The entire disclosures of Australian Patent Application No.
  2014241045 and its corresponding International Patent Application No.
  PCT/US2014/022908, are incorporated herein by reference.
          This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/779347,
  filed March 13, 2013, the entire content which is herein incorporated by reference.
                                                FIELD
          The present disclosure relates to the field of agricultural biotechnology and more
  specifically, to the field of transgenic crop plants and timing of herbicide applications.
                                           BACKGROUND
          Biotechnology has been used in Brassica species for many reasons, including canola
  variety improvements, yield increase, stress tolerance, modified oil consumption, and other
  improved traits such as herbicide tolerance. Regarding herbicide tolerance in the
  commercial production of brassica crops, it is desirable to easily and quickly eliminate
  unwanted plants (i.e., "weeds") from the field of Brassica.     One such treatment system
  would involve the use of crop plants which are tolerant to one or more herbicide(s) so that
  when the herbicide was sprayed on a field of herbicide-tolerant crop plants, the crop plants
  would continue to thrive while non-herbicide-tolerant weeds were killed or severely
  damaged.
          Herbicide tolerant varieties of canola have been developed to be resistant/tolerant to
5 certain herbicides. The ability of herbicide-resistant canola to control a broad spectrum of
  weeds has led to rapid adoption of the technology. Reduced tillage, increased yields, and
  improved weed control are several examples of the benefits of herbicide-resistant canola
  technology.     However, it is known that the response of canola to herbicide applications is
  highly dependent on the herbicide resistant system that is being used in the particular field.
0           Strategic herbicide application timing in herbicide tolerant canola varieties results
  in economic impact for canola producers because weed density and weed biomass are major
  restraints in canola production. There is a possibility for several applications of herbicides
                                                   2

  in herbicide-resistant canola crops and crop staging is one of the major drivers for
  determining appropriate herbicide application timing in canola.
           This disclosure relates to methods of applying glyphosate to improve weed control
  in a field containing herbicide tolerant brassica species, and more specifically, glyphosate
  tolerant brassica species.

  brassica plants express a glyphosate metabolizing enzyme; applying one or more additional
  glyphosate treatments comprising an effective amount of glyphosate over a population of
  glyphosate tolerant brassica plants, wherein a substantial portion of the brassica plants are at
  a stage that is beyond the 6-leaf stage; and obtaining brassica seeds from the brassica plants,
  wherein the yield loss is minimized due to a substantial reduction in discoloration or pod
  abortion after one or more late-stage applications of glyphosate.
          In an embodiment, the brassica plants express glyphosate acetyl transferase (GAT).
          In an embodiment, the average brassica yield is reduced by no more than 5%
  compared to a control treatment.
          Another aspect of the disclosure features a method of weed control in a field. The
  method comprises planting a population of glyphosate tolerant brassica plants in the field,
  wherein the brassica plants express a glyphosate acetyl transferase enzyme; and applying a

  glyphosate-tolerant brassica population in a field. The method comprises applying
  glyphosate treatment to the brassica population in the field, wherein the glyphosate
  treatment further comprises a disease control agent selected from the group consisting of
  insecticides, fungicides, and pesticides; and wherein a substantial portion of the brassica
0 population is beyond the 6-leaf stage and do not express an insensitive 5
  enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) and wherein the substantial portion of
  the brassica population does not show significant chlorosis.
          In an embodiment, the glyphosate treatment is applied beyond the first flower stage.
                                                  4

           In an embodiment, the glyphosate treatment is applied at about the 10% flower
  stage.
           In another embodiment, the glyphosate treatment is applied from about Canola
  growth stage 60 to about 80 on the BBCH scale.
           An aspect of the disclosure features a method of reducing weed matter during
  harvest of brassica seeds of a glyphosate-tolerant brassica population in a field. The method
  comprises applying a glyphosate treatment to the brassica population in the field, wherein
  the field has one or more weeds selected from the group consisting of thistle and pigweed,
  and wherein the brassica population is beyond the 6-leaf stage and the brassica population
  does not express an insensitive EPSPS; and controlling the growth of weed prior to harvest
  such that the weed mater is reduced at harvest.
           An aspect of the disclosure features a method of late season weed control in a field
  having brassica crop without adversely affecting the yield. The method comprises planting
  a population of brassica plants that are tolerant to glyphosate wherein the plants express a
  glyphosate metabolizing enzyme such that the expression of the enzyme results in effective
  glyphosate tolerance; applying an effective amount of glyphosate to the brassica plants
  wherein a substantial portion of the brassica plants are beyond the 6-leaf stage and wherein
  the glyphosate application does not result in significant chlorosis; and controlling the
  growth of weeds in the field and wherein the brassica crop yield is not reduced by more
  than 5% compared to control brassica plants not expressing the glyphosate metabolizing
  enzyme.
           In an embodiment, the glyphosate treatment comprises 1350-2700 g ae/hectare of
  glyphosate and a substantial portion of the brassica plants are at about 10% flower stage.

  wherein the Canola plants metabolize glyphosate and do not express an insensitive EPSPS
  and wherein a substantial portion of the brassica plants are beyond the 6-leaf stage; and
  improving the Canola seed purity by controlling the growth of non-Canola species by the
  late-season application of glyphosate.
           Another aspect of the disclosure features a method of reducing harvest cost of
  brassica. The method comprises reducing the population of weeds in a brassica growing
  field by applying glyphosate to a population of glyphosate-tolerant brassica plants that
  exhibit at least 10% open flowers and harvesting the brassica crop, wherein the brassica
  plants express a glyphosate metabolizing enzyme.
           In an embodiment, the glyphosate application does not result in a significant
  chlorosis or necrosis of the brassica plants.
           In another embodiment, the glyphosate is inactivated within the brassica plants
  including the reproductive tissue.
           Another aspect of the disclosure features a method of controlling weeds in a brassica

0                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
          The present disclosure relates to methods of applying glyphosate to improve weed
  control in a field containing herbicide tolerant brassica species. In particular, glyphosate
  treatments are applied to a substantial portion of herbicide tolerant brassica plants which are
                                                  7

  beyond the 2-6 leaf stage such as for example to a substantial portion of herbicide tolerant
  brassica plants which are at the 10% open flowers to about 10% pod stage.
           The present disclosures now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference
  to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the disclosures
  are shown. Indeed, these disclosures may be embodied in many different forms and should
  not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments
  are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers
  refer to like elements throughout.
           Many modifications and other embodiments of the disclosures set forth herein will
  come to mind to one skilled in the art to which these disclosures pertain having the benefit
  of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings.
  Therefore, it is to be understood that the disclosures are not to be limited to the specific
  embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be
  included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed
  herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of
  limitation.
           Units, prefixes, and symbols are denoted in their International System of Units (SI)
  accepted form. Unless otherwise indicated, nucleic acids are written left to right in 5' to 3'
  orientation; and amino acid sequences are written left to right in amino to carboxy
  orientation. Numeric ranges recited within the specification are inclusive of the numbers
  defining the range and include each integer within the defined range. Nucleotides may be
  referred to herein by their one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUBMB
  Nomenclature Commission. The terms defined below are more fully defined by reference
  to the specification as a whole. Section headings provided throughout the specification are
5 provided for convenience and are not limitations to the various objects and embodiments of
  the present disclosure.
           The disclosure of each reference set forth herein is hereby incorporated by reference
  in its entirety.
           As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an", and "the"
0 include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example,
  reference to "a plant" includes a plurality of such plants, reference to "a cell" includes one
  or more cells and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.
           As used herein, the term "comprising" means "including but not limited to."
                                                  8

          As used herein, the term "Brassica" means any Brassicaplant and includes all plant
  varieties that can be bred with Brassica.
          As used herein, the term plant includes plant cells, plant organs, plant protoplasts,
  plant cell tissue cultures from which plants can be regenerated, plant calli, plant clumps and
  plant cells that are intact in plants or parts of plants such as embryos, pollen, ovules, seeds,
  leaves, flowers, branches, fruit, stalks, roots, root tips, anthers, and the like. Mature seed
  produced may be used for food, feed, fuel or other commercial or industrial purposes or for
  purposes of growing or reproducing the species.          Progeny, variants and mutants of the
  regenerated plants are also included within the scope of the disclosure.
          A transgenic "event" is produced by transformation             of plant cells with a
  heterologous DNA construct(s) including a nucleic acid expression cassette that comprises a
  transgene of interest, the regeneration of a population of plants from cells which each
  comprise the inserted transgene and selection of a particular plant characterized by insertion
  into a particular genome location.         An event is characterized phenotypically by the
  expression of the transgene(s). At the genetic level, an event is part of the genetic makeup
  of a plant. The term "event" also refers to progeny, produced by a sexual outcross between
  the transformant and another variety, that include the heterologous DNA.            Even after
  repeated back-crossing to a recurrent parent, the inserted DNA and flanking DNA from the
  transformed parent are present in the progeny of the cross at the same chromosomal
  location. The term "event" also refers to DNA from the original transformant comprising
  the inserted DNA and flanking sequence immediately adjacent to the inserted DNA that
  would be expected to be transferred to a progeny as the result of a sexual cross of one
  parental line that includes the inserted DNA (e.g., the original transformant and progeny
  resulting from selfing) and a parental line that does not contain the inserted DNA.
5         Transgenic events expressing GATI and GAT2 genes were tested herein. GATI, as
  mentioned herein is the Brassica GAT event DP-073496-4 (PCT International Patent
  Application No. PCT/US2010/05801 1, incorporated by reference).           GAT2, as mentioned
  herein is another transgenic Brassica line expressing a GAT variant.
           Unlike brassica plants expressing an insensitive EPSPS, GAT expressing brassica
0 plants are rendered tolerant to glyphosate herbicide by the action of the glyphosate acetyl
  transferase enzyme that inactivates or detoxifies glyphosate in a single enzymatic step.
  Enzymatic N-acetylation of glyphosate results in the glyphosate tolerance of brassica plants
  disclosed herein.
                                                   9

           Efficacy to glyphosate treatments with reduced/minimal discoloration chlorosiss) or
  necrosis at later reproductive stages (e.g., 10% open flowers) along with no significant
  reduction in seed yield of brassica is demonstrated herein.
           The term "germplasm" refers to an individual, a group of individuals or a clone
  representing a genotype, variety, species or culture or the genetic material thereof.
           The phrase "hybrid plants" refers to plants which result from a cross between
  genetically different individuals.
           Plant injury may be measured using several parameters such as necrosis percent
  injury, and/or chlorosis percent injury.
           Necrosis percent injury describes a visual rating based on the percentage of plants
  that have     brown or yellowing spots as a result of herbicide treatment, where 100%
  represents a completely dead plant, and 0% indicates that brown or yellowing spots were
  absent in treated plants.
           Chlorosis percent injury describes a visual rating of the percentage of the plant with
  a yellowing of the apical meristem, newest leaves or older leaves, where 100% denotes that
  all tissue is yellow, and 0% denotes the absence of yellowing tissue in plants treated with
  herbicide.
           Percentage of yield relative to 2X describes the yield obtained for the GAT events
  treated with respective glyphosate herbicide treatments compared to the same GAT events
  subjected to a solution containing 2X glyphosate treatment at the 3 to 5 leaf stage,
  expressed as a percentage of the 2X treatment at the 3 to 5 leaf stage.
           In an embodiment, glyphosate is inactivated by a glyphosate acetyl transferase
  enzyme within the brassica plants including the reproductive tissue such as open flowers
  and green buds.

  (Reglone@) that will accelerate seed drying and maturation.
           As used herein, the term "stacked" includes having multiple traits present in the
  same plant (i.e., both traits are incorporated into the nuclear genome, one trait is
  incorporated into the nuclear genome and one trait is incorporated into the genome of a
0 plastid, or both traits are incorporated into the genome of a plastid). In one non-limiting
  example, "stacked traits" comprise a molecular stack where the sequences are physically
  adjacent to each other. A trait, as used herein, refers to the phenotype derived from a
  particular sequence or groups of sequences. Co-transformation of genes can be carried out
                                                   10

  using single transformation vectors comprising multiple genes or genes carried separately
  on multiple vectors. If the sequences are stacked by genetically transforming the plants, the
  polynucleotide sequences of interest can be combined at any time and in any order. The
  traits can be introduced simultaneously in a co-transformation protocol with the
  polynucleotides of interest provided by any combination of transformation cassettes. For
  example, if two sequences will be introduced, the two sequences can be contained in
  separate transformation cassettes (trans) or contained on the same transformation cassette
  (cis). Expression of the sequences can be driven by the same promoter or by different
  promoters. In certain cases, it may be desirable to introduce a transformation cassette that
  will suppress the expression of the polynucleotide of interest. This may be combined with
  any combination of other suppression cassettes or overexpression cassettes to generate the
  desired combination of traits in the plant. It is further recognized that polynucleotide
  sequences can be stacked at a desired genomic location using a site-specific recombination
  system. See, for example, International Publication Numbers WO 1999/25821, WO
  1999/25854, WO 1999/25840, WO 1999/25855 and WO 1999/25853, the disclosures of
  each of which are herein incorporated by reference.
           In one embodiment, the herbicide tolerant brassica species may comprise the
  brassica GATI event. The polynucleotides conferring the GATI event may be engineered
  into a molecular stack.          The molecular stack may comprise at least one additional
  polynucleotide that confers tolerance to a second herbicide.         The sequence may confer
  tolerance to glufosinate, and may comprise a pat gene. The additional polynucleotide may
  provide tolerance to ALS-inhibitor herbicides. The additional polynucleotide may provide
  tolerance to dicamba or auxin herbicides.
           In other embodiments, the herbicide tolerant brassica species of the disclosure may
5 comprise one or more traits of interest, and in more specific embodiments, the plant may be
  stacked with any combination of polynucleotide sequences of interest in order to create
  plants with a desired combination of traits.
           A trait, as used herein, refers to the phenotype derived from a particular sequence or
  groups of sequences.       For example, herbicide-tolerance polynucleotides may be stacked
0 with any other polynucleotides encoding polypeptides having pesticidal and/or insecticidal
  activity, such as Bacillus thuringiensis toxic proteins (described in US Patent Numbers

          Transgenes useful for preparing transgenic plants include, but are not limited to, the
  following:
           1.      Transgenes Conferring Resistance to Insects or Disease:
           (A) Plant disease resistance genes. Plant defenses are often activated by specific
  interaction between the product of a disease resistance gene (R) in the plant and the product
  of a corresponding avirulence (Avr) gene in the pathogen. A plant variety can be
  transformed with cloned resistance gene to engineer plants that are resistant to specific
  pathogen strains. See, for example, Jones, et al., (1994) Science 266:789 (cloning of the
  tomato Cf-9 gene for resistance to Cladosporiumfulvum); Martin, et al., (1993) Science
  262:1432 (tomato Pto gene for resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato encodes a
  protein kinase); Mindrinos, et al., (1994) Cell 78:1089 (ArabidopsisRSP2 gene for
  resistance to Pseudomonas syringae), McDowell and Woffenden, (2003) Trends
  Biotechnol. 21(4):178-83 and Toyoda, et al., (2002) TransgenicRes. 11(6):567-82. A plant
  resistant to a disease is one that is more resistant to a pathogen as compared to the wild type
  plant.
           (B) Genes encoding a Bacillus thuringiensisprotein, a derivative thereof or a
  synthetic polypeptide modeled thereon. See, for example, Geiser, el al., (1986) Gene
  48:109, who disclose the cloning and nucleotide sequence of a Bt delta-endotoxin gene.
  Moreover, DNA molecules encoding delta-endotoxin genes can be purchased from
  American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.), for example, under ATCC Accession

                  One of ordinary skill in the art is familiar with protocols for simulating
  drought conditions and for evaluating drought tolerance of plants that have been subjected
  to simulated or naturally-occurring drought conditions. For example, one can simulate
  drought conditions by giving plants less water than normally required or no water over a
  period of time, and one can evaluate drought tolerance by looking for differences in
  physiological and/or physical condition, including (but not limited to) vigor, growth, size,
  or root length, or in particular, leaf color or leaf area size. Other techniques for evaluating
  drought tolerance include measuring chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic rates and gas
  exchange rates.
          A drought stress experiment may involve a chronic stress (i.e., slow dry down)
  and/or may involve two acute stresses (i.e., abrupt removal of water) separated by a day or
  two of recovery.
  Herbicide Tolerance Traits
          The brassica species of the disclosure may be stacked with, for example,
  hydroxyphenylpyruvatedioxygenases which are enzymes that catalyze the reaction in which
  para-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) is transformed into homogentisate. Molecules which
  inhibit this enzyme and which bind to the enzyme in order to inhibit transformation of the
  HPP into homogentisate are useful as herbicides. Traits conferring tolerance to such
  herbicides in plants are described in US Patent Numbers 6,245,968 B1; 6,268,549 and
  6,069,115 and International Publication Number WO 99/23886. Other examples of suitable
  herbicide-tolerance traits that could be stacked with an event of the disclosure include
  aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenase polynucleotides (which reportedly confer tolerance to 2,4-D
  and other phenoxy auxin herbicides as well as to aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides as
5 described, for example, in International Publication WO 05/107437) and dicamba-tolerance
  polynucleotides as described, for example, in Herman, et al., (2005) J. Biol. Chemn.
  280:24759-24767.
          Other examples of herbicide-tolerance traits that could be stacked include those
  conferred by polynucleotides encoding an exogenous phosphinothricin acetyltransferase, as
0 described in US Patent Numbers 5,969,213; 5,489,520; 5,550,318; 5,874,265; 5,919,675;
  5,561,236; 5,648,477; 5,646,024; 6,177,616 and 5,879,903. Plants containing an exogenous
  phosphinothricin acetyltransferase can exhibit improved tolerance to glufosinate herbicides,
  which inhibit the enzyme glutamine synthase. Other examples of herbicide-tolerance traits
                                                    25

  that could be combined with an event disclosed herein include those conferred by
  polynucleotides conferring altered protoporphyrinogen oxidase (protox) activity, as
  described in US Patent Numbers 6,288,306 B1; 6,282,837 BI and 5,767,373 and
  International Publication Number WO 01/12825. Plants containing such polynucleotides
  can exhibit improved tolerance to any of a variety of herbicides which target the protox
  enzyme (also referred to as "protox inhibitors").
          ALS inhibitor-tolerant traits may be stacked with the plants disclosed herein. As
  used herein, an "ALS inhibitor-tolerant polypeptide" comprises any polypeptide which
  when expressed in a plant confers tolerance to at least one ALS inhibitor. A variety of ALS
  inhibitors are known and include, for example, sulfonylurea, imidazolinone,
  triazolopyrimidines, pryimidinyoxy(thio)benzoates, and/or
  sulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinone herbicide. Additional ALS inhibitors are known and are
  disclosed elsewhere herein. It is known in the art that ALS mutations fall into different
  classes with regard to tolerance to sulfonylureas, imidazolinones, triazolopyrimidines, and
  pyrimidinyl(thio)benzoates, including mutations having the following characteristics: (1)
  broad tolerance to all four of these groups; (2) tolerance to imidazolinones and
  pyrimidinyl(thio)benzoates; (3) tolerance to sulfonylureas and triazolopyrimidines; and (4)
  tolerance to sulfonylureas and imidazolinones.
          Various ALS inhibitor-tolerant polypeptides can be employed. The ALS inhibitor
  tolerant polynucleotides contain at least one nucleotide mutation resulting in one amino acid
  change in the ALS polypeptide. The change occurs in one of seven substantially conserved
  regions of acetolactate synthase. See, for example, Hattori et al. (1995) Molecular Genetics
  and Genomes 246:419-425; Lee et al. (1998) EMBO Journal7:1241-1248; Mazur et al.
  (1989) Ann. Rev. Plant Phys. 40:441-470; and U.S. Patent No. 5,605,011, each of which is
5 incorporated by reference in their entirety. The ALS inhibitor-tolerant polypeptide can be
  encoded by, for example, the SuRA or SuRB locus of ALS. In specific embodiments, the
  ALS inhibitor-tolerant polypeptide comprises the C3 ALS mutant, the HRA ALS mutant,
  the S4 mutant or the S4/HRA mutant or any combination thereof. Different mutations in
  ALS are known to confer tolerance to different herbicides and groups (and/or subgroups) of
0 herbicides; see, e.g., Tranel and Wright (2002) Weed Science 50:700-712. See also, U.S.
  Patent No. 5,605,011, 5,378,824, 5,141,870, and 5,013,659, each of which is herein
  incorporated by reference in their entirety. See also, SEQ ID NO:65 comprising a soybean
  HRA sequence; SEQ ID NO:66 comprising a maize HRA sequence; SEQ ID NO:67
                                                 26

  comprising an Arabidopsis HRA sequence; and SEQ ID NO:86 comprising an HRA
  sequence used in cotton. The HRA mutation in ALS finds particular use. The mutation
  results in the production of an acetolactate synthase polypeptide which is resistant to at least
  one ALS inhibitor chemistry in comparison to the wild-type protein. For example, a plant
  expressing an ALS inhibitor-tolerant polypeptide may be tolerant of a dose of sulfonylurea,
  imidazolinone, triazolopyrimidines, pryimidinyloxy(thio)benzoates, and/or
  sulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinone herbicide that is at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20,
  25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 70, 80, 100, 125, 150, 200, 500, or 1000 times higher than a dose of the
  herbicide that would cause damage to an appropriate control plant. The ALS inhibitor
  tolerant polypeptide comprises a number of mutations. Additionally, plants having an ALS
  inhibitor polypeptide can be generated through the selection of naturally occurring
  mutations that impart tolerance to glyphosate.
          The ALS inhibitor-tolerant polypeptide may confer tolerance to sulfonylurea and
  imidazolinone herbicides. Sulfonylurea and imidazolinone herbicides inhibit growth of
  higher plants by blocking acetolactate synthase (ALS), also known as, acetohydroxy acid
  synthase (AHAS). For example, plants containing particular mutations in ALS (e.g., the S4
  and/or HRA mutations) are tolerant to sulfonylurea herbicides. The production of
  sulfonylurea-tolerant plants and imidazolinone-tolerant plants is described more fully in
  U.S. Patent Nos. 5,605,011; 5,013,659; 5,141,870; 5,767,361; 5,731,180; 5,304,732;
  4,761,373; 5,331,107; 5,928,937; and 5,378,824; and international publication WO
  96/33270, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties for all purposes.
  The ALS inhibitor-tolerant polypeptide may comprise a sulfonamide-tolerant acetolactate
  synthase (otherwise known as a sulfonamide-tolerant acetohydroxy acid synthase) or an
  imidazolinone-tolerant acetolactate synthase (otherwise known as an imidazolinone-tolerant
5 acetohydroxy acid synthase).
          The glyphosate tolerant brassica plants express a glyphosate acetyl transferase
  (GAT) enzyme that may be combined, or stacked, with an EPSPS enzyme.
          Other examples of herbicide-tolerance traits that could be combined in the brassica
  tolerant species disclosed herein include those conferring tolerance to at least one herbicide
0 in a plant such as, for example, a brassica plant or horseweed. Herbicide-tolerant weeds are
  known in the art, as are plants that vary in their tolerance to particular herbicides. See, e.g.,
  Green and Williams, (2004) "Correlation of Corn (Zea mays) Inbred Response to
  Nicosulfuron and Mesotrione," poster presented at the WSSA Annual Meeting in Kansas

  and Ulrich, (1993) Weed Science 41:508-516. The trait(s) responsible for these tolerances
  can be combined by breeding or via other methods with an event disclosed herein to provide
  a plant of the disclosure as well as methods of use thereof.
           A brassica tolerant species disclosed herein can contain at least one other trait to
  which results in a variety of desired trait combinations including, but not limited to, traits
  desirable for animal feed such as high oil content (e.g., US Patent Number 6,232,529);
  balanced amino acid content (e.g., hordothionins (US Patent Numbers 5,990,389;
  5,885,801; 5,885,802 and 5,703,409; US Patent Number 5,850,016); barley high lysine
  (Williamson, et al., (1987) Eur. J. Biochen. 165:99-106 and WO 98/20122) and high
  methionine proteins (Pedersen, et al., (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261:6279; Kirihara, et al.,
  (1988) Gene 71:359 and Musumura, et al., (1989) Plant Mol. Biol. 12:123)); increased
  digestibility (e.g., modified storage proteins (US Patent Application Serial Number
  10/053,410, filed November 7, 2001) and thioredoxins (US Application Serial Number
  10/005,429, filed December 3, 2001)); the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by
  reference. Desired trait combinations also include LLNC (low linolenic acid content; see,
  e.g., Dyer, et al., (2002) Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 59:224-230) and OLCH (high oleic
  acid content; see, e.g., Fernandez-Moya, et al., (2005) J. Agric. Food Chem. 53:5326-5330).
           A brassica tolerant species disclosed herein can additionally contain other desirable
  traits such as, for example, fumonisin detoxification genes (US Patent Number 5,792,931),
  avirulence and disease resistance genes (Jones, et al., (1994) Science 266:789; Martin, et
  al., (1993) Science 262:1432; Mindrinos, et al., (1994) Cell 78:1089) and traits desirable for
  processing or process products such as modified oils (e.g., fatty acid desaturase genes (US
  Patent Number 5,952,544; WO 94/11516)); modified starches (e.g., ADPG
5 pyrophosphorylases (AGPase), starch synthases (SS), starch branching enzymes (SBE), and
  starch debranching enzymes (SDBE)) and polymers or bioplastics (e.g., US Patent Number
  5,602,321; beta-ketothiolase, polyhydroxybutyrate synthase, and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase
  (Schubert, et al., (1988) J. Bacteriol. 170:5837-5847) facilitate expression of
  polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)); the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by
0 reference. One could also combine herbicide-tolerant polynucleotides with polynucleotides
  providing agronomic traits such as male sterility (e.g., see, US Patent Number 5.583,210),
  stalk strength, flowering time or transformation technology traits such as cell cycle
                                                  28

  regulation or gene targeting (e.g., WO 99/61619, WO 00/17364 and WO 99/25821), the
  disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.
           These stacked combinations can be created by any method including, but not limited
  to, breeding plants by any conventional methodology or genetic transformation. If the
  sequences are stacked by genetically transforming the plants, the polynucleotide sequences
  of interest can be combined at any time and in any order. The traits can be introduced
  simultaneously in a co-transformation protocol with the polynucleotides of interest provided
  by any combination of transformation cassettes. For example, if two sequences will be
  introduced, the two sequences can be contained in separate transformation cassettes (trans)
  or contained on the same transformation cassette (cis). Expression of the sequences can be
  driven by the same promoter or by different promoters. In certain cases, it may be desirable
  to introduce a transformation cassette that will suppress the expression of the
  polynucleotide of interest. This may be combined with any combination of other
  suppression cassettes or overexpression cassettes to generate the desired combination of
  traits in the plant. It is further recognized that polynucleotide sequences can be stacked at a
  desired genomic location using a site-specific recombination system. See, for example,
  W099/25821, W099/25854, W099/25840, W099/25855 and W099/25853, all of which
  are herein incorporated by reference.
           It is to be understood that as used herein the term "transgenic" includes any cell, cell
  line, callus, tissue, plant part or plant, the genotype of which has been altered by the
  presence of a heterologous nucleic acid including those transgenics initially so altered as
  well as those created by sexual crosses or asexual propagation from the initial transgenic.
  The term "transgenic" as used herein does not encompass the alteration of the genome
  (chromosomal or extra-chromosomal) by conventional plant breeding methods or by
5 naturally occurring events such as random cross-fertilization, non-recombinant viral
  infection, non-recombinant bacterial transformation, non-recombinant transposition or
  spontaneous mutation.
           "Transformation" refers to the transfer of a nucleic acid fragment into the genome of
  a host organism, resulting in genetically stable inheritance. Host organisms containing the
0 transformed nucleic acid fragments are referred to as "transgenic" organisms. Examples of
  methods of plant transformation include Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (De
  Blaere, et al., (1987) Meth. Enzymol. 143:277) and particle-accelerated or "gene gun"
  transformation technology (Klein, et al., (1987) Nature (London) 327:70-73; US Patent
                                                    29

  Number 4,945,050, incorporated herein by reference). Additional transformation methods
  are disclosed below.
          The present disclosure provides methods for controlling weeds in an area of
  cultivation, preventing the development or the appearance of herbicide resistant weeds in an
  area of cultivation, producing a crop and increasing crop safety. The term "controlling,"
  and derivations thereof, for example, as in "controlling weeds" refers to one or more of
  inhibiting the growth, germination, reproduction and/or proliferation of and/or killing,
  removing, destroying or otherwise diminishing the occurrence and/or activity of a weed.
          As used herein, an "area of cultivation" comprises any region in which one desires
  to grow a plant. Such areas of cultivations include, but are not limited to, a field in which a
  plant is cultivated (such as a crop field, a sod field, a tree field, a managed forest, a field for
  culturing fruits and vegetables, etc), a greenhouse, a growth chamber, etc.
          Unless specified otherwise, for example in a particular experiment, a "control" or
  "control plant" or "control plant cell" provides a reference point for measuring changes in
  phenotype of the subject plant or plant cell, and may be any suitable plant or plant cell. A
  control plant or plant cell may comprise, for example: (a) a wild-type plant or cell, i.e., of
  the same genotype as the starting material for the genetic alteration which resulted in the
  subject plant or cell; (b) a plant or plant cell of the same genotype as the starting material
  but which has been transformed with a null construct (i.e., with a construct which has no
  known effect on the trait of interest, such as a construct comprising a marker gene); (c) a
  plant or plant cell which is a non-transformed segregant among progeny of a subject plant
  or plant cell; (d) a plant or plant cell which is genetically identical to the subject plant or
  plant cell but which is not exposed to the same treatment (e.g., herbicide treatment) as the
  subject plant or plant cell; (e) the subject plant or plant cell itself, under conditions in which
5 the gene of interest is not expressed or (f) the subject plant or plant cell itself, under
  conditions in which it has not been exposed to a particular treatment such as, for example, a
  herbicide or combination of herbicides and/or other chemicals. In some instances, an
  appropriate control plant or control plant cell may have a different genotype from the
  subject plant or plant cell but may share the herbicide-sensitive characteristics of the
0 starting material for the genetic alteration(s) which resulted in the subject plant or cell (see,
  e.g., Green, (1998) Weed Technology 12:474-477; Green and Ulrich, (1993) Weed Science
  41:508-516. In other embodiments, the null segregant can be used as a control, as they are
  genetically identical to DP-073496-4 with the exception of the transgenic insert DNA.
                                                   30

      Classification of herbicides (i.e.. the grouping of herbicides into classes and subclasses)
  is well-known in the art and includes classifications by HRAC (Herbicide Resistance
  Action Committee) and WSSA (the Weed Science Society of America) (see also, Retzinger
  and Mallory-Smith, (1997) Weed Technology 11:384-393). An abbreviated version of the
  HRAC classification (with notes regarding the corresponding WSSA group) can be found in
  Table I of PCT International Patent Application No. PCT/US2010/058011 (herein
  incorporated by reference).
           Herbicides can be classified by their mode of action and/or site of action and can
  also be classified by the time at which they are applied (e.g., preemergent or postemergent),
  by the method of application (e.g., foliar application or soil application) or by how they are
  taken up by or affect the plant. For example, thifensulfuron-methyl and tribenuron-methyl
  are applied to the foliage of a crop and are generally metabolized there, while rimsulfuron
  and chlorimuron-ethyl are generally taken up through both the roots and foliage of a plant.
  "Mode of action" generally refers to the metabolic or physiological process within the plant
  that the herbicide inhibits or otherwise impairs, whereas "site of action" generally refers to
  the physical location or biochemical site within the plant where the herbicide acts or
  directly interacts. Herbicides can be classified in various ways, including by mode of action
  and/or site of action.
           Often, a herbicide-tolerance gene that confers tolerance to a particular herbicide or
  other chemical on a plant expressing it will also confer tolerance to other herbicides or
  chemicals in the same class or subclass, for example, a class or subclass as set forth in the
  abbreviated version of the HRAC herbicide classification system (see Table 1; PCT
  International Patent Application No. PCT/US2010/05801 1, herein incorporated by
  reference).
5          In certain methods, glyphosate, alone or in combination with another herbicide of
  interest, can be applied to the Brassicaplants or their area of cultivation. Non-limiting
  examples of glyphosate formulations are set forth in Table 1.

             Other suitable herbicides and agricultural chemicals are known in the art, such as,
  for example, those described in WO 2005/041654. Other herbicides also include
5 bioherbicides such as Alternaria destruens Simmons, Colletotrichum gloeosporiodes
  (Penz.) Penz. and Sacc., Drechsieramonoceras (MTB-95 1), Myrothecium verrucaria
  (Albertini & Schweinitz) Ditmar: Fries, Phytophthorapalmivora (Butl.) Butl. and Puccinia
  thlaspeos Schub. Combinations of various herbicides can result in a greater-than-additive
  (i.e., synergistic) effect on weeds and/or a less-than-additive effect (i.e., safening) on crops
0 or other desirable plants. In certain instances, combinations of glyphosate with other
                                                            32

   herbicides having a similar spectrum of control but a different mode of action will be
   particularly advantageous for preventing the development of resistant weeds.
           The methods further comprise applying to the crop and the weeds in a field a
   sufficient amount of at least one herbicide to which the crop seeds or plants are tolerant,
   such as, for example, glyphosate, a hydroxyphenylpyruvatedioxygenase inhibitor (e.g.,
   mesotrione or sulcotrione), a phytoene desaturase inhibitor (e.g., diflufenican), a pigment
   synthesis inhibitor, sulfonamide, imidazolinone, bialaphos, phosphinothricin, azafenidin,
   butafenacil, sulfosate, glufosinate, triazolopyrimidine, pyrimidinyloxy(thio)benzoate or
   sulonylaminocarbonyltriazolinone, an acetyl Co-A carboxylase inhibitor such as
   quizalofop-P-ethyl, a synthetic auxin such as quinclorac., KIH-485 or a protox inhibitor to
   control the weeds without significantly damaging the crop plants.
           Generally, the effective amount of herbicide applied to the field is sufficient to
   selectively control the weeds without significantly affecting the crop. "Weed" as used
   herein refers to a plant which is not desirable in a particular area. Conversely, a "crop
   plant" as used herein refers to a plant which is desired in a particular area, such as, for
   example, a Brassica plant. Thus, in some embodiments, a weed is a non-crop plant or a
   non-crop species. Weeds can be classified into two major groups: monocots and dicots.
           Many plant species can be controlled (i.e., killed or damaged) by the herbicides
   described herein. Accordingly, the methods of the disclosure are useful in controlling these
   plant species where they are undesirable (i.e., where they are weeds). These plant species
   include crop plants as well as species commonly considered weeds, including but not
   limited to species such as: blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides), giant foxtail (Setaria
  faberi), large crabgrass (Digitariasanguinalis), Surinam grass (Brachiaria decumbens),
   wild oat (Avenafatua), common cocklebur (Xanthiun pensylvanicum), common
5  lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), morning glory (Ipomoea coccinea), pigweed

  plantain (Plantagolanceolata), tropical spiderwort (Cominmelina benghalensis), field
  bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus), redvine (Brunnichia
  ovata), hemp sesbania (Sesbania exaltata), sicklepod (Senna obtusifblia), Texas blueweed
  (Helianthusciliaris)and Devil's claws (Proboscidealouisianica). In other embodiments,
  the weed comprises an herbicide-resistant ryegrass, for example, a glyphosate resistant
  ryegrass, a paraquat resistant ryegrass, a ACCase-inhibitor resistant ryegrass and a non
  selective herbicide resistant ryegrass. In some embodiments, the undesired plants are
  proximate the crop plants.
           In some embodiments, a Brassica plant of the disclosure is not significantly
  damaged by treatment with glyphosate applied to that plant at a dose equivalent to a rate of
  at least 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60,

  ounce = 29.57ml) of active ingredient or commercial product or herbicide formulation per
  acre or per hectare, whereas an appropriate control plant is significantly damaged by the
  same treatment.
           In an embodiment, the glyphosate tolerant brassica is at a growth stage that is
  beyond the 6-leaf stage. In an embodiment, the glyphosate tolerant brassica is at a growth
  stage of first flower (BBCH 60). In an embodiment, the glyphosate tolerant brassica is at a

0         In some embodiments of the disclosure, glyphosate is applied to an area of
  cultivation and/or to at least one plant in an area of cultivation at rates between 8 and 32
  ounces of acid equivalent per acre, or at rates between 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28
  and 30 ounces of acid equivalent per acre at the lower end of the range of application and
                                                  35

  between 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26. 28, 30 and 32 ounces of acid equivalent per acre at
  the higher end of the range of application (1 ounce = 29.57 ml). In other embodiments,
  glyphosate is applied at least at 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or greater ounce of
  active ingredient per hectare (1 ounce = 29.57 ml). In some embodiments of the disclosure,
  a sulfonylurea herbicide is applied to a field and/or to at least one plant in a field at rates
  between 0.04 and 1.0 ounces of active ingredient per acre, or at rates between 0.1, 0.2, 0.4,
  0.6 and 0.8 ounces of active ingredient per acre at the lower end of the range of application
  and between 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 ounces of active ingredient per acre at the higher end
  of the range of application. (1 ounce = 29.57 ml). In some embodiments, as described
  herein, glyphosate treatment can be made at late stage canola development when needed for
  weed control.
          As is known in the art, glyphosate herbicides as a class contain the same active
  ingredient, but the active ingredient is present as one of a number of different salts and/or
  formulations. However, herbicides known to inhibit ALS vary in their active ingredient as
  well as their chemical formulations. One of skill in the art is familiar with the
  determination of the amount of active ingredient and/or acid equivalent present in a
  particular volume and/or weight of herbicide preparation.
          An ALS inhibitor herbicide is employed. Rates at which the ALS inhibitor
  herbicide is applied to the crop, crop part, seed or area of cultivation can be any of the rates
  disclosed herein. In specific embodiments, the rate for the ALS inhibitor herbicide is about
  0.1 to about 5000 g ai/hectare, about 0.5 to about 300 g ai/hectare or about 1 to about 150 g
  ai/hectare.
          Generally, a particular herbicide is applied to a particular field (and any plants
  growing in it) no more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 times a year, or no more than 1, 2, 3, 4 or
5 5 times per growing season.
          By "treated with a combination of' or "applying a combination of' herbicides to a
  crop, area of cultivation or field" it is intended that a particular field, crop or weed is treated
  with each of the herbicides and/or chemicals indicated to be part of the combination so that
  a desired effect is achieved, i.e., so that weeds are selectively controlled while the crop is
0 not significantly damaged. In some embodiments, weeds which are susceptible to each of
  the herbicides exhibit damage from treatment with each of the herbicides which is additive
  or synergistic. The application of each herbicide and/or chemical may be simultaneous or
                                                   36

  the applications may be at different times, so long as the desired effect is achieved.
  Furthermore, the application can occur prior to the planting of the crop.
            An "additive herbicidal composition" has an herbicidal activity that is about equal to
  the observed activities of the individual components. A "synergistic herbicidal
  combination" has an herbicidal activity higher than what can be expected based on the
  observed activities of the individual components when used alone. Accordingly, the
  presently disclosed subject matter provides a synergistic herbicide combination, wherein the
  degree of weed control of the mixture exceeds the sum of control of the individual
  herbicides. In some embodiments, the degree of weed control of the mixture exceeds the
  sum of control of the individual herbicides by any statistically significant amount including,
  for example, about 1% to 5%, about 5% to about 10%, about 10% to about 20%, about 20%
  to about 30%, about 30% to 40%, about 40% to about 50%, about 50% to about 60%, about
  60% to about 70%, about 70% to about 80%, about 80% to about 90%, about 90% to about
  100%, about 100% to 120% or greater. Further, a "synergistically effective amount" of an
  herbicide refers to the amount of one herbicide necessary to elicit a synergistic effect in
  another herbicide present in the herbicide composition. Thus, the term "synergist," and
  derivations thereof, refer to a substance that enhances the activity of an active ingredient
  (ai), i.e., a substance in a formulation from which a biological effect is obtained, for
  example, an herbicide.
            For controlling undesired plants, glyphosate may be applied pre-emergence, post
  emergence or pre- and post-emergence to the undesired plants or plant crops and/or the
  ALS inhibitor herbicide (i.e., the sulfonylurea herbicide) is applied pre-emergence, post
  emergence or pre- and post-emergence to the undesired plants or plant crops. In other
  embodiments, the glyphosate and/or the ALS inhibitor herbicide (i.e., the sulfonylurea
5 herbicide) are applied together or are applied separately. In yet other embodiments, the
  synergistic herbicide composition is applied, e.g., step (b) above, at least once prior to
  planting the crop(s) of interest, e.g., step (a) above.
            Weeds that can be difficult to control with glyphosate alone in fields where a crop is
  grown (such as, for example, a brassica crop) include but are not limited to the following:
0 horseweed (e.g., Conyza canadensis);rigid ryegrass (e.g., Lolium rigidum); goosegrass
  (e.g., Eleusine indica); Italian ryegrass (e.g., Lolium multiflorum); hairy fleabane (e.g.,
  Conyza bonariensis); buckhorn plantain (e.g., Plantagolanceolata); common ragweed (e.g.,
  Ambrosia artemisifblia);morning glory (e.g., Ipomoea spp.); waterhemp (e.g., Amaranthus
                                                   37

  spp.); field bindweed (e.g., Convolvulus arvensis); yellow nutsedge (e.g., Cyperus
  esculentus); common lambsquarters (e.g., Chenopodium album); wild buckwheat (e.g.,
  Polygonium convolvulus); velvetleaf (e.g., Abutilon theophrasti);kochia (e.g., Kochia
  scoparia)and Asiatic dayflower (e.g., Commelina spp.). In areas where such weeds are
  found, Brassica plants tolerance to another herbicide are particularly useful in allowing the
  treatment of a field (and therefore any crop growing in the field) with combinations of
  herbicides that would cause unacceptable damage to crop plants that did not contain both of
  these polynucleotides. Plants of the disclosure that are tolerant to glyphosate and other
  herbicides such as, for example, sulfonylurea, imidazolinone, triazolopyrimidine,
  pyrimidinyl(thio)benzoate and/or sulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinone herbicides in addition
  to being tolerant to at least one other herbicide with a different mode of action or site of
  action are particularly useful in situations where weeds are tolerant to at least two of the
  same herbicides to which the plants are tolerant. In this manner, plants of the disclosure
  make possible improved control of weeds that are tolerant to more than one herbicide.
           Other commonly used treatments for weed control in fields where current
  commercial varieties of crops (including, for example, Brassicas)are grown include the
  sulfonylurea herbicide thifensulfuron-methyl (available commercially as Harmony GT@).
  However, one disadvantage of thifensulfuron-methyl is that the higher application rates
  required for consistent weed control often cause injury to a crop growing in the same field.
  Brassicaplants comprising additional tolerance (in addition to glyphosate) can be treated
  with a combination of glyphosate and thifensulfuron-methyl, which has the advantage of
  using herbicides with different modes of action. Thus, weeds that are resistant to either
  herbicide alone are controlled by the combination of the two herbicides, and the improved
  GAT I Brassicaplants would not be significantly damaged by the treatment.
5          Other herbicides which are used for weed control in fields where current
  commercial varieties of crops (including, for example, Brassicas)are grown are the
  triazolopyrimidine herbicide cloransulam-methyl (available commercially as FirstRate)
  and the imidazolinone herbicide imazaquin (available commercially as Sceptor@). When
  these herbicides are used individually they may provide only marginal control of weeds.
0 However, commercial varieties of crops may be treated, for example, with a combination of
  glyphosate (e.g., Roundup@ (glyphosate isopropylamine salt)), imazapyr (currently
  available commercially as Arsenal@), chlorimuron-ethyl (currently available commercially
  as Classic@), quizalofop-P-ethyl (currently available commercially as Assure lI@) and
                                                  38

  fomesafen (currently available commercially as Flexstar@). This combination has the
  advantage of using herbicides with different modes of action. Thus, weeds that are tolerant
  to just one or several of these herbicides are controlled by the combination of the five
  herbicides. This combination provides an extremely broad spectrum of protection against
  the type of herbicide-tolerant weeds that might be expected to arise and spread under
  current weed control practices.
           Fields containing the glyphosate-metabolizing tolerant Brassica plants with
  additional herbicide tolerance may also be treated., for example, with a combination of
  herbicides including glyphosate, rimsulfuron, and dicamba or mesotrione. This
  combination may be particularly useful in controlling weeds which have developed some
  tolerance to herbicides which inhibit ALS. Another combination of herbicides which may
  be particularly useful for weed control includes glyphosate and at least one of the following:
  metsulfuron-methyl (commercially available as Ally@), imazapyr (commercially available
  as Arsenal@), imazethapyr, imazaquin and sulfentrazone. It is understood that any of the
  combinations discussed above or elsewhere herein may also be used to treat areas in
  combination with any other herbicide or agricultural chemical.
           Some commonly-used treatments for weed control in fields where current
  commercial crops (including, for example, Brassica) are grown include glyphosate
  (currently available commercially as Roundup), rimsulfuron (currently available
  commercially as Resolve@ or Matrix@), dicamba (commercially available as Clarity@),
  atrazine and mesotrione (commercially available as Callisto@). These herbicides are
  sometimes used individually due to poor crop tolerance to multiple herbicides.
  Unfortunately, when used individually, each of these herbicides has significant
  disadvantages. Particularly, the incidence of weeds that are tolerant to individual herbicides
  continues to increase, rendering glyphosate less effective than desired in some situations.
  Rimsulfuron provides better weed control at high doses which can cause injury to a crop,
  and alternatives such as dicamba are often more expensive than other commonly-used
  herbicides
           Some commonly-used treatments for weed control in fields where current
0 commercial crops are grown include glyphosate (currently available commercially as
  Roundup@), chlorimuron-ethyl, tribenuron-methyl, rimsulfuron (currently available
  commercially as Resolve@ or Matrix@), imazethapyr, imazapyr and imazaquin.
  Unfortunately, when used individually, each of these herbicides has significant
                                                 39

   disadvantages. Particularly, the incidence of weeds that are tolerant to individual herbicides
   continues to increase, rendering each individual herbicide less effective than desired in
   some situations. However, Brassica plants that are tolerant to glyphosate due to the
   expression of a glyphosate metabolizing enzyme such as GAT in combination with an
   additional herbicide tolerance trait can be treated with a combination of herbicides that
   would cause unacceptable damage to standard plant varieties, including combinations of
   herbicides that include at least one of those mentioned above.
            Various combinations of herbicides, fungicides, and/or insecticides may be applied
   with glyphosate through to the harvest stage of canola or at least until the 10% flower stage.
   These include herbicides, but are not limited, to Lontrel (active ingredient clopyralid),
   clethodim (currently available commercially as Select@, Centurion), Equinox@
   (Tepraloxydim), Muster@ (Ethametsulfuron Methyl), and Poast Ultra@ (Sethoxydim).
   These fungicides include, but are not limited to, Lance@ (boscalid), Proline@

            An herbicide may be formulated and applied to an area of interest such as, for
   example, a field or area of cultivation, in any suitable manner. An herbicide may be applied
   to a field in any form, such as, for example, in a liquid spray or as solid powder or granules.
   In specific embodiments, the herbicide or combination of herbicides that are employed in
5  the methods comprise a tankmix or a premix. An herbicide may also be formulated, for
   example, as a "homogenous granule blend" produced using blends technology (see, e.g., US
   Patent Number 6,022,552, entitled "Uniform Mixtures of Pesticide Granules"). The blends
   technology of US Patent Number 6,022,552 produces a nonsegregating blend (i.e., a
   "homogenous granule blend") of formulated crop protection chemicals in a dry granule
0  form that enables delivery of customized mixtures designed to solve specific problems. A
   homogenous granule blend can be shipped, handled, subsampled and applied in the same
   manner as traditional premix products where multiple active ingredients are formulated into
   the same granule.

           Any herbicide formulation applied over the GATI Brassicaplant can be prepared as
  a "tank-mix" composition. In such embodiments, each ingredient or a combination of
  ingredients can be stored separately from one another. The ingredients can then be mixed
  with one another prior to application. Typically, such mixing occurs shortly before
  application. In a tank-mix process, each ingredient, before mixing, typically is present in
  water or a suitable organic solvent. For additional guidance regarding the art of

           The methods of the disclosure further allow for the development of herbicide
  combinations to be used with the Brassica plants. In such methods, the environmental
  conditions in an area of cultivation are evaluated. Environmental conditions that can be
  evaluated include, but are not limited to, ground and surface water pollution concerns,
  intended use of the crop, crop tolerance, soil residuals, weeds present in area of cultivation,
  soil texture, pH of soil, amount of organic matter in soil, application equipment and tillage
  practices. Upon the evaluation of the environmental conditions, an effective amount of a
5 combination of herbicides can be applied to the crop, crop part, seed of the crop or area of
  cultivation.
           The herbicide applied to the Brassicaplants of the disclosure serves to prevent the
  initiation of growth of susceptible weeds and/or serve to cause damage to weeds that are
  growing in the area of interest. In some embodiments, the herbicide or herbicide mixture
0 exert these effects on weeds affecting crops that are subsequently planted in the area of
  interest (i.e., field or area of cultivation). In the methods of the disclosure, the application
  of the herbicide combination need not occur at the same time. So long as the field in which
  the crop is planted contains detectable amounts of the first herbicide and the second
                                                    41

  herbicide is applied at some time during the period in which the crop is in the area of
  cultivation, the crop is considered to have been treated with a mixture of herbicides
  according to the disclosure. Thus, methods of the disclosure encompass applications of
  herbicide which are "preemergent," "postemergent," "preplant incorporation" and/or which
  involve seed treatment prior to planting.
           "Preemergent" refers to an herbicide which is applied to an area of interest (e.g., a
  field or area of cultivation) before a plant emerges visibly from the soil. "Postemergent"
  refers to an herbicide which is applied to an area after a plant emerges visibly from the soil.
  In some instances, the terms "preemergent" and "postemergent" are used with reference to a
  weed in an area of interest, and in some instances these terms are used with reference to a
  crop plant in an area of interest. When used with reference to a weed, these terms may
  apply to only a particular type of weed or species of weed that is present or believed to be
  present in the area of interest. While any herbicide may be applied in a preemergent and/or
  postemergent treatment, some herbicides are known to be more effective in controlling a
  weed or weeds when applied either preemergence or postemergence. For example,
  rimsulfuron has both preemergence and postemergence activity, while other herbicides have
  predominately preemergence (metolachlor) or postemergence (glyphosate) activity. These
  properties of particular herbicides are known in the art and are readily determined by one of
  skill in the art. Further, one of skill in the art would readily be able to select appropriate
  herbicides and application times for use with the transgenic plants of the disclosure and/or
  on areas in which transgenic plants of the disclosure are to be planted. "Preplant
  incorporation" involves the incorporation of compounds into the soil prior to planting.
           Thus, the disclosure provides improved methods of growing a crop and/or
  controlling weeds.     The disclosure also provides methods of growing a crop and/or
5 controlling weeds which are "no-till" or "low-till" (also referred to as "reduced tillage"). In
  such methods, the soil is not cultivated or is cultivated less frequently during the growing
  cycle in comparison to traditional methods; these methods can save costs that would
  otherwise be incurred due to additional cultivation, including labor and fuel costs.
           The methods of the disclosure encompass the use of simultaneous and/or sequential
0 applications of multiple classes of herbicides. In some embodiments, the methods of the
  disclosure involve treating a plant of the disclosure and/or an area of interest (e.g., a field or
  area of cultivation) and/or weed with just one herbicide or other chemical such as, for
  example, a glyphosate herbicide.
                                                    42

           The time at which an herbicide is applied to an area of interest (and any plants
  therein) may be important in optimizing weed control. The time at which an herbicide is
  applied may be determined with reference to the size of plants and/or the stage of growth
  and/or development of plants in the area of interest, e.g., crop plants or weeds growing in
  the area. The stages of growth and/or development of plants are known in the art. Thus, for
  example, the time at which a herbicide or other chemical is applied to an area of interest in
  which plants are growing may be the time at which some or all of the plants in a particular
  area have reached at least a particular size and/or stage of growth and/or development, or
  the time at which some or all of the plants in a particular area have not yet reached a
  particular size and/or stage of growth and/or development.
           Different chemicals such as herbicides have different "residual" effects, i.e.,
  different amounts of time for which treatment with the chemical or herbicide continues to
  have an effect on plants growing in the treated area. Such effects may be desirable or
  undesirable, depending on the desired future purpose of the treated area (e.g., field or area
  of cultivation). Thus, a crop rotation scheme may be chosen based on residual effects from
  treatments that will be used for each crop and their effect on the crop that will subsequently
  be grown in the same area. One of skill in the art is familiar with techniques that can be
  used to evaluate the residual effect of an herbicide; for example, generally, glyphosate has
  very little or no soil residual activity, while herbicides that act to inhibit ALS vary in their
  residual activity levels. Residual activities for various herbicides are known in the art, and
  are also known to vary with various environmental factors such as, for example, soil
  moisture levels, temperature, pH and soil composition (texture and organic matter).
           Moreover, the transgenic plants of the disclosure may provide improved tolerance to
  treatment with additional chemicals commonly used on crops in conjunction with herbicide
5 treatments, such as safeners, adjuvants such as ammonium sulfonate and crop oil
  concentrate, and the like. The term "safener" refers to a substance that when added to an
  herbicide formulation eliminates or reduces the phytotoxic effects of the herbicide to certain
  crops. One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that the choice of safener depends,
  in part, on the crop plant of interest and the particular herbicide or combination of
0 herbicides included in the synergistic herbicide composition. Exemplary safeners suitable
  for use with the presently disclosed herbicide compositions include, but are not limited to,
  those disclosed in US Patent Numbers 4,808,208; 5,502,025; 6,124,240 and US Patent

  anhydride (1,8-naphthalic anhydride) and oxabetrinil to increase crop safety. Antidotally
  effective amounts of the herbicide safeners can be applied at the same time as the
  compounds of this disclosure, or applied as seed treatments. Therefore an aspect of the
  present disclosure relates to the use of a mixture comprising glyphosate, at least one other
  herbicide and an antidotally effective amount of an herbicide safener.
          As used herein, an "adjuvant" is any material added to a spray solution or
  formulation to modify the action of an agricultural chemical or the physical properties of
  the spray solution. See, for example, Green and Foy, (2003) "Adjuvants: Tools for
  Enhancing Herbicide Performance," in Weed Biology and Management, ed. Inderjit

5 CpGV. The weight ratios of these various mixing partners to other compositions (e.g.,
  herbicides) used in the methods of the disclosure typically are between 100:1 and 1:100, or
  between 30:1 and 1:30, between 10:1 and 1:10, or between 4:1 and 1:4.
           Thus, methods of the disclosure employ an herbicide or herbicide combination and
  may further comprise the use of insecticides and/or fungicides, and/or other agricultural
0 chemicals such as fertilizers. The use of such combined treatments of the disclosure can
  broaden the spectrum of activity against additional weed species and suppress the
  proliferation of any resistant biotypes.

  gibberellic acid, gibberellin A4 and A7 , harpin protein, mepiquat chloride, prohexadione
  calcium, prohydrojasmon, sodium nitrophenolate and trinexapac-methyl and plant growth
  modifying organisms such as Bacillus cereus strain BPO1.
           The methods described herein also provide a means of minimizing adverse
  agronomic impact as a result of late stage weed development. Controlling weeds that grow
  during late stage canola development may result in less stover, less biological matter, and
  better farming harvest operations which ultimately results in a positive agronomic impact
  for the grower. Diseases that may be increased by weed growth in the field during late
  stage canola growth include, but are not limited to, blackleg, fusarium wilt, and sclerotinia.
  By controlling weed growth at late stage canola development, canola diseases may be
  controlled better. Therefore, glyphosate treatment at late stage canola development may
  provide a means to better controlling canola disease.
  Canola Growth Stages
           A growth stage scale called the BBCH demical system may be used to classify the
  different stages of canola growth (Meler, U ed), Growth Stages of mono-and
  dicotyledonous plants, 2. Edition (2001) (Federal Biological Research Centre for
  Agriculture and Forestry,
  Berlin and Braunschweig;      Lancashire, P.D., H. Bleiholder, P. Langeluddecke, R. T. Van
  Den Boom, E. Weber und A. Witzen-Berger, An uniformdecimal code for growth stages of
  crops and weeds. Ann. appil. Biol. 119, 561-601). The BBCH scale for canola describes
  nine principal growth stages for canola and corresponding codes and descriptions. The
5 scale is divided into germination, leaf development, formation of side shoots, stem
  elongation, infloresence emergence, flowering, development of fruit, ripening, and
  senescence principal growth stages and further divided into subgroups. The BBCH growth
  stages are set forth in Table 2.

                                         EXPERIMENTAL
  Example 1. Herbicide Efficacy Trials for GAT Events for Determination of Yield
          Field trials were split plot designed with glyphosate treatments as the main factor
  and entries as the subplot. The split-plot design was used since more than one glyphosate
  treatment in each location was evaluated, where a different treatment to an individual plot
  was applied. In split-plot, the levels of the main-plot factor (glyphosate treatments) and the
  sub-plot factors (individual event entries) within the main-plots were randomized.
          The following treatments with glyphosate were used as detailed below at different
  growth stages. In these tests, IX glyphosate treatment was at 675 g ae/ha, 2X glyphosate
  treatment was at 1350 g ae/ha, 3X glyphosate treatment was at 2025 g ae/ha and 4X
  glyphosate treatment was at 2700 g ae/ha as active ingredient of glyphosate. All treatments
  were applied using a mechanical sprayer. For example, in Treatment 1 below, "2X
  cotyledon" describes a treatment of 1350 g ae/ha of glyphosate at the cotyledon growth
  stage. Various treatments were tested over a two year period and are described below.
  Treatments tested in Year 1:
           1. 2X cotyledon
          2.  2X 3-5 leaf stage
          3. 2X cot + 2X 3-5 leaf stage
          4. 2X cot + 2X bolting BBCH55
5         5. 4X cotyledon
          6. 4X 3-5 leaf stage
  Treatments tested in Year 2:

                                                 50

          To reduce the growth of weeds in the control plots, conventional herbicides or
  mechanical pulling of weeds were used as needed. There was no glyphosate applied to the
  control plots and was used as the control/base to which other glyphosate treatments were
  compared. The control plots may have had one or more weeds present during the growing
  season. Control is based on conventional herbicides that are registered for use in all canola.
          Plots were considered desiccated when 60-70% of the seed had turned from green to
  black colour. Combining occurred 5 - 14 days after desiccation depending on the weather
  conditions. Each plot was harvested individually. Moisture and weight were recorded
  directly on the combine. Yield was determined for the GATI event.
          Various locations were used in the test. Trials were evaluated across 10 locations in
  both Year 1 and Year 2. Locations included several sites in the short, mid, and long season
  zones across both years.
          The event that was tested was canola event DP-73496-4 (GATI) (PCT International
  Patent Application No. PCT/US2010/05801 1, incorporated by reference).
  Example 2. Herbicide Efficacy Trials for GAT Events for Determination of Chlorosis
          Field trials were split plot designed with glyphosate treatments as the main factor
  and entries as the subplot. Entries were randomized within the split factor, and the split was
  randomized within the replicate.
          The following treatments with glyphosate were used as detailed below at different
  growth stages. In these tests, IX glyphosate treatment was 675 g ae/ha, 2X glyphosate
  treatment was 1350 g ae/ha, 3X glyphosate treatment was 2025 g ae/ha and 4X glyphosate
  treatment was 2700 g ae/ha. All treatments were applied using a mechanical sprayer. For
5 example, in Treatment 1 below, "2X cotyledon" describes a treatment of 1350 g ae/ha of
  glyphosate at the cotyledon growth stage. Various treatments were tested over a two year
  period and are described below.
  Treatments tested in Year 1:
0                 1.   2X cotyledon
                 2.    2X 3-5 leaf stage

              6. 2X cotyledon + 2X 10 % flower BBCH61
          Control treatments were used as comparisions (see Example 1).
          The event that was tested was canola transformation event DP-73496-4 (GATI).
          Percent chlorosis was determined. Visual rating of chlorosis on plants was taken
  during the period indicated (i.e. 3-5 days) after spray application. Yellowing of the apical
  meristem, newest leaves or older leaves indicated herbicide-induced chlorotic injury.
  100%= all tissue is yellow, 0% = no signs of yellowing tissue.
  Indicators for chlorosis were as follows:
      HERBICIDE INJURY - CHLOROSIS (HINCL)
      3-5 DAY (HINCL_5) describes the visual rating of chlorosis 5 days after treatment.
      7-10 DAY (HINCL_10) describes the visual rating of chlorosis 10 days after treatment.
      14-21 DAY (HINCL_21) describes the visual rating of chlorosis 21 days after
      treatment.
      21-30 DAY (HINCL_30) describes the visual rating of chlorosis 30 days after
5     treatment.

  Example 3. Herbicide Efficacy Trials for GAT Events for Determination of Necrosis
          Field trials were split plot designed with glyphosate treatments as the main factor
0 and entries as the subplot. Entries were randomized within the split factor, and the split was
  randomized within the replicate.
          The following treatments with glyphosate were used as detailed below at different
  growth stages. In these tests, IX glyphosate treatment was 675 g ae/ha, 2X glyphosate
                                                 52

  treatment was 1350 g ae/ha, 3X glyphosate treatment was 2025 g ae/ha and 4X glyphosate
  treatment was 2700 g ae/ha. All treatments were applied using a mechanical sprayer. For
  example, in Treatment I below, "2X cotyledon" describes a treatment of 1350 g ae/ha of
  glyphosate at the cotyledon growth stage. Various treatments were tested over a two year
  period and are described below.
      Treatments tested in Year 1:
              1. 2X cotyledon
              2. 2X 3-5 leaf stage
              3. 2X cot + 2X 3-5 leaf stage

              6. 2X cotyledon + 2X 10 % flower BBCH61
          Conventional chemical treatments were used as one of the controls (see Example 1).
          Percentage necrosis was determined as follows. Visual rating of dead tissue on
  plants was taken during the period indicated (i.e. 3-5 days) after spray application. Brown or
5 yellowing spots are early signs of damage. Dry brown tissue is advanced damage. 100%
  completely dead plant, 0% = no signs of dying tissue.
  Indicators for necrosis were as follows:
      HERBICIDE CROP RESPONSE - NECROSIS (HINNE)
0     3-5 DAY (HINNE_5) describes a visual rating of necrosis 5 days after herbicide
      treatment.

      treatment.
      21-30 DAY (HINNE_30) describes a visual rating of necrosis 30 days after herbicide
      treatment.
      Rated 0 to 100%
      The event that was tested was canola transformation event DP-73496-4 (GATI).
  Example 4. Late Stage Application of Glyphosate on GAT Events
          Late stage glyphosate applications are applications of glyphosate at later growth
  stages than on the glyphosate label. One of the purposes of evaluating the GATI canola
  crop response beyond the current glyphosate label growth stage was to test whether any
  crop response observed for the herbicide treatments did not significantly impact yield
  compared to the control treatment. In Year 1, the expanded window application of
  glyphosate was 2X cot + 2X bolting BBCH55; a 2X treatment during the cotyledon stage
  and an additional 2X treatment during the plant growth stage where individual flower buds
  (main inflorescence) are visible but are still closed. In Year 2, 1X cotyledon, IX green bud
  BBCH51; 2X cotyledon, 2X green bud BBCH51; IX cotyledon, IX 10 % flower BBCH61;
  and 2X cotyledon, 2X 10 % flower BBCH61 expanded window treatments were included.
  Example 5. Comparision of GAT I to Control Treatments and Checks
          Crop response was similar across 3 hybrid background in Year 1 2X Cot and 2X
  Bolting BBCH55 expanded window treatment. All three hybrids evaluated in one location
  showed 1% chlorosis. One hybrid background had 3% chlorosis in a second location and
5 there was no crop response to this late glyphosate application treatment in the remaining
  eight locations. Full recovery of this low level transient chlorosis was observed 10 days
  after glyphosate application and yield was not significantly different compared to the
  control treatment. Four GAT-expressing canola backgrounds evaluated in extended
  window glyphosate treatments in Year 2 did not have any crop response. Treatments
0 included split applications IX Cot and IX BBCH51 (green bud stage); IX Cot and IX
  BBCH61 (10 % flower stage) across four backgrounds which did not result in yield
  reduction as compared to the control treatment. Additionally, the other two late split
  application treatments were 2X glyphosate (1350 g ae/ha) conducted at the same growth
                                                  54

  stages which did not result in yield reduction as compared to the control treatment.
  Compared to the controls, GAT1 did not show a reduction in yield at X treatment.
  Example 6. Comparision of GAT 2 to ControlTreatments and Checks
           GAT2 events were subjected to herbicide efficacy trials along with the GATI as
  diagonal check in 9 different locations. The herbicide efficacy trials consisted of 6
  treatments that included: a control with no glyphosate, 2X, 4X or 8X glyphosate
  administered at the 3-5 leaf stage (IX=675 g ae/ha), a 2X administered during the 3-5 leaf
  stage and during the green bud stage (+2X Green Bud), and a 2X administered during the 3
  5 leaf stage and during 10% bloom (+2X 10% Bloom). Herbicide-induced necrosis and
  chlorosis injury was recorded at leaf stages 5, 10, 21 and 30 DAT (days after treatment). No
  injury was observed beyond 10 DAT, and herbicide-induced necrotic injury was minimally
  observed, even at 8X spray rates (Figure 1). Negligible chlorotic injury was observed in the
  both GATI and GAT2 events tested, even at 8X spray rates, and during green bud, and 10%
  bloom (Figure 2). Yield from different treatments was expressed as a percent to the 2X
  treatment at the 3 to 5 leaf stage. The exposure of 2X application of glyphosate at the 3-5
  leaf stage, and during the green bud or 10% bloom stage led to no appreciable differences in
  yield compared to the respective 2X treatment in both GATI and GAT2 (Figure 3). The
  application of 4X glyphosate at the 3-5 leaf stage led to a 6 to 8% decrease in yield
  compared to the 2X treatment, and at the 8X rate, yield decreased from 10 to 12% in treated
  events compared to the 2X treatment (Figure 3).
  Example 7. Late Stage Application of Glyphosate on GATI entries
5          GATI entries were subjected to herbicide efficacy trials that included a 2X
  glyphosate treatment administered at the 3-5 leaf stage (1X=900 g ae/ha), and a 2X
  administered during the 3-5 leaf stage and during the first flower stage (BBCH60). Yield
  from different treatments was expressed as a percent to the 2X treatment at the 3 to 5 leaf
  stage. The exposure of 2X application of glyphosate at the 3-5 leaf stage, and during the
0 first flower stage led to no appreciable differences in yield compared to the respective 2X
  treatment in all GATI entries (Figure 4). Also, no significant herbicide-treatment based
  necrosis/chlorosis and no significant pod abortion or pale flowers were observed in
  response to the treatment.
  Example 8. Glyphosate Application Beyond the 10% Bloom Stage
                                                 55

         Extended window treatments may include 4X glyphosate applications when 20% of
the flowers are open on the main raceme (BBCH62) and 2X glyphosate applications when
30% of the flowers are open on the main raceme (BBCH63). These treatments may allow
growers to have effective weed control on tough to control weeds with higher glyphosate
application rates and extended weed control into the early flowering growth stages.
Glyphosate application at these stages may result in superior weed control and therefore
higher yields at maturity thus resulting in economic benefits for canola growers
