                                      ABSTRACT
             Ammunition containers are reloadable from within an armored vehicle to
supply a remote weapon system mounted externally on the vehicle. The ammunition
containers are designed to be fixedly mounted within an internal compartment of a
weapon turret. In a first embodiment, at least one guide wall defines a spiral guide
path for an ammunition belt, and a rotatable sprocket enables the belt to be loaded into
the guide path. In a second embodiment, an ammunition clamp holds a round of
ammunition, and the clamp is rotatable to wind the ammunition belt about the clamp's
axis of rotation. A third embodiment has a guide sprocket and an adjacent peg to
facilitate reloading an ammunition belt in horizontal layers. A fourth embodiment
includes a pair of spaced support rails for hanging an ammunition belt in vertical
columns, wherein rear ends of the rails may be located outside the container for easier
loading.

                           AMMUNITION STORAGE SYSTEM
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   [0001]      The present invention relates generally to the field of remote-controlled
   weapon stations or systems (RWSs) designed to mount over a hatch opening in a top
 5 deck of an armored vehicle, and more particularly to ammunition storage systems for
   storing and supplying linked ammunition to weapons of the externally-mounted RWS
   from within the armored vehicle.
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   [0002]      Vehicle-mounted RWSs are retrofittable to various types of military
10 vehicles, including but not limited to armored combat vehicles (ACVs), mine-resistant
   ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles, armored multi-purpose vehicles (AMPVs),
   amphibious assault vehicles (AAVs), and light armored vehicles (LAVs). The RWS
   allows personnel to operate externally-mounted weapons from the within the armored
   protection of the vehicle.
15 [0003]      An RWS may be outfitted with selected weapons (e.g. guns and missile
   launchers), and non-lethal operating units (e.g. target sighting units, acoustic hailers,
   and illuminators), to provide desired performance capabilities. Missile launchers
   suitable for use in an RWS include, without limitation, a Hellfire missile launcher, a
   Javelin missile launcher, and a TOW missile launcher. Automatic guns that process
20 linked ammunition are favored in RWS configurations. Some of the guns falling into
   this category are the MK44 chain gun, CTAI 30mm and 40mm canons, the M242
   chain gun, the M230LF autocannon, the M2 machine gun, the M3 submachine gun,
   the MK19 automatic grenade launcher, the M240 machine gun, the M249 light
   machine gun, and the M134 machine gun. Of course, an RWS may be outfitted with
25 weapons and operating units other than those specifically mentioned above.
   [0004]      The linked ammunition typically comes in the form of a long ammunition
   belt held within an ammunition container. The belt extends out through an exit
   opening in the container to an ammunition feed mechanism at the gun. As an existing
   ammunition belt advances and is used up during firing, a leading link of a subsequent
                                             -1 -

   ammunition belt may be coupled to a trailing link of the existing belt to accomplish
   reloading. In some systems, the new belt is loaded into the existing container, while
   in other systems, the existing emptied container is removed and replaced with a new
   container holding the new belt.
 5 [0005]       An ammunition container wherein the ammunition belt is folded in
   serpentine fashion to provide overlapping horizontal belt segments is known from
   U.S. Patent No. 2,470,475 (Diaper). The ammunition container described by Diaper
   has a plurality of foldable shelves that support the belt segments, and an antifriction
   roller adjacent an ammunition exit opening of the container.
10 [0006]       Another type of ammunition container designed to be reloaded when
   emptied is a hanging ammunition or suspended ammunition container. In this known
   arrangement, an ammunition belt is folded in serpentine fashion within the
   ammunition container, with upper links in the belt being supported by parallel rails at
   or near the top of the container so as to suspend or hang folded vertical segments of
15 the belt in the container. This type of "hanging ammo" arrangement is described, for
   example, in U.S. Patent No. 2,573,774 (Sandberg); U.S. Patent No. 4,433,609
   (Darnall); and U.S. Patent No. 8,763,511 (Schvartz et al.).
   [0007]       Ammunition storage and feeding systems wherein the ammunition belt is
   wound in a helical arrangement about a central axis with the individual rounds of
20 ammunition arranged to extend radially relative to the central axis are also known, as
   evidenced by U.S. Patent Nos. 2,833,182 (Houston et al.) and 5,111,729 (Tassie).
   The systems taught by Houston et al. and Tassie require a large diameter to
   accommodate storage of the radial ammunition rounds, with the diameter being
   dependent upon the overall length of the ammunition round. These systems also
25 require multi-axis motion to load ammunition, namely rotation about the central axis
   and translation along the central axis, which in turn has led to mechanically complex
   devices with many moving parts.
   [0008]       In designing an RWS, it is desirable to provide personnel with the
   capability to reload the externally mounted automatic guns with linked ammunition
30 while the personnel remain within the relatively safe confines of the armored vehicle.
   U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0186423 (Chachamian et al.) describes
   a system for protected reloading of an RWS. The system comprises an extendable
                                               -2-

   and retractable support bracket having a top plate attached to the RWS and a bottom
   plate for receiving and supporting an ammunition container. The bottom plate is
   connected to the top plate by four gas pistons enabling the bottom plate carrying the
   ammunition box to be raised up into the RWS turret for regular use and lowered down
 5 into the vehicle compartment for reloading. While the system enables reloading
   under armored protection, it requires a mechanically complicated bracket and uses
   space within the vehicle compartment to accommodate the lowered ammunition
   container during reloading. Given that the vehicle compartment is already very
   confined, this solution is not optimal.
10 [0009]      Another system for under armor reloading of ammunition is described in
   the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 8,763,511 (Schvartz et al.). The ammunition
   containers disclosed by Schvartz et al. are open at the front end and the rear end such
   that multiple containers may be stowed end-to-end in the RWS with their belts linked
   for regular use. An elevator mechanism is provided to lift ammunition containers
15 from the vehicle compartment through a hatch and into the RWS. When a rearmost
   container is emptied, it is removed manually or using the elevator to make room for
   another container. Here again, the system enables reloading under armored
   protection, but it requires an elevator mechanism and uses valuable space within the
   vehicle compartment. The system also dedicates limited space within the RWS
20 pedestal for multiple ammunition cans associated with only a single weapon.
   [0010]      What is needed is an ammunition storage system that has high reliability
   due to few moving parts, and that enables reloading of ammunition under armored
   protection without using valuable space within the vehicle compartment and without
   relying on a conveyor mechanism.
25 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
   [0011]      The invention provides an ammunition container for storing a belt of
   linked ammunition. The ammunition container is reliable, space efficient, and
   reloadable entirely above the vehicle roof within the armor protection of the turret.
   [0012]      An ammunition container formed in accordance with a first embodiment of
30 the invention generally comprises a pair of parallel side walls, at least one guide wall
   connecting the pair of side walls, and a sprocket rotatable about a sprocket axis
                                              -3 -

   extending normal to the pair of side walls. The at least one guide wall defines a
   loading access opening and an exit opening between the side walls, and further
   defines a guide path for a belt of ammunition, wherein the guide path begins at an
   origin and extends continuously from the origin to the exit opening. The at least one
 5 guide wall may include a spirally wound guide wall defining a generally spiraled
   guide path. The sprocket may be rotated to urge a belt of ammunition along the guide
   path in a loading direction from the loading access opening to the origin of the guide
   path.
   [0013]      An ammunition container formed in accordance with a second
10 embodiment of the invention operates in the manner of a spool. The ammunition
   container of the second embodiment generally comprises a pair of parallel side walls,
   an ammunition clamp mounted between the pair of side walls for rotation about a
   clamp axis extending normal to the pair of side walls, a keeper movable relative to the
   pair of parallel side walls. The ammunition clamp is configured to clamp a single
15 round of ammunition such that the round extends parallel to the clamp axis, and the
   ammunition clamp is rotatable about the clamp axis to wind a belt of ammunition
   about the clamp axis. The keeper is biased to exert force on a portion of a wound
   ammunition belt in a direction toward the clamp axis to maintain the ammunition belt
   in a wound condition as the ammunition belt is fed to a weapon. An outfeed roller
20 may be provided to help guide the rounds of the ammunition belt as they exit the
   container on their way to a weapon.
   [0014]      An ammunition container formed in accordance with a third embodiment
   of the invention is configured for manual reloading such that the belt of ammunition is
   guided into the container and may be easily folded over onto itself to form horizontal
25 layers. The ammunition container of the third embodiment comprises a pair of
   transversely spaced side walls and a bottom wall connecting the pair of side walls.
   The side walls define an internal space between them, an exit opening at a top front
   region of the container, and a loading access opening at a top rear of the container.
   The ammunition container of the third embodiment further comprises sprocket
30 positioned proximate to the loading access opening, and a transversely extending peg
   fixed relative to the pair of side walls at a location above and behind the sprocket.
   The sprocket is rotatable about a transverse sprocket axis relative to the pair of side
                                                -4-

   walls to guide rounds of ammunition through the loading access opening and into the
   internal space. The peg enables a new belt of linked ammunition to be suspended
   vertically adjacent the sprocket as the belt is being loaded into the container.
   [0015]       An ammunition container formed in accordance with a fourth embodiment
 5 of the present invention is an improved version of a hanging ammunition container.
   The ammunition container of the fourth embodiment comprises a pair of transversely
   spaced side walls connected by at least one transverse bride member. The pair of side
   walls define an internal space between them, and also define a rear opening and a
   bottom opening continuous with the rear opening, wherein the rear and bottom
10 openings allow access to the internal space. The ammunition container further
   comprises a pair of longitudinal support rails respectively mounted to corresponding
   inner surfaces of the pair of side walls. Each of the support rails may extend through
   the rear opening of the container such that a rear end of each support rail is located
   outside of the internal space for easier loading.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
   [0049]      Figs. 1-4 show an ammunition container 10 formed in accordance with a
   first embodiment of the present invention. Ammunition container 10 is useful for
   storing a belt of linked ammunition within an internal compartment of an RWS turret
 5 mounted on an armored vehicle, wherein the ammunition belt is fed round-by-round
   to an external weapon of the RWS. More particularly, ammunition container 10 is
   configured to be safely reloaded by personnel inside the armored vehicle without
   disconnecting or removing rounds between an exit opening of the container and the
   weapon, and provides space-efficient storage of ammunition in a confined
10 environment.
   [0050]      Ammunition container 10 of the first embodiment generally comprises a
   pair of parallel side walls 12A, 12B, at least one guide wall 14A, 14B connecting the
   pair of side walls, and a sprocket 16 rotatable about a sprocket axis 18 extending
   normal to the pair of side walls. As may be understood from Fig. 3, the at least one
15 guide wall 14A, 14B defines a loading access opening 20 between the pair of side
   walls 12A, 12B, and also defines an exit opening 22 between the pair of side walls. It
   is further apparent from Fig 3 that the at least one guide wall 14A, 14B defines a
   guide path 24 for a belt of ammunition, wherein the guide path begins at an origin 26
   and extends continuously from the origin to the exit opening 22.
20 [0051]      In the depicted embodiment, ammunition container 10 further comprises
   an access cover 28 removably covering the loading access opening 20. Access cover
   28 may be mounted on ammunition container 10 by a hinge 30 allowing access cover
   28 to pivot about a hinge axis that is parallel to sprocket axis 18 in the manner of a
   door. While a hinged access cover is shown, it will be understood that a sliding
25 access cover or an access cover that snaps on and off are possible alternatives. Access
   cover 28 may provide another guide wall 14C complementing guide walls 14A, 14B
   when access cover 28 is covering the loading access opening 20.
   [0052]      As best understood from Fig. 3, guide wall 14A of the present embodiment
   may be spirally wound in a spaced manner to help define guide path 24. Guide walls
30 14A-14C may include a pair of spaced support tracks 32, visible in Fig. 4, for
   engaging rounds of ammunition in an ammunition belt. Tracks 32 may be formed of
                                               -8-

   or coated with a material that exhibits high wear resistance and/or low friction, for
   example polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or an aluminum-nickel-bronze alloy.
   [0053]       Sprocket 16 may be positioned proximate to loading access opening 20.
   As seen in Fig. 2, sprocket 16 may include a pair of toothed sprocket elements 16A,
 5 16B spaced apart along sprocket axis 18, wherein the teeth of the sprocket elements
   have a pitch chosen to allow one round of ammunition between adjacent teeth.
   Ammunition container 10 may comprise a hand-crank 34 connected to sprocket 16 for
   allowing a user to manually rotate sprocket 16 about sprocket axis 18. Hand-crank 34
   may be connected to sprocket 16 by a ratchet mechanism (not shown) for enabling
10 rotation of sprocket 16 in a first rotational direction, e.g. counterclockwise in Fig. 3,
   while preventing rotation of the sprocket in a second rotational direction opposite to
   the first rotational direction, e.g. clockwise in Fig. 3. As will be understood from
   description that follows, a ratchet mechanism is beneficial to prevent a belt of
   ammunition from sliding out of ammunition container 10 during loading. The
15 connection between hand-crank 34 and sprocket 16 may be releasable to prevent the
   hand-crank from rotating with sprocket 16 when an ammunition belt is being fed to a
   weapon. Hand-crank 34 may have a foldable handle 34A that is foldable against a
   drive arm 34B of the hand-crank to keep the handle out of the way when not in use.
   While a hand-crank is shown, persons skilled in the art will recognize that a motor
20 may be provided to drive rotation of sprocket 16.
   [0054]       A process of reloading ammunition container 10 of the first embodiment
   will now be described with reference to Figs. 5-8. As will be understood, sprocket 16
   is rotatable about sprocket axis 18 to urge a belt of ammunition along guide path 24 in
   a loading direction from the loading access opening 20 to the origin 26. Fig. 5 shows
25 ammunition container 10 as it is becoming depleted of a prior ammunition belt 2
   having individual rounds 3. Belt 2 is pulled in a weapon feed direction by a feed
   mechanism associated with an automatic weapon. As may be seen, a trailing round
   3Z of belt 2 is at loading access opening 20, which is covered by access cover 28. To
   reload ammunition container 10, access cover 28 is opened as shown in Fig. 6, and a
30 new ammunition belt 4 having individual rounds 5 is inserted through loading access
   opening 20. More specifically, a trailing round 5Z of belt 4 is positioned between
   teeth of sprocket 16, and sprocket 16 is rotated counterclockwise as shown in Fig. 6 to
                                               -9-

   urge belt 4 inward along guide path 24. As will be understood from Fig. 7, a leading
   round 5A of new belt 4 will emerge from ammunition box 1 and is clipped onto the
   trailing round 3Z of prior ammunition belt 2. Rotation of sprocket 16 is continued
   until a trailing round 5Z of new belt 4 reaches origin 26, as illustrated in Fig. 8,
 5 thereby completing the reloading process. As will be understood, the at least one
   guide wall 14A-14C prevents the rounds of ammunition 5 in ammunition belt 4 from
   touching one another. The driving connection between hand-crank 34 and sprocket
   16 may then be released so the hand-crank does not spin as ammunition is fed out of
   container 10 to a weapon.
10 [0055]       A similar process is followed to load ammunition container 10 with a new
   ammunition belt when no portion of a prior ammunition belt is in the container,
   except that the leading round 5A of the new belt 4 is inserted up through exit opening
   22 to the weapon feed mechanism.
   [0056]       Figs. 9-11 show an ammunition container 40 formed in accordance with a
15 second embodiment of the present invention. Like ammunition container 10 of the
   first embodiment, ammunition container 40 of the second embodiment is configured
   to be safely reloaded by personnel inside the armored vehicle without disconnecting
   or removing rounds between an exit opening of the container and the weapon, and
   provides space-efficient storage of ammunition in a confined environment.
20 [0057]       Ammunition container 40 is configured such that an ammunition belt may
   be wound into the container in the manner of a spool. Ammunition container 40
   generally comprises a pair of parallel side walls 42A, 42B, an ammunition clamp 46
   mounted between the pair of side walls for rotation about a clamp axis 48 extending
   normal to the pair of side walls, and a keeper 54 movable relative to the pair of
25 parallel side walls. Ammunition container 40 may further comprise a peripheral wall
   44 connecting side walls 42A, 42B, wherein the peripheral wall 44 defines a loading
   access opening 56 between the pair of side walls and an exit opening 58 between the
   pair of side walls.
   [0058]       As will be understood from Fig. 11, keeper 54 is spring-biased to exert
30 force on a portion of a wound ammunition belt 2 in a direction toward clamp axis 48
   to prevent unwinding and maintain the ammunition belt in a wound condition as the
   ammunition belt is fed to a weapon. As illustrated by the depicted embodiment,
                                             - 10  -

   keeper 54 may be hingedly mounted on ammunition container 40 by a hinge 60 to
   pivot about a hinge axis that is parallel to clamp axis 48. Hinge 60 may incorporate a
   torsion spring (not shown) for pivotally biasing keeper 54 toward clamp axis 48.
   While a hinged keeper 54 is shown, other types of keeper mechanisms may be
 5 employed, for example a radially biased plunger or retainer. Advantageously, keeper
   54 may also be configured to removably cover loading access opening 56.
   [0059]       As best seen in Fig. 10, ammunition clamp 46 is configured to clamp a
   single round of ammunition 3 such that the round extends parallel to clamp axis 48.
   In the present embodiment clamp 46 includes a pair of resiliently deflectable C-clamp
10 arms 46A, 46B for releasably gripping the round of ammunition 3. Ammunition
   clamp 46 may be located at a central region of ammunition container 40 and is
   rotatable about clamp axis 48 to wind a belt of ammunition about the clamp axis. An
   additional sprocket-type support (not shown) may be used to help shape the rounds in
   a spooled configuration during winding. Ammunition container 40 may comprise a
15 hand-crank 62 connected to ammunition clamp 46 for allowing a user to manually
   rotate ammunition clamp 46 about clamp axis 48. As in the first embodiment
   described above, hand-crank 62 may be connected to ammunition clamp 46 by a
   ratchet mechanism (not shown) for enabling rotation of ammunition clamp 46 in a
   first rotational direction, e.g. clockwise in Fig. 11, while preventing rotation of the
20 ammunition clamp in a second rotational direction opposite to the first rotational
   direction, e.g. counterclockwise in Fig. 11. As will be understood from description
   that follows, a ratchet mechanism is desirable to prevent a belt of ammunition from
   unwinding out of ammunition container 10 during loading. Here again, the
   connection between hand-crank 62 and ammunition clamp 46 may be releasable to
25 prevent the hand-crank from rotating with ammunition clamp 46 when an ammunition
   belt is being fed to a weapon, and hand-crank 62 may have a foldable handle 62A that
   is foldable against a drive arm 62B of the hand-crank to keep the handle out of the
   way when not in use. While a hand-crank is shown, persons skilled in the art will
   recognize that a motor may be provided to drive rotation of ammunition clamp 46.
30 [0060]       Ammunition container 40 may further comprise an outfeed roller 50
   mounted between the pair of side walls 42A, 42B for rotation about a roller axis 52
   extending parallel to clamp axis 48. Outfeed roller 50 is spaced from ammunition
                                               - 11 -

   clamp 46, and may be positioned near exit opening 58 to help guide a belt of
   ammunition to ensure that the rounds are always pulled tangentially from the spooled
   winding as the belt unwinds during firing of a weapon.
   [0061]       A process of reloading ammunition container 40 of the second
 5 embodiment will now be described with reference to Figs. 11-14. Fig. 11 shows
   ammunition container 40 as it is becoming depleted of a prior ammunition belt 2
   having individual rounds 3. Belt 2 is pulled in a weapon feed direction by a feed
   mechanism associated with an automatic weapon. As may be seen, a trailing round
   3Z of belt 2 is clamped in ammunition clamp 46. To reload ammunition container 10,
10 keeper 54 is opened outward as shown in Fig. 12, trailing round 3Z of prior
   ammunition belt 2 is pulled out of ammunition clamp 46 to permit a trailing portion of
   belt 2 to unwind, and a trailing round 5Z of new belt 4 is inserted through loading
   access opening 56 and clamped in ammunition clamp 46. As illustrated in Fig. 13,
   ammunition clamp 46 is then rotated clockwise to wind new belt 4 onto itself. A
15 leading round 5A of new belt 4 will emerge from ammunition box 1 and is clipped
   onto the trailing round 3Z of prior ammunition belt 2. Rotation of ammunition clamp
   46 is continued until new belt is fully wound and keeper may be closed against the
   belt, as illustrated in Fig. 14, thereby completing the reloading process. The driving
   connection between hand-crank 62 and ammunition clamp 46 may then be released so
20 the hand-crank does not spin as ammunition is fed out of container 40 to a weapon.
   The clamping force exerted by ammunition clamp 46 may be chosen such that the
   feed mechanism associated with a weapon can pull an ammunition belt with enough
   force to remove a trailing round from the ammunition clamp if an operator chooses to
   fire all round before reloading.
25 [0062]       A similar process is followed to load ammunition container 40 with a new
   ammunition belt when no portion of a prior ammunition belt is in the container,
   except that the leading round 5A of the new belt 4 is inserted up around outfeed roller
   50 and through exit opening 58 to the weapon feed mechanism.
   [0063]       An ammunition container 70 formed in accordance with a third
30 embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figs. 15-25. Ammunition container
   70 of the third embodiment is configured to be safely reloaded by personnel inside the
   armored vehicle without disconnecting or removing rounds between an exit opening
                                              - 12 -

   of the container and the weapon, and provides space-efficient storage of ammunition
   in a confined environment. Ammunition container 70 may be used, for example, to
   store linked ammunition rounds for an MK19 automatic grenade launcher.
   [0064]      Ammunition container 70 of the third embodiment generally comprises a
 5 pair of transversely spaced side walls 72A, 72B and a bottom wall 74 connecting side
   walls 72A, 72B, wherein the pair of side walls define an internal space 75 between
   them. Side walls 72A, 72B also define an exit opening 82 at a top front region of
   container 70 and a loading access opening 80 at a top rear of the container. As shown
   in Figs. 15-18, side walls 72A, 72B may be parallel to one another.
10 [0065]      Ammunition container 70 further comprises a sprocket 76 positioned
   proximate to loading access opening 80, wherein sprocket 76 is rotatable about a
   transverse sprocket axis 78 relative to side walls 72A, 72B to guide rounds of
   ammunition through loading access opening 80 and into the internal space 75.
   Sprocket 76 may include a first sprocket wheel 76A and a second sprocket wheel 76B
15 each having teeth 77 (see Fig. 19) angularly spaced about sprocket axis 78 to define
   recesses for receiving individual rounds in a belt of ammunition. Sprocket wheels
   76A and 76B may be transversely spaced from one another to providing a space 79
   between the sprocket wheels 76A, 76B for accommodating a linkage connecting
   individual rounds in a belt of ammunition.
20 [0066]      Ammunition container 70 may also comprise a transversely extending peg
   84 fixed relative to the pair of side walls 72A, 72B at a location above and behind (i.e.
   rearward from) sprocket 76. Peg 84 may have a free end 85 not covered by either of
   the pair of side walls 72A, 72B. For example, as depicted in Figs. 15-18, one of the
   side walls 72B may include a rear extension 73 not opposed by the other side wall
25 72A, wherein peg 84 is cantilevered to extend transversely from the rear extension 73.
   [0067]      Attention is directed now to Figs. 19 and 20. Ammunition container 70
   may further comprise a ratchet and pawl mechanism 86 arranged to permit rotation of
   sprocket 76 about sprocket axis 78 in a loading direction (counterclockwise in Figs.
   19 and 20) and to prevent rotation of sprocket 76 about sprocket axis 78 in a direction
30 opposite to the loading direction (clockwise in Figs. 19 and 20). In the illustrated
   embodiment, ratchet and pawl mechanism 86 includes a toothed ratchet wheel 87 and
   a pivotally mounted pawl 88 torsionally biased about a pivot axis 89 by a torsion
                                              - 13 -

   spring 90 to engage with teeth of ratchet wheel 87 in a well-known manner. A pawl
   release lever 92 is operable to disengage pawl 88 from ratchet wheel 87 to selectively
   permit rotation of sprocket 76 about sprocket axis 78 in the direction opposite to the
   loading direction.
 5 [0068]      One of the pair of side walls 72A, 72B may include an access opening 93
   and a cover panel 94 covering the access opening 93, wherein the cover panel 94 is
   displaceable to expose access opening 93. For example, as shown in Figs. 15 and 18,
   cover panel 94 may be slidably held by a pair of slotted retention members 96 such
   that cover panel can be completely removed from ammunition container 70 during
10 loading of ammunition, and then reinstalled after loading is completed. Other
   arrangements for displaceably mounting cover panel 94 on ammunition container 70
   may be used, such as a hinged or pivoting connections. Cover panel 94 may include a
   handle 95.
   [0069]      Ammunition container 70 may comprise a pair of mounting flanges 98
15 extending along respective top edges of the pair of side walls 72A, 72B. Each
   mounting flange 98 may have a plurality of fastener holes 99 for use in mounting
   ammunition container 70 to overhead structure. For example, ammunition container
   70 may be fixedly connected to an interior wall surface of a top wall of a rotatable
   turret of an armored vehicle using threaded fasteners such that the ammunition
20 container is suspended in an upper region of the compartment and is accessible by
   operating personnel. The connection may be direct, or via a bracket or other
   intermediate mounting member.
   [0070]      Figs. 21-25 illustrate a process for reloading ammunition container 70 with
   an additional belt of linked ammunition. In Fig. 21, the remaining rounds 3 of a prior
25 ammunition belt 2 are shown. As may be understood, belt 2 is pulled in a weapon
   feed direction by a feed mechanism associated with an automatic weapon. A trailing
   round 3Z of belt can be seen in Fig. 21. To reload ammunition container 70, a leading
   end of a new ammunition belt 4 having individual rounds 5 is draped around peg 84
   and a leading round 5A of new belt 4 is clipped to trailing round 3Z of prior belt 2 as
30 shown in Fig. 22. A trailing end of new belt 4 is positioned on sprocket 76 for guided
   insertion into container 70, such that new belt forms a U-shaped dip between peg 84
   and sprocket 76. Peg 84 is advantageously spaced from sprocket 76 in a rearward
                                              - 14 -

   direction such that ammunition rounds in the adjacent vertical portions of the U
   shaped dip do not contact one another. Referring now to Fig. 23, the trailing end of
   new belt 4 is pulled into the interior of container 70, causing sprocket 76 to rotate
   counterclockwise in the view of Fig. 23, and a trailing round 5Z of new belt 4 is
 5 positioned at a lower rear corner of container 70 diagonally opposite exit opening 82.
   A first layer of new belt 4 is then arranged rear-to-front along bottom wall 74. Belt 4
   may then be looped around and a second layer may be arranged front-to-rear over the
   first layer. As shown in Fig. 24, this process may be repeated to form additional
   layers until the slack in belt 4 is taken up and it is necessary to remove new belt 4
10 from peg 84 to load the remaining rounds 5. Fig. 25 shows container 70 after
   reloading is completed.
   [0071]       The reloading process shown in Figs. 21-25 assumes that the new
   ammunition belt 4 has forty-eight rounds, however a new belt having thirty-two
   rounds or some other number of rounds may be loaded in substantially the same
15 manner. Rather than draping the leading end of new belt 4 over peg 84, personnel
   may drape a trailing end of prior belt 2 over peg 84 and clip the leading round 5A of
   new belt 4 to a vertically suspended trailing round 3Z of prior belt 2 at a location
   outside of container 70. A similar process may also be followed to load ammunition
   container 70 with a new ammunition belt when no portion of a prior ammunition belt
20 is in the container, except that the leading round 5A of the new belt 4 is inserted up
   through exit opening 82 to the weapon feed mechanism.
   [0072]       An ammunition container 110 formed in accordance with a fourth
   embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figs. 26-32. Ammunition container
   110 of the fourth embodiment can be safely reloaded by personnel inside the armored
25 vehicle without disconnecting or removing rounds between an exit opening of the
   container and the weapon, and provides space-efficient storage of ammunition in a
   confined environment. Ammunition container 110 may be used, for example, to store
   linked ammunition rounds for an M2 machine gun.
   [0073]       Ammunition container 110 of the fourth embodiment generally comprises
30 a pair of transversely spaced side walls 112A, 112B and at least one bridge member
   113, 114, and/or 116 connecting the side walls 112A, 112B. The pair of side walls
   define an internal space 115 between them. Side walls 112A, 112B also define a rear
                                               - 15 -

   opening 118 and a bottom opening 120 continuous with rear opening 118. Rear
   opening 118 and bottom opening 120 allow access to internal space 115. As
   illustrated in Figs. 26-29, rear opening 118 may extend over the entire height of side
   walls 1 12A, 112B, and bottom opening 120 may extend over substantially the entire
 5 length of side walls 112A, 112B. Side walls 112A, 112B may be parallel to one
   another.
   [0074]       In the illustrated embodiment, ammunition container 110 includes a front
   bridge member 113, a first top bridge member 114, and a second top bridge member
   116. Each of the top bridge members 114, 116 may include one or more fastener
10 holes 117 for use in mounting ammunition container 110 to overhead structure. For
   example, ammunition container 110 may be fixedly connected to an interior wall
   surface of a top wall of a rotatable turret of an armored vehicle using threaded
   fasteners such that the ammunition container is suspended in an upper region of the
   compartment and is accessible by operating personnel. The connection may be direct,
15 or via a bracket or other intermediate mounting member.
   [0075]       Ammunition container 110 of the fourth embodiment further comprises a
   pair of longitudinal support rails 124A, 124B for supporting hanging ammunition.
   Support rails 124A, 124B are respectively mounted to an inner surface of a
   corresponding one of the pair of side walls 1 12A, 1 12B. Each support rail 124A,
20 124B includes a front end 126 and a rear end 128. As best seen in Fig. 27, each of the
   pair of support rails 124A, 124B may extend through rear opening 118 such that the
   rear end 128 of each support rail 124A, 124B is located outside of the internal space
   115 and is easily accessible during an ammunition reloading operation. Support rails
   124A, 124B are laterally spaced from one another to provide an intermediate slot 127
25 through which a flexible linkage connecting rounds of an ammunition belt may
   extend. In the illustrated embodiment, one of the pair of support rails 124B has an
   upwardly facing support surface 125B that is raised relative to an upwardly facing
   support surface 125A of the other support rail 124A. This feature may be
   advantageous in supporting ammunition rounds having a reduced diameter at one end
30 (i.e. a pointed tip) in a level manner. Support rails 124A, 124B may be inclined
   slightly downward toward a middle region of container 110 to better retain hanging
   ammunition.
                                               - 16 -

   [0076]      Ammunition container 110 may also comprise a removable pin 130
   extending transversely through aligned holes 132A, 132B in side walls 112A, 112B
   near a top rear corner of the ammunition container. Removable pin 130 helps retain
   hanging ammunition on support rails 124A, 124B during rough terrain trundling by
 5 the armored vehicle.
   [0077]      Reloading of ammunition container 110 will now be described with
   reference to Figs. 30-32. Fig. 30 shows a condition wherein a remaining portion of a
   prior ammunition belt 2 is suspended in container 110 prior to reloading. More
   specifically, a round 3B of prior ammunition belt 2 is supported on rails 124A, 124B,
10 and a next adjacent round 3C is also supported on rails 124A, 124B. A trailing round
   3Z of the prior ammunition belt 2, which may be the twelfth round counting from
   (and including) round 3C, is the final round of prior belt 2. As shown in Fig. 31, a
   leading round 5A of a new ammunition belt 4 is clipped to trailing round 3Z of prior
   ammunition belt 2, and a pair of adjacent subsequent rounds 5B, 5C of new belt 4 are
15 then slid over the rear ends 128 of support rails 124A, 124B for support by the rails.
   The task of hanging the supporting rounds (e.g. rounds 5B and 5C) is facilitated by
   locating rear ends 128 of support rails 124A, 124B externally beyond the rear edges
   of side walls 112A, 112B. Round 5B may be the twelfth round counting from (and
   including) leading round 5A. This process may be repeated until the entire new belt 4
20 is hung in serpentine fashion from support rails 124A, 124B as shown in Fig. 32.
   Container 110 may be sized to hold twenty-three columns having twelve rounds in
   each column. In order to avoid splitting new boxes of ammunition, and to have the
   benefit of counting in multiples of ten, reloading may be carried out such that twenty
   columns are loaded having ten rounds in each column. Of course, container 110 may
25 be loaded such that the number of rounds in each column differs from ten or twelve
   rounds, and the number of rounds may vary from column to column.
   [0078]      It will be appreciated that ammunition containers 10, 40, 70 and 110 are
   space-efficient, have few moving parts and are therefore reliable, and may be reloaded
   with ammunition from within an armored vehicle. The ammunition container
30 disclosed herein may be fixedly mounted within a turret compartment and do not need
   to be dropped down out of the compartment for reloading.
