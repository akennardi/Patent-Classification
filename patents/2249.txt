 5                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   [00031     Studies have correlated mitochondrial function with the disease of cardiomyopathy and
   for neuron health and survival. Specifically, aberrant mitochondrial quality control has been
   demonstrated to be an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases and
   cardiomyopathy.     . The mitochondrial kinase PTEN Induced Kinase 1 (PINK1) plays an
 0 important role in the mitochondrial quality control processes by responding to damage at the
   level of individual mitochondria. The PINK1 pathway has also been linked to the induction of
   mitochondrial biogenesis, and, critically, the reduction of mitochondrially induced apoptosis. 34,1 1
   [00041     Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders,
   however no disease modifying therapies are currently approved to treat PD. Both environmental
25 and genetic factors lead to progressive apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons, lowered dopamine
   levels and ultimately PD. PINK1 kinase activity appears to mediate its neuroprotective activity.
   The regulation of mitochondrial movement, distribution and clearance is a key part of neuronal
   oxidative stress response. Disruptions to these regulatory pathways have been shown to
   contribute to chronic neurodegenerative disease' .
30 [00051     Cardiomyopathy refers to a disease of cardiac muscle tissue, and it is estimated that
   cardiomyopathy accounts for 5-10% of the 5-6 million patients already diagnosed with heart
   failure in the United States. Based on etiology and pathophysiology, the World Health
                                                      I

    WO 2014/124458                                                                PCT/US2014/015863
   Organization created a classification of cardiomyopathy types which includes dilated
   cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic
   right ventriclular cardiomyopathy, and unclassified cardiomyopathy. PINK1 kinase activity
   appears to mediate its cardioprotective activity. The regulation of mitochondrial movement,
 5 distribution and clearance is a key part of cardiac cell oxidative stress response. Disruptions to
   these regulatory pathways have been shown to contribute to cardiomyopathy.1         2

   need in the art for effective PINK1 agonists and compounds for treating neurodegenerative
   diseases such as Parkinson's disease and cardiomyopathy. Disclosed herein are solutions to
   these and other problems in the art.

                             DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
15 [0041]     The abbreviations used herein have their conventional meaning within the chemical and
   biological arts. The chemical structures and formulae set forth herein are constructed according
   to the standard rules of chemical valency known in the chemical arts.
   [0042]     Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae,
   written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that
20 would result from writing the structure from right to left, e.g., -CH 20- is equivalent to -OCH 2 -.
   [0043]     The term "alkyl," by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise
   stated, a straight (i.e., unbranched) or branched carbon chain (or carbon), or combination thereof,
   which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent
   radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e., C1 -C10 means one to ten carbons).
25 Alkyl is not cyclized. Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to,
   groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl,
   (cyclohexyl)methyl, homologs and isomers of, for example, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl,
   and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds
   (e.g. alkene, alkyne). Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, vinyl,
30 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl,
   1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers. An alkoxy is an alkyl
   attached to the remainder of the molecule via an oxygen linker (-0-).

    WO 2014/124458                                                                   PCT/US2014/015863
   [0044]     The term "alkylene," by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise
   stated, a divalent radical derived from an alkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by,
   CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 -. Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms,
   with those groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being preferred in the present invention. A
 5 "lower alkyl" or "lower alkylene" is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having
   eight or fewer carbon atoms. The term "alkenylene," by itself or as part of another substituent,
   means, unless otherwise stated, a divalent radical derived from an alkene.
   [0045]     The term "heteroalkyl," by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless
   otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or combinations thereof, including at least
10 one carbon atom and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of 0, N, P, Si,
   and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized, and the nitrogen
   heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. Heteroalkyl is not cyclized. The heteroatom(s) 0, N,
   P, S, and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at
   which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are
15 not limited to: -CH 2 -CH 2 -0-CH3 , -CH 2 -CH 2 -NH-CH 3 , -CH 2 -CH 2 -N(CH 3 )-CH 3 , -CH 2 -S-CH 2
   CH 3, -CH 2 -CH 2 , -S(O)-CH 3, -CH 2 -CH 2 -S(O) 2 -CH 3 , -CH=CH-0-CH 3 , -Si(CH 3) 3 , -CH 2 -CH=N
   OCH 3 , -CH=CH-N(CH 3)-CH 3, -O-CH 3 , -O-CH 2 -CH 3 , and -CN. Up to two or three heteroatoms
   may be consecutive, such as, for example, -CH 2-NH-OCH 3 and -CH 2 -0-Si(CH 3 ) 3 .
   [0046]     Similarly, the term "heteroalkylene," by itself or as part of another substituent, means,
20 unless otherwise stated, a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not
   limited by, -CH 2-CH 2 -S-CH 2 -CH 2 - and -CH 2 -S-CH 2 -CH 2-NH-CH 2 -. For heteroalkylene groups,
   heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy,
   alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and
   heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in
25 which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula -C(O) 2 R'- represents
   both -C(O) 2 R'- and -R'C(O) 2 -. As described above, heteroalkyl groups, as used herein, include
   those groups that are attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom, such as
   C(O)R', -C(O)NR', -NR'R", -OR', -SR', and/or -S0 2 R'. Where "heteroalkyl" is recited, followed
   by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups, such as -NR'R" or the like, it will be understood that
30 the terms heteroalkyl and -NR'R" are not redundant or mutually exclusive. Rather, the specific
   heteroalkyl groups are recited to add clarity. Thus, the term "heteroalkyl" should not be
   interpreted herein as excluding specific heteroalkyl groups, such as -NR'R" or the like.
   [0047]     The terms "cycloalkyl" and "heterocycloalkyl," by themselves or in combination with
   other terms, mean, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of "alkyl" and "heteroalkyl,"
                                                         9

    WO 2014/124458                                                                PCT/US2014/015863
   respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which
   the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl
   are non-aromatic. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl,
   cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like.
 5 Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, 1-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1
   piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl,
   tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl, tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1-piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and
   the like. A "cycloalkylene" and a "heterocycloalkylene," alone or as part of another substituent,
   means a divalent radical derived from a cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl, respectively.
10 [0048]     The terms "halo" or "halogen," by themselves or as part of another substituent, mean,
   unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally, terms such
   as "haloalkyl" are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For example, the term
   "halo(C 1 -C4)alkyl" includes, but is not limited to, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl,
   2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.
15 [0049]     The term "acyl" means, unless otherwise stated, -C(O)R where R is a substituted or
   unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted
   heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, or
   substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl.
   [0050]     The term "aryl" means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, aromatic,
20 hydrocarbon substituent, which can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from 1 to 3
   rings) that are fused together (i.e., a fused ring aryl) or linked covalently. A fused ring aryl refers
   to multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is an aryl ring. The term
   "heteroaryl" refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain at least one heteroatom such as N, 0, or
   S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are
25 optionally quaternized. Thus, the term "heteroaryl" includes fused ring heteroaryl groups (i.e.,
   multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is a heteroaromatic ring). A
   5,6-fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 5 members
   and the other ring has 6 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. Likewise, a
   6,6-fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 6 members
30 and the other ring has 6 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. And a 6,5
   fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 6 members and
   the other ring has 5 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. A heteroaryl
   group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a carbon or heteroatom. Non
   limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4
                                                       10

   Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the
   group of acceptable substituents described below. An "arylene" and a "heteroarylene," alone or
   as part of another substituent, mean a divalent radical derived from an aryl and heteroaryl,
   respectively. Non-limiting examples of heteroaryl groups include pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl,
10 thiophenyl, thienyl, furanyl, indolyl, benzoxadiazolyl, benzodioxolyl, benzodioxanyl,
   thianaphthanyl, pyrrolopyridinyl, indazolyl, quinolinyl, quinoxalinyl, pyridopyrazinyl,

   benzothiophenyl, phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazinyl,
   oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, furylthienyl, pyridyl, pyrimidyl, benzothiazolyl, purinyl,

   benzothiadiazolyl, isothiazolyl, pyrazolopyrimidinyl, pyrrolopyrimidinyl, benzotriazolyl,
   benzoxazolyl, or quinolyl. The examples above may be substituted or unsubstituted and divalent
   radicals of each heteroaryl example above are non-limiting examples of heteroarylene.
   [0051]    A fused ring heterocyloalkyl-aryl is an aryl fused to a heterocycloalkyl. A fused ring
20 heterocycloalkyl-heteroaryl is a heteroaryl fused to a heterocycloalkyl. A fused ring
   heterocycloalkyl-cycloalkyl is a heterocycloalkyl fused to a cycloalkyl. A fused ring
   heterocycloalkyl-heterocycloalkyl is a heterocycloalkyl fused to another heterocycloalkyl. Fused
   ring heterocycloalkyl-aryl, fused ring heterocycloalkyl-heteroaryl, fused ring heterocycloalkyl
   cycloalkyl, or fused ring heterocycloalkyl-heterocycloalkyl may each independently be
25 unsubstituted or substituted with one or more of the substitutents described herein.
   [0052]    The term "oxo," as used herein, means an oxygen that is double bonded to a carbon
   atom.
   [0053]    The term "alkylsulfonyl," as used herein, means a moiety having the formula -S(0        2 )-R',
   where R' is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group as defined above. R' may have a specified
30 number of carbons (e.g., "C1 -C 4 alkylsulfonyl").
   [0054]    Each of the above terms (e.g., "alkyl," "heteroalkyl," "aryl," and "heteroaryl") includes
   both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred substituents for each
   type of radical are provided below.

   [0055]     Substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals (including those groups often
   referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl,
   heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) can be one or more of a variety of
   groups selected from, but not limited to, -OR', =0, =NR', =N-OR', -NR'R", -SR', -halogen,
 5 SiR'R"R"', -OC(O)R', -C(O)R', -CO 2 R', -CONR'R", -OC(O)NR'R", -NR"C(O)R', -NR'
   C(O)NR"R"', -NR"C(O) 2R', -NR-C(NR'R"R.')=NR"", -NR-C(NR'R")=NR"', -S(O)R', -S(O) 2R',

   monophosphate (or derivatives thereof), diphosphate (or derivatives thereof), triphosphate (or
   derivatives thereof), in a number ranging from zero to (2m'+1), where m' is the total number of
10 carbon atoms in such radical. R, R', R", R"', and R"" each preferably independently refer to
   hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl,
   substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl (e.g., aryl
   substituted with 1-3 halogens), substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, substituted or
   unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy, or thioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups. When a compound of the
15 invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently
   selected as are each R', R", R"', and R"" group when more than one of these groups is present.
   When R' and R" are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen
   atom to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, -NR'R" includes, but is not limited
   to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in
20 the art will understand that the term "alkyl" is meant to include groups including carbon atoms
   bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., -CF 3 and -CH 2CF 3) and
   acyl (e.g., -C(O)CH 3, -C(O)CF 3, -C(O)CH 2 0CH3 , and the like).
   [0056]     Similar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for the aryl and
   heteroaryl groups are varied and are selected from, for example: -OR', -NR'R", -SR', -halogen,
25 SiR'R"R"', -OC(O)R', -C(O)R', -CO 2 R', -CONR'R", -OC(O)NR'R", -NR"C(O)R', -NR'

   S(O) 2NR'R", -NRSO 2R', -NR'NR"R'", -ONR'R", -NR'C=(O)NR"NR"'R"", -CN, -NO 2 , -R', -N 3 ,
   -CH(Ph) 2, fluoro(CI-C 4 )alkoxy, and fluoro(CI-C 4)alkyl, monophosphate (or derivatives thereof),
   diphosphate (or derivatives thereof), triphosphate (or derivatives thereof), in a number ranging
30 from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and where R', R",
   R"', and R"" are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted
   alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl,
   substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, and substituted or
   unsubstituted heteroaryl. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group,
                                                     12

   for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R', R", R"', and R""
   groups when more than one of these groups is present.
   [0057]      Two or more substituents may optionally be joined to form aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl,
   or heterocycloalkyl groups. Such so-called ring-forming substituents are typically, though not
 5 necessarily, found attached to a cyclic base structure. In one embodiment, the ring-forming
   substituents are attached to adjacent members of the base structure. For example, two ring
   forming substituents attached to adjacent members of a cyclic base structure create a fused ring
   structure. In embodiments, the ring-forming substituents are attached to a single member of the
   base structure. For example, two ring-forming substituents attached to a single member of a
10 cyclic base structure create a spirocyclic structure. In yet another embodiment, the ring-forming
   substituents are attached to non-adjacent members of the base structure.
   [0058]      Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally
   form a ring of the formula -T-C(O)-(CRR')q-U-, wherein T and U are independently -NR-, -0-,
   CRR'-, or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 3. Alternatively, two of the substituents
15 on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of
   the formula -A-(CH2)r-B-, wherein A and B are independently -CRR'-, -0-, -NR-, -5-, -S(O) -,
   S(O) 2 -, -S(O) 2 NR'-, or a single bond, and r is an integer of from 1 to 4. One of the single bonds
   of the new ring so formed may optionally be replaced with a double bond. Alternatively, two of
   the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with
20 a substituent of the formula -(CRR')s-X'- (C"R"R")d-, where s and d are independently integers
   of from 0 to 3, and X' is -0-, -NR'-, -S-, -S(O)-,    -S(O) 2-, or -S(O) 2 NR'-. The substituents R, R',
   R", and R"' are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted
   alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl,
   substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, and substituted or
25 unsubstituted heteroaryl.
   [0059]      As used herein, the terms "heteroatom" or "ring heteroatom" are meant to include,
   oxygen (0), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), and silicon (Si).

   [0066]     The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" is meant to include salts of the active
25 compounds that are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular
   substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present
   invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by
   contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base,
   either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition
30 salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a
   similar salt. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities,
   acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a
   sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of
   pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like
                                                     16

   hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric,
   monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or
   phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids
   like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic,
 5 mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the
   like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic
   acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, e.g., Berge et al., Journalof
   PharmaceuticalScience 66:1-19 (1977)). Certain specific compounds of the present invention
   contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either
10 base or acid addition salts. Other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers known to those of skill in
   the art are suitable for the present invention. Salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous or other
   protonic solvents that are the corresponding free base forms. In other cases, the preparation may
   be a lyophilized powder in 1 mM-50 mM histidine, 0.1%-2% sucrose, 2%-7% mannitol at a pH
   range of 4.5 to 5.5, that is combined with buffer prior to use.
15 [0067]     Thus, the compounds of the present invention may exist as salts, such as with
   pharmaceutically acceptable acids. The present invention includes such salts. Examples of such
   salts include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, methanesulfonates, nitrates, maleates,
   acetates, citrates, fumarates, tartrates (e.g., (+)-tartrates, (-)-tartrates, or mixtures thereof
   including racemic mixtures), succinates, benzoates, and salts with amino acids such as glutamic
20 acid. These salts may be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art.
   [0068]     The neutral forms of the compounds are preferably regenerated by contacting the salt
   with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent
   form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as
   solubility in polar solvents.
25 [0069]     In addition to salt forms, the present invention provides compounds, which are in a
   prodrug form. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are those compounds that readily
   undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the
   present invention. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present
   invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example,
30 prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present invention when placed in a
   transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent. In embodiments, the
   prodrug form may include a phosphate derivative or a sugar (e.g. ribose) derivative. For
   example prodrugs moieties used in HCV nucleoside and nucleotide prodrugs may be added to
   the compounds described herein or the compounds used in methods described herein. In

   [0070]      Certain compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as
10 solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to
   unsolvated forms and are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain
   compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In
   general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present invention and
   are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.
15 [0071]      As used herein, the term "salt" refers to acid or base salts of the compounds used in the
   methods of the present invention. Illustrative examples of acceptable salts are mineral acid
   (hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, and the like) salts, organic acid (acetic
   acid, propionic acid, glutamic acid, citric acid and the like) salts, quaternary ammonium (methyl
   iodide, ethyl iodide, and the like) salts.
20 [0072]      Certain compounds of the present invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical
   or chiral centers) or double bonds; the enantiomers, racemates, diastereomers, tautomers,
   geometric isomers, stereoisometric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute
   stereochemistry, as (R)-or (S)- or, as (D)- or (L)- for amino acids, and individual isomers are
   encompassed within the scope of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention
25 do not include those which are known in art to be too unstable to synthesize and/or isolate. The
   present invention is meant to include compounds in racemic and optically pure forms. Optically
   active (R)- and (S)-, or (D)- and (L)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral
   reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. When the compounds described herein
   contain olefinic bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise,
30 it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers.
   [0073]      As used herein, the term "isomers" refers to compounds having the same number and
   kind of atoms, and hence the same molecular weight, but differing in respect to the structural
   arrangement or configuration of the atoms.
                                                        18

   [0074]     The term "tautomer," as used herein, refers to one of two or more structural isomers
   which exist in equilibrium and which are readily converted from one isomeric form to another.
   [0075]     It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that certain compounds of this invention may
   exist in tautomeric forms, all such tautomeric forms of the compounds being within the scope of
 5 the invention.
   [0076]     Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include all
   stereochemical forms of the structure; i.e., the R and S configurations for each asymmetric
   center. Therefore, single stereochemical isomers as well as enantiomeric and diastereomeric
   mixtures of the present compounds are within the scope of the invention.
10 [0077]     Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include
   compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For
   example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of a hydrogen by a
   deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by        13
                                                                     C- or 14 C-enriched carbon are within
   the scope of this invention.
15 [0078]     The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of
   atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the
   compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H),
   iodine-125    (1251), or carbon-14 ( 14 C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present
   invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
20 [0079]     The symbol "-"        denotes the point of attachment of a chemical moiety to the
   remainder of a molecule or chemical formula.
   [0080]     The terms "a" or "an," as used in herein means one or more. In addition, the phrase
   "substituted with a[n]," as used herein, means the specified group may be substituted with one or
   more of any or all of the named substituents. For example, where a group, such as an alkyl or
25 heteroaryl group, is "substituted with an unsubstituted CI-C        20 alkyl, or unsubstituted 2 to 20
   membered heteroalkyl," the group may contain one or more unsubstituted CI-C               20 alkyls, and/or
   one or more unsubstituted 2 to 20 membered heteroalkyls. Moreover, where a moiety is
   substituted with an R substituent, the group may be referred to as "R-substituted." Where a
   moiety is R-substituted, the moiety is substituted with at least one R substituent and each R
30 substituent is optionally different.
   [0081]     Descriptions of compounds of the present invention are limited by principles of
   chemical bonding known to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, where a group may be
                                                         19

    WO 2014/124458                                                               PCT/US2014/015863
   substituted by one or more of a number of substituents, such substitutions are selected so as to
   comply with principles of chemical bonding and to give compounds which are not inherently
   unstable and/or would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art as likely to be unstable under
   ambient conditions, such as aqueous, neutral, and several known physiological conditions. For
 5 example, a heterocycloalkyl or heteroaryl is attached to the remainder of the molecule via a ring
   heteroatom in compliance with principles of chemical bonding known to those skilled in the art
   thereby avoiding inherently unstable compounds.
   [0082]    The terms "treating" or "treatment" refers to any indicia of success in the treatment or
   amelioration of an injury, disease, pathology or condition, including any objective or subjective
10 parameter such as abatement; remission; diminishing of symptoms or making the injury,
   pathology or condition more tolerable to the patient; slowing in the rate of degeneration or
   decline; making the final point of degeneration less debilitating; improving a patient's physical
   or mental well-being. The treatment or amelioration of symptoms can be based on objective or
   subjective parameters; including the results of a physical examination, electrocardiogram,
15 echocardiography, radio-imaging, nuclear scan, and/or stress testing, neuropsychiatric exams,
   and/or a psychiatric evaluation. For example, certain methods herein treat a neurodegenerative
   disease or a cardiomyopathy. In embodiments, certain methods herein treat Parkinson's disease
   by decreasing the production of Lewy bodies, decreasing the accumulation of alpha-synuclein,
   decreasing cell death, decreasing loss of dopamine-generating cells, decreasing loss of cells in
20 the substantia nigra, decreasing loss of dopamine production, decreasing a symptom of
   Parkinson's disease, decreasing loss of motor function, decreasing shaking or slowing an
   increase in shaking (tremor), decreasing rigidity or an increase in rigidity, decreasing slowness
   (bradykinesia) of movement or a slowing of movement, decreasing sensory symptoms,
   decreasing insomnia, decreasing sleepiness, increasing mental wellbeing, increasing mental
25 function, slowing the decrease of mental function, decreasing dementia, delaying the onset of
   dementia, improving cognitive skills, decreasing the loss of cognitive skills, improving memory,
   decreasing the degradation of memory, or extending survival. In embodiments, certain methods
   herein treat cardiomyopathy by increasing cardiac performance, improving exercise tolerance,
   preventing heart failure, increasing blood oxygen content, or improving respiratory function.
30 The term "treating" and conjugations thereof, include prevention of an injury, pathology,
   condition, or disease (e.g. preventing the development of one or more symptoms of a
   neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease, or of a cardiomyopathy).
   [0083]    An "effective amount" is an amount sufficient to accomplish a stated purpose (e.g.
   achieve the effect for which it is administered, treat a disease, reduce enzyme activity, increase
                                                     20

    WO 2014/124458                                                               PCT/US2014/015863
   enzyme activity, reduce one or more symptoms of a disease or condition). An example of an
   "effective amount" is an amount sufficient to contribute to the treatment, prevention, or
   reduction of a symptom or symptoms of a disease, which could also be referred to as a
   "therapeutically effective amount." A "reduction" of a symptom or symptoms (and grammatical
 5 equivalents of this phrase) means decreasing of the severity or frequency of the symptom(s), or
   elimination of the symptom(s). A "prophylactically effective amount" of a drug is an amount of
   a drug that, when administered to a subject, will have the intended prophylactic effect, e.g.,
   preventing or delaying the onset (or reoccurrence) of an injury, disease, pathology or condition,
   or reducing the likelihood of the onset (or reoccurrence) of an injury, disease, pathology, or
10 condition, or their symptoms. The full prophylactic effect does not necessarily occur by
   administration of one dose, and may occur only after administration of a series of doses. Thus, a
   prophylactically effective amount may be administered in one or more administrations. The
   exact amounts will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one
   skilled in the art using known techniques (see, e.g., Lieberman, PharmaceuticalDosage Forms
15 (vols. 1-3, 1992); Lloyd, The Art, Science and Technology ofPharmaceuticalCompounding
   (1999); Pickar, Dosage Calculations (1999); and Remington: The Science and Practiceof
   Pharmacy,20th Edition, 2003, Gennaro, Ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins).
   [0084]     The term "associated" or "associated with" in the context of a substance or substance
   activity or function associated with a disease (e.g. a protein associated disease, a symptom
20 associated with a cardiomyopathy, neurodegenerative disease, or symptom associated with
   Parkinson's disease) means that the disease (e.g. cardiomyopathy, neurodegenerative disease or
   Parkinson's disease) is caused by (in whole or in part), or a symptom of the disease is caused by
   (in whole or in part) the substance or substance activity or function. For example, a symptom of
   a disease or condition associated with a reduction in the level of PINK1 activity may be a
25 symptom that results (entirely or partially) from a reduction in the level of PINK1 activity (e.g.
   loss of function mutation or gene deletion or modulation of PINK1 signal transduction pathway).
   As used herein, what is described as being associated with a disease, if a causative agent, could
   be a target for treatment of the disease. For example, a disease associated with PINK1, may be
   treated with an agent (e.g. compound as described herein) effective for increasing the level of
30 activity of PINK1.
   [0085]      "Control" or "control experiment" is used in accordance with its plain ordinary
   meaning and refers to an experiment in which the subjects or reagents of the experiment are
   treated as in a parallel experiment except for omission of a procedure, reagent, or variable of the
                                                     21

   experiment. In some instances, the control is used as a standard of comparison in evaluating
   experimental effects.
   [0086]     "Contacting" is used in accordance with its plain ordinary meaning and refers to the
   process of allowing at least two distinct species (e.g. chemical compounds including
 5 biomolecules, or cells) to become sufficiently proximal to react, interact or physically touch. It
   should be appreciated, however, that the resulting reaction product can be produced directly from
   a reaction between the added reagents or from an intermediate from one or more of the added
   reagents which can be produced in the reaction mixture. The term "contacting" may include
   allowing two species to react, interact, or physically touch, wherein the two species may be a
10 compound as described herein and a protein or enzyme (e.g. PINK1). In embodiments
   contacting includes allowing a compound described herein to interact with a protein or enzyme
   that is involved in a signaling pathway.
   [0087]     As defined herein, the term "inhibition", "inhibit", "inhibiting" and the like in reference
   to a protein-inhibitor (e.g. antagonist) interaction means negatively affecting (e.g. decreasing) the
15 activity or function of the protein relative to the activity or function of the protein in the absence
   of the inhibitor. In embodiments inhibition refers to reduction of a disease or symptoms of
   disease. In embodiments, inhibition refers to a reduction in the activity of a signal transduction
   pathway or signaling pathway. Thus, inhibition includes, at least in part, partially or totally
   blocking stimulation, decreasing, preventing, or delaying activation, or inactivating,
20 desensitizing, or down-regulating signal transduction or enzymatic activity or the amount of a
   protein.
   [0088]     As defined herein, the term "activation", "activate", "activating" and the like in
   reference to a protein-activator (e.g. agonist) interaction means positively affecting (e.g.
   increasing) the activity or function of the protein (e.g. PINK1) relative to the activity or function
25 of the protein in the absence of the activator (e.g. compound described herein). In embodiments,
   activation refers to an increase in the activity of a signal transduction pathway or signaling
   pathway (e.g. PINK1 pathway). Thus, activation may include, at least in part, partially or totally
   increasing stimulation, increasing or enabling activation, or activating, sensitizing, or up
   regulating signal transduction or enzymatic activity or the amount of a protein decreased in a
30 disease (e.g. reduction of the level of PINK1 activity or protein associated with a
   cardiomyopathy or a neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease). Activation may
   include, at least in part, partially or totally increasing stimulation, increasing or enabling
   activation, or activating, sensitizing, or up-regulating signal transduction or enzymatic activity or

   incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes. The compositions of the
   present invention can also be delivered as microspheres for slow release in the body. For
   example, microspheres can be administered via intradermal injection of drug-containing
   microspheres, which slowly release subcutaneously (see Rao, J. Biomater Sci. Polym. Ed. 7:623
25 645, 1995; as biodegradable and injectable gel formulations (see, e.g., Gao Pharm. Res. 12:857
   863, 1995); or, as microspheres for oral administration (see, e.g., Eyles, J. Pharm. Pharmacol.
   49:669-674, 1997). In embodiments, the formulations of the compositions of the present
   invention can be delivered by the use of liposomes which fuse with the cellular membrane or are
   endocytosed, i.e., by employing receptor ligands attached to the liposome, that bind to surface
30 membrane protein receptors of the cell resulting in endocytosis. By using liposomes, particularly
   where the liposome surface carries receptor ligands specific for target cells, or are otherwise
   preferentially directed to a specific organ, one can focus the delivery of the compositions of the
   present invention into the target cells in vivo. (See, e.g., Al-Muhammed, J. Microencapsul.

   [0099]     Pharmaceutical compositions provided by the present invention include compositions
   wherein the active ingredient (e.g. compounds described herein, including embodiments or
 5 examples) is contained in a therapeutically effective amount, i.e., in an amount effective to
   achieve its intended purpose. The actual amount effective for a particular application will
   depend, inter alia, on the condition being treated. When administered in methods to treat a
   disease, such compositions will contain an amount of active ingredient effective to achieve the
   desired result, e.g., modulating the activity of a target molecule (e.g. PINKI), and/or reducing,
10 eliminating, or slowing the progression of disease symptoms (e.g. symptoms of cardiomyopathy
   or a neurodegeneration such as symptoms of Parkinson's disease). Determination of a
   therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention is well within the capabilities of
   those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure herein.
   [0100]     The dosage and frequency (single or multiple doses) administered to a mammal can
15 vary depending upon a variety of factors, for example, whether the mammal suffers from another
   disease, and its route of administration; size, age, sex, health, body weight, body mass index, and
   diet of the recipient; nature and extent of symptoms of the disease being treated (e.g. symptoms
   of cardiomyopathy or neurodegeneration such as Parkinson's disease and severity of such
   symptoms), kind of concurrent treatment, complications from the disease being treated or other
20 health-related problems. Other therapeutic regimens or agents can be used in conjunction with
   the methods and compounds of Applicants' invention. Adjustment and manipulation of
   established dosages (e.g., frequency and duration) are well within the ability of those skilled in
   the art.
   [0101]     For any compound described herein, the therapeutically effective amount can be
25 initially determined from cell culture assays. Target concentrations will be those concentrations
   of active compound(s) that are capable of achieving the methods described herein, as measured
   using the methods described herein or known in the art.
   [0102]     As is well known in the art, therapeutically effective amounts for use in humans can
   also be determined from animal models. For example, a dose for humans can be formulated to
30 achieve a concentration that has been found to be effective in animals. The dosage in humans
   can be adjusted by monitoring compounds effectiveness and adjusting the dosage upwards or
   downwards, as described above. Adjusting the dose to achieve maximal efficacy in humans

   based on the methods described above and other methods is well within the capabilities of the
   ordinarily skilled artisan.
   [0103]     Dosages may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the
   compound being employed. The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present
 5 invention should be sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time.
   The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse
   side-effects. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of
   the practitioner. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the
   optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until
10 the optimum effect under circumstances is reached.
   [0104]     Dosage amounts and intervals can be adjusted individually to provide levels of the
   administered compound effective for the particular clinical indication being treated. This will
   provide a therapeutic regimen that is commensurate with the severity of the individual's disease
   state.
15 [0105]     Utilizing the teachings provided herein, an effective prophylactic or therapeutic
   treatment regimen can be planned that does not cause substantial toxicity and yet is effective to
   treat the clinical symptoms demonstrated by the particular patient. This planning should involve
   the careful choice of active compound by considering factors such as compound potency, relative
   bioavailability, patient body weight, presence and severity of adverse side effects, preferred
20 mode of administration and the toxicity profile of the selected agent.
   [0106]     The compounds described herein can be used in combination with one another, with
   other active agents known to be useful in treating a disease associated neurodegeneration (e.g.
   Parkinson's disease such as levodopa, dopamine agonists (e.g. bromocriptine, pergolide,

25 selegiline or rasagiline), amantadine, anticholinergics, antipsychotics (e.g. clozapine),
   cholinesterase inhibitors, modafinil, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), or with
   adjunctive agents that may not be effective alone, but may contribute to the efficacy of the active
   agent.

   steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), or with adjunctive agents that may not be effective alone, but
 5 may contribute to the efficacy of the active agent.
   [0108]     In embodiments, co-administration includes administering one active agent within 0.5,
   1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, or 24 hours of a second active agent. Co-administration includes
   administering two active agents simultaneously, approximately simultaneously (e.g., within
   about 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 30 minutes of each other), or sequentially in any order. In
10 embodiments, co-administration can be accomplished by co-formulation, i.e., preparing a single
   pharmaceutical composition including both active agents. In other embodiments, the active
   agents can be formulated separately. In embodiments, the active and/or adjunctive agents may
   be linked or conjugated to one another. In embodiments, the compounds described herein may
   be combined with treatments for neurodegeneration such as surgery. In embodiments, the
15 compounds described herein may be combined with treatments for cardiomyopathy such as
   surgery.

   be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction compared to mitochondrial function in the same
   type of cells in a person without the cardiomyopathy. The cardiomyopathy may be associated
   with oxidative stress. The cardiomyopathy may be associated with increased levels of reactive
10 oxygen species in disease associated cells compared to the same type of cells not associated with
   cardiomyopathy (e.g. increased in a patient with a cardiomyopathy compared to control sample
   or person without the cardiomyopathy). The cardiomyopathy may be dilated cardiomyopathy,

   cardiomyopathy, or unclassified cardiomyopathy.
15 IV.     Methods of Increasing Enzymatic Activity
   [0220]    Therapeutic approaches for specifically enhancing the activity of PINK1 have not been
   previously considered because no allosteric regulatory sites for PINK1 are known. Discovered
   herein, inter alia, a neo-substrate involving N6 furfuryl-ATP (kinetin triphosphate or KTP), can
   be used to increase the activity of both mutant PINKlG39D and PINKlWt. Provided herein are

   [0360]    The following examples illustrated various embodiments of the invention are not
15 intended to limit the invention in any way.
   [0361]    In healthy mitochondria, PINK1 is rapidly degraded; but in the presence of inner
   membrane depolarization, PINK1 is stabilized on the outer membrane, where it recruits and
   activates the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, blocks mitochondrial fusion and trafficking, and,

20 [0362]    Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders,
   however no disease modifying therapies are currently approved to treat PD. Both environmental
   and genetic factors are believed to lead to progressive apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons,

   lowered dopamine levels and ultimately PD. One autosomal recessive genetic form is caused by
   mutations in the mitochondrial kinase PTEN Induced Kinase 1 (PINK1). In healthy
   dopaminergic neurons PINK1 opposes apoptosis in response to oxidative stress and
   dopaminergic neurotoxins by halting mitochondrial motility and inducing mitophagy and
 5 clearance of depolarized mitochondria. This neuroprotective effect may be abrogated by PINK1
   PD associated loss of function mutations and by accumulated oxidative stress in sporadic cases.
   PINK1 kinase activity appears to mediate its neuroprotective activity; therefore recovery of the
   kinase activity of mutant PINK1 or activation of the wild-type kinase activity of PINK1 could
   prevent the neurodegeneration associated with PD. Likewise, recovery of the kinase activity of
10 mutant PINK1 or activation of the wild-type kinase activity of PINK1 could prevent the cardiac
   cell degeneration associated with cardiomyopathy.
   [0363]     Regulation of mitochondrial movement, distribution and clearance is a key part of
   neuronal oxidative stress response. Disruptions to these regulatory pathways have been shown to
   contribute to chronic neurodegenerative disease1' 2 . The mitochondrial kinase PINK1 plays a
15 critical role in these processes by regulating the fate of depolarized mitochondria 3 -5.Decreased
   kinase activity in PINKG3091    -mutant neurons is associated with a defect in Parkin recruitment to
   damaged mitochondria and increased levels of neuronal apoptosis, leading to early-onset (-40
   years old) Parkinson's Disease (PD) 6-8. The importance of mitochondrial quality control for
   neuron health and survival is well established1'2,9. The mitochondrial kinase PTEN Induced
20 Kinase 1 (PINK1) plays an important role in these quality control processes by responding to
   damage at the level of individual mitochondria. In healthy mitochondria, PINK1 is rapidly
   degraded; but in the presence of inner membrane depolarization, PINK1 is stabilized on the outer
   membrane, where it recruits and activates the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, blocks mitochondrial
   fusion and trafficking, and, ultimately, triggers mitochondrial autophagy3- 58' 10

25 pathway has also been linked to the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis, and, critically, the
   reduction of mitochondrially induced apoptosis 3'4 11 ' . The PINKl/Parkin pathway has been
   implicated in several autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson's Disease (PD)6' 1. PINK1 loss-of
   function mutations block the neuroprotective effect of PINK1 expression and in homozygous

                    1.     Alternate Substrates of PINK1
   [0365]     Mammalian cells regulate oxidative stress by modulating mitochondrial movement,
   distribution and clearance. The mitochondrial kinase, PINK1 plays a critical role in these
20 processes by regulating clearance of depolarized mitochondria, 2 . Decreased kinase activity in
   PINKl1309D mutant neurons is associated with an autosomal recessive form of Parkinson's
   Disease (PD). Therapeutic approaches for specifically enhancing the activity of PINK1 have not
   been considered since no allosteric regulatory sites for PINK1 are known. Here we show that an
   alternative strategy, a neo-substrate approach involving N6 furfuryl-ATP (kinetin triphosphate or
25 KTP), can be used to increase the activity of both mutant PINKl G309D and PINKlI.           Application
   of the neo-substrate to oxidatively stressed cells results in higher levels of Parkin recruitment,
   reduced mitochondrial motility, and lower levels of apoptosis in a PINK1 dependent manner in
   cellular models. These results suggest a potential therapeutic opportunity for treating genetic
   G309D and idiopathic forms of Parkinson's disease. These results also suggest a potential
30 therapeutic opportunity for treating genetic G309D and idiopathic forms of cardiomyopathy.
   Discovery of neo-substrates for kinases whose loss of function mediate disease provides a
   heretofore unappreciated therapeutic modality for targeting such diseases.
   [0366]     Recognizing the therapeutic potential of PINKl/Parkin pathway activation and/or
   amplification, we began investigating chemical-genetic mechanisms for manipulating PINKl.
                                                     93

    WO 2014/124458                                                                 PCT/US2014/015863
   Since no PINK1 allosteric regulatory sites have yet been discovered, we chose to pursue a
   strategy of looking for alternative substrates for both PINKlIand the disease associated
   PINKlG09 mutant. Recent work showed in cells expressing hypomorphic mutant CDK2 alleles
   that the activity of CDK2 could be increased by providing nucleotide analogs which fit into the
 5 hypomorphic CDK2 . Comparison of the sequence of PINK1 to kinases for which structural
   data is available revealed large insertions in several regions of the n-lobe of the PINK1 kinase
   domain surrounding the ATP binding site (Fig. 5A). 18 These insertions suggested that the active
   site of PINK1 might accommodate alternative nucleotide substrates besides ATP. Though it is
   uncommon for eukaryotic protein kinases to accept alternative substrates in the ATP binding site,
10 kinases engineered with gatekeeper mutations tolerate substitutions to ATP at the N6 position.
   Additionally, prominent examples exist for naturally occurring kinases. CK2, for example,
   accepts ATP as well as GTP.
   [0367]     We expressed both PINKlw and PINK         G309D GST tagged kinase domain (15 6-4 9 6PINK1)
   in E. coli and performed kinase assays with a series of ATP analogs. As expected, PINKlG309D
15 displayed reduced activity with ATP; interestingly, however, incubation with N 6 furfuryl ATP
   (kinetin triphosphate or KTP) led to increased levels of autophosphorylation (Fig. 1D, 1F, and
   Fig. 6B, 6C). Using a capture and release strategy pioneered by our lab19' 20 , we were able to
   identify the T257 autophosphorylation site     using KTP as the phospho-donor for PINKl(Fig.
   1E), which showed that this neo-substrate is utilized similarly to ATP. To assess
20 transphosphorylation, we incubated the kinase domain of PINKlG309D and PINKl" (Fig. 1B)
   with KTP and a substrate protein (TRAP 1), and found that the activity of both PINK1 constructs
   was amplified by using the neo-substrate KTP versus ATP.
   [0368]     Experiments to determine whether the N6 furfuryl adenine analogs cross the SH-SY5Y
   plasma membrane and are incorporated into ATP analogs using TLC were conducted. We
25 confirmed presence of a membrane impermeable metabolite after incubation with N6 furfuryl
   adenine. We included negative control analogs of Kinetin which prevent metabolism.
   [0369]     Experiments were conducted to test whether the rescue of PINK1 ATP dependent
   kinase activity also increases the survival of cells in the face of stress agents. Pre-treatment with
   kinetin but not adenine blocks apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells.

    WO 2014/124458                                                              PCT/US2014/015863
   extension (PINK1, residues 148-58 1) with a C-terminal FLAG 3 tag was co-expressed with full
   length TRAP 1 baculovirus/S21 insect cell system. Following lysis, PINK1 14 s 5 ssi kinase was
   purified using magnetic M2 FLAG affinity resin (Sigma) with the kinase reaction performed on
   beads after no more than 2 hours following lysis. The reaction was performed using 50 mM Tris
 5 HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 3 mM MnCl 2 , 0.5 mM DTT and 1 mg/ml substrate if
   indicated.
   [0371]      To confirm the PINKl-dependency of the observed kinase activity we took several
   steps to optimize PINK1 expression. We constructed several FLAG 3 tagged truncation variants
   of PINK1 and induced expression using baculovirus infected SF21 insect cells. C-terminally
10 tagged   148_581 PINKlFLAG 3 expressed the most soluble protein (Fig. IC). However, PINK1 is
   intrinsically very unstable and there was a very low amount of purified PINK12.
   Hypothesizing that co-expression of interacting proteins might help PINK1 to fold properly, we
   co-expressed proteins known to associate with PINK1 such as DJ-1, PARKIN, and TRAP 1.
   TRAP 1, a mitochondrial chaperone, proved to have a major effect on the stability of PINK1 (Fig.
15  IC). This finding enabled us to express larger amounts of properly folded PINKlw, PINKlG309D
   and a triple kinase dead PINKl       (residues 148-581 with K219A, D362A, and D384A). In line
   with our initial observations, SF21 expressed PINK1 activity is also amplified using KTP. In
   order to confirm that the observed phosphorylation activity derived from PINK1 and not a
   contaminating kinase we confirmed that PINKlkddd had no activity (Fig. IF, and Fig. 6A), and
20 were able to show that PINK1 could also autophosphorylate at a 1.84 fold higher Vmax with the
   neosubstrate KTP versus ATP (Table 1). Additionally we generated KTP with a y 32P labeled
   phosphate, and were able to see increased transphosphorylation of TRAP 1 (Fig 6C). SF21
   expressed PINK1 also utilizes the N6 FF ATP but not N6 Benzyl or N6 Phenethyl ATP as well to
   phosphorylate TRAP 1. We confirmed that kdddPINK1 had no activity and were able to show
25 that PINK1 could also autophosphorylate with a higher catalytic rate using the xeno- substrate N6
   FF ATP. PINK1 utilizes N FF ATP with a 1.84 fold higher Vmax than ATP (Table 1). This is
   probably due to the higher Km observed for N FF ATP (51.7pM) over ATP (18.4pM) as the
   release of ADP is the rate-limiting step in phosphate hydrolysis. Using a capture and release
   strategy pioneered by our lab, we were able to identify the T257 autophosphorylation site that
30 was recently reported using N 6 FF ATPyS as a substrate.
   [0372]      We expressed GST tagged kinase domain (PINK 1156 _496) in e.coli and performed a
   kinase assay. We saw that wtPINK1 was able to utilize ATP to phosphorylate a substrate protein
   TRAP 1, and surprisingly also to utilize the N 6 Furfuryl ATP analog. To test the catalytic
   efficiency with these analogs, we incubated wtPINKl 156-496 and G309DPINKl 156-496 with N6 FF
                                                     95

    WO 2014/124458                                                               PCT/US2014/015863
   ATP and a substrate protein TRAP 1, and found that PINK1 appeared to use the N6 FF ATP
   analog more efficiently than ATP. In fact PD associated G309D mutant PINK1 that retains some
   kinase activity was also able to use this modified ATP analog with an increased catalytic rate
   than ATP. Taken together, these data suggest the ability to activate PINK1 by using this xeno
 5 substrate as an alternative to ATP.
                     3.      Co-localization and Phosphorylation Assays
   [0373]      Parkin phosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation assay: HeLa cells were grown
   in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Log phase cells were plated in 24 well plates with glass
   coverslips (Mattek) pretreated with fibronectin. Cells were pretreated with 50 PM of the
10 indicated compound, followed by transfection with MitoGFP, mCherry Parkin, and full length
   PINKlFLAG 3 in a 1:4:2 ratio using Fugene 6 (Promega). Fields of cells were selected by
   expression of MitoGFP (6 fields/well-3 wells/condition) and imaged at five-minute intervals
   following depolarization with 5 pM CCCP. Quantification was performed according to
   published protocols 3 and by creation of a Matlab based script.
15 [0374]      Our ability to enhance PINK1 activity in-vitro using KTP led us to investigate means
   by which to achieve enhanced activity in cells expressing PINKl. ATP analogs are not
   membrane permeable; however, previous work has shown that cytokinins like kinetin
   (nucleobase precursor to KTP) can be taken up by human cells and converted to the
   triphosphorylated form24 . We treated cells with either kinetin or adenine (Fig. 2A) and measured
20 Parkin localization following mitochondrial depolarization with CCCP (Fig. 2B). HeLa cells,
   which have low levels of endogenous PINK1 and PARKIN, were transfected with wildtype or
            G309D                        mtGP       fe
   PINKl          , mCherryParkin, and mitoGFP. After 48 hours of incubation with 25 pM adenine,
   kinetin or equivalent DMSO, we imaged CCCP-mediated depolarization of mitochondria (Fig.
   2C, 2D) and calculated the percentage of GFP labelled mitochondria with mCherryParkin
                                                         3                        1309D
25 associated (Fig. 2E). ). In line with previous reports , transfection of PINKlG      slowed the 50%
   recruitment (R 50 ) time of mCherryParkin to depolarized mitochondria (232min vs 15+1min
   R 50 ) (Fig. 2C-2E Table.2). The addition of kinetin, but not adenine, increased the R50 for
   mCherryParkin PINKl G309D cells from 23+2 to 15+2min and surprisingly also increased the R 50
   for PINKl" cells from 15+1 to 102min (Fig. 2E). Using an algorithm to accurately quantify the
30 time dependent change in co-localization, we calculated that PINKl' expressing cells achieved a
   mean change in co-localization of 0.112 with DMSO or adenine and 0.13 with kinetin treatment
   (Fig. 7); PINKlG309D expressing cells treated with DMSO or adenine achieved delta co
   localization of 0.076, but upon addition of kinetin returned to near-PINKl-wildtype levels
                                                      96

    WO 2014/124458                                                               PCT/US2014/015863
   (0.124). These results suggested near-complete rescue of PINKlG3 09 D activity using kinetin.
   Two-way ANOVA analysis revealed that kinetin has an effect in both cases (wt; F=24. 10
   p<0.0001, G309D; F=54.14, p<0.000 1). Importantly, N6 benzyl adenine, which was not as
   active in-vitro, is also less active than kinetin in cells (Fig. 8)
 5 [0375]    To test the PINKl-dependency of our findings, we assayed PINK1 activity by using
   phospho specific antibodies raised against Parkin's PINKl-specific S65 phosphosite2 1 after
   immuno-precipitating Parkin. We observed a robust increase in the phosphorylation levels of
   Parkin following CCCP treatment in a PINK1-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). In a finding that
   supported our earlier co-localization results, we also found that the addition of neo-substrate
10 kinetin (p=0.04; t-test), but not adenine (p=O. 1875; t-test), to PINKl G309D mutant expressing cells
   significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of Parkin (Fig. 2G). The addition of an
   adenosine kinase inhibitor (AKI) blocking the conversion of kinetin to KTP prevented this effect
   (p=0.3701;t-test) (Fig. 2G, and Fig. 7A). To test whether kinetin stimulated Parkin localization
   was due to reversible binding of kinetin to PINK1, we treated the cells with fresh medium for 96
15 hours before performing a new recruitment assay. Similar recruitment rates were observed
   following the washout (Fig. 2F). These data suggest the buildup of a membrane impermeable
   metabolite like KTP that activates PINK1 in cells. We followed previously published methods
   to calculate the percentage of GFP labeled mitochondria with mCherryParkin associated.
   Transfection of G309DPINKlII5 81 slowed the rate of mCherryParkin recruitment (23+2min vs
20 15+1min R50) as per reported results. The addition of kinetin, but not adenine, increased the rate
   of mCherryParkin recruitment in wt cells from 15+1 to 10+2min and G309D cells from 23+2 to
   15+2min. We then incubated the cells with kinetin for 2 days, washed the cells with fresh
   medium then performed the recruitment assay and saw the same increase in the rate of
   recruitment. This suggests the buildup of a membrane impermeable metabolite that can activate
25 PINK1 in cells. We developed an algorithm to calculate the change in co-localization. The
   wtPINK1 cells achieved a mean change in co-localization of 0.11 with DMSO, adenine or
   kinetin treatment. G309DPINK1 expressing cells treated with DMSO or Adenine, achieved
   delta co-localization of 0.075 but upon addition of kinetin indicating rescue to the wt level (0.11)
   (P>0.05). These data suggest the activation of PINK1 by utilization of an introduced xeno
30 substrate in mamallian cells.
                    4.      Mitochondrial Motility, Cell Survival, and Apoptosis
   [0376]    Mitochondrial motility assay: Primary hippocampal neuronal cultures were co
   transfected with mitochondrial targeted GFP (mitoGFP) and mCherry-tagged synaptophysin
   (mCherrySynaptophysin) to allow for the live identification of mitochondria in axons. Cells were

   pre-treated for 48 hours with 50 pM Kinetin, adenine or equivalent DMSO and mitochondrial
   motility was imaged live and kymographs were generated (Fig. 3A) using approaches similar to
   those described previously 4 .
   [0377]     Apoptosis assays and PINK 1 shRNA: SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC) were cultured in 1:1
 5 mix of F 12K and DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS. PINK1 shRNA lentivirus were produced
   using a pLKO. 1 based shRNA (Sigma) by contransfection with A8.9 and pMGD2 vectors in
   HEK293T cells. SH-SY5Y cells were infected with lentivirus followed by selection with
   puromycin (0.5 mg/ml). The indicated cells were plated in 6-well plates at about 500,000
   cells/well, pretreated with 50 pM of the indicated drug or DMSO for 96 hours followed by 400
10 pM H 2 0 2 treatment. Subsequently, cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI and analyzed
   (FACS Diva) on a FACS LSRII Cytometer (Beckman Coulter) Apoptosis was calculated as the
   difference between H2 0 2 treated samples and the respective control.
   [0378]     Overexpression of PINK1 in primary neurons leads to loss of mitochondrial trafficking
   in axons. These effects appear to precede any PINK1 effect on mitophagy, and depend on PINK1
15 phosphorylation of Miro4 . To test if kinetin decreases motility we examined the mobility of
   axonal mitochondria in hippocampal neurons. Primary hippocampal neuronal cultures were co
   transfected with mitoGFP and mCherry-tagged Synaptophysin (mCherrySynaptophysin) to allow
   for the live identification of mitochondria in axons. Cells were pre-treated for 48 hours with 50
   pM Kinetin, adenine, or equivalent DMSO, and mitochondrial motility was imaged live and
20 kymographs were generated (Fig. 3A-3D) using approaches similar to those described
   previously4 . We found that kinetin potently and specifically inhibited mitochondrial movement
   (p=0.0005;t-test)(Fig. 3E-3F) in rat hippocampal neurons. In contrast, kinetin analog 9-methyl
   Kinetin (9MK)(Fig. 3A, 3D, 3F), which cannot be converted to a tri-phospho form, did not affect
   mitochondrial motility(p=0.86;t-test). Kinetin also has an effect on velocity of mitochondria that
25 remain in motion (p=0.03;t-test), and this reflects a decrease in the velocity of mitochondria in
   the retrograde direction (p=0.0026;t-test) not in the anterograde direction (p=0.3644;t-test)(Fig.
   1OA), suggesting that the velocity of damaged mitochondria in the direction of the nucleus is
   modified. To test the PINK1 dependency of this process, we treated control mouse C57 (PINK1
   wildtype) and PINK1 knockout derived hippocampal neurons with kinetin or 9MK and imaged
30 their mitochondria. Similar to rat derived neurons, we observed a significant (p<0.0001;t-test)
   decrease in motility in C57 derived neurons, but no change in motility when PINK1-/- derived
   neurons were treated with kinetin (Fig. 3H) (p=0.64;t-test) or 9MK. These data suggest that
   kinetin can block mitochondrial motility in a PINK1 dependent manner and that the metabolism
   of kinetin to KTP is necessary and sufficient for this effect.

   [0379]     Overexpression of PINK1 in neuronal cells (e.g. dopaminergic (DA)) promotes
   survival in response to oxidative stress and other mitochondrial toxins7 . Before testing the effects
   of kinetin on apoptosis, we treated DA neurons with 50 pM of either kinetin or adenine and
   measured cell density after 10 days. Kinetin and adenine have no effect on cell density,
 5 indicating both are non-toxic to DA neurons (Fig. 4A). To determine whether amplification of
   PINK1 kinase activity by KTP in cells promotes survival, we utilized human-derived
   neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells which exhibit decreased apoptosis upon overexpression of
   PINK1 7. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 50 pM kinetin, adenine or DMSO for 96 hours,
   followed by 400 pM H 20 2 treatment for additional 24 hours. Using a cytometry-based FACS
10 assay involving cellular annexin V and propidium iodide staining, we determined the percentage
   of apoptotic cells after treatment with DMSO, adenine or kinetin. We saw a significant decrease
   in the total amount of apoptotic cells following kinetin treatment (Fig. 4E) DMSO vs kinetin
   p=0.008;Wilcoxon T test), but no significant change with adenine (DMSO vs adenine,
   p=0.48;Wilcoxon T test) and no kinetin effect with infection of a lentivirus expressing PINKl
15 silencing shRNA (Fig. 4C, 4E) (DMSO vs kinetin, p=0.23;Wilcoxon T test). These data suggest
   that PINK1 is activated by kinetin, and that its presence is required to mediate the anti-apoptotic
   effects of kinetin.
                    5.     Experimental Analysis
   [0380]     Our investigation of a neo-substrate approach to modulate PINK1 activity have yielded
20 three significant findings: 1) the ATP analog kinetin triphosphate (KTP) can be used by both
   PINKlG309D and PINKlwt ; 2) KTP amplifies both PINKlG 3 09 Dand PINKlI           activity, and in the
   case of the former, returns it to near-wt catalytic efficiency; 3) kinetin can be applied to neuronal
   cell cultures to reduce apoptosis in a PINK1-dependent manner.
   [0381]     Current kinase targeted drugs are striking for the single modality of regulating kinase
25 function-inhibition. However, a wide range of kinase dysregulation in disease is characterized
   by a lack of kinase activity: desensitization of insulin receptor kinase in diabetes ; inactivation
   of the death associated protein kinase (DAPK) in cancer 2 6; inactivation of the LKB1 tumor
   suppressor kinase in cancer 27; and decreased PINK1 activity in early-onset Parkinson's Disease.
   Although many examples of inactive kinases causing disease have been uncovered, there have
30 been no therapeutic approaches for enhancing kinase activity. We show here that kinetin can be
   used to rescue PINKlG309D catalytic activity to near-wt levels in-vitro and in cells, and that wt
   PINK1 can be amplified to halt mitochondrial motility and to oppose apoptosis in the presence of
   oxidative stress. These data suggest that kinetin mediated activation of PINK1 may be a potential
   therapeutic for PINKl-related and possibly even idiopathic Parkinson's Disease. As Parkinson's
                                                      99

   Disease has heretofore lacked any disease modifying therapies, kinetin-induced amplification of
   the PINK1 pathway could prove the first disease modifying therapy for PD. Additionally, our
   insights into the kinase-dependent alternative use of neo-substrates may presage the ability to
   treat other diseases resulting from kinase misregulation with a novel class of neo-substrate kinase
 5 activators.

                           cardiomyocytes in models for heart disease
   [0384]     Mitochondria constitute 30% of myocardial mass, therefore normal mechanisms of
   mitochondrial repair are essential for cardiac homeostasis (Chen et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012).
15 PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) plays an important role in repairing mitochondrial
   dysfunction by responding to damage at the level of individual mitochondria. In healthy
   mitochondria, PINK1 is rapidly degraded by the protease ParL (Meissner et al., 2011); but in the
   presence of inner membrane depolarization, PINK1 is stabilized on the outer membrane, where it
   recruits and activates Parkin (Narendra et al., 2010), blocks mitochondrial fusion and trafficking
20 (Clark et al., 2006; Deng et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011), and ultimately triggers mitochondrial
   autophagy (Geisler et al., 2010; Narendra et al., 2008; Youle and Narendra, 2011). The PINK1
   pathway has also been linked to the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and the reduction of
   apoptosis in neurons (Deng et al., 2005; Petit et al., 2005; Pridgeon et al., 2007; Shin et al., 2011;

    WO 2014/124458                                                              PCT/US2014/015863
   Wang et al., 2011). This important pathway for neuronal mitochondrial health and cell survival
   has only recently been connected with cardiac mitochondrial maintenance and survival.
   [0385]    PINK1 is expressed downstream of the pro-growth PI3K/Akt pathway, which is
   associated with reduced myocardial infarction, therefore early research sought to connect PINK1
 5 to cardiac survival (Siddall et al., 2008). This connection was strengthened by the discovery that
   PINK1 expression is severely reduced in end stage human heart failure and that PINK1 knockout
   mice show impaired cardiac mitochondrial function and pathological cardiac hypertrophy at an
   early age (2 months of age)(Billia et al., 2011). Thus, PINK1 related protein Parkin appears
   essential for normal mitochondrial survival in cardiac myocytes and that PINK1 expression
10 opposes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Lee et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012).
   [0386]    PINK1, Parkin and mitochondrial health are connected to maintenance in cardiac
   tissue. The mitochondrial outer membrane guanosine triphosphatase mitofusin (Mfn) 2 is likely
   directly phosphorylated by PINK1 following mitochondrial depolarization. The phosphorylated
   form of Mfn2 likely serves as the receptor for Parkin on depolarized mitochondria, leading to
15 Parkin activation and mitophagy (Chen and Dorn, 2013). The knockout of Mfn2 in mice causes
   defective mitophagy in heart tissue, impaired 02 consumption and significantly impaired
   contractile performance in the left ventricle (LV), all of which phenocopy characteristics of
   aging hearts. In agreement with these data, Drosophila lacking Parkin exhibited impaired
   respiration in heart tubes, contractile impairment in the LV and cardiomyocyte mitochondria
20 were enlarged all characteristics of dilated cardiomyopathy (Chen and Dorn, 2013). Indeed,
   PINKI appears to play an important role in kinase activity in normal heart function in mice and
   zebrafish (Priyadarshini et al., 2013; Siddall et al., 2013). Amplification of PINKI kinase
   activity could prove to have a potential therapeutic role in preventing cardiac dysfunction.
   [0387]    Recognizing the therapeutic potential of PINKl/Parkin pathway activation,
25 mechanisms were investigated for the pharmacological activation of PINKl. Discovered herein,
   the sequence of PINKI has three insertions in PINKI's adenine binding N-terminal subdomain.
   These insertions led us to believe that PINK1 might also exhibit altered substrate specificity.
   Though it is uncommon for eukaryotic protein kinases to accept alternative substrates in the ATP
   binding site, kinases engineered with a single mutation to the gatekeeper residue often tolerate
30 ATP analogs with substitutions at the N6 position (Liu et al., 1998; Shah et al., 1997).
   Importantly, no wildtype kinase we had previously studied had shown the ability to accept N6
   modified ATP analogs.

   [0388]      We discovered that, unlike any kinase we have studied, PINK1 accepts the neo
   substrate N6 furfuryl ATP (kinetin triphosphate or KTP) with higher catalytic efficiency than its
   endogenous substrate, ATP. We also discovered herein that the metabolic precursor of this neo
   substrate (kinetin) can be taken up by cells and converted to the nucleotide triphosphate form,
 5 which leads to accelerated Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria, diminished
   mitochondrial motility in axons, and suppression of apoptosis in human derived neural cells, all
   in a PINKI1 dependent manner. We believe that the fact that PINKI1 can be activated in neural
   cells could portend a role for our small molecule in modulating PINKI kinase activity in a
   cardiac model.
10 [0389]      Example 6.1: Characterize amplification of PINK1 kinase activity in cardiomyocyte
   cell lines.
   [0390]      Kinetin mediated PINKI activity amplification was characterized using a variety of cell
   lines and primary cells. The HL-1 cell line, an established cardiomyocyte cell line that retains
   characteristic properties of differentiated cardiac tissue (Claycomb et al., 1998) as well as freshly
15 isolated cardiomyocytes from PINKI wt or PINK-/- mice. Infected HL-1 cells with a lentivirus
   expressing shRNA targeting PINK1, were developed to generate a PINK1 knockdown control.
   To analyze the amplification of PINKI kinase activity we analyzed the phosphorylation level of
   Bcl-xL, Mfn2, and Parkin following treatment of PINKlwt and PINK1 knockdown or -/- cell
   lines with DMSO or 25 pM adenine, kinetin or 9-methyl kinetin (9MK negative control) and
20 fCCCP for three to twenty-four hours following published protocols (Arena et al., 2013; Chen
   and Dorn, 2013; Kondapalli et al., 2012). Neuronal cell lines treated with kinetin result in a
   significant increase in phosphorylation level of Parkin and Bcl-xL. Accordingly, PINKlwt
   expressing cells see an increase in PINKI dependent phosphorylation, but not in those cells
   where PINK1 has been depleted.
25 [0391]      PINKlIwt and PINK 1 knockdown or -/- cell lines were treated with DMSO or 25 PM
   adenine, kinetin or 9MK and assess characteristics of mitochondrial health following treatment
   with the mitochondrial toxins antimycin, fCCCP, and H202. The health of the mitochondria was
   assessed using established techniques, including mitochondria fluorophore JC-1 staining (Lin
   and Lai, 2013; Lin et al., 2013), mtDNA abundance and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
30 potential (Billia et al., 2011). Decreased mitochondrial health in the PINK1 knockdown or
   derived cell lines compared to PINKlwt cells in all conditions was measured.
   [0392]      Additionally, results were obtained with regard to kinetin treatment in which PINK1
   expression blocks apoptosis of cardiomyocyte cell lines. The amount of early apoptosis was
                                                     102

    WO 2014/124458                                                              PCT/US2014/015863
   measured using caspase 3/7 cleavage activity and later stage apoptosis by measuring the number
   of Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells and
   Annexin V binding by FACS analysis following treatment with mitochondrial toxins. The
   amount of decrease in apoptosis for PINKlwt expressing cells was compared to the PINK1
 5 knockdown cells. Upon kinetin treatment, PINKlwt HL-1 cells or cardiomyocytes derived from
   PINKlwt mice exhibit significantly lower levels than either PINKlwt treated with control
   compounds, or PINK1 knockdown or -/- cells treated with any compound. These results
   replicate the results herein with respect to neurons in which kinetin treatment reduces apoptosis
   in a PINK1 dependent manner.
10 [0393]    Example 6.2: Characterize amplification of PINK1 kinase activity in animal models of
   heart failure.
   [0394]    PINK1 expression is protective in several mouse models of heart failure. PINKlwt
   expression will block pathological hypertrophy, increase heart fractional shortening, and prevent
   ischemia induced death of heart tissue. To assay the effect of kinetin PINKlwt or PINKl-/
15 mice were treated with vehicle, adenine or kinetin from birth following published protocols for
   administration of kinetin (Hims et al., 2007; Shetty et al., 2011). The mice were sacrificed and
   whole hearts analyzed, and isolated cardiomyocytes from mice at appropriate time periods (e.g. 2
   and 6 months). 02 consumption, mitochondrial integrity (mtDNA abundance, mitochondrial
   capacity and JC-1 fluorescence) caspase 3/7 cleavage activity and TUNEL staining were
20 measured to assess the health of these tissues. According to published results (Billia et al., 2011;
   Chen and Dorn, 2013), PINK1 activity is essential for normal 02 consumption and maintenance
   of mitochondrial integrity. Decreased 02 consumption and mitochondrial integrity in PINKl-/
   mice was compared to PINKlwt mice. Improved values for the PINKlwt mice treated with
   kinetin demonstrated improved health. Additionally, caspase 3/7 cleavage activity and TUNEL
25 staining of the left ventricle were increased in PINKl-/- mice derived cardiomyocytes compared
   to PINKlwt. Kinetin treated mice demonstrated further reduced TUNEL staining and thus
   apoptosis replicating our results from neurons in which kinetin blocked induction of apoptosis.
   [0395]    In addition to these analyses we analyzed the performance of the heart in whole
   animals. We utilized the same procedure as above and treated either PINKlwt or PINKl-/
30 mice with vehicle, adenine or kinetin from birth following published protocols for administration
   of kinetin (Hims et al., 2007; Shetty et al., 2011). PINKl-/- mice have been shown to display
   pathological hypertrophy, including increased cross sectional area and total extracellular matrix
   area, fractional shortening and increased oxidative stress. We measured the heart weight:body
                                                     103

    WO 2014/124458                                                                 PCT/US2014/015863
   weight (HBW) ratio and total cross sectional area and total extracellular matrix which increased
   significantly in PINKl-/- mice in an age dependent manner. These characteristics of
   pathological hypertrophy indicate heart failure in the PINKl-/- mice will not increase as
   dramatically in PINKlwt mice (Billia et al., 2011). Treatment with kinetin reduces this age
 5 induced pathological hypertrophy in PINKlwt mice but treatment with adenine or kinetin in
   PINKl-/- mice have no effect. Fractional shortening, as measured by non-invasive
   echocardiography, becomes significantly lower in PINKl-/- mice indicating reduced capacity,
   but not in PINKlwt mice. Six month old PINK lwt mice treated with kinetin exhibit still higher
   fractional shortening than the PINKlwt treated with adenine or PINKl-/- mice treated with
10 adenine or kinetin. These experiments indicate that amplification of PINK1 activity by treatment
   with kinetin can block age-induced loss in heart function.
   [0396]     Stress on the heart also induces pathological hypertrophy and increased apoptosis, and
   serves as a good model for heart disease. We utilized trans-aortic banding (TAB) and treatment
   with angiotensin II to increase pressure in the heart and a model for heart attack by induced
15 myocardial infarction. We treated mice as above with kinetin as well as adenine and vehicle
   controls for two weeks. We then increased pressure in the heart by performing surgery to
   partially occlude the aorta (TAB) or sham operation. Additionally we directly injected of a bolus
   of Angiotensin II or saline into the heart (Billia et al., 2011) to increase blood pressure.
   Following treatment for 14 days we measured HBW ratio, total cross sectional area and total
20 extracellular matrix which increased significantly in PINKl-/- mice following stress (Billia et
   al., 2011). The PINKlwt expressing mice have reduced defects and the addition of kinetin but
   not adenine reduces the pathological hypertrophy as measured. Additionally we analyzed the left
   ventricle for TUNEL staining where the addition of kinetin reduced the total number of TUNEL
   positive cells, but only in the PINK lwt background, not in PINKl I-/- mice. As the depletion of
25 PINK1 leads to more pathological hypertrophy and increased apoptosis, by amplifying PINK1
   activity these characteristics of heart failure will be further reduced.
   [0397]     Utilizing mice dosed with kinetin, adenine or vehicle for two weeks, we induced
   myocardial infarction by ligating the left anterior descending artery at the level of the left atrial
   appendage (Wang et al., 2006) or sham surgery. Following infarct for 24 or 72 hours, we
30 sacrificed the mice and analyzed the heart by TUNEL staining as cardiomyocytes are susceptible
   to cell death following infarct. Significant increase in the percentage of TUNEL positive nuclei
   in the peri-infarct area in PINKl-/- mice over PINKlwt mice is shown, and a significant
   decrease in TUNEL positive cells in PINKlwt mice treated with kinetin is demonstrated. A
   significant decrease in the scar size and the level of collagen deposition, which indicates post
                                                      104

   infarct remodelling, in the heart of the kinetin treated PINKlwt mice, but not in the adenine or
   kinetin treated PINKl-/- mice is deomsntrated. These experiments replicate our results in
   neurons in which kinetin treatment will block apoptosis in response to a number of cellular
   stressors.
