   APPLIANCE FOR TREATING A TEXTILE AND METHOD OF TREATING A TEXTILE
   TECHNICAL FIELD
   The present invention relates to an appliance for treating a textile, and a method of
 5 treating a textile.
   BACKGROUND
   Textiles, such as garments, may be wrinkled. Wrinkles may be removed by ironing with
   an iron. A different approach for removing wrinkles from textiles is by means of a
10 steamer. A steamer may be used for touching up garments prior to use of the garments.
   In a steamer, steam is produced and the steam is emitted from the steamer onto a
   textile. A user directs the steamer, or a part thereof, along a textile to be treated.
   When ironing, steam may be utilized to improve removal of wrinkles. For instance FR
15 2764912 discloses an iron comprising an electric heating element and a system for
   generating a flow of hot air into which atomized water is injected. Water droplets
   evaporate and form steam before they reach a textile being ironed. However, ironing is
   based on the use of a heated sole plate being pressed against a textile placed on an
   ironing board, which is a different method of removing wrinkles from a textile than
20 steaming by means of a steamer.
   US 3620055 discloses a hand-held portable steamer comprising a head portion with a
   handle, a sole plate, with steam ports, forming one wall of the head portion. A pump has
   a manual operating button extending from the handle. Water is transferred from a
25 reservoir in the head portion to an electric flash boiler from which steam passes to the
   ports.
   DE 202004014412 Ul discloses a steam supply unit for care of textiles, comprising a
   nozzle carrier formed as a pipe with second outlet nozzles, which are arranged side by
30 side in the longitudinal direction of the pipe.

   In the field of textile care, there is a desire to provide alternative appliances and/or
   methods for treating a textile, e.g. in order to remove wrinkles from the textile.
   SUMMARY
 5 An object of the present invention relates to an appliance for treating a textile which
   provides at least a reduction of wrinkles in the textile.
   According to an aspect of the invention, the object is achieved by an appliance for
   treating a textile. The appliance comprises a textile contact surface adapted to interact
10 with the textile to be treated. The appliance comprises an airflow generating device and
   a first outlet connected to the airflow generating device. The first outlet is arranged
   adjacent to the textile contact surface, and the first outlet is arranged to direct an airflow
   through the first outlet in an airflow direction. The airflow direction is directed away from
   a normal of the textile contact surface.
15
   Since the first outlet is arranged to direct an airflow in a direction away from a normal of
   the textile contact surface, in use, an airflow is directed along a textile to be treated to
   engage the textile to abut against, or at least be positioned adjacent to, the textile
   contact surface. Thus, the textile is stretched by the airflow engaging with the textile. The
20 stretching of the textile brings about a drawing out of the wrinkles, which improves a
   wrinkle removing operation. As a result, the above mentioned object is achieved.
   The appliance may be used for stretching of textiles such as garments, e.g. for reduction
   or removal of wrinkles. The appliance may be used for hanging garments. The appliance
25 may be a domestic appliance, a public appliance, or a commercially used appliance. The
   airflow generating device is arranged to produce an airflow. The airflow exits the
   appliance via the first outlet. The airflow generating device may be any suitable device
   such as e.g., a fan or a compressor. A textile to be treated may be brought to abut
   against, and even adhere to, the textile contact surface of the appliance by means of the
30 airflow. The textile to be treated may be wet, or damp e.g. from a washing operation, a
   wetting operation, or a steaming operation. Thus, an improved removal of wrinkles from
   the textile to be treated by stretching the textile to be treated by means of the airflow may
                                                     2

   WO 2013/164275                                                                  PCTIEP2013/058773
   be achieved compared to if the textile to be treated is dry. The airflow may also dry such
   a wet or damp textile to be treated.
   According to embodiments, the appliance may comprise a steam producing unit for
 5 producing steam from water, and a directing arrangement for directing steam produced
   in the steam producing unit towards the textile to be treated. The directing arrangement
   may be connected to the steam producing unit. In this manner the steam may be
   distributed to the textile to be treated and utilized to improve removal of wrinkles from the
   textile to be treated.
10
    In use, steam thus, may be emitted, to, into, or onto, the textile to be treated. The
   stretching of the textile to be treated by means of the airflow from the first outlet in
   connection with subjecting the textile to be treated to steam brings about a drawing out
   of the wrinkles, which improves a wrinkle removing operation.
15
   According to embodiments, the directing arrangement may comprise a second outlet. In
   this manner steam produced in the steam producing unit may be emitted towards a
   textile to be treated from the second outlet.
20 According to embodiments, the directing arrangement may comprise an enclosure to be
   filled with steam from the steam producing unit, inside which enclosure the textile to be
   treated may be place during treatment.
   According to embodiments, the second outlet may be arranged in connection with the
25 textile contact surface. In this manner steam may be emitted from the first outlet into or
   onto the textile in, or, at the textile contact surface, i.e. in a part of the appliance, in
   which stretching of a textile to be treated by means of the airflow takes place.
   The second outlet may comprise a number of openings provided in the textile contact
30 surface or next to the textile contact surface. The second outlet may comprise one or
   more openings extending along the textile contact surface, in the textile contact surface,
   or next to the textile contact surface. The steam producing unit may be any suitable
   steam producing unit such as e.g., a boiler with an electrical heating element or a flash
   boiler. The steam producing unit may be a separate unit connected to the by means of a
                                                    3

   WO 2013/164275                                                               PCTIEP2013/058773
   conduit to the remainder of the appliance. Alternatively, the steam producing unit may be
   arranged in an entity together with the air flow generating device, and/or it may be
   arranged in close proximity of the second outlet.
 5 According to embodiments, the airflow direction may form an angle of 70 - 120 degrees
   to the normal of the textile contact surface. In this manner it may be ensured that the
   airflow engages with a textile to be treated.
   According to embodiments, the airflow direction may form an angle of 85 - 105 degrees
10 to the normal of the textile contact surface. In this manner it may be ensured that the
   airflow engages thoroughly with a textile to be treated and that the textile will abut
   against the textile contact surface.
   The term "airflow direction" refers to one direction. Suitably, the first outlet thus, may be
15 formed to provide a substantially parallel airflow from the first outlet. However, the first
   outlet may be formed to provide a small dispersion angle of an airflow from the first
   outlet. In the latter case, the above mentioned airflow direction refers to a centre line of
   the dispersion angle.
20 According to embodiments, the first outlet may comprise a first passage and a second
   passage. The textile contact surface may be arranged between the first passage and the
   second passage. In these embodiments the airflow is arranged to be directed in at least
   two different directions, suitably opposite directions, away from the textile contact
   surface. The airflow being directed in at least two different directions engages with a
25 textile to be treated and exerts a force to the textile, drawing the textile towards, and to
   abut against, the textile contact surface. Thus, the textile is subjected to stretching over
   the textile contact surface, where steam may be emitted towards the textile. A good
   removal of wrinkles may thus be achieved. A user simply has to move the textile contact
   surface together with the first outlet along the textile to portions thereof, where wrinkles
30 are to be removed. The user does not have to provide any stretching of the textile. In
   particular for lighter textiles used in garments such as shirts and blouses, the stretching
   of the textile by means of the appliance itself may prove useful.
                                                  4

   WO 2013/164275                                                              PCTIEP2013/058773
   According to embodiments, the first outlet may extend around the textile contact surface.
   In this manner a textile to be treated will be thoroughly engaged by the airflow and
   provide a sure abutment of the textile against the textile contact surface. Such a first
   outlet extending around the textile contact surface may comprise two or more passages,
 5 the passages being connected to the airflow generating device.
   According to embodiments, a directing surface may extend in a direction from the textile
   contact surface adjacent to the first outlet. In this manner the airflow may be directed
   along a textile to be treated downstream of the first outlet. The textile thus, may abut well
10 against the textile contact surface.
   According to embodiments, the textile contact surface, the first outlet, and the second
   outlet may be arranged in a manually maneuverable handle. In this manner a user may
   hold the handle and direct it along a textile to be treated.
15
   According to embodiments, a cross section of the first outlet may be adjustable in size.
   In this manner the airflow may be controlled and thus, an abutment force of a textile
   against the textile contact surface may be controlled.
20 According to embodiments, the first outlet may comprise at least one flexible edge
   portion. In this manner the flexible edge portion may automatically adjust a size of the
   first outlet and automatically adjust the airflow. The flexible edge portion may be biased
   toward a position in which the first outlet is closed, or substantially closed, or has a
   reduced cross section. The airflow will open and/or adjust the cross section of the first
25 outlet. Thus, an air velocity of the airflow may be maintained within a predetermined
   range substantially independently of the volume of air in the airflow.
   According to embodiments, the first outlet may be separate from the second outlet.
30 According to embodiments, a second conduit may extend from the steam producing unit
   to the second outlet and a first conduit may extend from the airflow generating device to
   the first outlet. In this manner steam may be directed from the steam producing unit
   through the second conduit to the second outlet and an airflow may be directed from the
   airflow generating device through the first conduitto the first outlet.

   A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved method for removal of
   wrinkles from a textile.
   According to an aspect of the invention, the object is achieved by a method of treating a
 5 textile, the method comprising:
   producing an airflow, and
   directing the airflow through a first outlet arranged adjacent to the textile contact surface
   in an airflow direction directed away from a normal of a textile contact surface, for
10 making the textile interact with the textile contact surface.

   An airflow generating device 18 is connected to a first outlet 20 via a first conduit 22.
   Accordingly, the first conduit 22 extends from the airflow generating device 18 to the first
   outlet 20. The first outlet 20 is arranged adjacent to the textile contact surface 10. The
   first outlet 20 is arranged to direct an airflow from the airflow generating device 18 in an
 5 airflow direction, indicated by arrows 24. The airflow direction 24 is directed away from a
   normal 26 of the textile contact surface 10. The second outlet 12 is separate from the
   first outlet 20.

   Fig. 2 illustrates a cross section of a portion of an appliance 2 according to
   embodiments. The appliance 2 is illustrated in use, as a textile 28 is being treated by
   means of the appliance 2. Steam produced in a steam producing unit is emitted form a
   second outlet 12 arranged in connection with a textile contact surface 10. An airflow
20 produced in an airflow generating device is directed through a first outlet 20 in an airflow
   direction 24 away from a normal 26 of the textile contact surface 10. The airflow is
   directed along the textile 28 to be treated. Thus, the airflow from the first outlet 20 draws
   air between the textile 28 and the textile contact surface 10 with it in the airflow direction
   24 and draws the textile 28 towards the textile contact surface 10. Put differently, the
25 airflow engages the textile 28 to abut against the textile contact surface 10.
   Simultaneously, the textile 28 is stretched by the airflow from the first outlet 20 being
   directed in different directions. The steam emitted from the second outlet 12 is emitted
   towards the textile 28 as it is being stretched by the airflow. Thus, wrinkles may be
   removed, at least to a large extent, from the textile 28,

   A directing surface 30 extends in a direction from the textile contact surface 10 adjacent
   to the first outlet 20. A length of the directing surface 30 extending from the first outlet 20
   may be 5 mm, but the length may be shorter or longer.

   Figs. 3a, 3b, and 3c illustrate different configurations of portions of appliances according
   to embodiments. A first outlet 20 is arranged adjacent to a textile contact surface 10.
   Openings 16 of a second outlet are arranged in the textile contact surface 10 and are
   arranged for emitting steam towards a textile to be treated. In use of the appliance, an
 5 airflow is directed from the first outlet 20 in an airflow direction 24 away from a normal of
   the textile contact surface 10.
   In the Fig. 3a embodiments the first outlet 20 extends around the textile contact surface
   10. The first outlet 20 may be divided into two or more passages. The textile contact
10 surface 10 is substantially circular by may alternatively have a different shape, such as
   oval, elongated, square, or triangular.
   In the Fig. 3b embodiments the first outlet 20 comprises a first passage 21 and a second
   passage 23. The textile contact surface 10 is arranged between the first passage 21 and
15 the second passage 23. The airflow direction 24 is directed in two opposite directions
   away from the textile contact surface 10.
   In the Fig. 3c embodiments the first outlet 20 is arranged adjacent one side only of the
   textile contact surface 10. In these embodiments, a textile to be treated is engaged by
20 the airflow and stretched by the airflow while the portion of the appliance comprising the
   textile contact surface 10 and the first outlet 20 is either held still, or moved in a direction
   substantially opposite to the airflow direction 24.
   Fig. 4 illustrates a cross section of a portion of an appliance 2 according to
25 embodiments. These embodiments resemble the Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 embodiments. The
   main differences will now be discussed.
   The first outlet 20 is arranged to direct an airflow in an airflow direction 24 away from a
   normal 26 of the textile contact surface 10. The airflow direction 24 forms an angle a of
30 somewhere between 70 and 85 degrees to the normal 26 of the textile contact surface
   10.
   A funnel forming portion 32 comprising the second outlet 12 is movably arranged in the
   first conduit 22, as indicated by arrows 34. Thus, a cross section of the first outlet 20 is

   adjustable in size. The funnel forming portion 32 may be movable to such an extent that
   the first outlet 20 may be closed. A user of the appliance may move the funnel forming
   portion 32, e.g. by means of a non-shown handle. Conversely, a portion of the first
   conduit 22 surrounding the funnel forming portion 32 at the first outlet 20 may be
 5 movably arranged in relation to the funnel forming portion 32 to adjust a size of the first
   outlet 20.
   Fig. 5 illustrates a partial cross section of a portion of an appliance 2 according to
   embodiments. These embodiments resemble the Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 embodiments. The
10 main differences will now be discussed.
   The first outlet 20 is arranged to direct an airflow in an airflow direction 24 away from a
   normal 26 of the textile contact surface 10. The airflow direction 24 forms an angle a of
   somewhere between 105 and 120 degrees to the normal 26 of the textile contact surface
15 10.
   The textile contact surface 10, the second outlet 12, and the first outlet 20 are arranged
   in a handle 36. The handle 36 is manually manoeuvrable such that a user may hold the
   handle 36 and direct it along a textile to be treated. The first and first conduits 14, 22
20 extend through a flexible hose 38. The hose 38 leads to a unit of the appliance 2
   comprising the steam producing unit and the airflow generating device.
   In Figs. 4 and 5, airflow directions 24 at an outer end of a suitable interval of airflow
   directions 24 have been illustrated. Accordingly, the airflow direction 24 may be directed
25 at any angle a between 70 and 120 degrees to a normal 26 of the textile contact surface
   10, or at any angle a between 85 and 105 degrees to a normal 26 of the textile contact
   surface 10.
   Fig. 6 illustrates a cross section of an outer portion of a first and a first outlet 12, 20 of an
30 appliance according to embodiments. These embodiments resemble the above
   discussed embodiments. The main difference lies in that the first outlet 20 comprises at
   least one flexible edge portion 40, 42. A size of the first outlet 20 may thus be
   automatically adjusted. A first flexible edge portion 40 is arranged as an extension of the
   textile contact surface 10. A second flexible edge portion 42 is arranged at the directing

   and second flexible edge portions 40, 42 may be manufactured from any suitable flexible
 5 material such as rubber or a thermoplastic elastomer. Alternatively, the first outlet 20
   may be provided with only one of the first or the second flexible edge portions 40, 42.
   Fig. 7 illustrates schematically an appliance 2 according to embodiments.
   The appliance 2 may be used for treating a textile, such as a garment, in particular to
10 remove wrinkles from the textile. The appliance 2 comprises a directing arrangement
   comprising an enclosure 44 inside which a textile 28 to be treated may be placed.
   The appliance 2 comprises a steam producing unit 4 for producing steam from water.

   are arranged in a stationary unit to be installed e.g. in a laundry room.
   Although the invention has been described with reference to example embodiments,
 5 many different alterations, modifications and the like will become apparent for those
   skilled in the art. The appliance may be used for treating a relevant textile after the textile
   has been treated with steam in a preceding steam treatment step. Additives such as
   detergent or perfume may be used in the water from which steam is produced in the
   steam producing unit. Airflow and steam may for instance be mixed. This may be
10 arranged in different ways. An amount of steam is led from the steam producing unit 4
   into the airflow, e.g. in the first conduit 22 or at the first outlet 20. Conversely, part of the
   airflow from the airflow generating device 18 may be led into the steam, e.g. in the
   second conduit 14 or at the second outlet 12. It also may be forint to lead both air and
   steam into the steam and the airflow. In embodiments where air and steam are mixed
15 the invention still is based on the use a first outlet for an airflow which engages with the
   textile. The appliance may be used for treating a relevant textile after the textile has
   been treated with steam.
   The textile contact surface 10 may have a curved shape. A length of the directing
20 surface 30 may be variable. The textile contact surface 10 may be smooth or rough
   (without sharp edges or protrusions).
   Therefore, it is to be understood that the foregoing is illustrative of various example
   embodiments and that the invention is defined only the appended claims.
