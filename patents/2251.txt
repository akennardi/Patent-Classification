   Field of the Invention
   The present invention generally relates to gaming apparatus and methods of
   gaming. A particular embodiment of the present invention relates to gaming
15 apparatus and methods of gaming that offer a progressive prize.
   Background of the Invention
   With the increase of gambling at gaming venues has come increased competition
   between gaming venues to obtain a larger share of the total gambling spend.
20 Gaming venue operators have therefore continuously looked for new variations and
   types of games in order to attract both new and return customers to their venues.
   In response to this need, suppliers of gaming devices and systems have attempted
   to provide the sought after variety, while still developing games that comply with
25 the relevant regulations in the jurisdiction of the gaming venue operator. Suppliers
   of gaming devices therefore are faced with restrictions on the types of games and
   gaming apparatus that are allowable, both in terms of the prevailing regulations
   and in terms of providing a return on investment to the gaming venue operators.
30 In addition, it is important that a player be able to understand the operation of a
   game quickly so that the player can start to quickly play the game and therefore
   extract maximum entertainment from the game.
   Progressive jackpots may be offered on gaming machines. A progressive controller
                                                                  10380444_1(GHMattes) P78980.AU.720/06/2018

                                               2
    may be programmed to accumulate a percentage of the turnover bet on the
    machine, that percentage being accumulated in a progressive pool. On the
    occurrence of a predetermined event, the amount of money in the pool may be
    awarded to a player.
  5
     Recently progressive jackpot gaming systems have been implemented which
    operate across a group of linked gaming machines, accumulating a percentage of
    turnover bet on all of the linked machines into one or more progressive pools.
    Again the contents of a particular progressive pool may be awarded to a player
io  when certain trigger conditions are met.
    While the modified player progressive systems have increased player interest, the
    lack of actual or perceived player involvement in the increment of either standalone
    or linked progressive systems can mean that players may easily tire of playing
15  these systems.
    Any reference in this specification to the prior art does not constitute an admission
    that such prior art was well known or forms part of the common general knowledge
    in any jurisdiction.

   Detailed description
25 In Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings, one example of a gaming machine
   suitable for implementing the present invention is generally referenced by arrow
   10.
   The gaming machine 10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which is
30 displayed representations of a game 16, that can be played by a player. A mid-trim
   20 of the gaming machine 10 houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   play the game 16. The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input mechanism 24
   including a coin input chute 24A and a bill collector 24B. A top box 26 may carry
   artwork 28, including for example, pay tables and details of bonus awards and
35 other information or images relating to the game. Further artwork and/or
                                                                  10380444_1(GHMattes) P78980.AU.720/06/2018

                                             8
   information may be provided on the front panel 29 of the console 12. A coin tray 30
   is mounted beneath the console 12 for cash payouts from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 1 is in the form of a video display unit, particularly a
 5 cathode ray tube screen device. Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid crystal
   display, plasma screen, any other suitable video display unit, or the visible portion
   of an electromechanical device. The top box 26 in a more preferred form of gaming
   machine 10 to implement the present invention includes a display, for example a
   video display unit, which may be of the same type as the display 14, or a different
io type of display.
    Figure 2 shows a block diagram of a gaming apparatus, generally referenced by
   arrow 100, suitable for implementing the present invention. The gaming apparatus
    100 may, for example, operate as a standalone gaming machine of the type shown
15 in Figure 1. However, the gaming apparatus 100 may alternatively operate as a
   networked gaming machine, communicating with other network devices, such as
   one or more servers or other gaming machines. The gaming apparatus 100 may
   also have distributed hardware and software components that communicate with
   each other directly or through a network. Accordingly, different reference numerals
20 have been used in Figure 2 from Figure 1 for components that may be equivalent.
   The gaming apparatus 100 includes a game controller 101, which in the illustrated
   example includes a computational device 102, which may be a microprocessor,
   microcontroller, programmable logic device or other suitable device. Instructions
25 and data to control operation of the computational device 102 are stored in a
   memory 103, which is in data communication with, or forms a part of, the
   computational device 102. Typically, the gaming apparatus 100 will include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory, with
   such memories being collectively represented by the memory 103. The instructions
30 to cause the game controller 101 to implement the present invention will be stored
   in the memory 103.
   The gaming apparatus may include hardware meters 104 for the purposes of
   regulatory compliance and also include an input/output (1/O) interface 105 for
                                                                 10380444_1(GHMattes) P78980.AU.720/06/2018

                                               9
    communicating with the peripheral devices of the gaming apparatus 100. The
    input/output interface 105 and/or the peripheral devices may be intelligent devices
    with their own memory for instructions and data.
  5 In the example shown in Figure 2, the peripheral devices that communicate with
    the controller are one or more displays 106, user input devices 107, a card and/or
    ticket reader 108, a printer 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110
    and a coin output mechanism 111. One or more of the displays 106 may include a
    touch screen 106A, forming part of the user input devices 107. Additional devices
io  may be included as part of the gaming machine 100, or devices omitted as
    required for the specific implementation.
    In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a communications interface, for
    example a network card 112. The network card, may for example, send status
15  information, accounting information or other information to a central controller,
    server or database and receive data or commands from a the central controller,
    server or database. One or more of the peripheral devices, for example the
    card/ticket reader 108 may be able to communicate directly with the network card
    112.
20
    The game controller 101 may also include a random number generator 113, which
    generates a series of random numbers that determine the outcome of a series of
    random game events played as part of a game on the gaming apparatus 100. As
    explained in more detail in relation to Figure 4, the computational device 102 may
25  include two or more controllers or processors, which may be local or remote from
    each other and the displays 106.
    Figure 3 shows an exemplary block diagram of the main components of the
    memory 103. The RAM 103A typically temporarily holds program files for execution
30  by the computational controller 102 and related data. The EPROM 103B may hold
    be a boot ROM device and/or may contain some system or game related code.
    The mass storage device 103C is typically used to store game programs, the
    integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by the computational
    controller 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B or elsewhere.
                                                                 10380444_1(GHMattes) P78980.AU.720/06/2018

                                             10
    Figure 4 shows a gaming system 200. The gaming system 200 includes a network
    201, which for example may be an Ethernet network. Gaming devices 202, shown
    arranged in three banks 203 of two gaming devices 202 in Figure 4, are connected
  5 to the network 201. The gaming devices 202 may be gaming machines 10, as
    shown in Figure 1 or form part or all of another gaming apparatus 100. Single
    gaming devices 202 and banks 203 containing three or more gaming devices 202
    may also be connected to the network 201.
io  One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the network 201. The displays
    204 may, for example, be associated with a bank 203 of gaming devices. The
    displays 204 may be used to display representations associated with game play on
    the gaming devices 202, and/or used to display other representations, for example
    promotional or informational material.
15
    Servers may also be connected to the network 201. For example, a game server
    205 may generate game outcomes for games played on the gaming devices 202, a
    database management server 206 may manage the storage of game programs
    and associated data for downloading or access by the gaming devices 202 in a
20  database 206A, and a jackpot server 207 may control one or more jackpots
    associated with the gaming devices 202.
    Further servers may be provided to assist in the administration of the gaming
    system 200, including for example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
25  licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses to particular games. An
    administrator terminal 210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the network
    201 and the devices connected to the network.
    The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming systems, other local
30  networks, for example a corporate network and/or a wide area network such as the
    Internet through a firewall 211.
    Figure 15 shows a process flow diagram 500 of a process performed in
    accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The process may be
                                                                 10380444_1(GHMattes) P78980.AU.720/06/2018

                                              11
    performed by the network gaming system 200, in which the gaming devices 202
    may each comprise part or all of a gaming apparatus 100 and the following
    description assumes this implementation. However, those skilled in the relevant
    arts will appreciate that the process will also be able to be implemented by other
  5 gaming systems. The process shown in Figure 15 is described below with
    reference to a set of exemplary screen shots of a game.
    Referring now to Figure 5, a screen shot 300 may be displayed on a LCD screen or
    CRT display occupying the top box 26 and/or may appear on the display 204,
io  which may be located near to gaming devices 202 that can play a game associated
    with the screen shot 300. In the screen shot 300, a plurality of prize pool amounts
    are shown 301a to 305a, together with a representation of a corresponding
    character or 'bandit' 301b to 305b. A larger illustration of one of the bandits 301 b
    305b, in this example the bandit 306, may also be shown, the bandit
15
    306 alternating between different characters as time progresses as an attract
    screen display.
    Display of the screen shot 300 may be under the control of the jackpot server 207,
20  which may communicate directly or indirectly with the display in the top box 26 and
    display 204. Alternatively, the display in the top box 26 may be controlled by the
    game controller 101.
    A plurality of gaming devices 202 each provide a game, which may be the same
25  game or different games. In a preferred embodiment of the invention as presently
    contemplated, the game includes a chance to win one of the prize pool amounts
    301a to 305a in a feature game. Each prize pool amount 301a to 305a may have
    its own associated feature game.
30  The feature game associated may be triggered during play of the game in a
    number of different ways. An exemplary diagrammatic representation of a game
    screen 310 is shown in Figure 6, the game being a spinning reel game with five
    spinning reels, each of which display three symbols to form outcomes of the game.
    The outcomes of the exemplary game are the symbols in the paylines I to 3 shown
                                                                   10380444_1(GHMattes) P78980.AU.720/06/2018

                                               12
    in Figure 6.
    After a bet has been placed at step 501, the spinning reel game may be played
    (step 502). The spinning reel game            may result in the occurrence of a
  5 predetermined symbol based trigger event occurring (determined in step 504) in
    the game. In Figure 6, the occurrence of five PEDRO symbols in payline 2 may be
    a trigger event for the feature game and provided the player has purchased play of
    payline 2, then the feature will be commenced by the jackpot server 207 taking
    control of a display 106 of the gaming device 202 to display the feature (step 506).
io  In this embodiment, the reels of the spinning reel game include trigger symbols that
    are associated with the various prize pool amounts 301a to 305a, with particular
    trigger symbols resulting in play for a particular prize pool.
    Alternatively, the feature may be triggered according an event that occurs
15  independently of any particular outcome of the game, for example based on
    turnover of the game as described in Australian patent number 754689, the
    contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In this case there
    may be only a single prize pool, or alternatively, where multiple prize pools are
    provided the prize pool that is played for may be selected randomly.
20
    After the base game has been completed and a feature game triggered, the jackpot
    server 207 may cause the feature screen display 312 of Figure 7 to be displayed
    on the display 106, in which the bandit 306 is shown enlarged and an indicator is
    displayed to highlight the jackpot amount associated with the bandit (eg the arrow
25  313). A corresponding screen display may be displayed on the display 204. This
    display may replace the game display on the gaming device 202, or alternatively be
    presented on a separate display, for example in a display provided in the top box
    26.
30  After a short period of time, the display of Figure 7 is replaced with the screen
    display 316 of Figure 8, shown as one example game feature. The screen display
    is split into two sections; section 317 showing the bandit character (PEDRO)
    attempting to access a safe and section 318 showing a series of buildings with
    windows 319, one window 319 being arbitrarily selected by the computer prior to
                                                                   10380444_1(GHMattes) P78980.AU.720/06/2018

                                             13
   the commencement of the feature game as a window behind which PEDRO is
   hiding. Alternatively, whether PEDRO is hiding behind a window 319 may be
   determined when that window is selected, with a 1 in 15 chance for the first
   window, a 1 in 14 chance for the second window and so on.
 5
   The feature game has two outcomes, a winning outcome in which the player of the
   gaming device 202 is awarded the prize pool 301a and a losing outcome, in which
   the player is not awarded the prize pool 301a and the prize pool is incremented.
   The increment amount may be viewed as an amount that the bandit PEDRO is
io playing for and the prize pool 301a may be viewed as an amount that the player is
   playing for in a competition. A consolation prize may be awarded to the player of
   the gaming device 202 if the losing outcome occurs. Although the examples
   described herein are for feature games with only two outcomes, the feature game
   may also have other winning or losing outcomes associated with other game
15 events, such as the award of a fixed value prize or the award of a number of free
   games.
   The amount that the bandit is playing for is displayed as shown at 320 and the
   award amount 301a is displayed at 321 (step 508). The amount displayed at 320
20 may be randomly selected from a set of predetermined potential increment
   amounts or from a range of potential increment amounts. Therefore, the increment
   amount may vary between occurrences of the feature game. The amount could
   alternatively be set for every occurrence of the feature game.
25 The amount that the player is playing for may be determined by the amount of
   credits bet per line in the game play that triggered the feature game, multiplied by
   the award amount 301a. In the example shown, the amount shown at 321 is the
   award amount 301a, as one credit only was bet per line. If two credits per line had
   been bet in the underlying base game, then the amount shown at 321 in Figure 8
30 would be 259,130 credits.
   In the game screen displays of Figure 8, the PEDRO bandit is shown to be
   attempting to open a safe, which will open when the slots 322 on the safe door 323
   have letters spelling out OPEN. The player is represented as attempting to find
                                                                  10380444_1(GHMattes) P78980.AU.720/06/2018

                                               14
    PEDRO behind one of the fifteen windows 319.
    Accordingly, at the start of the feature, the player selects one of the windows 319,
    and if this window is not the arbitrarily predetermined location of the bandit the
  5 words "No bandit" are shown. After each selection (or beforehand if the order of
    play is reversed), a reel associated with one of the slots 322 is spun and its
    stopping position randomly determined. The reels associated with the slots 322
    may be as shown in Figure 9, as having half their positions blank and half their
    positions displaying one of the letters from the word "Open". Accordingly, for each
io  spin, there is a 50% chance of a letter being displayed. If a letter is displayed, then
    a reel associated with another of the slots 322 is spun and so on until either the
    word "Open" is spelled out, in which case the outcome of the feature is a losing
    outcome, or a blank space is displayed, in which case the player is prompted to
    select another window.
15
    The result after two trials of this game is displayed in Figure 10. Two letters have
    been revealed in slots 322 by the bandit, and two windows 319 have been selected
    by the player, neither of which resulted in a winning outcome.
20  This process will continue (step 510) until the player selects the window which the
    bandit has been assigned as being behind, in this case the award amount 301a is
    won by the player (step 512) and the screen shot 326 shown in Figure 11 is
    displayed. Following this, the award amount 301a is reset to its seed amount (step
    514), 100,000 in this example, and the screen shot 328 shown in Figure 12 is
25  displayed, which is the same as the screen shot 300 of Figure 5, except that the
    award amount 301a has been updated. Once the award amount 301a has been
    reset, control of the display 106 of the gaming device 202 may be returned to the
    jackpot server 207 or progressive controller (step 518).
30   If instead the bandit character spells OPEN across the slots 322 the amount
    displayed at 320 is added to the award amount 301a. This results in the screen
    shots 330 and 332 shown in Figures 13 and 14 respectively, indicating to the
    player that they have not won the award amount 301a and showing that the award
    amount 301a has been increased by the amount shown at 320 (step 516). Once
                                                                   10380444_1(GHMattes) P78980.AU.720/06/2018

                                              15
   the award amount 301a has been increased, control of the display 106 of the
   gaming device 202 may be returned to the jackpot server 207 or progressive
   controller 101 (step 518).
 5 Each award amount 301a -          305a may be associated with a separate second
   screen feature game that preferably shows a competition between the player, who
   is attempting to win one of the award amounts 301a -       305a, and a bandit, who is
   attempting to win an amount to be added to the jackpot. Alternatively, the feature
   game may not be a second screen bonus and may be played using the same
10 screen format as the game. For example, in the spinning reel game, two separate
   symbols may be collected each time they are displayed in a series of games, one
   for the bandit and one for the player, with the first player to collect a number of
   symbols winning. The series of games may be provided as a feature game, for
   example a series of free games, or the competition may occur during ordinary play
15 of the game. Alternatively, an animation may occur in the game simply displaying
   the word "WIN" or "LOSE" to indicate the outcome of the feature game.
   In addition to the jackpot prizes that give award amounts 301a - 305a, the gaming
   system may maintain another jackpot prize, which may be a standard progressive
20 based on turnover on a gaming machine or a fixed value prize, In one embodiment,
   the progressive is designed to have a high value or a high value fixed prize is
   provided, which is won only if the player "beats" all of the bandits (five the example
   shown) in their respective feature games.
25 A number of gaming devices 202 may contribute to the same award amounts 301 a
   - 305a and play common feature games to win the award amounts 301a -                          305a.
   Alternatively, the award amounts 301a -         305a may be provided for a single
   gaming device 202.
