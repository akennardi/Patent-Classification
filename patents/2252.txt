with reduced use of starting materials.

                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0014] In a first aspect, the invention provides methods of making a compound of Formula I:
                                                     CI   0         SO 2Me
                                                                OH
                                             0
                                                  Formula I
or a salt thereof. According to the invention, such methods comprise the steps of performing
hydrolysis of a precursor ester with a base under biphasic conditions where the precursor ester
group is a carbon-containing moiety or a silyl-containing moiety; and b) isolating the compound
of Formula I or a salt thereof. In various embodiments, the biphasic conditions include aqueous
acetone, such as 30% aqueous acetone. In various embodiments, the biphasic conditions change
over time such that a reaction mixture that is biphasic at initiation of reaction becomes less
biphasic or monophasic as the reaction proceeds.
[0015] In various embodiments, the base for hydrolysis is sodium hydroxide, for example, in
amounts ranging from about 1.0 to about 1.5 equivalents, preferably about 1.2 equivalents.
[0016] In various embodiments, the precursor ester includes an ester R group which is a
substituted or unsubstituted group selected from lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl,
cyclo(lower)alkyl,   cyclo(lower)alkenyl,    aryl, aralkyl, heterocyclyl, and heteroaryl groups.
Preferably, the ester R group is a benzyl group.
[0017] In various embodiments, the invention provides methods of making a compound of
Formula I requiring the use of a phase transfer catalyst for performing base-catalyzed hydrolysis.
In various embodiments, the phase transfer catalyst is a quaternary ammonium salt such as
                                                        2

tetrabutylammonium hydroxide. Such phase transfer catalysts may be present in an amount
ranging from about 0.01 equivalents to about 0.5 equivalents.
[0018] In a second aspect, the invention provides compositions which are reaction mixtures
corresponding to the methods of making the compound of Formula I as described above.
[0019] In a third aspect, the invention provides methods of purifying a compound of Formula I
by recrystallization.  In various embodiments, the recrystallization is performed with aqueous
acetone. Accordingly, methods are provided comprising a) obtaining crude compound of
Formula I or a salt thereof and recrystallizing the crude compound with aqueous acetone; and b)
isolating the compound of Formula I or a salt thereof by removal of aqueous acetone. Preferably,
the aqueous acetone is about 30% aqueous acetone. In various embodiments, the aqueous
acetone is used in an amount of about 7 volumes. Preferably, the method is performed for a
period of time ranging from about 1 hour to about 48 hours.
[0020] In a fourth aspect, the invention provides compositions which are recrystallization
mixtures corresponding to the methods of purifying a compound of Formula I as described
above.
[0021] In a fifth aspect, the invention provides a compound of Formula I synthesized according
to the methods described herein, or recrystallized according to the methods described herein, or
both. Preferably, the compound is essentially free of methyl ethyl ketone.           In various
embodiments, the compound of Formula I has an enantiomeric excess of greater than about 96%
upon isolation from the reaction mixture for base-catalyzed           hydrolysis  and prior to
recrystallization. In various embodiments, the compound of Formula I synthesized and/or
recrystallized according to the methods of the invention has an enantiomeric excess of greater
than about 98%.
[0022] In a sixth aspect, the invention provides a compound of Formula I wherein the compound
is polymorph Form II as described herein. In various embodiments, the compound polymorph
Form II is present in a solid composition with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In various
embodiments, the composition is at least about 50% by weight Form II, or alternatively, less than
about 5% by weight Form II. In various embodiments, the solid composition further comprises
one or more solid forms selected from the group consisting of amorphous, Form I, Form III,
Form IV, Form V, and Form VI.

                             INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
[0023] All publications, patents, and patent applications mentioned in this specification are
herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent, or
patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.
                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0024] While selected embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described
herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way
of example only.     Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to those
skilled in the art without departing from the invention. It should be understood that various
alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing
the invention. It is intended that the appended claims define the scope of the invention and that
methods and structures within the scope of these claims and their equivalents be covered thereby.
[0025] Definitions
[0026] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same
meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this invention belongs.
[0027] As used in the specification and claims, the singular form "a", "an" and "the" includes
plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
[0028] As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those salts which are
suitable for pharmaceutical use, preferably for use in the tissues of humans and lower animals
without undue irritation, allergic response and the like.      Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of
amines, carboxylic acids, and other types of compounds, are well known in the art. For example,
S. M. Berge, et al., describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J Pharmaceutical
Sciences, 66: 1-19 (1977), incorporated herein by reference. The salts can be prepared in situ
during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention, or separately by
reacting a free base or free acid function with a suitable reagent, as described generally below.
For example, a free base function can be reacted with a suitable acid. Furthermore, where the
compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts
thereof may, include metal salts such as alkali metal salts, e. g. sodium or potassium salts; and
alkaline earth metal salts, e. g. calcium or magnesium salts.       Examples of pharmaceutically
acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids
                                                      4

such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid
or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid,
succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange.
Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzoate,
bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate,
digluconate, dodecylsulfate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate,
hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate,           lactobionate,
lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate,
oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate,
propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p- toluenesulfonate, undecanoate,
valerate salts, and the like. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium,
lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts
include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations
formed by direct reaction with the drug carboxylic acid or by using counterions such as halide,
hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, sulfonate and aryl sulfonate.
[0029] "Pharmaceutically acceptable        carrier" or "pharmaceutically acceptable      excipient"
includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents,
isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for
pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional
media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions
of the invention is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into
the compositions.
[0030] "Prodrug" is meant to indicate a compound that may be converted under physiological
conditions or by solvolysis to a biologically active compound described herein. Thus, the term
"prodrug" refers to a precursor of a biologically active compound that is pharmaceutically
acceptable. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject, i.e. an ester, but is
converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis to the free carboxylic acid.
The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed
release in a mammalian organism (see, e.g., Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs (1985), pp. 7-9,
21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam).       A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al.,
"Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems," A.C.S. Symposium Series, Vol. 14, and in Bioreversible
                                                      5

Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and
Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated in full by reference herein. The term
"prodrug" is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active
compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of an
active compound, as described herein, may be prepared by modifying functional groups present
in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine
manipulation or in vivo, to the parent active compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein a
hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active
compound is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or
free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate,
formate and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol or acetamide, formamide and benzamide
derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like.
[0031] "Subject" refers to an animal, such as a mammal, for example a human. The methods
described herein can be useful in both human therapeutics and veterinary applications. In some
embodiments, the patient is a mammal, and in some embodiments, the patient is human. In
various embodiments, the patient is a non-human animal, such as a dog, cat, rabbit, mouse, rat,
cow, horse, pig, or chicken.
[0032] Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds
which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example,
compounds having structures wherein a hydrogen is replaced by by a deuterium or tritium, or a
                       13
carbon is replaced by    C- or 14C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention.
[0033] The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of
atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds.           For example, the
compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H),
iodine-125 (mI) or carbon-14 (14C).      All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present
invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
[0034] When ranges are used herein for physical properties, such as molecular weight, or
chemical properties, such as chemical formulae, all combinations and subcombinations of ranges
and specific embodiments therein are intended to be included. The term "about" when referring
to a number or a numerical range means that the number or numerical range referred to is an
approximation within experimental variability (or within statistical experimental error), and thus
                                                     6

the number or numerical range may vary from, for example, between 1% and 15% of the stated
number or numerical range. The term "comprising" (and related terms such as "comprise" or
"comprises" or "having" or "including") includes those embodiments, for example, an
embodiment of any composition of matter, composition, method, or process, or the like, that
"consist of' or "consist essentially of' the described features.
[0035] Abbreviations used herein have their conventional meaning within the chemical and
biological arts.
[0036] Compound of Formula I
[0037] The compound of Formula I:
                                                 CI  0           SO2Me
                                                             OH
                                                     I  H
                                         0
                                              Formula I
has been found to be an effective inhibitor of LFA- 1 interactions with ICAM-1.      It is a member
of a class of directly competitive inhibitors of LFA-1, binding to ICAM's binding site on LFA-1
directly, and thus excludes ICAM binding.       Directly competitive inhibitors of LFA- 1 may offer
the potential for more effective modulation of the inflammatory and/or immunologic response
than allosteric inhibitors provide because these inhibitors occlude the binding site more
effectively.     Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of Formula I are also included. Additional
information regarding the compound of Formula I can be found in US Patent 8,080,562; US
Patent Publication 2009/0298869; US Patent Publication 2011/0092707; US Patent 8,084,047;
US 2010/0092542;       and US Patent Publication 2006/0281739; the entire contents of each of
which are incorporated by reference.
[0038] In order to develop clinically useful therapeutics, drug candidates need to be chemically
pure enough to administer to a subject and of an acceptable physical form in order to be
formulated in pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms.          One advantageous route to obtain
higher purity, reproducibility of physical form, and stability is to identify one or more useful
crystalline forms. The capacity to exist in different crystalline forms is known as polymorphism
and is known to occur in many organic molecules. These different crystalline forms are known
                                                       7

as "polymorphic modifications" or "polymorphs."           While polymorphic modifications have the
same chemical composition, they differ in packing, geometric arrangement, and other descriptive
properties of the crystalline solid state. As such, these modifications may have different solid
state physical properties to affect, for example, the solubility, dissolution rate, bioavailability,
chemical and physical stability, flowability, fractability, and compressibility of the compound as
well as the safety and efficacy of drug products based on the compound.            In the process of
preparing a polymorph, further purification, in terms of gross physical purity or optical purity,
may be accomplished as well.
[0039] A number of different forms, including crystalline forms, of the compound of Formula I
have been discovered, including the crystalline forms A-E and the amorphous form. While
crystallization is often performed on organic compounds, it is not predictable in advance as to
which conditions will provide suitable conditions to lead to formation of a particular crystalline
form.     Further, it is not predictable as to which particular crystalline form will provide the
necessary mixture of physical properties, nonlimiting examples of which are described above, to
yield a desirable drug dosage form, once formulated.           Additional information regarding the
crystalline forms A-E and the amorphous form of the compound of Formula I can be found in
US     Patent   8,080,562;    US    Patent Publication     2009/0298869;   US   Patent   Publication
2011/0092707;      US    Patent 8,084,047;    US    2010/0092542;      and US    Patent Publication
2006/0281739; the entire contents of each of which are incorporated by reference.
[0040] Methods of Manufacture of the Compound of Formula I
[0041] In one embodiment, the compound of Formula I is synthesized as in the following
Schemes 1-7. The final product of this synthesis yields the compound of Formula I as an
amorphous solid or as a crystalline form such as Forms A-E, or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt, either directly or indirectly. Variants of this overall route may provide superior yields, cost
of goods, and/or superior chiral purity.
[0042] Protecting groups for amino and carboxy groups are known in the art. For example, see
Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley Interscience, 1981, and subsequent
editions.
[0043] In various embodiments in the subsequent schemes, HATU is used as a reagent in amide
bond forming reactions. Alternatively, HATU is not used. In various embodiments, at least one
                                                        8

amide-bond forming reaction is performed with thionyl chloride as a reagent in place of HATU.
In various embodiments, all amide-bond forming reactions are performed with thionyl chloride
as a reagent to form acid chlorides.

[0045] A first alternative protecting strategy produces compound 5', a protected species as
shown in Scheme 1. The synthesis begins by reductively aminating 3, 5, dichlorobenzaldehyde,
compound 1'. Cyclization of compound 2' provides compound 3'. Protection of the free amine
of compound 3' as a protected species provides compound 4'. A carboxylic acid functionality is
introduced by treatment of compound 4' with introduction of carbon dioxide, to produce
compound 5'. In various embodiments, the protecting group of compound 4' is a benzofuranyl
carbonyl moiety derived from compound 18'.
[0046] In various embodiments, upon scaleup to multikilogram and larger scale reactions,
treatment of compound 4' with strong base (such as n-butyllithium (nBuLi) to generate a lithio
species, or lithium diisopropyl amide (LDA) to generate the lithio species) is performed in flow
mode rather than batchwise reaction due to instability of lithio species except at cold
temperatures. Flow rates and residence times may be adjusted to maximize yield.

used as a starting material for Compound 5'. The starting material is chlorinated (x2) for
example, with N-chlorosuccinimide. In various embodiments, the chlorination is performed in
the presence of a sulfonic acid. In various embodiments, the sulfonic acid is selected from p
toluenesulfonic acid and methanesulfonic acid. Following protection of the amino group, the
hydroxy group is functionalized, for example, as the triflate ester, which is carbonylated to yield
the amino-protected methyl ester. Hydrolysis of the methyl ester yields the amino protected
carboxylic acid.

[0069] In one approach, an ester protecting group is removed with acid catalyzed hydrolysis. For
example, a methyl ester protecting group is removed with acid catalyzed hydrolysis.
Alternatively, a benzyl ester protecting group is removed with acid, for example HCl in dioxane.
The solvent for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis may be any industrially available solvent such as an
aprotic solvent, a protic solvent, a polar solvent, a non-polar solvent, an ionic solvent, or a
pressurized gas such as supercritical carbon dioxide. In various embodiments, the solvent is an
aprotic solvent such as dioxane or tetrahydrofuran or acetone. Variously, the solvent may be
selected from hexane, benzene, toluene, 1,4-dioxane, chloroform, diethyl ether, dichloromethane,
tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, acetone, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, n
butanol, isopropanol,    n-propanol,    ethanol,  methanol,    water, formic    acid, acetic acid,

sulfonic acids. In various embodiments, the acid is trifluoroacetic acid. In one embodiment, the
ester may be removed by nucleophilic displacement, such as using sodium iodide in
dimethylsulfoxide.
[0070] In one approach, a benzyl ester protecting group is removed with palladium on carbon.
For example, the benzyl ester of compound 19' is removed by transfer hydrogenolysis using
10% palladium on carbon, using formic acid and triethylamine in a 5:1 mixture of
methanol:THF, to produce the compound of Formula I.
[0071] In various embodiments, the compound 19' is a compound of Formula AA. A general
strategy to convert a compound of Formula AA is provided by base hydrolysis of the ester to
yield the compound of Formula I.

The compound of Formula AA may be reacted with a base in a solvent to accomplish the base
catalyzed saponification of Formula AA to yield the compound of Formula I.
[0072] The saponification solvent may be any industrially available solvent such as an aprotic
solvent, a protic solvent, a polar solvent, a non-polar solvent, an ionic solvent, or a pressurized
gas such as supercritical carbon dioxide.      In various embodiments, the solvent is an aprotic
solvent such as dioxane or tetrahydrofuran or acetone. Variously, the solvent may be selected
from hexane, benzene, toluene, 1,4-dioxane, chloroform, diethyl ether, dichloromethane,
tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, acetone, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, n
butanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, ethanol, methanol, water, and combinations thereof. In a

saponification reactions. In various embodiments, the base is a hydroxide such as potassium
hydroxide or sodium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide.
[0073] In various embodiments, the R group is any carbon containing moiety. Such compounds
may be useful as synthetic intermediates of compounds of Formula I, or as prodrugs of Formula
I.Within the group where R is any carbon containing moiety, R may be selected from lower
alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, cyclo(lower)alkyl,       cyclo(lower)alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl,
heterocyclyl, and heteroaryl, any of which can be substituted or unsubstituted. In various
embodiments, the lower alkyl group is methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, pentyl, isobutyl, t
butyl, or hexyl. In various embodiments, the R group of Formula AA is a benzyl group.             In
various embodiments of Formula AA, the carbon-containing moiety R does not include a benzyl
group.
[0074] In various embodiments the R group is a silyl-containing moiety such that Formula AA is
a silyl ester.
[0075] In one embodiment, an ester protecting group is removed with base catalyzed hydrolysis
in a homogeneous reaction such as a reaction in solution. For example, a benzyl ester protecting
group is removed with NaOH in aqueous dioxane. In one embodiment, a benzyl ester protecting
group is removed with NaOH in aqueous acetone. In various embodiments of a homogeneous
liquid reaction, NaOH may range from about 0.1N to about 2N, such as about 0.5 N, 0.6 N, 0.7
N, 0.8 N, 0.9 N, 1.0 N, 1.1 N, 1.2 N, 1.3 N, 1.4 N, or 1.5 N, with all listed concentrations
understood to be "about".

[0076] In one embodiment, an ester protecting group is removed from Compound 19' or
Formula AA with base catalyzed hydrolysis in a heterogeneous reaction in the presence of phase
transfer catalyst. For example, Compound 19' or a compound of Formula AA is contacted with
phase transfer catalyst in aqueous acetone. In various embodiments, the reaction occurs in the
presence of a solid-liquid interface. In various embodiments, the reaction occurs in a slurry of
solvent and crystalline material. In various embodiments, the reaction is biphasic. In various
embodiments, the reaction begins as a biphasic batch reaction and becomes increasingly
homogeneous as the reaction proceeds and starting material is converted to product which
remains in solution. In various embodiments, racemization of starting material is minimized by
reducing exposure of unreacted starting material to base through the use of biphasic conditions.
[0077] In various embodiments, the progress of the reaction is monitored by assessing the level
of solid material remaining. In various embodiments, the reaction is deemed to be essentially
complete when the reaction mixture is essentially monophasic (i.e. all solids have been dissolved
into solution).
[0078] In various embodiments, base hydrolysis is performed with an amount of base ranging
from about 0.9 equivalents to about 3 equivalents, such as about 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5,
1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, or 3.0 equivalents, all amounts
being about. In various embodiments, the amount of base ranges from about 1.0 to about 1.5
equivalents, such as about 1.2 equivalents. In various embodiments, the base is NaOH. In various
embodiments, base hydrolysis is performed with NaOH as base in the presence of less than a
stoichiometric amount of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide.

greater than 0 hours and less than about 24 hours, less than about 12 hours, less than about 8
hours, less than about 6 hours, or less than about 4 hours.
[0080] In various embodiments, base catalyzed hydrolysis of compound 19' or the compound of
Formula AA is performed in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst. In various embodiments,
the phase transfer catalyst is a quaternary ammonium salt, a phosphonium salt, or a crown ether.
In various embodiments, the phase transfer catalyst is selected from benzyltrimethylammonium
chloride,     hexadecyltributylphosphonium          bromide,      tetrabutylammonium       hydroxide,
tetrabutylammonium bromide, methyltrioctylammonium chloride, and tetrabutylammonium
chloride. In various embodiments, the phase transfer catalyst is tetrabutylammonium hydroxide.
                                                       19

In one embodiment, the amount of phase transfer catalyst is less than a stoichiometric amount.
For example, the amount of phase transfer catalyst is about 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06,
0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, or 0.9 equivalents, all amounts being about.
[0081] In further embodiments, the ester protecting group can be removed by other procedures
known in the literature including slightly acidic and slightly basic conditions. The ester
protecting groups can also be removed by treatment with ester hydrolyzing enzymes like pig
liver esterase, cholesterol esterase, amino esterase, etc. The removal of the ester protecting group
from Formula AA can further be achieved by application of strong acid resins, weak acid resins,
strong base resins, or weak base resins.
[0082]    Upon formation of the compound of Formula I as a crude compound, a variety of
isolation and/or purification methods are available. The compound of Formula I may be isolated
as a crude product through distillation or evaporation of solvent from the final deprotection step.
Removal of solvent may be through removal to dryness, or through removal of a portion of
solvent to yield a solid/liquid mixture which is filtered and/or washed. Crude compound may be
purified by slurrying in a solvent such as methyl ethylketone (MEK), acetonitrile, methylene
chloride, or acetone, which solvents may be aqueous or nonaqueous. The compound for Formula
I may be isolated/purified through recrystallization and/or washing with additional solvents.
Procedures for recrystallization in small and large scales are known in the art.
[0083] A partial list of useful solvents for the preparation and purification of the compound of
Formula I includes, for example, water, aliphatic solvents such as pentane, petroleum ether, and
hexane; aromatic solvents such as toluene and xylene, aliphatic ketones and esters such as
methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, and butyl acetate, alcohols, such as
ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol, and methyl alcohol, acetonitrile, ethers, such as ethyl ether, tert
butyl methyl ether (TBME), and tetrahydrofuran, alkenes and alkynes, alkenyl esters                 and
alcohols, alkynyl esters and alcohols, and aromatic esters and alcohols. In one embodiment,
recrystallization is performed in pharmaceutically acceptable solvent(s). In one embodiment, a
useful solvent is aqueous acetone.
[0084] In various embodiments, recrystallization is performed with from about 0.5 volumes to
about 15 volumes of recrystallization solvent, for example from about 5 volumes to about 15
volumes, or for example about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 volumes. In various embodiments,
recrystallization is performed with at least about 10 volumes of recrystallization solvent. In
                                                         20

various embodiments, recrystallization provides one or more crops of crystals, for example 1
crop, 2 crops, 3 crops, or more. In various embodiments, recrystallization provides a yield of at
least 50%, or at least 60%, or at least 70%, or at least 80%, or at least 90% in a first filtration
and/or in a combination of filtrations.
[0085] In various embodiments, final deprotection and/or recrystallization is performed in
aqueous acetone. Water and acetone are miscible thus allowing for a range from 100%/0%
water/acetone to 0%/100% water acetone.        In various embodiments, the ratio of water/acetone is
about 10/90, 20/80, 30/70, 40/60, 50/50, 60/40, 70/30, 80/20, or 90/10, all amounts being
"about". Preferably, the solvent for final deprotection and/or recrystallization is about 30%
aqueous acetone. In various embodiments, recrystallization with aqueous aceone provides a yield
of at least 50%, or at least 60%, or at least    7 0%,  or at least 80%, or at least 90% in the first
filtration and/or in a combination of filtrations. In various embodiments, aqueous acetone is used
from about 0.5 volumes to about 15 volumes, such as about 7 volumes, as provided above.
[0086] In various embodiments, a pH modifier is used during isolation and/or purification of the
compound of Formula I. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the solubility
of the compound of Formula I is modified by exposing a salt of the compound of Formula I to
acidic conditions such that the carboxylic acid moiety of the compound of Formula I is
protonated, thus making the compound of Formula I more soluble in organic solvents. In various
embodiments, a pH modifier is added to a composition of crude compound of Formula I to
produce a pH less than about 7. In various embodiments, the pH is lowered to less than about 5,
less than about 4, or less than about 3. In various embodiments, the pH is within a range of about
1 to about 5. In various embodiments, the pH is about 2. The pH modifier may be an acid, such
as an organic or mineral acid. In various embodiments, the pH modifier is hydrochloric acid. In
various embodiments, the pH modifier is dilute HCl solution, such as 4 N HCl, 1 N HCl solution,
0.1 N HCl, or 0.01 N HCl solution. In various embodiments, local pH of less than about 1 is
avoided so as to reduce racemization and/or hydrolysis.
[0087] In various embodiments, recrystallization is performed at a temperature above room
temperature. In various embodiments, recrystallization is performed at a temperature between
about 50C and about 90C. In various embodiments, compound of Formula I is dissolved in
recrystallization solvent at a temperature         above room temperature,       filtered to remove
                                                       21

particulates, cooled to room temperature or less than room temperature such that crystallization
occurs, and filtered to separate crystals and mother liquor.
[0088] In various embodiments, recrystallization is performed in a batch process with a time to
completion of greater than 0 hours and less than about 3 days, less than about 2 days, less than
about 36 hours, less than about 24 hours, less than about 12 hours, less than about 8 hours, less
than about 6 hours, or less than about 4 hours.
[0089] In various embodiments, recrystallization is performed in a batch process on a scale
larger than about 10 kilograms, 100 kilograms, one metric ton, or 10 metric tons, all amounts
being about. In various embodiments, final deprotection and/or recrystallization is performed
with a yield of at least 60%, or at least 70%, or at least 80%, or at least 90% in the first filtration
and/or in a combination of filtrations.
[0090] In further embodiments, the compound Formula I can be purified by other procedures
known in the literature including but not limited to crashing out of a solution, freeze-drying or
lyophilization, dialysis, or the like.

[0098] Pharmaceutical Compositions and Formulations and Kits
[0099] In various embodiments, the amorphous form or any of the crystalline Forms A, B, C, D,
or E, or a combination thereof of the compound of Formula I are administered in pharmaceutical
compositions. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise pharmaceutically
acceptable carriers and excipients as well as the amorphous form or any of the crystalline Forms
A, B, C, D, or E, or a combination thereof of the compound of Formula I, in order to formulate
the composition for appropriate administration to the subject.
[00100]          In some of the embodiments of the invention, the crystalline form remains in
crystalline form in the pharmaceutical composition. In other embodiments, the amorphous form
and/or crystalline form is solubilized and is no longer crystalline. In the latter case, however, the
superior purity or other physicochemical properties of the amorphous form and/or crystalline
form contributes to, i.e., for example, ease of handling the form of the compound of Formula I to
form the composition, superior storage capabilities of crystalline form prior to formulation, better
therapeutic index, tolerability of the compound of Formula I to the subject, or decreased side
effects of the compound of Formula I. The amorphous form or crystalline Forms A, B, C, D, or
E may be milled to provide desirable properties for formulation.

[00114]          To a glass reactor was charged 3,5-dichlorobenzaldehyde. Absolute ethanol was
added to the batch slowly (this addition is mildly exothermic) and agitation started.                2,2
Diethoxyethylamine (1.03 equiv) was slowly added to the batch, keeping the batch temperature
at 20-78 0C. The batch was then heated to 76-78 0 C for 2 h. GC-MS analysis indicated reaction
completion (starting material < 1%). The batch was cooled to ambient temperature for work-up.
The batch was concentrated in vacuo to a residue and azeotroped with heptanes (x2). The
residue was cooled and held at 0-5 0C for 12 h to form a suspension. The solids were collected
by filtration and the cake was washed with cold (0-5 0 C) heptanes, and dried under hot nitrogen
(45-50 0C) to afford Compound 2' as a white solid (94% yield).
[00115]          To a glass reactor was charged concentrated 95-98% sulfuric acid (25.9 equiv).
The batch was heated to 120-125 0C and a solution of Compound 2' in CH 2 Cl 2 was added slowly
over 1 h, keeping the batch temperature between 120-125 0C. The batch was then stirred at 120
125 0C for 6 h. The batch was cooled to < 50 0 C. To a glass reactor was charged DI water and
the batch temperature was adjusted to 0-5           0C.      The reaction mixture was slowly transferred,
keeping the batch temperature between 0-50 0C. DI water was used to aid the transfer. To the
batch was added Dicalite 4200. The batch was filtered through a pad of Dicalite 4200. To the
filtrate was added 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution slowly over 3 h, keeping the batch
                                                             28

temperature between 0-50 'C to adjust the pH tol2. The resulting suspension was stirred at 45
50 0C for 2 h and the solids were collected by filtration. The filter cake was slurried in DI water
at 30-35 0C for 1 h. The batch was filtered. The cake was washed with heptanes and dried in
vacuum oven at 45-50 0C for 22 h to give crude compound 2" as a tan solid (75% yield), which
was further purified by recrystallization.
[00116]         To a reactor was added platinum dioxide (0.012 equiv), Compound 2", and
MeOH (10 vol) and the suspension was stirred at room temperature under argon for 10 minutes.
The reaction mixture was inerted with argon three times and then stirred under 125 psi of
hydrogen at room temperature for 25 hours. HPLC analysis indicated complete reaction with
less than 1% of the starting material remaining. After standing, the supernatant was decanted
from the solids (catalyst) by vacuum. To the solids was added methanol and the slurry was
mixed under nitrogen. The solids were allowed to settle on the bottom over several hours. The
supernatant was decanted from the solids by vacuum. The combined supernatants were filtered
through Celite under a blanket of nitrogen and the filter pad was washed with MeOH (x2). The
combined filtrate and washes were concentrated to dryness. The residue was slurried in MTBE.
The mixture was treated with 3 M HCl while maintaining the temperature <40 'C resulting in the
formation of a heavy precipitate. The mixture was stirred at 35-40 'C for 60 to 90 minutes. The
batch was cooled to 0-5 'C, stirred for 60 to 90 minutes and then filtered. The filter cake was
washed with cold DI water (x2) followed by a displacement wash with MTBE (x2). The filter
cake was dried under reduced pressure to afford Compound 3 Hydrochloride Salt (86% yield).
The hydrogenation catalyst can be recovered and re-used.
[00117]         Compound 3 and trityl chloride were added to the reaction flask. DCM (10 vol)
was added to the reactor and agitation was started to form slurry.       The reaction mixture was
cooled to 10-15 'C. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (2.5 equiv) was slowly added to the reaction
mixture, maintaining the temperature at 15-25 'C during the addition.          Once addition was
complete, the batch was stirred at 15 to 25 'C for a minimum of 60 minutes. The reaction was
assayed by HPLC by diluting a sample with acetonitrile and then injecting it on the HPLC. The
first assay after 30 minutes indicated that the reaction was complete with <1% of starting
material observed by HPLC analysis. The reaction mixture was diluted with DI water (5 vol).
The reaction mixture was stirred for 5 minutes after which it was transferred into a separation
funnel and the phases were allowed to separate. The DCM layer was washed with DI water (5
                                                     29

washed with brine (5 vol) by stirring for 5 minutes and then allowing the phases to separate. The
DCM layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and the filter cake was washed with DCM
(x2). The combined filtrate and washes were concentrated to a residue that was azeotroped with
EtOAc (x2). The residue was suspended in EtOAc and stirred for 1 hour in a 40 'C water bath.
The resulting slurry was cooled to 0-5 'C for 1 hour and then filtered. The filter cake was
washed twice with EtOAc and then dried under reduced pressure to afford Compound 4.

was accomplished, using sodium bicarbonate (3 equivalents), t-butyl dicarbonate (Boc 2 0, 1.1
equivalent) in dioxane and water, to obtain compound 7 in 98% yield.                                    A methyl sulfone
functionality was introduced by treating the bromo compound 7 with copper iodide (0.4

of methanesulfinic acid (3.9 equivalents) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 95-100C for a total
of 9 hours, with two further additions of copper iodide (0.2 equivalents) and L-proline (0.4
equivalents) during that period. Compound 8 was isolated in 96% yield. The carboxylic acid of
compound 8 was converted to the benzyl ester, compound 9, in 99% yield, using benzyl alcohol
(1.1     equivalent),   dimethylaminopyridine                  (DMAP,        0.1       equivalent)          and    N-(3

copper iodide (28.7g), potassium carbonate (40 g) and L-proline (26.75g) were added at 28-30
'C. Reaction was heated to about 87 'C for about 17-19 hours. Reaction was cooled and
quenched with crushed ice, stirred for 30-40 minutes, and the pH was adjusted from about 12 to
about 3-4 with citric acid (350 g). Quenched reaction mixture was filtered, extracted with
dichloromethane x3, washed with ammonium chloride solution, washed with sodium bisulphite
solution, and washed with brine. Crude product in dichloromethane was concentrated in vacuo
until moisture content was below about 0.5%, and used in next step without further isolation.
Crude compound 8 in dichloromethane was charged with benzyl alcohol and DMPA with
stirring under nitrogen. Reaction cooled to 0-5 'C. EDC-HCL (1.03 equiv) added with stirring
for 30 minutes. Upon completion of reaction by TLC and HPLC, the reaction was quenched with
sodium bicarbonate solution, the organic layer was separated, and the aqueous layer was
extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was washed with citric acid solution, and
combined organic layers were washed with brine solution. Dichloromethane was removed at 45
50 'C, and the concentrate was used for next step without further isolation. The amino group of
compound 9 was deprotected by adding a 4N solution of HCl in dioxane to compound 9 at 10
15'C in methylene chloride. The HCl salt of the free amino species, compound 10 was isolated

phenyl-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) (1.0 equivalent) in methylene chloride for 72 hours.
Compound 16 in a mixture of DMF, methanol, and triethylamine, was added to a prepared
solution of palladium acetate, 1,3-Bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp), DMF and methanol in

20C. The reaction was monitored by HPLC. The reaction was quenched with methanol, solvent
was removed with vacuum, and the crude residue of Compound 16 was used without further
purification. Compound 16 as crude residue was dissolved in 4 volumes of dimethylformamide
and 2 volumes methanol. To the solution was added 0.02 eq. of palladium acetate, 0.02 eq. of
dppp, and CO under pressure. The reaction was monitored by HPLC. Following workup,
Compound 17 was isolated as a crude oily residue without further purification. The residue of
compound 17 was dissolved in methanol (5 volumes) and 1 volume of sodium hydroxide

keeping the reaction temperature below -60 'C. After stirring for one hour at -60 0C, the reaction
was allowed to warm to 15 'C and furan-2-carbaldehyde (1.3 equivalents) dissolved in THF was
added. After stirring for 20 hrs at room temperature, the reaction was rotary evaporated to
dryness to yield ethyl 2-((1,3-dioxolan2-yl)methyl-3-(furan-2-yl)acrylate,       which was used
directly in the next reaction.

phosphoric acid (85%) was added and the mixture was heated to 50 'C for an additional two hrs.
After removal of ethanol by rotary evaporation, the material was extacted with toluene, washed

Sodium hydroxide (4 M, 3 equivalents) was added and the reaction was stirred overnight. After
concentration via rotary evaporation, the aqueous solution was extracted with methyl tert-butyl
ether (MTBE), acidified to pH 2 with the addition of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and cooled
resulting in fine crystals of benzofuran-6-carboxylic acid, i.e., compound 18'. Compound 18'

[00170]         Approximately 320 mg of Form I was dissolved in acetone (15 mL). The solution

the observations from hot stage microscopy analysis of the polymorph.
[00172]         A thermogravimetric analysis graph of crystalline Form II is shown in Figure 8.
A mass loss of 1.5 wt%, attributed to liberation of water during the melt, followed by onset of
decomposition at 260 0 C is observed. Gravimetric moisture sorption analysis reveals that Form II
is moderately hygroscopic, absorbing 3.0 wt% water at 60% relative humidity and 3.4 wt% water
at 90% relative humidity.The water content of the Form II under 40% relative humidity is 2.8
wt%, which is close to the theoretical water content of a mono-hydrate of the compound (2.9
wt%). The water content of Form II by Karl Fisher titration is 3.2 wt%, again in-line with a
monohydrate of compound.
