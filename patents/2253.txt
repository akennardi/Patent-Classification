                                        TECHNICAL FIELD
            The present invention provides tricyclic fused thiophene derivatives, as well as their
   compositions and methods of use, that modulate the activity of Janus kinase (JAK) and are
   useful in the treatment of diseases related to the activity of JAK including, for example,
15 inflammatory disorders, autoimmune disorders, cancer, and other diseases.
                                           BACKGROUND
            Protein kinases (PKs) regulate diverse biological processes including cell growth,
   survival, differentiation, organ formation, morphogenesis, neovascularization, tissue repair,
   and regeneration, among others. Protein kinases also play specialized roles in a host of
20 human diseases including cancer. Cytokines, low-molecular weight polypeptides or
   glycoproteins, regulate many pathways involved in the host inflammatory response to sepsis.
   Cytokines influence cell differentiation, proliferation and activation, and can modulate both
   pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses to allow the host to react appropriately to
   pathogens. Signaling of a wide range of cytokines involves the Janus kinase family (JAKs) of
25 protein tyrosine kinases and Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs).
   There are four known mammalian JAKs: JAKI (Janus kinase-1), JAK2, JAK3 (also known as
   Janus kinase, leukocyte; JAKL; and L-JAK), and TYK2 (protein-tyrosine kinase 2).
            Cytokine-stimulated immune and inflammatory responses contribute to pathogenesis
   of diseases: pathologies such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) arise from
30 suppression of the immune system, while a hyperactive or inappropriate
   immune/inflammatory response contributes to the pathology of autoimmune diseases (e.g.,
   asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroiditis, myocarditis), and illnesses such as
   scleroderma and osteoarthritis (Ortmann, R. A., T. Cheng, el al. (2000) Arthritis Res 2(1):
   16-32).
                                                    2

            Deficiencies in expression of JAKs are associated with many disease states. For
   example, Jak1-/- mice are runted at birth, fail to nurse, and die perinatally (Rodig, S. J., M. A.
   Meraz, et al. (1998) Cell 93(3): 373-83). Jak2-/- mouse embryos are anemic and die around
   day 12.5 postcoitum due to the absence of definitive erythropoiesis.
 5          The JAK/STAT pathway, and in particular all four JAKs, are believed to play a role
   in the pathogenesis of asthmatic response, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis,
   and other related inflammatory diseases of the lower respiratory tract. Multiple cytokines that
   signal through JAKs have been linked to inflammatory diseases/conditions of the upper
   respiratory tract, such as those affecting the nose and sinuses (e.g., rhinitis and sinusitis)
10 whether classically allergic reactions or not. The JAK/STAT pathway has also been
   implicated in inflammatory diseases/conditions of the eye and chronic allergic responses.
            Activation of JAK/STAT in cancers may occur by cytokine stimulation (e.g. IL-6 or
   GM-CSF) or by a reduction in the endogenous suppressors of JAK signaling such as SOCS
   (suppressor or cytokine signaling) or PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) (Boudny, V.,
15 and Kovarik, J., Neoplasm. 49:349-355, 2002). Activation of STAT signaling, as well as
   other pathways downstream of JAKs (e.g., Akt), has been correlated with poor prognosis in
   many cancer types (Bowman, T., et al. Oncogene 19:2474-2488, 2000). Elevated levels of
   circulating cytokines that signal through JAK/STAT play a causal role in cachexia and/or
   chronic fatigue. As such, JAK inhibition may be beneficial to cancer patients for reasons that
20 extend beyond potential anti-tumor activity.
            JAK2 tyrosine kinase can be beneficial for patients with myeloproliferative disorders,
   e.g., polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), myeloid metaplasia with
   myelofibrosis (MMM) (Levin, et al., Cancer Cell, vol. 7, 2005: 387-397). Inhibition of the
   JAK2V617F kinase decreases proliferation of hematopoietic cells, suggesting JAK2 as a
25 potential target for pharmacologic inhibition in patients with PV, ET, and MMM.
            Inhibition of the JAKs may benefit patients suffering from skin immune disorders
   such as psoriasis, and skin sensitization. The maintenance of psoriasis is believed to depend
   on a number of inflammatory cytokines in addition to various chemokines and growth factors
   (JCI, 113:1664-1675), many of which signal through JAKs (Adv Pharmacol.2000;47:113
30 74).
            Thus, new or improved agents which inhibit kinases such as JAKs are continually
   needed for developing new and more effective pharmaceuticals that are aimed at
   augmentation or suppression of the immune and inflammatory pathways (such as
   immunosuppressive agents for organ transplants), as well as agents for the prevention and
35 treatment of autoimmune diseases, diseases involving a hyperactive inflammatory response
                                                    3

   (e.g., eczema), allergies, cancer (e.g., prostate, leukemia, multiple myeloma), and some
   immune reactions (e.g., skin rash or contact dermatitis or diarrhea) caused by other
   therapeutics. The compounds of the invention, as well as its compositions and methods
   described herein are directed toward these needs and other ends.

            It is further appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity,
15 described in the context of separate embodiments, can also be provided in combination in a
   single embodiment (while the embodiments are intended to be combined as if written in
   multiply dependent form). Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for
   brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment, can also be provided separately or in
   any suitable subcombination.
20          At various places in the present specification, substituents of compounds of the
   invention are disclosed in groups or in ranges. It is specifically intended that the invention
   include each and every individual subcombination of the members of such groups and ranges.
   For example, the term "C 1 .6 alkyl" is specifically intended to individually disclose methyl,
   ethyl, C3 alkyl, C 4 alkyl, C5 alkyl, and C6 alkyl.
25          At various places in the present specification, linking substituents are described.
   Where the structure clearly requires a linking group, the Markush variables listed for that
                                                      38

   group are understood to be linking groups. For example, if the structure requires a linking
   group and the Markush group definition for that variable lists "alkyl" or "aryl" then it is to be
   understood that the "alkyl" or "aryl" represents a linking alkylene group or arylene group,
   respectively.
 5           At various places in the present specification, rings are described (e.g., "a piperidine
   ring"). Unless otherwise specified, these rings can be attached to the rest of the molecule at
   any ring member as permitted by valency. For example, the term "a 2H-tetrahydropyran
   ring" may refer to a 2H-tetrahydropyran -2-yl, 2H-tetrahydropyran -3-yl, 2H-tetrahydropyran
   4-yl ring, etc.
10           The term "n-membered" where n is an integer typically describes the number of ring
   forming atoms in a moiety where the number of ring-forming atoms is n. For example, 2H
   tetrahydropyran is an example of a 6-membered heterocycloalkyl ring, 1H-1,2,4-triazole is an
   example of a 5-membered heteroaryl ring, pyridine is an example of a 6-membered heteroaryl
   ring, and 1,2.3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalene is an example of a 10-membered cycloalkyl group.
15
             For compounds of the invention in which a variable appears more than once, each
   variable can be a different moiety independently selected from the group defining the
   variable. For example, where a structure is described having two R groups that are
   simultaneously present on the same compound, the two R groups can represent different
20 moieties independently selected from the group defined for R. In another example, when an
   optionally multiple substituent is designated in the form:
                                                         (R)p
   then it is to be understood that substituent R can occur p number of times on the ring, and R
   can be a different moiety at each occurrence. It is to be understood that each R group may
25 replace any hydrogen atom attached to a ring atom, including one or both of the (CH 2 )n
   hydrogen atoms. Further, in the above example, should the variable Q be defined to include
   hydrogens, such as when Q is said to be CH 2, NH, etc., any floating substituent such as R in
   the above example, can replace a hydrogen of the Q variable as well as a hydrogen in any
   other non-variable component of the ring.
30           As used herein, the phrase "optionally substituted" means unsubstituted or
   substituted. As used herein, the term "substituted" means that a hydrogen atom is removed
   and replaced by a substituent. It is to be understood that substitution at a given atom is
   limited by valency.

            The compounds described herein can be asymmetric (e.g., having one or more
30 stereocenters). All stereoisomers, such as enantiomers and diastereomers, are intended unless
   otherwise indicated. Compounds of the present invention that contain asymmetrically
   substituted carbon atoms can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Methods on
   how to prepare optically active forms from optically inactive starting materials are known in
   the art, such as by resolution of racemic mixtures or by stereoselective synthesis. Many
35 geometric isomers of olefins, C=N double bonds, and the like can also be present in the
                                                   44

   compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present
   invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are
   described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms.
            Resolution of racemic mixtures of compounds can be carried out by any of numerous
 5 methods known in the art. An example method includes fractional recrystallizaion using a
   chiral resolving acid which is an optically active, salt-forming organic acid. Suitable resolving
   agents for fractional recrystallization methods are, for example, optically active acids, such as
   the D and L forms of tartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid,
   malic acid, lactic acid or the various optically active camphorsulfonic acids such as
10 camphorsulfonic acid. Other resolving agents suitable for fractional crystallization methods
   include stereoisomerically pure forms of a-methylbenzylamine (e.g., S and R forms, or
   diastereomerically pure forms), 2-phenylglycinol, norephedrine, ephedrine, N
   methylephedrine, cyclohexylethylamine, 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, and the like.
            Resolution of racemic mixtures can also be carried out by elution on a column packed
15 with an optically active resolving agent (e.g., dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine). Suitable elution
   solvent composition can be determined by one skilled in the art.
            Compounds of the invention also include tautomeric forms. Tautomeric forms result
   from the swapping of a single bond with an adjacent double bond together with the
   concomitant migration of a proton. Tautomeric forms include prototropic tautomers which are
20 isomeric protonation states having the same empirical formula and total charge. Example
   prototropic tautomers include ketone - enol pairs, amide - imidic acid pairs, lactam - lactim
   pairs, enamine - imine pairs, and annular forms where a proton can occupy two or more
   positions of a heterocyclic system, for example, 1H- and 3H-imidazole, 1H-, 2H- and 4H
   1,2,4-triazole, IH- and 2H- isoindole, and IH- and 2H-pyrazole. Tautomeric forms can be in
25 equilibrium or sterically locked into one form by appropriate substitution.
            Compounds of the invention can also include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the
   intermediates or final compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic
   number but different mass numbers. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and
   deuterium. In some embodiments, 1, 2, or 3 CH 2 groups in the azetidine ring of Formula I are
30 replaced by a CHD or CD 2 group. In some embodiments, 1, 2, or 3 CH 2 or CH groups in the
   piperidine ring of Formula I are replaced by a CHD, CD 2 or CD group, respectively. In some
   embodiments, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 CH 2 or CH groups in the piperidine ring of Formula I are
   replaced by a CHD, CD 2 or CD group, respectively.
            The term, "compound," as used herein is meant to include all stereoisomers,
35 geometric iosomers, tautomers, and isotopes of the structures depicted.

             All compounds, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can be found together
   with other substances such as water and solvents (e.g., hydrates and solvates) or can be
   isolated.
             In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention, or salts thereof, are
 5 substantially isolated. By "substantially isolated" is meant that the compound is at least
   partially or substantially separated from the environment in which it was formed or detected.
   Partial separation can include, for example, a composition enriched in the compounds of the
   invention. Substantial separation can include compositions containing at least about 50%, at
   least about 60%, at least about 70%. at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about
10 95%, at least about 97%, or at least about 99% by weight of the compounds of the invention,
   or salt thereof. Methods for isolating compounds and their salts are routine in the art.
             The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to those
   compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of
   sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and
15 animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or
   complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
             The expressions, "ambient temperature" and "room temperature," as used herein, are
   understood in the art, and refer generally to a temperature, e.g. a reaction temperature, that is
   about the temperature of the room in which the reaction is carried out, for example, a
20 temperature from about 20 "C to about 30 'C.
             The present invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the
   compounds described herein. As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to
   derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by
   converting an existing acid or base moiety to its salt form. Examples of pharmaceutically
25 acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues
   such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like.
   The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention include the non-toxic salts of
   the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. The
   pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent
30 compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods.
   Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these
   compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an
   organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl
   acetate, alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol, or butanol) or acetonitrile (ACN) are
35 preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington's PharmaceuticalSciences, 17th ed.,

 5 Synthesis
             Compounds of the invention, including salts thereof, can be prepared using known
   organic synthesis techniques and can be synthesized according to any of numerous possible
   synthetic routes, such as those in the Schemes below. The reactions for preparing compounds
   of the invention can be carried out in suitable solvents which can be readily selected by one of
10 skill in the art of organic synthesis. Suitable solvents can be substantially non-reactive with
   the starting materials (reactants), the intermediates, or products at the temperatures at which
   the reactions are carried out, e.g., temperatures which can range from the solvent's freezing
   temperature to the solvent's boiling temperature. A given reaction can be carried out in one
   solvent or a mixture of more than one solvent. Depending on the particular reaction step,
15 suitable solvents for a particular reaction step can be selected by the skilled artisan.
             Preparation of compounds of the invention can involve the protection and
   deprotection of various chemical groups. The need for protection and deprotection, and the
   selection of appropriate protecting groups, can be readily determined by one skilled in the art.
   The chemistry of protecting groups can be found, for example, in Wuts and Greene,
20 Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th ed., John Wiley & Sons: New Jersey, (2007),
   which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
             Reactions can be monitored according to any suitable method known in the art. For
   example, product formation can be monitored by spectroscopic means, such as nuclear
   magnetic resonance spectroscopy (e.g., 'H or "C), infrared spectroscopy, spectrophotometry
25 (e.g., UV-visible), mass spectrometry, or by chromatographic methods such as high
   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or thin layer chromatography (TLC).
             Compounds of Formula I can be synthesized by procedures analogous to those in the
   schemes below. When XI-X 2 -X3 is -N=CR 2-NR3 -, X 4 is C, and X 5 is C, compounds of
   Formula I can be prepared as illustrated in Scheme 1. Appropriately substituted
30 thienopyridines 1 can be subjected to nitration under conditions such as tetrabutylammonium
   nitrate and trifluoroacetic anhydride in dichloromethane or nitric acid in sulfuric acid to give
   compounds of formula 2. Reaction of thienopyridinols 2 in heated POCI or other suitable
   chlorination conditions such as POCl3/PCl5 provides the corresponding chlorides 3. Coupling
   of compounds 3 with an appropriate R 3-NH2 in the presence of a suitable base such as
35 diisopropylethylamine affords compounds 4. Reduction of nitro compounds 4 using catalytic
                                                    47

   hydrogenation conditions with catalyst such as palladium or nickel or using iron or other
   suitable reducing conditions yields the corresponding diamines 5. Condensation of
   compounds 5 with an appropriate aide (activated with triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate)
   generates the desired compounds 6. The diamine can also react with an appropriate acid
 5 R2 CO 2 H under coupling conditions to give an amide intermediate which subsequently can be
   transformed compounds 6 via an intermolecular condensation. The R 2 and R3 can be further
   modified to desired groups. Alternatively, the R 3 can be further transformed to groups
   disclosed in the invention via modification on compounds 4 and 5.

20 react with N-iodosuccinimide to give compounds 7. Reaction of thienopyridinols 7 in heated
   POCl 3 or other suitable chlorination conditions such as POCl3 /PCl 5 provides the
   corresponding chlorides 8. Reaction of the iodo compounds 8 with an appropriate alkyne
   compound catalyzed by a suitable palladium and copper catalyst such as

            When X1 -X2 -X3 is =N-CR2 =CR3 -, X 4 is N, and X 5 is C, compounds of Formula I can
 5 be prepared as illustrated in Scheme 4. Reaction of thienopyrazines 17 with hydrogen
   peroxide in acetic acid gives an N-oxide intermediate which upon treatment with phosphorous
   oxychloride provides compounds 18. Substitution of chloride with Boc-NH 2 under Buchwald
   conditions yields compounds 19. Alkylation of carbamates 19 with appropriately substituted
   2-halomethyl ketone [halo-CH 2C(O)R3 ] by methods known to one skilled in the art gives
10 compounds 20. The later can be further converted to corresponding substituted compounds 21
   under standard alkylation or aldo-condensation conditions if necessary. The deprotection of
   21 to 22 can be accomplished using conditions such as trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane
   or HC in dioxane. Cyclization of 22 to compounds 23 can be accomplished by methods
   known to one skilled in the art, for example treatment with trifluoroacetic anhydride and
15 trifluoroacetic acid mixture. Further functionalization of R2, R3, R4, R- can be performed, if

   exchange of 29 with butyl lithium then quenched with a suitable alkylation reagent (for

   of 30 with a lithium reagent such as butyl lithium followed by aqueous work up affords
   monobromo-pyrazoles 31. Suzuki reaction of 31 with borates 27 (prepared from bromide 26
   by reacting with pinacol borate in the presence of a suitable palladium catalyst) can give

   ammnonium hydroxide. Condensation of 35 with ortho esters then generates tricyclic
   compounds 36. The later can be subjected to coupling conditions such as Suzuki coupling
   conditions to provide compounds of formula 37. Further modifications of substitutions, if
15 desired, may be performed by methods known by one skilled in the art.

            When X I-X 2-X 3 is =CR'-N=CR3 -, X 4 is N, and X' is C, compounds of Formula I can
   be prepared as illustrated in Scheme 9. Thienopyrazines 18 can be converted to cyano
   compounds 42 via Pd-mediated cyanation, such as zinc cynide in the presence of
 5 palladium(II) trifluoroacetate and racenic-2-(di-tert-butylphosphino)- 1,1' -binapthyl.
   Subsequent reduction of nitriles 42 gives amines 43 using well known conditions such as
   palladium catalyzed hydrogenation in the presence of HCl. The coupling of amines 43 with
   acids R 3CO 2H can be achieved under standard amide coupling conditions such as
   HATU/diisopropylethylamine. Cyclization of aides 44 to the tricylic compounds of formula
10 45 can be accomplished by conversion to the corresponding thioamide (by reacting with
   Lawesson's reagent, for example) followed by treatment with an activating agent (such as a
   mercury salt, a silver salt or a copper salt).

10 methyl magnesium bromide affords ketones 58, which can then be reduced to give

   pyridine thioethers 61 with sulfuryl chloride followed by treatment with ammonia provides
   cyclized products 62. Alternatively, compounds 62 can be synthesized by reacting compounds
   60 with hydroxylamine and sulfur. Nitration of compounds 63 gives compounds of formula
   64. Coupling of compounds 64 with an appropriate R 3-NH 2 in the presence of a suitable base
10 such as diisopropylethylamine affords compounds 65. Reduction of nitro compounds 65 using
   catalytic hydrogenation conditions with catalyst such as palladium or nickel or using iron or
   other suitable reducing conditions yields the corresponding diamines 66. Condensation of
   compounds 66 with an appropriate amide (activated with triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate)
   generates the desired compounds 67. The diamine can also react with an appropriate acid
15 R 2 CO 2 H under coupling conditions to give an amide intermediate which subsequently can be
   transformed compounds 67 via an intermolecular condensation. The R 2 and R 3 can be further

   Methods
              Compounds of the invention are JAK inhibitors, and the majority of the compounds
   of the invention, are JAKI selective inhibitors. A JAKI selective inhibitor is a compound
 5 that inhibits JAKI activity preferentially over other Janus kinases. For example, the
   compounds of the invention preferentially inhibit JAKI over one or more of JAK2, JAK3,
   and TYK2. In some embodiments, the compounds inhibit JAKI preferentially over JAK2
   (e.g., have a JAK1/JAK2 IC5 o ratio >1). In some embodiments, the compounds are about 10
   fold more selective for JAKI over JAK2. In some embodiments, the compounds are about 3
10 fold, about 5-fold, about 10-fold, about 15-fold, or about 20-fold more selective for JAKI
   over JAK2 as calculated by measuring IC 5 o at I mM ATP (e.g., see Example A).
              JAKI plays a central role in a number of cytokine and growth factor signaling
   pathways that, when dysregulated, can result in or contribute to disease states. For example,
   IL-6 levels are elevated in rheumatoid arthritis, a disease in which it has been suggested to
15 have detrimental effects (Fonesca, J.E. et al., Autoimmunity Reviews, 8:538-42, 2009).
   Because IL-6 signals, at least in part, through JAKI, antagonizing IL-6 directly or indirectly
   through JAKI inhibition is expected to provide clinical benefit (Guschin, D., N., et al Embo J
   14:1421, 1995; Smolen, J. S., et al. Lancet 371:987, 2008). Moreover, in some cancers JAKI
   is mutated resulting in constitutive undesirable tumor cell growth and survival (Mullighan
20 CG, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.106:9414-8, 2009; Flex E., et al.J Exp Med. 205:751-8, 2008).
   In other autoimmune diseases and cancers elevated systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines
   that activate JAKI may also contribute to the disease and/or associated symptoms. Therefore,
   patients with such diseases may benefit from JAKI inhibition. Selective inhibitors of JAKI
   may be efficacious while avoiding unnecessary and potentially undesirable effects of
25 inhibiting other JAK kinases.
                                                      58

             Selective inhibitors of JAKI, relative to other JAK kinases, may have multiple
   therapeutic advantages over less selective inhibitors. With respect to selectivity against
   JAK2, a number of important cytokines and growth factors signal through JAK2 including,
   for example, erythropoietin (Epo) and thrombopoietin (Tpo) (Parganas E, et al. Cell. 93:385
 5 95, 1998). Epo is a key growth factor for red blood cells production; hence a paucity of Epo
   dependent signaling can result in reduced numbers of red blood cells and anemia
   (Kaushansky K, NEJM 354:2034-45, 2006). Tpo, another example of a JAK2-dependent
   growth factor, plays a central role in controlling the proliferation and maturation of
   megakaryocytes - the cells from which platelets are produced (Kaushansky K, NEJM
10 354:2034-45, 2006). As such, reduced Tpo signaling would decrease megakaryocyte numbers
   (megakaryocytopenia) and lower circulating platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). This can
   result in undesirable and/or uncontrollable bleeding. Reduced inhibition of other JAKs, such
   as JAK3 and Tyk2, may also be desirable as humans lacking functional version of these
   kinases have been shown to suffer from numerous maladies such as severe-combined
15 immunodeficiency or hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (Minegishi, Y, et al. Immunity
   25:745-55, 2006; Macchi P, et al. Nature. 377:65-8, 1995). Therefore a JAKI inhibitor with
   reduced affinity for other JAKs would have significant advantages over a less-selective
   inhibitor with respect to reduced side effects involving immune suppression, anemia and
   thrombocytopenia.
20          Another aspect of the present invention pertains to methods of treating a JAK
   associated disease or disorder in an individual (e.g., patient) by administering to the
   individual in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount or dose of a compound
   of the present invention or a pharmaceutical composition thereof. A JAK-associated disease
   can include any disease, disorder or condition that is directly or indirectly linked to expression
25 or activity of the JAK, including overexpression and/or abnormal activity levels. A JAK
   associated disease can also include any disease, disorder or condition that can be prevented,
   ameliorated, or cured by modulating JAK activity.
            Examples of JAK-associated diseases include diseases involving the immune system
   including, for example, organ transplant rejection (e.g., allograft rejection and graft versus
30 host disease).

   such as psoriasis (for example, psoriasis vulgaris), atopic dermatitis, skin rash., skin irritation,
   skin sensitization (e.g., contact dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis). For example, certain
20 substances including some pharmaceuticals when topically applied can cause skin
   sensitization. In some embodiments, co-administration or sequential administration of at least
   one JAK inhibitor of the invention together with the agent causing unwanted sensitization can
   be helpful in treating such unwanted sensitization or dermatitis. In some embodiments, the
   skin disorder is treated by topical administration of at least one JAK inhibitor of the

   as, for example, those described in WO 2006/056399, which is incorporated herein by
20 reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is a
   tetracycline derivative (e.g., minocycline or doxycline). In some embodiments, the additional
   therapeutic agent binds to FKBP12.
            In some embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is an alkylating agent or DNA
   cross-linking agent; an anti-metabolite/demethylating agent (e.g., 5-flurouracil, capecitabine
25 or azacitidine); an anti-hormone therapy (e.g., hormone receptor antagonists, SERMs, or
   aromotase inhibitor); a mitotic inhibitor (e.g. vincristine or paclitaxel); an topoisomerase (I or
   II) inhibitor (e.g. mitoxantrone and irinotecan); an apoptotic inducers (e.g. ABT-737); a
   nucleic acid therapy (e.g. antisense or RNAi); nuclear receptor ligands (e.g., agonists and/or
   antagonists: all-trans retinoic acid or bexarotene); epigenetic targeting agents such as histone
30 deacetylase inhibitors (e.g. vorinostat), hypomethylating agents (e.g. decitabine); regulators of
   protein stability such as Hsp90 inhibitors, ubiquitin and/or ubiquitin like conjugating or
   deconjugating molecules; or an EGFR inhibitor (erlotinib).
            In some embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent(s) are demulcent eye drops
   (also known as "artificial tears"), which include, but are not limited to, compositions
35 containing polyvinylalcohol, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, glycerin, polyethylene glycol
                                                   67

   (e.g. PEG400)., or carboxymethyl cellulose. Artificial tears can help in the treatment of dry
   eye by compensating for reduced moistening and lubricating capacity of the tear film. In
   some embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is a mucolytic drug, such as N-acetyl
   cysteine, which can interact with the mucoproteins and, therefore, to decrease the viscosity of
 5 the tear film.
            In some embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent includes an antibiotic,
   antiviral, antifungal, anesthetic, anti-inflammatory agents including steroidal and non
   steroidal anti-inflammatories, and anti-allergic agents. Examples of suitable medicaments

   lodoxamide; levocabastin; naphazoline; antazoline; pheniramine; or azalide antibiotic.
   PharnaceuticalFormulationsand Dosage Forms
            When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the invention can be
20 administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions can be
   prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art, and can be administered by a
   variety of routes, depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the
   area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including transdermal, epidermal,
   ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including intranasal, vaginal and rectal delivery),
25 pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer;
   intratracheal or intranasal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous,
   intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal intramuscular or injection or infusion; or
   intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. Parenteral administration can
   be in the form of a single bolus dose, or may be, for example, by a continuous perfusion
30 pump. Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include
   transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and
   powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners
   and the like may be necessary or desirable.
            This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the
35 active ingredient, the compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
                                                     68

   thereof, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (excipients).
   In some embodiments, the composition is suitable for topical administration. In making the
   compositions of the invention, the active ingredient is typically mixed with an excipient,
   diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier in the form of, for example, a
 5 capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a
   solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active
   ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges,
   sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a
   liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active
10 compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and
   sterile packaged powders.
             In preparing a formulation, the active compound can be milled to provide the
   appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound
   is substantially insoluble, it can be milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active
15 compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size can be adjusted by milling to
   provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g. about 40 mesh.
             The compounds of the invention may be milled using known milling procedures such
   as wet milling to obtain a particle size appropriate for tablet formation and for other
   formulation types. Finely divided (nanoparticulate) preparations of the compounds of the
20 invention can be prepared by processes known in the art, e.g., see International App. No. WO
   2002/000196.
             Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol,
   mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium
   silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, and methyl
25 cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc,
   magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents;
   preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and
   flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick,
   sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by
30 employing procedures known in the art.
             In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises silicified
   microcrystalline cellulose (SMCC) and at least one compound described herein, or a
   pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In some embodiments, the silicified
   microcrystalline cellulose comprises about 98% microcrystalline cellulose and about 2%
35 silicon dioxide w/w.
                                                    69

            In some embodiments, the composition is a sustained release composition comprising
   at least one compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and at
   least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, the composition
   comprises at least one compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
 5 thereof, and at least one component selected from microcrystalline cellulose, lactose
   monohydrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and polyethylene oxide. In some
   embodiments, the composition comprises at least one compound described herein, or a
   pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate,
   and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. In some embodiments, the composition comprises at
10 least one compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and
   microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, and polyethylene oxide. In some
   embodiments, the composition further comprises magnesium stearate or silicon dioxide. In
   some embodiments, the microcrystalline cellulose is Avicel PH102TM. In some embodiments,
   the lactose monohydrate is Fast-flo  316TM.  In some embodiments, the hydroxypropyl
15 methylcellulose is hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2208 K4M (e.g., Methocel K4 M
   PremierM) and/or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2208 KI00LV (e.g., Methocel K00LVTM).
   In some embodiments, the polyethylene oxide is polyethylene oxide WSR 1105 (e.g., Polyox
   WSR 1105TM).
            In some embodiments, a wet granulation process is used to produce the composition.
20 In some embodiments, a dry granulation process is used to produce the composition.
            The compositions can be formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing
   from about 5 to about 1,000 mg (1 g), more usually about 100 mg to about 500 mg, of the
   active ingredient. In some embodiments, each dosage contains about 10 mg of the active
   ingredient. In some embodiments, each dosage contains about 50 mg of the active ingredient.
25 In some embodiments, each dosage contains about 25 mg of the active ingredient. The term
   "unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human
   subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material
   calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable
   pharmaceutical excipient.
30          In some embodiments, the compositions of the invention contain from about 5 mg to
   about 50 mg of the active ingredient. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that
   this embodies compounds or compositions containing about 5 mg to about 10 mg, about 10
   mg to about 15 mg, about 15 mg to about 20 mg, about 20 mg to about 25 mg, about 25 mg to
   about 30 mg, about 30 mg to about 35 mg, about 35 mg to about 40 mg, about 40 mg to about
35 45 mg, or about 45 ing to about 50 mg of the active ingredient.
                                                  70

            In some embodiments, the compositions of the invention contain from about 50 mg to
   about 500 mg of the active ingredient. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that
   this embodies compounds or compositions containing about 50 mg to about 100 mg, about
   100 mg to about 150 mg, about 150 mg to about 200 mg, about 200 mg to about 250 ing,
 5 about 250 mg to about 300 mg, about 350 mg to about 400 mg, or about 450 mg to about 500
   mg of the active ingredient.
            In some embodiments, the compositions of the invention contain from about 500 mg
   to about 1,000 mg of the active ingredient. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate
   that this embodies compounds or compositions containing about 500 mg to about 550 mg,
10 about 550 mg to about 600 mg, about 600 mg to about 650 mg, about 650 mg to about 700
   mg, about 700 mg to about 750 mg, about 750 mg to about 800 mg, about 800 mg to about
   850 mg, about 850 mg to about 900 mg, about 900 mg to about 950 mg. or about 950 mg to
   about 1,000 mg of the active ingredient.
            The active compound may be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally
15 administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the
   amount of the compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician,
   according to the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen
   route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of
   the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.
20          For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is
   mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing
   a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these
   preformulation compositions as homogeneous, the active ingredient is typically dispersed
   evenly throughout the composition so that the composition can be readily subdivided into
25 equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid
   preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above
   containing from, for example, about 0.1 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the
   present invention.
            The tablets or pills of the present invention can be coated or otherwise compounded
30 to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet
   or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the
   form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric
   layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to
   pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used
35 for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and
                                                    71

   mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose
   acetate.
             The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions of the present invention
   can be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions,
 5 suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils
   such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar
   pharmaceutical vehicles.
             Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in
   pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders.
10 The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients
   as described supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or
   nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in can be nebulized by use
   of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the
   nebulizing device can be attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure
15 breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions can be administered orally
   or nasally from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.
             Topical formulations can contain one or more conventional carriers. In some
   embodiments, ointments can contain water and one or more hydrophobic carriers selected
   from, for example, liquid paraffin, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, propylene glycol, white
20 Vaseline, and the like. Carrier compositions of creams can be based on water in combination
   with glycerol and one or more other components, e.g. glycerinemonostearate, PEG
   glycerinemonostearate and cetylstearyl alcohol. Gels can be formulated using isopropyl
   alcohol and water, suitably in combination with other components such as, for example,
   glycerol, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and the like. In some embodiments, topical formulations
25 contain at least about 0.1, at least about 0.25, at least about 0.5, at least about 1, at least about
   2, or at least about 5 wt % of the compound of the invention. The topical formulations can be
   suitably packaged in tubes of, for example, 100 g which are optionally associated with
   instructions for the treatment of the select indication, e.g., psoriasis or other skin condition.
             The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary
30 depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as
   prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In
   therapeutic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient already suffering from
   a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the
   disease and its complications. Effective doses will depend on the disease condition being
                                                    72

   treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as
   the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like.
             The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical
   compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional
 5 sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use
   as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier
   prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and
   11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use
   of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of
10 pharmaceutical salts.
             The therapeutic dosage of a compound of the present invention can vary according to,
   for example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration
   of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing
   physician. The proportion or concentration of a compound of the invention in a
15 pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a number of factors including dosage,
   chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and the route of administration. For example,
   the compounds of the invention can be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution
   containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for parenteral administration. Some
   typical dose ranges are from about I tg/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some
20 embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight
   per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of
   progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the
   relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its
   route of administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves
25 derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.
             The compositions of the invention can further include one or more additional
   pharmaceutical agents such as a chemotherapeutic, steroid, anti-inflammatory compound, or
   immunosuppressant, examples of which are listed hereinabove.
             In some embodiments, the compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is
30 administered as an ophthalmic composition. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the methods
   comprise administration of the compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and an
   ophthalmically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is a
   liquid composition, semi-solid composition, insert, film, microparticles or nanoparticles.
             In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is a liquid composition. In some
35 embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is a semi-solid composition. In some
                                                    73

   embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is a topical composition. The topical compositions
   include, but are not limited to liquid and semi-solid compositions. In some embodiments, the
   ophthalmic composition is a topical composition. In some embodiments, the topical
   composition comprises aqueous solution, an aqueous suspension, an ointment or a gel. In
 5 some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is topically applied to the front of the eye,
   under the upper eyelid, on the lower eyelid and in the cul-de-sac. In some embodiments, the
   ophthalmic composition is sterilized. The sterilization can be accomplished by known
   techniques like sterilizing filtration of the solution or by heating of the solution in the
   ampoule ready for use. The ophthalmic compositions of the invention can further contain
10 pharmaceutical excipients suitable for the preparation of ophthalmic formulations. Examples
   of such excipients are preserving agents, buffering agents, chelating agents, antioxidant
   agents and salts for regulating the osmotic pressure.
            As used herein, the term "ophthalmically acceptable carrier" refers to any material
   that can contain and release the compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and
15 that is compatible with the eye. In some embodiments, the ophthalnically acceptable carrier
   is water or an aqueous solution or suspension, but also includes oils such as those used to
   make ointments and polymer matrices such as used in ocular inserts. In some embodiments,
   the composition may be an aqueous suspension comprising the compound, or
   pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Liquid ophthalmic compositions, including both
20 ointments and suspensions, may have a viscosity that is suited for the selected route of
   administration. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition has a viscosity in the
   range of from about 1,000 to about 30,000 centipoise.
            In some embodiments, the ophthalmic compositions may further comprise one or
   more of surfactants, adjuvants, buffers, antioxidants, tonicity adjusters, preservatives (e.g.,
25 EDTA, BAK (benzalkonium chloride), sodium chlorite, sodium perborate, polyquaterium-1),
   thickeners or viscosity modifiers (e.g., carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose,
   polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, glycol 400, propylene glycol hydroxymethyl
   cellulose, hydroxpropyl-guar, hyaluronic acid, and hydroxypropyl cellulose) and the like.
   Additives in the formulation may include, but are not limited to, sodium chloride, sodium
30 bicarbonate, sorbic acid, methyl paraben, propyl paraben, chlorhexidine, castor oil, and
   sodium perborate.
            Aqueous ophthalmic compositions (solutions or suspensions) generally do not contain
   physiologically or ophthalmically harmful constituents. In some embodiments, purified or
   deionized water is used in the composition. The pH may be adjusted by adding any
35 physiologically and ophthalmically acceptable pH adjusting acids, bases or buffers to within
                                                     74

   the range of about 5.0 to 8.5. Ophthalmically acceptable examples of acids include acetic,
   boric, citric, lactic, phosphoric, hydrochloric, and the like, and examples of bases include
   sodium hydroxide, sodium phosphate, sodium borate, sodium citrate, sodium acetate, sodium
   lactate, tromethamine, trishydroxymethylamino-methane, and the like. Salts and buffers
 5 include citrate/dextrose, sodium bicarbonate, anmnonium chloride and mixtures of the
   aforementioned acids and bases.
             In some embodiments, the methods involve forming or supplying a depot of the
   therapeutic agent in contact with the external surface of the eye. A depot refers to a source of
   therapeutic agent that is not rapidly removed by tears or other eye clearance mechanisms.
10 This allows for continued, sustained high concentrations of therapeutic agent to be present in
   the fluid on the external surface of the eye by a single application. Without wishing to be
   bound by any theory, it is believed that absorption and penetration may be dependent on both
   the dissolved drug concentration and the contact duration of the external tissue with the drug
   containing fluid. As the drug is removed by clearance of the ocular fluid and/or absorption
15 into the eye tissue, more drug is provided, e.g. dissolved, into the replenished ocular fluid
   from the depot. Accordingly, the use of a depot may more easily facilitate loading of the
   ocular tissue for more insoluble therapeutic agents. In some embodiments, the depot can
   remain for up to eight hours or more. In some embodiments, the ophthalmic depot forms
   includes, but is not limited to, aqueous polymeric suspensions, ointments, and solid inserts.
20           In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition is an ointment or gel. In some
   embodiment, the ophthalmic composition is an oil-based delivery vehicle. In some
   embodiments, the composition comprises a petroleum or lanolin base to which is added the
   active ingredient, usually as 0.1 to 2%, and excipients. Common bases may include, but are
   not limited to, mineral oil, petrolatum and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the
25 ointment is applied as a ribbon onto the lower eyelid.
             In some embodiment, the ophthalmic composition is an ophthalmic insert. In some
   embodiments, the ophthalmic insert is biologically inert, soft, bio-erodible, viscoelastic, stable
   to sterilization after exposure to therapeutic agents, resistant to infections from air borne
   bacteria, bio- erodible, biocompatible, and/or viscoelastic. In some embodiments, the insert
30 comprises an ophthalmically acceptable matrix, e.g., a polymer matrix. The matrix is
   typically a polymer and the therapeutic agent is generally dispersed therein or bonded to the
   polymer matrix. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent may be slowly released from the
   matrix through dissolution or hydrolysis of the covalent bond. In some embodiments, the
   polymer is bioerodible (soluble) and the dissolution rate thereof can control the release rate of
35 the therapeutic agent dispersed therein. In another form, the polymer matrix is a
                                                    75

   biodegradable polymer that breaks down such as by hydrolysis to thereby release the
   therapeutic agent bonded thereto or dispersed therein. In further embodiments, the matrix and
   therapeutic agent can be surrounded with an additional polymeric coating to further control
   release. In some embodiments, the insert comprises a biodegradable polymer such as
 5 polycaprolactone (PCL), an ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), polyalkyl
   cyanoacrylate, polyurethane, a nylon, or poly (dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), or a
   copolymer of any of these. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is dispersed into the
   matrix material or dispersed amongst the monomer composition used to make the matrix
   material prior to polymerization. In some embodiments, the amount of therapeutic agent is
10 from about 0.1 to about 50%, or from about 2 to about 20%. In further embodiments, the
   biodegradable or bioerodible polymer matrix is used so that the spent insert does not have to
   be removed. As the biodegradable or bioerodible polymer is degraded or dissolved, the
   therapeutic agent is released.
            In further embodiments, the ophthalmic insert comprises a polymer, including, but
15 are not limited to, those described in Wagh, et al., "Polymers used in ocular dosage form and
   drug delivery systems", Asian J. Pharm., pages 12-17 (Jan. 2008), which is incorporated
   herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the insert comprises a polymer
   selected from polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), an acrylate or methacrylate polymer or copolymer
   (e.g., Eudragit@ family of polymers from Rohm or Degussa), hydroxymethyl cellulose,
20 polyacrylic acid, poly(amidoamine) dendrimers, poly(dimethyl siloxane), polyethylene oxide,
   poly(lactide-co-glycolide), poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate), poly(vinyl alcohol), or
   poly(propylene fumarate). In some embodiments, the insert comprises Gelfoam@ R. In some

   Labeled Compounds andAssay Methods
              Another aspect of the present invention relates to labeled compounds of the invention
   (radio-labeled, fluorescent-labeled, etc.) that would be useful not only in imaging techniques
   but also in assays, both in vitro and in vivo, for localizing and quantitating JAK in tissue
20 samples, including human, and for identifying JAK ligands by inhibition binding of a labeled
   compound. Accordingly, the present invention includes JAK assays that contain such labeled
   compounds.
              The present invention further includes isotopically-labeled compounds of the
   invention. An "isotopically" or "radio-labeled" compound is a compound of the invention
25 where one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or
   mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature (i.e.,
   naturally occurring). Suitable radionuclides that may be incorporated in compounds of the
   present invention include but are not limited to 3H (also written as T for tritium),                 3    4
                                                                                                  1C, 1 C, 1 C,

30 radionuclide that is incorporated in the instant radio-labeled compounds will depend on the
   specific application of that radio-labeled compound. For example, for in vitro JAK labeling
   and competition assays, compounds that incorporate 3H, 4 C,         82Br, 12 5

            It is to be understood that a "radio-labeled " or "labeled compound" is a compound
   that has incorporated at least one radionuclide. In some embodiments the radionuclide is
   selected from the group consisting of 3H,    14
                                                   C, 1251, 35S and 82
                                                                      Br. In some embodiments, the
   compound incorporates 1, 2, or 3 deuterium atoms.
 5          The present invention can further include synthetic methods for incorporating radio
   isotopes into compounds of the invention. Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes
   into organic compounds are well known in the art, and an ordinary skill in the art will readily
   recognize the methods applicable for the compounds of invention.
            A labeled compound of the invention can be used in a screening assay to
10 identify/evaluate compounds. For example, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e.,
   test compound) which is labeled can be evaluated for its ability to bind a JAK by monitoring
   its concentration variation when contacting with the JAK, through tracking of the labeling.
   For example, a test compound (labeled) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of
   another compound which is known to bind to a JAK (i.e., standard compound). Accordingly,
15 the ability of a test compound to compete with the standard compound for binding to the JAK
   directly correlates to its binding affinity. Conversely, in some other screening assays, the
   standard compound is labeled and test compounds are unlabeled. Accordingly, the
   concentration of the labeled standard compound is monitored in order to evaluate the
   competition between the standard compound and the test compound, and the relative binding
20 affinity of the test compound is thus ascertained.
   Kits
            The present invention also includes pharmaceutical kits useful, for example, in the
   treatment or prevention of JAK-associated diseases or disorders, such as cancer, which
25 include one or more containers containing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a
   therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Such kits can further
   include, if desired, one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such
   as, for example, containers with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional
   containers, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Instructions, either as
30 inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be administered, guidelines for
   administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the components, can also be included in the kit.
            The invention will be described in greater detail by way of specific examples. The
   following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the
   invention in any manner. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of non
35 critical parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results.

   The compounds of the Examples have been found to be JAK inhibitors according to at least
   one assay described herein.

   Example A: In vitro JAK Kinase Assay
            Compounds herein were tested for inhibitory activity of JAK targets according to the
   following in vitro assay described in Park et al., Analytical Biochemistry 1999, 269, 94-104.
   The catalytic domains of human JAKI (a.a. 837-1142), JAK2 (a.a. 828-1132) and JAK3 (a.a.
10 781-1124) were expressed using baculovirus in insect cells and purified. The catalytic activity
   of JAKI, JAK2 or JAK3 was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of a biotinylated
   peptide. The phosphorylated peptide was detected by homogenous time resolved fluorescence
   (HTRF). IC5os of compounds were measured for each kinase in the 40 pL reactions that
   contain the enzyme, ATP and 500 nM peptide in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.8) buffer with 100 mM
15 NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 0.1 mg/mL (0.01%) BSA. For the 1 mM IC5o measurements, ATP
   concentration in the reactions was 1 mM. Reactions were carried out at room temperature for
   1 hour and then stopped with 20 pL 45 mM EDTA, 300 nM SA-APC, 6 nM Eu-Py20 in assay
   buffer (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA). Binding to the Europium labeled antibody took place for
   40 minutes and HTRF signal was measured on a PHERA star plate reader (BMG, Cary, NC).
20 The Example compounds were each tested in the Example A assay (see Table 1 for data for
   the compounds of the examples as tested by the assay of Example A at 1 mM ATP).

10         Example B: Cellular Assays
           Cancer cell lines dependent on cytokines and hence JAK/STAT signal transduction,
   for growth, can be plated at 6000 cells per well (96 well plate format) in RPMI 1640, 10%
   FBS, and 1 nG/mL of appropriate cytokine. Compounds can be added to the cells in
                                                 186

   DMSO/media (final concentration 0.2% DMSO) and incubated for 72 hours at 37 'C, 5%
   CO 2. The effect of compound on cell viability is assessed using the CellTiter-Glo
   Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) followed by TopCount (Perkin Elmer, Boston,
   MA) quantitation. Potential off-target effects of compounds are measured in parallel using a
 5 non-JAK driven cell line with the same assay readout. All experiments are typically
   performed in duplicate.
            The above cell lines can also be used to examine the effects of compounds on
   phosphorylation of JAK kinases or potential downstream substrates such as STAT proteins,
   Akt, Shp2, or Erk. These experiments can be performed following an overnight cytokine
10 starvation, followed by a brief preincubation with compound (2 hours or less) and cytokine
   stimulation of approximately 1 hour or less. Proteins are then extracted from cells and
   analyzed by techniques familiar to those schooled in the art including Western blotting or
   ELISAs using antibodies that can differentiate between phosphorylated and total protein.
   These experiments can utilize normal or cancer cells to investigate the activity of compounds
15 on tumor cell survival biology or on mediators of inflammatory disease. For example, with
   regards to the latter, cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, or IFN can be used to stimulate
   JAK activation resulting in phosphorylation of STAT protein(s) and potentially in
   transcriptional profiles (assessed by array or qPCR technology) or production and/or secretion
   of proteins, such as IL-17. The ability of compounds to inhibit these cytokine mediated
20 effects can be measured using techniques common to those schooled in the art. To assess
   compound effects on JAK2, primary cells or cell lines can be stimulated with JAK2
   dependent growth factors such as GM-CSF or Tpo., proteins extracted from cells and analyzed
   by techniques familiar to those schooled in the art including Western blotting or ELISAs
   using antibodies that can differentiate between phosphorylated and total protein.
25          Compounds herein can also be tested in cellular models designed to evaluate their
   potency and activity against mutant JAKs, for example, the JAK2V617F mutation found in
   myeloid proliferative disorders. These experiments often utilize cytokine dependent cells of
   hematological lineage (e.g. BaF/3) into which the wild-type or mutant JAK kinases are
   ectopically expressed (James, C., et al. Nature 434:1144-1148; Staerk, J., et al. JBC
30 280:41893-41899). Endpoints include the effects of compounds on cell survival,
   proliferation, and phosphorylated JAK, STAT, Akt. or Erk proteins.
            Certain compounds herein can be evaluated for their activity inhibiting T-cell
   proliferation. Such as assay can be considered a second cytokine (i.e. JAK) driven
   proliferation assay and also a simplistic assay of immune suppression or inhibition of immune
35 activation. The following is a brief outline of how such experiments can be performed.
                                                   187

   Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are prepared from human whole blood samples
   using Ficoll Hypaque separation method and T-cells (fraction 2000) can be obtained from
   PBMCs by elutriation. Freshly isolated human T-cells can be maintained in culture medium
   (RPMI 1640 supplemented with10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mil penicillin, 100 pg/ml
 5 streptomycin) at a density of 2 x 106 cells/mil at 37 'C for up to 2 days. For IL-2 stimulated
   cell proliferation analysis, T-cells are first treated with Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) at a final
   concentration of 10 gg/mL for 72 hours. After washing once with PBS, 6000 cells/well are
   plated in 96-well plates and treated with compounds at different concentrations in the culture
   medium in the presence of 100 U/mL human IL-2 (ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene; Rehovot,
10 Israel). The plates are incubated at 37 'C for 72h and the proliferation index is assessed using
   CellTiter-Glo Luminescent reagents following the manufactory suggested protocol (Promega;
   Madison, WI).
            Example C: In vivo anti-tumor efficacy
15          Compounds herein can be evaluated in human tumor xenograft models in immune
   compromised mice. For example, a tumorigenic variant of the INA-6 plasmacytoma cell line
   can be used to inoculate SCID mice subcutaneously (Burger, R., et al. Hematol J. 2:42-53,
   2001). Tumor bearing animals can then be randomized into drug or vehicle treatment groups
   and different doses of compounds can be administered by any number of the usual routes
20 including oral, i.p., or continuous infusion using implantable pumps. Tumor growth is
   followed over time using calipers. Further, tumor samples can be harvested at any time after
   the initiation of treatment for analysis as described above (Example B) to evaluate compound
   effects on JAK activity and downstream signaling pathways. In addition, selectivity of the
   compound(s) can be assessed using xenograft tumor models that are driven by other know
25 kinases (e.g. Ber-Abl) such as the K562 tumor model.
            Example D: Murine Skin Contact Delayed Hypersensitivity Response Test
            Compounds herein can also be tested for their efficacies (of inhibiting JAK targets) in
   the T-cell driven murine delayed hypersensitivity test model. The murine skin contact
30 delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response is considered to be a valid model of clinical
   contact dermatitis, and other T-lymphocyte mediated immune disorders of the skin, such as
   psoriasis (Immunol Today. 1998 Jan;19(l):37-44). Murine DTH shares multiple
   characteristics with psoriasis, including the immune infiltrate, the accompanying increase in
   inflammatory cytokines, and keratinocyte hyperproliferation. Furthermore, many classes of
                                                     188

   agents that are efficacious in treating psoriasis in the clinic are also effective inhibitors of the
   DTH response in mice (Agents Actions. 1993 Jan;38(1-2):116-21).
             On Day 0 and 1, Balb/c mice are sensitized with a topical application, to their shaved
   abdomen with the antigen 2.,4,dinitro-fluorobenzene (DNFB). On day 5, ears are measured for
 5 thickness using an engineer's micrometer. This measurement is recorded and used as a
   baseline. Both of the animals' ears are then challenged by a topical application of DNFB in a
   total of 20 gL (10 gL on the internal pinna and 10 gL on the external pinna) at a concentration
   of 0.2%. Twenty-four to seventy-two hours after the challenge, ears are measured again.
   Treatment with the test compounds is given throughout the sensitization and challenge phases
10 (day -1 to day 7) or prior to and throughout the challenge phase (usually afternoon of day 4 to
   day 7). Treatment of the test compounds (in different concentration) is administered either
   systemically or topically (topical application of the treatment to the ears). Efficacies of the
   test compounds are indicated by a reduction in ear swelling comparing to the situation
   without the treatment. Compounds causing a reduction of 20% or more were considered
15 efficacious. In some experiments, the mice are challenged but not sensitized (negative
   control).
             The inhibitive effect (inhibiting activation of the JAK-STAT pathways) of the test
   compounds can be confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Activation of the JAK
   STAT pathway(s) results in the formation and translocation of functional transcription
20 factors. Further, the influx of immune cells and the increased proliferation of keratinocytes
   should also provide unique expression profile changes in the ear that can be investigated and
   quantified. Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded ear sections (harvested after the challenge
   phase in the DTH model) are subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using an antibody
   that specifically interacts with phosphorylated STAT3 (clone 58E12, Cell Signaling
25 Technologies). The mouse ears are treated with test compounds, vehicle, or dexamethasone
   (a clinically efficacious treatment for psoriasis), or without any treatment, in the DTH model
   for comparisons. Test compounds and the dexamethasone can produce similar transcriptional
   changes both qualitatively and quantitatively, and both the test compounds and
   dexamethasone can reduce the number of infiltrating cells. Both systemically and topical
30 administration of the test compounds can produce inhibitive effects, i.e., reduction in the
   number of infiltrating cells and inhibition of the transcriptional changes.
             Example E: In vivo anti-inflammatory activity
             Compounds herein can be evaluated in rodent or non-rodent models designed to
35 replicate a single or complex inflammation response. For instance, rodent models of arthritis
                                                    189

   can be used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of compounds dosed preventatively or
   therapeutically. These models include but are not limited to mouse or rat collagen-induced
   arthritis, rat adjuvant-induced arthritis, and collagen antibody-induced arthritis. Autoimmune
   diseases including, but not limited to, multiple sclerosis, type I-diabetes mellitus,
 5 uveoretinitis, thyroditis, myasthenia gravis, immunoglobulin nephropathies, myocarditis,
   airway sensitization (asthma), lupus, or colitis may also be used to evaluate the therapeutic
   potential of compounds herein. These models are well established in the research community
   and are familiar to those schooled in the art (Current Protocols in Immunology, Vol 3.,
   Coligan, J.E. et al, Wiley Press.; Methods in MolecularBiology: Vol. 225, Inflammation
10 Protocols., Winyard, P.G. and Willoughby, D.A., Humana Press, 2003.).
             Example F: Animal Models for the Treatment of Dry Eye, Uveitis, and
   Conjunctivitis
             Agents may be evaluated in one or more preclinical models of dry eye known to those
15 schooled in the art including, but not limited to, the rabbit concanavalin A (ConA) lacrimal
   gland model, the scopolamine mouse model (subcutaneous or transdermal), the Botulinumn
   mouse lacrimal gland model, or any of a number of spontaneous rodent auto-immune models
   that result in ocular gland dysfunction (e.g. NOD-SCID, MRL/lpr, or NZB/NZW) (Barabino
   et al., Experimental Eye Research 2004, 79, 613-621 and Schrader et al., Developmental
20 Opthalmology, Karger 2008, 41, 298-312, each of which is incorporated herein by reference
   in its entirety). Endpoints in these models may include histopathology of the ocular glands
   and eye (cornea, etc.) and possibly the classic Schirmer test or modified versions thereof
   (Barabino et al.) which measure tear production. Activity may be assessed by dosing via
   multiple routes of administration (e.g. systemic or topical) which may begin prior to or after
25 measurable disease exists.
             Agents may be evaluated in one or more preclinical models of uveitis known to those
   schooled in the art. These include, but are not limited to, models of experimental
   autoinmune uveitis (EAU) and endotoxin induced uveitis (EIU). EAU experiements may be
   performed in the rabbit, rat, or mouse and may involve passive or activate immunization. For
30 instance, any of a number or retinal antigens may be used to sensitize animals to a relevant
   immunogen after which animals may be challenged ocuarly with the same antigen. The EIU
   model is more acute and involves local or systemic administration of lipopolysaccaride at
   sublethal doses. Endpoints for both the EIU and EAU models may include fundoscopic
   exam, histopathology amongst others. These models are reviewed by Smith et al.
35 (Immunology and Cell Biology 1998, 76, 497-512, which is incorporated herein by reference
                                                    190

   in its entirety). Activity is assessed by dosing via multiple routes of administration (e.g.
   systemic or topical) which may begin prior to or after measurable disease exists. Some
   models listed above may also develop scleritis/episcleritis, chorioditis, cyclitis, or iritis and
   are therefore useful in investigating the potential activity of compounds for the therapeutic
 5 treatment of these diseases.
            Agents may also be evaluated in one or more preclinical models of conjunctivitis
   known those schooled in the art. These include, but are not limited to, rodent models utilizing
   guinea-pig, rat, or mouse. The guinea-pig models include those utilizing active or passive
   immunization and/or immune challenge protocols with antigens such as ovalbumin or
10 ragweed (reviewed in Groneberg, D.A., et al., Allergy 2003, 58, 1101-1113, which is
   incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Rat and mouse models are similar in general
   design to those in the guinea-pig (also reviewed by Groneberg). Activity may be assessed by
   dosing via multiple routes of administration (e.g. systemic or topical) which may begin prior
   to or after measurable disease exists. Endpoints for such studies may include, for example,
15 histological, immunological, biochemical, or molecular analysis of ocular tissues such as the
   conjunctiva.
            Example G: In vivo protection of bone
            Compounds may be evaluated in various preclinical models of osteopenia,
20 osteoporosis, or bone resorption known to those schooled in the art. For example,
   ovariectomized rodents may be used to evaluate the ability of compounds to affect signs and
   markers of bone remodeling and/or density (W.S.S. Jee and W. Yao, J Musculoskel. Nueron.
   Interact., 2001, 1(3), 193-207, which is incorporated herein by reference in its
   entirety). Alternatively, bone density and architecture may be evaluated in control or
25 compound treated rodents in models of therapy (e.g. glucocorticoid) induced osteopenia (Yao,
   et al. Arthritis and Rheumatism, 2008, 58(6), 3485-3497; and id. 58(11), 1674-1686, both of
   which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In addition, the effects of
   compounds on bone resorption and density may be evaluable in the rodent models of arthritis
   discussed above (Example E). Endpoints for all these models may vary but often include
30 histological and radiological assessments as well as immunohisotology and appropriate
   biochemical markers of bone remodeling.
            Various modifications of the invention, in addition to those described herein, will be
   apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description. Such modifications are also
   intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. Each reference, including all patent,
