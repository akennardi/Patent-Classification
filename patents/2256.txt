           Spacer Parts carrying element
           The present invention relates to a spacer parts carrying element
   provided for being mounted on a pedestal for raising a surface, which
   carrying element comprises a plate having an upper face and a lower
 5 face, said spacer parts being placed on the upper face in such a manner
   as to extend upwards as from this upper face, said lower face being
   provided with a set of legs provided for gripping into an opening applied
   in a carrying surface of the pedestal, said legs of said set being applied
   around a perforation extending from the upper towards the lower face.
10         Such a spacer parts carrying element is known from the patent
   application WO 99/23327 and is marketed by the applicant. The spacer
   parts carrying element is provided for being mounted on a pedestal for
   raising a surface, which pedestal himself serves, among others, for
   compensating an inclination of the surface on which the pedestal is
15 placed. The spacer parts are placed on the upper face of the carrying
   element, in such a manner as to extend upwards as from this upper face.
   The spacer parts can thus be lodged in a space between two adjacent
   tiles applied on the upper surface of the pedestal. The spacer parts thus
   maintain a distance between two adjacent tiles. The set off legs will cross
20 the opening applied in the support surface of the pedestal and thus
   enable to fix the carrying element on the pedestal.
           A drawback of the known carrying element is that in case of heavy
   wind blasts, for example in the range of 80km/h or more, the carrying
   element can loose from the pedestal and can thus disturb the positioning
25 of the tiles on the pedestal.
           It is an object of the invention to realise a spacer parts carrying
   element which can be better fixed on the pedestal and thus reduces the
   probability that it loses in case of heavy wind blasts.
           To this purpose a spacer parts carrying element according to the
30 invention is characterised in that each leg comprises a base part and a
   head part connected among each other by an intermediate part, the head

                                         -2
   part having a width (L1) smaller than the one (L2) of the base part, the
   head part having a width larger than the one (L3) of the intermediate part,
   the head part extending along a border of a space extending in an
   extension of the perforation. The fact that the head part extends along a
 5 border of a space, which extends in the extension of the perforation,
   enables a fixing screw, which would be screwed into the perforation as
   from the upper face of the plate, to grip in that head part of each leg.
   Because the intermediate part has a width smaller than the one of the
   head part, this will enable the head part to pivot with respect to the base
10 part when the fixing screw will penetrate within that space. Indeed, the
   force transmitted to the head part by the fixing screw when moving within
   this space situated in the extension of the perforation, will on its turn be
   transmitted    at the    intermediate    part. The smaller width     of this
   intermediate part will enable, under the effect of this force, a hinging of
15 the head parts and the intermediate parts. This hinging will have as
   consequence that the legs will spread in order to occupy a larger volume
   under the lower face of the carrying element and thus will oppose a
   pulling away of carrying element from the pedestal on which it will be
   fixed.
20         A first preferred embodiment of a spacer parts carrying element
   according to the invention is characterised in that the head part
   comprises a first circumference having a first segment, a second
   segment and a third segment, the first segment facing said space, which
   first segment comprises a curved profile matching the one of said space,
25 a first end of said first segment being connected by means of a first
   liaison segment to the second segment, a second end of the first
   segment, opposite the first end, is connected to the third segment by
   means of a second liaison segment. The curved profile of the first
   segment can thus be aligned with the space situated in the extension of
30 the perforation and will enable to the fixing screw to correctly grip in the
   head part.

                                       -3
           A second embodiment of a spacer parts carrying element
   according to the invention is characterised in that the base part
   comprises a second circumference having a fourth segment, a fifth
   segment and a sixth segment, the fourth segment forms an exterior
 5 border of the leg, a first end of the fourth segment being connected by
   means of a third liaison segment to the fifth segment, a second end of
   the fourth segment, opposite to the first end, being connected to the sixth
   segment by a fourth liaison segment. This facilitates the penetration of
   the carrying element into the perforation.
10         Preferably each leg has a length situated between 0.7 and 1.2 cm,
   in particular 1 cm. This enables a sufficient contact surface with the fixing
   screw.
           The invention will now be described in more details with respect to
   the drawings illustrating an embodiment of a spacer parts carrying
15 element provided for being mounted on a pedestal for raising a surface.
   In the drawings:
           Figure 1 shows a pedestal for raising a surface provided with a
   spacer parts carrying element;
           Figure 2 shows a side view of a spacer parts carrying element
20 according to the invention;
           Figure 3 shows a cross-section view through a spacer parts
   carrying element according to the invention;
           Figure 4 shows a detailed view, at an enlarged scale, of a set of
   legs; and
25         Figure 5 shows, at an enlarged scale, a leg of a set of legs.
           In the drawings a same refence sign has been allotted to a same
   or analogous element.
           Figure 1 shows a pedestal 1 for raising a surface and provided
   with a spacer parts 3 carrying element 2. The spacer parts carrying
30 element comprises a plate 4 and is provided for being detachably
   mounted on the pedestal. It serves to maintain a distance between tiles

                                         -4
   (not shown in the figure) and of which a corner rests on the pedestal 1.
   The carrying element preferably comprises four spacer parts 3 as
   generally corners of four tiles will be placed on the pedestal. The spacer
   parts are placed on the upper face 5 (see figure 2) of the plate of the
 5 carrying element in such a manner as to extend upwards as from this
   upper face. Thus, the spacer parts can extend in a space between two
   adjacent tiles of which a corner is placed on the pedestal and serve for
   maintaining the distance between those adjacent tiles.
          As illustrated in figure 2, the carrying element also comprises a
10 lower face 6 which is provided with a set of legs 7 provided for crossing
   an opening applied in the support surface of the pedestal. The legs of the
   set of legs are applied around a perforation 8 (see figure 3), which
   extends from the upper face towards the lower face of the plate.
   Preferably the set of legs comprises four legs.
15        Preferably the set of legs is placed on a washer 16, the washer
   and the set of legs being manufactured in the same material as the one
   of the set. The washer enables to retain the carrying element in the
   pedestal.
          The carrying element is preferably made in polypropylene and by
20 moulding. Polypropylene is generally used for manufacturing pedestals
   and offers the advantage of being cheap, humidity resistant and poorly
   sensible to temperature fluctuations.
          As illustrated in the figures 4 and 5, each leg 10 comprises a base
   part 11 and a head part 12 connected to each other by an intermediate
25 part 13. The head part 12 having a width Li smaller than the one L2 of
   the base part 11. The head part having a width Li larger than the one L3
   of the intermediate part. The head part of each leg extends along of a
   circumference of the space 14, which extends in the extension of the
   perforation 8. In such a manner the head part can directly come in
30 contact with a fixing screw (not shown in the drawings) which will be
   screwed in the perforation and will extend in that extension, as will be

                                          -5
   described in more details hereunder. Preferably each leg has a length
   situated between 0.7 and 1.2 cm, in particular 1 cm. This enables to have
   sufficient material present in which the fixing screw will be able to
   penetrate.
 5         Preferably the head part 12 has a first circumference comprising a
   first segment f1 and a second segment f2. The first circumference also
   comprises a third segment f3. The first segment f1 faces the space 14
   situated in the extension of the perforation 8. The first segment f1 has a
   curved profile, which matches the one of said space. A first end of the
10 first segment f1 is connected by means of a first liaison segment f4 to the
   second segment f2. The first liaison segment f4 forms an obtuse angle
   with the first segment f1. A second end of the first segment f1, opposite
   to the first end, is connected to the third segment f3 by means of a
   second liaison element f5. The latter also forms an obtuse angle with the
15 first segment f1. The obtuse angles enable the head part to have a
   surface which opens as from the first segment. The first and second
   liaison segments also form part of the circumference of the head part.
            The first and the second end of the first segment are preferably
   rounded in order to facilitate a demoulding when manufacturing the
20 carrying elements by moulding. The same applies to the ends of the
   second f2 and third f3 segment, which are connected by their respective
   liaison segment. The second and third segment also form a substantially
   right angle with the first f4, respectively the second f5, liaison segment.
           The base part 11 preferably has a second circumference having a
25 fourth segment f6 and a fifth segment f7. The second circumference also
   comprises a sixth segment f8. The fourth segment forms an external
   border of the leg. A first end of the fourth segment f6 is connected by
   means of a third liaison segment f9 to the fifth segment f7. The third
   liaison segment f9 forms a substantially right angle with the fourth
30 segment f6. A second end of the fourth segment f6, opposite the first
   end, is connected to the sixth segment f8 by a fourth liaison segment f10.

                                         -6
   The latter also forms a substantially right angle with the fourth segment
   f6.
           Just as for the head segment, the ends of the segments of the
   base part are preferably rounded for facilitating demoulding. The fifth and
 5 the sixth segments are preferably curved towards the interior of the base
   segment for rigidifying the structure of the base part and thus for
   enabling to increase the width of the intermediate part thereby giving it
   more stroke with respect to the base part. The base part serves
   essentially as support for the head part and is for that raison of a larger
10 width than the one of the head part.
           Preferably the base part has a foot 15, which extend as from the
   fourth segment f6. Preferably the foot comprises an angular extremity.
   The foot facilitates the entering of the leg into the perforation 8 while
   mounting the carrying element on the pedestal.
15         For mounting the carrying element on the pedestal one will pass
   the set of legs into an opening foreseen in the support surface of the
   pedestal. The presence of the foot 15 facilitates this introduction as it
   contributes to bring the legs together among each other. The carrying
   element will be pushed into the opening of the pedestal until the washer
20 16 will be housed in this opening. For improving the fixing of the carrying
   element on the pedestal and thus prevent that strong wind blasts would
   remove that carrying element, a fixing screw will be introduced in the
   perforation 8. The fact that the fixing screw is screwed into the
   perforation will cause that this fixing screw will enter in contact with the
25 head part 12 and more particularly with the first segment f1. The curved
   form of the first segment will facilitate the grip of the screw thread of the
   fixing screw with that first segment. The fact the first segment is
   connected to the intermediate segment 13 will cause that the first
   segment will be able to hinge with respect to the intermediate segment
30 and thus enable the fixing screw to well anchor in that part head part.
   This good anchoring and the flexibility of the head part enable on their

                                       -7
  turn that the fixing screw will cause the legs to be spread with respect to
  the perforation and thus contribute to better retain the carrying element in
  the opening of the pedestal.
