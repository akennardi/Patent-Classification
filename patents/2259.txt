                                           TECHNICAL FIELD
   [0001]       The present disclosure relates to the communications field, and in particular, to an
 5 information transmission method, apparatus, and system.
                                             BACKGROUND
   [0002]       In Long Term Evolution (LTE) based cost-effective Machine Type Communication
   (MTC), coverage enhancement needs to be performed on coverage of an LTE network, so as to
   ensure that user equipment (UE) can reliably communicate with a base station when the UE is in a
 0 basement or channel quality is poor. In an existing LTE or LTE-A (LTE Advanced) system,
   time-domain resources are divided as radio frames, and the radio frames are numbered 0 to 1023.
   One radio frame includes 10 subframes, a time length of one subframe is 1 millisecond (1 ms), and
   subframes in each radio frame are numbered 0 to 9. In the existing LTE or LTE-A system, a
   physical broadcast channel (PBCH) for carrying one time of transmission of an master information
 5 block (MIB), a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) for scheduling one time of
   transmission of an system information block type 1 (SIB 1), a physical downlink shared channel
   (PDSCH) for carrying one time of transmission of the SIB 1, a PDCCH for scheduling one time of
   transmission of system information (SI), and a PDSCH for carrying one time of transmission of the
   SI are all transmitted in one subframe.
20 [0003]       In the case of coverage enhancement, the base station may transmit MIB information
   multiple times to improve transmission reliability of an MIB, and a PBCH for carrying multiple
   times of transmission of the MIB may be referred to as an enhanced PBCH. Similarly, the base
   station may transmit control information multiple times to improve transmission reliability of the
   control information, and a PDCCH for carrying multiple times of transmission of the control
25 information may be referred to as an enhanced PDCCH; the base station may transmit data multiple
   times to improve transmission reliability of the data, and a PDSCH for carrying multiple times of
   transmission of the data is referred to as an enhanced PDSCH. The data herein includes, but is not
   limited to, an SIB 1, SI, another SIB, unicast data, a paging message, a random access response, or
   other common data.

   [0004]      In the existing LTE or LTE-A system, a time division duplex (TDD) configuration is
   included in an SIB 1, where which subframes are special subframes and configurations of the
   special   subframes are determined in the TDD configuration;                and an multicast-broadcast
   single-frequency network (MBSFN) subframe configuration is included in an SIB 2, and system
 5 information (SI) cannot be transmitted in a special subframe or an MBSFN subframe. However, in
   the case of coverage enhancement, UE that requires coverage enhancement cannot learn the TDD
   configuration and the MBSFN subframe configuration before receiving the SIB 1 and the SIB 2.
   Therefore, when enhanced transmission is performed on first information, a subframe used in the
   enhanced transmission cannot be determined, thereby lowering transmission reliability of the first
 0 information. The first information may be a master information block, an SIB including a TDD
   configuration, or an SIB including an MBSFN subframe configuration. The enhanced transmission
   may be repeated transmission, spread spectrum transmission, transmission time interval bundling
   transmission, power increased transmission, or retransmission.

30 [0159]      The following clearly describes the technical solutions in the embodiments of the present
   disclosure with reference to the accompanying drawings in the embodiments of the present
   disclosure. Apparently, the described embodiments are merely some but not all of the embodiments
   of the present disclosure. All other embodiments obtained by a person of ordinary skill in the art
                                                      36

   based on the embodiments of the present disclosure without creative efforts shall fall within the
   protection scope of the present disclosure.
   [0160]      A network device described in the embodiments of the present disclosure may be a base
   station, or may be a network device such as a router, a gateway, or a mobility management entity.
 5 An information transmission device described in the embodiments of the present disclosure may be
   user equipment, or may be another device that can be configured to transmit information. The
   present disclosure sets no limitations thereto. For the present disclosure, specific embodiments of
   the present disclosure are described by using an example in which the network device is a base
   station and the information transmission device is user equipment. In addition, enhanced
 0 transmission mentioned in the present disclosure may be one or more types of transmission in
   repeated transmission, spread spectrum transmission, transmission time interval bundling
   transmission, power increased transmission, or retransmission, which is not limited in the present
   disclosure.
                                               Embodiment 1
 5 [0161]      This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method.
   As shown in FIG. 1, the method includes:
   [0162]      S101: A base station determines a subframe for enhanced transmission of first
   information.
   [0163]      Coverage enhancement needs to be performed on coverage of an LTE network, so as to
 0 ensure that user equipment can reliably communicate with the base station when the user equipment
   is in a basement or channel quality is poor. In an existing LTE or LTE-A system, a PBCH for
   carrying one time of transmission of an MIB, a PDCCH for scheduling one time of transmission of
   an SIB 1, a PDSCH for carrying one time of transmission of the SIB 1, a PDCCH for scheduling
   one time of transmission of SI, and a PDSCH for carrying one time of transmission of the SI are all
25 transmitted in one subframe. In the existing LTE or LTE-A system, the user equipment performs
   channel measurement by using a CSI-RS. The base station performs CSI-RS configuration and
   CSI-RS subframe configuration for the user equipment by using dedicated signaling, so that the
   user equipment learns which subframes a CSI-RS is transmitted in and also learns a configuration
   of the CSI-RS.
30 [0164]      In the case of coverage enhancement, MIB information may be transmitted multiple
   times to improve transmission reliability of an MIB, and a PBCH for carrying multiple times of
   transmission of the MIB may be referred to as an enhanced PBCH. Similarly, control information
   may be transmitted multiple times to improve transmission reliability of the control information,
                                                    37

   and a PDCCH for carrying multiple times of transmission of the control information may be
   referred to as an enhanced PDCCH. Data may be transmitted multiple times to improve
   transmission reliability of the data, and a PDSCH for carrying multiple times of transmission of the
   data is referred to as an enhanced PDSCH. The data herein includes, but is not limited to, an SIB 1,
 5 SI, another SIB, unicast data, a paging message, a random access response, or other common data.
   In this case, UE that requires coverage enhancement does not know a CSI-RS configuration and a
   CSI-RS subframe configuration that are configured by the base station for Normal UE or Legacy
   UE, where the Normal UE band the Legacy UE both are referred to as normal UE. When the
   enhanced transmission of the first information is performed, where the first information may be an
 0 MIB, control information, or data, if the enhanced transmission of the first information is not
   limited, CSI-RS transmission may collide with the enhanced transmission of the first information,
   lowering transmission reliability of the first information.
   [0165]      This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method,
   which can avoid a collision between CSI-RS transmission and enhanced transmission of first
 5 information, improving transmission reliability of the first information.
   [0166]      First, the base station determines the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information.
   [0167]       Specifically, a method of how the base station determines the subframe for the enhanced
   transmission of the first information is described in detail in the following embodiments, and details
 0 are not described herein.
   [0168]       S102: The base station repeatedly transmits the first information multiple times in the
   determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information, and skips channel state
   information-reference signal CSI-RS transmission on a resource element occupied by the enhanced
   transmission of the first information.
25 [0169]      The first information is a master information block MIB, and a quantity of times of
   repeatedly transmitting the MIB in at least one radio frame is greater than one time; or the first
   information is a system information block type 1 SIB 1, and a quantity of times of repeatedly
   transmitting the SIB 1 in at least two consecutive radio frames is greater than one time; or the first
   information is other system information except an MIB and an SIB 1, unicast data, a paging
30 message, a random access response RAR, a random access contention resolution message, or
   control information, and a quantity of times of repeatedly transmitting the first information in the
   determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is at least two times.
   [0170]      After determining the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information,
   the base station repeatedly transmits the first information multiple times in the determined subframe
                                                       38

   for the enhanced        transmission of the first information,        and skips the channel       state
   information-reference signal CSI-RS transmission on the resource element occupied by the
   enhanced transmission of the first information.
   [0171]       It should be noted that, according to different types of the first information, the base
 5 station repeatedly transmits the first information multiple times in the determined subframe for the
   enhanced transmission of the first information at different frequencies. When the first information is
   a master information block MIB, a quantity of times of repeatedly sending the MIB in at least one
   radio frame is greater than one time; or when the first information is a system information block
   type 1 SIB 1, a quantity of times of repeatedly sending the SIB 1 in at least two consecutive radio
 0 frames is greater than one time; or when the first information is system information, unicast data, a
   paging message, a random access response RAR, a random access contention resolution message,
   or control information except an MIB and an SIB 1, a quantity of times of repeatedly sending the
   first information in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information
   is at least two times.
 5 [0172]       According to the information transmission method provided in this embodiment of the
   present invention, a subframe for enhanced transmission of first information is determined, and the
   first information is repeatedly transmitted multiple times in the determined subframe for the
   enhanced transmission of the first information, and CSI-RS transmission is skipped on a resource
   element occupied by the enhanced transmission of the first information, where the first information
 0 is a master information block MIB, and a quantity of times of repeatedly transmitting the MIB in at
   least one radio frame is greater than one time; or the first information is a system information block
   type 1 SIB 1, and a quantity of times of repeatedly transmitting the SIB 1 in at least two consecutive
   radio frames is greater than one time; or the first information is other system information except an
   MIB and an SIB 1, unicast data, a paging message, a random access response RAR, a random
25 access contention resolution message, or control information, and a quantity of times of repeatedly
   transmitting the first information in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the
   first information is at least two times. According to the solution, a collision between the CSI-RS
   transmission and the enhanced transmission of the first information can be avoided, improving
   transmission reliability of the first information.
30                                              Embodiment 2
   [0173]       This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method.
   As shown in FIG. 2, the method includes:
   [0174]       S201: A base station determines a subframe for enhanced transmission of first
                                                      39

   information, where for an FDD (Frequency Division Duplex, frequency division duplex) system,
   the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information includes one or more subframes
   of a subframe 0, a subframe 4, a subframe 5, and a subframe 9; and for a TDD (Time Division
   Duplex, time division duplex) system, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
 5 information includes one or more subframes of the subframe 0, a subframe 1, the subframe 5, and a
   subframe 6.
   [0175]      This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method,
   which can avoid a collision between a subframe for CSI-RS transmission and a subframe for
   enhanced transmission, improving transmission reliability of first information.
 0 [0176]      First, the base station determines the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information.
   [0177]      CSI-RS transmission cannot be performed in a paging subframe determined in a cell
   specific paging configuration and a special subframe of the TDD. Similarly, if the CSI-RS
   transmission collides with transmission of a PBCH, a synchronization channel, or an SIB 1, the
 5 CSI-RS transmission cannot be performed in subframes                 for transmitting the PBCH, the
   synchronization channel, or the SIB 1, either. Therefore, the base station may choose to determine
   the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information from the foregoing subframes,
   so as to avoid a collision between the CSI-RS transmission and the enhanced transmission of the
   first information, improving transmission reliability of the first information.
 0 [0178]      In an existing LTE or LTE-A system, time-domain resources are divided as radio frames,
   and the radio frames are numbered 0 to 1023. One radio frame includes 10 subframes, a time length
   of one subframe is 1 ms, and subframes in each radio frame are numbered 0 to 9.
   [0179]      It should be noted that, for the FDD and TDD systems, a PBCH is transmitted in a
   subframe 0, and an SIB 1 is transmitted in a subframe 5 in an even-numbered radio frame. For the
25 TDD system, a subframe 1 is surely a special subframe, and a subframe 6 may be a special
   subframe.
   [0180]      It should be noted that, for a paging message, nB is used for determining a period of a
   radio frame including a paging subframe, and/or a quantity of paging subframes included in one
   radio frame. A value of nB is 4T, 2T, T, T/2, T/4, T/8, T/16, or T/32. T herein is a discontinuous
30 receiving period of user equipment. When nB is greater than or equal to T, each radio frame has a
   paging subframe and each radio frame has nB/T paging subframes. When nB is less than T, one
   radio frame in every (T/nB) radio frames has a paging subframe, and the radio frame including a
   paging subframe has only one paging subframe.
   [0181]      Exemplarily, when nB=4T, each radio frame includes four paging subframes; or
                                                      40

               when nB=T/4, one radio frame in every four radio frames has a paging subframe, and
   the radio frame including a paging subframe has only one paging subframe.
   [0182]      For the FDD system, if one radio frame includes one paging subframe, the subframe 9 is
   a paging subframe; if one radio frame includes two paging subframes, the subframe 4 and the
 5 subframe 9 are paging subframes; or if one radio frame includes four paging subframes, the
   subframe 0, the subframe 4, the subframe 5, and the subframe 9 are paging subframes; and
               for the TDD system, if one radio frame includes one paging subframe, the subframe 0 is
   a paging subframe; if one radio frame includes two paging subframes, the subframe 0 and the
   subframe 5 are paging subframes; or if one radio frame includes four paging subframes, the
 0 subframe 0, the subframe 1, the subframe 5, and the subframe 6 are paging subframes.
   [0183]      Therefore,   this embodiment    of the present disclosure provides an information
   transmission method, where the determining a subframe for enhanced transmission of first
   information may be:
               for the FDD system, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information
 5 includes one or more subframes of the subframe 0, the subframe 4, the subframe 5, and the
   subframe 9; and
               for the TDD system, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information
   includes one or more subframes of the subframe 0, the subframe 1, the subframe 5, and the
   subframe 6.
 0 [0184]      For the FDD system,
               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information includes the
   subframe 9; or
               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information includes the
   subframe 4 and the subframe 9; and
25             for the TDD system,
               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information includes the
   subframe 0; or
               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information includes the
   subframe 0 and the subframe 5.
30 [0185]      It should be additionally noted that, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the
   first information further includes:
               for the FDD system, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information
   further includes the subframe 0 and/or the subframe 5; and
               for the TDD system, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information
                                                     41

   further includes the subframe 1 and/or the subframe 6.
   [0186]       For the FDD system, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information
   includes the subframe 0, the subframe 4, the subframe 5, and the subframe 9; and
                for the TDD system, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information
 5 includes the subframe 0, the subframe 1, the subframe 5, and the subframe 6.
   [0187]       S202: The base station repeatedly transmits the first information multiple times in the
   determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information, and skips channel state
   information-reference signal CSI-RS transmission on a resource element occupied by the enhanced
   transmission of the first information.
 0 [0188]       The first information is a master information block MIB, and a quantity of times of
   repeatedly transmitting the MIB in at least one radio frame is greater than one time; or the first
   information is a system information block type 1 SIB 1, and a quantity of times of repeatedly
   transmitting the SIB 1 in at least two consecutive radio frames is greater than one time; or the first
   information is other system information except an MIB and an SIB 1, unicast data, a paging
 5 message, a random access response RAR, a random access contention resolution message, or
   control information, and a quantity of times of repeatedly transmitting the first information in the
   determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is at least two times.
   [0189]       After determining the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information,
   the base station repeatedly transmits the first information multiple times in the determined subframe
 0 for the enhanced        transmission of the first information,        and skips the channel       state
   information-reference signal CSI-RS transmission on the resource element occupied by the
   enhanced transmission of the first information.
   [0190]       It should be noted that, according to different types of the first information, the base
   station repeatedly transmits the first information multiple times in the determined subframe for the
25 enhanced transmission of the first information at different frequencies. When the first information is
   a master information block MIB, a quantity of times of repeatedly sending the MIB in at least one
   radio frame is greater than one time; or when the first information is a system information block
   type 1 SIB 1, a quantity of times of repeatedly sending the SIB 1 in at least two consecutive radio
   frames is greater than one time; or when the first information is system information, unicast data, a
30 paging message, a random access response RAR, a random access contention resolution message,
   or control information except an MIB and an SIB 1, a quantity of times of repeatedly sending the
   first information in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information
   is at least two times.
   [0191]       According to the information transmission method provided in this embodiment of the
                                                       42

   present disclosure, a subframe for enhanced transmission of first information is determined, and the
   first information is repeatedly transmitted multiple times in the determined subframe for the
   enhanced transmission of the first information, and CSI-RS transmission is skipped on a resource
   element occupied by the enhanced transmission of the first information, where the first information
 5 is a master information block MIB, and a quantity of times of repeatedly transmitting the MIB in at
   least one radio frame is greater than one time; or the first information is a system information block
   type 1 SIB 1, and a quantity of times of repeatedly transmitting the SIB 1 in at least two consecutive
   radio frames is greater than one time; or the first information is other system information except an
   MIB and an SIB 1, unicast data, a paging message, a random access response RAR, a random
 0 access contention resolution message, or control information, and a quantity of times of repeatedly
   transmitting the first information in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the
   first information is at least two times. According to the solution, a collision between the CSI-RS
   transmission and the enhanced transmission of the first information can be avoided, improving
   transmission reliability of the first information.
 5                                              Embodiment 3
   [0192]      This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method.
   As shown in FIG. 3, the method includes:
   [0193]      S301: A base station determines a subframe for enhanced transmission of first
   information.
 0 [0194]      This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method,
   which can avoid a collision between CSI-RS transmission and enhanced transmission of first
   information, improving transmission reliability of the first information.
   [0195]      First, the base station determines the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information.
25 [0196]      S302: The base station determines a resource element occupied by CSI-RS transmission
   and a subframe for the CSI-RS transmission.
   [0197]      After the base station determines the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information, the base station needs to determine the resource element occupied by the CSI-RS
   transmission and the subframe for the CSI-RS transmission.
30 [0198]      A method of determining, by the base station, a resource element occupied by CSI-RS
   transmission is as shown in FIG. 4, and specifically includes:
   [0199]      S401: The base station determines an available CSI-RS configuration according to a
   preset rule, or the base station sets an available CSI-RS configuration and notifies user equipment
                                                      43

   of the available CSI-RS configuration by using signaling, where the available CSI-RS configuration
   includes one or more CSI-RS configurations.
   [0200]      It should be noted that, there are two methods for the base station to determine an
   available CSI-RS configuration. If a system or a standard presets an available CSI-RS configuration,
 5 the base station determines an available CSI-RS configuration according to a preset rule. If the
   system or the standard does not preset an available CSI-RS configuration, the base station
   autonomously sets an available CSI-RS configuration, and notifies the user equipment of the set
   available CSI-RS configuration by using signaling.
   [0201]      The available CSI-RS configuration includes one or more CSI-RS configurations.
 0 [0202]      S402: The base station determines, according to the available CSI-RS configuration, the
   resource element occupied by the CSI-RS transmission.
   [0203]      After determining the available CSI-RS configuration, the base station determines,
   according to the available CSI-RS configuration, the resource element occupied by the CSI-RS
   transmission.
 5 [0204]      The method described in the present disclosure of determining, by the base station, a
   resource element occupied by CSI-RS transmission is also applicable in the following embodiments,
   and is not described in the following embodiments again.
   [0205]      A method of determining, by the base station, a subframe for the CSI-RS transmission is
   as shown in FIG. 5, and specifically includes:
 0 [0206]      S501: The base station determines an available CSI-RS subframe configuration
   according to a preset rule, or the base station sets an available CSI-RS subframe configuration and
   notifies user equipment of the available CSI-RS subframe configuration by using signaling, where
   the   available  CSI-RS     subframe   configuration   includes   one  or more   CSI-RS   subframe
   configurations.
25 [0207]      It should be noted that, there are two methods for the base station to determine an
   available CSI-RS subframe configuration. If a system or a standard presets an available CSI-RS
   subframe configuration, the base station determines an available CSI-RS subframe configuration
   according to a preset rule. If the system or the standard does not preset an available CSI-RS
   subframe configuration, the base station autonomously sets an available CSI-RS subframe
30 configuration, and notifies the user equipment of the set available CSI-RS subframe configuration
   by using signaling.
   [0208]      The available CSI-RS subframe configuration includes one or more CSI-RS subframe
   configurations.
   [0209]      S502: The base station determines the subframe for the CSI-RS transmission according
                                                      44

   to the available CSI-RS subframe configuration.
   [0210]       After determining the available CSI-RS subframe configuration, the base station
   determines the subframe for the CSI-RS transmission according to the available CSI-RS subframe
   configuration.
 5 [0211]       The method described in the present disclosure of determining, by the base station, a
   subframe for the CSI-RS transmission is also applicable in the following embodiments, and is not
   described in the following embodiments again.
   [0212]       It should be noted that, the signaling mentioned in steps S401, S402, S501, and S502
   specifically includes:
 0              an MIB, a system information block SIB, Radio Resource Control RRC common
   signaling, RRC dedicated signaling, Media Access Control MAC signaling, or physical layer
   signaling.
   [0213]       S303: If the subframe for the CSI-RS transmission collides with the subframe for the
   enhanced transmission of the first information, the base station skips transmitting the first
 5 information on the resource element occupied by the CSI-RS transmission in the determined
   subframe in which the enhanced transmission of the first information collides with the CSI-RS
   transmission.
   [0214]       After the base station determines the resource element occupied by the CSI-RS
   transmission and the subframe for the CSI-RS transmission, if the CSI-RS transmission is
 0 performed in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information, that is,
   the subframe for the CSI-RS transmission collides with the subframe for the enhanced transmission
   of the first information, the base station skips performing multiple times of repeatedly transmitting
   the first information on the resource element occupied by the CSI-RS transmission in the
   determined subframe in which the enhanced transmission of the first information collides with the
25 CSI-RS transmission, thereby avoiding a collision between the CSI-RS transmission and the
   enhanced transmission of the first information.
   [0215]       S304: The base station repeatedly transmits the first information multiple times in the
   determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information, and skips the channel
   state information-reference signal CSI-RS transmission on a resource element occupied by the
30 enhanced transmission of the first information.
   [0216]       The first information is a master information block MIB, and a quantity of times of

   station repeatedly transmits the first information multiple times in the determined subframe for the
   enhanced transmission of the first information at different frequencies. When the first information is
   a master information block MIB, a quantity of times of repeatedly sending the MIB in at least one
   radio frame is greater than one time; or when the first information is a system information block
 5 type 1 SIB 1, a quantity of times of repeatedly sending the SIB 1 in at least two consecutive radio

   or control information except an MIB and an SIB 1, a quantity of times of repeatedly sending the

   present disclosure, a subframe for enhanced transmission of first information is determined, and the
   first information is repeatedly transmitted multiple times in the determined subframe for the
   enhanced transmission of the first information, and CSI-RS transmission is skipped on a resource
25 element occupied by the enhanced transmission of the first information, where the first information
   is a master information block MIB, and a quantity of times of repeatedly transmitting the MIB in at
   least one radio frame is greater than one time; or the first information is a system information block

30 [0246]       This embodiment of the present disclosure provides another information transmission
   method. As shown in FIG. 8, the method includes:
   [0247]       S801: User equipment determines a subframe for enhanced transmission of first
   information.
                                                      50

   [0248]      Coverage enhancement needs to be performed on coverage of an LTE network, so as to
   ensure that the user equipment can reliably communicate with a base station when the user
   equipment is in a basement or channel quality is poor. In an existing LTE or LTE-A system, a PBCH
   for carrying one time of transmission of an MIB, a PDCCH for scheduling one time of transmission
 5 of an SIB 1, a PDSCH for carrying one time of transmission of the SIB 1, a PDCCH for scheduling
   one time of transmission of SI, and a PDSCH for carrying one time of transmission of the SI are all
   transmitted in one subframe. In the existing LTE or LTE-A system, the user equipment may perform
   channel measurement by using a CSI-RS. The base station performs CSI-RS configuration and
   CSI-RS subframe configuration for the user equipment by using dedicated signaling, so that the
 0 user equipment learns which subframes a CSI-RS is transmitted in and also learns a configuration
   of the CSI-RS.
   [0249]      In the case of coverage enhancement, MIB information may be transmitted multiple
   times to improve transmission reliability of an MIB, and a PBCH for carrying multiple times of
   transmission of the MIB may be referred to as an enhanced PBCH. Similarly, control information
 5 may be transmitted multiple times to improve transmission reliability of the control information,
   and a PDCCH for carrying multiple times of transmission of the control information may be
   referred to as an enhanced PDCCH. Data may be transmitted multiple times to improve
   transmission reliability of the data, and a PDSCH for carrying multiple times of transmission of the
   data is referred to as an enhanced PDSCH. The data herein includes, but is not limited to, an SIB 1,
 0 SI, another SIB, unicast data, a paging message, a random access response, or other common data.
   In this case, UE that requires coverage enhancement does not know a CSI-RS configuration and a
   CSI-RS subframe configuration that are configured by the base station for Normal UE or Legacy
   UE, where the Normal UE band the Legacy UE both are referred to as normal UE. When the
   enhanced transmission of the first information is performed, where the first information may be an
25 MIB, control information, or data, if the enhanced transmission of the first information is not
   limited, CSI-RS transmission may collide with the enhanced transmission of the first information,
   lowering transmission reliability of the first information.
   [0250]      This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method,
   which can avoid a collision between CSI-RS transmission and enhanced transmission of first
30 information, improving transmission reliability of the first information.
   [0251]      First, the user equipment determines the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the
   first information.
   [0252]       Specifically, a method of how the user equipment determines the subframe for the
   enhanced transmission of the first information is described in detail in the following embodiments,
                                                       51

   and details are not described herein.
   [0253]      S802: The user equipment receives, in the determined subframe for the enhanced
   transmission of the first information, the first information that is repeatedly transmitted multiple
   times, and skips CSI-RS transmission on a resource element occupied by the received first
 5 information that is repeatedly transmitted multiple times.
   [0254]      The first information is an MIB, and a quantity of times of receiving the repeatedly
   transmitted MIB in at least one radio frame is greater than one time; or the first information is an
   SIB 1, and a quantity of times of receiving the repeatedly transmitted SIB 1 in at least two
   consecutive radio frames is greater than one time; or the first information is other system
 0 information except an MIB and an SIB 1, unicast data, a paging message, a random access response
   RAR, a random access contention resolution message, or control information, and a quantity of
   times of receiving the repeatedly transmitted first information in the determined subframe for the
   enhanced transmission of the first information is at least two times.
   [0255]      After determining the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information,
 5 the user equipment receives, in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information, the first information that is repeatedly transmitted multiple times, and skips the
   CSI-RS transmission on the resource element occupied by the received first information.
   [0256]      It should be noted that, according to different types of the first information, the user
   equipment receives, at different frequencies in the determined subframe for the enhanced
 0 transmission of the first information, the first information that is repeatedly transmitted multiple
   times. When the first information is an MIB, a quantity of times of repeated receiving of the MIB in
   at least one radio frame is greater than one time; or when the first information is an SIB 1, a
   quantity of times of repeated receiving of the SIB 1 in at least two consecutive radio frames is
   greater than one time; or when the first information is other system information except an MIB and
25 an SIB 1, unicast data, a paging message, a random access response RAR, a random access
   contention resolution message, or control information, a quantity of times of repeated receiving of
   the first information in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information is at least two times.
   [0257]      It should be noted that, according to the information transmission method provided in
30 this embodiment of the present disclosure, after the user equipment receives, in the determined
   subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information, the first information that is
   repeatedly transmitted multiple times, the user equipment can further combine the received first
   information that is repeatedly transmitted multiple times, and detect the combined first information.
   [0258]      According to the information transmission method provided in this embodiment of the
                                                     52

   present disclosure, a subframe for enhanced transmission of first information is determined, and the
   first information repeatedly transmitted multiple times is received in the determined subframe for
   the enhanced transmission of the first information, and CSI-RS transmission is skipped on a
   resource element occupied by the first information that is repeatedly transmitted multiple times,
 5 where the first information is an MIB, and a quantity of times of receiving the repeatedly
   transmitted MIB in at least one radio frame is greater than one time; or the first information is an
   SIB 1, and a quantity of times of receiving the repeatedly transmitted SIB 1 in at least two
   consecutive radio frames is greater than one time; or the first information is other system
   information except an MIB and an SIB 1, unicast data, a paging message, a random access response
 0 RAR, a random access contention resolution message, or control information, and a quantity of
   times of receiving the repeatedly transmitted first information in the determined subframe for the
   enhanced transmission of the first information is at least two times. According to the solution, a
   collision between the CSI-RS transmission and the enhanced transmission of the first information
   can be avoided, improving transmission reliability of the first information.
 5                                            Embodiment 7
   [0259]      This embodiment of the present disclosure provides another information transmission
   method. As shown in FIG. 9, the method includes:
   [0260]      S901: User equipment determines a subframe for enhanced transmission of first
   information, where for an FDD system, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
 0 information includes one or more subframes of a subframe 0, a subframe 4, a subframe 5, and a
   subframe 9; and for a TDD system, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information includes one or more subframes of the subframe 0, a subframe 1, the subframe 5, and a
   subframe 6.
   [0261]      This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method,
25 which can avoid a collision between a subframe for CSI-RS transmission and a subframe for
   enhanced transmission, improving transmission reliability of first information.
   [0262]      First, the user equipment determines the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the
   first information.
   [0263]      CSI-RS transmission cannot be performed in a paging subframe determined in a cell
30 specific paging configuration and a special subframe of the TDD. Similarly, if the CSI-RS
   transmission collides with transmission of a PBCH, a synchronization channel, or an SIB 1, the
   CSI-RS transmission cannot be performed in subframes for transmitting the PBCH, the
   synchronization channel, or the SIB 1, either. Therefore, the user equipment may choose to
                                                    53

   determine the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information from the foregoing
   subframes, so as to avoid a collision between the CSI-RS transmission and the enhanced
   transmission of the first information, improving transmission reliability of the first information.
   [0264]      In an existing LTE or LTE-A system, time-domain resources are divided as radio frames,
 5 and the radio frames are numbered 0 to 1023. One radio frame includes 10 subframes, a time length
   of one subframe is 1 ms, and subframes in each radio frame are numbered 0 to 9.
   [0265]      It should be noted that, for the FDD and TDD systems, a PBCH is transmitted in a
   subframe 0, and an SIB 1 is transmitted in a subframe 5 in an even-numbered radio frame; and for
   the TDD system, a subframe 1 is surely a special subframe, and a subframe 6 may be a special
 0 subframe.
   [0266]      It should be noted that, for a paging message, nB is used for determining a period of a
   radio frame including a paging subframe, and/or a quantity of paging subframes included in one
   radio frame. A value of nB is 4T, 2T, T, T/2, T/4, T/8, T/16, or T/32. T herein is a discontinuous
   receiving period of the user equipment. When nB is greater than or equal to T, each radio frame has
 5 a paging subframe and each radio frame has nB/T paging subframes. When nB is less than T, one
   radio frame in every (T/nB) radio frames has a paging subframe, and the radio frame including a
   paging subframe has only one paging subframe.
   [0267]      Exemplarily, when nB=4T, each radio frame includes four paging subframes; or
               when nB=T/4, one radio frame in every four radio frames has a paging subframe, and
 0 the radio frame including a paging subframe has only one paging subframe.
   [0268]      For the FDD system, if one radio frame includes one paging subframe, the subframe 9 is
   a paging subframe; if one radio frame includes two paging subframes, the subframe 4 and the
   subframe 9 are paging subframes; or if one radio frame includes four paging subframes, the
   subframe 0, the subframe 4, the subframe 5, and the subframe 9 are paging subframes; and
25             for the TDD system, if one radio frame includes one paging subframe, the subframe 0 is
   a paging subframe; if one radio frame includes two paging subframes, the subframe 0 and the
   subframe 5 are paging subframes; or if one radio frame includes four paging subframes, the
   subframe 0, the subframe 1, the subframe 5, and the subframe 6 are paging subframes.
   [0269]      Therefore, this embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information
30 transmission method, where the determining a subframe for enhanced transmission of first
   information may be:
               for the FDD system, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information
   includes one or more subframes of the subframe 0, the subframe 4, the subframe 5, and the
   subframe 9; and
                                                     54

               for the TDD system, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information
   includes one or more subframes of the subframe 0, the subframe 1, the subframe 5, and the
   subframe 6.
   [0270]      For the FDD system,
 5             the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information includes the
   subframe 9; or
               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information includes the
   subframe 4 and the subframe 9; and
               for the TDD system,

   [0386]      This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method.
   As shown in FIG. 20, the method includes:
   [0387]      S1501: A base station determines a subframe for enhanced transmission of first
 5 information, where the first information is a master information block, or the first information is an
   SIB including a TDD configuration, or the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN
   subframe configuration.
   [0388]      In the prior art, in the case of coverage enhancement, UE that requires coverage
   enhancement cannot learn a TDD configuration and an MBSFN subframe configuration before
 0 receiving an SIB 1 and an SIB 2. Therefore, when enhanced transmission is performed on first
   information, a subframe used in the enhanced transmission cannot be determined, thereby lowering
   transmission reliability of the first information. This embodiment of the present disclosure provides
   an information transmission method, which can determine a subframe used in enhanced
   transmission of first information, improving transmission reliability of the first information.
 5 [0389]      First, the base station determines the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information.
   [0390]      The first information is a master information block, or the first information is an SIB
   including a TDD configuration, or the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN subframe
   configuration.
 0 [0391]      It should be noted that, the SIB including the TDD configuration is not limited to only
   the SIB 1, and may also be another SIB x including the TDD configuration; similarly, the SIB
   including the MBSFN subframe configuration is not limited to only the SIB 2, either, and may also
   be another SIB y including the TDD configuration, where x and y both are positive integers.
   Generally, a value of x of the SIB x including the TDD configuration is not equal to a value of y of
25 the SIB y including the MBSFN subframe configuration, but particularly, the value of x may also be
   equal to the value of y, which is not limited in the present disclosure.
   [0392]      It should be further noted that, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information includes any one of or a combination of the following, and there are at least one
   subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information:
30             the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is a subframe in an
   enhanced transmission opportunity of the first information or a subframe in an enhanced
   transmission bundle of the first information;
               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is a subframe in at
   least one radio frame; and
                                                       76

               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is a subframe in at
   least one system information window.
   [0393]      Particularly, for an FDD system or a Half FDD system, the subframe for the enhanced
   transmission of the first information includes one or more of a subframe 0, a subframe 4, a
 5 subframe 5, and a subframe 9; and
               for a TDD system, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information
   includes the subframe 0 and/or the subframe 5.
   [0394]      Further, for the TDD system, if the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN
   subframe configuration and a subframe 6 is not a special subframe, the subframe for the enhanced
 0 transmission of the first information further includes the subframe 6.
   [0395]      The subframe 0 is a subframe 0 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
   subframe 0 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
   subframe 0 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame;
               the subframe 4 is a subframe 4 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
 5 subframe 4 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
   subframe 4 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame;
               the subframe 5 is a subframe 5 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
   subframe 5 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
   subframe 5 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame;
 0             the subframe 6 is a subframe 6 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
   subframe 6 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
   subframe 6 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame; and
               the subframe 9 is a subframe 9 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
   subframe 9 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
25 subframe 9 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame.
   [0396]      S1502: The base station performs the enhanced transmission of the first information in
   the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information.
   [0397]      After determining the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information,
   the base station performs the enhanced transmission of the first information in the determined
30 subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information.
   [0398]      It should be noted that, when the base station performs the enhanced transmission of the
   first information in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information,
   according to different types of the first information, specific manners of transmitting the first
   information are different. If the first information is a master information block, the base station
                                                      77

   performs the enhanced transmission of the master information block in at least one radio frame a
   quantity of times that is greater than one time; if the first information is an SIB including a TDD
   configuration, the base station performs the enhanced transmission of the SIB in at least two
   consecutive radio frames a quantity of times that is greater than one time; or if the first information
 5 is an SIB including an MBSFN subframe configuration, the base station performs the enhanced
   transmission of the SIB in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information a quantity of times that is at least two times.
   [0399]       It should be additionally noted that, for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information provided in this embodiment of the present disclosure, the mentioned quantity of times
 0 of the enhanced transmission includes initial transmission of the first information. For example, the
   enhanced transmission being 1 indicates that the first information is transmitted only one time, that
   is, there is no additional repeatedly transmitting the first information; and the enhanced
   transmission being 2 indicates that the first information is transmitted two times, that is, there is
   additional one time of repeatedly transmitting the first information.
 5 [0400]       This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method,
   where a subframe for enhanced transmission of first information is determined, where the first
   information is a master information block, or the first information is an SIB including a TDD
   configuration, or the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN subframe configuration, and
   the enhanced transmission of the first information is performed in the determined subframe for the
 0 enhanced transmission of the first information. According to the solution, the subframe used in the
   enhanced transmission of the first information can be determined, improving transmission
   reliability of the first information.
                                                Embodiment 17
   [0401]       This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method.
25 As shown in FIG. 21, the method includes:
   [0402]       S1601: A base station determines a subframe for enhanced transmission of first
   information, where the first information is a master information block, or the first information is an
   SIB including a TDD configuration, or the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN
   subframe configuration.
30 [0403]       This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method,
   which can determine a subframe used in enhanced transmission of first information, improving
   transmission reliability of the first information.
   [0404]       First, the base station determines the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
                                                       78

   information. The first information is a master information block, or the first information is an SIB
   including a TDD configuration, or the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN subframe
   configuration.
   [0405]      It should be noted that, the SIB including the TDD configuration is not limited to only
 5 the SIB 1, and may also be another SIB x including the TDD configuration; similarly, the SIB
   including the MBSFN subframe configuration is not limited to only the SIB 2, either, and may also
   be another SIB y including the TDD configuration, where x and y both are positive integers.
   Generally, a value of x of the SIB x including the TDD configuration is not equal to a value of y of
   the SIB y including the MBSFN subframe configuration, but particularly, the value of x may also be
 0 equal to the value of y, which is not limited in the present disclosure.
   [0406]      It should be further noted that, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information includes any one of or a combination of the following:
               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is a subframe in an
   enhanced transmission opportunity of the first information or a subframe in an enhanced
 5 transmission bundle of the first information;
               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is a subframe in at
   least one radio frame; and
               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is a subframe in at
   least one system information window.
 0 [0407]      Particularly, for an FDD system or a Half FDD system, the subframe for the enhanced
   transmission of the first information includes one or more of a subframe 0, a subframe 4, a
   subframe 5, and a subframe 9; and
               for a TDD system, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information
   includes the subframe 0 and/or the subframe 5.
25 [0408]      Further, for the TDD system, if the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN
   subframe configuration and a subframe 6 is not a special subframe, the subframe for the enhanced
   transmission of the first information further includes the subframe 6.
   [0409]      In an existing LTE or LTE-A system, time-domain resources are divided as radio frames,
   and the radio frames are numbered 0 to 1023. One radio frame includes 10 subframes, a time length
30 of one subframe is 1 ms, and subframes in each radio frame are numbered 0 to 9.
   [0410]      For the FDD system or the Half FDD system, it can be determined that the subframe 0,
   the subframe 4, the subframe 5, and the subframe 9 are surely not MBSFN subframes; therefore, the
   subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is surely one or more of the
   subframe 0, the subframe 4, the subframe 5, and the subframe 9. For the TDD system, the subframe
                                                       79

   0, the subframe 1, the subframe 5, and the subframe 6 are surely not MBSFN subframes, but the
   subframe 1 is surely a special subframe and the subframe 6 may be a special subframe; therefore,
   the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is surely the subframe 0 and/or
   the subframe 5 and may further include the subframe 6.
 5 [0411]      Exemplarily, for the TDD system, if the subframe 0, the subframe 1, a subframe 2, and
   the subframe 6 are subframes in uplink and downlink configurations of the TDD system, the
   subframe 6 is also a special subframe. Therefore, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the
   first information can only be the subframe 0 and/or the subframe 5. If a subframe 3, the subframe 4,
   and the subframe 5 are subframes in uplink and downlink configurations of the TDD system, and
 0 the subframe 6 is a subframe in only the downlink configuration of the TDD system, the subframe 6
   is not a special subframe. Therefore, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information may be one or more of the subframe 0, the subframe 5, and the subframe 6.
   [0412]      The subframe 0 is a subframe 0 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
   subframe 0 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
 5 subframe 0 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame;
               the subframe 4 is a subframe 4 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
   subframe 4 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
   subframe 4 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame;
               the subframe 5 is a subframe 5 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
 0 subframe 5 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
   subframe 5 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame;
               the subframe 6 is a subframe 6 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
   subframe 6 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
   subframe 6 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame; and
25             the subframe 9 is a subframe 9 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
   subframe 9 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
   subframe 9 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame.
   [0413]      S1602: The base station determines a redundancy version RV, in a (repindex+1)th
   time of enhanced transmission, of the first information.
30 [0414]       RV index = ceil( 3 2 * {rep-index mod 4}) mod 4 , ceil(x) is a round-up function,
    repindex is a number of a quantity of times of the enhanced transmission of the first information,
   and mod is a modulo operation; or the RV is determined in an order of 0, 2, 3, and 1 according to
   an index of a quantity of times of the enhanced transmission.
                                                     80

   [0415]       After the base station determines the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information, a redundancy version RV of the first information during the enhanced transmission of
   the first information varies according to a quantity of times of the enhanced transmission of the first
   information, so that a format stipulated by the redundancy version RV is used for the first
 5 information, and the enhanced transmission of the first information is performed in the determined
   subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information.
   [0416]       S1603: The base station performs the enhanced transmission of the first information in
   the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information.
   [0417]       Specifically, step S 1603 of performing, by the base station, the enhanced transmission of
 0 the first information in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information may include steps S1603a to S1603c:
   [0418]       S1603a: If the first information is a master information block, the base station performs
   the enhanced transmission of the master information block in at least one radio frame a quantity of
   times that is greater than one time.
 5 [0419]       S1603b: If the first information is an SIB including a TDD configuration, the base
   station performs the enhanced transmission of the SIB in at least two consecutive radio frames a
   quantity of times that is greater than one time.
   [0420]       S1603c: If the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN subframe configuration,
   the base station performs the enhanced transmission of the SIB in the determined subframe for the
 0 enhanced transmission of the first information a quantity of times that is at least two times.
   [0421]       It should be noted that, to avoid a collision between the enhanced transmission of the
   first information and enhanced transmission of a paging message and/or a random access response
   message, when the enhanced transmission of the first information is scheduled based on a control
   channel, additional enhanced transmission of a paging message and/or a random access response
25 message is not performed in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information; and
                when the enhanced transmission of the first information is not scheduled based on a
   control channel, on a small-bandwidth carrier, the additional enhanced transmission of the paging
   message and/or the random access response message is not performed in the determined subframe
30 for the enhanced transmission of the first information, where the small-bandwidth carrier includes at
   least a carrier of 1.4 MHz and/or a carrier of 3 MHz.
   [0422]       It should be further noted that, according to types of the first information, a priority
   relationship exists between the enhanced transmission of the first information and enhanced
   transmission of other information:
                                                       81

                if the first information is an SIB including a TDD configuration, the enhanced
   transmission of the first information is after enhanced transmission of a master information block,
   and a preset first time offset exists between the enhanced transmission of the first information and
   the enhanced transmission of the master information block; and
 5              if the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN subframe configuration, the
   enhanced transmission of the first information is after enhanced transmission of an SIB including a
   TDD configuration, and a preset second time offset exists between the enhanced transmission of the
   first information and the enhanced transmission of the SIB including the TDD configuration, where
                the preset first time offset and the preset second time offset both are constant time offset
 0 values, and the preset first time offset may be equal to the preset second time offset, or the preset
   first time offset may be not equal to the preset second time offset, which is not limited in the present
   disclosure.
   [0423]       This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method,
   where a subframe for enhanced transmission of first information is determined, where the first
 5 information is a master information block, or the first information is a system information block
   SIB including a time division duplex TDD configuration, or the first information is an SIB
   including a multicast-broadcast single-frequency network MBSFN subframe configuration, and the
   enhanced transmission of the first information is performed in the determined subframe for the
   enhanced transmission of the first information. According to the solution, the subframe used in the
 0 enhanced transmission of the first information can be determined, improving transmission
   reliability of the first information.

   [0424]       This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method.
   As shown in FIG. 22, the method includes:
25 [0425]       S1701: User equipment determines a subframe for enhanced transmission of first
   information, where the first information is a master information block, or the first information is an
   SIB including a TDD configuration, or the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN
   subframe configuration.
   [0426]       This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method,
30 which can determine a subframe used in enhanced transmission of first information, improving
   transmission reliability of the first information.
   [0427]       First, the user equipment determines the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the
   first information.
                                                        82

   [0428]      The first information is a master information block, or the first information is an SIB
   including a TDD configuration, or the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN subframe
   configuration.
   [0429]      It should be noted that, the SIB including the TDD configuration is not limited to only
 5 the SIB 1, and may also be another SIB x including the TDD configuration; similarly, the SIB

   be another SIB y including the TDD configuration, where x and y both are positive integers.
   Generally, a value of x of the SIB x including the TDD configuration is not equal to a value of y of
   the SIB y including the MBSFN subframe configuration, but particularly, the value of x may also be
 0 equal to the value of y, which is not limited in the present disclosure.
   [0430]      It should be further noted that, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information includes any one of or a combination of the following, and there are at least one
   subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information:
               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is a subframe in an
 5 enhanced transmission opportunity of the first information or a subframe in an enhanced
   transmission bundle of the first information;
               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is a subframe in at
   least one radio frame; and
               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is a subframe in at
 0 least one system information window.
   [0431]      Particularly, for an FDD system or a Half FDD system, the subframe for the enhanced
   transmission of the first information includes one or more of a subframe 0, a subframe 4, a
   subframe 5, and a subframe 9; and
               for a TDD system, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information
25 includes the subframe 0 and/or the subframe 5.
   [0432]      Further, for the TDD system, if the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN
   subframe configuration and a subframe 6 is not a special subframe, the subframe for the enhanced
   transmission of the first information further includes the subframe 6.
   [0433]      The subframe 0 is a subframe 0 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
30 subframe 0 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a

   subframe 4 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
   subframe 4 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame;

               the subframe 5 is a subframe 5 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a

               the subframe 9 is a subframe 9 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a

 0 [0434]      S1702: The user equipment receives the first information in the determined subframe for
   the enhanced transmission of the first information.
   [0435]      After determining the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information,
   the user equipment receives the first information in the determined subframe for the enhanced
   transmission of the first information.
 5 [0436]      It should be noted that, when the user equipment receives the first information in the
   determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information, according to different
   types of the first information, specific manners of receiving the first information are different. If the
   first information is a master information block, the user equipment receives the master information
   block in at least one radio frame a quantity of times that is greater than one time; if the first
 0 information is an SIB including a TDD configuration, the user equipment receives the SIB in at
   least two consecutive radio frames a quantity of times that is greater than one time; or if the first
   information is an SIB including an MBSFN subframe configuration, the user equipment receives
   the SIB in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information a quantity
   of times that is at least two times.
25 [0437]      It should be additionally noted that, for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information provided in this embodiment of the present disclosure, the mentioned quantity of times
   of the enhanced transmission includes initial transmission of the first information. For example, the
   enhanced transmission being 1 indicates that the first information is transmitted only one time, that
   is, there is no additional repeatedly transmitting the first information; and the enhanced
30 transmission being 2 indicates that the first information is transmitted two times, that is, there is
   additional one time of repeatedly transmitting the first information.
   [0438]      This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method,
   where a subframe for enhanced transmission of first information is determined, where the first
   information is a master information block, or the first information is an SIB including a TDD

   the first information is received in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the
   first information. According to the solution, the subframe used in the enhanced transmission of the
   first information can be determined, improving transmission reliability of the first information.

   [0439]      This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method.
   As shown in FIG. 23, the method includes:
   [0440]       S1801: User equipment determines a subframe for enhanced transmission of first
   information, where the first information is a master information block, or the first information is an
 0 SIB including a TDD configuration, or the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN
   subframe configuration.
   [0441]      This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method,
   which can determine a subframe used in enhanced transmission of first information, improving
   transmission reliability of the first information.
 5 [0442]      First, the user equipment determines the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the
   first information. The first information is a master information block, or the first information is an
   SIB including a TDD configuration, or the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN
   subframe configuration.
   [0443]      It should be noted that, the SIB including the TDD configuration is not limited to only
 0 the SIB 1, and may also be another SIB x including the TDD configuration; similarly, the SIB
   including the MBSFN subframe configuration is not limited to only the SIB 2, either, and may also
   be another SIB y including the TDD configuration, where x and y both are positive integers.
   Generally, a value of x of the SIB x including the TDD configuration is not equal to a value of y of
   the SIB y including the MBSFN subframe configuration, but particularly, the value of x may also be
25 equal to the value of y, which is not limited in the present disclosure.
   [0444]      It should be further noted that, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information includes any one of or a combination of the following:
               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is a subframe in an
   enhanced transmission opportunity of the first information or a subframe in an enhanced
30 transmission bundle of the first information;
               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is a subframe in at
   least one radio frame; and
               the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is a subframe in at
                                                       85

   least one system information window.
   [0445]      Particularly, for an FDD system or a Half FDD system, the subframe for the enhanced
   transmission of the first information includes one or more of a subframe 0, a subframe 4, a
   subframe 5, and a subframe 9; and
 5             for a TDD system, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information
   includes the subframe 0 and/or the subframe 5.
   [0446]      Further, for the TDD system, if the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN
   subframe configuration and a subframe 6 is not a special subframe, the subframe for the enhanced
   transmission of the first information further includes the subframe 6.
 0 [0447]      In an existing LTE or LTE-A system, time-domain resources are divided as radio frames,
   and the radio frames are numbered 0 to 1023. One radio frame includes 10 subframes, a time length
   of one subframe is 1 ms, and subframes in each radio frame are numbered 0 to 9.
   [0448]      For the FDD system or the Half FDD system, it can be determined that the subframe 0,
   the subframe 4, the subframe 5, and the subframe 9 are surely not MBSFN subframes; therefore, the
 5 subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is surely one or more of the
   subframe 0, the subframe 4, the subframe 5, and the subframe 9. For the TDD system, the subframe
   0, the subframe 1, the subframe 5, and the subframe 6 are surely not MBSFN subframes, but the
   subframe 1 is surely a special subframe and the subframe 6 may be a special subframe; therefore,
   the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information is surely the subframe 0 and/or
 0 the subframe 5 and may further include the subframe 6.
   [0449]      Exemplarily, for the TDD system, if the subframe 0, the subframe 1, a subframe 2, and
   the subframe 6 are subframes in uplink and downlink configurations of the TDD system, the
   subframe 6 is also a special subframe. Therefore, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the
   first information can only be the subframe 0 and/or the subframe 5. If a subframe 3, the subframe 4,
25 and the subframe 5 are subframes in uplink and downlink configurations of the TDD system, and
   the subframe 6 is a subframe in only the downlink configuration of the TDD system, the subframe 6
   is not a special subframe. Therefore, the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first
   information may be one or more of the subframe 0, the subframe 5, and the subframe 6.
   [0450]      The subframe 0 is a subframe 0 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
30 subframe 0 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
   subframe 0 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame;
               the subframe 4 is a subframe 4 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
   subframe 4 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
   subframe 4 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame;
                                                      86

               the subframe 5 is a subframe 5 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
   subframe 5 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
   subframe 5 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame;
               the subframe 6 is a subframe 6 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
 5 subframe 6 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
   subframe 6 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame; and
               the subframe 9 is a subframe 9 in each radio frame in at least one radio frame, or a
   subframe 9 in each even-numbered radio frame in at least one even-numbered radio frame, or a
   subframe 9 in each odd-numbered radio frame in at least one odd-numbered radio frame.
 0 [0451]      S1802: The user equipment determines a redundancy version RV, in a (repindex+ 1)th
   time of enhanced transmission, of the first information.
   [0452]       RV index = ceil( 3 2 *{repindex mod 4 }) mod 4 , ceil(x) is a round-up function,
    repindex is a number of a quantity of times of the enhanced transmission of the first information,
   and mod is a modulo operation; or the RV is determined in an order of 0, 2, 3, and 1 according to
 5 an index of a quantity of times of the enhanced transmission.
   [0453]      After the user equipment determines the subframe for the enhanced transmission of the
   first information, a redundancy version RV of the first information during the enhanced
   transmission of the first information varies according to a quantity of times of the enhanced
   transmission of the first information, so that a format stipulated by the redundancy version RV is
 0 used for the first information, and the first information is received in the determined subframe for
   the enhanced transmission of the first information.
   [0454]      S1803: The user equipment receives the first information in the determined subframe for
   the enhanced transmission of the first information.
   [0455]      Specifically, step S1803 of receiving, by the user equipment, the first information in the
25 determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information may include steps
   S1803a to S1803c:
   [0456]      S1803a: If the first information is a master information block, the user equipment
   receives the master information block in at least one radio frame a quantity of times that is greater
   than one time.
30 [0457]      S1803b: If the first information is an SIB including a TDD configuration, the user
   equipment receives the SIB in at least two consecutive radio frames a quantity of times that is
   greater than one time.
   [0458]      S1803c: If the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN subframe configuration,
                                                      87

   the user equipment receives the SIB in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of
   the first information a quantity of times that is at least two times.
   [0459]       It should be noted that, to avoid a collision between the enhanced transmission of the
   first information and enhanced transmission of a paging message and/or a random access response
 5 message, when the enhanced transmission of the first information is scheduled based on a control
   channel, a paging message and/or a random access response message on which additional enhanced
   transmission is performed is not received in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission
   of the first information; and
                when the enhanced transmission of the first information is not scheduled based on a
 0 control channel, on a small-bandwidth carrier, the paging message and/or the random access
   response message on which the additional enhanced transmission is performed is not received in the
   determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the first information, where the
   small-bandwidth carrier includes at least a carrier of 1.4 MHz and/or a carrier of 3 MHz.
   [0460]       It should be further noted that, according to types of the first information, a priority
 5 relationship exists between the enhanced transmission of the first information and enhanced
   transmission of other information:
                if the first information is an SIB including a TDD configuration, the receiving of the first
   information is after receiving of a master information block, and a preset first time offset exists
   between the receiving of the first information and the receiving of the master information block;
 0 and
                if the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN subframe configuration, the
   receiving of the first information is after receiving of an SIB including a TDD configuration, and a
   preset second time offset exists between the receiving of the first information and the receiving of
   the SIB including the TDD configuration, where
25              the preset first time offset and the preset second time offset both are constant time offset
   values, and the preset first time offset may be equal to the preset second time offset, or the preset
   first time offset may be not equal to the preset second time offset, which is not limited in the present
   disclosure.
   [0461]       This embodiment of the present disclosure provides an information transmission method,
30 where a subframe for enhanced transmission of first information is determined, where the first
   information is a master information block, or the first information is an SIB including a TDD
   configuration, or the first information is an SIB including an MBSFN subframe configuration, and
   the first information is received in the determined subframe for the enhanced transmission of the
   first information. According to the solution, the subframe used in the enhanced transmission of the

   first information can be determined, improving transmission reliability of the first information.
