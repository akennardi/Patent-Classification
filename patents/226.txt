                                          ABSTRACT
        A shoe comprising an upper forming an interior portion for a foot, the interior portion
including toe and heel cavities, is provided. The shoe further comprises a midsole having toe
and heel ends and inner and outer sides. The midsole is stitched to the upper thereby forming
a bottom to the interior portion. Heel and toe outsole patches are respectively stitched onto
the midsole. An insole is affixed to the bottom of the interior portion. Heel and toe outsole
patches are respectively stitched onto the midsole. An insole is affixed to the bottom of the
interior portion. A spacing between the heel and toe outsole patches extends from the inner
to the outer side and occupies a position intermediate the toe and heel ends thereby permitting
the shoe to fold about an axis running through the spacing. The shoe folds between an
extended state, in which the shoe is wom, and a folded state in which a portion of the upper
comprising the toe cavity is tucked into the heel cavity.

                                   RELATED APPLICATION
        The present application claims priority to United States Patent Application No.
 13/207,397, filed August 10, 2011, entitled "Split-Sole Footwear".
                                 FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
        The present disclosure relates to footwear and more specifically, split-sole shoes.
                                         BACKGROUND
        Conventional footwear has structural limitations that force the wearer to make difficult
choices between style and comfort. As a result, many individuals endure significant foot pain,
or elect to wear less attractive shoes or styles that may not be appropriate for the occasion. To
address this problem, some women carry additional footwear in a car or large bag. However, a
spare pair of conventional shoes is less than ideal because of size and bulk limitations on
portability. Lightweight rollable or foldable shoes are available that offer increased
portability. However, such products do not contain the support, durability, comfort or style
desired in a non-foldable shoe.
        Moreover, prior art foldable shoes have outsoles that do not adequately protect the
shoe midsole and upper, leading to premature wear of the shoe including tearing and damage
to the shoe. Furthermore, such shoes are typically flimsy or, in other words, do not provide
adequate support or protection of the foot. For instance, many foldable shoes have an overall
spring constant that is, depending on the brand and model, between 0.14 kilogram-force / inch
and 0.34 kilogram-force / inch. Such shoes provide little or no resistance, protection and
support, and thus are inadequate to wear for repeated or extended use, particularly outside or
on rough terrain (e.g., dirty pavement, stones, etc.). Moreover, such shoes are not durable
enough to last a normal shoe lifespan even with only moderate use. Therefore, while some
footwear designs have attempted to bridge the gap between full time and portable shoes, there
remains no practical solution.
        In prior art shoe manufacturing processes, outsoles are sewn onto a midsole. These
outsoles are at the bottom of the shoe and protect the midsole and upper from wear and tear
and further provide support and rigidity to the entire shoe. After the outsoles have been sewn
on, the midsole is sewn to the upper and an insole thereby forming a single seam. This single
                                                   1

  WO 2013/022466                                                           PCT/US2011/060662
seam traverses the perimeter of the shoe and essentially delineates the shoe upper from the
midsole. While such processes are advantageous because of manufacturing efficiencies, the
drawback with such approaches is realized when one considers the properties of the outsoles.
The sewing wheel of the sewing machine used to sew the midsole, the upper, and the insole
together interferes with the outsoles previously sewn onto the midsole. As a result, a dilemma
arises. The ideal outsole patches serve to 1) protect the foot, 2) provide comfort, and 3)
provide durability by protecting the seam attaching the midsole, outsole and insole. Thus, the
ideal outsole patches are thick and wide such that the perimeter of the outsoles is close to the
seam. Yet, as the outsole becomes thicker and is brought closer to the seam that attaches the
upper, midsole and insole, the seam becomes more difficult and eventually impossible to
stitch. Thus, prior art shoes are constructed with either (i) thin and wide or (ii) narrow and
thick outsole patches. Moreover, prior art shoes are limited on their ability to add cushion
inserts below the insole because such cushion inserts make the seam even less manageable and
force more narrowing and thinning of the outsole patches leading to greater instability and/or
lower durability of the shoe and protection of the foot. Thus, in prior art shoes, shoe comfort
and durability is traded off for shoe stability. Thus the dilemma become apparent. If the
outsole is made thick and narrow, the lack of support due to the gap between the perimeter of
the outsoles and the seam becomes noticeable and uncomfortable and the seam, upper and
midsole are left exposed to the ground. If the outsole is made thin and wide, the lack of
support due to the gap between the perimeter of the outsole and the seam is not as noticeable.
However, in such instances, the upper, midsole and seam are exposed to the ground, the
outsole wears more quickly and the shoe provides limited protection and comfort.
         Given the above background, what is needed in the art are improved foldable shoe
designs and improved shoe manufacturing processes.
                                            SUMMARY
         The present disclosure addresses the preceding and other shortcomings of the prior art
by providing an improved foldable shoe. The disclosed shoes are a split-sole class of
women's shoe that allows for the shoe to be folded and placed in a drawstring pouch. The
split sole is defined by a heel outsole patch and a toe outsole patch with a spacing between the
patches. Advantageously, the disclosed shoes combine an upper and a midsole at a seam with
an insole added in separately. Thus, the insole is not concurrently stitched into the seam that
joins the midsole to the upper. This allows for (i) the perimeter of the heel outsole patch and
the toe outsole patch to be much closer to the seam joining the midsole to the upper, and (ii)
                                                  2

  WO 2013/022466                                                            PCT/US2011/060662
the outsole patches to be thicker, thereby affording better protection of the seam, midsole, and
upper, greater support and comfort to the foot, a more rigid footbed, and allows for the
insertion of thicker more substantial cushioning.
         In some embodiments, the outsole patches are sewn on. In some embodiments, the
outsole patches are both sewn and glued on. To facilitate sewing the patches on, deep grooves
near the perimeter of each outsole patch are afforded. These deep grooves are used to form
the seam between the patches and the midsole. The thread used to form this seam is better
protected by the deep grooves thereby improving the durability of the shoe and preventing
wear on the seam.
         The disclosed shoes have an improved spring constant relative to known shoes in the
women's split sole class. In some embodiments, the spring constant of the overall shoe is
between 0.40 kilogram-force / inch and 0.70 kilogram-force / inch or between 0.55 kilogram
force / inch and 0.65 kilogram-force / inch. This improved spring force constant lends greater
support and allows for prolonged periods of wear.
         In some embodiments, in addition to providing a foam inlay that is often found in
women's shoes, the disclosed shoes allow for the insertion of a cushion insert in the heel
portion of the shoes to provide additional support and comfort. Moreover, this heel portion
has greater thickness at the heel end of the shoe than at a position intermediate the heel and toe
ends of the shoes. Such a tapered thickness provides additional comfort, support, and style.
         While it is known to place an elastic restriction at the edge of the upper that receives a
woman's foot, the disclosed shoes provide an improved design by terminating the elastic
restriction in the heel portion of the shoe. There, rather than using the elastic restriction, an
embedded cushion (Achilles' cushion) is provided in order to provide greater comfort.

  WO 2013/022466                                                            PCT/US2011/060662
                                    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
         Figures 1 through 5 respectively provide perspective, side, top, front and back views of
a shoe in accordance with the disclosure. From the perspective and side views of Figures 1
and 2, and when worn, the shoe appears no different from a conventional rigid sole shoe. Yet
the shoe affords flexibility in design, foldability, and comfort without dressing down the
wearer's outfit. In some embodiments, a cushion insert absorbs impact to the foot from
walking on hard surfaces. An elastic restriction 60 runs around the top of the upper 2 to grip
the foot and form a snug fit on feet of various sizes and shapes. However, the elastic
restriction 60 is designed to not encircle the entire foot, by stopping short in the back where it
would otherwise uncomfortably grip the Achilles tendon area. Instead, an Achilles cushion 56
is embedded in the upper fold that would otherwise surround the elastic restriction 60 to
increase comfort. Moreover, in some embodiments, the Achilles heel portion of the upper 2 is
skived so as to reduce its depth. By skiving this portion of the shoe, the seam that would
normally protrude and come into contact with the foot is reduced, resulting in greater comfort.
         Elastic restriction 60 is affixed to the opening of the upper 2 so that, when worn, the
opening of the upper 2 will stretch to the size of the foot. In some embodiments, the elastic
restriction 60 is sewn and glued to the upper 2 so as to most securely affix the two materials.
In some embodiments, the elastic restriction 60 is sewn but not glued to the upper 2. By
sewing the elastic restriction without glue, the maximum amount that the elastic can be
stretched is increased. This allows for a more comfortable fit on more foot sizes. In addition,
by not gluing the elastic the natural rebound rate of the elastic restriction is preserved, adding
comfort and extending the useful life of the elastic.
         Referring to Figure 6, a flexible insole 30 provides added comfort without
compromising portability, and may be fixed or removable. Optionally, the flexible insole 30
provides arch support. The shoe further comprises a foam inlay 44 that is affixed by glue to
the insole 30. In some embodiments, a flexible arch support provides added comfort without
compromising portability. The flexible arch support does not restrict folding of the shoe, and
may be fixed or removable. In some embodiments, the midsole 8 is reinforced by affixing
flexible material on the inside of the midsole, beneath the insole 30 (e.g., between midsole 8
foam inlay 44). Reinforcement of the midsole 8 in this manner has several benefits. First, the
flex points of the footwear are strengthened without compromising portability. Second, the
portions of the midsole 8 most likely to suffer from destructive friction from contact with the
walking surface are strengthened to better withstand that stress. Third, the portion of the
midsole 8 that comes in contact with the edge of the toe outsole patch is made more resistant
                                                    5

  WO 2013/022466                                                           PCT/US2011/060662
to tearing. In some embodiments such a reinforcement is in instead of foam inlay 44. In some
embodiments such a reinforcement is in addition to foam inlay 44.
         In some embodiments, a rigid insert is inserted in between foam inlay 44 and the
midsole 8. This rigid insert extends the width of the midsole 8, and from the toe of the
midsole 8 to no further than midpoint 32 at which the footwear is folded. By inserting the
rigid insert in this manner, greater space is maintained when worn between the delicate
portions of the footwear (e.g., upper 2) and the walking surface. By increasing this space,
durability is improved.
         Continuing to refer to Figure 6, the shoe comprises three uniquely shaped elements: a
midsole 8, a heel outsole patch 24, and a toe outsole patch 26. In some embodiments, the
midsole 8 is made of a flexible but durable material, such as high quality leather. In some
embodiments, the heel outsole patch 24 and toe outsole patch 26 are constructed from all
weather, non-skid material. In typical embodiments, the heel outsole patch 24 and the toe
outsole patch 26 are individually sewn to the midsole 8. Materials required for the necessary
durability and safety of a full time shoe are too rigid to afford the necessary flexibility to be
folded. Thus, in preferred embodiments, the heel outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole patch 26
are distinct, and individually stitched to the midsole 8 with a spacing 32 between them for the
shoe to be folded. The size and shape of the heel outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole patch 26
are designed to optimally balance durability, comfort, and practicality, with compact size and
minimal weight. The shape of the heel outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole patch 26
maximize protection for the foot in a space efficient manner. In some embodiments, the
contours of the heel outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole patch 26 are sloped to provide
attractive additional height when worn, and increase the clearance between the midsole 8 and
the ground when worn. In such embodiments, the slope is designed so that when two shoes
are stacked, large meets small so as to significantly reduce the combined thickness of the
compressed pair for increased portability.
         The upper 2 of the shoe is made of a high quality flexible but durable material
designed to withstand repeated folding at the center of the shoe, as well as long periods of
storage in the folded position. Such materials reduce or eliminate cracking at the surface of
the joint, and damage from contact with surfaces. The upper 2 is constructed and stitched in a
manner to wrap around the top and sides of the foot. The specific proportion of upper to
outsole also allows the soft upper 2 to mold to wide and narrow feet, molding to the unique
shape of each wearer's foot, and adding comfort and style benefits. The proportion also
reduces the bulk of the shoes in the folded state for storage and portability. A rounded toe

  WO 2013/022466                                                           PCT/US2011/060662
cavity 6 and flexible wraparound upper design increases commercial appeal by reducing or
eliminating the need for costly half-size and/or variable width inventory, while maintaining a
durable and comfortable design. The design allows great flexibility for fashionable elements
via the upper such as distinctive colors, textures and ornamentation. When worn, the shoe
appears no different from conventional fixed sole footwear, adding style and the ability to be
worn with more formal attire.
        Referring to Figure 13, a lightweight, durable, reusable, self-contained collapsible tote
bag with handles that may be folded and compressed, and then stored in the compacting pouch
(Figure 12) adds utility to the foldable shoe system. In typical embodiments pouch is made
out of a two-way stretch material and is capable of self-folding into a shape that minimizes
volume (e.g., an approximately spherical shape). In some embodiments, the stitching of the
pouch facilitates this stretching (e.g., using a zigzag stitching). In some embodiments, a
stretch thread material is used in such stitching.
        Advantageously, the tote bag may be collapsed into a pocket of the tote bag. In some
embodiments, this pocket is in the interior of the tote bag when the tote bag is in the unfolded
state. In some embodiments the pocket is made out of an elastic material so that the tote bag is
compressed when in the folded state. When desired, the tote expands to carry an alternate pair
of shoes with sufficient volume for additional items. In some embodiments this pocket is
made out of a two-way stretch material and is capable of self-folding into a shape that
minimizes volume (e.g., an approximately spherical shape).
        Referring to Figure 12, a pouch made of stretch nylon, polyester or similar material
adds functionality by safely and cleanly storing the foldable footwear and related items. The
pouch compresses the footwear in their folded configuration for minimal size when stored or
transported. A rounded edge on the bottom of the pouch further decreases volume and
increases compression. The pouch is sized just smaller than the footwear to minimize bulk. A
drawstring around the opening of the pouch further aids compression, and seals dirty shoes
from purse or pocket contents. A pocket located on one side of the pouch allows for
compressed storage of the tote bag and/or other items.
        The disclosed foldable shoe design allows for footwear to be worn in a normal manner,
consistent with conventional rigid sole products, and suitable for various surfaces, weather,
fashions, etc. When storage or portability is desired, the shoes are folded manually at
approximately their midpoint, thus reducing their length in half. In their folded configuration,
the shoes can be stacked and placed in the compacting pouch for maximum compression and
portability. Once stowed in the pouch, the pair requires roughly the space of a wallet, and may

be carried in a purse or pocket.
         Now that an overview of the inventive shoe has been disclosed, specific features and
various embodiments of the disclosed shoes will now be described. Referring to Figure 7,
illustrated is a shoe in accordance with the present disclosure. The shoe comprises an upper 2.
The upper 2 forms an interior portion 62 for receiving a foot of a woman. The interior portion
includes a toe cavity 4 and a heel cavity 6.
         Referring to Figure 9, the shoe further comprises a midsole 8. The midsole 8 has (i) a
toe end 10, (ii) a heel end 12, (iii) an inner side 14 and (iv) an outer side 16. A perimeter of
the midsole 8 is stitched to the upper 2. The stitching of the midsole 8 to the upper 2 thereby
forms a bottom to the interior portion 62 that is bounded by a first seam 22. A heel outsole
patch 24 is stitched onto a heel portion of a first face of the midsole 8. A toe outsole patch 26
is stitched onto a toe portion of the first face of the midsole 8.
         In typical embodiments, the heel outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole patch 26 are
stitched onto the midsole before the midsole 8 has been stitched to the upper 2.
         Referring to Figure 6, there is a spacing 32 between (i) the heel outsole patch 24
stitched onto the heel portion of the first face of the midsole 8 and (ii) the toe outsole patch 26
stitched onto the toe portion of the first face of the midsole 8. The spacing 32 extends from
the inner side 14 to the outer side 16 of the midsole 8 and occupies a position intermediate the
toe end 10 and the heel end 12 of the midsole 8 thereby permitting the entire shoe to fold about
an axis 34 in the spacing 32 running between the inner side 14 and the outer side 16. In some
embodiments, the spacing is between 4/8 of an inch and 6/8 of an inch. In some embodiments,
the spacing is about 5/8 of an inch. In taking these measurements, an "average" distance
between the heel outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole patch 26 across the region bounded by
the inner side 14 and the outer side 16 may be taken. For example, at several different points
in the region bounded by the inner side 14 to the outer side 16, the distance between the edge
of the heel outsole patch 24 and the edge of the toe outsole patch 26 may be measured and
these measurements may be averaged together to determine the distance between the heel
outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole patch 26. In some embodiments the spacing is simply a
break between the heel outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole patch 26.
         Continuing to refer to Figure 6, the insole 30 is affixed by glue to the bottom of the
interior portion.
         The shoe is configured to fold between (i) an extended state wherein the heel outsole
patch 24 and the toe outsole patch 26 are coplanar or approximately coplanar (Figures 1
through 9) and (ii) a folded state in which the shoe is bent about the axis 34 such that a portion
                                                   8

  WO 2013/022466                                                           PCT/US2011/060662
of the upper 2 comprising the toe cavity 4 is tucked into the heel cavity 6 (Figure 11).
         In some embodiments, the insole 30 is not stitched to the upper 2. Thus, in such
embodiments, the first seam 22, illustrated in Figure 9, only joins the upper 2 and the midsole
8, not the insole 30. Referring to Figure 9, this affords a substantial advantage because it
allows a perimeter (edge) of the heel and toe outsole patches 24, 26 to be brought closer to the
first seam 22 than in instances where the first seam binds the upper 2, midsole 8 and the insole
30 together, and allows for thicker heel and toe outsole patches, and more substantial (thicker,
and more rigid) cushioning in the insole. This distance is illustrated as distance 104 in Figure
9A. Accordingly, in embodiments where the first seam 22 only joins the upper 2 and the
midsole 8, the edge of the back corner 64 of the toe outsole patch 26 is within 1/4 of an inch of
a portion of the first seam 22. This proximity to the seam 22, along with the thickness of the
outsole patches, advantageously serves to protect the first seam 22 as well as the region of the
midsole 8 in the spacing 32 from wear and tear. In some embodiments, an edge of front
corner 66 of the toe outsole patch 26 is within 1/4 of an inch of a portion of the first seam 22.
         In typical embodiments, the distance 104 between the edge of the toe outsole pouch 26
and the first seam 22 is uniform. In some embodiments in which this distance 104 is uniform,
(i) the edge of the back corner 64 and (ii) the edge of the front corner 66 of the toe outsole
patch 26 are respectively within 4/8 of an inch, 3/8 of an inch, or 2/8 of an inch of a
corresponding portion of the first seam 22.
         In some embodiments, an edge of the back corner 68 of the heel outsole patch 24 is
within 3/16 of an inch of a portion of the first seam 22. In some embodiments, an edge of the
front corner 70 of the heel outsole patch 24 is between 2/4 of an inch and 3/4 of an inch of a
portion of the first seam 22.  In some embodiments, the distance 104 between the edge of the
heel outsole pouch 24 and the first seam 22 is uniform. In some embodiments in which this
distance 104 is uniform, (i) the edge of the back corner 68 and (ii) the edge of the front corner
70 of the heel outsole patch 24 are respectively within 4/8 of an inch, 3/8 of an inch, or 2/8 of
an inch of a corresponding portion of the first seam 22. In some embodiments, the distance
104 between the edge of the heel outsole pouch 24 and the first seam 22 is not uniform. In
some embodiments in which this distance 104 is not uniform, the edge of the back corner 68
of the heel outsole patch 26 is within 3/8 of an inch, or 2/8 of an inch of a corresponding
portion of the first seam 22.
         Such proximate distances 104, combined with the thickness of the rubber and rigidity
of the cushioning enabled by the described method of assembly, facilitate the protection of the
midsole 8 and the upper 2, thus ensuring the durability of the shoe while at the same time

allowing for a foldable design that remains flexible and comfortable.
         Referring to Figure 9A, a unique and improved feature of the present shoes is the value
of a durability coefficient. As used herein, the term "durability coefficient" is defined as the
thickness 106 of an outsole patch divided by the distance 104 between the edge of the outsole
patch and the first seam 22. In some embodiments, the distance 104 is 4 mm and the thickness
 106 is also 4 mm and thus the durability coefficient is unity. In some embodiments, the
distance 104 is 4 mm and the thickness 106 is 5 mm and thus the durability coefficient is 1.25.
In some embodiments, the durability coefficient is between 0.8 and 1.5. In some
embodiments, the durability coefficient is between 0.9 and 1.4. In some embodiments, the
durability coefficient is between 1.0 and 1.3.
         In some embodiments, advantageously, the heel outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole
patch 26 are each at least 3/32 of an inch thick. In some embodiments, advantageously, the
heel outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole patch 26 are each at least 4/32 of an inch thick. In
some embodiments, the heel outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole patch 26 are each at least
5/32 of an inch thick. In some embodiments, the heel outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole
patch 26 are each at least 6/32 of an inch thick. In some embodiments, the heel outsole patch
24 and the toe outsole patch 26 are each at least 7/32 of an inch thick. In some embodiments,
the heel outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole patch 26 are each at least 8/32 of an inch thick.
Such thickness increases the spring constant of the soles, leading to greater support for the foot
and increased durability of the shoe. Referring to Figure 1, because of the thickness of the
outsole patches, and their proximity to the edge, it is possible to view a side of the outsole
patch at least at a 45 degree angle 100 from the horizontal 102 when the shoe is worn on a
woman's foot when the woman is standing upright with respect to the horizontal. In some
embodiments, it is possible to view a side of the outsole patch at least at a 50 degree angle, at
least a 55 degree angle, or at least a 60 degree angle 100 from the horizontal 102 when the
shoe is worn on a woman's foot when the woman is standing upright with respect to the
horizontal. This visibility of the outsole patches is described herein solely to set forth a
description of the dimensions and shapes of the disclosed shoes.
         In some embodiments, the heel outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole patch 26 are each
made out of an elastomer. Exemplary elastomers that may be used include but are not limited
to, for example, natural rubber, vulcanized natural rubber, a butadiene-styrene copolymer such
as GR-S, neoprene, nitrile rubbers, butyl, polysulfide rubbers, ethylene-propylene rubbers,
polyurethane rubbers, and silicone rubbers as described in Marks' StandardHandbookfor

  WO 2013/022466                                                            PCT/US2011/060662
 161 through 1-163, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments
the midsole 8 is made out of leather.
         Referring to Figures 6, 6A, and 6B, in some embodiments the shoe is characterized by
a midsole 8. A heel outsole patch 24 and a toe outsole patch 26 are sewn onto a first face of
the midsole 8. The midsole 8 comprises a second face having a heel portion 68 and a toe
portion 70. In some embodiments, a cushion insert 46 is glued to the heel portion 68 of a
second face of the midsole 8. The insert 46 absorbs impact to the foot when walking on hard
surfaces. The insert 46 molds to the foot over time. A foam inlay 44 is glued to (i) the
cushion insert 46 and (ii) the toe portion 70 of the second face of the midsole 8. Next an
insole 30 is affixed by glue to the foam inlay 44. The cushion insert 46 is characterized by a
first end 76 and a second end 78. The first end 76 of the cushion insert 46 is glued to a first
part 72 of the heel portion 68 and the second end 78 of the cushion insert 46 is glued to a
second part 74 of the heel portion 68. The first part 72 of the heel portion 68 is closer to the
toe portion 70 of the second face of the midsole 8 than the second part 74 of the heel portion
68. In some embodiments, the first end 76 of the cushion insert 46 has a thickness that is less
than the thickness of the second end 78 of the cushion insert 46. In some embodiments, the
cushion insert 46 has a thickness that increases along the cushion insert 46 as a function of a
distance away from the toe portion 70 of the second face of the midsole 8 so that a portion of
the cushion insert that is closest to the toe portion 70 of the midsole is thinner than a portion of
the cushion insert 46 that is farthest away from the toe portion 70 of the midsole 8. In some
embodiments, the maximum thickness of the cushion insert 46 is 3 millimeters or more, 4
millimeters or more, 5 millimeters or more, 6 millimeters or more, 7 millimeters or more, or 8
millimeters or more. This advantageously serves to improve the support provided by the shoe,
particularly at the heel, provides desired lift, and increases rigidity and thereby durability.
         In addition to providing a graduated thickness to improve foot support, the cushion
insert 46 is made out of a rigid material such as a rigid ethylene vinyl acetate or similar
cushion material. In some embodiments, the cushion insert 46 has a Shore A hardness of
between 45 and 70 or between 60 and 70. In some embodiments, the cushion insert 46 has a
density of between 0.30 g/cm 3 and 0.5 g/cm 3, between 0.40 g/cm 3 and 0.5 g/cm 3 , between 0.45
                                                               3
g/cm 3 and 0.5 g/cm 3, or between 0.50 g/cm 3 and 0.70 g/cm .
         The thickness of the heel outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole patch 26 together with
the materials used to make these patches, the proximity of these patches to the seam 22 and the
ability to add the cushion insert, contributes to a greatly improved spring constant relative to
known foldable shoes. In some embodiments, the overall spring constant of the shoe taken
                                                   11

  WO 2013/022466                                                             PCT/US2011/060662
lengthwise in the heel portion 68 of the shoe (i.e., in the region of the heel outsole patch 24) is
between 0.40 kilogram-force / inch and 0.70 kilogram-force / inch. In some embodiments, the
overall spring constant of the shoe taken lengthwise in the heel portion 68 of the shoe is
between 0.45 kilogram-force / inch and 0.65 kilogram-force / inch, or between 0.55 kilogram
force / inch and 0.65 kilogram-force / inch. In some embodiments, the overall spring constant
of the shoe taken lengthwise in the heel portion 68 of the shoe is about 0.6 kilogram-force /
inch. Referring to Figure 6, to arrive at the spring constant measurement, the portions 68 and
70 are measured separately. For each region, with the shoe held in an upright position one end
(i.e., one end of portion 68 or 70 going the long way and with shoe facing up as it would be
worn) is anchored and then the other end of the portion 68 or 70 of the shoe being measured is
forced down a set distance (e.g., 1 inch) and the force exerted by the pushed down end is then
measured.
         In some embodiments, the overall spring constant of the shoe taken lengthwise in the
toe portion 70 of the shoe (i.e., in the region of the toe outsole patch 26) is between 0.40
kilogram-force / inch and 0.70 kilogram-force / inch. In some embodiments, the overall spring
constant of the shoe taken lengthwise in the toe portion 70 of the shoe is between 0.45
kilogram-force / inch and 0.65 kilogram-force / inch or between 0.55 kilogram-force / inch
and 0.65 kilogram-force / inch. In some embodiments, the overall spring constant of the shoe
taken lengthwise in the toe portion 68 of the shoe is about 0.6 kilogram-force / inch.
         Another advantageous feature of the shoes in accordance with some embodiments of
the present disclosure are deep grooves in the heel outsole patch 24 and the toe outsole patch
26 that facilitate the stitching of the patches to the midsole 8 while at the same time protecting
the stitching. The deep grooves 48 are enabled by the advantageous design in which thick
outsole patches are employed that, at the same time, are proximate to the first seam 22 which
attaches the upper 2 to the midsole 8. The deep grooves 48 protect the stitching that attaches
the outsole patches to the midsole 9 from contact with the ground, which would cause the
stitching to wear and thereby cause the outsole patches to become detached. These
advantageous features are related. By only stitching the upper 2 to the midsole 8 to form the
first seam, rather than further stitching insole 30 to the midsole 8, it is possible to both
minimize distance 104 and increase thickness of the outsole patches 24/26 while still being
able to stitch the midsole 8 to the upper 2 using conventional processes such as a sewing
machine. Because distance 104 is minimized, it is possible to make the outsole patches 24/26
thicker (i.e., increase distance 106) without destabilizing foot support. Because the outsole
patches 24/26 are thicker, it is possible to make the first groove 48 deeper thereby better
                                                   12

  WO 2013/022466                                                              PCT/US2011/060662
protecting the stitching within the groove. Moreover, because the outsole patches are thicker,
the shoe is firm and allows for use for longer periods of time and a greater spectrum of terrain
(e.g., on asphalt, concrete, dirt roads, etc.) Referring to Figure 9, one such advantageous
embodiment has a first groove 48 having a depth of at least 3/64 of an inch that is formed
proximate to a perimeter of the heel outsole patch 24. The heel outsole patch 24 is stitched
onto the heel portion of the first face of the midsole 8 with a first thread that occupies the first
groove 48. Further, a second groove 50 having a depth of at least 3/64 of an inch is formed
proximate to a perimeter of the toe outsole patch 26. The toe outsole patch 26 is stitched onto
the toe portion of the first face of the midsole 8 with a second thread that occupies the second
groove 50. In some embodiments, the first groove 48 is about 3/32 of an inch. In some
embodiments, the second groove 50 is about 3/32 of an inch.
         Referring to Figure 5, the upper 2 is formed as a single piece having a first end and a
second end, where the first end and the second end are united by a second scam 52 at the heel
cavity. In some embodiments upper 2 is formed of two or more pieces.
         Referring to Figures 3 and 9, in typical embodiments, the upper 2 is formed as a single
piece having (i) a first end (80), (ii) a second end (82), (iii) a first edge (84) (visible in Figure
9), and (iv) a second edge (86). In some embodiments, upper 2 is formed of two or more
pieces sewn together. Referring to Figure 3, in typical embodiments, upper 2 is a single piece
having ends 1 1OA and 11B. Of course, upper 2 may be formed by any number of pieces
sewn together into a single piece having ends 1 I0A and 110B. Regardless of whether upper
originates as one or multiple pieces, ends 11OA (first end) and 110B (second end) are united
by a second seam 52 at the heel cavity 6 to complete the upper 2. Referring to Figure 9, the
first edge 84 of the upper 2 is stitched to the perimeter of the midsole 8 thereby forming the
second seam 22 and the bottom to the interior portion of the shoe. Referring back to Figure 3,
a first portion of the second edge 86 is characterized by an elastic restriction 60, where the
portion of the second edge does not extend to the heel cavity 6. In some embodiments, the
second portion of the second edge 86 is characterized by an Achilles cushion 56 that provides
an upper boundary to the heel cavity 6. Further, referring to Figure 5, in some embodiments, a
half-moon piece 58 covers a lower portion of the second seam 52 whereas a strip portion 54
covers an upper portion of the second seam 52.
         Referring to Figure 11, in some embodiments, the shoe is in a folded state. In this
folded state, the shoes can be tucked into a stretch nylon or similar material compacting pouch
(Figure 12), having a drawstring. This provides for the advantageous transport of the shoes in
a clean and compact state, while compressed into a minimal size. In some embodiments, the
                                                  13

  WO 2013/022466                                                           PCT/US2011/060662
pouch includes a pocket for holding a tote bag, where the tote bag is configured to
accommodate a pair of women's shoes, or other items and personal effects. This allows for
the possibility of carrying the shoes of the present disclosure in the pouch, while on the road,
and switching to wearing the shoes of the present disclosure by storing unwanted previously
worn shoes in the tote bag after it has been removed from the pocket of the pouch, and
expanded from its collapsed form.
        Advantageously, the shoes of the present disclosure tuck into a folded state so that they
may be stored in a compact box having a lid. Such a compact box is illustrated in Figure 10.
        In some embodiments, the edge of the outsole patches are beveled in two ways. First,
outside edge of the outsole patch is beveled at steep incline for durability and aesthetic
reasons. By preserving a steep bevel on the outside edge of the outsole patches, a greater
space is maintained between the walking surface and soft elements of the footwear, thereby
increasing durability. Second, in some embodiments the interior edge of one or more outsold
patches is beveled. By beveling the outsole patch in this manner, pressure between the edge of
the outsole patch and the softer midsole is reduced. This beveling blunts and softens the edge
of the outsole patch that is not affixed to the midsole. By softening this edge, durability and
longevity of the footwear is improved.
        As discussed above, prior art split sole footwear suffer from certain limitations. In
some embodiments, the shortcomings of the prior art are overcome by providing shoes that
achieve a maximum outsole ratio (OR), where OR is defined as:
                                                DxTxW
                                          OR =
                                                    M
        where,
                D = average depth of second groove 50,
                T =  average thickness of toe outsole patch 26,
                W = maximum width of toe outsole patch 26, and
                M  =  width of midsole 8 at point of maximum width of toe outsole patch 26,
        where W is less than M, and D, T, W and M are all given in the same unit of
        measurement (e.g., millimeters).
Accordingly, in some embodiments, the shoes of the present disclosure have an outsole ratio
OR. When this ratio is maximized, the toe outsole patch 26 is thick, the second groove 50 in
which the toe outsole patch 26 stitching is made is deep, and the toe outsole patch 26 is close
to the edge of the footwear. In some embodiments, an acceptable outsole ratio requires a toe
                                                 14

   WO 2013/022466                                                           PCT/US2011/060662
outsole patch 26 that is as narrow as possible while still able to accommodate a wide range of
foot widths. The more narrow the toe outsole patch 26, the more compact and portable the
footwear, and the better it will accommodate a narrow foot. A thicker toe outsole patch 26 is
important to foot safety and comfort when walking on uneven surfaces.
         Further, as the width of the toe outsole patch 26 is narrowed, the depth of the second
groove 50 for its stitching becomes more important because that seam area will receive more
contact with the walking surface. Thus, a deep groove 50 is necessary to protect the seam
stitching. Also increasing in importance as the width of the toe outsole patch 26 is narrowed is
the coverage of midsole 8 by the toe outsole patch 26 and its proximity to the edge of the
upper 2. The benefits of a toe outsole patch 26 that is closer to the edge of the footwear have
been presented above. Given the present disclosure, it will be appreciated that these same
principles apply to the heel outsole patch 24 and first groove 48.

         In some embodiments, a shoe is provided that achieves a maximum outsole ratio (OR),
where OR is defined as:
                                                 D' x T' x W'
                                         OR'=         M'
         where,
                  D' =  is the average depth of second groove 50 and is a value of between 2.0
         mm and 3.0 mm,
                  T' = is the average thickness of the toe outsole patch 26 and is a value of at
         least 3.0 mm,
                  W'  =  maximum width of toe outsole patch 26, and is a value of between 60 mm
         and 89 mm, and
                  M' = width of midsole 8 at point of maximum width of toe outsole patch 26,
and is a value greater than W' that is between 70 mm and 93 mm, and wherein
                  OR' is a value between 7.0 and 8.6.
In some embodiments, T' has a value of at least 4.0 mm, at least 5.0 mm, at least 6.0 mm, at
least 7.0 mm, at least 8.0 mm, or at least 9.0 mm.
         A first benefit of the shoes satisfying the OR metric is improved comfort. Thicker
outsole patches allows for more cushion between foot and walking surface and minimizes the
impact of hard objects. Wide outsole patches that are closer to the edge of the shoe covers
more of bottom of foot, preventing the foot from the uncomfortable feeling putting pressure on
the edge of the outsole or worse, hanging over the edge of the rubber.
         A second benefit is improved protection of the foot. Thicker outsoles provide more of
a barrier and thus more protection to the foot against hard or sharp objects. Further, wider
outsoles provide more protection and coverage of the foot.
         A third benefit is enhanced durability. Outsoles close to the edge of the shoe protects
the seam stitching, outsole (24, 26), midsole (8), and other delicate elements of the shoe.
Thicker outsoles (24, 26) provide more outsole to wear down before delicate parts of the shoe
(e.g., midsole 8) wear out from contact with ground. A deeper groove (e.g., first groove 48
and second groove 50) protects outsole stitching better so it doesn't wear out as quickly.
         A forth benefit is that it enables a more attractive style: the narrower shoe flexes to
adapt to wider feet when necessary. This is accomplished by a deep groove (e.g., first groove
48 and second groove 50) that protects stitching from increased contact that the groove, and
thus the stitching therein, has with ground on narrower shoe. This is further accomplished by
a thick outsole patch (e.g., heel outsole patch 24 and toe outsole patch 26) that is close to the
                                                   17

  WO 2013/022466                                                             PCT/US2011/060662
edge that becomes increasingly important on narrow shoes as some feet are wider than the
outsole. Here, the outsole thickness prevents wider feet from pushing seam / midsole 8/ upper
2 down on to ground
        A fifth benefit is that the shoe is more portable and compact because the non-foldable
heel outsole patch 24 and toe outsole patch area is minimized.
