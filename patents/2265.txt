   which is herein incorporated by reference.
                              FIELD OF THE INVENTION
            This invention relates in general to polyesters and in particular to
15 poly(trimethylene furandicarboxylate) (PTF) and articles made therefrom.
                            BACKGROUND INFORMATION
            Gas barrier properties are one of the key requirements for polymers
   used in packaging applications to protect the contents and provide desired
   shelf-life. The prevention of oxygen permeation, for example inhibits
20 oxidation and microbial growth, whereas prevention of water vapor
   permeation retains liquid content. Many polymers have emerged for these
   applications such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polyethylene (PE),
   poly(vinyl alcohol) (PvOH), ethylene vinyl alcohol polymer (EvOH),
   poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN), poly(ethylene naphthalene) (PEN), polyamide
25 derived from adipic acid and m-xylenediamine (MXD6) and poly(vinylidene
   chloride) (PVdC), and may include additives to enhance barrier properties.
   However, most of these polymers suffer from various drawbacks. For
   example, high density polyethylene (HDPE) and low density polyethylene
   (LDPE) has fair water vapor barrier, but poor oxygen barrier. EvOH
30 exhibits good oxygen barrier at low humidity levels but fails at high levels of
   humidity. PET has relatively high tensile strength but is limited by low gas
   barrier properties.
                                         -2-

           Hence, there is a need for a new polymer with improved oxygen,
   carbon dioxide, and moisture barrier properties.

   as disclosed hereinabove. In another embodiment, the polymer 302 is a
25 copolymer copolymer derived from 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid at least one
   of a diol or a polyol monomer, and at least one of a polyfunctional aromatic
   acid or a hydroxyl acid, as disclosed hereinabove. In an embodiment, the
   substrate 301 is a polymeric. Exemplary materials for the polymeric
   substrate 301 include, but are not limited to PET, HDPE, LDPE, PE, PP,
30 EvOH. In another embodiment, the substrate 301 is metallic. Exemplary
   materials for the metallic substrate 301 include, but are not limited to
   stainless steel, carbon steel, and aluminum.
           In one embodiment polymer 302 comprises of PTF or a blend of
                                        -  11 -

   PTF and Poly(alkylene furandicarboxylate) or a blend of PTF and
   Poly(alkylene terephthalate) or a copolymer comprising of PTF repeat units
   that is coated on a substrate that is typically a metal comprising of but not
   limited to aluminum, stainless steel or carbon steel to provide excellent

   cycles in TABER @ tests or preferably less than 0.005 g weight loss over
   1000 cycles or desirably less than 0.002 g weight loss over 1000 cycles.
   Such a coating may provide anti corrosion property.
             In an embodiment, the thickness of the coated polymer 302 is in the
10 range of 0.01 -2500 microns or 1-1000 microns or 2-500 microns.
             In an embodiment, the article 100, 200, 300 can be a film, a sheet, a
   coating, a shaped or molded article, or a layer in a multi-layer laminate, for
   example a shrink-wrap film. A film herein can be oriented or not oriented,
   or uniaxially oriented or biaxially oriented. In an embodiment, the article
15 100, 200, 300 in the form of a film, a sheet, a coating, a multi-layer laminate
   is characterized by an oxygen permeability rate that is at least 2-99% or
   50-98% or 75-96% lower than PET. In another embodiment, the article
   100, 200, 300 in the form of a film, a sheet, a coating, a multi-layer laminate

   vapor permeability rate that is at least 3-99% or 25-75% lower than PET.
             The difference between a sheet and a film is the thickness, but, as
   the thickness of an article will vary according to the needs of its application,
25 it is difficult to set a standard thickness that differentiates a film from a
   sheet. Nevertheless, a sheet will be defined herein as having a thickness
   greater than about 0.25 mm (10 mils). Preferably, the thickness of the
   sheets herein are from about 0.25 mm to about 25 mm, more preferably
   from about 2 mm to about 15 mm, and even more preferably from about 3
30 mm to about 10 mm. In a preferred embodiment, the sheets hereof have a
   thickness sufficient to cause the sheet to be rigid, which generally occurs at
   about 0.50 mm and greater. However, sheets thicker than 25 mm, and
   thinner than 0.25 mm may be formed. Correspondingly, films as formed
                                          - 12 -

   from the polymers hereof will in almost all cases have a thickness that is
   less than about 0.25 mm.

 5 As used herein, the term "bottle" is used interchangeably with package and
   the units "cc/bottle-day" with "cc/package-day".
           Films and sheets may be formed by any process known in the art,
   such as extrusion, compression, solution casting or injection molding. The
   parameters for each of these processes will be determined by the viscosity
10 characteristics of the polyester and the desired thickness of the article.
   Containers may also be made using blow, injection, injection stretch blow,
   extrusion blow molding in either 1-2 steps. Coextruded cast sheet with
   amorphous or crystalline PET with neat or impact modified ethylene
   copolymers may also be made.
15        A film or sheet is preferably formed by either solution casting or
   extrusion. Extrusion is particularly preferred for formation of "endless"
   products that emerge as a continuous length. For example, see Published
   P.C.T. applications WO 96/38282 and WO 97/00284, which describe the
   formation of crystallizable thermoplastic sheets by melt extrusion.
20         In extrusion, the polymeric material, whether provided as a molten
   polymer or as plastic pellets or granules, is fluidized and homogenized.
   This mixture is then forced through a suitably shaped die to produce the
   desired cross-sectional shape of the article. The extruding force may be
   exerted by a piston or ram (ram extrusion), or by a rotating screw (screw
25 extrusion), which operates within a cylinder in which the material is heated
   and plasticized and from which it is then extruded through the die in a
   continuous flow. Single screw, twin screw and multi-screw extruders may
   be used as known in the art. Different kinds of die are used to produce
   different products, such as sheets and strips (slot dies) and hollow and
30 solid sections (circular dies). In this manner, films and sheets of different
   widths and thickness may be produced. After extrusion, the polymeric film
   or sheet is taken up by rollers, cooled and taken off by means of suitable
   devices which are designed to prevent any subsequent deformation
                                        -  14 -

   thereof.
           Using extruders as known in the art, a sheet can be produced by
   extruding a layer of polymer over chilled rollers and then further drawing
   down the sheet to size greater than 0.25 mm by tension rolls. Preferably,
 5 the finished sheet is greater than 0.25 mm thick. For manufacturing large
   quantities of sheets, a sheeting calendar is employed. The rough sheet is
   fed into the gap of the calender, a machine comprising a number of
   heatable parallel cylindrical rollers which rotate in opposite directions and
   spread out the polymer and stretch it to the required thickness. The last
10 roller smooths the sheet thus produced. If the sheet is required to have a
   textured surface, the final roller is provided with an appropriate embossing
   pattern. Alternatively, the sheet may be reheated and then passed through
   an embossing calendar. The calendar is followed by one or more cooling
   drums. Finally, the finished sheet is reeled up.
15         The above extrusion process can be combined with a variety of
   post-extruding operations for expanded versatility. Such post-forming
   operations include altering round to oval shapes, stretching the sheet to
   different dimensions, machining and punching and the like.
           The polymeric film or sheet hereof may be combined with other
20 polymeric materials during extrusion and/or finishing to form laminates or
   multilayer sheets with improved characteristics, such as water vapor
   resistance. In particular, the polymeric film or sheet hereof may be
   combined with one or more of the following: polyethylene terephthalate
   (PET), aramid, polyethylene sulfide (PES), polyphenylene sulfide (PPS),
25 polyimide (PI), polyethylene imine (PEI), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN),
   polysulfone (PS), polyether ether ketone (PEEK), polyolefins, polyethylene,
   poly(cyclic olefins) and poly(cyclohexylene dimethylene terephthalate), for
   example. Other polymers which may be used in combination with the
   polyester polymer of the invention are those listed in U.S. Application Ser.
30 Nos. 09/064,826 and 09/064,720. A multilayer or laminate sheet may be
   made by any method known in the art, and may have as many as five or
   more separate layers joined together by heat, adhesive and/or a tie layer,
   as known in the art.
                                         -  15 -

           A film or sheet may also be formed by solution casting, which
   produces more consistently uniform gauge product than that made by melt
   extrusion. Solution casting comprises dissolving polymeric granules,
   powder or the like in a suitable solvent with any desired formulant, such as
 5 a plasticizer or colorant. The solution is filtered to remove dirt or large
   particles and cast from a slot die onto a moving belt, preferably of stainless
   steel, whereon the article cools. The article is then removed from the belt
   onto a windup roll. The extrudate thickness is five to fifteen times that of
   the finished article, which may then be finished in a like manner to extruded
10 product. Further, sheets and sheet-like articles, such as discs, may be
   formed by injection molding by any method known in the art; and
   containers such as bottles can be formed by blow molding.
           Regardless of how the film or sheet is formed, it may be subjected to
   biaxial orientation by stretching in either the machine and transverse
15 direction after formation by 10 times or 5 times or 2 times the original. The
   machine direction stretch is initiated in forming the article simply by rolling
   out and taking it up. This inherently stretches the film or sheet in the
   direction of takeup, orienting some of the fibers. Although this strengthens
   the article in the machine direction, it allows it to tear easily in the direction
20 at right angles to the machine direction because all of the fibers are
   oriented in one direction. Therefore, biaxially stretched articles are
   preferred for certain uses where uniform product is desired, but also where
   an improved barrier is desired. Biaxial stretching orients the fibers parallel
   to the plane of the article, but leaves the fibers randomly oriented within the
25 plane thereof. This provides superior tensile strength, flexibility, toughness,
   barrier and shrinkability, for example, in comparison to non-oriented
   articles. It is desirable to stretch the article along two axes at right angles
   to each other. This increases tensile strength and elastic modulus in the
   directions of stretch. It is most desirable for the amount of stretch in each
30 direction to be approximately equivalent, thereby providing similar
   properties or behavior within the article when tested from any direction.
           Biaxial orientation may be obtained by any process known in the art.
   However, tentering is preferred, wherein the material is stretched while
                                         -  16 -

   heating in the transverse direction simultaneously with, or subsequent to,
   stretching in the machine direction. Shrinkage can be controlled by holding
   the article in a stretched position and heating for a few seconds before
   quenching. This heat stabilizes the oriented film or sheet, which then may
 5 be forced to shrink only at temperatures above the heat stabilization
   temperature.
           The polymer 102, 202, 302 described hereinabove can be formed
   into films or sheets directly from the polymerization melt. In the alternative,
   the polyester may be formed into an easily handled shape (such as pellets)
10 from the melt, which may then be used to form a film or sheet. Sheets can
   be used, for example, for forming signs, glazings (such as in bus stop
   shelters, sky lights or recreational vehicles), displays, automobile lights and
   in thermoforming articles.
            Films obtained with polymer 102, 202, 302 as described herein show
15 excellent mechanical properties. Moreover, such films can be subject to bi
   orientation in line or after film production. The films can be also oriented
   through stretching in one direction with a stretching ratio from 1:2 up to
   1:15, more preferably from 1:2.2 up to 1:8.
            In particular, the polymer 102, 202, 302 as described herein are
20 suitable for manufacturing:
                o   mono- and bi-oriented films, and films multilayered with other

                    to such as stainless steel, carbon steel, aluminum, such
30                  coatings may include binders, agents to control flow such as
                    silica, alumina
                o   multilayer laminates with rigid or flexible backings such as for
                    example paper, plastic, aluminum, or metallic films;
                                           -  17 -

                   obtained by sintering;

                   formed using pre-expanded articles; and

                   obtained from them for use in foodstuff packaging.
            In another embodiment, the article can be a shaped or molded
   article, as shown in Figure 4, such as one or more of a container, a
   container and a lid, or a container and a closure, for example a container
10 such as a beverage container. Figure 4 schematically illustrates of a
   portion of an exemplary article 400 comprising a substrate 401 in a form of
   a housing provided with a port 405 for introducing a material, such that the
   material is in contact with the first surface 403 of the substrate 401. The
   substrate 401 comprises polymer 102, 202, 302, as disclosed herein
15 above.
            In an embodiment, the article 400 in the form of a container has an
   oxygen permeability rate that is at least 2-99% or 50-98% or 75-96% lower
   than that of PET. In another embodiment, the article 400 has a C02

            In a method of using an article hereof that is fabricated as a
   container, the container can be exposed to a heated liquid, gas or vapor,
   such as exposing the container to steam in a retort.

   comprising PTF can be used for any suitable application, including, but not
   limited to food and drug packaging, medical devices, personal care
   products, electronics and semiconductors, paints and coatings, and
   chemical Packaging.
30 Method of preparation of Polymer 102, 202, 302
           The various polymers used in an article hereof include polyesters,
   and also various copolymers (random or block), that may be made
   according to the selection of which monomers are used for polymerization.
                                         - 18 -

           The polymer can be prepared from a C2         C12 aliphatic diol and from
   2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid or a derivative thereof. In a derivative of 2,5
   furan dicarboxylic acid, the hydrogens at the 3 and/or 4 position on the
   furan ring can, if desired, be replaced, independently of each other, with
 5 CH3 , -C 2 H5 , or a C3 to C25 straight-chain, branched or cyclic alkane group,
   optionally containing one to three heteroatoms selected from the group
   consisting of 0, N, Si and S, and also optionally substituted with at least
   one member selected from the group consisting of -Cl, -Br, -F, -1,-OH,
   NH2 and -SH.       A derivative of 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid can also be
10 prepared by substitution of an ester or halide at the location of one or both
   of the acid moieties.
           A polymer for use herein can be made by a two-step process,
   wherein first a prepolymer is made having a 2,5-furandicarboxylate moiety
   within the polymer backbone. This intermediate product is preferably an
15 ester composed of two diol monomers and one diacid monomer, wherein at
   least part of the diacid monomers comprises 2,5-FDCA, followed by a melt
   polymerization of the prepolymers under suitable polymerization conditions.
   Such conditions typically involve reduced pressure to remove the excess of
   diol monomers. Esters of 2,5 furan dicarboxylic acid or the diacid itself or
20 mixtures of both may be used.
           For instance, in step (I) dimethyl-2,5-furandicarboxylate is reacted in
   a catalyzed transesterification process with about 2 equivalents of a diol, to
   generate the prepolymer while removing 2 equivalents of methanol.
   Dimethyl-2,5-furandicarboxylate is preferred, as this transesterification step
25 generates methanol, a volatile alcohol that is easy to remove. However, as
   starting material, diesters of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid with other volatile
   alcohols or phenols (e.g. having a boiling point at atmospheric pressure of
   less than 1500C, preferably less than 100C, more preferably of less than
   800C) may be used as well. Preferred examples therefore include ethanol,
30 methanol and a mixture of ethanol and methanol. The aforementioned
   reaction leads to a polyester. Moreover, the diol monomers may if desired
   contain additional hydroxyl groups, such as glycerol, pentaerythritol or
                                           - 19 -

   sugar alcohols. The furan diacid may also be used directly, or converted to
   the diester or can be added along with the diester.
           Step (II) of this process is a catalyzed polycondensation step,
   wherein the prepolymer is polycondensed under reduced pressure, at an
 5 elevated temperature and in the presence of a suitable catalyst. In various
   embodiments of this process, the first step is a transesterification step,
   catalyzed by a specific transesterification catalyst at a temperature
   preferably in the range of from about 150 to about 2600C, more preferably
   in the range of from about 180 to about 2400 C and carried out until the
10 starting ester content is reduced until it reaches the range of about 3 mol%
   to less than about 1 mol%. The transesterification catalyst may be
   removed, to avoid interaction in the second step of polycondensation, but
   typically is included in the second step. The selection of the
   transesterification catalyst is therefore effected by the selection of the
15 catalyst used in the polycondensation step. Tyzor@ organic titanates and
   zirconates catalysts such Tyzor@ TPT, Tyzor@ TBT can be used. Tin(IV)
   based catalysts, preferably organotin(IV) based catalysts such as
   alkyltin(IV) salts including monoalkyltin(IV) salts, dialkyl and trialkyltin(IV)
   salts and mixtures thereof, can also be used as transesterification
20 catalysts, that are better than tin(II) based catalysts such as tin(II) octoate.
   These tin(IV) based catalysts may be used with alternative or additional
   transesterification catalysts. Antimony based catalysts can also be used.
           Examples of alternative or additional transesterification catalysts that
   may be used in step 1 include one or more of titanium(IV) alkoxides or
25 titanium(IV) chelates, zirconium(IV) chelates, or zirconium(IV) salts (e.g.
   alkoxides); hafnium(IV) chelates or hafnium(IV) salts (e.g. alkoxides).
   Other suitable transesterification catalysts are butyltin(IV) tris(octoate),
   dibutyltin(IV) di(octoate), dibutyltin(IV) diacetate, dibutyltin(IV) laureate,
   bis(dibutylchlorotin(IV)) oxide, dibutyltin dichloride, tributyltin(IV) benzoate
30 and dibutyltin oxide, antimony oxides.
           The active catalyst as present during the reaction may be different
   from the catalyst as added to the reaction mixture. The catalysts are used
   in an amount of about 0.01 mol % relative to initial diester to about 0.2 mol
                                         -  20 -

   % relative to initial diester, more preferably in an amount of about 0.04 mol
   % of initial diester to about 0.16 mol % of initial diester.
           The intermediate product is used as such in the subsequent
   polycondensation step. In this catalyzed polycondensation step, the
 5 prepolymer is polycondensed under reduced pressure, at an elevated
   temperature and in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The temperature is
   preferably in the range of about the melting point of the polymer to about
   300C above this melting point, but preferably not less than about 1800C.
   The pressure should be reduced preferably gradually. It should preferably
10 be reduced to as low as possible, more preferably below 1 mbar.
           This second step is preferably catalyzed by a polycondensation
   catalyst such as one of those listed below, and the reaction is preferably
   carried out at mild melt conditions. Examples of suitable polycondensation
   catalysts include titanium(IV) alkoxides or titanium(IV) chelates,
15 zirconium(IV) chelates, or zirconium(IV) salts (e.g. alkoxides); hafnium(IV)
   chelates or hafnium(IV) salts (e.g. alkoxides) tin(II) salts such as tin(II)
   oxide, tin(II) dioctoate, butyltin(II) octoate, or tin(II) oxalate. Other catalysts
   include tin(II) salts obtained by the reduction of the tin(IV) catalyst, e.g.
   alkyltin(IV), dialkyltin(IV), or trialkyltin(IV) salts, antimony based salts used
20 as transesterification catalyst with a reducing compound. Additional
   catalyst can be added prior to the condensation reaction to increase
   reaction efficacy. Reducing compounds used may be well-known reducing
   compounds, preferably phosphorus compounds. Various suitable reducing
   compounds are organophosphorus compounds of trivalent phosphorus, in
25 particular a monoalkyl or dialkyl phosphinate, a phosphonite or a phosphite.
   Examples of suitable phosphorus compounds are triphenyl phosphite,
   diphenyl alkyl phosphite, phenyl dialkyl phosphite,
   tris(nonylphenyl)phosphite, trilauryl phosphite, trioctadecyl phosphite,
   distearyl pentaerythritol diphosphite, tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite,
30 diisodecyl pentaerythritol diphosphite, di(2,4-di-tert
   butylphenyl)pentaerythritol diphosphite, tristearylsorbitol triphosphite,
   tetrakis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) 4,4'-diphenylenediphosphonite, 4,4'
   isopropylidenediphenol alkyl (C12-15) phosphite, poly(dipropylene glycol)
                                           -   21 -

   phenyl phosphite, tetraphenyl dipropylene glycol phosphite, tetraphenyl
   diisopropylene glycol phosphite, trisisodecyl phosphite, diisodecyl-phenyl
   phosphite, diphenyl isodecyl phosphite, and mixtures of these.
            In various embodiments, the catalysts therefore include Ti salts such
 5 as titanium(IV) alkoxides or titanium(IV) chelates and/or zirconium salts can
   be used along with reducing agents. Preferably, the reducing compound is
   added in the melt of the prepolymer. The addition of the reducing
   compound at this stage will sometimes avoid discoloration of the polymer
   product and increase molecular weight of the polymer. It is thus found that
10 a combination of transesterification catalyst and polycondensation catalyst
   that is of particular interest is based on a tin(IV) type catalyst during
   transesterification, which is reduced, preferably with triphenylphosphite
   and/or tris(nonylphenyl)phosphite, to a tin(II) type catalyst during the
   polycondensation.
15          The catalysts are used in an amount of about 0.01 mol% relative to
   initial diester to about 0.2 mol% relative to initial diester, more preferably in
   an amount of about 0.04 mol% of initial diester, to about 0.16 mol% of initial
   diester.
            In solid state polymerization (SSP) processes pellets, granules,
20 chips or flakes of polymer are subjected for a certain amount of time to
   elevated temperatures (below melting point) in a hopper, a tumbling drier or
   a vertical tube reactor or the like. The presence of titanium based catalysts
   during SSP of the FDCA-based polymers has enabled the polymer to reach
   a number average molecular weight of 20,000 and greater. As compared
25 to SSP as typically used to upgrade recycled PET, the temperature should
   be elevated but nonetheless remain (well) below the melting point of the
   polymer.

                                   TEST METHODS
   Molecular Weight by Size Exclusion Chromatography
           A size exclusion chromatography system, Alliance       2 6 9 5 TM (Waters
20 Corporation, Milford, MA), was provided with a Waters       4 14 TM  differential
   refractive index detector, a multi-angle light scattering photometer DAWN
   Heleos II (Wyatt Technologies, Santa Barbara, CA), and a ViscoStarTM
   differential capillary viscometer detector (Wyatt). The software for data
   acquisition and reduction was Astra@ version 5.4 by Wyatt. The columns
25 used were two Shodex GPC HFIP-806M            TM styrene-divinyl benzene
   columns with an exclusion limit of 2 x 107 and 8,000/30cm theoretical
   plates; and one Shodex GPC HFIP-804M           TM styrene-divinyl benzene
   column with an exclusion limit 2 x 105 and 10,000/30cm theoretical plates.
           The specimen was dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol
30 (HFIP) containing 0.01 M sodium trifluoroacetate by mixing at 50 0C with
   moderate agitation for four hours followed by filtration through a 0.45 pm
   PTFE filter. Concentration of the solution was circa 2 mg/mL.
                                         - 24  -

           Data was taken with the chromatograph set at 350C, with a flow rate
   of 0.5 ml/min. The injection volume was 100 pl. The run time was 80 min.
   Data reduction was performed incorporating data from all three detectors
   described above. Eight scattering angles were employed with the light
 5 scattering detector. No standard for column calibration was involved in the
   data processing.
   Molecular Weight by Intrinsic Viscosity
           Intrinsic viscosity (IV) was determined using the Goodyear R-1 03B
10 Equivalent IV method, using T-3, Selar@ X250, Sorona@64 as calibration
   standards on a Viscotek@ Forced Flow Viscometer Modey Y-501 C.

 5 (IV) isopropoxide (2 g), Dovernox-10 (5.4g) were charged to a 10-lb
   stainless steel stirred autoclave (Delaware valley steel 1955, vessel #: XS
   1963) equipped with a stirring rod and condenser. A nitrogen purge was
   applied and stirring was commenced at 30 rpm to form a slurry. While
   stirring, the autoclave was subject to three cycles of pressurization to 50 psi
10 of nitrogen followed by evacuation. A weak nitrogen purge (~0.5 L/min)
   was then established to maintain an inert atmosphere. While the autoclave
   was heated to the set point of 2400C methanol evolution began at a batch
   temperature of 1850C. Methanol distillation continued for 120 minutes
   during which the batch temperature increased from 1850C to 2380C. When
15 the temperature leveled out at 2380C, a second charge of titanium (IV)
   isopropoxide (2g) was added. At this time a vacuum ramp was initiated
   that during 60 minutes reduced the pressure from 760 torr to 300 torr
   (pumping through the column) and from 300 torr to 0.05 torr (pumping
   through the trap). The mixture, when at 0.05 torr, was left under vacuum
20 and stirring for 5 hours after which nitrogen was used to pressurize the
   vessel back to 760 torr.
           The formed polymer was recovered by pushing the melt through an
   exit valve at the bottom of the vessel and into a water quench bath. The
   thus formed strand was strung through a pelletizer, equipped with an air jet
25 to dry the polymer free from moisture, cutting the polymer strand into chips
    ~1/4inch long and ~1/8 inch in diameter. Yield was approximately 2724 g
   (~5lbs). Tg was ca. 580C (DSC, 50C/min,      2 nd heat), Tm was ca. 1760C
   (DSC, 50C/min, 2 nd heat).   1H-NMR   (TCE-d) 5: 7.05 (s, 2H), 4.40 (m, 4H),

           In order to increase the molecular weight of the PTF pre-polymers
   (described in section 1a above) solid phase polymerization was conducted.
   The quenched and pelletized PTF pre-polymer was initially crystallized by
   placing the material in a vacuum oven, subsequently heating the pellets
15 under vacuum and a weak nitrogen purge to 120 0 C for 120 minutes. At
   this time the oven temperature was increased to ~163 0C and the pellets left
   under vacuum/nitrogen purge condition to build molecular weight. The
   oven was turned off and the pellets allowed to cool and analyzed with SEC
   and IV, for a summary of conditions and obtained molecular weights see

   Procedure for Film preparation for PEF and PBF
           PEF and PBF polymers prepared above were compression molded
   into 8- 10 micron thick films using a hydraulic platen press. The polymer
   pellets were placed in a 6 inch by 6 inch frame supported on Kapton film.
25 The polymer sample and the Kapton@ film was placed between two sheets
   of fiberglass reinforced Teflon@ and into press. The press was preheated
   to the desired temperature (210   OC  for PBF, PTF-A and 250  OC for PEF)
   and the film sandwich was placed between the platen. The platen was
   subjected to 20,000 psig pressure was used for a period of 5-8 minutes.
30 The film sandwich was removed and placed between two cooling plates for
   quenching purposes. The produced film was separated from the Teflon@
   sheet, and measured for thickness.

            Films produced from PTF, both amorphous (PTF-F-2.2) and
   crystallized (PTF-F-2.3) shows an unexpected decrease in gas permeation
   rates compared to other furan based polyesters such as PEF-F and PBF-F,
 5 shown in table 4. Low gas permeation rates implies that these are high gas
   barrier materials. Even the amorphous PTF film (PTF-F-2.2) shows ~ 28%
   improvement over PEF and ~ 73% improvement over PBF in oxygen
   barrier. The crystalline PTF film shows ~ 72% improvement over PEF and
    ~ 90% improvement over PBF in oxygen barrier. Similarly, the CO 2 barrier
10 for PTF is about 98% lower than PBF, depending on the crystallinity of the
   PTF film. Similarly, the water vapor barrier for PTF is about 70% lower than
   PBF, depending on the crystallinity of the PTF film. Although not
   quantified, both PEF and PBF films had substantial crystallinity, indicated
   by the opaqueness of the produced films.

   dried 500mL three necked kettle reactor fitted with an overhead stirrer and
   a distillation condenser. A nitrogen purge was applied to the flask which
25 was kept at a temperature of 23 OC. Stirring was commenced at 50 rpm to
                                        -   31 -

   form a slurry. While stirring, the flask was evacuated to 0.13 MPa and then
   repressurized with N2 , for a total of 3 cycles. After the first evacuation and
   repressurization, titanium (IV) isopropoxide (95mg) was added.
             After the 3 cycles of evacuation and repressurization, the flask was
 5 immersed into a preheated liquid metal bath set at 1600C. The contents of
   the flask were stirred for 20 min after placing it in the liquid metal bath,
   causing the solid ingredients to melt. Next, the stirring speed was
   increased to 180 rpm and the liquid metal bath setpoint was increased to
   160 C. After about 20 minutes, the bath had come up to temperature,
10 after which the metal bath setpoint was increased to 1800C. After about 20
   min, the bath had come to temperature. The flask was then held at 180'C
   still stirring at 180 rpm for an additional 45-60 minutes to distill off most of
   the methanol being formed in the reaction. Following the hold period at
   1800C, the metal bath setpoint was increased to 210)C. After about 20
15 minutes, the bath had come to temperature. The flask was then held at
   21  00C   still stirring at 180 rpm for an additional 45-60 min after which the
   nitrogen purge was discontinued, and a vacuum was gradually applied in
   increments of approximately 1330Pa every 10 s while stirring continued.
   After about 60 min the vacuum leveled out at 6500-8000 Pa. The stirring
20 speed was then kept between 50-180rpm and the metal bath set point
   increased to 2300C. After about 20 min, the bath had come to temperature
   and the conditions were maintained for ~3 hours.
             Periodically, the stirring speed was increased to 180 rpm, and then
   the stirrer was stopped. The stirrer was restarted, and the applied torque
25 about 5 seconds after startup was measured. When a torque of 75 N/cm or
   greater was observed, reaction was discontinued by halting stirring and
   removing the flask from the liquid metal bath. The overhead stirrer was
   elevated from the floor of the reaction vessel, the kettle removed, and the
   produced polymer recovered by decanting under a stream of nitrogen gas.
30 The recovered polymer was chopped into pellets using a Wiley mill that
   was cooled with liquid nitrogen. The so produced polymer pellets were
   dried under vacuum and a weak nitrogen stream at 500C for 48 hours. The
   yield was ~145g. Tg was ~ 530C, no melting point was observed. 1H-NMR

   were pressed into 0.1 5-0.20millimeter thick amorphous films using a
   heated Pasadena press (Model #: P-1250, Pasadena company). Specific
20 conditions used for each film are given in Table 5 below. Two films were
   created for each sample. As a general procedure, square polymer films
   were made from a cut mold produced from a 0.25millimeter thick Kapton®
   polyimide film. The polymer sample and the Kapton@ film was placed
   between two sheets of fiberglass reinforced Teflon@ and into the Pasadena
25 press. Each sample was preheated at 0 pressure for 8 minutes at 275 C. It
   was subject to a pressure of 5000 psig for 7 minutes. After the indicated
   time, the plates were removed from the press and the film quenched in an

           Polymer pellets from       PET (NanYa       AA72) and      PTF_4 were
   individually loaded in aluminum trays and placed in a vacuum oven. Under
   vacuum and a stream of nitrogen the samples were heated to 1200C and
   kept for 24 hours to thoroughly remove any residual moisture. The dried
25 pellets were placed and sealed in a plastic container before compounding.

           The dried PET NanYa AA72 and PTF_4 pellets were prior to melt
   compounding combined to form a batch with a concentration of 1Owt% of
   the PTF pellets based upon the total weight of the blend. The thus
   combined pellets were mixed in a plastic bag by shaking and tumbling by
 5 hand.
           The thus mixed batch was placed into a K-Tron T-20 (K-Tron
   Process Group, Pittman, NJ) weight loss feeder feeding a PRISM
   laboratory co-rotating twin screw extruder (available from Thermo Fisher
   Scientific, Inc.) equipped with a barrel having four heating zones and a
10 diameter of 16 millimeter fitted with a twin spiral P1 screw. The extruder
   was fitted with a 3/16" diameter circular cross-Section single aperture
   strand die. The nominal polymer feed rate was 5.6 lbs/hr. The first barrel
   Section was set at 180   OC  and the subsequent three barrel Sections and
   the die were set at 240  OC.  The screw speed was set at 100 rpm. The melt
15 temperature of the extrudate was determined to be 256 'C by inserting a
   thermocouple probe into the melt as it exited the die. The thus extruded
   monofilament strand was quenched in a water bath. Air knives dewatered
   the strand before it was fed to a cutter that sliced the strand into about 2
   mm length blend pellets. The produced blend pellet had an intrinsic
20 viscosity of 0.8dL/g.

      For the production of bottles 22g preforms were initially injection molded
   using conventional methods. Specifically, an Arburg 420M single screw
   injection molding machine was used. The barrel temperature settings of the
   feed/zone 2/zone 3/zone 4/nozzle were set at 230/230/230/230/2300C for
 5 PTF_4. The mold temperature was set at 120C and the cycle time was 26.5
   seconds for both polymers. Regarding pressure conditions for injection and
   hold, PTF_4 was processed with identical conditions as compared with the
   PET control. The produced bottle preforms appeared to be of good quality
   in terms of clarity and shape without any indication of flaws, specs, or
10 buildup of material around the threads or along the preform.
   C. Preparation of injection stretch blow molded bottles
      For the production of bottles the preforms prepared in section B above
   were    injection    stretch  blow   molded   using  conventional    methods.
   Specifically, a SIDEL SBO 2/3 blow molding machine was used to produce
15 12 oz. bottles. The production rate was 1000 bottles per hour and the blow
   cycle time      -2.5   seconds per bottle. The      PTF_4   preform    preblow
   temperature was ~700C. The blow condition for PTF_4 was very similar as
   compared to PET. The produced bottles appeared to be of good optical
   quality and with adequate mechanical strength. A summary of bottle side
20 wall tensile properties is given in Table 7 below.

   12 oz. PET bottles, except that instead of using PTF, PET (Laser+@

   production of preforms, the barrel temperature settings of the feed/zone
   2/zone 3/zone 4/nozzle were set at 268/268/268/268/2740C. For
30 production of blown bottles the PET preform preblow temperature was
    ~99oC. Typical PET pressure and hold conditions were used for the

          As seen from Table 8, the monolayer PTF bottle (PTF-B-SL-6)
   provides a 96% improvement in oxygen, an 97% improvement in carbon
   dioxide, and an 43% improvement in water vapor barrier properties
   compared to the PET comparative example (PET Laser+@ C9921). Please
15 note that the stretch ratio between the PTF bottle and the comparative
   example bottle was the same.

   molded multilayer bottles (PTF-B-ML-7) from PTF and PET, and

   A. Drying of polymer pellets
                                           -     38 -

       Polymer pellets from PET (Laser+@ 4000) and PTF_4 were dried
   according to Example 3 above.
   B. Preparation of multilayer injection molded bottle preforms
           For the production of multilayer 10 oz. bottles 17g multilayer
 5 preforms were made in a similar injection molding process explained in
   Example 3 above. It is well known that a barrier polymer resin is applied as
   a discrete layer in various packaging options. Typically the barrier layer is
   surrounded by a structural polymer that provides bulk and mechanical
   strength. In order to provide a multilayer preform a Kortec multilayer
10 manifold was used that through an annular feed distributes two individual
   polymer melt flows, processed from two individual single screw extruders,
   into the preform mold. Here PTF_4 was used as the middle layer at 5 and
   1Owt% relative the total preform weight, and PET was distributed to provide
   the outer and inner layers. The barrel temperature settings of the feed/zone
15 2/zone 3/zone 4 were set at 270/270/270/2700C for PET and
   210/230/230/2300C for PTF_4. The mold temperature was set at 12C and
   the cycle time was ~31 seconds for all produced preforms. Regarding
   pressure conditions for injection and hold, the multilayer preforms
   containing PTF_4 was processed with identical conditions as compared
20 with the PET comparative example. The produced multilayer preforms
   appeared to be of good quality in terms of clarity and shape without any
   indication of flaws, specs, or buildup of material around the threads or
   along the preform. Furthermore, the PTF_4 middle layer was clearly
   observed when analyzing the preform cross-section.

   C. Preparation of infection stretch blow molded multilayer bottles
       For the production of multilayer bottles the preforms prepared in section
   B above were injection stretch blow molded using conventional methods.
   Machine and conditions were similar as in Example 3 above. It is to be
30 noted that the 5 and 1Owt% PTF_4 containing preforms processed identical
   to the PET comparative example. The produced bottles appeared to be of
   good optical quality and with adequate mechanical strength.

   Comparative Example E: Preparation of preforms and 10 oz. stretch
   blow molded monolayer bottles from neat PET and resulting barrier

          A procedure similar to as described in Example 6 was used to make
10 10 oz. PET bottles, except that instead of using PTF, PET (Laser+@
   C9921) was fed in both extruders. The barrel temperature settings of the
   feed/zone 2/zone 3/zone 4 were set at 270/270/270/2700C. Typical PET
   pressure and hold conditions were used for the injection molding, and blow
   molding step.

         Example E
           As seen from Table 10, the multiayer PTF bottle (5wt%) provides an
   2.4% improvement in oxygen, an 11% improvement in carbon dioxide, and
   an 7% improvement in water vapor as compared to the PET comparative
 5 example(PET Laser+@ C9921. Although the multilayer processing was not
   optimized for improvement in gas barrier properties, improvement was
   obtained at even low levels of PTF i.e., 5wt%.
           The multiayer PTF bottle (1Owt%) provides 17% improvement in
   oxygen, 42% improvement in carbon dioxide, and 3% improvement in
10 water vapor as compared to the PET comparative example (PET Laser+@
   C9921. These results indicate that as one increases the PTF content in the
   article such as multilayer bottles, the barrier properties show further
   improvement.     Please note that the stretch ratio between the PTF bottle
   and the comparative example PET bottle was the same.

   Example 8: Preparation of cast and biaxially oriented films (PTF-F
   BiO-8) of PTF 5 and measured barrier
   A. Drying of polymer pellets
20     PTF_5 polymer pellets were dried according to Example 3 above.
   B. Preparation of cast extruded films
       For the production of cast extruded films a 28 mm W&P (Werner &
   Phleiderer) twin screw extruder was used equipped with a 60/200 mesh
                                        -   41 -

   filter screen and a 25 centimeter wide film casting die. PTF_5 pellets were
   fed similar to Example 3 above and the extruder barrel sections (5 in total)
   and die were all set at 2350C, the extruder feed temperature was set at
   1800C. The feed rate was 15 pounds per hour and the extruder screw
 5 speed was 125 rpm. The panel melt temperature was measured at 2570C.
   The film was collected after being cast on a cooling drum with a
   temperature set point of 400C, the measured film thickness was
    -0.55millimeter and the width was about 22 centimeter. Following the
   casting process the produced film was cut into paper sized films
10 (-20x30centimeter).
   C. Preparation of oriented films
            For the production of biaxially oriented films a heated Maxi Grip 750
   S device was used. Initially 140x1 40millimeter films were cut and loaded
   into the device. The film was subsequently heated and optimal orientation
15 was possible when the film temperature was in the proximity of 85-860C,
   this typically required a preheat time of -60 seconds. The stretching speed
   was 23x34%/second which resulted in a stretch ratio of 2.7x3.5, the
   obtained film thickness was -60-130micrometer.
            The oriented films were tested for their barrier properties and a
20 summary is given in Table 13 below.

   Example 9: Powder coating of metal substrates with PTF
           PTF polymer pellets were cryo-milled through four passes to
   produce a powder using a Spex mill. Analysis of the particle size
   distribution of the milled material was done using a Malvern Mastersizer
10 2000 particle analyzer in water (both with and without sonication) to give
   measured values of d(0.5) ~ 54 micron, d(0.9) ~ 145 micron and d(0.1) of
   16 micron. The milled powder was applied to a degreased aluminum and
   carbon steel panels using an electrostatic sprayer and then cured at 380   0C
   for 20 minutes in a vented convection oven. Examination of these panels
15 showed that the coating produced was clear with an average coating
   thickness of 3 microns. These coated panels showed excellent abrasion
   resistance in the TABER@ Abraser tester to provide a weight loss of 0.0017
   g loss over 1000 cycles using ASTM D3451.
