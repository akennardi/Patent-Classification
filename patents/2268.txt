                                           ABSTRACT
In some embodiments, a device displays functionality information in response to receiving an
indication of a first input for which a contact meets functionality display criteria. In some
embodiments, a device generates a user interface that includes a navigation bar including
images from different positions in a respective content item, and a representation of an
adjacent content item. In some embodiments, a device moves a selection-indicator in a user
interface by a predefined amount in response to receiving an indication of a first input that
meets unitary movement criteria. In some embodiments, a device interprets movement of a
contact of an input based at least in part on a grip of a user. In some embodiments, a device
displays a plurality of character selection options when a text entry field is not tolerant of
character ambiguity and a first input corresponds to a plurality of candidate characters.

                                     Field of the Disclosure
[0002]          This relates generally to electronic devices with which interaction is
accomplished using touch-sensitive surfaces.
                                 Background of the Disclosure
[0003]          User interaction with devices such as computers and other electronic
computing devices has increased significantly in recent years. These devices can be devices
such as computers, tablet computers, televisions, multimedia devices, and the like, and these
devices can present user interfaces to users to facilitate the above interaction.
[0004]          Interaction with the above devices can be performed using various input
devices, such as touch screen displays, touch-sensitive surfaces, remote controls, mice and
other input devices. Touch-sensitive surfaces and touch screen displays, in particular, have
become increasingly popular input devices. Providing for robust user interface-input device
interaction enhances the user's experience with the device and decreases user interaction
time, which is particularly important where input devices are battery-operated.

[0024]           In the following description of embodiments, reference is made to the
accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which it is shown by way of
illustration specific embodiments that are optionally practiced. It is to be understood that
other embodiments are optionally used and structural changes are optionally made
without departing from the scope of the disclosed embodiments.

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
[0025]           Embodiments of electronic devices, user interfaces for such devices, and
associated processes for using such devices are described. In some embodiments, the
device is a portable communications device, such as a mobile telephone, that also
contains other functions, such as PDA and/or music player functions. Exemplary
embodiments of portable multifunction devices include, without limitation, the iPhone@,
iPod Touch@, and iPad@ devices from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California. Other
portable electronic devices, such as laptops or tablet computers with touch-sensitive
surfaces (e.g., touch screen displays and/or touch pads), are, optionally, used. It should
also be understood that, in some embodiments, the device is not a portable
communications device, but is a desktop computer or a television with a touch-sensitive
surface (e.g., a touch screen display and/or a touch pad). In some embodiments, the
device does not have a touch screen display and/or a touch pad, but rather is capable of
outputting display information (such as the user interfaces of the disclosure) for display
on a separate display device, and capable of receiving input information from a separate
input device having one or more input mechanisms (such as one or more buttons, a touch
screen display and/or a touch pad). In some embodiments, the device has a display, but is
capable of receiving input information from a separate input device having one or more
input mechanisms (such as one or more buttons, a touch screen display and/or a touch
pad).
[0026]           In the discussion that follows, an electronic device that includes a display
and a touch-sensitive surface is described. It should be understood, however, that the
electronic device optionally includes one or more other physical user-interface devices,
such as a physical keyboard, a mouse and/or a joystick. Further, as described above, it
should be understood that the described electronic device, display and touch-sensitive
surface are optionally distributed amongst two or more devices. Therefore, as used in this
disclosure, information displayed on the electronic device or by the electronic device is
optionally used to describe information outputted by the electronic device for display on a
separate display device (touch-sensitive or not). Similarly, as used in this disclosure,
input received on the electronic device (e.g., touch input received on a touch-sensitive
surface of the electronic device) is optionally used to describe input received on a
separate input device, from which the electronic device receives input information.

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
[0027]          The device typically supports a variety of applications, such as one or
more of the following: a drawing application, a presentation application, a word
processing application, a website creation application, a disk authoring application, a
spreadsheet application, a gaming application, a telephone application, a video
conferencing application, an e-mail application, an instant messaging application, a
workout support application, a photo management application, a digital camera
application, a digital video camera application, a web browsing application, a digital
music player application, a television channel browsing application, and/or a digital video
player application.
[0028]          The various applications that are executed on the device optionally use at
least one common physical user-interface device, such as the touch-sensitive surface.
One or more functions of the touch-sensitive surface as well as corresponding information
displayed on the device are, optionally, adjusted and/or varied from one application to the
next and/or within a respective application. In this way, a common physical architecture
(such as the touch-sensitive surface) of the device optionally supports the variety of
applications with user interfaces that are intuitive and transparent to the user.
[0029]          Attention is now directed toward embodiments of portable or non-portable
devices with touch-sensitive displays, though the devices need not include touch-sensitive
displays or displays in general, as described above. Fig. 1A is a block diagram
illustrating portable or non-portable multifunction device 100 with touch-sensitive
displays 112 in accordance with some embodiments. Touch-sensitive display 112 is
sometimes called a "touch screen" for convenience, and is sometimes known as or called
a touch-sensitive display system. Device 100 includes memory 102 (which optionally
includes one or more computer readable storage mediums), memory controller 122, one
or more processing units (CPU's) 120, peripherals interface 118, RF circuitry 108, audio
circuitry 110, speaker 111, microphone 113, input/output (1/0) subsystem 106, other
input or control devices 116, and external port 124. Device 100 optionally includes one
or more optical sensors 164. Device 100 optionally includes one or more intensity
sensors 165 for detecting intensity of contacts on device 100 (e.g., a touch-sensitive
surface such as touch-sensitive display system 112 of device 100). Device 100 optionally
includes one or more tactile output generators 167 for generating tactile outputs on device
 100 (e.g., generating tactile outputs on a touch-sensitive surface such as touch-sensitive
                                               -5-

WO 2015/200537                                                             PCT/US2015/037520
display system 112 of device 100 or touchpad 355 of device 300). These components
optionally communicate over one or more communication buses or signal lines 103.
[0030]           As used in the specification and claims, the term "intensity" of a contact
on a touch-sensitive surface refers to the force or pressure (force per unit area) of a
contact (e.g., a finger contact) on the touch-sensitive surface, or to a substitute (proxy) for
the force or pressure of a contact on the touch-sensitive surface. The intensity of a
contact has a range of values that includes at least four distinct values and more typically
includes hundreds of distinct values (e.g., at least 256). Intensity of a contact is,
optionally, determined (or measured) using various approaches and various sensors or
combinations of sensors. For example, one or more force sensors underneath or adjacent
to the touch-sensitive surface are, optionally, used to measure force at various points on
the touch-sensitive surface. In some implementations, force measurements from multiple
force sensors are combined (e.g., a weighted average) to determine an estimated force of
a contact. Similarly, a pressure-sensitive tip of a stylus is, optionally, used to determine a
pressure of the stylus on the touch-sensitive surface. Alternatively, the size of the contact
area detected on the touch-sensitive surface and/or changes thereto, the capacitance of the
touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto, and/or the
resistance of the touch-sensitive surface proximate to the contact and/or changes thereto
are, optionally, used as a substitute for the force or pressure of the contact on the touch
sensitive surface. In some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact
force or pressure are used directly to determine whether an intensity threshold has been
exceeded (e.g., the intensity threshold is described in units corresponding to the substitute
measurements). In some implementations, the substitute measurements for contact force
or pressure are converted to an estimated force or pressure and the estimated force or
pressure is used to determine whether an intensity threshold has been exceeded (e.g., the
intensity threshold is a pressure threshold measured in units of pressure).
[0031]           As used in the specification and claims, the term "tactile output" refers to
physical displacement of a device relative to a previous position of the device, physical
displacement of a component (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) of a device relative to
another component (e.g., housing) of the device, or displacement of the component
relative to a center of mass of the device that will be detected by a user with the user's
sense of touch. For example, in situations where the device or the component of the
                                               -6-

WO 2015/200537                                                             PCT/US2015/037520
device is in contact with a surface of a user that is sensitive to touch (e.g., a finger, palm,
or other part of a user's hand), the tactile output generated by the physical displacement
will be interpreted by the user as a tactile sensation corresponding to a perceived change
in physical characteristics of the device or the component of the device. For example,
movement of a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touch-sensitive display or trackpad) is,
optionally, interpreted by the user as a "down click" or "up click" of a physical actuator
button. In some cases, a user will feel a tactile sensation such as an "down click" or "up
click" even when there is no movement of a physical actuator button associated with the
touch-sensitive surface that is physically pressed (e.g., displaced) by the user's
movements. As another example, movement of the touch-sensitive surface is, optionally,
interpreted or sensed by the user as "roughness" of the touch-sensitive surface, even when
there is no change in smoothness of the touch-sensitive surface. While such
interpretations of touch by a user will be subject to the individualized sensory perceptions
of the user, there are many sensory perceptions of touch that are common to a large
majority of users. Thus, when a tactile output is described as corresponding to a
particular sensory perception of a user (e.g., an "up click," a "down click," "roughness"),
unless otherwise stated, the generated tactile output corresponds to physical displacement
of the device or a component thereof that will generate the described sensory perception
for a typical (or average) user.
[0032]          It should be appreciated that device 100 is only one example of a portable
or non-portable multifunction device, and that device 100 optionally has more or fewer
components than shown, optionally combines two or more components, or optionally has
a different configuration or arrangement of the components. The various components
shown in Fig. 1A are implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both
hardware and software, including one or more signal processing and/or application
specific integrated circuits. Further, the various components shown in Fig. 1A are
optionally implemented across two or more devices; for example, a display and audio
circuitry on a display device, a touch-sensitive surface on an input device, and remaining
components on device 100. In such an embodiment, device 100 optionally communicates
with the display device and/or the input device to facilitate operation of the system, as
described in the disclosure, and the various components described herein that relate to
                                               -7-

display and/or input remain in device 100, or are optionally included in the display and/or
input device, as appropriate.
[0033]           Memory 102 optionally includes high-speed random access memory and
optionally also includes non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage
devices, flash memory devices, or other non-volatile solid-state memory devices. Access
to memory 102 by other components of device 100, such as CPU 120 and the peripherals
interface 118, is, optionally, controlled by memory controller 122.
[0034]           Peripherals interface 118 can be used to couple input and output
peripherals of the device to CPU 120 and memory 102. The one or more processors 120
run or execute various software programs and/or sets of instructions stored in memory
 102 to perform various functions for device 100 and to process data.
[0035]           In some embodiments, peripherals interface 118, CPU 120, and memory
controller 122 are, optionally, implemented on a single chip, such as chip 104. In some
other embodiments, they are, optionally, implemented on separate chips.
[0036]           RF (radio frequency) circuitry 108 receives and sends RF signals, also
called electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 converts electrical signals to/from
electromagnetic signals and communicates with communications networks and other
communications devices via the electromagnetic signals. RF circuitry 108 optionally
includes well-known circuitry for performing these functions, including but not limited to
an antenna system, an RF transceiver, one or more amplifiers, a tuner, one or more
oscillators, a digital signal processor, a CODEC chipset, a subscriber identity module
(SIM) card, memory, and so forth. RF circuitry 108 optionally communicates with
networks, such as the Internet, also referred to as the World Wide Web (WWW), an
intranet and/or a wireless network, such as a cellular telephone network, a wireless local
area network (LAN) and/or a metropolitan area network (MAN), and other devices by
wireless communication. The wireless communication optionally uses any of a plurality
of communications standards, protocols and technologies, including but not limited to
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Enhanced Data GSM Environment
(EDGE), high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA), high-speed uplink packet access
(HSUPA), Evolution, Data-Only (EV-DO), HSPA, HSPA+, Dual-Cell HSPA (DC
HSPDA), long term evolution (LTE), near field communication (NFC), wideband code

[0037]           Audio circuitry 110, speaker 111, and microphone 113 provide an audio
interface between a user and device 100. Audio circuitry 110 receives audio data from
peripherals interface 118, converts the audio data to an electrical signal, and transmits the
electrical signal to speaker 111. Speaker 111 converts the electrical signal to human
audible sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 also receives electrical signals converted by
microphone 113 from sound waves. Audio circuitry 110 converts the electrical signal to
audio data and transmits the audio data to peripherals interface 118 for processing. Audio
data is, optionally, retrieved from and/or transmitted to memory 102 and/or RF circuitry
 108 by peripherals interface 118. In some embodiments, audio circuitry 110 also includes
a headset jack (e.g., 212, Fig. 2). The headset jack provides an interface between audio
circuitry 110 and removable audio input/output peripherals, such as output-only
headphones or a headset with both output (e.g., a headphone for one or both ears) and
input (e.g., a microphone).
[0038]           I/O subsystem 106 couples input/output peripherals on device 100, such as
touch screen 112 and other input control devices 116, to peripherals interface 118. 1/0
subsystem 106 optionally includes display controller 156, optical sensor controller 158,
intensity sensor controller 159, haptic feedback controller 161 and one or more input
controllers 160 for other input or control devices. The one or more input controllers 160
receive/send electrical signals from/to other input or control devices 116. The other input
control devices 116 optionally include physical buttons (e.g., push buttons, rocker
buttons, etc.), dials, slider switches, joysticks, click wheels, and so forth. In some
alternate embodiments, input controller(s) 160 are, optionally, coupled to any (or none) of
                                                -9-

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
the following: a keyboard, infrared port, USB port, and a pointer device such as a mouse.
The one or more buttons (e.g., 208, Fig. 2) optionally include an up/down button for
volume control of speaker 111 and/or microphone 113. The one or more buttons
optionally include a push button (e.g., 206, Fig. 2).
[0039]          Touch-sensitive display 112 provides an input interface and an output
interface between the device and a user. As described above, the touch-sensitive
operation and the display operation of touch-sensitive display 112 are optionally
separated from each other, such that a display device is used for display purposes and a
touch-sensitive surface (whether display or not) is used for input detection purposes, and
the described components and functions are modified accordingly. However, for
simplicity, the following description is provided with reference to a touch-sensitive
display. Display controller 156 receives and/or sends electrical signals from/to touch
screen 112. Touch screen 112 displays visual output to the user. The visual output
optionally includes graphics, text, icons, video, and any combination thereof (collectively
termed "graphics"). In some embodiments, some or all of the visual output corresponds
to user-interface objects.
[0040]          Touch screen 112 has a touch-sensitive surface, sensor or set of sensors
that accepts input from the user based on haptic and/or tactile contact. Touch screen 112
and display controller 156 (along with any associated modules and/or sets of instructions
in memory 102) detect contact (and any movement or breaking of the contact) on touch
screen 112 and converts the detected contact into interaction with user-interface objects
(e.g., one or more soft keys, icons, web pages or images) that are displayed on touch
screen 112. In an exemplary embodiment, a point of contact between touch screen 112
and the user corresponds to a finger of the user.
[0041]          Touch screen 112 optionally uses LCD (liquid crystal display) technology,
LPD (light emitting polymer display) technology, or LED (light emitting diode)
technology, although other display technologies are used in other embodiments. Touch
screen 112 and display controller 156 optionally detect contact and any movement or
breaking thereof using any of a plurality of touch sensing technologies now known or
later developed, including but not limited to capacitive, resistive, infrared, and surface
acoustic wave technologies, as well as other proximity sensor arrays or other elements for
determining one or more points of contact with touch screen 112. In an exemplary

embodiment, projected mutual capacitance sensing technology is used, such as that found
in the iPhone@, iPod Touch@, and iPad@ from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California.
[0042]           Touch screen 112 optionally has a video resolution in excess of 100 dpi.
In some embodiments, the touch screen has a video resolution of approximately 160 dpi.
The user optionally makes contact with touch screen 112 using any suitable object or
appendage, such as a stylus, a finger, and so forth. In some embodiments, the user
interface is designed to work primarily with finger-based contacts and gestures, which
can be less precise than stylus-based input due to the larger area of contact of a finger on
the touch screen. In some embodiments, the device translates the rough finger-based
input into a precise pointer/cursor position or command for performing the actions desired
by the user.
[0043]           In some embodiments, in addition to the touch screen, device 100
optionally includes a touchpad (not shown) for activating or deactivating particular
functions. In some embodiments, the touchpad is a touch-sensitive area of the device
that, unlike the touch screen, does not display visual output. The touchpad is, optionally,
a touch-sensitive surface that is separate from touch screen 112 or an extension of the
touch-sensitive surface formed by the touch screen.
[0044]           Device 100 also includes power system 162 for powering the various
components. Power system 162 optionally includes a power management system, one or
more power sources (e.g., battery, alternating current (AC)), a recharging system, a power
failure detection circuit, a power converter or inverter, a power status indicator (e.g., a
light-emitting diode (LED)) and any other components associated with the generation,
management and distribution of power in portable or non-portable devices.
[0045]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more optical sensors 164.
Fig. 1A shows an optical sensor coupled to optical sensor controller 158 in I/O subsystem
 106. Optical sensor 164 optionally includes charge-coupled device (CCD) or
complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) phototransistors. Optical sensor 164
receives light from the environment, projected through one or more lens, and converts the
light to data representing an image. In conjunction with imaging module 143 (also called
a camera module), optical sensor 164 optionally captures still images or video. In some
embodiments, an optical sensor is located on the back of device 100, opposite touch
                                              -11-

for use as a viewfinder for still and/or video image acquisition. In some embodiments,
another optical sensor is located on the front of the device so that the user's image is,
optionally, obtained for videoconferencing while the user views the other video
conference participants on the touch screen display.
[0046]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more contact intensity sensors
 165. Fig. 1A shows a contact intensity sensor coupled to intensity sensor controller 159
in 1/0 subsystem 106. Contact intensity sensor 165 optionally includes one or more
piezoresistive strain gauges, capacitive force sensors, electric force sensors, piezoelectric
force sensors, optical force sensors, capacitive touch-sensitive surfaces, or other intensity
sensors (e.g., sensors used to measure the force (or pressure) of a contact on a touch
sensitive surface). Contact intensity sensor 165 receives contact intensity information
(e.g., pressure information or a proxy for pressure information) from the environment. In
some embodiments, at least one contact intensity sensor is collocated with, or proximate
to, a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112). In some
embodiments, at least one contact intensity sensor is located on the back of device 100,
opposite touch screen display 112 which is located on the front of device 100.
[0047]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more proximity sensors 166.
Fig. 1A shows proximity sensor 166 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately,
proximity sensor 166 is coupled to input controller 160 in 1/0 subsystem 106. In some
embodiments, the proximity sensor turns off and disables touch screen 112 when the
multifunction device is placed near the user's ear (e.g., when the user is making a phone
call).
[0048]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more tactile output generators
 167. Fig. 1A shows a tactile output generator coupled to haptic feedback controller 161
in 1/0 subsystem 106. Tactile output generator 167 optionally includes one or more
electroacoustic devices such as speakers or other audio components and/or
electromechanical devices that convert energy into linear motion such as a motor,
solenoid, electroactive polymer, piezoelectric actuator, electrostatic actuator, or other
tactile output generating component (e.g., a component that converts electrical signals
into tactile outputs on the device). Contact intensity sensor 165 receives tactile feedback
generation instructions from haptic feedback module 133 and generates tactile outputs on
                                              -12-

WO 2015/200537                                                           PCT/US2015/037520
device 100 that are capable of being sensed by a user of device 100. In some
embodiments, at least one tactile output generator is collocated with, or proximate to, a
touch-sensitive surface (e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112) and, optionally,
generates a tactile output by moving the touch-sensitive surface vertically (e.g., in/out of a
surface of device 100) or laterally (e.g., back and forth in the same plane as a surface of
device 100). In some embodiments, at least one tactile output generator sensor is located
on the back of device 100, opposite touch screen display 112 which is located on the front
of device 100.
[0049]           Device 100 optionally also includes one or more accelerometers 168. Fig.
 1A shows accelerometer 168 coupled to peripherals interface 118. Alternately,
accelerometer 168 is, optionally, coupled to an input controller 160 in 1/0 subsystem 106.
In some embodiments, information is displayed on the touch screen display in a portrait
view or a landscape view based on an analysis of data received from the one or more
accelerometers. Device 100 optionally includes, in addition to accelerometer(s) 168, a
magnetometer (not shown) and a GPS (or GLONASS or other global navigation system)
receiver (not shown) for obtaining information concerning the location and orientation
(e.g., portrait or landscape) of device 100.
[0050]           In some embodiments, the software components stored in memory 102
include operating system 126, communication module (or set of instructions) 128,
contact/motion module (or set of instructions) 130, graphics module (or set of
instructions) 132, text input module (or set of instructions) 134, Global Positioning
System (GPS) module (or set of instructions) 135, and applications (or sets of
instructions) 136. Furthermore, in some embodiments memory 102 stores device/global
internal state 157, as shown in Figs. 1A and 3. Device/global internal state 157 includes
one or more of: active application state, indicating which applications, if any, are
currently active; display state, indicating what applications, views or other information
occupy various regions of touch screen display 112; sensor state, including information
obtained from the device's various sensors and input control devices 116; and location
information concerning the device's location and/or attitude.
[0051]           Operating system 126 (e.g., Darwin, RTXC, LINUX, UNIX, OS X,
WINDOWS, or an embedded operating system such as VxWorks) includes various
software components and/or drivers for controlling and managing general system tasks
                                              -13-

WO 2015/200537                                                             PCT/US2015/037520
(e.g., memory management, storage device control, power management, etc.) and
facilitates communication between various hardware and software components.
[0052]          Communication module 128 facilitates communication with other devices
over one or more external ports 124 and also includes various software components for
handling data received by RF circuitry 108 and/or external port 124. External port 124
(e.g., Universal Serial Bus (USB), FIREWIRE, etc.) is adapted for coupling directly to
other devices or indirectly over a network (e.g., the Internet, wireless LAN, etc.). In some
embodiments, the external port is a multi-pin (e.g., 30-pin) connector that is the same as,
or similar to and/or compatible with the 30-pin connector used on iPod (trademark of
Apple Inc.) devices.
[0053]          Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects contact with touch screen
 112 (in conjunction with display controller 156) and other touch-sensitive devices (e.g., a
touchpad or physical click wheel). Contact/motion module 130 includes various software
components for performing various operations related to detection of contact, such as
determining if contact has occurred (e.g., detecting a finger-down event), determining an
intensity of the contact (e.g., the force or pressure of the contact or a substitute for the
force or pressure of the contact) determining if there is movement of the contact and
tracking the movement across the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., detecting one or more
finger-dragging events), and determining if the contact has ceased (e.g., detecting a
finger-up event or a break in contact). Contact/motion module 130 receives contact data
from the touch-sensitive surface. Determining movement of the point of contact, which is
represented by a series of contact data, optionally includes determining speed
(magnitude), velocity (magnitude and direction), and/or an acceleration (a change in
magnitude and/or direction) of the point of contact. These operations are, optionally,
applied to single contacts (e.g., one finger contacts) or to multiple simultaneous contacts
(e.g., "multitouch"/multiple finger contacts). In some embodiments, contact/motion
module 130 and display controller 156 detect contact on a touchpad.
[0054]          In some embodiments, contact/motion module 130 uses a set of one or
more intensity thresholds to determine whether an operation has been performed by a user
(e.g., to determine whether a user has "clicked" on an icon). In some embodiments at
least a subset of the intensity thresholds are determined in accordance with software
parameters (e.g., the intensity thresholds are not determined by the activation thresholds
                                               -14-

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
of particular physical actuators and can be adjusted without changing the physical
hardware of device 100). For example, a mouse "click" threshold of a trackpad or touch
screen display can be set to any of a large range of predefined thresholds values without
changing the trackpad or touch screen display hardware. Additionally, in some
implementations a user of the device is provided with software settings for adjusting one
or more of the set of intensity thresholds (e.g., by adjusting individual intensity thresholds
and/or by adjusting a plurality of intensity thresholds at once with a system-level click
"intensity" parameter).
[0055]          Contact/motion module 130 optionally detects a gesture input by a user.
Different gestures on the touch-sensitive surface have different contact patterns and
intensities. Thus, a gesture is, optionally, detected by detecting a particular contact
pattern. For example, detecting a finger tap gesture includes detecting a finger-down
event followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off) event at the same position (or
substantially the same position) as the finger-down event (e.g., at the position of an icon).
As another example, detecting a finger swipe gesture on the touch-sensitive surface
includes detecting a finger-down event followed by detecting one or more finger
dragging events, and subsequently followed by detecting a finger-up (lift off) event.
[0056]          Graphics module 132 includes various known software components for
rendering and displaying graphics on touch screen 112 or other display, including
components for changing the visual impact (e.g., brightness, transparency, saturation,
contrast or other visual property) of graphics that are displayed. As used herein, the term
"graphics" includes any object that can be displayed to a user, including without
limitation text, web pages, icons (such as user-interface objects including soft keys),
digital images, videos, animations and the like.
[0057]          In some embodiments, graphics module 132 stores data representing
graphics to be used. Each graphic is, optionally, assigned a corresponding code.
Graphics module 132 receives, from applications etc., one or more codes specifying
graphics to be displayed along with, if necessary, coordinate data and other graphic
property data, and then generates screen image data to output to display controller 156.

information for use in various applications (e.g., to telephone 138 for use in location
based dialing, to camera 143 as picture/video metadata, and to applications that provide
location-based services such as weather widgets, local yellow page widgets, and
map/navigation widgets).

external, connected display via external port 124), send an e-mail with a link to a
particular online video, and otherwise manage online videos in one or more file formats,
such as H.264. In some embodiments, instant messaging module 141, rather than e-mail
client module 140, is used to send a link to a particular online video.
[0080]          Each of the above identified modules and applications correspond to a set
of executable instructions for performing one or more functions described above and the
methods described in this application (e.g., the computer-implemented methods and other
information processing methods described herein). These modules (e.g., sets of
instructions) need not be implemented as separate software programs, procedures or
modules, and thus various subsets of these modules are, optionally, combined or
otherwise re-arranged in various embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 102
optionally stores a subset of the modules and data structures identified above.
Furthermore, memory 102 optionally stores additional modules and data structures not
described above.
[0081]          In some embodiments, device 100 is a device where operation of a
predefined set of functions on the device is performed exclusively through a touch screen
and/or a touchpad (whether included in device 100 or on a separate device, such as an
input device). By using a touch screen and/or a touchpad as the primary input control
device for operation of device 100, the number of physical input control devices (such as
push buttons, dials, and the like) on device 100 is, optionally, reduced.
[0082]          The predefined set of functions that are performed exclusively through a
touch screen and/or a touchpad optionally include navigation between user interfaces. In
some embodiments, the touchpad, when touched by the user, navigates device 100 to a
main, home, or root menu from any user interface that is displayed on device 100. In
some embodiments, a "menu button" is implemented using a touchpad. In some other
embodiments, the menu button is a physical push button or other physical input control
device instead of a touchpad.

Fig. 1A) or 370 (Fig. 3) includes event sorter 170 (e.g., in operating system 126) and a
respective application 136-1 (e.g., any of the aforementioned applications 137-151, 155,
380-390).
[0084]          Event sorter 170 receives event information and determines the application
 136-1 and application view 191 of application 136-1 to which to deliver the event
information. Event sorter 170 includes event monitor 171 and event dispatcher module
 174. In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes application internal state 192,
which indicates the current application view(s) displayed on touch-sensitive display 112
when the application is active or executing. In some embodiments, device/global internal
state 157 is used by event sorter 170 to determine which application(s) is (are) currently
active, and application internal state 192 is used by event sorter 170 to determine
application views 191 to which to deliver event information.
[0085]          In some embodiments, application internal state 192 includes additional
information, such as one or more of: resume information to be used when application
 136-1 resumes execution, user interface state information that indicates information being
displayed or that is ready for display by application 136-1, a state queue for enabling the
user to go back to a prior state or view of application 136-1, and a redo/undo queue of
previous actions taken by the user.
[0086]          Event monitor 171 receives event information from peripherals interface
 118. Event information includes information about a sub-event (e.g., a user touch on
touch-sensitive display 112, as part of a multi-touch gesture). Peripherals interface 118
transmits information it receives from 1/0 subsystem 106 or a sensor, such as proximity
sensor 166, accelerometer(s) 168, and/or microphone 113 (through audio circuitry 110).
Information that peripherals interface 118 receives from 1/0 subsystem 106 includes
information from touch-sensitive display 112 or a touch-sensitive surface.
[0087]          In some embodiments, event monitor 171 sends requests to the peripherals
interface 118 at predetermined intervals. In response, peripherals interface 118 transmits
event information. In other embodiments, peripheral interface 118 transmits event
information only when there is a significant event (e.g., receiving an input above a
predetermined noise threshold and/or for more than a predetermined duration).

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
[0088]          In some embodiments, event sorter 170 also includes a hit view
determination module 172 and/or an active event recognizer determination module 173.
[0089]          Hit view determination module 172 provides software procedures for
determining where a sub-event has taken place within one or more views, when touch
sensitive display 112 displays more than one view. Views are made up of controls and
other elements that a user can see on the display.
[0090]          Another aspect of the user interface associated with an application is a set
of views, sometimes herein called application views or user interface windows, in which
information is displayed and touch-based gestures occur. The application views (of a
respective application) in which a touch is detected optionally correspond to
programmatic levels within a programmatic or view hierarchy of the application. For
example, the lowest level view in which a touch is detected is, optionally, called the hit
view, and the set of events that are recognized as proper inputs are, optionally,
determined based, at least in part, on the hit view of the initial touch that begins a touch
based gesture.
[0091]          Hit view determination module 172 receives information related to
sub-events of a touch-based gesture. When an application has multiple views organized
in a hierarchy, hit view determination module 172 identifies a hit view as the lowest view
in the hierarchy which should handle the sub-event. In most circumstances, the hit view
is the lowest level view in which an initiating sub-event occurs (e.g., the first sub-event in
the sequence of sub-events that form an event or potential event). Once the hit view is
identified by the hit view determination module, the hit view typically receives all sub
events related to the same touch or input source for which it was identified as the hit
view.
[0092]          Active event recognizer determination module 173 determines which view
or views within a view hierarchy should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In
some embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that
only the hit view should receive a particular sequence of sub-events. In other
embodiments, active event recognizer determination module 173 determines that all
views that include the physical location of a sub-event are actively involved views, and
therefore determines that all actively involved views should receive a particular sequence
                                             -23-

WO 2015/200537                                                          PCT/US2015/037520
of sub-events. In other embodiments, even if touch sub-events were entirely confined to
the area associated with one particular view, views higher in the hierarchy would still
remain as actively involved views.
[0093]          Event dispatcher module 174 dispatches the event information to an event
recognizer (e.g., event recognizer 180). In embodiments including active event
recognizer determination module 173, event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event
information to an event recognizer determined by active event recognizer determination
module 173. In some embodiments, event dispatcher module 174 stores in an event
queue the event information, which is retrieved by a respective event receiver module
 182.
[0094]          In some embodiments, operating system 126 includes event sorter 170.
Alternatively, application 136-1 includes event sorter 170. In yet other embodiments,
event sorter 170 is a stand-alone module, or a part of another module stored in memory
 102, such as contact/motion module 130.
[0095]          In some embodiments, application 136-1 includes a plurality of event
handlers 190 and one or more application views 191, each of which includes instructions
for handling touch events that occur within a respective view of the application's user
interface. Each application view 191 of the application 136-1 includes one or more event
recognizers 180. Typically, a respective application view 191 includes a plurality of
event recognizers 180. In other embodiments, one or more of event recognizers 180 are
part of a separate module, such as a user interface kit (not shown) or a higher level object
from which application 136-1 inherits methods and other properties. In some
embodiments, a respective event handler 190 includes one or more of: data updater 176,
object updater 177, GUI updater 178, and/or event data 179 received from event sorter
 170. Event handler 190 optionally utilizes or calls data updater 176, object updater 177
or GUI updater 178 to update the application internal state 192. Alternatively, one or
more of the application views 191 includes one or more respective event handlers 190.
Also, in some embodiments, one or more of data updater 176, object updater 177, and
GUI updater 178 are included in a respective application view 191.
[0096]          A respective event recognizer 180 receives event information (e.g., event
data 179) from event sorter 170, and identifies an event from the event information.

Event recognizer 180 includes event receiver 182 and event comparator 184. In some
embodiments, event recognizer 180 also includes at least a subset of: metadata 183, and
event delivery instructions 188 (which optionally include sub-event delivery instructions).
[0097]           Event receiver 182 receives event information from event sorter 170. The
event information includes information about a sub-event, for example, a touch or a touch
movement. Depending on the sub-event, the event information also includes additional
information, such as location of the sub-event. When the sub-event concerns motion of a
touch, the event information optionally also includes speed and direction of the sub-event.
In some embodiments, events include rotation of the device from one orientation to
another (e.g., from a portrait orientation to a landscape orientation, or vice versa), and the
event information includes corresponding information about the current orientation (also
called device attitude) of the device.
[0098]           Event comparator 184 compares the event information to predefined event
or sub-event definitions and, based on the comparison, determines an event or sub-event,
or determines or updates the state of an event or sub-event. In some embodiments, event
comparator 184 includes event definitions 186. Event definitions 186 contain definitions
of events (e.g., predefined sequences of sub-events), for example, event 1 (187-1), event 2
(187-2), and others. In some embodiments, sub-events in an event 187 include, for
example, touch begin, touch end, touch movement, touch cancellation, and multiple
touching. In one example, the definition for event 1 (187-1) is a double tap on a
displayed object. The double tap, for example, comprises a first touch (touch begin) on
the displayed object for a predetermined phase, a first lift-off (touch end) for a
predetermined phase, a second touch (touch begin) on the displayed object for a
predetermined phase, and a second lift-off (touch end) for a predetermined phase. In
another example, the definition for event 2 (187-2) is a dragging on a displayed object.
The dragging, for example, comprises a touch (or contact) on the displayed object for a
predetermined phase, a movement of the touch across touch-sensitive display 112, and
lift-off of the touch (touch end). In some embodiments, the event also includes
information for one or more associated event handlers 190.
[0099]           In some embodiments, event definition 187 includes a definition of an
event for a respective user-interface object. In some embodiments, event comparator 184
performs a hit test to determine which user-interface object is associated with a sub-event.
                                              -25-

WO 2015/200537                                                           PCT/US2015/037520
For example, in an application view in which three user-interface objects are displayed on
touch-sensitive display 112, when a touch is detected on touch-sensitive display 112,
event comparator 184 performs a hit test to determine which of the three user-interface
objects is associated with the touch (sub-event). If each displayed object is associated
with a respective event handler 190, the event comparator uses the result of the hit test to
determine which event handler 190 should be activated. For example, event comparator
 184 selects an event handler associated with the sub-event and the object triggering the hit
test.
[00100]          In some embodiments, the definition for a respective event 187 also
includes delayed actions that delay delivery of the event information until after it has been
determined whether the sequence of sub-events does or does not correspond to the event
recognizer's event type.
[00101]          When a respective event recognizer 180 determines that the series of sub
events do not match any of the events in event definitions 186, the respective event
recognizer 180 enters an event impossible, event failed, or event ended state, after which
it disregards subsequent sub-events of the touch-based gesture. In this situation, other
event recognizers, if any, that remain active for the hit view continue to track and process
sub-events of an ongoing touch-based gesture.
[00102]          In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 includes
metadata 183 with configurable properties, flags, and/or lists that indicate how the event
delivery system should perform sub-event delivery to actively involved event recognizers.
In some embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists
that indicate how event recognizers interact, or are enabled to interact, with one another.
In some embodiments, metadata 183 includes configurable properties, flags, and/or lists
that indicate whether sub-events are delivered to varying levels in the view or
programmatic hierarchy.
[00103]          In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 activates event
handler 190 associated with an event when one or more particular sub-events of an event
are recognized. In some embodiments, a respective event recognizer 180 delivers event
information associated with the event to event handler 190. Activating an event handler
 190 is distinct from sending (and deferred sending) sub-events to a respective hit view. In
                                             -26-

WO 2015/200537                                                          PCT/US2015/037520
some embodiments, event recognizer 180 throws a flag associated with the recognized
event, and event handler 190 associated with the flag catches the flag and performs a
predefined process.
[00104]         In some embodiments, event delivery instructions 188 include sub-event
delivery instructions that deliver event information about a sub-event without activating
an event handler. Instead, the sub-event delivery instructions deliver event information to
event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or to actively involved views.
Event handlers associated with the series of sub-events or with actively involved views
receive the event information and perform a predetermined process.
[00105]         In some embodiments, data updater 176 creates and updates data used in
application 136-1. For example, data updater 176 updates the telephone number used in
contacts module 137, or stores a video file used in video player module 145. In some
embodiments, object updater 177 creates and updates objects used in application 136-1.
For example, object updater 176 creates a new user-interface object or updates the
position of a user-interface object. GUI updater 178 updates the GUI. For example, GUI
updater 178 prepares display information and sends it to graphics module 132 for display
on a touch-sensitive display.
[00106]         In some embodiments, event handler(s) 190 includes or has access to data
updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178. In some embodiments, data
updater 176, object updater 177, and GUI updater 178 are included in a single module of
a respective application 136-1 or application view 191. In other embodiments, they are
included in two or more software modules.
[00107]         It shall be understood that the foregoing discussion regarding event
handling of user touches on touch-sensitive displays and/or touchpads also applies to
other forms of user inputs to operate multifunction devices 100 with input-devices, not all
of which are initiated on touch screens. For example, mouse movement and mouse
button presses, optionally coordinated with single or multiple keyboard presses or holds;
contact movements such as taps, drags, scrolls, etc., on touch-pads; pen stylus inputs;
movement of the device; oral instructions; detected eye movements; biometric inputs;
and/or any combination thereof are optionally utilized as inputs corresponding to sub
events which define an event to be recognized.

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
[00108]         Fig. 2 illustrates a portable or non-portable multifunction device 100
having a touch screen 112 in accordance with some embodiments. As stated above,
multifunction device 100 is described as having the various illustrated structures (such as
touch screen 112, speaker 111, accelerometer 168, microphone 113, etc.); however, it is
understood that these structures optionally reside on separate devices. For example,
display-related structures (e.g., display, speaker, etc.) and/or functions optionally reside
on a separate display device, input-related structures (e.g., touch-sensitive surface,
microphone, accelerometer, etc.) and/or functions optionally reside on a separate input
device, and remaining structures and/or functions optionally reside on multifunction
device 100.
[00109]         The touch screen 112 optionally displays one or more graphics within user
interface (UI) 200. In this embodiment, as well as others described below, a user is
enabled to select one or more of the graphics by making a gesture on the graphics, for
example, with one or more fingers 202 (not drawn to scale in the figure) or one or more
styluses 203 (not drawn to scale in the figure). In some embodiments, selection of one or
more graphics occurs when the user breaks contact with the one or more graphics. In
some embodiments, the gesture optionally includes one or more taps, one or more swipes
(from left to right, right to left, upward and/or downward) and/or a rolling of a finger
(from right to left, left to right, upward and/or downward) that has made contact with
device 100. In some implementations or circumstances, inadvertent contact with a
graphic does not select the graphic. For example, a swipe gesture that sweeps over an
application icon optionally does not select the corresponding application when the gesture
corresponding to selection is a tap.
[00110]         Device 100 optionally also includes one or more physical buttons, such as
"home" or menu button 204. As described previously, menu button 204 is, optionally,
used to navigate to any application 136 in a set of applications that are, optionally
executed on device 100. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the menu button is
implemented as a soft key in a GUI displayed on touch screen 112.
[00111]         In one embodiment, device 100 includes touch screen 112, menu button
204, push button 206 for powering the device on/off and locking the device, volume
adjustment button(s) 208, Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card slot 210, head set jack
212, and docking/charging external port 124. Push button 206 is, optionally, used to turn
                                               -28-

the power on/off on the device by depressing the button and holding the button in the
depressed state for a predefined time interval; to lock the device by depressing the button
and releasing the button before the predefined time interval has elapsed; and/or to unlock
the device or initiate an unlock process. In an alternative embodiment, device 100 also
accepts verbal input for activation or deactivation of some functions through microphone
 113. Device 100 also, optionally, includes one or more contact intensity sensors 165 for
detecting intensity of contacts on touch screen 112 and/or one or more tactile output
generators 167 for generating tactile outputs for a user of device 100.
[00112]          Fig. 3 is a block diagram of an exemplary multifunction device with a
display and a touch-sensitive surface in accordance with some embodiments. Device 300
need not include the display and the touch-sensitive surface, as described above, but
rather, in some embodiments, optionally communicates with the display and the touch
sensitive surface on other devices. Additionally, device 300 need not be portable. In
some embodiments, device 300 is a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a tablet
computer, a multimedia player device (such as a television or a set-top box), a navigation
device, an educational device (such as a child's learning toy), a gaming system, or a
control device (e.g., a home or industrial controller). Device 300 typically includes one
or more processing units (CPU's) 310, one or more network or other communications
interfaces 360, memory 370, and one or more communication buses 320 for
interconnecting these components. Communication buses 320 optionally include
circuitry (sometimes called a chipset) that interconnects and controls communications
between system components. Device 300 includes input/output (1/0) interface 330
comprising display 340, which is typically a touch screen display. 1/0 interface 330 also
optionally includes a keyboard and/or mouse (or other pointing device) 350 and touchpad
355, tactile output generator 357 for generating tactile outputs on device 300 (e.g., similar
to tactile output generator(s) 167 described above with reference to Fig. 1A), sensors 359
(e.g., optical, acceleration, proximity, touch-sensitive, and/or contact intensity sensors
similar to contact intensity sensor(s) 165 described above with reference to Fig. 1A).
Memory 370 includes high-speed random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, DDR

370 optionally includes one or more storage devices remotely located from CPU(s) 310.
In some embodiments, memory 370 stores programs, modules, and data structures
analogous to the programs, modules, and data structures stored in memory 102 of
portable or non-portable multifunction device 100 (Fig. 1A), or a subset thereof.
Furthermore, memory 370 optionally stores additional programs, modules, and data
structures not present in memory 102 of portable or non-portable multifunction device
 100. For example, memory 370 of device 300 optionally stores drawing module 380,
presentation module 382, word processing module 384, website creation module 386,
disk authoring module 388, and/or spreadsheet module 390, while memory 102 of
portable or non-portable multifunction device 100 (Fig. 1A) optionally does not store
these modules.
[00113]         Each of the above identified elements in Fig. 3 are, optionally, stored in
one or more of the previously mentioned memory devices. Each of the above identified
modules corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a function described above.
The above identified modules or programs (e.g., sets of instructions) need not be
implemented as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various
subsets of these modules are, optionally, combined or otherwise re-arranged in various
embodiments. In some embodiments, memory 370 optionally stores a subset of the
modules and data structures identified above. Furthermore, memory 370 optionally stores
additional modules and data structures not described above.
[00114]         Fig. 4 illustrates an exemplary user interface on a device (e.g., device 300,
Fig. 3) with a touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a tablet or touchpad 355, Fig. 3) that is
separate from the display 450 (e.g., touch screen display 112). Device 300 also,
optionally, includes one or more contact intensity sensors (e.g., one or more of sensors
357) for detecting intensity of contacts on touch-sensitive surface 451 and/or one or more
tactile output generators 359 for generating tactile outputs for a user of device 300.
[00115]         Although some of the examples which follow will be given with reference
to inputs on touch screen display 112 (where the touch sensitive surface and the display
are combined), in some embodiments, the device detects inputs on a touch-sensitive
surface that is separate from the display, as shown in Fig. 4. In some embodiments the
touch sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in Fig. 4) has a primary axis (e.g., 452 in Fig. 4) that
corresponds to a primary axis (e.g., 453 in Fig. 4) on the display (e.g., 450). In
                                              -30-

WO 2015/200537                                                             PCT/US2015/037520
accordance with these embodiments, the device detects contacts (e.g., 460 and 462 in Fig.
4) with the touch-sensitive surface 451 at locations that correspond to respective locations
on the display (e.g., in Fig. 4, 460 corresponds to 468 and 462 corresponds to 470). In
this way, user inputs (e.g., contacts 460 and 462, and movements thereof) detected by the
device on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., 451 in Fig. 4) are used by the device to
manipulate the user interface on the display (e.g., 450 in Fig. 4) of the multifunction
device when the touch-sensitive surface is separate from the display. It should be
understood that similar methods are, optionally, used for other user interfaces described
herein.
[00116]          Additionally, while the following examples are given primarily with
reference to finger inputs (e.g., finger contacts, finger tap gestures, finger swipe gestures),
it should be understood that, in some embodiments, one or more of the finger inputs are
replaced with input from another input device (e.g., a mouse based input or stylus input).
For example, a swipe gesture is, optionally, replaced with a mouse click (e.g., instead of a
contact) followed by movement of the cursor along the path of the swipe (e.g., instead of
movement of the contact). As another example, a tap gesture is, optionally, replaced with
a mouse click while the cursor is located over the location of the tap gesture (e.g., instead
of detection of the contact followed by ceasing to detect the contact). Similarly, when
multiple user inputs are simultaneously detected, it should be understood that multiple
computer mice are, optionally, used simultaneously, or a mouse and finger contacts are,
optionally, used simultaneously.
[00117]          As used herein, the term "focus selector" refers to an input element that
indicates a current part of a user interface with which a user is interacting. In some
implementations that include a cursor or other location marker, the cursor acts as a "focus
selector," so that when an input (e.g., a press input) is detected on a touch-sensitive
surface (e.g., touchpad 355 in Fig. 3 or touch-sensitive surface 451 in Fig. 4) while the
cursor is over a particular user interface element (e.g., a button, window, slider or other
user interface element), the particular user interface element is adjusted in accordance
with the detected input. In some implementations that include a touch-screen display
(e.g., touch-sensitive display system 112 in Fig. 1A) that enables direct interaction with
user interface elements on the touch-screen display, a detected contact on the touch
screen acts as a "focus selector," so that when an input (e.g., a press input by the contact)

WO 2015/200537                                                             PCT/US2015/037520
is detected on the touch-screen display at a location of a particular user interface element
(e.g., a button, window, slider or other user interface element), the particular user
interface element is adjusted in accordance with the detected input. In some
implementations focus is moved from one region of a user interface to another region of
the user interface without corresponding movement of a cursor or movement of a contact
on a touch-screen display (e.g., by using a tab key or arrow keys to move focus from one
button to another button); in these implementations, the focus selector moves in
accordance with movement of focus between different regions of the user interface.
Without regard to the specific form taken by the focus selector, the focus selector is
generally the user interface element (or contact on a touch-screen display) that is
controlled by the user so as to communicate the user's intended interaction with the user
interface (e.g., by indicating, to the device, the element of the user interface with which
the user is intending to interact). For example, the location of a focus selector (e.g., a
cursor, a contact or a selection box) over a respective button while a press input is
detected on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a touchpad or touch screen) will indicate that
the user is intending to activate the respective button (as opposed to other user interface
elements shown on a display of the device).
[00118]          In some embodiments described herein, one or more operations are
performed in response to detecting a gesture that includes a respective press input or in
response to detecting the respective press input performed with a respective contact (or a
plurality of contacts), where the respective press input is detected based at least in part on
detecting an increase in intensity of the contact (or plurality of contacts) above a press
input intensity threshold. In some embodiments, the respective operation is performed in
response to detecting the increase in intensity of the respective contact above the press
input intensity threshold (e.g., a "down stroke" of the respective press input). In some
embodiments, the press input includes an increase in intensity of the respective contact
above the press-input intensity threshold and a subsequent decrease in intensity of the
contact below the press-input intensity threshold, and the respective operation is
performed in response to detecting the subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective
contact below the press-input threshold (e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input).
[00119]          In some embodiments, the device employs intensity hysteresis to avoid
accidental inputs sometimes termed "jitter," where the device defines or selects a
                                              -32-

hysteresis intensity threshold with a predefined relationship to the press-input intensity
threshold (e.g., the hysteresis intensity threshold is X intensity units lower than the press
input intensity threshold or the hysteresis intensity threshold is 75%, 90% or some
reasonable proportion of the press-input intensity threshold). Thus, in some
embodiments, the press input includes an increase in intensity of the respective contact
above the press-input intensity threshold and a subsequent decrease in intensity of the
contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold that corresponds to the press-input
intensity threshold, and the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the
subsequent decrease in intensity of the respective contact below the hysteresis intensity
threshold (e.g., an "up stroke" of the respective press input). Similarly, in some
embodiments, the press input is detected only when the device detects an increase in
intensity of the contact from an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity threshold to
an intensity at or above the press-input intensity threshold and, optionally, a subsequent
decrease in intensity of the contact to an intensity at or below the hysteresis intensity, and
the respective operation is performed in response to detecting the press input (e.g., the
increase in intensity of the contact or the decrease in intensity of the contact, depending
on the circumstances).
[00120]         For ease of explanation, the description of operations performed in
response to a press input associated with a press-input intensity threshold or in response
to a gesture including the press input are, optionally, triggered in response to detecting
either: an increase in intensity of a contact above the press-input intensity threshold, an
increase in intensity of a contact from an intensity below the hysteresis intensity threshold
to an intensity above the press-input intensity threshold, a decrease in intensity of the
contact below the press-input intensity threshold, and/or a decrease in intensity of the
contact below the hysteresis intensity threshold corresponding to the press-input intensity
threshold. Additionally, in examples where an operation is described as being performed
in response to detecting a decrease in intensity of a contact below the press-input intensity
threshold, the operation is, optionally, performed in response to detecting a decrease in
intensity of the contact below a hysteresis intensity threshold corresponding to, and lower
than, the press-input intensity threshold.

[00123]         In circumstances where a user interacts with an electronic device using an
input device, such as a touch-sensitive surface, it can be beneficial to the user's
experience for the electronic device to provide the user with information about
functionalities ("functionality information") that may be accessible from the input device.
This can be particularly true in circumstances in which the input device itself contains no
visible information about such functionalities-for example, a touch-sensitive surface
having a blank, uniform surface. The embodiments described below provide ways to
present such functionality information. Enhancing interactions with a device reduces the
amount of time needed by a user to perform operations, and thus reduces the power usage
of the device and increases battery life for battery-powered devices.
[00124]         It is understood that people use devices. When a person uses a device, that
person is optionally referred to as a user of the device. Thus, in this disclosure, references
to a "person" or "people" are optionally interchangeable with references to a "user" or
"users", and references to a "user" or "users" are optionally interchangeable with
references to a "person" or "people".
[00125]         Figs. 6A-6G illustrate exemplary ways in which functionality information
is presented in a user interface in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.
The embodiments in these figures are used to illustrate the processes described below,
including the processes described with reference to Figs. 7A-7G.
[00126]         Fig. 6A illustrates exemplary display 450 and touch-sensitive surface 451.
Display 450 (e.g., a television or other display device) and touch-sensitive surface 451 are
optionally integrated with and/or otherwise in communication with a device such as
device 500 as described above with reference to Fig. 5-for example, a set top box or
other user interface generating device that is in communication with a remote control and
a display device. Display 450 optionally displays one or more user interfaces that include
various content. Touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally includes a plurality of predefined
regions 602, 604, 606, 608, 610, 612, 614, 616, and 618. In some embodiments, one or
more of predefined regions 602, 604, 606, 608, 610, 612, 614, 616, and 618 are selectable
to perform a functionality associated with the respective predefined region (e.g., one or
more of the regions are selectable to perform a functionality, including reverse skipping,
forward skipping, rewinding, fast-forwarding, scrubbing and displaying information
associated with a content item in a user interface displayed on display 450). Further

exemplary functionalities are described below. In particular, in some embodiments,
tapping in one of the predefined regions performs the functionality associated with the
predefined region; in some embodiments, clicking in the predefined region performs the
functionality associated with the predefined region; in some embodiments, one or more
other inputs detected in the predefined region perform the functionality associated with
the predefined region. For example, in some embodiments, clicking in region 612 (e.g.,
detecting the clicking of a button while detecting a contact, such as contact 601 or a
different contact, on region 612, or detecting an increase in the intensity of a contact, such
as contact 601 or a different contact, detected in region 612 above a predetermined
intensity threshold) performs a fast-forward operation for content displayed on display
450 while detecting a contact on region 612. The surface of touch-sensitive surface 451
is optionally visibly uniform, and optionally does not provide a visual indication of the
existence of predefined regions 602, 604, 606, 608, 610, 612, 614, 616, and 618, and/or
their associated functionalities. Thus, it can be beneficial to display such information on
display 450.
[00127]         In some embodiments, receiving an indication of contact 601 detected on
touch-sensitive surface 451, and determining whether the contact has been detected for
longer than a first time period (e.g., determining whether a resting finger has been
detected on the touch-sensitive surface of the remote for at least a threshold amount of
time such as 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, or 1 seconds), initiates a process by which functionality
information is optionally determined and/or displayed on display 450. In some
embodiments, contact 601 need not be detected for longer than the first time period, but
rather tapping on touch-sensitive surface initiates the process by which functionality
information is optionally determined and/or displayed on display 450. As shown in Fig.
6A, in some embodiments, contact 601 has been detected in predefined region 610,
though it is understood that a contact detected anywhere on touch-sensitive surface 451
optionally initiates the determination and/or display of functionality information. In some
embodiments, functionality information is determined and/or displayed not in response to
detection of an input for displaying the functionality information, but rather in response to
a determination that one or more functions are accessible from the touch-sensitive surface
based on a state of a user interface on display 450-for example, selection of a user
interface element (e.g., an application or a channel) in the user interface optionally results

WO 2015/200537                                                             PCT/US2015/037520
in the display of functionality information relating to the selected user interface element
(e.g., functionality information for deleting the application or the channel from an
application or channel bar). The discussion that follows focuses on embodiments in
which functionality information is displayed in response to detection of an input for
displaying the functionality information, though it is understood that the scope of the
disclosure is not so limited, as described above.
[00128]          In accordance with a determination that contact 601 meets functionality
display criteria (e.g., one or more criterion) that include a criterion that is met when the
contact has been detected for longer than the first time period, in some embodiments,
functionality information is determined for display in a user interface for display on
display 450, the functionality information including information about a first functionality
of the plurality of functionalities associated with predefined regions 602, 604, 606, 608,
610, 612, 614, 616, and 618. This determination involves, for example, determining a
respective functionality for which functionality information is to be displayed, and then
selecting pre-generated functionality information that corresponds to the respective
functionality or generating the functionality information that is to be displayed on display
450 (e.g., resting a finger anywhere on touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally brings up
information about one or more functionalities accessible from the touch-sensitive
surface). In some embodiments, the functionality information includes one or more icons
that are displayed in a user interface on display 450 that indicate functions of
corresponding regions of the touch-sensitive surface. In some embodiments, the
information about the first functionality comprises a visual cue for performing the first
functionality (e.g., a visual display about the functionality to be performed, how to
perform the functionality from the remote, etc.).
[00129]          In accordance with a determination that contact 601 does not meet the
functionality display criteria (e.g., because the contact has not been detected for longer
than the first time period or because the contact has not been substantially stationary for
longer than the first time period), the electronic device optionally forgoes determination
of the functionality information including the information about the first functionality of
the plurality of associated functionalities (e.g., icons or information indicating the
functionalities of the different regions of touch-sensitive surface 451 are not displayed if
the contact ends before the first time period has been reached).

[00130]         In some embodiments, the functionality display criteria include a criterion
that is met when the contact has moved less than a first movement threshold during the
first time period (e.g., in order to display the functionality information, in some
embodiments, the contact must be a substantially stationary contact).
[00131]         Fig. 6B illustrates exemplary functionality information displayed in a user
interface on display 450 in accordance with a determination that contact 601 meets the
functionality display criteria. Functionality information 620 optionally includes
information about a functionality that is accessible from touch sensitive surface 451 (e.g.,
fast forward), and/or information about how to access the functionality (e.g., clicking in
predefined region 612). In some embodiments, the functionality information comprises
an overlay displayed over a moving image or a still image in the user interface displayed
by display 450.
[00132]         Fig. 6C illustrates exemplary selection of a functionality accessible from
touch-sensitive surface 451. As described above, selection of a functionality is optionally
accomplished when an indication of an input ("second input") detected on the predefined
region associated with the functionality is received. As shown in Fig. 6C, in some
embodiments, selection of the fast forward functionality is accomplished by detecting a
click in predefined region 612, as shown. In response to receiving the indication of the
second input, the electronic device optionally performs the functionality associated with
the predefined region on which the second input was detected.
[00133]         In some embodiments, detecting the second input (e.g., the click)
comprises detecting the second input concurrently with the contact (e.g., contact 601) on
touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a click in predefined region 612 is optionally detected in
response to contact 601 moving to predefined region 612 and providing a click input,
without contact lifting off touch-sensitive surface). In some embodiments, detecting the
second input comprises detecting a second contact (e.g., one or more of a tap, a click and
a resting touch) on predefined region 612 of touch-sensitive surface 451. In some
embodiments, detecting the second input comprises detecting an increase in an intensity
of the contact above a first predetermined intensity threshold (e.g., a mechanical click or
force detection).

[00134]          In some embodiments, detection of contacts having different intensities
results in the device performing different functionalities. In some embodiments, the
electronic device optionally receives an indication of a third input detected on the first
predefined region (e.g., predefined region 612) of touch-sensitive surface 451 that is
associated with the first functionality (e.g., fast forward), wherein detecting the third input
comprises detecting a second increase in the intensity of the contact (e.g., contact 601)
above a second predetermined intensity threshold (e.g., multi-level click), the second
predetermined intensity threshold being greater than the first predetermined intensity
threshold. In response to receiving the indication of the third input, the electronic device
optionally forgoes performance of the first functionality (e.g., fast forward) associated
with the first predefined region (e.g., predefined region 612) on the touch-sensitive
surface, and performs a second functionality associated with the first predefined region
(e.g., predefined region 612) of the touch-sensitive surface, the second functionality being
different than the first functionality (e.g., a double-level click optionally performs a
different functionality than a single-level click).
[00135]          In some embodiments, prior to performing the second functionality, the
electronic device replaces the functionality information in the user interface (e.g.,
functionality information 620) with second functionality information (e.g., updated
functionality information about the second functionality), the second functionality
information including second information about the second functionality associated with
the first predefined region of the touch-sensitive surface.
[00136]          In some embodiments, detecting a click-and-hold-type input performs a
different functionality than a click-type input. In some embodiments, detecting the
second input further comprises detecting the contact (e.g., contact 601) on the touch
sensitive surface of the device for longer than a second time period after detecting the
increase in the intensity of the contact above the first predetermined intensity threshold
(e.g., clicking and holding for at least a threshold amount of time such as 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, or
 1 seconds). In response to receiving the indication of the second input, the electronic
device optionally forgoes performance of the first functionality associated with the first
predefined region on the touch-sensitive surface, and performs a second functionality
associated with the first predefined region of the touch-sensitive surface, the second
functionality being different than the first functionality (e.g., click-and-hold initiates

different functionality than only click). Similar to above, in some embodiments, prior to
performing the second functionality, the electronic device replaces the functionality
information in the user interface with second functionality information, the second
functionality information including second information about the second functionality
associated with the first predefined region of the touch-sensitive surface.
[00137]          In some embodiments, the functionalities accessible from predefined
regions 602, 604, 606, 608, 610, 612, 614, 616, and 618 of touch-sensitive surface 451
are based on a current context of the user interface (e.g., what kind of content is displayed
in the user interface) displayed on display 450. In some embodiments, a first predefined
region (e.g., predefined region 612) of the plurality of predefined regions on the touch
sensitive surface of the device is associated with a first set of functionalities, the first set
of functionalities including the first functionality (e.g., the middle-right region of touch
sensitive surface is optionally associated with fast-forwarding and skipping an
advertisement). Determining the functionality information for display in response to
receiving the indication of the first input optionally comprises determining a current
context of the user interface (e.g., what kind of content is displayed in the user interface),
and selecting the first functionality from the first set of functionalities based on the
current context of the user interface.
[00138]          In some embodiments, selecting the first functionality from the first set of
functionalities based on the current context of the user interface includes, in accordance
with a determination that the current context is a first context (e.g., an advertisement
displayed in the user interface, a collection of music displayed in the user interface, an
application displayed in the user interface, a collection of photos displayed in the user
interface), the first functionality corresponds to a first operation (e.g., skipping the
advertisement, navigating to a page of the collection of music, switching to another
application, navigating to a page of the collection of photos), and in accordance with a
determination that the current context is a second context, different from the first context
(e.g., a movie displayed in the user interface, a television channel displayed in the user
interface, a content information page displayed in the user interface), the first
functionality corresponds to a second operation, different from the first operation (e.g.,
fast-forwarding the movie, changing the channel, viewing more content information).

[00139]          It should be noted that in some embodiments, the functionalities described
herein are optionally accessed without first displaying the functionality information that is
described-in some embodiments, the displaying of the functionality information simply
provides information as to what functionalities are optionally accessible from touch
sensitive surface 451.
[00140]          Fig. 6D illustrates exemplary functionality information displayed in a user
interface on display 450. In some embodiments, functionality information 622 comprises
an icon or other graphic that provides information as to the relevant functionality-as
shown in Fig. 6D, in some embodiments, the icon indicates the functionality is a fast
forward functionality. In some embodiments, the icon (e.g., functionality information
622) is displayed at a first location in the user interface (e.g., middle-right of the user
interface), the first location corresponding to a first predefined region (e.g., predefined
region 612) on the touch-sensitive surface associated with the first functionality (e.g., a
first region on the touch-sensitive surface that, when selected, will cause the first
functionality to be performed. For example, the middle-right region of touch-sensitive
surface, e.g., predefined region 612). Thus, in some embodiments, the location of the
functionality icon in the user interface maps to the location of the functionality access on
touch-sensitive surface 451 of the remote. Selection of the functionality is optionally
accomplished as described above. In some embodiments, functionality information 622
optionally provides some visual indication (e.g., glowing, flashing, etc.) that contact 603
is detected in a region of touch-sensitive surface 451 that corresponds to the functionality
information (e.g., predefined region 612). This visual indication optionally provides
feedback to a user that further selection of predefined region 612 (e.g., by clicking in
predefined region 612) will perform the functionality associated with predefined region
612 and functionality information 622.
[00141]          Fig. 6E illustrates exemplary functionality information for two
functionalities displayed in a user interface on display 450. In some embodiments, the
functionality information displayed on display 450 includes information about two or
more functionalities accessible from touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., functionality
information 626, 624, and 628, indicating the accessibility of the rewind functionality
from predefined region 608, the fast forward functionality from predefined region 612,
and the information functionality from predefined region 604, respectively). Further, as

before, each piece of functionality information is optionally displayed at a location in the
user interface that corresponds to the associated predefined region on touch-sensitive
surface 451. The relative positioning of functionality information 626 with respect to
functionality information 624 in the user interface optionally corresponds to the relative
positioning of predefined region 608 with respect to predefined region 612. Selection of
the respective functionalities is optionally accomplished as described above and as
illustrated in Fig. 6E.
[00142]          In some embodiments, as above, the functionalities accessible from the
predefined regions are based on context, as illustrated in Figs. 6F-6G. In some
embodiments, a second predefined region (e.g., region 608) of the plurality of predefined
regions on the touch-sensitive surface of the device is associated with a second set of
functionalities, the second set of functionalities including a second functionality (e.g., the
left-middle region of the touch-sensitive surface is associated with a first functionality,
and the right-middle region of the touch-sensitive surface is associated with a second
functionality). Determining the functionality information for display in response to
receiving the indication of the first input (e.g., a resting finger) further comprises
selecting the second functionality from the second set of functionalities based on the
current context of the user interface (e.g., what kind of content is displayed in the user
interface). In accordance with the determination that the current context is the first
context (e.g., an advertisement displayed in the user interface, illustrated in Fig. 6F), the
first functionality (e.g., functionality 630 in Fig. 6F) corresponds to the first operation
(e.g., skipping the advertisement), and the second functionality (e.g., functionality 632 in
Fig. 6F) corresponds to a third operation (e.g., restarting the advertisement) different from
the first operation and the second operation (e.g., the left-middle region of the touch
sensitive surface restarts the advertisement, and the right-middle region of the touch
sensitive surface skips the advertisement). In accordance with the determination that the
current context is the second context (e.g., a movie displayed in the user interface,
illustrated in Fig. 6G), the first functionality (e.g., functionality 624 in Fig. 6G)
corresponds to the second operation (e.g., fast-forwarding the movie), and the second
functionality (e.g., functionality 626 in Fig. 6G) corresponds to a fourth operation (e.g.,
rewinding the movie) different from the first operation, the second operation, and the
third operation (e.g., the left-middle region of the touch-sensitive surface rewinds the

[00148]         Figs. 7A-7G are flow diagrams illustrating a method 700 of displaying
functionality information in accordance with some embodiments. The method 700 is
optionally performed at an electronic device such as device 500 as described above with
reference to Fig. 5, including a set top box or other user interface generating device that is
in communication with a remote control and a display device. Some operations in
method 700 are, optionally, combined and/or the order of some operations is, optionally,
changed.
[00149]         As described below, the method 700 provides ways in which a device
optionally provides functionality information to a user. The method reduces the cognitive
burden on a user when interacting with a user interface of the device of the disclosure,
thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated
electronic devices, increasing the efficiency of the user's interaction with the user
interface conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.

user interface generating device that is in communication with a remote control and a

display device, such as device 500 in Fig. 5) with one or more processors and memory
generates (702) a user interface for display on a display device (e.g., a television or other
display device, such as display 450 in Fig. 6A).
[00151]         In some embodiments, while the user interface is displayed on the display
device, the device receives (703) an indication of a first input that includes a contact (e.g.,
a finger contact or stylus contact) detected on a touch-sensitive surface of a device (e.g., a
touch-sensitive surface of a remote control or a portable multifunction device with a
touchscreen display, such as contact 601 detected on touch-sensitive surface 451 in Fig.
6A). In some embodiments, the touch-sensitive surface includes a plurality of predefined
regions (e.g., regions 602, 604, 606, 608, 610, 612, 614, 616, and 618 on touch-sensitive
surface 451 in Fig. 6A) and each predefined region of the plurality of predefined regions
is selectable to perform an associated functionality (704) (e.g., each region is selectable to
perform a functionality, including reverse skipping, forward skipping, rewinding, fast
forwarding, scrubbing and displaying information associated with a content item). In
some embodiments, the touch-sensitive surface includes fewer than nine predefined
regions; for example, in some embodiments, the touch-sensitive surface includes four
predefined regions (top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left, and top-left) that are optionally
larger than the nine predefined regions, and in some embodiments, the touch-sensitive
surface includes five predefined regions (top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left, top-left and
center) that are optionally larger than the nine predefined regions, but optionally smaller
than the four predefined regions. In some embodiments, the number of predefined
regions on the touch-sensitive surface is based on the number of functionalities that need
to be accessible from the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., when more functionalities need to
be accessible from the touch-sensitive surface, the touch-sensitive surface optionally
includes more predefined regions). In some embodiments, the device comprises an input
device, and the input device and the display device are separate devices (705) (e.g.,
display 450 and touch-sensitive surface 451 in Fig. 6A are included in separate devices).
[00152]         In some embodiments, the plurality of associated functionalities includes
navigation functionalities for navigating in the user interface (706). In some
embodiments, the plurality of associated functionalities includes navigation
functionalities for navigating content in the user interface (707). In some embodiments,

[00153]         In some embodiments, in response to receiving the indication of the first
input (710) (e.g., contact 601 in Fig. 6A), the device determines (712) whether the contact
has been detected for longer than a first time period (e.g., determines whether a resting
finger has been detected on the touch-sensitive surface of the remote for at least a
threshold amount of time such as 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, or 1 seconds-for example, whether contact
601 in Fig. 6A has been detected for longer than the threshold amount of time). In some
embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the contact meets functionality
display criteria (e.g., one or more criterion) that include a criterion that is met when the
contact has been detected for longer than the first time period, the device determines
(714) functionality information (e.g., determines a respective functionality for which
functionality information is to be displayed, and then selects pre-generated functionality
information that corresponds to the respective functionality, or generates the functionality
information that is to be displayed on the display) for display in the user interface (e.g.,
functionality information 620 in Fig. 6A, functionality information 622 in Fig. 6D, and
functionality information 624 and 626 in Fig. 6E). In some embodiments, the
functionality information includes information about a first functionality of the plurality
of associated functionalities (716) (e.g., resting a finger anywhere on the touch-sensitive
surface brings up information about one or more functionalities accessible from the
touch-sensitive surface). For example, the functionality information optionally includes
one or more icons (e.g., icons 624 and 626 in Fig. 6E) that are displayed in the user
interface that indicate functions accessible from corresponding regions of the touch
sensitive surface. In some embodiments, the functionality information comprises an
overlay displayed over a moving image or a still image in the user interface (718) (e.g.,
functionality information 622 in Fig. 6D is optionally overlaid on a moving or still image
displayed on display 450). In some embodiments, the functionality display criteria
include a criterion that is met when the contact has moved less than a first movement
threshold during the first time period (720) (e.g., in order to display the functionality
information, the contact (e.g., contact 601 in Fig. 6A) optionally must be a substantially
stationary contact). In some embodiments, the information about the first functionality

WO 2015/200537                                                                PCT/US2015/037520
comprises a visual cue for performing the first functionality (722) (e.g., a visual display
about the functionality to be performed, how to perform the functionality from the
remote, etc., such as functionality information 620 in Fig. 6C and functionality
information 624 and 626 in Fig. 6E).
[00154]          In some embodiments, the information about the first functionality is
displayed at a first location in the user interface, the first location corresponding to a first
predefined region on the touch-sensitive surface associated with the first functionality
(724) (e.g., a first predefined region on the touch-sensitive surface that, when activated,
will cause the first functionality to be performed). Thus, in some embodiments, the
location of the functionality icon on the user interface maps to the location of
functionality access on the touch-sensitive surface of the remote. For example, the
location of functionality information 622 on display 450 optionally corresponds to the
location of region 612 on touch-sensitive surface 451 in Fig. 6D. In some embodiments,
the functionality information further includes second information about a second
functionality of the plurality of associated functionalities (726). In some embodiments,
the second information is displayed at a second location in the user interface, the second
location corresponding to a second predefined region on the touch-sensitive surface
associated with the second functionality (728) (e.g., a second region on the touch
sensitive surface that, when activated, will cause the second functionality to be
performed). In some embodiments, a relative positioning of the first location in the user
interface with respect to the second location in the user interface corresponds to a relative
positioning of the first predefined region on the touch-sensitive surface with respect to the
second predefined region on the touch-sensitive surface (730), as illustrated in Fig. 6E
with functionality information 624 and 626 and corresponding regions 612 and 608,
respectively.
[00155]          In some embodiments, a first predefined region of the plurality of
predefined regions on the touch-sensitive surface of the device is associated with a first
set of functionalities, the first set of functionalities including the first functionality (732)
(e.g., the right region of the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., region 612 in Fig. 6A) is
optionally associated with fast-forwarding and skipping an advertisement). In some
embodiments, a second predefined region of the plurality of predefined regions on the
touch-sensitive surface of the device is associated with a second set of functionalities, the
                                                -48-

WO 2015/200537                                                               PCT/US2015/037520
second set of functionalities including a second functionality (734) (e.g., the left region of
the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., region 608 in Fig. 6A) is associated with a first set of
functionalities, and the right region of the touch-sensitive surface is associated with a
second set of functionalities). In some embodiments, determining the functionality
information for display in response to receiving the indication of the first input comprises
(736) determining (738) a current context of the user interface (e.g., determining what
kind of content is displayed in the user interface). In some embodiments, determining the
functionality information for display in response to receiving the indication of the first
input comprises (736) selecting (740) the first functionality from the first set of
functionalities based on the current context of the user interface. In some embodiments,
in accordance with a determination that the current context is a first context (e.g., an
advertisement displayed in the user interface, a collection of music displayed in the user
interface, an application displayed in the user interface, a collection of photos displayed
in the user interface, etc.), the first functionality corresponds to a first operation (742)
(e.g., skipping the advertisement, navigating to a page of the collection of music,
switching to another application, navigating to a page of the collection of photos, etc.). In
some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the current context is a
second context, different from the first context (e.g., a movie displayed in the user
interface, a television channel displayed in the user interface, a content information page
displayed in the user interface, etc.), the first functionality corresponds to a second
operation, different from the first operation (744) (e.g., fast-forwarding the movie,
changing the channel, viewing more content information, etc.). For example, selection of
region 612 in Fig. 6A optionally performs a first operation when the current context is a
first context, and performs a second operation when the current context is a second
context.
[00156]          In some embodiments, determining the functionality information for
display in response to receiving the indication of the first input comprises (736) selecting
(746) the second functionality from the second set of functionalities based on the current
context of the user interface. In some embodiments, in accordance with the determination
that the current context is the first context (e.g., an advertisement displayed in the user
interface), the first functionality corresponds to the first operation (e.g., skipping the
advertisement), and the second functionality corresponds to a third operation (e.g.,
                                                -49-

WO 2015/200537                                                             PCT/US2015/037520
restarting the advertisement) different from the first operation and the second operation
(748) (e.g., the left region of the touch-sensitive surface restarts the advertisement and the
right region of the touch-sensitive surface skips the advertisement). In some
embodiments, in accordance with the determination that the current context is the second
context (e.g., a movie displayed in the user interface), the first functionality corresponds
to the second operation (e.g., fast-forwarding the movie), and the second functionality
corresponds to a fourth operation (e.g., rewinding the movie) different from the first
operation, the second operation, and the third operation (750) (e.g., the left region of the
touch-sensitive surface rewinds the movie and the right region of the touch-sensitive
surface fast-forwards the movie). Thus, the operations performed by the regions on the
touch-sensitive surface are optionally based on the current context of the user interface.
[00157]          In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the contact
does not meet the functionality display criteria (e.g., because the contact has not been
detected for longer than the first time period), the device forgoes (752) determination of
the functionality information including the information about the first functionality of the
plurality of associated functionalities (e.g., icons, such as icons 624 and 626 in Fig. 6E,
indicating the functionalities of the different regions of the touch-sensitive surface are
optionally not displayed if the contact ends before the first time period has been reached).
[00158]          In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the
functionality display criteria has not been met because the contact has moved more than
the first movement threshold during the first time period, the device forgoes (754)
determination of the functionality information including the information about the first
functionality of the plurality of associated functionalities.
[00159]          In some embodiments, the device receives (756) an indication of a second
input detected on a first predefined region of the touch-sensitive surface that is associated
with the first functionality, as illustrated by contacts 601 and 603 in Figs. 6C and 6D. In
some embodiments, detecting the second input comprises detecting the second input
concurrently with the contact on the touch-sensitive surface of the device (758) (e.g., no
liftoff of the contact need be detected before detection of a click in the respective
predefined region of the touch-sensitive surface). In some embodiments, detecting the
second input comprises detecting a second contact (e.g., one or more of a tap, a click and
a resting touch) on the first predefined region of the touch-sensitive surface of the device
                                               -50-

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
(760). In some embodiments, detecting the second input comprises detecting an increase
in an intensity of the contact above a first predetermined intensity threshold (762) (e.g.,
mechanical click or force detection).
[00160]          In some embodiments, in response to receiving the indication of the
second input, the device performs (764) the first functionality associated with the first
predefined region. For example, in response to receiving the indication of contact 601 in
region 612 in Fig. 6C, the device optionally fast forwards content in the user interface.
[00161]          In some embodiments, the device receives (766) an indication of a third
input detected on the first predefined region of the touch-sensitive surface that is
associated with the first functionality. In some embodiments, detecting the third input
comprises detecting a second increase in the intensity of the contact above a second
predetermined intensity threshold (e.g., multi-level click), the second predetermined
intensity threshold being greater than the first predetermined intensity threshold (768). In
some embodiments, in response to receiving the indication of the third input, the device
forgoes (770) performance of the first functionality associated with the first predefined
region on the touch-sensitive surface, and performs a second functionality associated with
the first predefined region of the touch-sensitive surface, the second functionality being
different than the first functionality (e.g., a double-level click performs a different
functionality than single-level click). For example, while a single-level click in region
612 in Fig. 6C optionally performs a fast forward operation, a double-level click in region
612 optionally performs a different operation (e.g., 30s forward skip).
[00162]          In some embodiments, prior to performing the second functionality, the
device replaces (772) the functionality information in the user interface with second
functionality information, the second functionality information including second
information about the second functionality associated with the first predefined region of
the touch-sensitive surface. For example, the device optionally replaces functionality
information 620 in Fig. 6C with functionality information about the different functionality
performed in response to the double-level click.
[00163]          In some embodiments, detecting the second input further comprises
detecting the contact on the touch-sensitive surface of the device for longer than a second
time period after detecting the increase in the intensity of the contact above the first
                                                -51-

WO 2015/200537                                                               PCT/US2015/037520
predetermined intensity threshold (774) (e.g., detecting a click and hold for at least a
threshold amount of time such as 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, or 1 seconds). In some embodiments, in
response to receiving the indication of the second input, the device forgoes (776)
performance of the first functionality associated with the first predefined region on the
touch-sensitive surface, and performs a second functionality associated with the first
predefined region of the touch-sensitive surface, the second functionality being different
than the first functionality (e.g., a click and hold initiates a different functionality than
only a click). For example, while a single-level click in region 612 in Fig. 6C optionally
performs a fast forward operation, a click and hold in region 612 optionally performs a
different operation (e.g., skipping to the next chapter in content).
[00164]          In some embodiments, prior to performing the second functionality, the
device replaces (778) the functionality information in the user interface with second
functionality information, the second functionality information including second
information about the second functionality associated with the first predefined region of
the touch-sensitive surface. For example, the device optionally replaces functionality
information 620 in Fig. 6C with functionality information about the different functionality
performed in response to the click and hold.
[00165]          It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in
Figs. 7A-7G have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate that
the described order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of
ordinary skill in the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations described
herein. Additionally, it should be noted that details of other processes described herein
with respect to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 900, 1100, 1300 and 1500)
are also applicable in an analogous manner to method 700 described above with respect to
Figs. 7A-7G. For example, the user interfaces, display devices ,touch-sensitive surfaces
and contacts described above with reference to method 700 optionally have one or more
of the characteristics of the user interfaces, display devices, touch-sensitive surfaces and
contacts described herein with reference to other methods described herein (e.g., methods
900, 1100, 1300 and 1500). For brevity, these details are not repeated here.
[00166]          The operations in the information processing methods described above are,
optionally, implemented by running one or more functional modules in an information
                                               -52-

WO 2015/200537                                                           PCT/US2015/037520
processing apparatus such as general purpose processors (e.g., as described above with
respect to Figs. 1A, 3 and 5) or application specific chips.
[00167]          The operations described above with reference to Figs. 7A-7G are,
optionally, implemented by components depicted in Figs. lA-lB. For example,
generation operation 702, receiving operation 703, and determination operations 712 and
714 are, optionally, implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event
handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive
display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to
application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the
event information to respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first
contact at a first location on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event
or sub-event, such as selection of an object on a user interface. When a respective
predefined event or sub-event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler
 190 associated with the detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally
utilizes or calls data updater 176 or object updater 177 to update the application internal
state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a respective GUI updater
 178 to update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it would be clear to a
person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be implemented based on
the components depicted in Figs. lA-1B.
                                   Content Navigation Bar
[00168]          Providing a content navigation bar by which a user can easily and
efficiently navigate content displayed in a user interface provided by a device can
enhance the user's interaction with the content and the device. The embodiments
described below provide ways that a device optionally presents such a content navigation
bar in a user interface. Enhancing interactions with a device reduces the amount of time
needed by a user to perform operations, and thus reduces the power usage of the device
and increases battery life for battery-powered devices.
[00169]          Figs. 8A-8G illustrate exemplary ways in which a content navigation bar is
presented in a user interface in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.
The embodiments in these figures are used to illustrate the processes described below,
including the processes described with reference to Figs. 9A-9G.

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
[00170]           Fig. 8A illustrates an exemplary sequence of content items. The content
items in sequence 802 are optionally any content items, such as movies, television shows,
and/or applications. In some embodiments, sequence 802 includes entries representing
content items 1 through N (e.g., entries 804, 806, 808, and 810). Sequence 802 optionally
provides information about the ordering of the content items represented in it. For
example, the fact that the entry for content item 2 806 comes before the entry for content
item 3 808 optionally indicates that content item 2 is before content item 3 in the relevant
sequence or ordering. Additionally or alternatively to the actual ordering of entries 804,
806, 808, and 810 in sequence 802, the entries themselves optionally contain information
about the relative ordering of their corresponding content items in the relevant sequence
or ordering.
[00171]           The sequence or ordering of content items represented by sequence 802
optionally represents content item ordering in many contexts. For example, if the content
items of interest are episodes of a television series, sequence 802 optionally provides the
correct ordering of the episodes based on the content of the episodes (e.g., the first
episode, the second episode, etc.). If the content items of interest are television
broadcasts on a specific channel, for example, sequence 802 optionally provides the
correct ordering of the television broadcasts based on the time that the broadcasts were
aired (e.g., the 7:00pm broadcast, followed by the 7:30 broadcast, followed by the 8:00pm
broadcast, etc.). Sequence 802 optionally provides an ordering of content items in any
context in which ordering of content items is optionally of interest.
[00172]           To facilitate such content type-based sequence determinations, an
electronic device (e.g., device 500 in Fig. 5) optionally determines a content type (e.g.,
movie, television show, etc.) of a content item of interest (the "respective content item").
In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the content type of the
respective content item is a first content type, the electronic device identifies a first
sequence of content items that includes the respective content item, wherein a first
content item immediately precedes the respective content item in the sequence of content
items, and a second content item immediately follows the respective content item in the
sequence of content items (e.g., if the content type of the respective content item is a
television series, the respective content item is optionally an episode of the television
series, the first content item is optionally an immediately previous episode in the
                                               -54-

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
television series, and the second content item is optionally the immediately next episode
in the television series). In accordance with a determination that the content type of the
respective content item is a second content type, the electronic device optionally
identifies a second sequence of content items that includes the respective content item, the
second sequence of content items being different than the first sequence of content items,
wherein a third content item is adjacent to the respective content item in the second
sequence of content items, the third content item being different than the first content
item and the second content item (e.g., if the content type of the respective content item is
a television broadcast, the respective content item is optionally a television program
broadcast during a time slot, the first content item is optionally a television program
broadcast during an immediately previous time slot, and the second content item is
optionally a television program broadcast during an immediately next time slot).
[00173]         Fig. 8B illustrates an exemplary user interface including a navigation bar.
Display 450 optionally displays a user interface that includes region 828 and navigation
bar 830. Region 828 optionally displays a representation of a current position in a
respective content item (e.g., a large version of content being played in the user interface).
The respective content item is optionally a currently selected content item (e.g., a content
item selected for presentation to the user on display 450) from a sequence of content
items that includes a plurality of content items (e.g., movies, television shows,
applications), such as sequence 802.
[00174]         In some embodiments, navigation bar 830 includes a plurality of images
814, 816, 818, 820, and 822 that correspond to different positions in the respective
content item, the representation of the current position in which is displayed in region
828. For example, navigation bar 830 optionally includes images from different points in
time (e.g., every 5 seconds or minutes) in the first episode of a television series (the
respective content item).
[00175]         In some embodiments, the representation of the respective content item in
region 828 of the user interface is larger than navigation bar 830 in the user interface
(e.g., the video of the respective content item is larger than the images in the navigation
bar). In some embodiments, the representation of the respective content item in region
828 comprises video from the respective content item, the video including the plurality of
images 814, 816, 818, 820, and 822, in navigation bar 830. In some embodiments, the

WO 2015/200537                                                             PCT/US2015/037520
plurality of images 814, 816, 818, 820, and 822, in navigation bar 830 comprise a
plurality of still images from the respective content item.
[00176]          In some embodiments, navigation bar 830 also includes a representation of
a first adjacent content item 824 in the plurality of content items that is adjacent to the
respective content item in the sequence (e.g., sequence 802) of content items. For
example, navigation bar 830 optionally includes a representation of the second episode
(e.g., next episode) in a television series (the first adjacent content item 824) when the
respective content item is an episode in the television series. It is understood that
navigation bar 830 could additionally or alternatively include a representation of a
previous episode in the television series, for example.
[00177]          As shown in Fig. 8B, in some embodiments, navigation bar 830 includes
representations of two adjacent content items 812 and 824 (e.g., a previous and a next
content item). In some embodiments, navigation bar 830 optionally includes a
representation of a second adjacent content item 812 (e.g., a previous content item) in the
plurality of content items that is adjacent to the respective content item in the sequence of
content items. As described above, the first adjacent content item optionally precedes the
respective content item in the sequence of content items (e.g., the first adjacent content
item is an episode previous to the current episode in a television series, or a television
program broadcast during a time slot previous to the current television program), and the
second adjacent content item optionally follows the respective content item in the
sequence of content items (e.g., the second adjacent content item is an episode following
the current episode in a television series, or a television program broadcast during a time
slot following the current television program).
[00178]          As discussed above with respect to Fig. 8A, in some embodiments, the
first and second adjacent content items are based on a determined content type of the
respective content item. For example, as shown in Figs. 8B-8C, in some embodiments,
when the content type of the respective content item is a television broadcast (e.g.,
8:00PM television broadcast in Fig. 8B), the previous adjacent content item is optionally
a television broadcast during a previous time slot (e.g., 7:30PM television broadcast in
Fig. 8B), and the next adjacent content item is optionally a television broadcast during a
next time slot (e.g., 8:30PM television broadcast in Fig. 8B). In some embodiments,
when the content type of the respective content item is an episode of a television series

(e.g., episode 2 of a television series in Fig. 8C), the previous adjacent content item is
optionally a previous episode of the television series (e.g., episode 1 of the television
series in Fig. 8C), and the next adjacent content item is optionally a next episode of the
television series (e.g., episode 3 of the television series in Fig. 8C).
[00179]          In some embodiments, the representations of the first adjacent content item
824 and/or the second adjacent content item 812 in navigation bar 830 comprise images
from positions in the first and/or second adjacent content item (e.g., one or more
screenshots from points in time in the next and/or previous episodes in the television
series).
[00180]          In some embodiments, a user optionally provides input to change the time
interval between positions in the respective content item to which images 814, 816, 818,
820, and 822, correspond. In other words, the user optionally provides input to change
the time interval between images 814, 816, 818, 820, and 822, displayed in navigation bar
830, so that instead of the images corresponding to points in time separated by 5 minutes
in the respective content item, for example, the images optionally correspond to points in
time separated by 10 minutes in the respective content item, for example.
[00181]          Thus, in some embodiments, a first image of the plurality of images (e.g.,
image 814) in navigation bar 830 corresponds to a first position in the respective content
item, and a second image of the plurality of images (e.g., image 816) in the navigation bar
corresponds to a second position in the respective content item, the first position in the
respective content item and the second position in the respective content item being
separated by a first interval (e.g., an amount of time, for example, 5 or 10 minutes). In
some embodiments, while the user interface is displayed on display 450, the electronic
device receives an indication of a first input that includes a contact (e.g., a finger contact
or stylus contact) detected on a touch-sensitive surface of a device (e.g., a touch-sensitive
surface of a remote control or a portable multifunction device with a touchscreen display),
wherein detecting the contact comprises detecting a movement of the contact (e.g., a
vertical swipe on the touch-sensitive surface). In accordance with the movement of the
contact, the electronic device optionally selects a third position and a fourth position in
the respective content item, and their corresponding third image and fourth image,
respectively, the third position and fourth position being separated by a second interval
that is different than the first interval (e.g., larger or smaller than the first interval), and
                                                 -57-

replaces the first image (e.g., image 814) in navigation bar 830 with a third image
corresponding to the third position in the respective content item, and the second image
(e.g., image 816) in the navigation bar with a fourth image corresponding to the fourth
position in the respective content item. In this way, the electronic device optionally
changes the time interval between the images in navigation bar 830.
[00182]         In some embodiments, changing the time interval between positions in the
respective content item to which images 814, 816, 818, 820, and 822, correspond is based
on the content type of the respective content item, similar to as described with reference
to Figs. 8D-8E below (e.g., the type of content that is being displayed in region 828 of the
user interface). In some embodiments, the electronic device optionally determines a
content type (e.g., movie, television show, etc.) of the respective content item. In
accordance with a determination that the content type of the respective content item is a
first content type (e.g., a sporting event), the electronic device optionally selects the
second interval separating the third position and fourth position in the respective content
item to be a time-based interval (e.g., separated by 5, 10, or 20 minutes). In accordance
with a determination that the content type of the respective content item is a second
content type (e.g., a movie), the electronic device optionally selects the second interval
separating the third position and fourth position in the respective content item to be a
content-based interval (e.g., separated by an amount of time based on the content of the
respective content item, for example, scenes, chapters, and/or beginnings/ends of
commercials).
[00183]         In some embodiments, navigation bar 830 further includes current position
indicator 826 overlaid on the plurality of images 814, 816, 818, 820, and 822, in the
navigation bar (e.g., an indicator such as a line that moves over and between the images
in the navigation bar). A relative location of current position indicator 826 with respect to
each of the plurality of images in navigation bar 830 optionally corresponds to the current
position in the respective content item (e.g., if the current position indicator is before an
image in the navigation bar, the current position in the respective content item is before
the position corresponding to the image). In some embodiments, the relative location of
current position indicator 826 with respect to each of the plurality of images in navigation
bar 830 additionally or alternatively corresponds to the representation of the current
position in the respective content item displayed in region 828 of the user interface (e.g.,
                                               -58-

WO 2015/200537                                                              PCT/US2015/037520
the representation of the current position in the respective content item displayed in
region 828 of the user interface shows content from the current position of the respective
content item).
[00184]          In some embodiments, the electronic device optionally scrolls (or
"scrubs") through the respective content item in response to input detected on a touch
sensitive surface of a device (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface of a remote control or a
portable multifunction device with a touchscreen display). In some embodiments, while
the user interface is displayed on display 450, the electronic device receives an indication
of a first input that includes a contact (e.g., a finger contact or stylus contact) detected on
a touch-sensitive surface of a device (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface of a remote control or
a portable multifunction device with a touchscreen display). Detecting the contact
optionally comprises detecting a movement of the contact (e.g., the first input is
optionally a gesture input, such as a horizontal swipe on the touch-sensitive surface). The
electronic device optionally moves current position indicator 826 in navigation bar 830 in
accordance with the movement of the contact (e.g., if the first input is a swipe to the right,
the current position indicator is moved to the right in the navigation bar). Moving current
position indicator 826 optionally comprises changing the relative location of the current
position indicator with respect to each image of the plurality of images 814, 816, 818,
820, and 822, in navigation bar 830 in accordance with the movement of the contact (e.g.,
moving the current position indicator over and through the plurality of images in the
navigation bar as the plurality of images remain stationary), and updating the current
position in the respective content item and the representation of the current position in the
respective content item (e.g., the representation displayed in region 828 of the user
interface) in accordance with the relative location of the current position indicator with
respect to each image of the plurality of images (e.g., scrubbing through the respective
content item based on the location of the current position indicator, including updating the
video and/or image(s) of the respective content item displayed in region 828 of the user
interface).
[00185]          As shown in Figs. 8D-8E, in some embodiments, the time interval between
the positions in the respective content item to which the plurality of images 814, 816, 818,
820, and 822, in navigation bar 830 correspond is based on a content type (e.g., movie,
television show, sporting event, etc.) of the respective content item. In some
                                                -59-

WO 2015/200537                                                             PCT/US2015/037520
embodiments, the electronic device determines a content type (e.g., movie, television
show, etc.) of the respective content item. In accordance with a determination that the
content type of the respective content item is a first content type (e.g., a broadcast of a
sporting event, such as the television broadcast in Fig. 8D), the electronic device
optionally selects a first position and a second position in the respective content item, the
first position and the second position being separated by a first interval (e.g., an amount
of time). In some embodiments, the first interval is a time-based interval (e.g., the images
814, 816, 818, 820, and 822, in navigation bar 830 are images from the respective content
item, the positions of which in the respective content item are separated by 5, 10, or 20
minute intervals, for example, as shown in Fig. 8D), a first image of the plurality of
images (e.g., image 814) in the navigation bar corresponds to the first position in the
respective content item, and a second image of the plurality of images (e.g., image 816) in
the navigation bar corresponds to the second position in the respective content item.
[00186]          In accordance with a determination that the content type of the respective
content item is a second content type (e.g., a movie, such as the movie in Fig. 8E), the
electronic device optionally selects a third position and a fourth position in the respective
content item, the third position and the fourth position being separated by a second
interval (e.g., an amount of time), different from the first interval discussed above. In
some embodiments, the second interval is a content-based interval (e.g., the images 814,
816, 818, 820, and 822, in navigation bar 830 are images from the respective content
item, the positions of which in the respective content item are separated by content-based
intervals, such as scenes in a movie, chapters in a movie, and/or beginnings/ends of
commercials, as shown in Fig. 8E), the first image of the plurality of images (e.g., image
814) in the navigation bar corresponds to the third position in the respective content item,
and the second image of the plurality of images (e.g., image 816) in the navigation bar
corresponds to the fourth position in the respective content item.
[00187]          Fig. 8F illustrates an exemplary operation for scrolling into the adjacent
content item in the navigation bar. As described above, the electronic device optionally
scrolls through navigation bar 830, and the corresponding respective content item, in
response to input detected on touch-sensitive surface 451. For example, the input
optionally includes contact 801, and movement of the contact, as illustrated. In the
                                              -60-

WO 2015/200537                                                           PCT/US2015/037520
illustrated example, the input is a horizontal swipe input, though the scope of the
disclosure is not so limited.
[00188]         Eventually, scrolling through navigation bar 830 optionally results in
reaching the end of the respective content item, and thus current position indicator 826
optionally reaches the end of the portion of the navigation bar that includes images 814,
816, 818, 820, and 822, from the respective content item. If further scrolling input is
detected on touch-sensitive surface 451, current position indicator 826 optionally crosses
over into the portion of navigation bar 830 that includes the representation of the adjacent
content item 824. In response, scrolling optionally continues through the content item
corresponding to the representation of the adjacent content tem 824, as described below.
Thus, the navigation bar of this disclosure allows a user to scroll through a current content
item, and also scroll into one or more content items that are adjacent to the current
content item (e.g., previous/next television episodes).
[00189]         To facilitate the above scrolling, in some embodiments, a threshold
separates the plurality of images 814, 816, 818, 820, and 822, in navigation bar 830 from
the representation of the first adjacent content item 824 in the navigation bar (e.g., a line
or other visual indication of a separation between the plurality of images and the
representation of the first adjacent content item). The electronic device optionally
determines that current position indicator 826 has crossed over the threshold from the
plurality of images 814, 816, 818, 820, and 822, in navigation bar 830 to the
representation of the first adjacent content item 824 in the navigation bar (e.g., the current
position indicator has moved all the way through the plurality of images, and into the
portion of the navigation bar including the representation of the first adjacent content
item).
[00190]         Fig. 8G illustrates an exemplary operation that results from scrolling into
the adjacent content item in the navigation bar. When current position indicator 826 has
crossed over into the representation of adjacent content item 824, as described above,
navigation bar 830 is optionally reconstituted to reflect that the adjacent content item has
now become the current content item.
[00191]         To accomplish this reconstitution, in some embodiments, in accordance
with the determination that current position indicator 826 has crossed over the threshold
                                              -61-

WO 2015/200537                                                             PCT/US2015/037520
from the plurality of images 814, 816, 818, 820, and 822, in navigation bar 830 to the
representation of the first adjacent content item 824 in the navigation bar, the electronic
device replaces, in the navigation bar, the plurality of images corresponding to different
positions in the respective content item (images 814, 816, 818, 820, and 822 in Fig. 8F)
with a second plurality of images (image 834, 836, 838, 840, and 842 in Fig. 8G)
corresponding to different positions in the first adjacent content item (e.g., the first
adjacent content item now becomes the "currently selected" content item, images from
which populate the navigation bar). The electronic device optionally sets the relative
location of current position indicator 826 with respect to each image of the second
plurality of images 834, 836, 838, 840, and 842, in navigation bar 830 to correspond to a
current position in the first adjacent content item (e.g., the electronic device repositions
the current position indicator to the beginning, as shown in Fig. 8G, or end of the first
adjacent content item, depending on whether the current position indicator has been
scrolled into the previous content item or the next content item).
[00192]         In some embodiments, the electronic device replaces, in navigation bar
830, the representation of the first adjacent content item 824 (in Fig. 8F) with a
representation of a second adjacent content item 844 (in Fig. 8G) in the plurality of
content items-because what used to be the first adjacent content item has become the
current content item, the electronic device optionally needs to determine a content item
that is adjacent to the first adjacent content item, different from the respective content
item. In other words, the electronic device optionally determines a next content item
(e.g., the second adjacent content item) with respect to the first adjacent content item 824
in Fig. 8F.
[00193]         In some embodiments, the second adjacent content item (e.g., the content
item that is adjacent to the first adjacent content item) is different than the respective
content item, and the second adjacent content item is adjacent to the first adjacent content
item in the sequence of content items.
[00194]         The electronic device optionally replaces, in the user interface, the
representation of the current position of the respective content item, which was displayed
in region 828 of the user interface, with a representation of the current position in the first
adjacent content item in region 828 of the user interface (e.g., the electronic device
optionally updates the user interface to display an image/video from the current position
                                              -62-

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
in the first adjacent content item instead of an image/video from the original, respective
content item). In this way, the electronic device facilitates scrolling from one content
item to an adjacent content item. Though the discussion above has focused on scrolling
into a next content item, the operations disclosed above similarly apply to scrolling into a
previous content item, the details of which are omitted here for brevity.
[00195]          Figs. 9A-9G are flow diagrams illustrating a method 900 of presenting a
content navigation bar in accordance with some embodiments. The method 900 is
optionally performed at an electronic device such as device 500 as described above with
reference to Fig. 5, including a set top box or other user interface generating device that is
in communication with a remote control and a display device. Some operations in
method 900 are, optionally, combined and/or the order of some operations is, optionally,
changed.
[00196]          As described below, the method 900 provides ways in which a device
optionally presents a content navigation bar in a user interface. The method reduces the
cognitive burden on a user when interacting with a user interface on the device, thereby
creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated electronic
devices, increasing the efficiency of the user's interaction with the user interface
conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.
[00197]          In some embodiments, an electronic device (e.g., a set top box or other
user interface generating device that is in communication with a remote control and a
display device, such as device 500 in Fig. 5) with one or more processors and memory
obtains (902) information that identifies a sequence of content items that includes a
plurality of content items (e.g., movies, television shows, applications, etc.). For
example, the electronic device optionally obtains information that identifies sequence 802
of N content items in Fig. 8A. In some embodiments, obtaining the information that
identifies the sequence of content items including a respective content item comprises
(904) determining (906) a content type (e.g., movie, television show, etc.) of the
respective content item. In some embodiments, obtaining the information that identifies
the sequence of content items including a respective content item comprises (904), in
accordance with a determination that the content type of the respective content item is a
first content type, identifying (908) a first sequence of content items that includes the
respective content item. (e.g., the respective content item is optionally content item 2 806
                                               -63-

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
in Fig. 8A) In some embodiments, a first content item immediately precedes the
respective content item in the sequence of content items (910) (e.g., the first content item
is optionally content item 1 804 in Fig. 8A). In some embodiments, a second content
item immediately follows the respective content item in the sequence of content items
(912) (e.g., the second content item is optionally content item 3 808 in Fig. 8A). For
example, if the content type of the respective content item is a television series, the
respective content item is optionally an episode of the television series, the first content
item is optionally an immediately previous episode in the television series, and the second
content item is optionally an immediately next episode in the television series.
[00198]          In some embodiments, obtaining the information that identifies the
sequence of content items including a respective content item comprises (904), in
accordance with a determination that the content type of the respective content item is a
second content type, identifying (914) a second sequence of content items that includes
the respective content item, the second sequence of content items being different than the
first sequence of content items. In some embodiments, a third content item is adjacent to
the respective content item in the second sequence of content items, the third content item
being different than the first content item and the second content item (916). For
example, if the content type of the respective content item is a television broadcast, the
respective content item is optionally a television program broadcast during a time slot, the
first content item is optionally a television program broadcast during an immediately
previous time slot, and the second content item is optionally a television program
broadcast during an immediately next time slot.
[00199]          In some embodiments, while a respective content item from the plurality
of content items is a currently selected content item (e.g., a content item selected for
presentation to the user on a display device), the device generates (918) a user interface
for display on a display device. In some embodiments, the user interface includes (920) a
representation of a current position in the respective content item (922) (e.g., a large
version of the playing content). This representation of the current position in the
respective content item is optionally provided in, for example, region 828 of the user
interface in Fig. 8B.
[00200]          In some embodiments, the user interface includes (920) a navigation bar
(e.g., navigation bar 830 in Fig. 8B) that includes a plurality of images (e.g., images 814,

816, 818, 812, and 822 in Fig. 8B) corresponding to different positions in the respective
content item and a representation of a first adjacent content item (e.g., representation 812
or 824 in Fig. 8B) in the plurality of content items that is adjacent to the respective
content item in the sequence of content items (924) (e.g., the navigation bar includes
images from the second episode in a television series (the respective content item) and a
representation of the first episode in the television series (the first adjacent content item)).
In some embodiments, the representation of the first adjacent content item in the
navigation bar comprises an image from a position in the first adjacent content item (926)
(e.g., representation 824 in Fig. 8B comprises a screenshot from the previous episode in a
television series). In some embodiments, the navigation bar further includes a
representation of a second adjacent content item (e.g., the next content item) in the
plurality of content items that is adjacent to the respective content item in the sequence of
content items (e.g., the navigation bar includes representations of a previous and a next
content item, such as representations 812 and 824 in Fig. 8B), the first adjacent content
item precedes the respective content item in the sequence of content items (e.g., the first
adjacent content item is an episode previous to the current episode in a television series,
or a television program broadcast during a time slot previous to the current television
program), and the second adjacent content item follows the respective content item in the
sequence of content items (928) (e.g., the second adjacent content item is an episode
following the current episode in a television series, or a television program broadcast
during a time slot following the current television program).
[00201]          In some embodiments, the navigation bar further includes a current
position indicator overlaid on the plurality of images (e.g., current position indicator 826)
in the navigation bar (e.g., a line that moves over and between the images), and a relative
location of the current position indicator with respect to each of the plurality of images in
the navigation bar corresponds to (930) the current position in the respective content item
(932) (e.g., if the current position indicator is before an image in the navigation bar, the
current position in the respective content item is before the position corresponding to the
image), and the representation of the current position in the respective content item (934)
(e.g., the representation of the current position in the respective content item shows
content from the current position).

[00202]           In some embodiments, the representation of the respective content item is
larger than the navigation bar in the user interface (936) (e.g., the video of the respective
content item is relatively large (shown in region 828 in Fig. 8B), while the images in the
navigation bar (images 814, 816, 818, 820, and 822 in Fig. 8B) are relatively small). In
some embodiments, the representation of the respective content item comprises video
from the respective content item, the video including the plurality of images in the
navigation bar (938). In some embodiments, the plurality of images in the navigation bar
comprise a plurality of still images from the respective content item (940).
[00203]           In some embodiments, generating the user interface for display on the
display device comprises (942) determining (944) a content type (e.g., movie, television
show, etc.) of the respective content item.
[00204]           In some embodiments, generating the user interface for display on the
display device comprises (942), in accordance with a determination that the content type
of the respective content item is a first content type, selecting (946) a first position and a
second position in the respective content item, the first position and the second position
being separated by a first interval (e.g., an amount of time). In some embodiments, the
first interval is a time-based interval (948) (e.g., the images in the navigation bar (e.g.,
images 814, 816, 818, 820, and 822 in Fig. 8B) are images from the respective content
item, the positions of which in the respective content item are separated by 5, 10, or 20
minute intervals, for example). In some embodiments, a first image of the plurality of
images in the navigation bar corresponds to the first position in the respective content
item (950) (e.g., image 814 in Fig. 8B optionally corresponds to the first position in the
respective content item). In some embodiments, a second image of the plurality of
images in the navigation bar corresponds to the second position in the respective content
item (952) (e.g., image 816 in Fig. 8B optionally corresponds to the first position in the
respective content item).

of the respective content item is a second content type, selecting (954) a third position and
a fourth position in the respective content item, the third position and the fourth position
being separated by a second interval, different from the first interval. In some

navigation bar (e.g., images 814, 816, 818, 820, and 822 in Fig. 8B) are images from the
respective content item, the positions of which in the respective content item are
separated by content-based intervals, such as scenes, chapters, and/or beginnings/ends of
commercials). In some embodiments, the first image of the plurality of images in the
navigation bar corresponds to the third position in the respective content item (958). In
some embodiments, the second image of the plurality of images in the navigation bar
corresponds to the fourth position in the respective content item (960). In some
embodiments, after generating the user interface for display on the display device, the
device provides (962) the user interface to the display device.
[00206]         In some embodiments, while the user interface is displayed on the display
device, the device receives (964) an indication of a first input that includes a contact (e.g.,
a finger contact or stylus contact) detected on a touch-sensitive surface of a device (e.g., a
touch-sensitive surface of a remote control or a portable multifunction device with a
touchscreen display). In some embodiments, the device comprises an input device, and
the input device and the display device are separate devices (966). In some embodiments,
detecting the contact comprises detecting a movement of the contact (968) (e.g., the first
input is a gesture input, such as a horizontal swipe on the touch-sensitive surface, such as
the movement of contact 801 as illustrated in Fig. 8F). In some embodiments, the device
moves (970) the current position indicator in the navigation bar in accordance with the
movement of the contact (e.g., if the first input is a swipe to the right, the current position
indicator is moved to the right in the navigation bar, as is illustrated in Fig. 8F).
[00207]         In some embodiments, moving the current position indicator comprises
(972) changing (974) the relative location of the current position indicator with respect to
each image of the plurality of images in the navigation bar in accordance with the
movement of the contact (e.g., moving the current position indicator over and through the
plurality of images in the navigation bar as the plurality of images remain stationary). In
some embodiments, moving the current position indicator comprises (972) updating (976)
the current position in the respective content item and the representation of the current
position in the respective content item in accordance with the relative location of the
current position indicator with respect to each image of the plurality of images (e.g.,
scrubbing through the respective content item based on the location of the current

position indicator, including updating the video and/or image of the respective content
item displayed in the user interface in region 828 in Fig. 8F, for example).
[00208]          In some embodiments, a threshold separates the plurality of images in the
navigation bar from the representation of the first adjacent content item in the navigation
bar (978) (e.g., a line or other visual indication of a separation between the plurality of
images and the representation of the first adjacent content item, as is illustrated in Fig.
8F). In some embodiments, the device determines (980) that the current position
indicator has crossed over the threshold from the plurality of images in the navigation bar
to the representation of the first adjacent content item in the navigation bar (e.g., the
current position indicator has moved all the way through the plurality of images, and onto
the representation of the first adjacent content item, as is illustrated in Fig. 8F).
[00209]          In some embodiments, in accordance with the determination (982) that the
current position indicator has crossed over the threshold, the device replaces (984), in the
navigation bar, the plurality of images corresponding to different positions in the
respective content item with a second plurality of images corresponding to different
positions in the first adjacent content item (e.g., the first adjacent content item now
becomes the "currently selected" content item, images from which populate the
navigation bar). For example, after current position indicator 826 in Fig. 8F has crossed
over the threshold to representation 824, images 814, 816, 818, 820, and 822 are
optionally replaced by images from different positions in the content item associated with
representation 824, as is illustrated in Fig. 8G. Now, representation 832 is optionally
associated with the respective content item, and images 834, 836, 838, 840, and 842 are
optionally associated with the first adjacent content item. In some embodiments, the
device sets (986) the relative location of the current position indicator with respect to each
image of the second plurality of images in the navigation bar to correspond to a current
position in the first adjacent content item (e.g., the device repositions the current position
indicator to the beginning or end, as is appropriate, of the first adjacent content item, as
illustrated in Fig. 8G).
[00210]          In some embodiments, the device replaces (988), in the navigation bar, the
representation of the first adjacent content item with a representation of a second adjacent
content item in the plurality of content items (e.g., now, the device determines a content
item that is adjacent to the first adjacent content item, different from the respective
                                               -68-

WO 2015/200537                                                                PCT/US2015/037520
content item, and places a representation of the second adjacent content item in the
navigation bar as representation 844 in Fig. 8G, for example). In some embodiments, the
second adjacent content item is different than the respective content item (990). In some
embodiments, the second adjacent content item is adjacent to the first adjacent content
item in the sequence of content items (992).
[00211]          In some embodiments, the device replaces (994), in the user interface, the
representation of the current position of the respective content item with a representation
of the current position in the first adjacent content item (e.g., the device updates the user
interface to display, in region 828 in Fig. 8G, for example, an image from the current
position in the first adjacent content item instead of an image from the respective content
item).
[00212]          In some embodiments, a first image of the plurality of images in the
navigation bar corresponds to a first position in the respective content item (996). In
some embodiments, a second image of the plurality of images in the navigation bar
corresponds to a second position in the respective content item, the first position in the
respective content item and the second position in the respective content item being
separated by a first interval (998) (e.g., an amount of time, for example, 5 or 10 minutes).
[00213]          In some embodiments, while the user interface is displayed on the display
device, the device receives (998-1) an indication of a first input that includes a contact
detected on a touch-sensitive surface of a device, wherein detecting the contact comprises
detecting a movement of the contact (e.g., a vertical swipe on the touch-sensitive surface).
[00214]          In some embodiments, in accordance with the movement of the contact,
the device selects (998-2) a third position and a fourth position in the respective content
item, the third position and fourth position being separated by a second interval that is
different than the first interval (e.g., larger or smaller than the first interval). In some
embodiments, selecting the third position and the fourth position in the respective content
item comprises (998-3) determining (998-4) a content type (e.g., movie, television show,
etc.) of the respective content item. In some embodiments, selecting the third position
and the fourth position in the respective content item comprises (998-3) in accordance
with a determination that the content type of the respective content item is a first content
type, selecting (998-5) the second interval separating the third position and fourth

position in the respective content item to be a time-based interval (e.g., separated by 5,
 10, or 20 minutes). In some embodiments, selecting the third position and the fourth
position in the respective content item comprises (998-3), in accordance with a
determination that the content type of the respective content item is a second content type,
selecting (998-6) the second interval separating the third position and fourth position in
the respective content item to be a content-based interval (e.g., separated by an amount of
time based on the content of the respective content item, for example, scenes, chapters,
and/or beginnings/ends of commercials).
[00215]         In some embodiments, the device replaces (998-8) the first image in the
navigation bar with the third image, and the second image in the navigation bar with the
fourth image.
[00216]         It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in
Figs. 9A-9G have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate that
the described order is the only order in which the operations could be performed. One of
ordinary skill in the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations described
herein. Additionally, it should be noted that details of other processes described herein
with respect to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 700, 1100, 1300 and 1500)
are also applicable in an analogous manner to method 900 described above with respect to
Figs. 9A-9G. For example, the user interface, display device and content items described
above with reference to method 900 optionally have one or more of the characteristics of
the user interfaces, display devices and content items described herein with reference to
other methods described herein (e.g., methods 700, 1100, 1300 and 1500). For brevity,
these details are not repeated here.
[00217]         The operations in the information processing methods described above are,
optionally, implemented by running one or more functional modules in an information
processing apparatus such as general purpose processors (e.g., as described above with
respect to Figs. 1A, 3 and 5) or application specific chips.
[00218]         The operations described above with reference to Figs. 9A-9G are,
optionally, implemented by components depicted in Figs. lA-lB. For example, obtaining
operation 902, generation operation 918, and providing operation 962 are, optionally,
implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event handler 190. Event

monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive display 112, and
event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to application 136-1. A
respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event information to
respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a first location
on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as
selection of an object on a user interface. When a respective predefined event or sub
event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the
detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally utilizes or calls data
updater 176 or object updater 177 to update the application internal state 192. In some
embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to update what is
displayed by the application. Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary
skill in the art how other processes can be implemented based on the components
depicted in Figs. lA-lB.
                          Predefined Movement in a User Interface
[00219]           When interacting with a user interface presented by an electronic device, a
user can sometimes mean to move a cursor, for example, by a certain amount in the user
interface, but can accidentally move the cursor less or more than that due to imprecision
in the user's input on a touch-sensitive surface, for example. Thus, it can be beneficial
for the electronic device to provide for mechanisms for moving a cursor in a user
interface by a predefined amount (e.g., by a single element in the user interface) in
response to certain inputs detected on an input device (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface) to
enhance the user's experience with the device. The embodiments described below
provide ways to allow for such cursor movement. Enhancing interactions with a device
reduces the amount of time needed by a user to perform operations, and thus reduces the
power usage of the device and increases battery life for battery-powered devices.
[00220]           Figs. 1OA-10D illustrate exemplary ways in which an electronic device
moves a cursor in a user interface by a predefined amount in accordance with some
embodiments of the disclosure. The embodiments in these figures are used to illustrate
the processes described below, including the processes described with reference to Figs.
 11A-1ID.

WO 2015/200537                                                           PCT/US2015/037520
[00221]         Fig. 1OA illustrates an exemplary user interface. Display 450 optionally
displays a user interface that includes various user interface elements 1002, 1004, and
 1006. The user interface also optionally includes selection-indicator 1008, which
provides an indication of a currently selected user interface element (e.g., element 1002)
of the plurality of user interface elements (e.g., elements 1002, 1004, and 1006).
Selection-indicator 1008, though illustrated as a visually distinct object in the user
interface, is optionally anything that provides an indication of a currently selected user
interface element, such as a glow around the currently selected user interface element, a
highlight around the currently selected user interface element, or an outline around the
currently selected user interface element.
[00222]         As discussed above, in some circumstances, a user wishes to move
selection-indicator 1008 from element 1002 to another element (e.g., element 1004). To
do so, the user optionally provides input on touch-sensitive surface 451, as will be
described below.
[00223]         Fig. 10B illustrates exemplary movement of selection-indicator 1008 in
response to input detected on touch-sensitive surface 451. Movement of selection
indicator 1008 is optionally performed in response to an input that includes contact 1001
being detected on touch-sensitive surface 451. As shown in Fig. 10B, in some
embodiments, the input detected on touch-sensitive surface 451 is a horizontal swipe.
The input optionally corresponds to a respective value for a movement metric-a metric
expressing how much selection-indicator 1008 in the user interface should move based on
how much contact 1001 detected on touch-sensitive surface 451 moves. In some
embodiments, the movement metric is optionally a metric based on a relationship of
contact 1001 movement to selection-indicator 1008 movement. As shown in Fig. 10B, in
some embodiments, the movement of contact 1001 detected on touch-sensitive surface
451 corresponds to a movement metric for moving selection-indicator 1008 by the
amount illustrated (e.g., to a position in user interface between elements 1004 and 1006).
[00224]         However, in some cases, the input detected on touch-sensitive surface 451
was optionally intended to move selection-indicator 1008 by an amount other than the
amount specified by the movement metric (such as by a single user interface element
from element 1002 to element 1004, for example). To address such cases, electronic
device optionally provides for the ability to move selection-indicator 1008 by a
                                              -72-

WO 2015/200537                                                             PCT/US2015/037520
predefined amount (e.g., by a single user interface element) in response to detecting
specified inputs and/or gestures.
[00225]         Fig. 1OC illustrates an exemplary scheme for moving selection-indicator
 1008 by a predefined amount in response to detecting an input on touch-sensitive surface
451. The input detected on touch-sensitive surface 451 is optionally the same input as
described in in Fig. 1OB; however in this case, selection-indicator 1008 optionally moves
by a predefined amount (e.g., from element 1002 to element 1004) in response to the
detection of the input. In some embodiments, as illustrated, moving selection-indicator
 1008 by the predefined amount in the user interface comprises moving the selection
indicator to indicate selection of an adjacent user interface element (e.g., element 1004) in
the plurality of user interface elements (e.g., elements 1002, 1004, and 1006).
[00226]         To facilitate such predefined movement of selection-indicator 1008, in
response to receiving the indication of the first input (e.g., the input detected on touch
sensitive surface 451), the electronic device optionally determines whether the first input
meets unitary-movement criteria (e.g., criteria that, when met, cause the selection
indicator in the user interface to move by a predefined amount, such as by a single user
interface element). In accordance with a determination that the first input meets the
unitary-movement criteria, the electronic device optionally moves selection-indicator
 1008 by a predefined amount in the user interface (e.g., a predefined amount not based on
the respective value for the selection-indicator movement metric. In some embodiments,
the respective value for the movement metric is optionally less than a value that would
cause the selection-indicator in the user interface to be moved by the predefined amount,
or greater than a value that would cause the selection-indicator in the user interface to be
moved by the predefined amount). In accordance with a determination that the first input
does not meet the unitary-movement criteria, the electronic device optionally moves
selection-indicator 1008 in accordance with the respective value of the movement metric
associated with the first input (e.g., the electronic device moves the selection-indicator in
the user interface by an amount defined by the magnitude of the movement of the contact
on the touch-sensitive surface, as described with reference to Fig. 10B. In some
embodiments, this is optionally greater than the predefined amount that the selection
indicator would move if the first input met the unitary movement criteria, or less than the
                                               -73-

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
predefined amount that the selection-indicator would move if the first input met the
unitary movement criteria).
[00227]         In some embodiments, movement of selection-indicator 1008 by a
predefined amount occurs when the input detected on touch-sensitive surface 451 is a
"quick swipe"-type input. In other words, in some embodiments, the unitary-movement
criteria include a criterion that is met when liftoff of contact 1001 is detected within a first
time period (e.g., .2, .4, or 1 seconds) of touchdown of the contact, and movement of the
contact is greater than a first movement threshold (e.g., .1, .2 or .5 cm) but less than a
second movement threshold (e.g., 1 or 2 cm). In some embodiments, the first movement
threshold and the second movement threshold are defined in terms of contact movement
needed on touch-sensitive surface 451 to move selection-indicator 1008 by a single UT
element in the user interface (e.g., if 1 cm of movement of the contact on the touch
sensitive surface is needed to move the selection-indicator from a first UI element to a
second UI element that is adjacent to the first UI element, the first movement threshold is
optionally a first percentage of 1 cm (e.g., 10% of 1 cm), and the second movement
threshold is optionally a second percentage of 1 cm (e.g., 100% of 1 cm)).
[00228]         In some embodiments, moving selection-indicator 1008 by the predefined
amount, and moving the selection-indicator in accordance with the respective value of the
movement metric, both comprise moving the selection-indicator in accordance with a
direction of a movement of contact 1001 on touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., contact
movement to the right on the touch-sensitive surface optionally moves the selection
indicator to the right, whether by the predefined amount or by the respective value of the
movement metric-the same optionally holds for any direction of contact movement on
the touch-sensitive surface).
[00229]         In some embodiments, the plurality of user interface elements 1002, 1004,
and 1006, include a plurality of navigation columns (e.g., plurality of navigation columns
adjacent to each other, each column including a plurality of vertically-arranged selectable
items, such as content items to watch, applications to launch, etc.), and moving selection
indicator 1008 by the predefined amount comprises moving the selection-indicator from a
first navigation column to a second navigation column, adjacent to the first navigation
column.

[00230]          In some embodiments, the plurality of user interface elements 1002, 1004,
and 1006, include a plurality of images, and moving selection-indicator 1008 by the
predefined amount comprises moving the selection-indicator from a first image to a
second image, adjacent to the first image.
[00231]          In some embodiments, the plurality of user interface elements 1002, 1004,
and 1006, include a plurality of content items in a grid arrangement (e.g., movies,
television shows, applications, games, etc., arranged in a grid, and selectable to access the
respective content items), and moving selection-indicator 1008 by the predefined amount
comprises moving the selection-indicator from a first content item to a second content
item, adjacent to the first content item.
[00232]          Fig. 1OD illustrates another exemplary scheme for moving selection
indicator 1008 by a predefined amount in response to detecting an input on touch
sensitive surface 451. As shown in Fig. 1OD, in some embodiments, selection-indicator
 1008 is moved by a predefined amount (e.g., by a single user interface element) in
response to detecting a tap input 1003 in one of edge regions 1010, 1012, 1014, 1016, of
touch-sensitive surface 451. For example, a tap detected in edge region 1012 optionally
moves selection-indicator 1008 to the right by one user interface element. Taps detected
in edge regions 1010, 1014, and 1016, optionally result in movement of selection
indicator 1008 up, down, and to the left, respectively, by one user interface element.
[00233]          In some embodiments, the unitary-movement criteria optionally include a
criterion that is met when contact 1003 is detected in a first edge region (e.g., region
 1012) of a plurality of edge regions (e.g., regions 1010, 1012, 1014, and 1016) of touch
sensitive surface 451 (e.g., a top, bottom, right, and/or left outer 5%, 10% or 20% of the
touch-sensitive surface), liftoff of the contact is detected within a first time period (e.g.,
.1, .3 or .5 seconds) of touchdown of the contact (e.g., a tap), and movement of the
contact is less than a movement threshold (e.g., less than .1, .3 or .5 cm). In some
embodiments, moving selection-indicator 1008 by the predefined amount comprises
moving the selection-indicator in a direction that corresponds to the first edge region
(e.g., region 1012) of touch-sensitive surface 451 in which contact 1003 was detected
(e.g., tapping in the right edge region of the touch-sensitive surface optionally moves the
selection-indicator in the UI to the right by the predefined amount).

[00235]         As described below, the method 1100 provides ways in which a device
optionally moves a cursor in a user interface by a predefined amount in response to
specified inputs. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when interacting
with a user interface on the device, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine
interface. For battery-operated electronic devices, increasing the efficiency of the user's
interaction with the user interface conserves power and increases the time between battery
charges.
[00236]         In some embodiments, an electronic device (e.g., a set top box or other
user interface generating device that is in communication with a remote control and a
display device, such as device 500 in Fig. 5) with one or more processors generates
(1102) a user interface for display on a display device (e.g., a television or other display
device). In some embodiments, the user interface includes a selection-indicator (e.g., a
glow, highlight or outline around a currently selected user interface element, such as
indicator 1008 in Fig. 1OA) indicating a currently selected user interface element of a
plurality of user interface elements (1104) (e.g., user interface elements 1002, 1004, and
 1006 in Fig. 10A). In some embodiments, the plurality of user interface elements include
a plurality of navigation columns (1106) (e.g., plurality of navigation columns adjacent to
each other, each column including a plurality of vertically-arranged selectable items, such
as content items to watch, applications to launch, etc.). In some embodiments, the
plurality of user interface elements include a plurality of images (1108). In some
embodiments, the plurality of user interface elements include a plurality of content items
in a grid arrangement (1110) (e.g., movies, television shows, games, etc., arranged in a
grid, and selectable to access the respective content items).
[00237]         In some embodiments, while the user interface is displayed on the display
device, the device receives (1112) an indication of a first input that includes a contact
                                             -76-

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
(e.g., contact 1001 in Fig. 10B) detected on a touch-sensitive surface of a device (e.g., a
touch-sensitive surface of a remote control or a portable multifunction device with a
touchscreen display, such as touch-sensitive surface 451). In some embodiments, the first
input corresponds to a respective value for a movement metric (1114) (e.g., a metric
expressing how much the selection-indicator in the user interface should move based on
how much the contact on the touch-sensitive surface moves. In other words, a metric
based on a relationship of contact movement to selection-indicator movement). For
example, the movement of contact 1001 on touch-sensitive surface 451 in Fig. 10B
optionally corresponds to a value for a movement metric for moving selection-indicator
 1008 in the user interface.
[00238]          In some embodiments, in response to receiving the indication of the first
input (1116) (e.g., the input defined by movement of contact 1001 in Fig. 10B), the
device determines (1118) whether the first input meets unitary-movement criteria (e.g.,
criteria that, when met, cause the selection-indicator in the user interface (e.g., indicator
 1008 in Fig. lOB) to move by a predefined amount, such as by a single user interface
element). In some embodiments, the unitary-movement criteria include a criterion that is
met when liftoff of the contact (e.g., contact 1001 in Fig. 10B) is detected within a first
time period (e.g., .2, .4, or 1 seconds) of touchdown of the contact, and movement of the
contact is greater than a first movement threshold (e.g., .1, .2 or .5 cm) but less than a
second movement threshold (1120) (e.g., 1 or 2 cm). In some embodiments, the first
movement threshold and the second movement threshold are defined in terms of contact
movement needed on the touch-sensitive surface to move the selection-indicator by a
single UI element in the user interface (1122) (e.g., if 1 cm of movement of the contact on
the touch-sensitive surface is needed to move the selection-indicator from a first UI object
(e.g., user interface element 1002) to a second UI object (e.g., user interface element
 1004) that is adjacent to the first UI object, the first movement threshold is optionally a
first percentage of 1 cm (e.g., 10% of 1 cm), and the second movement threshold is
optionally a second percentage of 1 cm (e.g., 100% of 1 cm)).
[00239]          In some embodiments, the unitary-movement criteria include a criterion
that is met when the contact (e.g., contact 1003 in Fig. 10D) is detected in a first edge
region (e.g., region 1012 in Fig. 1OD) of a plurality of edge regions of the touch-sensitive
surface (e.g., a top, bottom, right, and/or left outer 5%, 10% or 20% of the touch-sensitive
                                               -77-

WO 2015/200537                                                             PCT/US2015/037520
surface, as illustrated in Fig. 1OD), liftoff of the contact is detected within a first time
period (e.g., .1, .3 or .5 seconds) of touchdown of the contact (e.g., a tap), and movement
of the contact is less than a movement threshold (1124) (e.g., less than .1, .3 or .5 cm).
[00240]          In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the first
input meets the unitary-movement criteria, the device moves (1126) the selection
indicator by a predefined amount in the user interface (e.g., a predefined amount not
based on the respective value for the selection-indicator movement metric. In some
embodiments, the respective value for the movement metric can be less than a value that
would cause the selection-indicator in the user interface to be moved by one unit, or
greater than a value that would cause the selection-indicator in the user interface to be
moved by one unit). In some embodiments, moving the selection-indicator by the
predefined amount in the user interface comprises moving the selection-indicator to
indicate selection of an adjacent user interface element in the plurality of user interface
elements (1128) (e.g., as illustrated in Figs. 1OC and 1OD). In some embodiments,
moving the selection-indicator by the predefined amount comprises moving the selection
indicator in accordance with a direction of a movement of the contact on the touch
sensitive surface (1130) (e.g., contact movement to the right on the touch-sensitive
surface will move the selection-indicator to the right, as illustrated in Fig. 10C). In some
embodiments, moving the selection-indicator by the predefined amount comprises
moving the selection-indicator in a direction that corresponds to the first edge region of
the touch-sensitive surface in which the contact was detected (1132) (e.g., tapping in the
right edge region of the touch-sensitive surface will move the selection-indicator in the UI
to the right by the predefined amount, as illustrated in Fig. 1OD). In some embodiments,
moving the selection-indicator by the predefined amount comprises moving the selection
indicator from a first navigation column to a second navigation column, adjacent to the
first navigation column (1134). In some embodiments, moving the selection-indicator by
the predefined amount comprises moving the selection-indicator from a first image to a
second image, adjacent to the first image (1136). In some embodiments, moving the
selection-indicator by the predefined amount comprises moving the selection-indicator
from a first content item to a second content item, adjacent to the first content item
(1138).

[00241]           In some embodiments, in accordance with a determination that the first
input does not meet the unitary-movement criteria, the device moves (1140) the selection
indicator in accordance with the respective value of the movement metric associated with
the first input (e.g., moving the selection-indicator in the user interface by an amount
defined by the magnitude of movement of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface. In
some embodiments, this is optionally beyond the predefined amount that the selection
indicator would move if the first input met the unitary movement criteria). Such
movement of the selection-indicator in accordance with the respective value of the
movement metric associated with the first input is illustrated in Fig. lOB. In some
embodiments, moving the selection-indicator in accordance with the respective value of
the movement metric comprises moving the selection-indicator in accordance with a
direction of a movement of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface (1142) (e.g., contact
movement to the right on the touch-sensitive surface will move the selection-indicator to
the right, as illustrated in Fig. 10B).
[00242]           It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in
Figs. 11 A-1 ID have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate
that the described order is the only order in which the operations could be performed.
One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations
described herein. Additionally, it should be noted that details of other processes
described herein with respect to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 700, 900,
 1300 and 1500) are also applicable in an analogous manner to method 1100 described
above with respect to Figs. 11 A-1ID.     For example, the user interface, display device and
touch-sensitive surface described above with reference to method 1100 optionally have
one or more of the characteristics of the user interfaces, display devices and touch
sensitive surfaces described herein with reference to other methods described herein (e.g.,
methods 700, 900, 1300 and 1500). For brevity, these details are not repeated here.
[00243]           The operations in the information processing methods described above are,
optionally, implemented by running one or more functional modules in an information
processing apparatus such as general purpose processors (e.g., as described above with
respect to Figs. 1A, 3 and 5) or application specific chips.
[00244]           The operations described above with reference to Figs. 11 A-1ID are,
optionally, implemented by components depicted in Figs. lA-lB. For example,

generation operation 1102, receiving operation 1112, determination operation 1118, and
moving operations 1126 and 1140 are, optionally, implemented by event sorter 170, event
recognizer 180, and event handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a
contact on touch-sensitive display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the
event information to application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application
 136-1 compares the event information to respective event definitions 186, and determines
whether a first contact at a first location on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a
predefined event or sub-event, such as selection of an object on a user interface. When a
respective predefined event or sub-event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an
event handler 190 associated with the detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler
 190 optionally utilizes or calls data updater 176 or object updater 177 to update the
application internal state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a
respective GUI updater 178 to update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it
would be clear to a person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be
implemented based on the components depicted in Figs. lA-lB.
                                       Grip Recognition
[00245]         A device with a touch-sensitive surface (e.g., a remote control with a
touch-sensitive surface) may be used to interact with an electronic device. Some people
using the device (e.g., the remote) to interact with the electronic device may hold the
device differently than other people using the device. This difference in grip may result
in users providing input to the touch-sensitive surface that, while meant to be the same
input, looks slightly different based on the grip of the device (e.g., whether the user is
holding the device in the user's right hand or the user's left hand, and whether the user is
providing the input to the touch-sensitive surface using the user's right hand or the user's
left hand). Thus, it can be beneficial to interpret inputs to the touch-sensitive surface
based on the grip of the user to improve the accuracy of gesture detection (e.g., by more
accurately determining user intent for a gesture based on a grip of the user while detecting
the gesture). The embodiments described below provide ways to allow for such input
interpretation by an electronic device. Enhancing interactions with a device in this way
reduces the amount of time needed by a user to perform operations, and thus reduces the
power usage of the device and increases battery life for battery-powered devices.

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
[00246]          Figs. 12A-12E illustrate exemplary ways in which inputs on a touch
sensitive surface are interpreted based on the grip of a user in accordance with some
embodiments of the disclosure. The embodiments in these figures are used to illustrate
the processes described below, including the processes described with reference to Figs.
 13A-13C.
[00247]          Fig. 12A illustrates an exemplary input detected on touch-sensitive surface
451 of a device. Touch-sensitive surface 451 is optionally included in a device (e.g., a
touch-sensitive surface of a remote control or a portable multifunction device with a
touchscreen display, such as remote 510 in Fig. 5). The device is optionally used to
interact with an electronic device, such as device 500 in Fig. 5. Additionally, the device
is optionally a device that is held in one hand, and a user is optionally able to provide
input to touch-sensitive surface 451 using a finger on the same hand in which the user is
holding the device. For example, the device is optionally a remote control having touch
sensitive surface 451. The remote control is optionally held in either the user's right hand
or left hand, and input to touch-sensitive surface 451 on the remote control is optionally
provided by the thumb, for example, of the hand in which the user is holding the remote
control.
[00248]          The input detected on touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally includes
movement of contact 1201 (e.g., a finger contact or stylus contact), as illustrated. In some
embodiments, contact 1201 optionally corresponds to a thumb contact, as described
above.
[00249]          As stated above, it can be beneficial to interpret the movement of contact
 1201 based on a determined grip of the user holding a device that includes touch-sensitive
surface 451, because the grip of the user optionally affects the shape of the movement of
the contact. For example, a left-to-right horizontal swipe might look like the movement
of contact 1201, as illustrated in Fig. 12A, when inputted by a user's right thumb when
the user is holding the device that includes touch-sensitive surface 451 in the user's right
hand. In such a circumstance, the electronic device (e.g., device 500 in Fig. 5) with
which the device with touch-sensitive surface 451 (e.g., remote 510 in Fig. 5) interacts
optionally uses knowledge of the user's grip to interpret the movement of contact 1201 to
be a left-to-right horizontal swipe, despite the fact that the beginning of the movement of
the contact has upward trajectory. In contrast, if the electronic device has knowledge that
                                              -81-

WO 2015/200537                                                             PCT/US2015/037520
the user is holding the device that includes touch-sensitive surface 451 in the user's left
hand, the electronic device optionally interprets the movement of contact 1201 to be more
than just a left-to-right horizontal swipe, because a left-to-right horizontal swipe inputted
by, for example, the user's left thumb while holding the device in the user's left hand
optionally does not look like the movement of contact 1201, as illustrated in Fig. 12A.
[00250]          To facilitate such grip-specific interpretations of inputs, in some
embodiments, the electronic device determines a grip of a user using the device (e.g.,
determines whether the device that includes touch-sensitive surface 451 is being held in a
user's right hand or the user's left hand). The electronic device optionally interprets the
movement of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g., contact 1201 on touch
sensitive surface 451) based at least in part on the grip of the user. For example, the
electronic device optionally interprets the movement of the contact as a first gesture (e.g.,
a horizontal swipe) if the grip is determined to be right-handed, and interprets the
movement of the contact as a second gesture (e.g., a vertical swipe plus a horizontal
swipe) if the grip is determined to be left-handed.
[00251]          In some embodiments, determining the grip of the user using the device
comprises determining the grip of the user using the device based at least in part on an
orientation of the device. In some embodiments, determining the grip of the user using
the device comprises determining the grip of the user using the device based on an
average orientation of the device over a most recent predetermined time period (e.g., 30,
90, or 180 seconds). In some embodiments, the orientation of the device is determined
based on an accelerometer or other orientation sensor in the device.
[00252]          Because the electronic device optionally interprets movement of a contact
differently based on a determined grip of a user, actions resulting from the movement of
the contact are optionally also different based on the grip of the user, as illustrated in Figs.
 12B-12C. Thus, in some embodiments, interpreting the movement of the contact on the
touch-sensitive surface (e.g., the movement of contact 1201 on touch-sensitive surface
451) based at least in part on the grip of the user comprises, in accordance with a
determination that the grip is a first grip (e.g., right-handed grip, as shown in Fig. 12B),
performing a first action in response to the first input, and, in accordance with a
determination that the grip is a second grip (e.g., left-handed grip, as shown in Fig. 12C),
different from the first grip, performing a second action in response to the first input,
                                               -82-

WO 2015/200537                                                              PCT/US2015/037520
different from the first action. With respect to the input shown in Fig. 12A, in some
embodiments, the first action is optionally a purely horizontal movement of a cursor in a
user interface (e.g., a purely horizontal movement of cursor 1210 in Fig. 12B in response
to the upward and rightward movement of contact 1201); the second action is optionally a
vertical movement of the cursor in the user interface, followed by a horizontal movement
of the cursor in the user interface (which mirrors the movement of contact 1201 on touch
sensitive surface 451, such as the upward and rightward movement of cursor 1210 in Fig.
 12C in response to the upward and rightward movement of contact 1201). Thus, as
illustrated in Figs. 12B-12C, the same movement of contact 1201 on touch-sensitive
surface 451 optionally produces different actions depending on the determined grip of the
user.
[00253]           In some embodiments, the electronic device provides feedback
information for display on a display device (e.g., a television or other display device), the
feedback information including information about the determined grip of the user using
the device, and the interpretation of the movement of contact 1201 on touch-sensitive
surface 451 (e.g., the electronic device displays feedback after interpreting the movement
of the contact to inform the user of the grip/gesture detected, possibly allowing the user to
correct the grip determination or the contact movement interpretation).
[00254]           In some embodiments, the electronic device optionally ignores different
portions of the movement of contact 1201 depending on the determined grip of the user,
as will be described in more detail below.
[00255]           Fig. 12D illustrates an exemplary scenario in which the electronic device
ignores a first portion of the movement of contact 1201. In some embodiments,
interpreting the movement of contact 1201 on touch-sensitive surface 451 based at least
in part on the grip of the user comprises, in accordance with a determination that the grip
is a first grip (e.g., right-handed grip), ignoring a first portion 1202 of the movement of
the contact. In some embodiments, the electronic device optionally ignores portion 1202
of the movement of contact 1201, and relies only on portion 1204 of the movement of the
contact in interpreting the movement of the contact.
[00256]           In some embodiments, the first grip comprises a right-handed grip, and
ignoring the first portion of the movement of contact 1201 comprises, in accordance with
                                               -83-

WO 2015/200537                                                              PCT/US2015/037520
a determination that the movement of the contact is from right to left on the touch
sensitive surface, ignoring an end of the movement of the contact. In some embodiments,
ignoring the first portion of the movement of contact comprises, in accordance with a
determination that the movement of the contact is from left to right on the touch-sensitive
surface (as illustrated in Fig. 12D), ignoring a beginning (e.g., portion 1202) of the
movement of the contact. For example, if the grip is right-handed, the joint of the finger
(e.g., thumb) providing the contact will optionally be to the right of the touch-sensitive
surface on the device. The one or more portions of the first input detected at a location on
the touch-sensitive surface far from the joint (e.g., portion 1202 in Fig. 12D) are
optionally distorted due to reaching the limit of the finger's extension-those portions are
optionally ignored.
[00257]          Fig. 12E illustrates an exemplary scenario in which the electronic device
ignores a second portion of the movement of contact 1201. In some embodiments,
interpreting the movement of contact 1201 on touch-sensitive surface 451 based at least
in part on the grip of the user comprises, in accordance with a determination that the grip
is a second grip (e.g., left-handed grip), different from the first grip, ignoring a second
portion 1208 of the movement of contact 1201, different from the first portion 1202 of the
movement of the contact. In some embodiments, the electronic device optionally ignores
portion 1208 of the movement of contact 1201, and relies only on portion 1206 of the
movement of the contact in interpreting the movement of the contact.
[00258]          In some embodiments, the second grip comprises a left-handed grip, and
ignoring the second portion of the movement of contact 1201 comprises, in accordance
with a determination that the movement of the contact is from right to left on the touch
sensitive surface, ignoring a beginning of the movement of the contact. In some
embodiments, ignoring the second portion of the movement of the contact comprises, in
accordance with a determination that the movement of the contact is from left to right on
the touch-sensitive surface (as illustrated in Fig. 12E), ignoring an end (e.g., portion
 1208) of the movement of the contact. For example, if the grip is left-handed, the joint of
the finger (e.g., thumb) providing the contact will optionally be to the left of the touch
sensitive surface on the device. The one or more portions of the first input detected at a
location on the touch-sensitive surface far from the joint (e.g., portion 1208 in Fig. 12E)
                                              -84-

are optionally distorted due to reaching the limit of the finger's extension-those portions
are optionally ignored.
[00259]          Figs. 13A-13C are flow diagrams illustrating a method 1300 of
interpreting an input detected on a touch-sensitive surface based on the grip of a user in
accordance with some embodiments. The method 1300 is optionally performed at an
electronic device such as device 500 as described above with reference to Fig. 5,
including a set top box or other user interface generating device that is in communication
with a remote control and a display device. Some operations in method 1300 are,
optionally, combined and/or the order of some operations is, optionally, changed.
[00260]          As described below, the method 1300 provides ways in which inputs on a
touch-sensitive surface are optionally interpreted based on the grip of a user. The method
reduces the cognitive burden on a user when interacting with a user interface on the
device, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine interface. For battery-operated
electronic devices, increasing the efficiency of the user's interaction with the user
interface conserves power and increases the time between battery charges.

user interface generating device that is in communication with a remote control and a
display device, such as device 500 in Fig. 5) with one or more processors receives (1302)
an indication of a first input that includes movement of a contact (e.g., a finger contact or
stylus contact, such as contact 1201 in Fig. 12A. In some embodiments, the contact
optionally corresponds to a thumb contact) detected on a touch-sensitive surface of a
device (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface of a remote control or a portable multifunction
device with a touchscreen display, such as touch-sensitive surface 451 in Fig. 12A).
[00262]          In some embodiments, the device determines (1304) a grip of a user using
the device (e.g., the device determines whether the device is being held in the user's right
hand or the user's left hand). In some embodiments, determining the grip of the user
using the device comprises determining the grip of the user using the device based at least
in part on an orientation of the device (1306). In some embodiments, determining the
grip of the user using the device comprises determining the grip of the user using the
device based on an average orientation of the device over a most recent predetermined
time period (1308) (e.g., 30, 90, or 180 seconds). In some embodiments, the orientation
                                              -85-

WO 2015/200537                                                              PCT/US2015/037520
 of the device is determined based on an accelerometer or other orientation sensor in the
device (1310).
 [00263]          In some embodiments, the device interprets (1312) the movement of the
contact (e.g., contact 1201 in Fig. 12A) on the touch-sensitive surface based at least in
part on the grip of the user (e.g., the device interprets the movement of the contact as a
first gesture (e.g., horizontal swipe) if the grip is determined to be right-handed, and
interprets the movement of the contact as a second gesture (e.g., vertical swipe +
horizontal swipe) if the grip is determined to be left-handed). In some embodiments,
interpreting the movement of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface based at least in
part on the grip of the user comprises (1314), in accordance with a determination that the
grip is a first grip (e.g., a right-handed grip), performing (1316) a first action in response
to the first input. In some embodiments, interpreting the movement of the contact on the
touch-sensitive surface based at least in part on the grip of the user comprises (1314), in
 accordance with a determination that the grip is a second grip (e.g., a left-handed grip),
different from the first grip, performing (1318) a second action in response to the first
input, different from the first action. For example, the movement of contact 1201
illustrated in Fig. 12A optionally results in performance of a first action if the user's grip
is determined to be right-handed, and a second action if the user's grip is determined to be
left-handed.
 [00264]          In some embodiments, interpreting the movement of the contact on the
touch-sensitive surface based at least in part on the grip of the user comprises (1320), in
 accordance with a determination that the grip is a first grip (e.g., a right-handed grip),
ignoring (1322) a first portion (e.g., portion 1202 in Fig. 12D) of the movement of the
contact. In some embodiments, the first grip comprises a right-handed grip (1324). In
 some embodiments, ignoring the first portion of the movement of the contact comprises
 (1326), in accordance with a determination that the movement of the contact is from right
to left on the touch-sensitive surface, ignoring (1328) an end of the movement of the
contact. In some embodiments, ignoring the first portion of the movement of the contact
comprises (1326), in accordance with a determination that the movement of the contact is
from left to right on the touch-sensitive surface, ignoring (1330) a beginning (e.g., portion
 1202 in Fig. 12D) of the movement of the contact (e.g., if the grip is right-handed, the
joint of the finger (e.g., thumb) providing the contact is optionally to the right of the

touch-sensitive surface on the device. The portions of the first input detected at a location
on the touch-sensitive surface far from the joint (e.g., portion 1202 in Fig. 12D) are
optionally distorted due to reaching the limit of the finger's extension. Those portions are
optionally ignored). The remaining portions of the first input (e.g., portion 1204 in Fig.
 12D) are optionally not ignored.
[00265]          In some embodiments, interpreting the movement of the contact on the
touch-sensitive surface based at least in part on the grip of the user comprises (1320), in
accordance with a determination that the grip is a second grip (e.g., a left-handed grip),
different from the first grip, ignoring (1332) a second portion (e.g., portion 1208 in Fig.
 12E) of the movement of the contact, different from the first portion of the movement of
the contact. In some embodiments, the second grip comprises a left-handed grip (1334).
In some embodiments, ignoring the second portion of the movement of the contact
comprises (1336), in accordance with a determination that the movement of the contact is
from right to left on the touch-sensitive surface, ignoring (1338) a beginning of the
movement of the contact. In some embodiments, ignoring the second portion of the
movement of the contact comprises (1336), in accordance with a determination that the
movement of the contact is from left to right on the touch-sensitive surface, ignoring
(1340) an end (e.g., portion 1208 in Fig. 12E) of the movement of the contact. For
example, if the grip is left-handed, the joint of the finger (e.g., thumb) providing the
contact is optionally to the left of the touch-sensitive surface on the device. The portions
of the first input detected at a location on the touch-sensitive surface far from the joint are
optionally distorted due to reaching the limit of the finger's extension. Those portions are
optionally ignored. The remaining portions of the first input (e.g., portion 1206 in Fig.
 12E) are optionally not ignored.
[00266]          In some embodiments, the device provides (1342) feedback information
for display on a display device (e.g., a television or other display device), the feedback
information including information about the determined grip of the user using the device,
and the interpretation of the movement of the contact on the touch-sensitive surface (e.g.,
the electronic device displays feedback after interpreting the movement of the contact to
inform the user of the grip/gesture detected, possibly allowing the user to correct the grip
determination or the contact movement interpretation).

[00267]         It should be understood that the particular order in which the operations in
Figs. 13A-13C have been described is merely exemplary and is not intended to indicate
that the described order is the only order in which the operations could be performed.
One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize various ways to reorder the operations
described herein. Additionally, it should be noted that details of other processes
described herein with respect to other methods described herein (e.g., methods 700, 900,
 1100 and 1500) are also applicable in an analogous manner to method 1300 described
above with respect to Figs. 13A-13C. For example, the touch-sensitive surface described
above with reference to method 1300 optionally has one or more of the characteristics of
the touch-sensitive surfaces described herein with reference to other methods described
herein (e.g., methods 700, 900, 1100 and 1500). For brevity, these details are not
repeated here.
[00268]         The operations in the information processing methods described above are,
optionally, implemented by running one or more functional modules in an information
processing apparatus such as general purpose processors (e.g., as described above with
respect to Figs. 1A, 3 and 5) or application specific chips.
[00269]         The operations described above with reference to Figs. 13A-13C are,
optionally, implemented by components depicted in Figs. lA-lB. For example, receiving
operation 1302, determination operation 1304, and interpretation operation 1312 are,
optionally, implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event handler
 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive display
 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to application 136-1.
A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the event information to
respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first contact at a first location
on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event or sub-event, such as
selection of an object on a user interface. When a respective predefined event or sub
event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler 190 associated with the
detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally utilizes or calls data
updater 176 or object updater 177 to update the application internal state 192. In some
embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a respective GUI updater 178 to update what is
displayed by the application. Similarly, it would be clear to a person having ordinary

[00270]           There are many instances in which a user may wish to provide text input to
an electronic device (e.g., to provide a username or a password). Providing such text
input using handwritten input is often simpler for a user than having to use an onscreen
keyboard. Thus, it can be beneficial for an electronic device to provide a robust
handwritten input user interface such that user interaction with the electronic device is
enhanced. The embodiments described below provide ways for providing such a
handwritten input user interface. Enhancing interactions with a device in this way
reduces the amount of time needed by a user to perform operations, and thus reduces the
power usage of the device and increases battery life for battery-powered devices.
[00271]           Figs. 14A-14C illustrate exemplary ways in which an electronic device
presents a handwritten input user interface according to some embodiments of the
disclosure. The embodiments in these figures are used to illustrate the processes
described below, including the processes described with reference to Figs. 15A-15D.
[00272]           Fig. 14A illustrates an exemplary handwritten input user interface
displayed on display 450. The user interface optionally includes text entry field 1402.
Text entry field 1402 is optionally any area of the user interface into which text is to be
inputted, such as a search field, a web address field, and/or a username/password field.
Text (e.g., letters, numbers, words, symbols, etc.) is optionally inputted into text entry
field 1402 by providing handwritten input on touch-sensitive surface 451.
[00273]           In some embodiments, the handwritten input provided on touch-sensitive
surface 451 optionally corresponds to more than one character (e.g., letter, number,
symbol, etc.). For example, the movement of contact 1401 on touch-sensitive surface 451
optionally corresponds to a lower case "c" and an upper case "C", as both the lower case
"c" and the upper case "C" are optionally associated with the same or similar contact
movement on the touch-sensitive surface. The movement of contact 1401 optionally also
corresponds to an "0" and a "0", because the movement optionally corresponds to
respective portions of the "0" and the "0" characters. In such circumstances, the
electronic device optionally needs to determine which of the plurality of characters to
                                              -89-

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
which the movement of contact 1401 corresponds to input into text entry field 1402. In
some embodiments, this determination optionally depends on whether text entry field
 1402 is tolerant of character ambiguity.
[00274]          In some embodiments, text entry field 1402 is optionally tolerant of
character ambiguity. In other words, text entry field 1402 is optionally a text entry field
in which some ambiguity about the characters entered into the text entry field is
acceptable. For example, if text entry field 1402 is a web address field (e.g., a Uniform
Resource Locator (URL) field), the cases, for example, of characters entered into the text
entry field are optionally unimportant. In such circumstances, entering "www.xyz.com"
in text entry field 1402 is optionally equally as acceptable as entering "www.xYz.com" in
the text entry field, because the cases of characters in a URL address are optionally
ignored when resolving the URL address. The above discussion optionally similarly
applies to other kinds of character ambiguity in addition to character case ambiguity, such
as ambiguity as to whether a character is a letter or a number (e.g., 0 vs 0).
[00275]          In circumstances in which text entry field 1402 is tolerant of character
ambiguity, in response to receiving an input that optionally corresponds to a plurality of
candidate characters (e.g., the movement of contact 1401 that optionally corresponds to a
lower case "c" and an upper case "C"), the electronic device optionally displays a top
candidate character (e.g., the candidate character that the electronic device determines is
the best match for the handwritten input) in the text entry field. As shown in Fig. 14A, in
some embodiments, the electronic device is displaying an upper case "C" 1404 in text
entry field 1402 in response to the input received on touch-sensitive surface 451. In some
embodiments, the determination as to whether text entry field 1402 is tolerant of character
ambiguity is made after receiving an indication of the end of the input received on touch
sensitive surface 451.
[00276]          However, in some circumstances, a text entry field in a user interface is
optionally not tolerant of character ambiguity.
[00277]          Fig. 14B illustrates an exemplary handwritten input user interface
displayed on display 450 when a text entry field in the user interface is not tolerant of
character ambiguity. The user interface optionally includes text entry field 1410. Text
entry field 1410 is optionally any area of the user interface into which text is to be
                                             -90-

WO 2015/200537                                                           PCT/US2015/037520
inputted, such as a search field, a web address field, and/or a username/password field, as
discussed above. Text (e.g., letters, numbers, words, symbols, etc.) is optionally inputted
into text entry field 1410 by providing handwritten input using touch- sensitive surface
451, as discussed above.
[00278]          In some embodiments, text entry field 1410 is optionally not tolerant of
character ambiguity. In other words, text entry field 1410 is optionally a text entry field
in which ambiguity about the characters entered into the text entry field is not acceptable.
For example, if text entry field 1410 is a password entry field, the cases, for example, of
characters entered into the text entry field are optionally important. In such
circumstances, entering "xyz" in text entry field 1410 is optionally not equally as
acceptable as entering "xYz" in the text entry field, because the cases of characters in a
password are optionally not ignored when determining whether a password is a correct
password. The above discussion optionally similarly applies to other kinds of character
ambiguity in addition to character case ambiguity, such as ambiguity as to whether a
character is a letter or a number (e.g., 0 vs 0).
[00279]          In circumstances in which text entry field 1410 is not tolerant of character
ambiguity, in response to receiving an input that optionally corresponds to a plurality of
candidate characters (e.g., the movement of contact 1401 that optionally corresponds to a
lower case "c" and an upper case "C"), the electronic device optionally displays at least
two character selection options 1406 that correspond to at least two of the plurality of
candidate characters. These character selection options 1406 optionally allow a user to
indicate which of the character selection options should be inputted in text entry field
 1410. As shown in Fig. 14B, in some embodiments, the electronic device is displaying
character selection options 1406 that include an upper case "C", a lower case "c", an "0",
and a "0" in response to the input received on touch-sensitive surface 451. In some
embodiments, the determination as to whether text entry field 1410 is tolerant of character
ambiguity is made after receiving an indication of the end of the input received on touch
sensitive surface 451. In some embodiments, one of character selection options 1406 is
optionally selected to input the selected character option into text entry field 1410.
[00280]          Fig. 14C illustrates an exemplary handwritten input user interface
displayed on display 450 when a character selection option is selected in response to a
selection input. As discussed above, one of character selection options 1406 is optionally
                                              -91-

WO 2015/200537                                                            PCT/US2015/037520
selected to input that selected character option into text entry field 1410. Selection of one
of character selection options 1406 is optionally accomplished in any appropriate manner.
As shown in Fig. 14C, in some embodiments, selection of a character selection option is
in response to detecting an input in a region of touch-sensitive surface 451 that
corresponds to the character selection option.
[00281]          Specifically, character selection options 1406 are optionally displayed in a
layout similar to a layout of touch-sensitive surface 451. As shown in Fig. 14C, in some
embodiments, character selection options 1406 are displayed in a 2x2 grid, and touch
sensitive surface 451 has a 2x2 grid of regions. Detection of an input (e.g., a tap or a
click) in one of the regions of touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally results in selection of
the character selection option that is in the grid region corresponding to the region on
touch-sensitive surface in which the input was detected. For example, detection of an
input in the upper-left region of touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally results in selection
of character selection option "C", detection of an input in the lower-left region of touch
sensitive surface 451 optionally results in selection of character selection option "0",
detection of an input in the lower-right region of touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally
results in selection of character selection option "0", and detection of an input in the
upper-right region of touch-sensitive surface 451 optionally results in selection of
character selection option "c". As shown in Fig. 14C, in some embodiments, contact
 1403 has been detected in the upper-right region of touch-sensitive surface 451, and as a
result, lower case "c" 1408 has been selected and inputted into text entry field 1410. As
such, the electronic device allows a user to specify which character the user wishes to
input to the device when ambiguity as to the handwritten character exists.
[00282]          In some embodiments, ambiguity as to the character being inputted on
touch-sensitive surface 451 is optionally resolved by the device in response to further
handwritten input being detected by using the further handwritten input to further narrow
the possible characters to a single most- probable character. For example, a first portion
of the handwritten input optionally corresponds to the upper case and lower case versions
of a character (e.g., the downward stroke of a lower case "1"and an upper case "L").
However, as a second portion of the handwritten input is detected (e.g., the horizontal
stroke of an upper case "L"), the first and second portions of the handwritten input
together optionally define the case of the character. In such circumstances, character
                                              -92-

WO 2015/200537                                                           PCT/US2015/037520
selection options (e.g., character selection options 1406) are optionally displayed in
response to detecting the first portion of the handwritten input, and are optionally no
longer displayed in response to detecting the second portion of the handwritten input,
which optionally resolves the ambiguity of the character being inputted, as described
above. In some embodiments, character ambiguity is resolved because the first and
second portions of the handwritten input together define a different character that does
not have ambiguous case (e.g., the first portion of the handwritten input optionally
corresponds to a lower case "1"and an upper case "L", as above, and the second portion
of the handwritten input optionally defines the character to be a "D" rather than an "1"or
an "L". In some embodiments, the first and second portions of the handwritten input
together define a number instead of a letter, and thus the character ambiguity is
resolved-for example, the first portion of the handwritten input optionally corresponds
to a lower case "1"and an upper case "L", as above, and the second portion of the
handwritten input optionally defines the character to be a "4").
[00283]         Figs. 15A-15D are flow diagrams illustrating a method 1500 of detecting
handwritten input in accordance with some embodiments. The method 1500 is optionally
performed at an electronic device such as device 500 as described above with reference to
Fig. 5, including a set top box or other user interface generating device that is in
communication with a remote control and a display device. Some operations in method
 1500 are, optionally, combined and/or the order of some operations is, optionally,
changed.
[00284]         As described below, the method 1500 provides ways in which a device
optionally responds to receiving an indication of an input that corresponds to a plurality
of candidate characters. The method reduces the cognitive burden on a user when
interacting with a user interface on the device, and reduces the need for the user to
physically interact with the device, thereby creating a more efficient human-machine
interface. For battery-operated electronic devices, increasing the efficiency of the user's
interaction with the user interface conserves power and increases the time between battery
charges.
[00285]         In some embodiments, an electronic device (e.g., a set top box or other
user interface generating device that is in communication with a remote control and a
display device, such as device 500 in Fig. 5) with one or more processors generates

(1502) a user interface for display on a display device (e.g., a television or other display
device, such as display 450 in Fig. 14A). In some embodiments, the user interface
includes a text entry field (1504) (e.g., search field, web address field,
username/password fields, etc., such as text entry fields 1402 and 1410 in Figs. 14A
 14C).
[00286]          In some embodiments, while the user interface is displayed on the display
device, the device receives (1506) an indication of a first input that includes movement of
a contact (e.g., a finger contact or stylus contact, such as contact 1401 in Figs. 14A-14B)
detected on a touch-sensitive surface of a device (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface of a
remote control or a portable multifunction device with a touchscreen display, such as
touch-sensitive surface 451 in Figs. 14A-14B). In some embodiments, the movement of
the contact corresponds to a plurality of candidate characters (1508) (e.g., a letter, a
number, a word, a symbol, etc., such as described with reference to Figs. 14A-14B).
[00287]          In some embodiments, in response receiving the indication of the first
input (1510), in accordance with a determination that the text entry field is tolerant of
character ambiguity (e.g., a search field; that is, a text entry field for which upper vs.
lower case character input does not matter, for example, such as text entry field 1402 in
Fig. 14A), the device displays (1512) a top candidate character of the plurality of
candidate characters in the text entry field (e.g., the device optionally automatically
selects the top candidate if case does not matter, such as character 1404 in Fig. 14A). In
some embodiments, the character ambiguity comprises ambiguity as to the case of a
character entered into the text entry field (1514) (e.g., s vs S). In some embodiments, the
character ambiguity comprises ambiguity as to whether a character entered into the text
entry field is a letter or a number (1516) (e.g., 0 vs 0). In some embodiments, the
determination as to the character ambiguity tolerance of the text entry field is made after
receiving an indication of an end of the first input (1518).
[00288]          In some embodiments, in response receiving the indication of the first

input the selected character into the text entry field). In some embodiments, the character
ambiguity comprises ambiguity as to the case of a character entered into the text entry
field (1522). In some embodiments, the character ambiguity comprises ambiguity as to
whether a character entered into the text entry field is a letter or a number (1524). In
some embodiments, the text entry field is determined to be a text entry field that is not
tolerant of character ambiguity when the text entry field is a password entry field (1526).
In some embodiments, the determination as to the character ambiguity tolerance of the
text entry field is made after receiving an indication of an end of the first input (1528). In
some embodiments, the plurality of character selection options includes an upper case
version and a lower case version of a character (1530) (as illustrated in Fig. 14B).
[00289]          In some embodiments, the device receives (1532) an indication of a second
input (e.g., contact 1403 in Fig. 14C) detected on the touch-sensitive surface of the device
(e.g., a touch-sensitive surface of a remote control or a portable multifunction device with
a touchscreen display). In some embodiments, in response to receiving the indication of
the second input (1534), in accordance with a determination that the second input
corresponds to the lower case version of the character (e.g., a tap in a specific region of
the touch-sensitive surface of the device associated with the lower case version of the
character, or a particular gesture associated with the lower case version of the character.
For example, in Fig. 14C, contact 1403 detected in the upper-right region of touch
sensitive surface 451), the device inputs (1536) the lower case version of the character
into the text entry field (e.g., lower case "c" 1408 into text entry field 1410 in Fig. 14C).
In some embodiments, in response to receiving the indication of the second input (1534),
in accordance with a determination that the second input corresponds to the upper case
version of the character (e.g., a tap in a specific region of the touch-sensitive surface of
the device associated with the upper case version of the character, or a particular gesture
associated with the upper case version of the character. For example, in Fig. 14C, a
contact detected in the upper-left region of touch-sensitive surface 451), the device inputs
(1538) the upper case version of the character into the text entry field.
[00290]          In some embodiments, a first region of the touch-sensitive surface of the
device (e.g., a touch-sensitive surface of a remote control or a portable multifunction
device with a touchscreen display) is associated with a first candidate character of the

451 being associated with the lower case "c" in character selection options 1406 in Fig.
 14C), and a second region of the touch-sensitive surface of the device, different than the
first region, is associated with a second candidate character of the plurality of candidate
characters (1540) (e.g., the upper-left region of touch-sensitive surface 451 being
associated with the upper case "C" in character selection options 1406 in Fig. 14C). In
some embodiments, the relative location of the first region on the touch-sensitive surface
to the second region on the touch-sensitive surface is the same as the relative location of
the first candidate character to the second candidate character in the user interface. That
is, the plurality of character selection options is displayed in a layout similar to a layout of
the touch-sensitive surface of the device. In some embodiments, the device receives
(1542) an indication of a second input (e.g., tap or tap-and-click) detected on the touch
sensitive surface of the device. In some embodiments, in response to receiving the
indication of the second input (1544), in accordance with a determination that the second
input was detected on the first region of the touch-sensitive surface of the device, the
device inputs (1546) the first candidate character into the text entry field. In some
embodiments, in response to receiving the indication of the second input (1544), in
accordance with a determination that the second input was detected on the second region
of the touch-sensitive surface of the device, the device inputs (1548) the second candidate
character into the text entry field. For example, the plurality of character selection
options are optionally displayed as a 2x2 grid in the user interface (as illustrated in Fig.
 14C), with a first character in the top-left, a second character in the top-right, a third
character in the bottom-right, and a fourth character in the bottom-left. Selection of a
respective one of the characters is optionally accomplished by tapping in the region on the
touch-sensitive surface (top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left) corresponding to the
region in the grid in which the respective character is displayed, as illustrated in Fig. 14C.

 1520 are, optionally, implemented by event sorter 170, event recognizer 180, and event
handler 190. Event monitor 171 in event sorter 170 detects a contact on touch-sensitive
display 112, and event dispatcher module 174 delivers the event information to
application 136-1. A respective event recognizer 180 of application 136-1 compares the
event information to respective event definitions 186, and determines whether a first
contact at a first location on the touch-sensitive surface corresponds to a predefined event
or sub-event, such as selection of an object on a user interface. When a respective
predefined event or sub-event is detected, event recognizer 180 activates an event handler
 190 associated with the detection of the event or sub-event. Event handler 190 optionally
utilizes or calls data updater 176 or object updater 177 to update the application internal
state 192. In some embodiments, event handler 190 accesses a respective GUI updater
 178 to update what is displayed by the application. Similarly, it would be clear to a
person having ordinary skill in the art how other processes can be implemented based on
the components depicted in Figs. lA-1B.
