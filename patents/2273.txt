                                 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]      The invention relates to new methods of modulating cholesterol in a subject by
inhibiting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) protein with fatty acid
derivatives; and new methods for treating or preventing a metabolic disease comprising the
administration of an effective amount of a fatty acid derivative. The present invention is also
directed to fatty acid bioative derivatives and their use in the treatment of metabolic diseases.
                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]      Recent studies have demonstrated that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type
9 (PCSK9) could be an attractive therapeutic target for lowering low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C).      In terms of validation, gain or loss-of-function PCSK9 variants in
humans have been shown to result in hypercholesterolemia                 or hypocholesterolemia
respectively. For instance, gain-of-function mutations in the PCSK9 gene are associated with
elevated serum LDL-C levels of > 300 mg/dL and premature cardiovascular heart disease
(Abifadel et al Nat. Gent. 2003, 34, p. 154-156).           On the other hand, loss-of-function
mutations in the PCSK9 gene are associated with low serum LDL-C of < 100 mg/dL and a
reduction in cardiovascular heart disease (Cohen et al Nat. Gent. 2005, 37, p. 161-165).
PCSK9 is a serine protease, made primarily by the liver and intestine, and consists of a signal
peptide, a prodomain, a catalytic domain, and the histidine-rich C terminal domain (Piper et
al Structure 2007, 15, p. 545-552). Data has shown that PCSK9 can exert its effects on LDL
C by binding to hepatocyte LDL receptor and preventing it from recycling to the cell surface
after endocytosis. This sequence of events results in reduced LDL receptor levels, decreased
cellular uptake of LDL-C, and higher LDL-C levels in blood (Horton et al J Lip. Res. 2009,
                                                 -1-

   WO 2013/177536                                                           PCT/US2013/042693
50 (Suppl.), p. S172-S177). Neutralizing antibodies to PCSK9 have now been shown to
significantly reduce serum LDL-C in mice and nonhuman primates (Chan et al PNAS 2009,
106, p. 9820-9825; Liang et al Pharmacologyand Experimental Therapeutics 2012, 340, p.
228-236). REGN727, AMG 145, RN316, and LGT209 are some monoclonal antibodies that
are currently being evaluated in human clinical trials for hypercholesterolemia.
[0004]      The statin drug class has been used extensively in the clinic to lower cholesterol.
However, statin treatment has been shown to significantly increase the expression of PCSK9
(Dubuc et al Arterioscler. Thronib. Vasc. 2004, p. 1453-1459).           The increased level of
PCSK9 essentially counteracts some of the beneficial effects of statins since PCSK9
enhances the degradation of LDL receptors, leading to higher plasma levels of LDC-C.
[0005]      Oily cold water fish, such as salmon, trout, herring, and tuna are the source of
dietary marine omega-3 fatty acids, cicosapentacnoic acid (EPA) and docosahexacnoic acid
(DHA) being the key marine derived omega-3 fatty acids. Both niacin and marine omega-3
fatty acids (EPA and DHA) have been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease, coronary
heart disease, atherosclerosis      and reduce mortality in        patients with   dyslipidemia,
hypercholesterolemia, or Type 2 diabetes, and metabolic disease. Niacin at high dose (1.5 to
4 grams per day) has been shown to improve very low-density lipoprotein ("VLDL") levels
through lowering Apolipoprotein B ("ApoB") and raising high density lipoprotein ("HDL")
through increasing Apolipoprotein Al ("ApoAl") in the liver.            Niacin can also inhibit
diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2, a key enzyme for TG synthesis (Kamanna, V. S.; Kashyap,
M. L. Am. J. Cardiol. 2008, 101 (8A), 20B-26B). Unfortunately, niacin has many actions
outside of the liver that detract from its therapeutic utility. The most common side effect of
niacin is flushing, which can limit the dose a patient can tolerate. Flushing is thought to
occur through the GPR109 receptor in the vasculature.
[0006]      Omega-3 fatty acids have previously been shown to improve insulin sensitivity
and glucose tolerance in normoglycemic men and in obese individuals. Omega-3 fatty acids
have also been shown to improve insulin resistance in obese and non-obese patients with an
inflammatory phenotype.       Lipid, glucose, and insulin metabolism have been shown to
improve in overweight hypertensive subjects through treatment with omega-3 fatty acids.
Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA) have also been shown to decrease triglycerides and to
reduce the risk for sudden death caused by cardiac arrhythmias in addition to improve
mortality in patients at risk of a cardiovascular event. Omega-3 fatty acids have also been
taken as dietary supplements part of therapy used to treat dyslipidemia, and anti
inflammatory properties. A higher intake of omega-3 fatty acids lower levels of circulating
                                                 -2-

TNF-a and IL-6, two of the cytokines that are markedly increased during inflammation
processes (Chapkin et al, Prostaglandins,Leukot Essent Fatty Acids 2009, 81, p. 187-191;
Duda et al, CardiovascRes 2009, 84, p. 33-41). In addition, a higher intake of omega-3 fatty
acids has also been shown to increase levels of the well-characterized anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10 (Bradley et al, Obesity (Silver Spring) 2008, 16, p. 938-944). More recently,
DHA has been shown to attenuate kidney disease and prolong the lifespan of autoimmune
lupus-prone mice (Halade et al, J. Immunology 2010, 184, p. 5280-6). Studies have shown
that DHA could potentially suppress glomerulonephritis because of its ability to lower LPS
mediated increase in serum IL-18 as well as its ability to dampen LPS-mediated P13K, Akt
and NF-KB activation in the kidney.
[0007]      Hyperlipidemia are classified according to which types of lipids are elevated, that
is hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or both in combined hyperlipidemia. Elevated
levels of lipoprotein may also be classified as a form of hyperlipidemia. There are five types
of hyperlipoproteinemia (types I through V) and these are further classified according to the
Fredrikson classification, based on the pattern of lipoproteins on electrophoresis or
ultracentrifugation. Type I hyperlipoproteinemia has three subtypes: Type Ta (also called
Buerger-Gruetz syndrome or familial hyperchylomicronemia), Type lb (also called familial
apoprotein CII deficiency) and Type Ic. Due to defects in either decreased in lipoprotein
lipase (LPL), altered ApoC2 or LPL inhibitor in blood, all three subtypes of Type I
hyperlipoproteinemia share the same characteristic increase in chylomicrons. The frequency
of occurrence for Type I hyperlipoproteinemia is 1 in 1,000,000 and thus far no drug therapy
is available and treatment has consisted only of diet. Type II hyperlipoproteinemia has two
subtypes: Type Ila (also called familial hypercholesterolemia) is characterized by an elevated
level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL); and Type Ilb (also called familial combined
hyperlipidemia) is characterized by an elevated level of LDL and very-low density
lipoprotein     (VLDL).     Type    III    hyperlipoproteinemia      (also    called    familial
dysbetalipoproteinemia) is characterized by an elevated level of intermediate-density
lipoprotein     (IDL).      Type     IV    hyperlipoproteinemia       (also   called    familial
hypertriglyceridemia)   is characterized by an elevated level of VLDL.                Type V
hyperlipoproteinemia is characterized by an elevated level of VLDL and chylomicrons.
Treatment for Type V hyperlipoproteinemia thus far has not been adequate with using just
niacin or fibrate.

   WO 2013/177536                                                         PCT/US2013/042693
[0008]      The present invention is directed to overcome the above-described deficiencies in
the treatment of metabolic diseases.
                            SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0009]      The invention is based in part on the discovery of fatty acid derivatives and their
demonstrated effects in achieving improved treatment that cannot be achieved by
administering the omega-3 fatty acid EPA or DHA alone or in combination with other
bioactives. These omega-3 fatty acid derivatives are designed to be stable in the plasma and
absorbed by cells where they inhibit the production or secretion of PCSK9. Inhibiting the
production or secretion of PCSK9 has the effect of reducing plasma cholesterol levels in
animals and humans. In addition, since omega-3 fatty acid derivatives are inhibitors of
PCSK9, they can enhance the efficacy of statins when administered in combination.
[0010]      Accordingly in one aspect, the present invention relates to a method of treating
metabolic diseases. The method involves inhibiting the production or lowering serum levels
of PCSK9 by administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a fatty acid
bioactive derivative. In one embodiment, the fatty acid bioactive derivative comprises a fatty
acid covalently linked to a bioactive molecule, wherein the fatty acid is selected from the
group consisting of omega-3 fatty acids and fatty acids that are metabolized in vivo to omega
3 fatty acids.
[0011]      In another aspect, a method of inhibiting the production of PCSK9 or lowering
serum levels of PCSK9 is provided. The method involves administering to a patient in need
thereof a compound of the Formula I :

                     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0030]       Metabolic diseases are a wide variety of medical disorders that interfere with a
subject's metabolism. Metabolism is the process a subject's body uses to transform food into
energy. Metabolism in a subject with a metabolic disease is disrupted in some way. The
fatty acid derivatives possess the ability to treat or prevent metabolic diseases. The fatty acid
derivatives have been designed to bring together omega-3 fatty acids and an aryl, a heteroaryl
or a heterocycle into a single fatty acid bioactive derivative. In some instances, the heteroaryl
group can also be niacin or any other derivatives thereof.        The activity of the fatty acid
derivatives is substantially greater than the sum of the individual components of the fatty acid
bioactive derivative, suggesting that the activity induced by the fatty acid derivatives is
synergistic. Based on this information, it was conceived that the present fatty acid derivatives
could be effective in lowering the production of PCSK9 in in vitro cell assays. In addition,
these fatty acid derivatives could also lower the serum PCSK9 level when dosed in vivo. As
a result of these activities, fatty acid derivatives can be used as a monotherapy or as a
combination therapy with a statin or other cholesterol lowering agent to effectively treat
hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia or metabolic disease.

COMPOUNDS
[0058]      Accordingly in one aspect, the present invention provides a method of using a
fatty acid bioactive derivative which comprises a fatty acid and an aryl, a heteroaryl or a
heterocycle covalently linked, wherein the fatty acid is selected from the group consisting of
omega-3 fatty acids and fatty acids that are metabolized in vivo to omega-3 fatty acids, and
the derivative is capable of hydrolysis to produce free fatty acid and free aryl, heteroaryl or
heterocycle.
[0059]      In some embodiments, the fatty acid is selected from the group consisting of all
cis-7,10,13-hexadecatrienoic acid, a-linolenic acid, stearidonic acid, eicosatrienoic acid,
eicosatetraenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA), tetracosapentaenoic acid and tetracosahexaenoic acid. In other embodiments,
the fatty acid is selected from eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. In some
embodiments, the hydrolysis is enzymatic.

Methods for using thefatty acid bioactive derivatives
[0177]      The invention also includes methods for treating metabolic diseases such as the
treatment or prevention of metabolic diseases including atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia,
coronary heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, Type 2 diabetes, elevated cholesterol,
metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.

[0178]      In one embodiment, the method involves the inhibition of PCSK9 by fatty acid
derivatives. Inhibition of PCSK9 will lead to a reduction in LDL-C.
[0179]      In one embodiment, the method comprises contacting a cell with a fatty acid
derivative in an amount sufficient to decrease the release of triglycerides or VLDL or LDL or
cause an increase in reverse cholesterol transport or increase HDL concentrations.
[0180]      Also provided in the invention is a method for inhibiting, preventing, or treating a
metabolic disease, or symptoms of a metabolic disease, in a subject. Examples of such
disorders include, but are not limited to atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia,
hypertension, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, low HDL levels, high LDL levels, sudden
death, stable angina, coronary heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, secondary
prevention of myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, endocarditis, type 2 diabetes, insulin
resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, hypercholesterolemia,            stroke, hyperlipidemia,
hyperlipoproteinemia, chronic kidney disease, intermittent claudication, hyperphosphatemia,
carotid     atherosclerosis,     peripheral     arterial    disease,    diabetic    nephropathy,
hypercholesterolemia in HIV infection, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease, arterial occlusive diseases, cerebral arteriosclerosis, cerebrovascular disorders,
myocardial ischemia, and diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Because of the ability of fatty acid
niacin conjugates and other fatty acid conjugates used as PCSK9 inhibitors to lower
cholesterol and triglycerides, they can also be used to treat diseases of the liver such as fatty
liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
[0181]      In some embodiments, the fatty acid niacin conjugates and other fatty acid
conjugates used as PCSK9 inhibitors can be used to treat familial hyperlipidemia.
Hyperlipidemia are classified according to which types of lipids are elevated, that is
hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or both in combined hyperlipidemia. Elevated
levels of lipoprotein may also be classified as a form of hyperlipidemia. There are five types
of hyperlipoproteinemia (types I through V) and these are further classified according to the
Fredrikson classification, based on the pattern of lipoproteins on electrophoresis or
ultracentrifugation. Type I hyperlipoproteinemia has three subtypes: Type Ta (also called
Buerger-Gruetz syndrome or familial hyperchylomicronemia), Type lb (also called familial
apoprotein CII deficiency) and Type Ic. Due to defects in either decreased in lipoprotein
lipase (LPL), altered ApoC2 or LPL inhibitor in blood, all three subtypes of Type I
hyperlipoproteinemia share the same characteristic increase in chylomicrons. The frequency
of occurrence for Type I hyperlipoproteinemia is I in 1,000,000 and thus far treatment has
consisted mainly of diet. Because of the ability of fatty acid niacin conjugates in affecting

postprandial lipids, it can be especially useful in treating Type I hyperlipoproteinemia. Type
11    hyperlipoproteinemia        has   two   subtypes:     Type    Ila (also   called   familial
hypercholesterolemia) is characterized by an elevated level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL);
and Type Ilb (also called familial combined hyperlipidemia) is characterized by an elevated
level of LDL and very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Type III hyperlipoproteinemia
(also called familial dysbetalipoproteinemia) is characterized by an elevated level of
intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL). Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia (also called familial
hypertriglyceridemia)     is characterized by an elevated         level of VLDL.       Type V
hyperlipoproteinemia        is characterized by an elevated level of VLDL and chylomicrons.
Treatment for Type V hyperlipoproteinemia thus far has not been adequate with using just
niacin or fibrate. Because of the ability of fatty acid niacin conjugates in affecting
postprandial lipids, it can be especially useful in treating Type V hyperlipoproteinmia.
[0182]       In some embodiments, the subject is administered an effective amount of a fatty
acid derivative.
[0183]       The invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions useful for treating or
preventing a metabolic disease, or for inhibiting a metabolic disease, or more than one of
these activities. The compositions can be suitable for internal use and comprise an effective
amount of a fatty acid derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The fatty acid
derivatives are especially useful in that they demonstrate very low peripheral toxicity or no
peripheral toxicity.
[0184]       The fatty acid derivatives can each be administered in amounts that are sufficient
to treat or prevent a metabolic disease or prevent the development thereof in subjects.
[0185]       Administration of the fatty acid derivatives can be accomplished via any mode of
administration for therapeutic agents. These modes include systemic or local administration
such as oral, nasal, parenteral, transdermal, subcutaneous, vaginal, buccal, rectal or topical
administration modes.
[0186]       Depending on the intended mode of administration, the compositions can be in
solid, semi-solid or liquid dosage form, such as, for example, injectables, tablets,
suppositories, pills, time-release capsules, elixirs, tinctures, emulsions, syrups, powders,
liquids, suspensions, or the like, sometimes in unit dosages and consistent with conventional
pharmaceutical practices. Likewise, they can also be administered in intravenous (both bolus
and infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or intramuscular form, all using forms well
known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts.

[0187]       Illustrative pharmaceutical    compositions     are tablets and gelatin capsules
comprising a fatty acid niacin derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as:
a) a diluent, e.g., purified water, triglyceride oils, such as hydrogenated or partially
hydrogenated vegetable oil, or mixtures thereof, corn oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, safflower
oil, fish oils, such as EPA or DHA, or their esters or triglycerides or mixtures thereof, omega

sodium, saccharin, glucose and/or glycine; b) a lubricant, e.g., silica, talcum, stearic acid, its
magnesium or calcium salt, sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium
benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and/or polyethylene glycol; for tablets also; c) a
binder, e.g., magnesium aluminum silicate, starch paste, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose,
sodium carboxymethylcellulose, magnesium carbonate, natural sugars such as glucose or
beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or
sodium alginate, waxes and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone, if desired; d) a disintegrant, e.g.,
starches, agar, methyl cellulose, bentonite, xanthan gum, alginic acid or its sodium salt, or
effervescent mixtures; e) absorbent, colorant, flavorant and sweetener; f) an emulsifier or
dispersing agent, such as Tween 80, Labrasol, HPMC, DOSS, caproyl 909, labrafac, labrafil,
peceol, transcutol, capmul MCM, capmul PG-12, captex 355, gelucire, vitamin E TGPS or
other acceptable emulsifier; and/or g) an agent that enhances absorption of the compound
such as cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin, PEG400, PEG200.
[0188]       Liquid, particularly injectable, compositions can, for example, be prepared by
dissolution, dispersion, etc. For example, the fatty acid niacin derivative is dissolved in or
mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent such as, for example, water, saline,
aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form an injectable isotonic
solution or suspension. Proteins such as albumin, chylomicron particles, or serum proteins
can be used to solubilize the fatty acid niacin derivatives.
[0189]       The fatty acid derivatives can be also formulated as a suppository that can be
prepared from fatty emulsions or suspensions; using polyalkylene glycols such as propylene
glycol, as the carrier.
[0190]       The fatty acid derivatives can also be administered in the form of liposome
delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and
multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, containing
cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.       In some embodiments, a film of lipid
components is hydrated with an aqueous solution of drug to a form lipid layer encapsulating

the drug, as described in United States Patent No. 5,262,564, the contents of which are herein
incorporated by reference in their entirety.
[0191]      Fatty acid derivatives can also be delivered by the use of monoclonal antibodies as
individual carriers to which the fatty acid derivatives are coupled. The fatty acid derivatives
can also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can
include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide-phenol,
polyhydroxyethylaspanamidephenol,         or  polyethyleneoxidepolylysine     substituted  with
palmitoyl residues.    Furthermore, the fatty acid derivatives can be coupled to a class of
biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example,
polylactic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters,
polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block
copolymers of hydrogels. In one embodiment, fatty acid derivatives are not covalently bound
to a polymer, e.g., a polycarboxylic acid polymer, or a polyacrylate.
[0192]      Parenteral   injectable administration is generally used for subcutaneous,
intramuscular or intravenous injections and infusions.         Injectables can be prepared in
conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions or solid forms suitable for
dissolving in liquid prior to injection.
[0193]      Compositions can be prepared according to conventional mixing, granulating or
coating methods, respectively, and the present pharmaceutical compositions can contain from
about 0.1 % to about 90 %, from about 10 % to about 90 %, or from about 30 % to about 90
% of the fatty acid derivative by weight or volume.
[0194]      The dosage regimen utilizing the fatty acid derivative is selected in accordance
with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the
patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal or
hepatic function of the patient; and the particular fatty acid niacin derivative employed. A
physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the
effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the
condition.
[0195]      Effective dosage amounts of the present invention, when used for the indicated
effects, range from about 20 mg to about 5,000 mg of the fatty acid derivative per day.
Compositions for in vivo or in vitro use can contain about 20, 50, 75, 100, 150, 250, 500, 750,
1,000, 1,250, 2,500, 3,500, or 5,000 mg of the fatty acid derivative. In one embodiment, the
compositions are in the form of a tablet that can be scored. Effective plasma levels of the
fatty acid niacin derivative can range from 5 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL. Appropriate dosages of

[0210]      The amine T can be prepared from the commercially available diamine according
to the procedures outlined in Dahan et al. J. Org. Chem. 2007, 72, 2289-2296. Compound A
can be amidated with the amine T using a coupling reagent such as DCC, CDI, EDC, or
optionally with a tertiary amine base and/or catalyst, e.g., DMAP, to afford compound U.
The BOC group of compound U can be removed with acids such as TFA or HCl in a solvent
such as CH 2 Cl 2 or dioxane and the resulting amine can be coupled with a fatty acid of
formula D using HATU in the presence of an amine such as DIEA to afford compounds of
the formula V. To those skilled in the art, the hydroxyl group in compound U can be further
acylated or converted to an amino group by standard mesylation chemistry followed by
displacement with sodium azide and hydrogenation over a catalyst such as Pd/C. The amine
can be further acylated or alkylated, followed by the removal of the BOC group. The
resulting amine can be coupled with a fatty acid of the formula D to afford compounds of the
formula W.

       Effect of fatty acid derivatives on ApoAl and ApoB secretion in HepG2 cells
[0215]      Niacin has been reported to increase serum levels of HDL to LDL cholesterol in
vivo. Similarly, niacin has been reported to increase the secretion of ApoAl (Jin, F- Y. et al.
Arterioscler. Thronb. Vase. Biol. 1997, 17 (10), 2020-2028) while inhibiting the secretion of
ApoB (Jin, F- Y. et al. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vase. Biol. 1999, 19, 1051-1059) in the media
supernatants of HepG2 cultures. Independently, DHA has been demonstrated to lower ApoB
as well (Pan, M. et al. J. Clin. Invest. 2004, 113, 1277-1287) by a very different mechanism.
Thus, the secretion of ApoAl and ApoB from HepG2 cells possesses utility as a cell based
read-out for niacin-DHA derivative small molecules.
[0216]      HepG2 cells (ATCC) are seeded at 10,000 cells per well in 96 well plates. After
adhering overnight, growth media (10% FBS in DMEM) is removed and cells are serum
starved for 24 hours in DMEM containing 0.1% fatty acid free bovinc serum albumin
(Sigma).   Cells are then treated with the compounds at 6 concentrations (2 fold dilutions
starting at 100 tM). Niacin at 1.5 mM is used as a positive control. All treatments are
performed in triplicate.      Simultaneous with compound treatment, ApoB secretion is
stimulated with addition of 0.1 oleate complexed to fatty acid free BSA in a 5:1 molar ratio.
Incubation with compounds and oleate is conducted for 24 hours. Media supernatants are
removed and ApoAl and ApoB concentrations are measured using ELISA kits (Mabtech
AB). ApoAl is expressed as a percent increase over vehicle (0.1% ethanol) treated wells.
Percent inhibition of ApoB secretion is determined by normalizing data to vehicle treated
wells. For a given compound, an IC 50 (concentration at which 50% of ApoB secretion is
inhibited) is determined by using a 4 parameter-fit inhibition curve model (Graph Pad

                 Effect of the compounds of the invention in the PCSK9 assay
Cell Culture
[0217]       HepG2 cells (from ATCC, Catalog no. HB-8065) were maintained in DMEM
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The day prior to the
PCSK9 assay, cells are seeded in 96-well collagen coated plates at 25,000 cells/well.
Compound Preparation
[0218]       The compounds of the invention were stored at -20'C until used. The test article
compound was dissolved in 100% ethanol to a 50mM stock solution. This was then diluted
in FBS to a final concentration of 1mM. This solution was placed in a sonicating water bath
for 30 minutes.       Subsequent dilutions were then made in FBS supplemented with an
equivalent volume of ethanol and mixed by vortexing.
PCSK9 Secretion Assay
[0219]       HepG2 cells were seeded onto a collagen coated 96-well plate (Becton Dickinson,
Catalog no. 35-4407) the day prior to the assay, as described above. The next day, the cell
medium was removed, washed once with 100puL serum free DMEM to remove any residual
PCSK9, and replaced with 90gL of serum free DMEM. Ten microliters of each compound
concentration prepared in FBS was then added. Each concentration of compound was tested
in triplicate. The compound was incubated with the cells overnight for 16 hours. Following
this incubation, 10pL of AlamarBlue was added to each well and cells incubated for another
2 hours.      The plates were then removed and AlamarBlue fluorescence was measured
(excitation, 550nm and excitation, 590nm) to assess cell viability. Cell culture supernatant
was then diluted 1:5 in 1:5 in 1x RD5P Calibrator Diluent and PCSK9 ELISA was then
performed with 50pL of this diluted sample, as per the manufacturer's instructions. The
ELISA was measured on a Victor X5 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer) at an absorbance
of 450nm with background correction measured at 550nm (The PCSK9 Elisa kits can be
purchased from R&D System, Catalog no. DPC900).

(5Z,8Z, 1IZ, 14Z,17Z)-N-(2-acetamidoethyl)icosa-5,8,11,14,17-pentaenamide          (Compound
A). As summarized in Figure 1, compounds 1-8 and 11-1 were active in this assay and both
compounds showed significant lowering of PCSK9 at 25 and 50 pM. Compound A, with a
simple acetate group instead of the aryl or heteroaryl group niacin, showed essentially no
activity toward PCSK9 at the highest tested concentration of 50 tM.
[0221]      Alternatively, an IC 50 could also be obtained when this type of assay was carried
out using at least 6 different concentrations of the test compounds. Table 1 lists the IC 50
values for the compounds tested in this assay. In table 1, a ++ value denotes ICso of < 25 pM;
a + value denotes IC 50 that is >25 pM but < 50 pM; a - value denotes IC50 that is > 50gM.
[0222]      Figure 2 summarizes an experiment that demonstrates the synergy of the fatty acid
niacin derivative in the same HepG2 assay. HepG2 cells were incubated with 10 pM of
atorvastatin along with either compound 1-8 or a combination of EPA and niacin. As shown
in Figure 2, atorvastatin increases PCSK9 secretion. Compound 1-8 decrease PCSK9 levels
in a dose response manner to well below the atorvastatin level induced levels.             The
combination of EPA and niacin did not have a similar effect.

              The effect of lowering plasma triglycerides after a high fat meal
[0223]      In this experiment, healthy human volunteers are divided into 4 treatment groups.
The first treatment group is a placebo group (n = 6). The other three groups consists of the
test compound, a fatty acid niacin conjugate, administered as a single oral dose at either 300

mg (n   = 6), 1000 mg (n   = 7) or 2000 mg (n     = 4). All subjects are given an NIH high fat
breakfast in order to induce an elevated level of triglycerides (In a typical NIH high fat
breakfast, 450 calories are derived from fat). The test compound is then administered as a
single oral dose at the three indicated doses at three different time points: immediately
following the high fat meal, 2 hours following the high fat meal and 4 hours following the
high fat meal. At each of the time points, plasma triglyceride levels can be determined
according to standard protocols. Test compound that lowers the plasma triglyceride level at
these various time points is useful for the treatment of type I hyperlipoproteinemia and type 5
hyperlipoproteinemia.

    The effect of the compounds of the invention on the plasma triglyceride level of the
                          Zucker fa/fa Rat Model of Dyslipidemia
[0224]      Male Zucker rats (HsdHlr:Zucker- Lepr~fa) between 8-10 weeks of age were
purchased from Harlan and maintained on Purina Rodent Diet (5001) for the duration
of the study. Animals were randomized and assigned to treatment arms based on body
weight and plasma triglyceride (TG) levels (n           = 8). Inclusion criteria for the study
include body weight > 300 grams and fed TG levels in plasma > 800 mg/dL. Dosing
will be initiated on day 1 and continue through day 5. Dosing will be daily (qd) by oral
gavage (po) for all treatment arms (Compound 1-8 was administered orally at 4 different
doses, 10, 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg; in addition, a combination of niacin/EPA in a ratio of
100/200 mg/kg was also employed).        Body weights will be measured for all rats on days 1
through 5. On day 4, a blood sample (fed) will be collected from each rat, processed for
plasma and stored at -800 C. Plasma triglyceride level was determined from commercial kits
using standard protocols.     Figure 3 showed the dose dependent decrease of fed plasma
triglyceride level upon oral administration of compound 1-8. As shown in figure 3, this effect
could not be replicated by a simple combination of niacin and EPA. Because compound 1-8
was able to lower fed plasma triglyceride, it is useful to treat dyslipidemia as well as other
diseases such as type I hyperlipoproteinemia and type 5 hyperlipoproteinemia.

The effect of a combination of compound 1-8 and atorvastatin on plasma cholesterol and
                              other lipids in ApoE3Leiden mice.
[0225]      The study was conducted using female APOE*3Lciden mice (groups of each
n=10) and one untreated reference control group on chow (n=5). To induce dyslipidemia, a
high cholesterol Western type diet containing 1% cholesterol, 15% cacao butter, 40.5%
sucrose and 1% corn oil (WTD) was fed to the mice for a total experimental period of 20
weeks (of which 4 weeks are a run-in period). To prevent oxidation of the test compound (I
8), 30 mg/kg alpha-tocopherol was added to the high cholesterol diets, i.e. also in the high
cholesterol diet control.
[0226]      In the first 4 weeks (run-in period), a pro-atherogenic state of dyslipidemia
characterized by elevated plasma cholesterol levels (about 15-20 mM) was induced in all
mice by feeding them an atherogenic diet containing 1% cholesterol. The mice were then
separated into a control group (no treatment) and three treatment groups: i) compound 1-8, ii)
atorvastatin and iii) compound 1-8+atorvastatin as as described below.       The dyslipidemic
mice were grouped on the basis of plasma cholesterol at t=0 assayed in 4h fasting blood.
Mice with low cholesterol after the run-in period were excluded so that homogenous
experimental groups were obtained. A group of reference mice (n=5) remained on a chow
diet during the complete study period (normolipidemic reference mice).
[0227]      The doses of the test compounds were as follows:
    -       Compound 1-8: 0.75% w/w in diet.
    -       Atorvastatin: 0.0015% w/w in diet (to achieve about 20% reduction in plasma
        cholesterol).
    -       Alpha-tocopherol: 0.0030% w/w in diet
[0228]      The test compounds, sufficient for approx. 3 kg of diet (i.e. 25 g of compound I
8), and alpha-tocopherol (>200 mg) were formulated before the start of the treatment period
(t=0), by adding the test compounds to melted, hand warm cocoa butter and mixed for 5 min.
This mix was then added to the master mix (containing the rest of the ingredients) and mixed
thoroughly. The diet was frozen to -20 0 C. On the subsequent day, the diet was broken into
small pellets (approx 5 g per piece) and freeze dried, and stored in vacuum sealed bags

(approx 500g) at -20'C until use. The diets were refreshed daily and unused diet was
discarded.
[0229]      The following parameters were taken at the indicated timepoints (individually
unless mentioned otherwise):
1)          Body weight at -4, 0, 2, 4 weeks
2)          Food intake (g/day/mouse) at 0, 2, 4 weeks (per cage)
3)          Plasma total cholesterol at -4, 0, 2, 4 weeks (individually)
4)          Plasma triglycerides at -4, 0, 2, 4 weeks (individually)
5)          Lipoprotein profiles at 0 (pool of all animals) and 4 weeks (cholesterol
distribution over VLDL, LDL and HDL-sized particles, analysis on group level).
[0230]      EDTA plasma was collected in weeks -4, 0, 2 and 4 weeks. Plasma cholesterol,
plasma triglyceride levels and lipoprotein profileswere assayed immediately in fresh plasma.
Figure 4 shows the cholesterol level at t = 2 weeks of treatment between the control group,
the group treated with compound 1-8, the group treated with atorvastatin, and the group
treated with a combination of compound 1-8 and atorvastatin. There was a statistically
significant reduction of plasma cholesterol at t = 2 weeks for groups treated with either
compound 1-8 and atorvastatin. The group treated with the combination of compound 1-8
and atorvastatin showed a more substantial decrease in plasma cholesterol.
Figures 5 and 6 show the plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels respectively after 4 weeks
of treatment. As shown in Figure 5, the reduction in plasma cholesterol level was maintained
after 4 weeks of treatment across all treatment groups. Comparable level of cholesterol
reduction was observed in groups treated with either compound 1-8 or atorvastatin. A
significant reduction in plasma cholesterol was observed in the groups treated with a
combination of compound 1-8 and atorvastatin.
[0231]      Figure 6 shows the corresponding plasma triglyceride levels in the same treatment
groups after 4 weeks of treatment. ApoE*3 Leiden mice treated with compound 1-8 showed
a significant reduction in triglycerides after 4 weeks of treatment. In sharp contrast, ApoE*3
Leiden mice treated with atorvastatin failed to show a statistically significant change
triglyceride level after 4 weeks of treatment.           ApoE*3 Leiden mice treated with a
combination of compound 1-8 and atorvastatin showed a significant reduction in plasma
triglycerides after 4 weeks of treatment.

      The effect administering compound 1-8 on liver weight of ApoE*3 Leiden mice
[0232]      The same experimental design used in example 6 was used. Two treatment groups
were used (n = 15). The control animals were kept on a Western type diet (WTD) consisting
of 1% cholesterol, 15% cacao butter, 40.5% sucrose, and 1% corn oil. For the treatment
group, compound 1-8 was administered in the above WTD at a ratio of 7.5 g/kg. Animals
were maintained on the WTD or treatment group for 16 weeks. At the conclusion of the
study, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were recorded, as well as the weight of the
liver. There was a significant decrease in plasma cholesterol, triglyceride levels as well as
liver weight in the treatment group. After 16 weeks of treatment, the cholesterol level of the
treatment group was 420 mg/dL, compared with a level of 750 mg/dL for the control group;
the triglyceride level was 110 mg/dL, compared with a level of 160 mg/dL for the control
group. The statistically significant drop in liver weight is shown in Figure 7.
