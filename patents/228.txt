                                           ABSTRACT
Apparatus     and    methods         for bone      fracture      repair.        The      apparatus
may  include       a structural          support      for positioning            a    first    bone
segment   relative         to     a   second    bone      segment.       The    apparatus       may
include an anchoring substrate. The                        anchoring substrate may be
configured      to    compress         the  first       bone    segment        to    the     second
bone   segment.       The       anchoring        substrate       may      transmit          tension
from a distal bone segment anchor in the                          first bone          segment to
a proximal bone         segment anchor            in the     second bone segment. The
apparatus     may    be     configured        to    be    deployed       percutaneously          in
an  inner   cavity       of     a   bone.   The     apparatus       may     be    installed      in
an   open     fracture.            The    apparatus         may    be      expanded,          self
expanding       or    configured           for      mechanically           actuation.          Some
embodiments       of the apparatus may include a central axis member
that may be used in conjunction with expansion of                                   one or both
of   the   structural             support     and      the    anchoring          substrate       to
configure the apparatus.

FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY
 [01a]      Aspects      of    the     disclosure           relate        to    providing           apparatus
and     methods      for      repairing          bone      fractures.            In    particular,           the
disclosure        relates        to     apparatus         and      methods         for   repairing         bone
fractures utilizing a device that                           is inserted into a bone.
BACKGROUND
 [02]     Currently,        there       are     many      known        ways      to   treat        long    bone
fractures.        Common        fracture        treatments            include:         (1) non-surgical
immobilization;             (2)     osteosuture           and      tension         band     technologies;
 (3)     percutaneous           fixation           (e.g.,        using        pins,       wires,        screws
etc.);       (4) rigid intramedullary nailing                            (e.g., using a large rod
and external screws);                  (5) flexible plate osteosynthesis                              (e.g., a
"load        sharing"         suture);            (6)     arthroplasty                (e.g.,         using      a
prosthesis);              (7)        plating          and          other         indication-specific
techniques. Severe fractures that meet certain clinical criteria
may        require         surgical            repair           rather           than         non-surgical
immobilization.

                                                    -   2
 [03]     The      midshaft        of    an    elongated           or      long      bone       is      typically
classified            as   the       diaphysis.              The        end      of      such        a     bone       is
typically            classified             as     the       epiphysis.                     Bone          that        is
transitional             between         the    midshaft            and      the       end     is       typically
classified as the metaphysis.
 [04]     Metaphysis         and      epiphysis          bone       are      typically             less       dense,
more       cancellous           (porous),          and     less         cortical            than        diaphysis
bone.        Repair of metaphysis                   and epiphysis                 fractures are                 often
complicated            by   their       proximity          to      a    joint.           Because            of    such
bone       quality       and      anatomical          differences,                 fixation            of     plates
and screws           in metaphysis and epiphysis bone is                                     typically more
difficult           than     fixation           of    plates          and       screws         in       diaphysis
bone.         This may be especially                     true if            the patient              is     elderly
and suffers           from osteoporosis.
 [05]     In     general,        fracture         fixation            may      provide           longitudinal
 (along        the    long      axis       of    the      bone),           transverse              (across          the
long      axis      of   the     bone),        and    rotational               (about         the       long      axis
of    the     bone)      stability.             Fracture           fixation may also preserve
normal biologic and healing function.
 [06]     There      are    two     primary         categories              for     surgical            fixation:
 (1) a device that                is within the skin                     (internal fixation);                       and
 (2)      a     device        that        extends          out         of      the        skin           (external
fixation).             There       are     two    common          types        of     internal            fixation
approaches           for    long bone          surgery          (a)      a   plate        that       is     screwed
to    the     outside       of     the bone;          or     (b)      a    rod     that       goes        down      the
center of the bone.
 [07]     Plates        and        screws        are       characterized                    by        relatively
invasive surgery, support of                          fractured bone segments from one
side      outside        of   bone,       and     screws         that        anchor         into        the     plate

                                                        - 3
and     through       the      entire          bone.          Successful             repair          is    dependent
on    fracture        pattern,             bone       quality,            physician            skill         set,        and
patient         tolerance          of     a    foreign           body.           Plates        and       screws          may
not properly address                      the alignment                 and stability requirements
for periarticular and intrarticular fractures.
[08]     Intramedullary                rods       or     nails,         such      as     those         used       in     mid
shaft        treatments,            are     more        effective              than     plates           and      screws
at    minimizing           soft-tissue               trauma          and      complications.                  However,
rods     and nails often do not                          stabilize multi-segment fractures
in    many       cases.           The      typical           intramedullary                 rod         or     nail        is
fixed       in   diameter          and      is      introduced             into      the medullary                   canal
through         an   incision.                 In     cases        where         there        is       a   medullary
plenum          larger         than         the         rod,         rotational               and         transverse
stability          may      be      compromised.                     If      a    larger          rod       is       used,
reaming         of   the      entire          shaft        length          may      be    necessary.                   Such
reaming        may    thin        out      existing            cortical           bone      support.                 Also,
predetermined            threaded             screw        holes        in     the     rods may            limit         the
ways      in    which      different             fracture           patterns           can be           reduced          and
stabilized.
[09]     Flexible            intramedullary                      rod-like             solutions                 utilize
structures          that        can       be      inserted             into      the      medullary               cavity
through         an  access          site,        which        can       then      become         rigid.              These
solutions          may     be     easier           for     the       user       to    install            than        rigid
intramedullary rods.                       These structures may be reinforced with
polymers          or     cements.                  Flexible             intramedullary                    solutions,
similar          to    rigid           intramedullary                    rods,         may        have          limited
benefits           for        periarticular                     or       intrarticular                    fractures.
Multi-segment             fractures,               of    either         the      midshaft           or     end-bone,
require         alignment           and       stability             in     a    manner         that        generates
adequate fixation in multiple directions.

[010]               Midshaft            fractures             and       end-bone          fractures            are
fundamentally               different.                 The     loading        conditions,            fracture
patterns,           alignment           needed,         and     compression           force      to promote
healing         are      different.                Midshaft         fractures          have      ample       bone
material         on     either        side       of    the    fracture         in    which      anchors        may
be    driven.            End-bone           fractures,           especially           on   the     articular
surface         may      have       thin       cortical         bone,       soft      cancellous           bone,
and minimal anchoring locations.
[011]               Midshaft          fractures            tend     to    be     loaded      primarily           in
bending and torsion.                        End-bone fractures tend to be loaded in
complex          and       multi-directional                    stress        patterns.             Midshaft
repair        approaches,                therefore,            may      not      be    appropriate             for
repair of end-bone fractures.
[012]               Appropriate             sizing         of   an    implant        helps      realignment
and     healing          of     the      fracture.              As    a   result,        many      different
sizes         of        known         repair           products           are       often        stored          in
inventories             to     ensure        proper         matching        of     the   implant         device
to    a   patient's            anatomy.             The     inventories           may    be    a   burden        to
hospitals           and      insurance           carriers,          but     they      may    be    necessary
to provide to a surgeon intraoperative flexibility.
[013]               It      would         be       desirable,            therefore,             to     provide
apparatus             and      methods           for       proper        anatomic         alignment            and
stabilization, while reducing trauma and complications.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[092]       Apparatus        and      methods      for     fracture     repair     are
provided.     The apparatus may include a structural                     support for
positioning    a  first      bone      segment    relative      to  a   second    bone
segment.      The    structural          support    may     be  configured      to  be

                                               -    12
deployed      in    an    inner      cavity         of   a   bone.           The   apparatus          may
include an        anchoring substrate.                    The     anchoring         substrate may
be     configured        to    compress          the     first        bone      segment         to    the
second       bone     segment.               The       anchoring            substrate          may      be
configured to be deployed in the inner cavity.
[093]          The    term       "bone      segment"         may      refer      to    portions         or
fragments        of    a    bone.          The       term     "structural            support"         may
include a "structural               cage."
[094]          The    structural          support        may     be     self-expanding.               The
structural         support          may      be       expanded           by     balloon.              The
structural        support        may   be      expanded        by     mechanical           actuation.
The     anchoring substrate may be self-expanding.                                  The     anchoring
substrate      may be       expanded by balloon.                      The     anchoring support
may be expanded by mechanical actuation.
[095]          The    structural            support       may      be    used     as     a   frame      to
position      and    align        the   bone       segments.             Anchors       may    used      to
secure      the   bone      segments          to     the    anchoring          substrate.             The
anchoring        substrate         may     be     tensioned          to     compress         the     bone
segments       against         each       other.            Some         embodiments           of     the
apparatus       may     include       a     central        axis      member.           The     central
axis      member may be          used    in     conjunction          with expansion              of   one
or      both     of     the       structural            support           and     the       anchoring
substrate.             The       central          axis      member          may      be      used       in
conjunction         with     the     tensioning           of     the      anchoring         substrate
after      anchors     are placed.              A proximal           anchor      may be        used     to
fix     one  end    of   the      apparatus          to  a   bone       segment      to     "lock     in"
the tensioning of the anchoring substrate.
[096]          The    apparatus         may      include       delivery         apparatus.            The
delivery      apparatus          may    deliver         one    or     more     portions         of    the

                                             -   13
apparatus,         such     as  the   structural         support         and      the    anchoring
substrate,         through      an   access       hole   in     the    bone        and    into      the
intramedullary             cavity    in     the     bone.         The      portions          may     be
delivered        in    a   contracted       or    collapsed       state.           The    portions
may then be expanded for repair of the fracture.
[097]           The      apparatus      and       methods      may       involve         reducing,
aligning,         compressing        and/or        stabilizing         the        fracture        from
within       the     intramedullary          cavity.         In     some       instances,           the
resulting         stabilized       bone      may     then     heal       while       maintaining
mobility of the patient.
[098]           The     apparatus     and methods may provide stabilization
in    axial     bending,        torsion,         rotation,        compression,             and      may
provide inter-segment tension or compression.
[099]           The     stabilization may repair compacted and impacted
fractures,          control       length,        and    control          alignment          of      the
fracture       segments.          The   apparatus        may     separate          the    tasks      of
revision,         reduction,        fixation,         stabilization,               rotation         and
offset.
[0100]          The       apparatus       and      methods        may      distribute             load
between       the     apparatus      and     native      bone.           The      apparatus         may
have flexibility and modulus that                      are    similar to native bone.
Some       embodiments        may   provide        apparatus        that       is    selectively
weaker       than      or    stronger      than      the    native         bone       to    promote
beneficial fracture healing response.
[0101]          The      apparatus     and      methods     may      be     used      for     closed
reduction,          open     reduction,        and    minimally          invasive          surgical
procedures          ("MIS") .     The   apparatus and methods may facilitate
arthroscopic          surgical procedures.               The     apparatus           and methods
may     provide       percutaneous        fracture       repair.            In     such     repair,

                                              -    14
the   apparatus         may     be     deployed         into     the     cavity        of    a  bone
through a small incision.
[0102]         The     apparatus         may      be    delivered        at      a   point     other
than   that      of   the    fracture         site.        This     may    help       reduce    soft
tissue      damage.          The       apparatus         may     be     delivered          into   an
intramedullary cavity through a small                           access hole that may be
placed      along     the    midshaft          of     the   long     bone       in    an   area   in
which minimal soft tissues would need to be displaced.
[0103]         The     apparatus         and     methods       may     reduce        the   need   to
place    foreign       bodies       in   muscle,        tendon      and    nerve       areas.     As
such, the        apparatus and methods may reduce tissue erosion and
disintegration.             Preservation            of    the   soft     tissue        may    reduce
chronic      pain     and   stiffness.              The    apparatus         and      methods    may
reduce infection risk because of its noninvasiveness.
[0104]          In   some    embodiments,             the   apparatus         and     methods    may
be  made     completely         from biologically              friendly         metals      such  as
titanium       and    Nitinol.            Such      materials         reduce        the    risk   of
infection          and    do      not       generally          interfere            with      normal
biological processes within the fractured bone.
[0105]         The     apparatus          and     methods      may      be    used      to    repair
many   different         types       of   bones.          For    example,          the   apparatus
and  methods        may    be    used      to    repair      long     bones,        short     bones,
flat bones, irregular bones, and sesamoid bones.
[0106]         The     apparatus          and     methods      may      be    used      to    repair
many     different         types         of     fractures.              For        example,      the
apparatus         and    methods         may      be     used      to    repair         comminuted
fractures,         epiphyseal          fractures,         metaphyseal           fractures,       mid
shaft      fractures,          intra-articular               fractures,            periarticular
fractures, multipart fractures and other types of fractures.

[0107]             The     apparatus         may be        used      in    the     reconstruction              of
fractured            joints.             The      apparatus             and      methods         may         also
facilitate            such    joint        replacements             by    providing           an   adequate
anchoring          substrate.             For    example,          the     apparatus          and methods
may      provide         stable       anchoring           for      a    prosthesis,            and     reduce
aseptic loosening.
[0108]             The    terms      "end-bone"           and "end-bone               fracture" may be
used       to   refer       to   fractures           that       occur       in    the      epiphyseal          or
metaphyseal             region       of     long      bones.            Such      fractures          include
peri-articular and intra-articular fractures.
[0109]             The      apparatus           and     methods          may     be      used     to      treat
osteoporotic             bone,      indications             involving           poor       bone    quality.
In      connection           with        such        indications,              the        apparatus           may
compensate            for    deficiencies              in     native        bone        and    may     reduce
concerns           regarding          stress         shielding.                 The       apparatus           and
methods        may      be   used      in     connection           with       fusion        of   bones        and
joints for various indications                            including arthritis.
[0110]             The       apparatus            and        methods            may        be     used         in
conjunction            with bone         cement        or    in   place        of bone        cement.          In
some       embodiments,           the       apparatus           may     act      as     a   bone     filler.
For     example,         the   apparatus          may be         used      for     filling       bone void
in     connection           with    the      treatment           of     cysts      and      tumors.           The
apparatus            may     behave          as      an     osteoconductive                  scaffold          to
promote bone growth.
[0111]             The    apparatus and methods may be used in                                  connection
with provisional               alignment          for      staged repair procedures,                         such
as     revisions,           high     energy         trauma,         or    other         cases     in      which
there       is    infection         or     soft     tissue        that      needs        to   heal     before
bone fixation is               completed.              The apparatus and methods may be

                                                     -   16
used        in    combination             with      various         antibiotics             that      promote
healing.
[0112]              The      structural          support         may     prevent          bone      segments
from         moving          inward,         so       the       apparatus           may       reduce        the
likelihood             of    collapse         of    the     fracture.             The      apparatus        may
conform          to      the    shape       of    bone       and      may     thus      minimize          undue
stresses.              For    example,         the      apparatus        and      methods may           reduce
hoop       stress         by    selecting          a     degree       of    implant         expansion        or
stiffness.
[0113]                  The     apparatus         may      be    self-centering,               because       it
expands          into      the bone        cavity.           Many      of    the     cavities        are    not
straight           like      a    pipe;      they        vary     depending           on    the     anatomy.
The       apparatus           may      be    straight,           bent,       curved,          and     cavity
compliant.
[0114]              The     apparatus         and      methods        may provide            anchoring       at
the      distal         end    of    the     apparatus.             This       feature        may    be    used
for      repairs          of   articular         fractures           and     fractures         with       small
or mobile bone segments.
[0115]              The     apparatus         and      methods        may     provide         for    the    use
of     small        anchors,         because        the     apparatus           provides        structural
support for the bone segments that require anchoring.
[0116]              The     apparatus         and      methods        may provide            anchoring       in
any        suitable           direction.                 Some       embodiments              may      provide
anchoring in any plane.
[0117]              Because         the    anchoring          substrate          expands       toward       the
inside          surface          of      the    bone        segments,            relatively           shorter
anchors           may       be     used       in       comparison          with        typical          repair
methods.              For     the     same     reason,         the     use      of   a    screw      that    is

                                               -   17
longer      than      required        to   engage       the     anchoring            substrate         will
not  result        in    driving       the   screw       into     or through            bone     that     is
opposite        the    anchored        segment.         This      is   so because              the    screw
will terminate             in the intramedullary cavity.
[0118]           The        apparatus         and       methods           may          be      used       in
conjunction           with       plates,      screws,         pins,       external             fixators,
replacement           joints,       bone     graft       matrices,           factor         based      bone
substitutes, and cell based bone substitutes.
Delivery Instrument
[0119]           The     delivery        instrument          may     deliver           the     apparatus
to  the      intramedullary             cavity      through         an    access          hole     in    the
bone.        The      delivery        instrument          may     be     used         to    remove       the
apparatus        from       the    intramedullary            cavity       through           the     access
hole.        The     delivery        instrument         may      engage         the     apparatus         by
any suitable mechanism, including one                              or more of threading, a
socket,       a   pin,        a   snap,     a    collet,        a    cable,          and      any     other
suitable mechanism.
[0120]           The     mechanism        may    deliver,         expand,          adjust,       rotate,
lock, release and recapture                     the apparatus.                 Each of the            acts,
and   other       suitable         acts,     may     be     performed            independently            on
the   structural            cage,     the   anchor        substrate,            the      central       axis
member, locking features,                   and associated coupling mechanisms.
The    delivery          device       may     include        a     handle         set      capable        of
delivering          the       forces     needed        to    actuate           the      mechanism         or
mechanisms.
[0121]           The      delivery        instrument          may     include            a    sheath      to
help    deliver         the     apparatus       in    a   compacted           state.           The    shaft
of   sheath         may       be    bendable         to     access        the         intramedullary
cavity.         In some embodiments, the delivery instrument may not

                                                -  18
have a sheath.               In those embodiments,                  the delivery instrument
may push the apparatus into place unguarded.
[0122]           The      delivery          instrument          may      be     radio         opaque      in
whole or in part.
[0123]           In some embodiments,                 the delivery instrument may be
attached          to     a     flexible         scope        or      endoscope.                  In     some
embodiments,            the    delivery        instrument           may     be     integrated           with
the flexible scope or endoscope.
Structural Support
[0124]           The     structural          support       may      provide         one     or    more    of
axial,       bending,        torsional,         and    positional            structural            support
to     the    fracture       segments.          The     structural           support may reduce
or     eliminate         adverse         effects       such      as     stress         risers.           The
structural           support         may      provide         a     guide        or      surface         for
alignment          of     the       fracture       segments           during          reduction          and
healing.
[0125]           The      structural           support         may      be      configured            in    a
contracted         state       and      introduced        through         a   hole      in     the    shaft
of     the     bone.         The     structural          support          may     have       sufficient
flexibility          in     the     contracted        state        to    conform         to    curvature
in an access pathway.
[0126]           The     structural          support may be positioned inside the
intramedullary             cavity        near    a  fracture          site.          The     structural
support         may     be     expanded.           When        expanded,            the      structural
support may be rigid.                     The   structural          support may be expanded
sufficiently to fill the                     available cavity and/or displace                            low
density        material        that      may   border       the      cavity.           Expansion         may
vary       along    the      surface        of   the    structural            support         such      that

the    expanded          structural      support           may        conform          to      irregular
cavity shapes.
[0127]           In     some   embodiments,             an      expansion            state         may      be
maintained with            or  without      the      structural            support          being       in    a
stressed condition.              Radial pressure against the cavity walls
can   be    tailored        along  the      length         of     the     structural             support.
The   structural          support   may        provide         strain        relief         in     desired
locations to promote healing.
[0128]           The     expansion      of      the       structural             support           may      be
elastic.          This    may  be  achieved            using       a   spring        material            that
returns      to its original          configuration shape                     or pressure              after
release from the contracted state.
[0129]           The     expansion      of      the       structural             support           may      be
plastic.           The     structural        support          may      be       deformed           into       a
desired        expanded       configuration.                   The      deformation                may      be
achieved        by    a   mechanism,       such        as    a     lever        or     reciprocating
manipulators            that    change         the       length           of      the        structural
support.          The    lever  or manipulators                 may    shorten           the     distance
between       two     portions    of    the       structural            member.              Shortening
the   distance         may   cause   radial         expansion           of     a    portion         of     the
structural support.
[0130]           Force     for  shortening            the     distance           may      be     supplied
by  a    central         axis  member       that       may       transect           the      structural
support.             The    resulting        shape         could        be       derived           from       a
combination          of   the  expansion         described            and     the     resistance            of
the cavity walls.
[0131]           The     deformation      may       be     achieved           by     direct          force,
such as by a balloon.

[0132]             The    structural            support may be expanded torsionally.
The     torsional          expansion           may      be     either        elastic         or    plastic      in
nature.             For       example,          the       distal          end      of     the       structural
support         may    be      rotated         relative            to    the      proximal          end.       The
structural support may then expand to fill the cavity.
[0133]             Many        different            materials             could         be     utilized         to
achieve the desire expansion and strength features described.
[0134]             The    structural             support          may     include         support        members
that      form a cage or a portion of a cage.                                      The support members
may     have      one    or more           of   many       different           configurations.                 The
structural           support          may     have       any       suitable          number       of      support
members.            For    example,           the     number          of    support        members         may  be
1, 2,      3, 4,      5,    6, 7,        8,   10,    25,      50,     100 or more.
[0135]             The     support          members         may       have      any      suitable          cross
sectional          shape.           For     example,           the      support        members        may     have
one     or    more     of      the      following          cross-sectional                 shapes:         round,
flat,        rectangular,             "I"     beam,       tubular,           stranded,           twisted       and
many others.
[0136]             The    structural            support may have any suitable                              shape.
For        example,             the        structural                support           may        be       round,
cylindrical,            flat,        rectangular,              spiral,         helical,         wisk       or  egg
beater like, egg like or oval, branching or free-ended.
[0137]             The      structural             support            may      be     constructed             from
unitary           or    multi-component                    assemblies.                   The        structural
support may be:                machined,           laser        cut     form a        tube,      etched       from
a     sheet,      assembled           and     joined         strips,         molded,         deposited         and
or sintered.

[0138]          The proximal end of the structural                                 support may join
and  lock to        the      anchor      substrate.              The proximal             end may also
interface with            the delivery instrument.                          The proximal end may
have   suitable          features          for     delivery,           actuation,           locking    and
release.        Such features may include, for example, one or more
thread, socket, pin,                 snap, collet, cable mechanisms                            and other
suitable mechanism.
Anchoring Substrate
[0139]          The     apparatus           may       include         one       or   more      anchoring
substrates.            An     anchoring         substrate           may      receive        one   or  more
anchors     and     hold       them     in    a    desired         position         with     or   without
the  joint       assistance           of     the      structural            support        and   with   or
without      cancellous            bone.           The       anchoring           substrate        may   be
sized    and     shaped         such     that      it     may      be      engaged       by   an   anchor
that penetrates into the intramedullary space.
[0140]          The     anchoring            substrate           may       be    sized       and   shaped
such    that      once        the     anchoring           element           penetrates          into   the
intramedullary            space,       the     anchoring           substrate          may    engage    the
anchor.         The     anchoring           substrate            may      provide       to    an   anchor
tension       that        is      supplemental              to      tension          caused       by   the
engagement of the anchor and the anchoring substrate.
[0141]          There       are    several         methods         by which         the     anchors    and
the anchoring substrate may engage.
[0142]          Some of the methods are passive engagement methods.
In  passive        engagement,             anchoring           substrate           features        may  be
appropriately           sized       to     engage        an    anchor.            For     example,     the
anchor     and     anchoring           substrate           may      be     configured         such    that
they   engage        in     a   manner        analogous           to     a    screw     and     hole.     A
laser cut       structure could take any shape necessary to achieve

                                                       -   22
appropriate              anchor        engagement            and     retention.              The      receiving
cavities          ("cells") could be round, square,                                  slotted, triangle,
or     any     shape        that       facilitated             engagement.               The      geometry        of
the     cells       may be that               of a     shortening design.                    The      cells may
form       a    matrix,           a    "fabric,"            or    a    "cloth."              The      anchoring
substrate may include a single layer or multiple layers.
[0143]              Matrix        characteristics                 may be        varied       along       an    axis
of         the         anchoring                 substrate             to         provide             anchoring
characteristics                  along        the     axis.         For     example,         cell       geometry
may     be     varied        to     provide          engagement          with      different            types     of
anchors.              Anchoring             substrate            thickness          may      be      varied       to
provide          different           degrees           of    anchor        retention            strength        and
forces.
[0144]              There       are      several         approaches           to    active         engagement.
One      such       approach            is     cell       size      reduction.               The      anchoring
substrate            may      be     deformed           such      that       the     size        of    cells      is
reduced.             The      cell       size       reduction          may      cause      tightening            (or
locking) of the cell onto the anchor.
[0145]              Another               such            approach               involves               relative
displacement              between          first        and      second       anchoring            substrates.
The     relative           displacement              effectively            reduces        cell       size     when
corresponding cells                     are offset from each other.                              The    relative
displacement               may      be      axial,         rotational,             radial,          etc...      The
relative           displacement                may      trap      an     anchor        between           the    two
displaced            anchoring           substrates            and     effectively            lock       or    hold
the      anchor.             Cells         of      selected         shapes,         either          similar       or
different,            in     the     first         and    second        anchoring          substrates           may
be     moved         in     a     cooperative             manner         to     trap       or      engage       the
anchor.

[0146]        Another           such        approach              involves               twisting            the
anchoring        substrate.                This         action           may         be      similar          to
stretching        and      locking        the        anchor         in      the        medium         of     the
substrate.         Other      approaches            include         wrapping,            plicating           and
bunching     the      anchoring           substrate.                 A    plicated            or      bunched
configuration          may     exert       force        by     having           several          layers       of
material    binding         on   the     anchor         at    one      time,        effectively            wire
tying the anchor.
[0147]        The       arrangement              of      different              portions              of     the
anchoring     substrate          may     be    selected           to     facilitate             engagement
with   an   anchor.            Portions           of     the      anchoring              substrate           may
extend   radially          away    from      a    central          or     longitudinal                axis    of
the  apparatus         or    the     anchoring            substrate.                 Portions          of    the
anchoring       substrate          may      be        supported            in       a     perpendicular
orientation with respect to the axis.
[0148]        After       the     anchoring            substrate            is      engaged          with     an
anchor,    the      anchoring           substrate            may       apply         tension           to    the
anchor.     The     tension        may urge           the     anchor        to move          relative         to
the  structural          element.           This       can     be     accomplished               by     moving
the  anchoring substrate in an axial                            direction relative                      to the
structural        member.            If     the       anchoring             substrate             is      moved
proximally      relative         to    the     structural              support,          tension          would

segments.
[0149]        The       tension          may       be       achieved             by      reducing            the
diameter       of       the      anchoring              substrate.                      This         can      be
accomplished         though       lengthening              and       therefore             reducing          the
anchoring     substrate          diameter.             The     tension may be                   applied by
wrapping,     folding,         twisting,           rotating           or    radially           pulling        in

the        anchoring              substrate.                   The       plicated              or       bunched
configuration mentioned above may be used for this approach.
[0150]            In some embodiments,                     the anchoring substrate may be
internal to the structural                          support.           In some embodiments,                    the
anchoring            substrate             may      be      external           to       the        structural
support.           Some       embodiments           may include             one     or more          anchoring
substrates            that      are      internal         to     the     structural             support        and
one     or    more         anchoring          substrates           that      are       external          to    the
structural             support.               In     some       embodiments,               the       anchoring
substrate may be attached to the structural support.
[0151]               In     some      embodiments,             the      anchoring           substrate          may
cooperate          mechanically                with       the     structural             support.              The
anchor        substrate             may      provide         structural             integrity            to    the
device.           For       example,          the     matrix       may      include          interlockable
features.              The     interlocking             features         may     become          interlocked
during or after the anchoring substrate is expanded.
[0152]            In some embodiments,                     the anchoring substrate may be
mechanically independent of the structural                                        support.             This may
allow       for     relative          movement          between         the     anchoring            substrate
and the structural support.
[0153]            The        anchoring          substrate           may     be      expandable.                The
anchoring             substrate            may      expand          simultaneously                  with       the
structural           support.             The     anchoring         substrate           may be expanded
by    the     structural             support.            The     anchoring            substrate          may    be
expanded          by       a    delivery           device        such       as      a    balloon.              The
substrate          may be         self-expanding.                 Self-expanding                 embodiments
may include spring                   like elements.                Self-expanding embodiments
may     include          elements           that       include        shape       memory           materials,
such       as     shape         memory         alloys.            In     some        embodiments,              the

anchoring            substrate       may      be        non-expanding.                 In       some
embodiments,           the   anchoring         substrate          may      be   expandable         by
mechanical actuation.
[0154]            The   anchoring     substrate           may be       constructed       in     many
different         forms    and  of    many      different          materials.         The     forms
may     include,       for   example,      braid,         mesh,     weave,      strand,       laser
cut         members,        deposited           members            or       other       filament
construction.             The   anchoring           substrate         cells     may    be     round
elements,         square    element,      rectangular             elements,       or  profiled,
or    a    combination      of  cell     types.           The     anchor      substrate       cells
may     be   designed      to  mimic     bone        and     act    as   a   growth    or    graft
scaffold.
[0155]            The   anchoring     substrate           may be      made     form a     unitary
element       such as an extruded tube                 or flat sheet with a pattern
cut       into     it   that   would       facilitate            engagement.            Examples
include        a    laser-cut     tube,       a     stamped        or    etched     sheet,        and
other suitable approaches.
[0156]            The    anchoring       substrate             may      be     made    of       many
materials          including    but     not      limited        to;     Nitinol,      Titanium,
steel        alloys,       polymers,         porous           materials,          sponge        like
materials,            sintered      metal,           etched        materials,         deposited
material, extruded material and molded materials.
Anchors
[0157]            Anchors     may     facilitate              the    attachment         of      bone
segments        to    the  anchoring       substrate.              The    anchors     may    mate,
couple,          engage,      lock     and        otherwise           interact       with         the
anchoring         substrate.       Some      of     the     anchors       may   be   configured
to engage the bone.              Some of the anchors may be configured to
not engage the bone.

                                               -   26
[0158]           An   anchor         may     have      an      elongated          element.                The
elongated        element       may     include      one      or    catch     features          that       are
configured to engage the                   anchoring substrate.                     The engagement
may      be  occur     substantially             immediately          after        penetration             of
the      anchoring      substrate          by    the     anchor.          The      engagement            may
occur       only    after       a    predetermined              length      of      the      elongated
member has passed into the anchoring substrate.                                         Some anchors
may      lock   to   the     anchoring         substrate.             Some      anchors         may       not
lock to the anchoring substrate
[0159]           Catch       features         may       be       self-actuating.                      Catch
features may be user actuated.
[0160]           Anchors       may     have    any     suitable         length.           Anchors          of
different          lengths        may      be     used        in     conjunction             with         the
apparatus.          The anchors can be configured to enter and engage
the      anchoring      substrate          with     an     end     portion        of     the     anchor.
Those       anchors,      after        they    are     locked,        may      terminate            inside
the      anchoring      substrate.            Some      anchors       may     be     configured            to
pass      through     the      anchoring         substrate          and    engage         bone       on    an
opposite        side    of    the      anchoring        substrate.            Some       anchors         may
be      configured       to     not      engage       bone        on   either          side       of      the
anchoring          substrate.               Example          anchors         include:            screws,
helical       elements,        T bar,       barbed       features,        anchors          cut     from a
tube, with tabbed features.
[0161]           In    some        embodiments,             anchors         may        be      used        in
conjunction         with      buttress        elements          such    as     plates,         washers,
spacers and the like.
[0162]           A   proximal           anchor      may      be     inserted           to    anchor          a
proximal       portion       of    the    anchoring         substrate         to     the bone.             In
some       embodiments,          the      proximal          anchor      may       be      engaged          to

                                                  -  27
preserve         tension           in   the        anchoring       substrate.                In   some
embodiments,           the     proximal        anchor     may    be   configured          to    adjust
the tension.
Central Axis Member
[0163]           In    embodiments           that     include     a   central       axis      member,
the       central        axis        member         may    be    used        to   position         the
apparatus,          actuate         one    or     more    changes       (e.g.,      of     expansion
state      or   stress       state)      of     the    apparatus,       move     one portion        of
the     apparatus         relative         to     another     portion        of   the      apparatus
and      provide         mechanical            support        (e.g.,       rigidity)          to   the
apparatus.
[0164]           In     some        embodiments,           the    apparatus          may      have    a
distal       end     and     a   proximal          end.      The    support       structure        may
have       a   distal         end      and      a    proximal       end.         The       anchoring
substrate         may     have       a  distal        end    and    a   proximal        end.       The
central axis member may have a distal end and a proximal end.
In     some      embodiments,            the       central      axis      member       may      extend
proximally beyond the proximal ends                            of the structural              support
and       the      anchoring           member.            In     those         embodiments,         an
intermediate portion of the central                            axis member may generally
align       with     the    proximal         ends      of   the   structural          support      and
the anchoring substrate.
[0165]           The     central        axis        member    may     be     used     to     maintain
rigidity         of     the       structural          support       and/or       the       anchoring
substrate.              In     those      embodiments,           the     distal       end     of   the
central axis member may be longitudinally fixed to the distal
end of the          structural support and/or the                      anchoring substrate.
The    proximal        end     or    intermediate          portion      of the       central      axis
member may be longitudinally fixed to the proximal end of the
structural support and/or the anchoring substrate.

[0166]             The     central          axis    member         may      be    used      to     adjust        the
length          of      the        structural            support           and/or          the        anchoring
substrate.                In     those         embodiments,             the       distal         end      of     the
central         axis      member         may     be     fixed      to      the     distal         end      of    the
structural            support         and/or       anchoring           substrate.              The      proximal

be    longitudinally                movable        (whether          linearly,           rotationally             or
otherwise)            with respect             to the central axis member.                              As    such,
the     central         axis      member may be              used      to expand           the      structural
support         or    the     anchoring          substrate.              The     central         axis       member
may        be      used         to       lock       the        apparatus             in        an       expanded
configuration.                  The     central        member       may be         locked        in    place      by
other elements of the apparatus.
[0167]                 In     some      embodiments,            the      central        axis       member        may
be    used       to place          a   lower      or     upper       limit       on    the      longitudinal
separation            between          distal       and      proximal          ends       of     the      support
structure              and/or           anchoring            substrate.                    This          may      be
accomplished by providing detents                                at     selected locations                    along
the central axis member.
[0168]              In some embodiments, the                       central axis member may be
used to         linearly displace                  the     structural            support         relative         to

to    the       support         structure.              The     central          axis      member          may    be
used to linearly displace                         one anchoring substrate                         relative to
another           anchoring            substrate.                In       such       embodiments,                the
central         axis      member        may be        longitudinally               fixed       to     whichever
of the       structural             support and the anchoring substrate that                                      is
to be moved relative to another.
[0169]             The     central axis member may be used to mechanically
load       the     structural            support         and/or        the     anchoring            substrate.

The     load    may    be     in      tension,            compression           or     rotation.               The
load      may   be    applied          by     suitable            engaging         the      central         axis
member       with      a    portion            of       the       structural           support          and/or
anchoring        substrate.               The       central         axis     member          may     then       be
loaded,       for   example,           at    its       proximal        end.         The     central         axis
member may then transfer the                           load through the engagement with
the structural           support and/or anchoring structure.
[0170]          Where       the       central            axis      member        is      longitudinally
fixed      to   the    structural             support          and/or       anchoring            substrate,
it   may    remain      free      to    rotate.             Where     the central             axis      member
is     not     longitudinally                 fixed,          the      apparatus             may      include
suitable bushings, bearings,                           frictional surfaces                   and the        like
to     permit       suitable             linear           displacement              and/or          rotation
between       the   central           axis       member         and    the      structural            support
and/or anchoring substrate.
[0171]          For      example,             the         central         axis       member           may       be
longitudinally             fixed        to     the        distal       end      of     the       structural
support       and    rotationally                fixed        to    the     proximal          end      of      the
anchoring         substrate.                  The       distal         end       of      the       anchoring
substrate       may     or may not             be     rotationally            fixed       to     the    distal
end     of  the    support         structure.                The    central        axis       may     thus      be
used in different configurations to deform                                       (e.g., wrap,             fold,
twist, etc.)         the     anchoring substrate.                        Similar configurations
may be used to deform the structural support.
[0172]          In    some       embodiments,                the     central         axis      member         may
include or        serve as an anchoring substrate.                                  The central             axis
member      may    be    removable            so     that      it    may     be    removed          from       the
apparatus after its desired effect is achieved.

[0173]             The    central         member      may      be   flexible          or     rigid.         The
central          member       may     be      integral           with     one       or    both         of   the
structural           support        and     the    anchoring         substrate.               The     central
axis      member       may      include        one     or     more     cables,         coils,         thread,
braids,         extrusions,          beading,         rods,       bundles,          strands,          meshes,
nested elements              and the like.
Apparatus Removal
[0174]             The     apparatus           may      be       removable          from        the      bone.
Approaches for removal may include collapsing the apparatus.
[0175]             In some        instances, tissue may grow into                              interstices
of     the       apparatus.               Energy         (e.g.,       vibrations,               ultrasonic
energy,         heat    and     the     like)      may be        coupled       into      the      apparatus
to    release         the    tissue.           When     heat       energy       is    used,         the    heat
may     be     generated          from     energy       in      any   suitable          form,         such   as
radio      frequency, microwave,                     induction,         electrical resistance,
and others.
[0176]             The     apparatus            and      methods         may        include           removal
instruments            such      as   a    hollow       drill,       a    coring        drill         and   the
like.           The     apparatus          may     fit      inside       one       or    more        of    such
instruments.
Bone Ingrowth
[0177]             One    or more        surfaces of the apparatus may be coated
with       agents        that       promote        bone        ingrowth.             The       agents       may
include          calcium          phosphate,           heat        treated          hydroxylapatite,
Basic       fibroblast          growth        factor        (bFGF)-coated             hydroxyapatite,

suitable          agents,        including           one     or    more      of     those        listed      in
Table 1.

[0178]          One    or more        surfaces of the apparatus may be coated
with       agents   that      inhibit         or     prohibit         bone      ingrowth.               Such
surfaces       may    include       impermeable            and     other     materials            such    as
one or more of those listed in Table 1.
Drug Delivery
[0179]          One    or more        surfaces of the apparatus may be coated
with       agents    that     may      elute        therapeutic            substances            such     as
drugs.
Complications
[0180]          The     apparatus          and       methods        may      include          means       to
address        complications             that        may       be    associated            with         bone
implants.         One     such complication               is     infection.          The      apparatus
and     methods     may     include        features           that    counteract            infection.
For      example,      such     a     feature         may       include       a    coating.              The
coating       may   include       antibiotics             such      as    tobramycin            or    other
effective        antimicrobials.                Another           such    feature        may       be    the
delivery         of     heat        to       raise         the      apparatus            temperature
sufficiently          high      to     kill       bacteria          and      other       undesirable
tissues on or near the implant.
Installation
[0181]          The       following           is       one        illustrative             method         of
installation         of    the   apparatus           in    a    bone    that     has     a    fracture.
The     procedure      may    be     completed          either       in    an    inpatient           or   an
outpatient setting.
     1. Provisionally             reduce          the          fracture         using           standard
          techniques

                                       - 32
2. Access    the     intramedullary            cavity     in     a   location           that
   causes     minimal        tissue        damage      to      the     patient            and
    sufficient access for the physician;                   proximal or distal.
3. Introduce     a    delivery        catheter     into      the    bone       near       the
   area   of    the      fracture.        Position      can     be     confirmed            on
    fluoroscopy.
4. Deploy the     structural          support.     A positioning aid, which
   may  be   a   central        axis     member,    may     be    used.         External
   manipulation may be applied.
5. Reposition      the     fractured         bone   into      its    ideal        healing
    location.      The    positioning         aid  may     then    be    locked         into
   the  wall    of    the   intramedullary          cavity      by    deploying           the
   anchoring mechanism.
6. Deploy     an     anchor         tensioning       element          (such        as       an
   anchoring       substrate)            into     the       space        inside           the
    structural      support          and     near    the       location          of       the
    fracture.
7. Deploy     anchors        in       the     fracture       fragments,             either
   externally      or     internally,         depending        on    accessibility.
   The  anchors      are    driven       through    both      the     fragments           and
   the anchoring substrate.
8. Confirm    location       of    the   fragments     via     x-ray,      fluoro,          or
   direct     visualization.               Apply     tension        as      needed          to
   position     the      fracture         in   the   desired        position            with
   adequate    pressure        on    the   fragment     surfaces        to    stabilize
   the fracture for healing.
9. Lock the apparatus in place.
10.      Disengage        delivery       instruments       from     the     apparatus.
   Remove    the    delivery        instruments       from      the    patient,           and
   close patient.

[0182]    Numerous    other    steps  may    be   involved    and  many
different   sequences    of    steps  may    be   practiced     without
departing from the principles of the invention.

[0189]              FIG.     1    shows        illustrative                device     100      implanted          in
bone       B,    which      is     illustrated              as     a     radius.        Bone       B   includes
bone portions              PB,     Ph   and      Pa    in    distal         end D.        Bone      segment        PB
is     the     largest portion                of bone B.                Bone    segment        Ph is       a head
portion.              Bone     segments           Ph     and    Pa      include      articular           surface
AS.         Bone      portions         PB,     Ph     and     Pa     are     separated         or    partially
separated            along      fractures            Fa     and      Fh.       Fracture        Fa    transects

[0190]          It    will be appreciated that bone portions                  PB,    Ph  and
Pa define an          illustrative fracture in bone B.                  Device 100 may
be   used      to    treat    fractures      that     have   a    greater     or    lesser
number       of     bone    portions.           The    bone     portions      may       have
different       shapes,     orientations        and    sizes   from those       shown in
FIG.    1.     It    will be appreciated           also that the fracture             shown
in FIG. 1 is illustrated as a fracture near the end of a long
bone,    but device        100 may be used to treat               fractures     in    other
portions       of    long   bones,     such    as   the   midshaft,       and   in    bones
that may be          identified      as being other than           long bones,        e.g.,
vertebrae.
[0191]          Device 100 is elongated along its longitudinal axis
LD    (in     which      D    indicates      device).          Device       100     is    in
intramedullary          space    IS of bone B.           Distal    end 102     of device
100 is in epiphyseal region E of bone B.                        Proximal end 104 is
in   or    adjacent      diaphyseal      region      D of bone       B.     Portions      of
device      100    that   are between       distal      end 102     and proximal         end
104 are in metaphyseal region M of bone B.
[0192]          Device       100     may    include       structural         cage       105.
Structural cage 105 may include support members 106.                               Support
members      106 may extend from cage base 108                    to distal     hub     110.
 (The   direction       extending      from cage base        108 will be         referred
to as the "distal direction."                   The opposite direction will be
referred       to as     the "proximal       direction."          "Distal,"      relative
to   "proximal,"         generally      means    the    leading     end   of   apparatus
that    is    inserted,      or   is   to be     inserted,      in   the body.)          The
distance       along     axis   LD between       cage base       108    and distal       hub
110   may be        adjusted     to   change     the    shape    of   support     members
106.

                                           - 39
[0193]       When    cage base         108      is    maximally        spaced     apart     from
distal hub 110,       structural cage 105 is in a compressed state.
When   cage   base    108     and    distal         hub    110    are     pushed     or   drawn
together,     structural          members           106      are    deflected         radially
outward    along     radial      direction            RD    (in   which       "D"   indicates
device).        In   this      way,       structural            cage     105    may     expand.
Device    100     is    shown        in      an      expanded         state.          In    some
embodiments,      structural        members         106    and    anchor      substrate      124
may self-expand radially.                 This may draw base                 108 and distal
hub 110 together longitudinally.
[0194]       Structural        cage     105 may be            used to provide           support
to  bone    portions      PB,     Pa    and      Ph.       The     support      may     include
aligning    and    stabilizing         bone        segments       PB,    Pa   and   Ph   during
reduction     and/or     healing.              The     support      may     be   subchondral
support.      Structural         cage      105      may    be    used     to   provide      load
resistance to bone B during healing.
[0195]       Device     100      may      include         anchoring         substrate       112.
Substrate    112 may be engaged by anchors                        such as      114    and 116.
Anchor 114     fastens     bone segment              Ph to substrate           112.      Anchor
116  fastens     bone    segment        Pa     to    substrate         112.      The    anchors
may engage     substrate        112    in     a wide       range      of positions.          The
anchors may engage substrate 112 from a wide range of angles.
Each of the anchors may apply a force                           to its     respective       bone
portion.     The force may be oriented to appropriately position
the bone portions for healing.                       The    force may be directed at
least in part toward axis LD.                     The force may be considered an
inward     force      (at       least         partially           in     direction         -RD)
Structural     cage    105    may     apply        to    the bone       portions       a  force
that   is  directed      at     least       in    part     away     from     axis    LD.     The

                                                     -  40
force       from      structural           cage       105      may   be   considered          an     outward
force       (at least partially in direction                             RD)
 [0196]            Anchors         114      and      116       are    illustrated           as     threaded
screws, but any suitable anchors may be used.
 [0197]            The       anchors,            anchoring            substrate            and       support

cross-sectional             shapes,        dimensions          or    material         properties.
When   support          members        have       different        shapes,        dimensions       or
material      properties,           support        cage    105    may    undergo        non-radial
deformation.            Such    deformation           may be      helpful        for    conforming

 [0225]         FIG.       4     shows        portion           400      of     an      illustrative

appropriately.              A   limb      nerve       block       may     be    administered.             A

imaging system 404.
 [0226]         FIG.    5    shows       illustrative therapeutic scenario                            500.
In     scenario       500,    manual        traction           techniques           are   applied       to
reestablish         anatomic        reduction          in   fracture        Fp in     bone B.
 [0227]          Provisional             or       temporary             reduction           is       often
undertaken          in   fracture         repair          to    restore        bone      segments       to
their normal positions before they are anchored.
 [0228]         When     the      number       of     bone       segments        is    small       and/or
the       dislocation         of     the      bone         segments         is     modest,         closed
reduction        techniques         may     be     employed.            Closed reduction              does

                                                      -  48
not     include       incisions            and     utilizes        manual       traction          by     one   or
more      physicians.                The         physicians            will      utilize           different
tension,      compression,                 and       bending       motions        to     reestablishing
normal      bone       segment          positioning.               A     physician          or     assistant
may     maintain          the      normal          bone       segment        positions            during       an
implant procedure.
[0229]        For more displaced fracture patterns,                                      a limited open
reduction        can       be      utilized.               K-Wires,        external           probes,         and
special        clamps            can          be        employed          for       the        provisional
reduction.            Small       incisions             can    be    made     allowing          the      probes
and     clamps      to      aid     in      repositioning              the    fracture           segments.
Once      the     bone         segments             are      in    position          k-wires           can     be
utilized          to          maintain                the       reduction.                K-Wires             are
approximately             1-2mm        in      diameter         metallic        wires        that       can    be
driven      across         fracture            lines        to   provide        temporary            support.
The     k-wires       may be        positioned              and   then      removed        strategically
to       facilitate            the         procedure             in      a     way        that         reduces
interference               with bone                cavity         preparation               or        implant
deployment.

B.      Sheath     600      may include               lumen     610.       Lumen       610     may provide
access       to      intramedullary                    space      IS.          Sheath          600       enters
intramedullary space                    IS     at position          602.       Position          602 may be
in     diaphyseal          section            D    of     bone    B.         Position          602     may     be
selected      to minimize                soft      tissue       damage.         Near position                602,
a   small    incision may be made                         in the      soft tissue             (not shown).
The tissue may be displaced to reveal bone surface BS.
[0231]          A    standard orthopaedic drill instrument may be used
to    create     access         hole        604      in    bone    B.       Axis     hole       604     may    be

drilled along axis               Lh.       Axis     Lh   may     form      an angle A with bone
axis LB.         Angle A may be an acute angle.
 [0232]           Hole     604    may      be    similar          to    commonly           drilled          bone
access       holes.        Hole      604    may     be     sufficiently              small       that       hole
604 does         not cause stress             risers        at position             602.        Distal end
606      of    sheath       600    may      be     advanced,           through          intramedullary
canal      IC,     into metaphyseal             region        M of bone            B.      Proximal           end
608     of   sheath      600 may be positioned in hole                             604.         Distal        end
606     may     be    disposed        in    any     portion         of     intramedullary                 space
IS,     such as in the end-bone.

segments       Ph    and     Pa,   respectively.             Anchors         114   and     116     are
secured inside bone B by anchoring substrate                                 112.      The inward
forces      applied         by    anchors        114      and     116,      in    concert        with
anchoring        substrate         112,      and    the    outward        forces      applied       by
support members 106 of structural                         cage    105, have brought bone
segments       Ph   and     Pa   into     alignment        along     fracture        Fa   and have
closed     fracture          Fa.       The     torque      (applied to           the     anchors),
angle   and positioning               of    anchors      114   and     116    may be      selected
to  provide        a   desired        contact      force     between         bone    segments        Ph
and  Pa    along       fracture         Fa.      The    anchors        may     lock     to    anchor
substrate 112 to prevent unintentional removal.

which separates               Pa and        Ph    from      PB,     the main segment                  of bone B.
Intersegment            compression              of bone segments                   Pa,    Ph   and     PB   may be
provided         using        one      or     more        of     device          100,      device         delivery
apparatus          800      and       delivery            apparatus            controller             900.         The
compression may help reduce or eliminate Af.                                                The compression
may promote            healing.              The     compression               may     provide          stability
to the bone segments in rotation and bending.
[0243]            In       some         embodiments,                  the        compression               may       be
provided         by      drawing           device          100       in      proximal          direction            Dp,

temporarily.              For example,               length T may be held fixed using a
mechanical           relationship                of     central          axis      member         124      to     cage
base       108    and       hub       110.          Device          100       may     then       be      drawn       in
direction           Dp     by      device           delivery             apparatus            800.            Device
delivery         apparatus           800     may be          drawn        in    direction          Dp by        shaft
802.        Shaft      802 may be drawn through                            lumen 610 using delivery
apparatus controller 900.
[0244]            Device          900      may      include            a     mechanism           that       may      be
activated         by     a    trigger          or    lever         such       as    904     or     906.         Shaft
802 may be drawn by drawing delivery apparatus controller                                                          900

to     the     extent        that       it      remains          in      intramedullary                space       IS,
will      travel       generally            along        direction            Dp   and draw          device        100
in that direction via device delivery apparatus 800.
[0245]            In     some       embodiments,                length          T    may      be    allowed          to
extend when            device        100     is    drawn        in    direction           Dp.      Hub 110 may
be      substantially               retained              in     position             relative            to      bone
segment Pa.             Cage       base      108     may be          allowed         to be       displaced           in
direction          Dp.       This       may      reduce         radius         RD    Of    structural             cage

                                        - 53
105.     When    the    radius      of   structural         cage     105    is   reduced,
radially    outward     forces      on bone may be           reduced,       canceled     or
reversed.
[0246]      As   the   length     of   device    100     is    increased       while   its
radius    decreases,        device       100    may      collapse        partially       or
completely to its delivered state.                  Depending on the diameter
of intramedullary space IS of bone, B such contraction may be
desirable     to   obtain     proper     placement        of     the   bone     segments.
After   proper     bone    segment      position      is     obtained,       the   radial
diameter    can    be   adjusted       to   achieve       the     desired      shape   and
radial    force.        This     condition      can      then      be   maintained       by
locking    central     axis member        124   at distal          and proximal       ends
of device 100.
[0247]         In    some      embodiments,         a      proximal         portion      of
anchoring    substrate       112    may be    drawn      in    direction       Dp.    This
may  draw    anchors      such     as   114   and    116      in    direction      Dp  and
direction     -RB.       Anchoring        substrate        112     may    be    drawn    in
direction Dp with a force that is greater, lesser or equal to
that by which structural cage 105 is drawn in direction Dp.
[0248]       In some embodiments, a physician may assess and, if
appropriate,      adjust one or more           of segments          Pa,   Ph and PB to
achieve a desired alignment.                The assessment may be performed
using fluoroscopic imaging, for example, using imaging system
404   (shown    in   FIG.    4).       The   assessment          may    be   done   under
direct     visualization          during      a   full         surgical        cut    down

fracture          F      has     been      stabilized,                reduced         or     substantially
eliminated.               Anchor       122     is     now      inserted          through         bone      B  into
stem       128.       Anchor       122     may      retain         proximal          portion          of    device
100     at   or     near      an   axial       position           along       bone     axis       LB.       Anchor
122     may prevent             device      100      from rotating                 about     bone       axis    LB
Anchor       122      may     preserve         the      intersegment               compression           between
bone      segments          Pa,   Ph   and      PB.        More      generally,           anchor         122    may
preserve         one      or    more     of     a   desired           position,          orientation            and
state       of     stress        for     each       of      the      individual           bone        segments.
Anchor        122      may      carry       all      or      some       of      the    load.            Friction
between        structural           cage      105      and      other       portions         of     device      100
may bear some of the load.
 [0250]            In     some embodiments,                  the     role       of   anchor        122     may be
fulfilled          by     several       anchors          that      may be        used      to     lock      device
100      in   bone        B    while      preserving              the      compression.                 Proximal
anchors may gain purchase                         from both sides                  of the bone            or just
through        one       side.        The     angle         of    the      anchors        may      range      from
near parallel              to axis       LD   to perpendicular                   to axis        LD.

such as      engagement        member      1602   to    recapture      device    100    in    a
manner such as that shown in FIG. 16.
[0257]         FIG.        18     shows       illustrative          delivery/recapture
member 1802, which in               some embodiments           may be an alternative
to device retention member                 126 in     a device      such as   100     (shown
in   FIG.     1) .     Delivery/recapture             member      1802   may   be    formed
from   a    tube.       Notch       1810    may    be    cut    into   the   tube.        Any
appropriate        number      of notches       such as       1810 may be present           in
delivery/recapture             member      1802.        Delivery/recapture           member
1802    may     include        ferrule       1804,     which      may   be   affixed        to
proximal       end     1806      of   device      stem      1806.       Stem    1806      may
correspond to stem 128 of device 100                       (shown in FIG. 1).
[0258]         Recapture        instrument        1812    may    include    one    or   more
blades     such     as    blade      1814.       Recapture       instrument      1812      and
blade 1814 may be cut from a tube to match delivery/recapture
member       1802      and      notch      1810,       respectively.            Recapture
instrument 1812 may be delivered through a sheath such as 600
 (shown   in    FIG.    6)    into an intramedullary              space   to retrieve         a
device attached to stem 1808.
[0259]         Recapture         instrument         1812      may    be    aligned      with
delivery/recapture             member    1802.        Blade     1814   may be     inserted
into     cut-out         1816       in     delivery/recapture            member        1802.
Recapture instrument 1812 may be rotated such that blade 1814
moves    into      notch     1810.      Recapture        instrument      1812    may     thus
engage    delivery/recapture             member      1802     to pull    the   device       in
proximal       direction        Dr.      Blade      1814     and    delivery/recapture
member 1802 may bend radially out of plane from each other to
disengage.           The      bending       may    be     achieved      by   bending        or

 [0260]           FIG.        19     shows        illustrative            device         1900.         Device
1900      may have          features        that       function        like      some      or all      of    the
corresponding              features         of     device        100   (shown        in   FIG.     1).       For
example, device                1900 may include supports                        1906 that form cage
1905.           Cage       1905       may     include          cage      base      1908.         Anchoring
substrate base               1932      may be present concentrically within cage
base        1908.              Device         retention             member         1926      may       extend
proximally            from      anchoring           substrate         base      1932.        Device         1900
does       not    include          a   stem      such      as     stem    128.          Proximal       anchor
1932 may be used to engage a bone such as B                                         (shown in FIG.            1)
with the proximal end of anchoring substrate 1912.
 [0261]           FIG.       20     shows     a    cross-section             of    device      1900       taken
along       lines       20-20        (shown       in    FIG.       19) .      Illustrative            central
axis      member        1924      is     fixed      at    hub      1910    of    support       cage       1905.
Central         axis       member         1924      may     include         flange        1902.        Flange
1902       may    be    mechanically              locked        into     chamber         1904    of    device
retention           member         1926.          In     some       embodiments,            central         axis
member 1924 may be moved axially until                                    flange 1902           snaps       into
chamber          1904.          This       may      lock-in         central        axis      member         1924
between proximal                 end      1920     and     distal      end 1922          of   device        1900
and      thus     provide          axial      tension          that      may    support        the     radial
stiffness            of    device          1900.          Central         axis       member        1924      may
distribute            tension         that     may      be      applied       to     device       retention
member        1926     between         proximal         end 1920         and     distal      end      1922    of
device 1900.
 [0262]            In     some       embodiments,             device        1900      may    be     expanded
before         deployment              (as     in      an      open      reduction).                In      such
embodiments,             structural           support          1905    and     anchoring          substrate

                                       - 58
1932  may be     longitudinally         fixed with          respect     to each        other
at proximal end 1920 and distal end 1922 of device 1900.
[0263]       FIG.      21   shows,       in      cross-section,            illustrative
ratchet mechanism 2100.             Ratchet       mechanism        2100    may be       used
to  preserve      tension     in   a   central       axis     member      such      as    124
 (shown in FIG.       1).    A portion        of such       a central        axis member
may be   embodied       as  ribbed member           2102.       Ribbed      member       2102
may be drawn through tabbed member 2104 in proximal direction
Dr.    Rib   2106     may   be   drawn      in    direction        DP   by     deflecting
annular    tab   2108.      After    rib     2106    passes       annular       tab    2108,
annular   tab    2108    moves   back     to its      rest position            (as   shown)
and prevents      rib 2106 from moving back to a position                          that is
distal to annular tab 2108.
[0264]       Ratchet      mechanism 2100         may be provided            in   or about
an  anchoring     substrate base         such     as   132,    in    or  about a         stem
such as    128,    in   or about     a proximal         base     such    120     or   in   or
about   device      retention     member        126    (all     shown     in     FIG.     1).
Tabbed member 2104 may be longitudinally fixed to the device.
The central axis member may be provided over a portion of its
length with ribbed member 2102.                   The central axis member may
thus be drawn in        proximal direction De and locked in                       place by
annular tabs 2108.          This may preserve tension in portions of
the central axis member that are distal of tabs 2108.
[0265]      Ratchet      features    may      take    on    any    shape     or    form to
facilitate      one-way     locking.           The    one-way        locking       may     be
permanent or releasable.             In    some embodiments,            tabs      2104 may
be  releasable      so that    ribbed member           2102    may be       adjusted       in

[0266]     The    ratchet     features     may    be   incorporated       into    the
apparatus.       The  ratchet      features     may   be   integral     to   one   or
more   portions    of  the    apparatus.        For   example,     device     stems,
such   as  those     shown     in   FIG.    25   may    include     complementary
ratchet   features     so that      when   the   stems    are   in   a  concentric
relationship, the inner stem can move in only one direction.
[0267]     FIG.    22  shows     an end view of ratchet mechanism 2100
 (shown in cross section, along lines 21-21, in FIG. 21).
[0268]       FIG. 23 shows illustrative stacking rings 2300 that
may form all      or a portion        of  a central       axis member      such    as
124  (shown in FIG. 1).           The rings are shown as one continuous
helix.      In   some   embodiments,        the    rings    may    be   individual
annular    rings     with    stacking       features      similar      to   helical
stacking rings 2300.
[0269]       FIG. 24 is a cross-sectional view taken along lines
24-24.     The   helical     rings    form     S-links    that    interlock      with
each   other under     longitudinal       loading     of the stack-either          in
compression or in tension.             The shape of stacking rings               2300
is such that may they wedge together in either compression or
tension    and    effectively        reduce     the    mechanical       degree     of
freedom to move relative to each other.                   All or a portion of
a  central     axis   member      such   as    124   (shown    in    FIG.   1)    may
include   a    segment    of    helical     rings    2300.       When    loaded    in
tension   or    compression,       the   central     axis   member     may   become
straight     and    rigid.        The    straightness       and     rigidity      may
increase the amount of load, whether in tension, compression,
or bending, that may be supported by a device such as 100.
[0270]       FIG. 25 shows illustrative device 2500, which is in
accordance with the principles of the invention.                       Device 2500

Threaded   support       cage base      2916     may be   longitudinally      fixed
to proximal      end 2912     of support        cage 2902.      Threaded support
cage base 2916 may include a first threaded longitudinal bore
 (not shown).
[0292]       Actuator 2910 may include double threaded anchoring
substrate base 2918.           Double threaded substrate base 2918 may
be   fixed    to   proximal      portion       2914   of   anchoring      substrate
2904.    Double       threaded     substrate       base   2918    may   have  outer
threads   2920    that may be screwed            into   the first     longitudinal
threaded   bore      of   support     cage     base   2916.       Double   threaded
substrate       base      2918     may        include     a    second      threaded
longitudinal bore         (not shown).
[0293]       Actuator       2910    may     include     threaded     central    axis
member base 2922.          Threaded central axis member base 2922 may
be  fixed    to   the    proximal     end     of   central    axis   member   2906.
Threaded central axis member base 2922 may have outer threads
2924    that      may     be     screwed        into    the     second     threaded

axis    member      base     2922     to     achieve      desired       displacement    or
displacements        between       the    proximal       portions       of  support   cage
2902,    anchoring       substrate       2904     and central        axis member     2906.
The   differential         displacements           may   expand      the   device   during
deployment.
 [0295]        After    deployment         of   device      2901,      anchors   2907  and
2908    may     be     inserted       through        bone     segments       P1  and   P2,
respectively, into anchoring substrate 2904.                             After insertion
of anchors 2907 and 2908,                relative displacement actuator 2910
may be used to adjust the stress state of bone segments Pi and
P2 .    For    example,       double      threaded       anchoring        substrate   base
2918   may be rotated such that                 it    moves    in   proximal direction
DP relative       to support        cage base 2916.              This relative motion
would draw bone          segments       Pi   and    P2 ,  relative      to   support  cage
2902,   in proximal direction DP and in inward radial direction
-RD.

[0311]       In   some embodiments,             a balloon      such    as    3118    (shown
in  FIG.   31)   may be       inserted      inside      anchoring      member      3300   to
expand    anchoring       member     200.         In    some   embodiments,         device
3300 may be self-expanding.
[0312]       Collar      3302    has     a   substantially         fixed      radius     and
may not expand.           Collar    3302 may include             rings     3303.      Rings
3303 may be arranged in a nested configuration in which rings
3303 are partially or substantially perpendicular to axis                                LD.
Rings     3303     may      be    coaxial         with      axis     LD.         In    such
configurations,         rings     3303       may      facilitate      coupling        to    a
central    axis   member       such    as   124      (shown   in   FIG.     1)   and/or     a
structural cage such as 105                (shown in FIG. 1).
[0313]       When     a balloon       is    used     for   expansion,       the balloon
may be    situated      a   sufficient        distal      distance     away     from stem
3306   so   that    the    radius     of    stem      3306   remains      substantially
the same during expansion of the balloon.

 [0314]           Anchoring substrate                      3304 may include expansion band
3310.         Expansion          band       3310       includes         expansion            cells         such  as
3312,        which       may      deform          along       directions              CD    and       -CD     under
radially         outward           (direction             RD)     stress          from       the       expanding
balloon.          Band 3310 has               a number of expansion cells along its
circumference.                   The      number           of    expansion             cells         along      the
circumference             of    a    band      such       as   3310      is     referred         as      the   cell
density.
 [0315]           Groups        of    cells         that       are    relatively             expandable          in
response         to     a   longitudinal              compression             may      be    considered          to
have       a  high        "expansion            ratio."            Groups          of     cells         that    are
relatively          inexpandable               in    response         to     the      same      longitudinal
compression             may      be      considered              to     have         a    low       "expansion
ratio."          Variations            in    cell        density,          cell       shape,        cell      "leg"
 (material bordering                    the       cell      that      separates             the      cell      from
other        cells        or     material)               (or     "strut")            length,           cell     leg
thickness         and      other       suitable           parameters            may      be   used         to  vary
the expansion ration.
 [0316]           Anchoring substrate                      3304 may include expansion band
3314.        Expansion band 3314 has                        a cell density that is                         greater
than        the    cell       density           of      band      3310.            When       subjected          to
outward        radial         force       from       the      balloon,           expansion           band      3314
will       thus    expand         in    radial         direction           RD    more      than        expansion
band 3310 will expand.                       Expansion band 3316 has                          the      same cell
density as           expansion band                3314.         Expansion band 3318 has                        the
greatest         cell        density         and        therefore           may       expand         in      radial
direction         RD    more     than the other expansion bands.
 [0317]           The      longitudinal               variation            in     cell       density          along
longitudinal             anchoring          substrate            3340     may      result        in      a   radial
expansion          that       varies.             Cell       density,           band      width          (such   as

                                               -   71
band  3316 width          3318)       and band         position       along     axis     LD   may be
chosen   to   provide        an    expanded           contour      of    anchoring       substrate
3304 that conforms            in a desired way to a                    support cage          such as
105  (shown     in    FIG.      1)    or     an    intramedullary            space    such      as   IS
 (shown in    FIG.      1) .      Circumferential variations                      (in direction
CD)  in   cell      density         may       provide         circumferentially              varying
expansion     radii.          Such      variations           may   be    used    to    provide       an
anchoring     substrate          that      has      a   contour       that     corresponds          to,
or  contours       with,      an     asymmetric           intramedullary           cavity,         such
as at the end of a humerus.
[0318]       FIG.      34    shows       illustrative anchoring substrate                          3402
for   a    fracture           repair          device          in    accordance          with        the
principles of the            invention.             Anchoring substrate 3402 may be
supported      at    distal         end       3404      by     flange       3406.        Anchoring
substrate      3402      may      be      supported           at   proximal       end      3408      by
flange 3410.          Central         axis     member        3412   may be      longitudinally
fixed to    flange 3406.                Flange        3410 may be          substantially free
to  translate      with      respect to            central       axis member        3412.          This
allows   distance         T    between          the     flanges       to    decrease        so     that
anchoring substrate 3402 can expand in radial direction                                        RD.
[0319]       Device         3400        may       be      self-expanding.                Anchoring
substrate       3402        may         include          braided         mesh.            In       some
embodiments,         device         3400        may       include        multiple        anchoring
substrates.
[0320]       FIG.        35     shows         anchoring          substrate         3414        in    an
expanded    state       between         flanges         3406     and     3410.      Flange         3410
has   been      moved        distally            up      central        axis     member         3412.
Anchoring     substrate           3414      corresponds           to    anchoring        substrate
3402    (shown      in     FIG.        34),      but      may     have       a  longitudinally

                                                       -   72
varying         cell       density         and      may      therefore          expand       to     a   greater
radius then can anchoring substrate 3402.
 [0321]            After        anchors            are       attached          to     anchor         substrate
3414,        flange         3410       may       be      drawn     proximally             to     reduce         the
diameter          of     the     substrate            and     apply     a     tensile         force      to     the
attached          anchor         elements.               During      such        diameter          reduction,
the       shape        of     the       cells         in     anchoring           substrate            3414      may
change.           For      example,         the       cells      may,     in     the    expanded         state,
be      generally            square.               In      the    contracted              (or      relatively
contracted)               state,          the       cells        may       be       diamond-shaped               or
trapezoidal.                The      shape       change        may    increase          the     strength         of
the      engagement            between           the      anchoring          substrate           3414.          The
shape        change       may      effectively              lock   the       anchor       into       anchoring
substrate 3414.
 [0322]            FIG.      36     shows       illustrative anchoring substrate                             3600
for        a    fracture             repair           device       in        accordance             with        the
principles of the                   invention.              Anchoring substrate 3600 may be
attached          to     a    central          axis       member       (not       shown).            Anchoring
substrate            3600      may      be      welded,         crimped,          woven       or     otherwise
attached         to     the     central          axis       member     along         the    length       of     the
central         axis       member.            For       example,       radially           inner        portions
3602 may be attached to the central axis member.
 [0323]            In     some       embodiments,              anchoring          substrate           3600      may
be      attached          at    its      distal          and    proximal           ends      to     a   central
member        such      as    124      (shown       in     FIG.   1)    and      along      its      length      to
a    structural           cage      such      as      105     (shown     in     FIG.      1) .      This     type
of     attachment           may      to    facilitate            wrapping          or   folding         through
relative          rotation          between           the     cage    and       central         member.          In
some       embodiments,               anchoring             substrate          3600     may      be     present

                                                 -   73
within       a   structural           cage    such     as    105     (shown       in    FIG.     1),   but
may be unattached or uncoupled to the structural cage.
 [0324]           Anchoring            substrate           3600       may        have       sufficient
elasticity          to    retain       folds    3603.         Surfaces         3604      and radially
outer        portions          3606      may    engage         anchors          that       press      bone
segments         against         a   support       cage     such     as     105      (shown      in   FIG.
1).         Anchoring          substrate        3600       may     include        secondary          folds
3608 to increase the                   availability of surfaces                    3604 to receive
anchors.
 [0325]           The     central axis member may be rotated in direction
 -CD    to draw       the     anchors      inward       in   direction          -RD    approximately
toward the           central        axis member.            The     central        axis member may
be     drawn     proximally           to   apply      longitudinal            force       to   the    bone
segments.
 [0326]           FIG.      37    shows    illustrative anchoring substrate                           3700
for        a    fracture           repair       device         in      accordance            with      the
principles of the                 invention.          Anchoring substrate 3700 may be
constructed,            attached         to   a   central        axis      member       and     actuated
as    is anchoring substrate                  3600      (shown in FIG.             36).      Anchoring
substrate          3700      may      include       primary         folds      3702.         Anchoring
substrate          3700      may    not    include        secondary          folds      such     as   3608
in anchoring substrate 3600.
 [0327]           Some       embodiments           may     include         threadlike           elements
that       are   intertwined            with    anchoring          substrate          3600     and/or    a
structural            cage        such     as     105       (shown        in     FIG.       1).        The
threadlike           elements          may    be     connected          to     the     central        axis
member         to     facilitate           drawing         portions           of     the      anchoring
substrate or structural                    cage toward the device axis.                           In some

 [0328]           FIG.     38     shows       illustrative anchoring substrate                               3800
for       a    fracture            repair          device           in      accordance             with        the
principles of the                 invention.             Anchoring substrate 3800 may be
attached         to    a    central          axis      member          (not       shown) .          Anchoring
substrate          3800     may      be    welded,         crimped           or    otherwise          attached
to the       central axis member near a proximal end of the central
axis       member.            For        example,           radially            inner       and       proximal
portions         3802      may      be     attached           to     the      central        axis      member.
Anchoring         substrate          may      have      sufficient             elasticity          to    retain
helical        folds      3803.          Folded surfaces                 3804      may engage          anchors
that      press     bone      segments           against         a    support         cage     such     as     105
 (shown in FIG.            1).
 [0329]           Distal        end      3808      of      anchoring            member        3800      may     be
fixed       to    a   flange,          such      as     3406        (shown        in     FIG.     35) .        The
central        axis      member        may      be    free       to     rotate         in   direction           -CD
with      respect to          the     flange.           When       the     central         axis member is
so    rotated,        it     may      tighten         helical          folds        3803     and     draw      the
anchors         inward        in      direction            -RD      approximately               toward         the
central        axis      member.            The     central          axis      member        may     be    drawn
proximally to apply longitudinal force to the bone segments.

for       a    fracture            repair          device           in      accordance             with        the
principles of the                 invention.             Anchoring substrate may include
stacked disc-like folds                      3902.         Disc-like           folds may expand and
contract         longitudinally                 and      radially            in     an     accordion-like
fashion.

 [0331]           FIG.       40    shows      anchoring          substrate             3900      in     cross
section as viewed along lines                          40-40       (shown in FIG.               39).        When
proximal         end    3904      and distal          end 3906           (e.g.,       at    flange        3908)
are      displaced           longitudinally              toward        each         other,        anchoring
substrate           3900       may      compress          longitudinally                and       disc-like
folds 3902 may expand in direction                              RD.      When proximal end 3904
and      distal       end      3906       (e.g.,       at    flange          3908)       are      displaced
longitudinally away from each other, anchoring substrate                                                    3900
may       extend        longitudinally               and       disc-like             folds        3902        may
contract in direction                    -RD.
 [0332]           The     longitudinal            extension           may        be    used      to     deploy
anchoring          substrate          in    a   radially          compressed            state.            After
deployment,              anchoring            substrate            may          be      longitudinally
compressed          so    that      folds      3902     expand        in     radial       direction            RD.
Anchors         may     then       be     engaged        with       folds         3902.           Anchoring
substrate         3900       may    then      be    longitudinally                extended          to    apply
radially         inward        force      to   the     anchors.             Tension        in     direction
DP may then be applied to the anchors by pulling proximal end
3904.       Folds 3902 may be biased at angle B in direction -De so
that      when     end     3904      is    pulled,        fold      axes        Lf    are     pre-aligned
with the anchors.
 [0333]           Proximal          portion        3904      may      be      attached          to     a    pull
member        (not     shown)        that      may     be     similar           to    a   portion          of     a
central         axis      member         such     as      124      (as       shown       in      FIG.       1B).
Distal end 3906, at flange 3908,                            may be attached to a portion
of      the      device         that       remains         substantially                longitudinally
stationary           when       the     pull     device        pulls         on     proximal          portion
3904.         For    example,          flange       3908     may      be     fixed       to    the      distal
end      of   a   corresponding              support        cage       such       as    105       (shown        in
FIG.      1).

the     invention.              Support          cage       4100     may     include       hub      4102       and
base      ring      4104.         Spiral         support         members        4106    extend        between
hub      4102      and      base      ring        4104.          A   central        axis     member           (not
shown)        may      extend        along         device        axis      LD.      The    central           axis
member may have                a distal           end that          is    longitudinally fixed to
hub     4102.          The     central         axis       member       may      extend      through          base

In    some      embodiments,              support           cage     4100      may    be    expanded           and
collapsed by application of an external rotational                                              force.
[0336]             In some embodiments,                      support cage 4100 may be self
expanding.              In   those       embodiments,              support        cage    4100       may have
a   relaxed         state       that      is      longitudinally              compressed.              Support
cage       4100       may      be     longitudinally                 extended         for      deployment.
Support        cage       4100     may     then       return       to    its     relaxed      state        after
deployment.

Thread   segments       5006 may have              some     or     all      of the       features       of

                                        -   83
thread segments 4906          (shown in FIG. 49).               For example, thread
segments    5006      may   include        circumferential           faces    5008    and
corresponding           circumferential               locking          faces        5010.
Circumferential locking faces 5010 may catch in the anchoring
substrate     and    prevent    anchor        5000    from    unscrewing       from   the
anchoring substrate.
[0358]       Anchor      5000   may     be     deployed       using     torque,     axial
pressure or both.
[0359]       Anchor      5000   may     include        articulating        catch    5012.
Articulating        catch    5012     may       in   a    non-deployed        state    be
present in lumen 5014 of elongated member 5002.                           Rod 5014 may
be depressed in        lumen 5014       and may push on leg 5018               of catch
5012.     Leg     5018    may  urge      hinge      5020     out    of  port    5022   in
elongated     member      5002.        Corresponding           catch     5024    may   be
deployed in a similar fashion.                   Legs    5018 and 5026 may catch
in  the   anchoring      substrate       after      deployment       of  catches     5012
and   5024.      Anchor    5000   may      thus    be   locked     to   the   anchoring
substrate.
[0360]       FIG.    51   shows   illustrative          anchor      5100   that may be
used   with    a   fracture     repair       device      in   accordance      with    the
principles of the invention.                  Anchor 5100 may include             spiral
member 5102,       head 5104 and notches 5106.                   Anchor 5100 may be
deployed using torque, axial pressure or both.
[0361]       Elongated      member        5102     may    be   inserted      through     a
bone   segment.       A pilot hole          in   the bone       segment     may   have   a
diameter    corresponding        to diameter          d of     spiral    member     5102.
Spiral   member      5102   may    thus      pass     through      the   bone    segment
without substantial rotation.                  In some embodiments, an anchor
access   hole    in   the bone could be made                for anchor      5100.     The

                                                        -   84
anchor         access        hole      may       have        a    diameter           that      is     no    smaller
than diameter d'                  of elongated member 5102 and is                                  large enough
to    allow      elongated member                     5102      to    be    helically            threaded      thru
the hole.            Such an access hole may be smaller than a standard
anchor hole.
 [0362]           Tip       5108       may     then         engage        the      anchoring           substrate.
Rotation of anchor 5100 may then drive anchor 5100                                                     relatively
deeper        into      the      anchoring            substrate.              Notches         5106       may catch
in     the      anchoring             substrate              and      prevent            anchor        5100    from
rotating out of engagement with the                                       anchoring substrate.                   End
portion         5110      may be         provided            without         notches          so    that     anchor
5100        may     be       backed         out         of      the       anchoring            substrate,          if
desired,            before            driving              anchor           5100          into         a     locked
relationship with the anchoring substrate.
 [0363]           FIG.        52    shows        illustrative              anchor         5200      that     may be
used       with      a    fracture           repair          device         in     accordance             with   the
principles             of       the      invention.                    Anchor           5200       may      include
elongated         member          5202,       head        5204      and     catch        5206.         Catch 5206
may be supported by and rotatable                                    about pin 5208.                   Catch 5206
may in a nondeployed state be present                                        or partially present in
slot       5210    in elongated member                        5202.         For      example,          catch   5206
may      rotate        in     direction             m     such      that       tip      5212      rotates      into
slot       5210     and      tip      5214      rotates           into     a     position         that      extends
beyond elongated member 5202.
 [0364]           In      such      a   configuration,                   elongated          member        5202   may
be     inserted           through          a      bone        segment.               Tip      5214       may   then
traverse         a     portion          of     the        anchoring           substrate.                After    the
traverse,          tip      5214       may     rotate          in    the     -m     direction            such  that
anchor         5200      returns         to      the       configuration                shown      in     FIG.   52.
The     span     of      catch       5206 may exceed the                        diameter of             a  cell    in

                                           -   85
the  anchoring substrate.                 Anchor      5200    may thus be       locked to
the anchoring substrate.
[0365]        In   some      embodiments,           screw-actuator         5216    may   be
present     in   bore       5218    of      elongated        member     5202.        Screw
actuator     5216 may be screwed              into the bore.           This action may
reduce    the    effective        length        of   anchor     5200    and,     therefore
tension    the bone        segment       to   the    anchor      substrate.        In  some
embodiments,       a   tip     (not     shown)       of    screw-actuator        5216   may
deflect    tip 5212       out of slot 5210             to rotate catch         5206.    Tip
5212  may    be   beveled       to   facilitate          deflection      by   the   tip  of
screw-actuator 5216.
[0366]        FIG. 53 shows anchors 5200 deployed and locked into
anchoring substrate 112 of device 100                        (shown also in FIG. 1).
Anchors 5200 thus fasten bone segments Pa and Ph to anchoring
substrate 112.
[0367]        FIG.    54    shows     illustrative           fracture     repair     device
5400   in    accordance        with       the    principles        of   the    invention.
Device 5400 is implanted in bone B.                        Wire 5402 passes through
holes   that     are    drilled       through        bone     segment     Pa,    anchoring
substrate     5404    and     bone    segment       PB    to   form   loop    5406.     The
ends  of    wire    5402     may   be      fastened       to   each   other     to   secure
bone portions Pa,         Ph  and   PB    to each other.
[0368]        FIG.    55    shows     illustrative           fracture     repair     device
5500   in    accordance        with       the    principles        of   the    invention.
Device    5500     is    shown     deployed          and     locked    in    humerus    BH.
Support     members      5502     generally         conform      to   the   contours     of
intramedullary        space      IS     in     bone     BH.      Anchoring       substrate
applies     tension      in    direction         Dp   to    anchors    5504     and   5506.
Proximal anchor 5508 retains the tension.

[0369]       Expanding         cylindrical           anchor       5510     is      present
coaxially    about    structural        cage      base    5512.      Anchor 5510 may
expand   radially     when      compressed        along     axis    LD.    When      anchor
5510   expands,      circumferential            blades       5514    extend       radially
into bone    BH.    Anchor 5510 may be compressed by longitudinally
fixing distal      end 5516 at a position                on structural         cage base
5512   and   pushing     distally       on    proximal        end   5518.       A    detent
 (not  shown)     may    be    provided        to    prevent       anchor     5510     from
extending     longitudinally.              When      locked      in    the   compressed
state, anchor 5510 cuts into bone                  BH  and locks device 5500, or
parts   thereof,      longitudinally.               Anchor      5510    may     be    self
expanding when released from constraint.                        Anchor 5510 may be
rotated during expansion to promote engagement with the bone.
[0370]       Expanding         cylindrical            anchor        5522     is       shown
connected    directly to anchoring               substrate       5530.     Anchor 5522
may be    locked    after     a desired        tension      is   obtained      in    device
5500.    Expanding cylindrical anchor 5522 may have some or all
of the features of expanding cylindrical anchor 5510.
[0371]       FIG.    56A    shows    illustrative           expanding      anchor      5600
that   may   be   used    in    accordance         with    the   principles         of  the
invention.      Anchor     5600 may have           some or all        of the features
of  anchor    5510    (shown      in FIG.       55) .    Anchor      5600   may be      cut
from a tube.       Compression along axis              LD   causes articulation of
living   hinge     5604.       The   articulation          causes     blades       5602  to
extend radially away from axis                  LD.    Anchor 5600 may be self
expanding.
[0372]       FIG. 56B shows a view of anchor 5600 from direction
56B-56B    (shown in FIG. 56A).              FIG. 56C shows a view of anchor
5600 from direction 56C-56C               (shown in FIG. 56A).

[0373]             FIG.       57A      shows         illustrative              expanding          helical
anchor          5700      that       may       be     used        in     accordance           with      the
principles            of   the     invention.             Helical        anchor         5700   may    have
some       or    all     of    the    features          of     anchor      5510       (shown     in   FIG.
55).        Anchor       5700    may be        cut     from a      tube.         Compression         along
axis        LD    causes        articulation             of     living        hinge       5704.         The
articulation             causes      blades       5702      to    extend       radially       away    from
axis LD.          Anchor 5700 may be self-expanding.
[0374]             FIG.     57B    shows a view of               anchor 5700 from direction
57B-57B         (shown in FIG.            57A).         FIG. 57C       shows a view of anchor
5700 from direction 57C-57C                         (shown in FIG. 56A).
[0375]             When      helical        anchor        5700      is     rotated         relative      to
surrounding             bone,     it    may     move       like     a    screw       because       of   the
helical         form      of    blades       5702.          When     helical          anchor     5700    is
rotated         compressed           and     rotated          simultaneously,             blades      5702
may       carve        out    bone      material           while      anchor          5700     is    being
engaged         in      the    bone.         Carving           out    the      bone      material       may
reduce hoop stress in the bone.

invention            in  femur BF.           Device        5800    includes          structural       cage
5802       and       anchoring         substrate           5804.          Anchors         5806      fasten
portions          (individual         bone      segments         not     shown)        of   femur    BF  to
anchoring            substrate       5804.          Structural          cage      5800     may    include
cage      base        5808    which      may     be     configured           to   receive       proximal
anchor         5810.          Proximal         anchor         5810     may       apply      tension      to
central         axis      member       5812.          Proximal        anchor         5810     may    apply
tension to anchoring substrate 5804.
