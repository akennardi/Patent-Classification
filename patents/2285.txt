                              Cross-reference to Related Applications
The present application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn> which is a
divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2012285987 which is the national phase of
PCT/EP2012/063552 which claims priority to US 61/509,397 and EP 111/74578.2, the entire contents
of each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                    Background of the invention
B lymphocyte activation is key in the generation of adaptive immune responses. Derailed B
lymphocyte activation is a hallmark of many autoimmune diseases and modulation of this immune
response is therefore of therapeutic interest. Recently the success of B cell therapies in autoimmune
diseases has been established. Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with Rituximab (anti
CD20 therapy) is an accepted clinical therapy by now. More recent clinical trial studies show that
treatment with Rituximab also ameliorates disease symptoms in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis
(RRMS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. This success supports the potential for
future therapies in autoimmune diseases targeting B cell immunity.
Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a Tec family non-receptor protein kinase, expressed in B cells and
myeloid cells. The function of Btk in signaling pathways activated by the engagement of the B cell
receptor (BCR) and FccR1 on mast cells is well established. In addition, a function for Btk as a
downstream target in Toll like receptor signaling was suggested. Functional mutations in Btk in human
results in the primary immunodeficiency disease called XLA which is characterized by a defect in B
cell development with a block between pro- and pre-B cell stage. This results in an almost complete
absence of B lymphocytes in human causing a pronounced reduction of serum immunoglobulin of all
classes. These finding support the key role for Btk in the regulation of the production of auto
antibodies in autoimmune diseases. In addition, regulation of Btk may affect BCR-induced production
of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by B cells, indicating a broad potential for Btk in the
treatment of autoimmune diseases.

                                                    2
With the regulatory role reported for Btk in FcER-mediated mast cell activation, Btk inhibitors may also
show potential in the treatment of allergic responses [Gilfillan et al, Immunological Reviews 288
(2009) pp149-169].
Furthermore, Btk is also reported to be implicated in RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation
[Shinohara et al, Cell 132 (2008) pp7 94 -806] and therefore may also be of interest for the treatment of
bone resorption disorders.

                                                          3
   Other diseases with an important role for dysfunctional B cells are B cell malignancies. Indeed anti-CD20
   therapy is used effectively in the clinic for the treatment of follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell
   lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [Lim et al, Haematologica, 95 (2010) ppl35-143]. The
   reported role for Btk in the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis of B cells indicates there is potential
 5 for Btk inhibitors in the treatment of B cell lymphomas as well. Inhibition of Btk seems to be relevant in
   particular for B cell lymphomas due to chronic active BCR signaling [Davis et al, Nature, 463 (2010) pp88
   94].
   Some classes of 6-5 membered fused pyridine ring compounds have been described as kinase inhibitors
10 e.g.    Imidazo[1,5-f][1,2,4]triazine   compounds      have    been    described   in  W02005097800       and
   W02007064993;. Imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazine           compounds have been described in W02005037836 and
   W02001019828 as IGF-1R enzyme inhibitors.
   Some of the Btk inhibitors reported are not selective over Src-family kinases. With dramatic adverse
15 effects reported for knockouts of Src-family kinases, especially for double and triple knockouts, this is
   seen as prohibitive for the development of Btk inhibitors that are not selective over the Src-family kinases.
   Both Lyn-deficient and Fyn-deficient mice exhibit autoimmunity mimicking the phenotype of human lupus
   nephritis. In addition, Fyn-deficient mice also show pronounced neurological defects. Lyn knockout mice
   also show an allergic-like phenotype, indicating Lyn as a broad negative regulator of the IgE-mediated
20 allergic response by controlling mast cell responsiveness and allergy-associated traits [Odom et al, J.
   Exp.    Med., 199     (2004) ppl491-1502]. Furthermore, aged           Lyn knock-out mice develop severe
   splenomegaly (myeloid expansion) and disseminated monocyte/macrophage tumors [Harder et al,
   Immunity, 15 (2001) pp603-6 1 5]. These observations are in line with hyperresponsive B cells, mast cells
   and myeloid cells, and increased Ig levels observed in Lyn-deficient mice.
25 Female Src knockout mice are infertile due to reduced follicle development and ovulation [Roby et al,
   Endocrine, 26 (2005) pp1 69- 1 7 6].
   The double knockouts Src-'-Fyn-'- and Src-'-Yes-'- show a severe phenotype with effects on movement and
   breathing. The triple knockouts Src-'-Fyn-'-Yes-'- die at day 9.5 [Klinghoffer et al, EMBO J., 18 (1999)
   pp2459-2471]. For the double knockout Src-'-Hck-'-, two thirds of the mice die at birth, with surviving mice
30 developing osteopetrosis, extramedullary hematopoiseis, anemia, leukopenia [Lowell et al, Blood, 87
   (1996) ppl780-1 7 92 ].
   Hence, an inhibitor that inhibits multiple or all kinases of the Src-family kinases simultaneously may cause
   serious adverse effects.

   The invention also relates to those compounds wherein all specific definitions for R1 through R14 and all
30 substituent groups in the various aspects of the inventions defined here above occur in any combination
   within the definition of the 6-5 membered fused pyridine ring compounds i.e. 8-amino-imidazo[1,5
   a]pyrazine and 4-amino-imidazo[1,5-f][1,2,4]triazine compounds of formula 1.
   The 6-5 membered fused pyridine ring compounds like 8-amino-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazine and 4-amino
35 imidazo[1,5-f][1,2,4]triazine compounds of the invention inhibit the Btk kinase activity. All compounds of
   the invention have an EC50 of 10 pM or lower.

                                                      18
   In another aspect the invention relates to compounds of formula I which have an EC50 of less than 100
   nM. In yet another aspect the invention relates to compounds of formula I which have an EC50 of less
   than 10 nM.
   The term EC50 means the concentration of the test compound that is required for 50% inhibition of its
 5 maximum effect in vitro.
   Inhibition of kinase activity can be measured using the Immobilized Metal Assay for Phosphochemicals
   (IMAP) assay. IMAP is a homogeneous fluorescence polarization (FP) assay based on affinity capture of
   phosphorylated peptide substrates. IMAP uses fluorescein-labeled peptide substrates that, upon
   phosphorylation by a protein kinase, bind to so-called IMAP nanoparticles, which are derivatized with
10 trivalent metal complexes. Binding causes a change in the rate of the molecular motion of the peptide,
   and results in an increase in the FP value observed for the fluorescein label attached to the substrate
   peptide (Gaudet et al. A homogeneous fluorescence polarization assay adaptable for a range of protein
   serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. J. Biomol. Screen (2003) 8, 164-175).
15 The compounds of Formula (I) can form salts which are also within the scope of this invention. Reference
   to a compound of Formula (I) herein is understood to include reference to salts thereof, unless otherwise
   indicated.   The term "salt(s)", as employed herein, denotes acidic salts formed with inorganic and/or
   organic acids, as well as basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic bases. In addition, when a
   compound of Formula (I) contains both a basic moiety, such as, but not limited to a pyridine or imidazole,
20 and an acidic moiety, such as, but not limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions ("inner salts") may be
   formed and are included within the term "salt(s)" as used herein. Such acidic and basic salts used within
   the scope of the invention are pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable)
   salts. Salts of the compounds of Formula (I) may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of
   Formula (I) with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in
25 which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization.
   Exemplary acid addition salts include acetates, ascorbates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates,
   borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates, fumarates, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides,
   hydroiodides,    lactates,   maleates,  methanesulfonates,    naphthalenesulfonates,    nitrates, oxalates,
   phosphates, propionates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates, tartarates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates
30 (also known as tosylates,) and the like. Additionally, acids which are generally considered suitable for the
   formation of pharmaceutically useful salts from basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, for
   example, by P. Stahl et al, Camille G. (eds.) Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts. Properties, Selection and
   Use. (2002) Zurich: Wiley-VCH; S. Berge et al, Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences (1977) 66(1) 1-19; P.
   Gould, International J. of Pharmaceutics (1986) 33 201-217; Anderson et al, The Practice of Medicinal
35 Chemistry (1996), Academic Press, New York; and in The Orange Book (Food & Drug Administration,
   Washington, D.C. on their website). These disclosures are incorporated herein by reference.
   Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium
   salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases (for

                                                        19
   example, organic amines) such as dicyclohexylamines, t-butyl amines, and salts with amino acids such
   as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quarternized with agents such
   as lower alkyl halides (e.g., methyl, ethyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates
   (e.g., dimethyl, diethyl, and dibutyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g., decyl, lauryl, and stearyl chlorides,
 5 bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g., benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others.
   The compounds of Formula I may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and, therefore, exist in different
   stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) as well
   as mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention.            In addition, the
10 present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example, if a compound of Formula
   (I) incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are
   embraced within the scope of the invention.
   Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their
   physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, by
15 chromatography and/or fractional crystallization.       Enantiomers can be separated by converting the
   enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active
   compound (e.g. chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the
   diastereomers and converting (e.g. hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure
   enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of Formula (I) may be atropisomers (e.g. substituted biaryls)
20 and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of chiral HPLC
   column.
   It is also possible that the compounds of Formula (I) may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such
   forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine
   forms of the compounds are included in the invention.
25 All stereoisomers (for example, geometric isomers, optical isomers and the like) of the present
   compounds (including those of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs of the compounds as well as the
   salts, solvates and esters of the prodrugs), such as those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on
   various substituents, including enantiomeric forms (which may exist even in the absence of asymmetric
   carbons), rotameric forms, atropisomers, and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of
30 this invention, as are positional isomers. Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may,
   for example, be substantially free of other isomers, or may be admixed, for example, as racemates or with
   all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention can have the S or R
   configuration as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations. The use of the terms "salt", "solvate",
   "ester", "prodrug" and the like, is intended to equally apply to the salt, solvate, ester and prodrug of
35 enantiomers, stereoisomers, rotamers, tautomers, positional isomers, racemates or prodrugs of the
   inventive compounds.

                                                         20
   A discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems
   (1987) 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, (1987) Edward
   B. Roche, ed., American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press. The term "prodrug" means a
   compound (e.g, a drug precursor) that is transformed in vivo to yield a compound of Formula (I) or a
 5 pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound. The transformation may occur by
   various mechanisms (e.g. by metabolic or chemical processes), such as, for example, through hydrolysis
   in blood.     A discussion of the use of prodrugs is provided by T. Higuchi and W. Stella, "Pro-drugs as
   Novel Delivery Systems," Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug
   Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987.
10 The compounds of the invention may form hydrates or solvates. It is known to those of skill in the art that
   charged compounds form hydrated species when lyophilized with water, or form solvated species when
   concentrated in a solution with an appropriate organic solvent. The compounds of this invention include
   the hydrates or solvates of the compounds listed.
   One or more compounds of the invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with
15 pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the
   invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms. "Solvate" means a physical association of a
   compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules. This physical association involves
   varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the
   solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in
20 the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. "Solvate" encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable
   solvates. Non-limiting examples of suitable solvates include ethanolates, methanolates, and the like.
   "Hydrate" is a solvate wherein the solvent molecule is H2 0.
   The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising 6-5 membered fused
   pyridine ring compounds like imidazopyrazine and imidazotriazine compounds or pharmaceutically
25 acceptable salts thereof having the general formula I in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable
   auxiliaries and optionally other therapeutic agents. The auxiliaries must be "acceptable" in the sense of
   being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipients
   thereof.
   The invention further includes a compound of formula I in combination with one or more other drug(s).
30 Compositions include e.g. those suitable for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular,
   nasal, local, or rectal administration, and the like, all in unit dosage forms for administration.
   For oral administration, the active ingredient may be presented as discrete units, such as tablets,
   capsules, powders, granulates, solutions, suspensions, and the like.
   For parenteral administration, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be presented in unit
35 dose or multi-dose containers, e.g. injection liquids in predetermined amounts, for example in sealed vials
   and ampoules, and may also be stored in a freeze dried lyophilizedd) condition requiring only the addition
   of sterile liquid carrier, e.g. water, prior to use.

                                                      21
   Mixed with such pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries, e.g. as described in the standard reference,
   Gennaro, A.R. et al., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20th Edition., Lippincott
   Williams & Wilkins, 2000, see especially Part 5: Pharmaceutical Manufacturing), the active agent may be
   compressed into solid dosage units, such as pills, tablets, or be processed into capsules or suppositories.
 5 By means of pharmaceutically acceptable liquids the active agent can be applied as a fluid composition,
   e.g. as an injection preparation, in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, or as a spray, e.g. a
   nasal spray.
   For making solid dosage units, the use of conventional additives such as fillers, colorants, polymeric
   binders and the like is contemplated. In general any pharmaceutically acceptable additive which does not
10 interfere with the function of the active compounds can be used. Suitable carriers with which the active
   agent of the invention can be administered as solid compositions include lactose, starch, cellulose
   derivatives and the like, or mixtures thereof, used in suitable amounts. For parenteral administration,
   aqueous suspensions, isotonic saline solutions and sterile injectable solutions may be used, containing
   pharmaceutically acceptable dispersing agents and/or wetting agents, such as propylene glycol or
15 butylene glycol.
   The invention further includes a pharmaceutical composition, as hereinbefore described, in combination
   with packaging material suitable for said composition, said packaging material including instructions for
   the use of the composition for the use as hereinbefore described.
20 The exact dose and regimen of administration of the active ingredient, or a pharmaceutical composition
   thereof, may vary with the particular compound, the route of administration, and the age and condition of
   the individual subject to whom the medicament is to be administered.
    In general parenteral administration requires lower dosages than other methods of administration which
   are more dependent upon absorption. However, a dosage for humans preferably contains 0.0001-25 mg
25 per kg body weight. The desired dose may be presented as one dose or as multiple subdoses
   administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day, or, in case of female recipients, as doses to be
   administered at appropriate daily intervals throughout the menstrual cycle. The dosage as well as the
   regimen of administration may differ between a female and a male recipient.
30  In the compounds of generic Formula I, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one
   or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number,
   but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found
   in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of
   generic Formula 1. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (H) and
35 deuterium (2H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium
   may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage
   requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples.
    Isotopically-enriched   compounds     within generic   Formula    I can   be   prepared    without undue

   experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes
   analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically
   enriched reagents and/or intermediates.
 5 The compounds according to the invention can be used in therapy.
   A further aspect of the invention resides in the use of 6-5 membered fused pyridine ring compounds or a
   pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, having the general formula I for the manufacture of a
   medicament to be used for the treatment of Btk-mediated diseases or Btk-mediated conditions.
10 A further aspect of the invention resides in the use of 6-5 membered fused pyridine ring compounds or a
   pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof having the general formula I for the manufacture of a
   medicament to be used for the treatment of chronic B cell disorders in which T cells play a prominent role.
   In yet another aspect the invention resides in the use of 6-5 membered fused pyridine ring compounds
   like 8-amino-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazine and 4-amino-imidazo[1,5-f][1,2,4]triazine compounds having the
15 general formula I for the manufacture of a medicament to be used for the treatment of Btk-mediated
   diseases or conditions. These include, but are not limited to, the treatment of B cell lymphomas resulting
   from chronic active B cell receptor signaling.
   Thus, the compounds according to the invention can be used in therapies to treat or prevent diseases
20 Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (Btk) mediated disorders. Btk mediated disorders or Btk mediated condition as
   used herein, mean any disease state or other deleterious condition in which B cells, mast cells, myeloid
   cells or osteoclasts play a central role. These diseases include but are not limited to, immune,
   autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, allergies, infectious diseases, bone resorption disorders and
   proliferative diseases.
25 Immune, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases that can be treated or prevented with the compounds of
   the present invention include rheumatic diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, infectious
   arthritis, progressive chronic arthritis, deforming arthritis, osteoarthritis, traumatic arthritis, gouty arthritis,
   Reiter's syndrome, polychondritis, acute synovitis and spondylitis), glomerulonephritis (with or without
   nephrotic syndrome), autoimmune hematologic disorders (e.g. hemolytic anemia, aplasic anemia,
30 idiopathic thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia), autoimmune gastritis, and autoimmune inflammatory
   bowel diseases (e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), host versus graft disease, allograft rejection,
   chronic thyroiditis, Graves' disease, schleroderma, diabetes (type I and type II), active hepatitis (acute
   and chronic), pancreatitis, primary billiary cirrhosis, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus
   erythematosis, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, skin sunburns, vasculitis (e.g.
35 Behcet's disease) chronic renal insufficiency, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, inflammatory pain, idiopathic
   sprue, cachexia, sarcoidosis, Guillain-Barr6 syndrome, uveitis, conjunctivitis, kerato conjunctivitis, otitis
   media,     periodontal disease,   pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, asthma,         bronchitis, rhinitis, sinusitis,
   pneumoconiosis, pulmonary insufficiency syndrome, pulmonary emphysema,                        pulmonary fibrosis,

                                                          23
   silicosis, chronic inflammatory pulmonary disease (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and other
   inflammatory or obstructive disease on airways.
   Allergies that can be treated or prevented include, among others, allergies to foods, food additives, insect
   poisons, dust mites, pollen, animal materials and contact allergans, type I hypersensitivity allergic
 5 asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis.
   Infectious diseases that can be treated or prevented include, among others, sepsis, septic shock,
   endotoxic shock, sepsis by Gram-negative bacteria, shigellosis, meningitis, cerebral malaria, pneumonia,
   tuberculosis, viral myocarditis, viral hepatitis (hepatitis A,     hepatitis B and hepatitis C), HIV infection,
   retinitis caused by cytomegalovirus, influenza, herpes, treatment of infections associated with severe
10 burns, myalgias caused by infections, cachexia secondary to infections, and veterinary viral infections
   such as lentivirus, caprine arthritic virus, visna-maedi virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, bovine
   immunodeficiency virus or canine immunodeficiency virus.
   Bone resorption disorders that can be treated or prevented include, among others, osteoporosis,
   osteoarthritis, traumatic arthritis, gouty arthritis and bone disorders related with multiple myeloma.
15 Proliferative diseases that can be treated or prevented include, among others, non-Hodgkin lymphoma
   (in particular the subtypes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)), B
   cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with mature B cell, ALL in
   particular.
   In particular compounds of the invention can be used for the treatment of B cell lymphomas resulting from
20 chronic active B cell receptor signaling.
   Inhibition of kinase activity can be measured using the Immobilized Metal Assay for Phosphochemicals
   (IMAP) assay. IMAP is a homogeneous fluorescence polarization (FP) assay based on affinity capture of
   phosphorylated peptide substrates. IMAP uses fluorescein-labeled peptide substrates that, upon
25 phosphorylation by a protein kinase, bind to so-called IMAP nanoparticles, which are derivatized with
   trivalent metal complexes. Binding causes a change in the rate of the molecular motion of the peptide,
   and results in an increase in the FP value observed for the fluorescein label attached to the substrate
   peptide.
30 The Btk activity can also be determined in B cell lines such as Ramos cells or in primary cell assays, e.g
   PBMC or whole blood from human, monkey, rat or mouse or isolated splenocytes from monkey, rat or
   mouse. Inhibition of Btk activity can be investigated measuring anti-IgM-induced MIP1@ production
   (Ramos, PBMC, splenocytes), H2 0 2-induced Btk and PLCy2 phosphorylation (Ramos cells), or anti-IgM
   induced B cell proliferation or CD86 expression on primary B cells (PBMC and splenocytes).
35 Regulation of Btk activity can also be determined on human, monkey, rat or mouse mast cells following
   activation FcER induced degranulation, cytokine production and CD63 induced cell surface expression.
   Furthermore, regulation of Btk activity can be determined on CD14+ monocytes differentiated following
   treatment with M-CSF to osteoclasts and activated with RANKL.

                                                         24
   Activity of Btk inhibitors can be investigated in mouse splenocytes following administration in vivo. In a
   typical experiment mice can be euthanized 3h following compound administration. Spleens can be
   extracted from the treated mice for splenocyte isolation. Splenocytes can be plated in 96 well culture
 5 plates and stimulated with anti-IgM, without further addition of compounds. Anti-IgM-induced B cell
   stimulation and inhibition thereof by Btk inhibitors can be measured by B cell proliferation, MIP1@
   production or CD86 expression on CD19+ splenocyte B cells.
   Efficacy of Btk inhibitors can also be investigated in the mouse collagen induced arthritis model using a
   therapeutic protocol with start of treatment following onset of disease, measuring disease score, X-ray
10 analysis of bone destruction, cartilage breakdown and histology of joints
   Efficacy of Btk inhibitors on the regulation of activated mast cells can be investigated in vivo using the
   passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model.
   The effect of Btk inhibitors on bone resorption in vivo can be investigated using the rat OVX model. In this
   model ovariectomized animals develop symptoms of osteoporosis that may be regulated using a Btk
15 inhibitor.
                                                General Synthesis
   The 8-amino-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazine and 4-amino-imidazo[1,5-f][1,2,4]triazine derivatives of the present
   invention can be prepared by methods well known in the art of organic chemistry. See, for example, J.
20 March, 'Advanced Organic Chemistry' 4th Edition, John Wiley and Sons. During synthetic sequences it
   may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules
   concerned. This is achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in
   T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wutts 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis'             3 d Edition, John Wiley and
   Sons, 1999. The protective groups are optionally removed at a convenient subsequent stage using
25 methods well known in the art.
   The products of the reactions are optionally isolated and purified, if desired, using conventional
   techniques, but not limited to, filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography and the like. Such
   materials are optionally characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and
   spectral data.

   Reduction of 3-chloropyrazine-2-carbonitrile (11)can be accomplished by hydrogenation in the presence of
   a suitable catalysts system and solvent, for example Raney-Nickel to provide (3-chloropyrazin-2
   yl)methanamine (111). This can then be reacted with an appropriately amine protected amino acid. The
 5 reaction of Cbz-N(R 2)CR 3R4)COOH can be carried out in a solvent such as DMF, THF or DCM in the
   presence of a base such as DIPEA, N-methylmorpholine, 4-DMAP or triethylamine and in the presence of
   a coupling reagent such as PyBOP, TBTU, EDCI or HATU to form N-((3-chloropyrazin-2-yl)methyl)amide
   IV.    Cyclisation         chloropyrazine                IV          can          be      performed             using         condensation                reagents     like
   phosphorousoxychloride                    under     heating              conditions to                provide       the 8-chloroimidazo[1,5-a]pyrazine
10 derivatives V. Subsequent bromination can be accomplished using bromine or N-bromosuccinimide in a
   suitable solvent like DCM or DMF at appropriate temperature to obtain compounds of formula VI. 8
   Aminoimidazo[1,5-a]pyrazine derivatives (VII) can be prepared from compounds VI using ammonia(gas)
   in isopropanol at elevated temperature in a pressure vessel (>4 atm). Compounds of formula IX can be
   prepared from compounds of formula Vil using an appropriate boronic acid or pinacol ester (Vill), in the
15 presence          of       a         suitable         palladium                    catalyst           system           and             solvent,           for      example
   bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene                                                 palladium(II)chloride                                    complex                         or
   tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(O) in the presence of potassium carbonate in dioxane/water provide
   compounds of formula IX. Finally, cleaving the protective group of compounds with the formula IX give
   the unprotected amine which after functionalisation, using methods well known in the art, with appropriate
20 warheads with previously defined meanings, provided compounds of formula 1. An example of such
   protective strategy is the use of the benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group to protect the amine from the
   amino acids used, and after deprotection with 33% HBr/HOAc or conc. HCI gave the resulting amines.
   The amino acids HN(R 2)CR 3R4)COOH are either commercially available or they can be readily prepared
   using methods well known to the skilled organic chemist, to introduce protecting groups like
25 benzyloxycarbonyl or tert-butyloxycarbonyl.

   Starting material 3-amino-6-(aminomethyl)-1,2,4-triazin-5(4H)-one X can be prepared via a condensation
10 reaction       of ethyl            bromopyruvate,                dibenzylamine, and                         aminoguanidine                   carbonate,             followed  by
   debenzylation via hydrogenation over Pd-C catalyst [Mitchel, W.L.et al, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 21 (1984)
   pp697].This can then be reacted with an appropriately amine protected amino acid. The reaction of Cbz
   N(R2)CR 3R4)COOH can be carried out in a solvent such as DMF, THF or DCM in the presence of a base
   such as DIPEA, N-methylmorpholine, 4-DMAP or triethylamine and in the presence of a coupling reagent
15 such as         PyBOP, TBTU,                     EDCI         or HATU                to form            N-((3-amino-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-triazin-6
   yl)methyl)amide XI. Cyclisation of the amino-triazinone XI can be performed using condensation reagents
   like phosphorousoxychloride under heating conditions to provide the 2-aminoimidazo[1,5-f][1,2,4]triazin
   4(3H)-one derivatives XII. Subsequent iodination can be accomplished using iodine or N-iodosuccinimide
   in a suitable solvent like DCM or DMF at appropriate temperature to obtain compounds of formula XIll.
20 Removal of the 2-amino group in the 2-aminoimidazo[1,5-f][1,2,4]triazin-4(3H)-one derivatives XIll can be
   perfomed using t-butyl nitrite in solvents like DMF/THF at room temperature to form imidazo[1,5
   f][1,2,4]triazin-4(3H)-one derivatives XIV. 4-Amino-imidazo[1,5-f][1,2,4]triazine derivatives (XV) can be
   prepared from compounds XIV using phosphorousoxychloride, 1,2,4-triazole in pyridine and subsequent
   ammonolysis with ammonia(gas) in isopropanol at room temperature. Compounds of formula XVI can be
25 prepared from compounds of formula XV using an appropriate boronic acid or pinacol ester (Vill), in the
   presence          of         a         suitable            palladium                 catalyst           system                and          solvent,              for     example

   tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(O) in the presence of potassium carbonate in dioxane/water provide
   compounds of formula XVI. Finally, cleaving the protective group of compounds with the formula XVI give
   the unprotected amine which after functionalisation, using methods well known in the art, with appropriate
   warheads with previously defined meanings, provided compounds of formula 1. An example of such
 5 protective strategy is the use of the benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group to protect the amine from the
   amino acids used, and after deprotection with 33% HBr/HOAc or conc. HCI gave the resulting amines.
   The amino acids HN(R 2)CR 3R4)COOH are either commercially available or they can be readily prepared
   using methods well known to the skilled organic chemist, to introduce protecting groups like
   benzyloxycarbonyl or tert-butyloxycarbonyl.
10 Palladium catalysts and conditions to form either the pinacol esters or to couple the boronic acids or
   pinacol esters with the 5-iodoimidazo[1,5-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-amine are well known to the skilled organic
   chemist - see, for example, Ei-ichi Negishi (Editor), Armin de Meijere (Associate Editor), Handbook of
   Organopalladium Chemistry for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 2002.
15 The present invention also includes within its scope all stereoisomeric forms of the 8-amino-imidazo[1,5
   a]pyrazine and 4-amino-imidazo[1,5-f][1,2,4]triazine derivatives according to the present invention
   resulting, for example, because of configurational or geometrical isomerism. Such stereoisomeric forms
   are enantiomers, diastereoisomers, cis and trans isomers etc. For example where azepane-2-carboxylic
   acid is used as amino acid, there exists a mixture of two enantiomers. In the case of the individual
20 stereoisomers of compounds of formula I or salts or solvates thereof, the present invention includes the
   aforementioned stereoisomers substantially free, i.e., associated with less than 5%, preferably less than
   2% and in particular less than 1% of the other stereoisomer. Mixtures of stereoisomers in any proportion,
   for example a racemic mixture comprising substantially equal amounts of two enantiomers are also
   included within the scope of the present invention.
25 For chiral compounds, methods for asymmetric synthesis whereby the pure stereoisomers are obtained
   are well known in the art, e.g. synthesis with chiral induction, synthesis starting from chiral intermediates,
   enantioselective enzymatic conversions, separation of stereoisomers using chromatography on chiral
   media. Such methods are described in Chirality In Industry (edited by A.N. Collins, G.N. Sheldrake and J.
   Crosby, 1992; John Wiley). Likewise methods for synthesis of geometrical isomers are also well known in
30 the art.
   The8-amino-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazine and 4-amino-imidazo[1,5-f][1,2,4]triazine derivatives of the present
   invention, which can be in the form of a free base, may be isolated from the reaction mixture in the form
   of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also be obtained by
   treating the free base of formula I with an organic or inorganic acid such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen
35 bromide, hydrogen iodide, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, maleic
   acid, malonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic
   acid, and ascorbic acid.

                                                        28
   The8-amino-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazine and 4-amino-imidazo[1,5-f][1,2,4]triazine derivatives of the present
   invention also exist as amorphous forms. Multiple crystalline forms are also possible. All the physical
   forms are included within the scope of the present invention.
   Preparation of solvates is generally known. Thus, for example, M. Caira et al, J. Pharmaceutical Sci.,
 5 93(3), 601-611 (2004) describe the preparation of the solvates of the antifungal fluconazole in ethyl
   acetate as well as from water. Similar preparations of solvates, hemisolvate, hydrates and the like are
   described by E. C. van Tonder et al, AAPS PharmSciTech., 5(1), article 12 (2004); and A. L. Bingham et
   al, Chem. Commun. 603-604 (2001). A typical, non-limiting, process involves dissolving the inventive
   compound in desired amounts of the desired solvent (organic or water or mixtures thereof) at a higher
10 than ambient temperature, and cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals which are then
   isolated by standard methods. Analytical techniques such as, for example IR spectroscopy, show the
   presence of the solvent (or water) in the crystals as a solvate (or hydrate).
   The present invention also embraces isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention which are
   identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having
15 an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature.
   Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of
                                                                                             3
   hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine and chlorine, such as       2H,    H, 13C,   c,1  5
                                                                                                                N, 170,
   18o,    P, 3P,  3S, 1F, and  36C,, respectively.
   Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula I (e.g. those labeled with       3H   and   14C) are useful in
20 compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., 3 H) and carbon-14 (i.e.,    14C)  isotopes
   are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier
                                         2
   isotopes such as deuterium (i.e.,       H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater
   metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be
   preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of Formula I can generally be prepared
25 by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples herinbelow,
   by substituting an appropriate isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotoplically labeled reagent.
   The invention is illustrated by the following examples.

   Btk enzyme activity
 5 Btk enzyme activity is measured using the IMAP (immobilized metal ion affinity-based fluorescence
   polarization) assay as outlined below.
   Btk enzyme (His-Btk (Millipore catalog# 14-552), is diluted to 0.4 U/mL in KR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCI, 10
   mM MgCl 2 , 0.01% Tween-20, 0.05% NaN3 , 1 mM DTT, 2 mM MnCl 2, pH 7.2).
   Serial dilution log10 from 2 mM to 63.2 nM of test compounds are made in 100% DMSO. The dilutions in
10 DMSO are then diluted 50-fold in KR-buffer. Final compound concentration range in the assay from 10
   pM to 0.316 nM.
   5 pL/well of test compound in KR buffer (final DMSO concentration in the assay is 1%) is mixed with 5
   pl/well of 0.4 U/mL Btk enzyme (final concentration in the assay is 0.1 U/mL). Test compounds and Btk
   enzyme are pre-incubated 60 minutes at room temperature, before adding 5 pL/well of 200 nM Fluorescin
15 labeled substrate peptide (Blk/Lyntide substrate, e.g. #R7188/#R7233, Molecular Devices) in KR-buffer.
   Final peptide substrate concentration in assay is 50 nM. The kinase assay is started by adding 5 pL/well
   of 20 pM ATP in KR-buffer (final ATP concentration is 5 pM ATP, Km ATP in Btk IMAP assay). Following
   incubation for 2h at room temperature the enzyme reaction is stopped by adding 40 pL/well IMAP
   Progressive Binding Solution (according to suppliers (Molecular Devices) protocol using 75% 1x buffer A
20 and 25% 1x buffer B with 1:600 Progressive Binding Solution). After 60 min incubation at room
   temperature in the dark the FP signal is read. Fluorescence at 535 nm is measured using parallel and
   perpendicular filters to determine differences in rotation due to binding of the phosphorylated substrate
   peptide to the beads. Values are calculated as percentage of the difference in readout (AmPi) of the
   controls with and without ATP. EC50 values are determined by curve fitting of the experimental results
25 using Activity Base.
   All examples have an EC50 of 10 pM or lower.

   Lyn enzyme activity
   Lyn enzyme activity is measured using the IMAP (immobilized metal ion affinity-based fluorescence
 5 polarization) assay as outlined below.
   Lyn enzyme (Millipore catalog# 14-510), is diluted to 250 mU/mL in KR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCI, 10 mM
   MgCl 2 , 0.01% Tween-20, 0.05% NaN 3 , 1 mM DTT, 2 mM MnCl 2 , pH 7.2).
   Serial dilution log10 from 2 mM to 63.2 nM of test compounds are made in 100% DMSO. The dilutions in
   DMSO are then diluted 50-fold in KR-buffer of which 5 pl is used in the assay, leading to a final
10 compound concentration range in the assay from 10 pM to 0.316 nM.
   5 pL/well of test compound in KR buffer (final DMSO concentration in the assay is 1%) is mixed with 5
   pl/well of 250 mU/mL Lyn enzyme (final concentration in the assay is 62.5 mU/mL). Test compounds and
   Lyn enzyme are pre-incubated 60 minutes at room temperature, before adding 5 pL/well of 400 nM
   Fluorescin labeled substrate peptide (Blk/Lyntide substrate, e.g. #R7188/#R7233, Molecular Devices) in
15 KR-buffer. Final peptide substrate concentration in assay is 100 nM. The kinase assay is started by
   adding 5 pL/well of 8 pM ATP in KR-buffer (final ATP concentration is 2 pM ATP, Km ATP in Lyn IMAP
   assay). Following incubation for 2h at room temperature the enzyme reaction is stopped by adding 40
   pL/well IMAP Progressive Binding Solution (according to suppliers (Molecular Devices) protocol using
   75% 1x buffer A and 25% 1x buffer B with 1:600 Progressive Binding Solution). After 60 min incubation at
20 room temperature in the dark the FP signal is read. Fluorescence at 535 nm is measured using parallel
   and perpendicular filters to determine differences in rotation due to binding of the phosphorylated
   substrate peptide to the beads. Values are calculated as percentage of the difference in readout (AmPi) of
   the controls with and without ATP. EC5 0 values are determined by curve fitting of the experimental results
   using Activity Base.
