This application is a divisional of Australian patent application 2014232714, which is the
national phase entry of PCT international application PCT/US2014/030524 (published as
WO 2014/145715) and claims priority to United States Serial No. 61/792,413, filed March 15,
2013. The entire contents of the aforementioned applications are incorporated herein.
                                         Technical Field
[0001]      This disclosure relates to metabolites of N-(4-{[6,7-bis(methyloxy)quinolin-4
yl]oxy}phenyl)-N'-(4-fluorophenyl)cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxamide,           a c-Met inhibitor.
                                           Background
[0002]      Traditionally, dramatic improvements in the treatment of cancer are associated
with identification of therapeutic agents acting through novel mechanisms. One mechanism
that can be exploited in cancer treatment is the modulation of protein kinase activity because
signal transduction through protein kinase activation is responsible for many of the
characteristics of tumor cells. Protein kinase signal transduction is of particular relevance in,
for example, thyroid, gastric, head and neck, lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, as
well as in the growth and proliferation of brain tumor cells.
[0003]      Protein kinases can be categorized as receptor type or non-receptor type.
Receptor-type tyrosine kinases are comprised of a large number of transmembrane receptors
with diverse biological activity. For a detailed discussion of the receptor-type tyrosine
kinases, see Plowman et al., DN&P 7(6): 334-339, 1994. Since protein kinases and their
ligands play critical roles in various cellular activities, deregulation of protein kinase
enzymatic activity can lead to altered cellular properties, such as uncontrolled cell growth
associated with cancer. In addition to oncological indications, altered kinase signaling is
implicated in numerous other pathological diseases, including, for example, immunological
disorders, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory diseases, and degenerative diseases.
Therefore, protein kinases are attractive targets for small molecule drug discovery.
Particularly attractive targets for small-molecule modulation with respect to antiangiogenic
and antiproliferative activity include receptor type tyrosine kinases Ret, c-Met, and VEGFR2.
                                                  1

[0004]      The kinase c-Met is the prototypic member of a subfamily of heterodimeric
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) which include Met, Ron, and Sea. The endogenous ligand
for c-Met is the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a potent inducer of angiogenesis. Binding
of HGF to c-Met induces activation of the receptor via autophosphorylation resulting in an
increase of receptor dependent signaling, which promotes cell growth and invasion. Anti
HGF antibodies or HGF antagonists have been shown to inhibit tumor metastasis in vivo (Se
Maulik et al, Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews, 2002, 13, 41-59). c-Met, VEGFR2, and/or
Ret overexpression has been demonstrated on a wide variety of tumor types, including breast,
colon, renal, lung, squamous cell myeloid leukemia, hemangiomas, melanomas, and
astrocytic tumor (which includes glioblastoma, giant cell glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, and
glioblastoma with oligodendroglial components). The Ret protein is a transmembrane
receptor with tyrosine kinase activity. Ret is mutated in most familial forms of medullary
thyroid cancer. These mutations activate the kinase function of Ret and convert it into an
oncogenic form.
[0005]      Accordingly, small-molecule compounds that specifically inhibit, regulate, and/or
modulate the signal transduction of kinases, particularly including Ret, c-Met, and VEGFR2
described above, are particularly desirable as a means to treat or prevent disease states
associated with abnormal cell proliferation and angiogenesis.      One such small-molecule is
XL184, known variously as N-(4-{[6,7-bis(methyloxy)quinolin-4-yl]oxy}phenyl)-N'-(4
fluorophenyl)cyclopropane- 1,1 -dicarboxamide and by the name cabozantinib
(COMETRIQ TM), which is the L-malate salt of cabozantinib. Cabozantinib has the chemical
structure:
                                           O                        F
                                O       N
In November, 2012, cabozantinib achieved regulatory approval in the United States for the
treatment of progressive metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. Other clinical trials of
cabozantinib are ongoing.
[0006]      WO 2005/030140 describes the synthesis of cabozantinib (Example 48) and also
discloses the therapeutic activity of this molecule to inhibit, regulate, and/or modulate the
signal transduction of kinases, (Assays, Table 4, entry 289). Example 48 is on paragraph
[0353] in WO 2005/030140.
                                                2

[0007]     A need remains for identifying compounds that exhibit a similar activity profile to
cabozantinib.

external documents, or other sources of information, this is generally for the purpose of
providing a context for discussing the features of the invention. Unless specifically stated
otherwise, reference to such external documents is not to be construed as an admission that

                               Detailed Description of the Invention
[0018g]       The term "comprising" as used in this specification and claims means "consisting
at least in part of'. When interpreting statements in this specification and claims which
include the term "comprising", other features besides the features prefaced by this term in
each statement can also be present. Related terms such as "comprise", "comprises", and
"comprised" are to be interpreted in similar manner.
[0019]       In one aspect, the invention is directed to metabolites of cabozantinib, particularly
human metabolites. Thus, the metabolites may be referred to hereinafter as "human
metabolites." Human metabolites of cabozantinib include metabolites of cabozantinib that
were formed in the bodies of human subjects after ingestion or application of cabozantinib
according to clinical protocols regarding dosing and monitoring, including those described
herein. In various embodiments, the term encompasses molecular species formed in vivo,
whether or not the species is even detected or analyzed in a particular trial. It is also
contemplated that some metabolites are unique to particular individuals, reflecting different
genetic make-up and the presence and activity of various enzymes, including cytochrome
P450 and UGT enzymes which are involved in metabolism. Thus, human metabolites cover
all such metabolites formed in the human body.
[0020]       Some human metabolites are depicted in Scheme 1. These human metabolites
were identified during clinical studies of cabozantinib, which appears as compound I in
Scheme 1, by metabolic profiling, particularly from human plasma, urine, and feces.

[0021]             In various embodiments, the cabozantinib metabolites, including those depicted in
Scheme 1, are isolated from body tissues and fluids, and/or are prepared synthetically
according to methods available to the skilled artisan. A variety of separation processes can
be carried out on tissue and fluid samples to provide samples for further analysis, such as
nuclear magnetic resonance, gas chromatography (GC), liquid chromatography (LC), and
mass spectrometry. In such samples, the metabolites are contained in compositions that are
essentially lacking in the presence of any of the other metabolites. The presence of the
metabolites can be quantified by physical methods, such as the measurement of nuclear decay
from radioactive isotopes, measurement of index of refraction, flame ionization, ionization
and deflection in magnetic fields, ultraviolet (UV absorption), and the like.
                                                                              10

[0022]      In various embodiments, the human metabolites are provided in crystalline or
solution forms that have considerable degrees of purity. Organic synthetic routes are
available for preparing the compounds in relative pure form, for example, in purities of 80
percent or greater, 90 percent or greater, 95 percent or greater, or 99 percent or greater.
Recrystallization and other purification methods can be carried out to provide compounds
that are essentially 100 percent pure. Such synthetic methods and purification techniques are
known in the art.
[0023]      In various embodiments, the metabolites are provided in substantially pure form.
"Substantially pure" means that metabolites are pure enough for FDA approval and contain
essentially no contaminants or other materials. Alternatively, "substantially pure" means a
level of impurity that does not adversely or unacceptably affect the properties of the
compounds with respect to safety, effectiveness, stability, and other desirable properties.

Scheme 1. In this and other embodiments, the metabolite is selected from:

[0034]        Methods of the invention include administering cabozantinib or a cabozantinib
metabolite to a mammal such as a human and detecting metabolites by measuring the level of
concentration of one of the metabolites in in the tissues or bodily fluids of the mammal.
Bodily fluids include, without limitation, blood plasma, bile, urine, and feces, while tissues
include, without limitation, liver microsomes, hepatocytes, and perfused livers. In various
embodiments, the metabolites are isotopically labeled with various isotopes to assist in
detection or quantification of the metabolites in in the tissues or bodily fluids. Thus, the
metabolites include those that are labeled with      14 C or 3H (tritium) for the purpose of detecting
or identifying particular metabolites from their nuclear decay products. The metabolites also
                                     13
include metabolites labeled with        C or 2 H (deuterium) to facilitate nuclear magnetic
resonance and/or mass spectrometric analysis of the compounds. As used herein, deuterated
means substituted with deuterium, and tritiated means substituted with tritium. In various
other embodiments, the metabolites of the invention, as depicted in Scheme 1, also include
their salts, tautomers, and isotopically labeled variants (including      14 C, 13 C, 3H, or 2 H).

[0080]      Alternatively, or additionally, the metabolites are administered to subjects or test
animals not having any of the above mentioned disease states for the purpose of studying
                                                24

non-pharmacological effects, such as side effects, toxicity, metabolism, uptake,
bioavailability, and routes of excretion.
[00811        In various embodiments, the metabolites are administered by any suitable route
including oral, rectal, intranasal, intrapulmonary (e.g., by inhalation), or parenteral (e.g.
intradermal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous) routes. Oral
administration is preferred in some embodiments, and the dosage can be given with or
without food, i.e. in the fasting or non-fasting state. Non-limiting examples of dosage forms
include uncoated or coated tablets, capsules, powders, granules, suppositories, solutions,
ointments, creams, and sprays.
[0082]       Formulations of the invention suitable for oral administration are prepared as
discrete units, such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount
of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as solution or a suspension in an aqueous
liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion; or a water-in-oil liquid
emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary, or paste.
[0083]       A tablet is made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more
accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable
machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form, such as a powder or granules, optionally
mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active, or dispersing agent.
Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered
active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated
or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the
active ingredient therefrom. In one embodiment, acid hydrolysis of the medicament is
obviated by use of an enteric coating.
[0084]       An enteric coating is a means of protecting a compound of the invention in order
to avoid exposing a portion of the gastrointestinal tract, typically the upper gastrointestinal
tract, in particular the stomach and esophagus, to the compound of this invention. In this way,
gastric mucosal tissue is protected against rates of exposure to a compound of the invention
which produce adverse effects such as nausea; and, alternatively, a compound of the
invention is protected from conditions present in one or more portions of the gastrointestinal
tract, typically the upper gastrointestinal tract.
[0085]       Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges
comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth;
pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin or
                                                  25

sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid
carrier.
[0086]      Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a
suitable base comprising, for example, cocoa butter or a salicylate.
[0087]      While it is possible for the active ingredients to be administered alone, it may be
preferable to present them as pharmaceutical formulations. The formulations, both for
veterinary and for human use, comprise at least one active ingredient, as defined above,
together with one or more acceptable carriers and optionally comprising other therapeutic
ingredients. The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in that they are compatible with the other
ingredients of the formulation and physiologically innocuous to the recipient thereof.
[0088]      In various embodiments the compounds are formulated in a carrier system. Such
systems are known and include binders, fillers, preservatives, disintegrants, flow regulators,
plasticizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, dispersants, lubricants, solvents, release slowing
agents (including enteric coatings), antioxidants, and propellant gases. Especially when
formulated for administration to humans, the active agents are preferably combined with at
least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such carriers are known and include, without
limitation, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycol, and N-vinylpyrrolidone polymers. The
administration forms comprise a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds, which
make up from 0.1% to about 90% by weight of the dosage form.
[0089]      The compounds of this invention are formulated with conventional carriers and
excipients, which are selected in accord with ordinary practice. Tablets will contain
excipients, glidants, fillers, binders, and the like. Aqueous formulations are prepared in
sterile form and, when intended for delivery by other than oral administration, generally will
be isotonic. All formulations will optionally contain excipients, such as those set forth in the
"Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients" (1986). Excipients include ascorbic acid and other
antioxidants, chelating agents such as EDTA, carbohydrates such as dextrin,
hydroxyalkylcellulose, hydroxyalkylmethylcellulose, stearic acid, and the like.
[0090]      The formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration routes.
The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by
any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations
generally are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co., Easton,
Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with
the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations
are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with
                                                  26

liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the
product.

[0092]        The compounds disclosed herein can be made according to methods available to
the skilled practitioner. For example, as depicted in Scheme 2, peptide chemistry can be used
to make the phenols C-1 and C-2 from the corresponding amines and carboxylic acids. A
variety of processes and reagents are available for achieving such transformations and are
described, for instance, in Tetrahedron 61 (2005) 10827-10852. A representative example is
depicted in Scheme 2, wherein the activating agent is thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride, or the
like. The corresponding acid chloride reacts with compound A or B, respectively, to provide
phenol C-1 or C-2. Subsequent reaction of phenol C-1 or C-2 with a sulfating agent, such as
chlorosulfonic acid or sulfur trioxide-trimethylamine complex, in the presence of a base, such
as triethylamine, alkali metal hydroxide or the like, can provide the corresponding hydrogen
sulfate 2b or 2a, respectively.

oral dose of 175 mg of cabozantinib (L-malate salt) containing [ 14 C]-cabozantinib (100 [Ci).
The plasma, urine, and fecal samples were collected from the 8 subjects for the metabolite
profiling.
Plasma samples were collected at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 14, 24, 72, 168, 336, 504 and
648 hours post-dose; urine samples were collected at pre-dose, 0-8 hours, 8-24 hours, at 24
hour intervals to 480 hours post-dose, and at greater than 48-hour intervals from 504 to 1152
hours post-dose; and feces samples were collected at pre-dose, at 24-hour intervals to 480
hours post-dose, and at greater than 48-hour intervals from 504 to 1152 hours post-dose. All
samples were shipped to QPS LLC (Newark, DE) and stored at -70 'C. HPLC/tandem MS
coupled with a radio flow-through detector (RFD) was used for metabolite profiling and
identification for samples with sufficient levels of radioactivity.
[00102]      HPLC fraction collection followed by counting with TopCount NXT TM was used
for radioquantitation of plasma samples with sufficient levels of radioactivity. Three (3)
HPLC methods were used in this study to separate cabozantinib and its metabolites. HPLC
Method 1 was used for the analysis of pooled urine and fecal samples and individual plasma
samples from different time points. HPLC Method 2 was used for the analysis of plasma
samples from a drug-drug interaction study to search for possible metabolites that may co
elute with cabozantinib sulfate. HPLC Method 3 was used for pooled plasma samples.
[00103]      Selected samples for plasma, urine, and feces from 6 subjects were analyzed for
cabozantinib and metabolites and reported.
[00104]      Samples from 2 subjects were used for the investigation study.
        Test Article
[00105]      The test article for this study was a mixture of [ 14 C] cabozantinib and cabozantinib.
The asterisk indicates the position of the [ 14 C] label. [ 14 C] labeled cabozantinib was prepared
as provided in WO 2005/030140, except that [ 14 C] labeled 4-amino phenol was used instead

[00106]      Formic acid and ammonium acetate were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical
Co. (St. Louis, MO). Acetonitrile (B & J brand, carbonyl free, for applications sensitive to
trace aldehyde and ketone), water (B & J brand, for GC, HPLC and spectrophotometry), and
methanol (HPLC grade) were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Type I
water was generated using an Elgastat UHQ PS water purification system. Non-radiolabeled
metabolite standards (fluoroaniline cleavage product, cabozantinib sulfate, and cabozantinib
N-oxide) were provided by Exelixis, Inc.
         Biological Sample Collection
[00107]      The plasma, urine, and fecal samples were collected from a mass balance study of
cabozantinib following a single 175 mg oral administration of cabozantinib (L-malate salt)
containing [ 14 C] cabozantinib (100 PCi) in healthy male subjects. Samples were shipped
from Celerion (Lincoln, NE) to QPS LLC (Newark, DE) on dry ice and were stored at -70'C
until analysis. Samples from 6 subjects were used for metabolite profiling, identification, and
radio-quantitation. Plasma samples from 2 subjects were only used in a bridging study as
part of investigation of co-eluting metabolites.
         Sample Preparation and Radioactive Recovery for Human Plasma
[00108]      For metabolite profiling, identification, and radio-quantitation, individual
radiolabeled plasma samples collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 14, 24, 72, 168, and 336 hours
post-dose were processed and analyzed for 6 subjects. For the investigation of co-eluting
metabolites, nonradiolabeled plasma samples of six subjects were pooled, processed, and
analyzed for pre-dose, 1-7, 8-96, and 120-336 hours post-dose. To bridge the metabolite data
from non-radiolabeled to radiolabeled plasma samples from the human mass balance study,
[14 C] plasma samples from 0-168 hours post-dose for each of the six subjects were also
pooled using the Hamilton pooling method, processed, and analyzed by radio-quantitation.
                                                 33

[ 14C] Plasma samples from 1-168 hours post-dose for two subjects were pooled (equal
volume), processed, and analyzed.
         Initial Method for Plasma Extraction and Recovery
[00109]      Two plasma samples from a subject (4 and 72 hours post-dose) were used for
initial extraction and recovery determination. The total radioactivity for each plasma sample
in mass balance study was provided by Exelixis, Inc., and was defined as 100%. After the
samples were thawed under a biological hood, two 0.5 mL aliquots of each plasma sample
were added to 3 volumes (1.5 mL) of MeOH:ACN (20:80, v/v) and vortexed (5 min). The
mixtures were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the supernatants were transferred
to clean tubes. The pellets were extracted with two additional 3 volumes of MeOH:CAN
(20:80, v/v). The mixtures were centrifuged, and the supematants were combined. Aliquots
were analyzed by a 2900 TR liquid scintillation counter (LSC) (Packard Instruments,
Meridian, CT). The extraction recovery was calculated as the following:
        Extraction Recovery (%)    = (DPM in supematant/DPM in plasma sample) x 100
[00110]      The supernatants from the extraction were evaporated to dryness under a stream of
nitrogen in an ambient water bath. The residues were then reconstituted in 0.35 - 0.5 mL of
MeOH:ACN:water (10:20:70, v/v/v). The reconstituted samples were centrifuged at 15,000
rpm for 10 minutes and aliquots were analyzed by LSC for reconstitution recovery.
    Reconstitution Recovery (%)= (DPM in reconstitution solution /DPM in supernatant) x
                                               100
         Plasma Sample Preparation
[00111]      Radiolabeled and non-radiolabeled plasma samples were extracted employing the
same method, using 1.0-2 mL plasma samples, depending on the volume available and
radioactivity level of the samples. The supernatants were evaporated to dryness under a
stream of nitrogen in an ambient water bath, and the residues were reconstituted in 0.35-0.5
mL of MeOH:ACN:water (10:20:70, v/v/v). The reconstituted samples were centrifuged at
15,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Aliquots of the supernatants were injected onto the HPLC
system for analysis.
                                               34

        Sample Preparation and Radioactive Recovery for Human Urine
[00112]     Pooled urine samples from a subject (0-72, 168-192, and 312-336 hours post dose)
were lyophilized in triplicate (each 4 mL), and the residues were reconstituted in 1 mL of
water:ACN:FA (80:20:0.1, v/v/v). The radioactivity in pooled urine and reconstituted
solution was counted using LSC, and the reconstitution recovery calculated. For metabolite
profiling, identification, and radio-quantitation, pre-dose and 3 pooled urine samples (0-72
hours, 168-192 hours, and 312-336 hours post-dose) from each of the six subjects were
analyzed. Each pooled urine sample was lyophilized, the residue was reconstituted in
water:ACN:FA (80:20:0.1, v/v/v), and the reconstituted sample was centrifuged at 15,000
rpm for 10 min before analysis.
        Sample Preparation and Radioactive Recovery for Human Urine
[00113]     To evaluate the extraction recovery of fecal samples, two fecal homogenate
samples from a subject were thawed under a biological hood. Approximately 5.5-6 g fecal
homogenate was accurately weighed out for the extraction. Fifteen mL ACN:MeOH (80:20)
was added to the fecal homogenates. The mixtures were vortexed for 3 minutes and
centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatants were transferred to clean tubes.
The extraction procedure was repeated two more times. The supernatants from all three
extractions were combined. The radioactivity in the combined supernatants was determined
by LSC. The extraction recovery was calculated using the following formula:
     Extraction Recovery (%)       =  (DPM in supernatant/DPM in fecal homogenate) x 100
[00114]     The supernatant was concentrated under a nitrogen stream at ambient temperature,
and the residues were reconstituted in MeOH:ACN:water (10:20:70). Aliquots of
reconstitution solution were counted with LSC for reconstitution recovery.
 Reconstitution Recovery (%)      =  (DPM in reconstitution solution/DPM in supernatant) x 100
    Overall Recovery (%)      = Extraction Recovery (%) x Reconstitution Recovery (%)/100
[00115]     For metabolite profiling, identification, and radio-quantitation, pre-dose and 3
pooled fecal samples (0-72, 168-192, and 312-336 hours post-dose) from each of the six
subjects were extracted using the same procedures for extraction recovery. The supernatants
were dried under a nitrogen stream, and the residues were reconstituted in water:ACN:FA
                                                 35

(80:20:0.1, v/v/v). The reconstituted samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min
before analysis.
        HPLC Column Recovery
[001161     HPLC column recovery was carried out to demonstrate that all radioactive
components were effectively eluted from the column using HPLC Method 1. Aliquots of
urine samples (Subject 1042, 24-48 hours post-dose) were injected onto the HPLC system
with or without a column, and the eluents from 0-30 minutes were collected into clean 50 mL
centrifuge tubes. The weights of fluent from each injection were obtained after collection,
and duplicate aliquots (1 mL) were counted using LSC. The average value of the counts was
used to calculate the total radioactivity contained in the collected eluent with or without a
column installed.
  Column Recovery (%)= (DPM in eluent with column/DPM in eluent without column) x
                                                100
[00117]     HPLC Method 3 was used for pooled plasma only, and the column recovery was
not performed due to limited sample volume available.
        HPLC/MS/RFD and HPLC Radio-Analysis Systems
[001181     The system for metabolite profiling and identification (HPLC/MS/RFD) consisted
of a HTC PAL autosampler, a Surveyor HPLC pump, a LTQ linear ion trap mass
spectrometer, and a  p-RAM Model      3 RFD. The data obtained by mass spectrometry and
RFD were processed by Xcalibur and Laura Lite 3 software, respectively. The HPLC eluent
was split between the RFD and mass spectrometer with a ratio of 3 to 1. The following are
the summary of the conditions for HPLC, mass spectrometer, and RFD.

[00119]     The HPLC-MS system for high resolution MS consisted of a Michrom
Bioresources Paradigm MS4B HPLC and a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap Discovery mass
spectrometer. Chromatographic conditions and the ion source parameters were the same as
HPLC method 1 for the LTQ system. Data were acquired with a resolution of 30000 in
centroid mode.
[00120]     An HPLC/TopCount NXT TM system was used for the radio-quantitation of plasma
samples. The system consisted of an HTC PAL autosampler, two Shimadzu HPLC pumps,
                                              38

and a Foxy Jr. Fraction Collector (Isco, Lincoln, NE). HPLC fractions collected in a
LumaPlateTM 96-well plate were dried using an EZ-2pius Personal Evaporator (Genevac,
Valley Cottage, New York), and the dried samples were counted by TopCount NXTTM
Microplate Scintillation & Luminescence Counter (PerkinElmer*). The data were processed
using ProFSA (PerkinElmer*) software. The HPLC methods were the same as described
above.
        Metabolite Identification
[00121]     Metabolites that represented greater than 5% of the total radioactivity or 5% of
total AUC in the matrix were identified according to the following process. Mass spectra
(MS, MS/MS, and MS/MS/MS) of cabozantinib and its metabolite standards, provided by the
Exelixis, Inc., were acquired on an ion trap mass spectrometer. Major fragment patterns were
proposed. Identification of these metabolites was confirmed by matching mass spectra (MS
and MS/MS) and retention times with authentic reference standards. For other unknown
metabolites, molecular ions were searched on LC/MS chromatograms operating in full scan
positive as well as negative ionization modes at the same retention times as those found on
LC-radio chromatogram. Product ion mass spectra and high resolution mass spectra were
then acquired for the corresponding molecular ions. Putative metabolite structures were
proposed based on the analysis of their mass fragment patterns.
        Quantitation of cabozantinib and its Metabolites
[00122]     Quantitation of cabozantinib and its metabolites in pooled or individual samples
from each matrix at different time points or time intervals was based on integration of the
corresponding peaks found on their radio-chromatograms. For plasma samples, percent of
total radioactivity in the sample for each peak at each time point was calculated and
converted to ng/mL.
[00123]     For quantification of cabozantinib and its metabolites in plasma:
    ng/mL = (% of the total radioactivity) x (total ng equivalent/mL for the time point)/100
[00124]     The values of total ng equivalent/mL were obtained from the results of the human
mass balance study.
[00125]     For the pooled urine samples, percent of total radioactivity in the pooled sample
for each peak was calculated as the % of total non-parent in the pooled samples:
      % of total non-parent in the pooled samples     = (total radioactivity of the peak/total
                                               39

                                 radioactivity of the non-parent peaks) x 100
[00126]         For the pooled fecal samples, percent of total radioactivity in the pooled sample
for each peak was calculated as the percent of total non-parent plus parent in the pooled
samples:
    % of total non-parent plus parent in the pooled samples                    = (total radioactivity of the
                   peak/total radioactivity of the parent and non-parent peaks) x 100
[00127]         The percent of total radioactivity in the pooled sample for each peak was
converted to the percent of parent in the pooled samples:
  % of parent in the pooled samples                 = (total radioactivity of the peak/total radioactivity of
                                                 the parent peak) x 100
[00128]         The limit of quantification for a radioactivity detector was defined as the ratio of
signal to noise (3 to 1) on the radio-chromatogram. The low limits of quantification were 10
and 500 dpm for the TopCount and p-RAM radio flow-through detector, respectively.
Results and Discussion
         Radioactive Recovery
[00129]         The initial extraction recovery was determined using plasma samples from a
subject at 4 hours and 72 hours post-dose with three volumes of MeOH:ACN (20:80)
extracting three times. The mean extraction recoveries of radioactivity from 4 and 72 hour
samples were 98.43% and 94.99%, respectively. After drying down and reconstitution into
MeOH:ACN solution, the reconstitution recoveries were 92.73% and 85.90%, respectively.
The overall recoveries were 91.27% and 81.60%, respectively.
[00130]         Urine centrifugation recoveries determined using 0-8, 24-48, 72-96, and 120-144
hour post-dose samples from the subject ranged between 102% and 104%. Urine
reconstitution recovery after lyophilization was 94.7% using pooled samples from a subject.
[00131]         For pooled fecal samples from 0-48 hours post dose, the extraction, reconstitution,
and overall recoveries were 98.48%, 88.80%, and 87.37%, respectively. For pooled fecal
samples of 120-168 hours post dose, the extraction, reconstitution, and overall recoveries
were  8 5 . 8 5 %, 8 7 . 6 9 %, and 7 5 . 2 4 %,  respectively.

[00132]     The radioactivity recovery from HPLC column for urine sample was 97.05%.
[00133]     No correction factor was applied to the plasma, urine, and fecal radio-quantitation
to account for the recovery.
        Metabolite Profiling
[00134]     In a subject, cabozantinib, compound 9 (cabozantinib sulfate), and compound 19
(cabozantinib N-oxide) were the major peaks on the radio-chromatograms. Compound 2
(demethylated and sulfated fluoroaniline cleavage product) was the major metabolite in
plasma samples after 72 hours post-dose. Metabolite compound 7 (fluoroaniline cleavage
product) accounted for one of the minor peaks. Metabolite compounds 7, 3 (demethyl
cabozantinib glucuronide B), 9, and 10 (methyl ester of fluoroaniline cleavage product) co
eluted using HPLC Method 1.
[00135]     Representative human urine metabolite profiles, the radio-chromatograms (using
HPLC Method 1) of human urine samples from 0-72 hours, 144-192 hours, and 288-336
hours post-dose were collected from a subject. Metabolite compound 6 was the major
metabolite in 0-72 hours, 144-192 hours, and 288-336 hours post dose pooled urine samples.
In addition to compound 6, metabolite compounds 1, 4, 5, 7, and 19 were observed in the
pooled sample of 0-72 hours post dose. Metabolite compounds 1, 4, 5, and 7 were observed
in the pooled sample of 144-192 hours post dose. Metabolite compounds 1 and 5 were
detected in the pooled sample of 288-336 hours post dose. Parent compound cabozantinib
was not observed in urine samples.
[00136]     Representative human fecal metabolite profiles, the radio-chromatograms (using
HPLC Method 1) of human fecal samples from 0-72 hours, 144-192 hours, and 288-336
hours post-dose from a. Parent cabozantinib and metabolites compound 4, 7, 11, and 15
(including compound 16) were observed in the pooled sample of 0-72 hours post dose.
Metabolite compounds 4, 7, 11, 15, 16, and 18 were observed in the pooled sample of 144
192 hours post dose. Metabolite compounds 4 and 11 were observed in the pooled sample of
288-336 hours post dose.
        Metabolite Identification Using HPLC/MS Analysis
[00137]     HPLC/MS analysis of authentic standards using HPLC Method 1 showed that the
retention times of cabozantinib, fluoroaniline cleavage product (compound 7), sulfate
(compound 9), and N-oxide (compound 19) were 20.3, 14.4, 16.5, and 23.1 minutes,
respectively.
                                               41

[00138]    Plasma, urine, and fecal samples were next analyzed by HOPLC/MS, and the
compounds were identified based on their protonated molecular ions and fragmentation
patterns.
        Metabolite Identification of Cabozantinib and its Metabolites in Human Plasma
[00139]    The mass spectrum of the peak at approximately 19.1 minutes in the XIC showed
the protonated molecular ions at m/z 502. Its product ion spectra showed major fragments at
m/z 391, 323, and 297, which is consistent with those of cabozantinib standard. The MS data
is summarized in Table 1 and 2.

Kinase Profiler Service Assay Protocols Protocol Guide Volume 57. The results are
summarized below in Table 3. Inhibition is indicated as IC 5 o with the following key: A          =
IC 5o less than 50 nM, B  = IC 5o greater than 50 nM, but less than 500 nM, C      =  IC 5o greater
than 500 nM, but less than 5000 nM, and D       = IC 5 o greater than 5,000 nM. Depending upon
the functionality about the quinazoline or quinoline, exemplary compounds of the invention
exhibit selectivity for any of c-Met, KDR, c-Kit, fit-3, and fit-4. Abbreviations for enzymes
listed in Table 3 are defined as follows: c-Met refers to hepatocyte growth factor receptor
kinase; RET refers to RET proto-oncogene kinase; KDR refers to kinase insert domain
receptor tyrosine kinase; fit-I alpha, fit-3, and fit-4, fms-like tyrosine kinases, representative
                                                  43

of the FLK family of receptor tyrosine kinases; and Aurora B MP refers to Aurora B kinase.
When a percentage is listed instead of an IC 5 o value, it indicates percent inhibition at 1 uM.
Empty cells in the tables indicate lack of data only.

[00155]      To the cyclopropyl di-carboxylic acid (449 mg, 3.45 mmol) in THF (3.5 mL) was
added TEA (485 pL, 3.45 mmol). The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature
under a nitrogen atmosphere for 40 minutes before adding thionyl chloride (250 pL, 3.44
mmol). The reaction was monitored by LCMS for the formation of mono acid chloride
(quenched the sample with MeOH and looked for corresponding mono methyl ester). After 3
hours stirring at room temperature, 4-(6,7-dimethoxy-quinolin-4-yloxy)-phenylamine (1.02 g,
