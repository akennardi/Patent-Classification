A LOCK ASSEMBLY
 FIELD
 [0001] The present invention relates to lock assemblies, and more particularly but not
exclusively to lock assemblies employed in hinged and sliding doors and windows.
 BACKGROUND
 [0002] There are a variety of lock cylinders employed in locks. The lock cylinders include an
outer housing that rotatably receives a barrel. Attached to the end extremity of the barrel is a
cam member, that is moved angularly by operation of a key inserted in the barrel. The cam
engages various items within the lock to cause operation of the lock.
 [0003] In some instances the cam is fixed to the barrel so that there can be no relative movement
therebetween. That is, whenever the barrel moves the cam moves with it. In other instances the
cam is attached to the barrel to provide lost motion. For example, the barrel may be rotated in
one direction to operate the lock, and then in the reverse direction to return to a position at which
the key can be removed. However, the cam is maintained in the position to which it was moved.
Accordingly, there needs to be lost motion between the cam and barrel to allow the key to be
moved to a position at which it can be removed. The barrel is limited in respect of the angle it
can move relative to the cylinder housing.
 [0004] Lock assemblies for sliding doors and windows include a locking bar (slide) that is
moved between a retaining position and a release position in respect of the lock tongue. In some
jurisdictions, preference is given to lock cylinders that have the cam fixed to the barrel. In other
jurisdictions, preference is given to lock cylinders in which there is lost motion between the
barrel and the cam. Lock cylinders that provide lost motion are often referred to as locks having
a "floating cam". Typically the cam is movable through 1800 in either direction from a home
position. That is the key insertion position.
 [0005] Disadvantages of the above discussed lock assemblies include complexity in respect of
locks that have a cam fixed to the barrel, while a further disadvantage is that manufactures have
to produce two different types of locks that basically perform the same function.

                                                   2
OBJECT

disadvantage.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
[0037] In the accompanying drawings there is schematically depicted a lock assembly 10 for a
sliding door or window. The lock assembly 10 includes a striker 11 to be fixed to a stationary
part of the door or window frame, with the operating mechanism 12 of the lock assembly 10
being attached to the sliding door or window.
[0038] The lock assembly 10 includes a base (body) 13 that includes a face plate 14 and a lock
body housing 15.
[0039] The face plate 14 and housing 15 cooperate to provide a cavity within which there is at
least partly located a locking bar (slide) 16.
[0040] The locking bar 16 includes an elongated central portion 17 that abuts a longitudinally
extending surface 18 of the face plate 14 so as to be guided in its sliding movement in the linear
direction 19. The locking bar 16 and face plate 14 are both longitudinally elongated in the
direction 19. The locking bar 16 has an aperture 51 through which the striker 11 may enter.
[0041] The lock bar 16 provides a socket 20 that supports a pawl 21. The pawl 21 is angularly
movable about an axis 22. The axis 22 is generally transverse (perpendicular) relative to the
direction 19. A spring 23 extends between the pawl 21 and locking bar 16 to urge the pawl 21 to
move angularly in the direction 24 about the axis 22.

                                                   6
[0042] The pawl 21 has a projection 25 that can engage a projection (abutment) 26 on the
housing 15, when aligned therewith in the direction 19. The axis 22 is spaced laterally relative to
said projection 26, in a direction transverse (preferably perpendicular) of the direction 19. The
projection extends from the pawl body 60 in a direction parallel to the axis 22.
[0043] The pawl 21 has a recess 27 within which there is located a spring 28 and pin 29. The
spring 28 is compressed so that the pin 29 is urged outwardly of the recess 27 in a direction 52.
The direction 52 is generally parallel to the axis 22.
[0044] A slide wall 30 of the housing 15 has a recess 31 providing a ramp surface 32 and an
abutment surface 33. The pin 29 is engagable in the recess 31, so as to slide along the surface
32, but abut the surface 33 to prevent movement of the pawl 29 in the direction 34 beyond a
predetermined position defined by the surface 33.
[0045] The housing 15 provides a socket 34 that supports a "crash" bar 35 for angular movement
about an axis 36. A spring 37 extends between the bar 35 and housing 15 to urge the bar 35 in
the direction 38.
[0046] The striker 11 includes a striker plate 39 from which there projects a hook tongue 40.
[0047] The face plate 14 has an aperture 41 through which the hook tongue 40 may pass.
[0048] In operation of the above described lock assembly 10, when the locking bar 16 is in the
"unlocked" (release) position shown in Figures 3 and 4, and 9 and 10, the hook tongue 40 may
enter and leave the operating mechanism 12 by entering and leaving the aperture 41.
[0049] However, when the hook tongue 40 projects through the aperture 41, so that the tongue
40 has its end extremity located within the operating mechanism 12, the striker 11 may be
maintained fixed to the base 13 by the locking bar 16 engaging the hook tongue 40 to prevent its
withdrawal back through the aperture 41, that is movement in the direction 42.
[0050] The locking bar 16 is moved between the abovementioned release position, and a
retaining position by movement in the direction 19 by operation of a lock cylinder 42. The lock
cylinder 42 has an outer housing 45, that receives a barrel 43 having a key slot. Fixed to the

                                                   7
inner end of the barrel 43 is a cam member 44. The barrel 43 is movable angularly about the
longitudinal axis 48 of the lock cylinder 42 by operation of a key.
[0051] The lock assembly 10 is adapted to operate irrespective of whether the cylinder 42 has
the cam member 44 fixed (fixed cylinder) to the barrel 43 so that there can be no relative
movement therebetween, or whether the cam member 44 (floating cylinder) is fixed to the barrel
43 so as to provide lost motion therebetween, as discussed previously.
[0052] The cylinder 42 is mounted in the socket 49 of the housing 15, with the barrel 43 moving
angularly about the axis 48. The axis 48 is generally parallel to the axes 22 and 36 and generally
transverse (perpendicular) to the direction 19 and the direction 46.
[0053] Preferably, the housing 15 includes a spring loaded ball 55, located in a recess 59 of the
housing 15, that is urged into engagement with a first 56 or a second depression 57 by a spring
58, to act as a locating means when the locking bar 16 is to be located in the release position and
the retaining position.
[0054] In operation of the above described lock assembly 10, with a fixed cylinder, the striker 11
(hook tongue 40) enters the aperture 41 so that the hook tongue 40 is located internally of the
operating mechanism 12. The striker 11 is maintained fixed to the base 13 if the locking bar 16
is moved in the direction 19 from the release position to the retaining position. In the retaining
position portion the locking bar 16 is located between the hook tongue 40 and the face plate 14
preventing movement of the striker 11 in the direction 46. The retaining position is shown in
Figures 3 to 8. The release position is shown in Figures 9 and 10. In the release position the
aperture 51 is aligned with the aperture 41 so that the hook tongue 40 can move through both
apertures 41 and 51. In the retaining position, the apertures 41 and 51 are only partly aligned.
[0055] The pawl 21 is movable angularly about the axis 22 between positions at which the
locking bar 16 is retained in the retaining position, or is permitted to move between the retaining
and release positions.
[0056] In Figures 5 and 6, the pawl 21 has its projection 25 aligned with the projection 26
preventing movement of the bar 16 to the release position. In Figures 3, 4 and 7 to 10, the
projection 25 is not aligned with the projection 26, the bar 16 is free to move. With reference to

                                                    8
Figures 9 and 10, the cam member 44 is moved angularly about the axis 48 until it engages the
body 60 of the pawl 21, and causes the pawl 21 to move angularly in a direction opposite the
direction 24, further compressing the spring 23. The projection 25 moves beneath the projection
26, with further angular movement of the cam member 44 causing the pawl 21 to move in the
direction 48 until the locking bar 16 is located between the hook tongue 40 and the face plate 14.
Thereafter, the cam member 44 moves from contact with the pawl 21, releasing the pawl 21 for
movement in the direction 24. However, the pin 29 will abut the surface 33 maintaining the
projection 25 aligned with the projection 26, that is preventing movement of the locking bar 16.
This is the "deadlock" position.
[0057] To release the striker 11, the barrel 43 is moved angularly in a direction opposite the
direction 48, so that the cam member 44 engages the body 60 of the pawl 21, causing it move in
a direction opposite the direction 24, that is a direction compressing the spring 23. The
projection 25 moves from alignment with the projection 26. Accordingly the locking bar 16 is
free for movement. However, the cam member 44 also engages an abutment surface 50 of the
locking bar 16 so that continued movement of the cam member 44 moves the locking bar 16 in a
direction opposite the direction 48, that is a position at which the locking bar 16 is not located
between the hook tongue 40 and the face plate 14. Accordingly, the striker 11 can be moved in
the direction 46 through the aligned apertures 41 and 51.
[0058] The key is further operated to move the cam member 44 until it is in the position as
shown in Figures 7 and 8. This enables removal of the key. However, the projections 25 and 26
are still not aligned, accordingly the locking bar 16 is free for movement and can be manually
manipulated in a "snib" operation by a user, that is moved between the release and retaining
positions.
[0059] If the locking bar 16 is free for movement, but is located in the retaining position, the
cylinder 42 is operated to move the cam member 44 to engage the pawl 21 to move the pawl 21
to compress the spring 23, with the pin 29 engaging in the recess 31 and abutting the surface 32,
so that the locking bar 16 is then maintained in the retaining position, that is the deadlock
position. To do so, the cam member 44 is moved in the angular direction 53, until the pin 29 is
engaged in the recess 31, and then is returned to the position shown in Figure 7 at which the key
may then be removed.

                                                   9
[0060] Where the cylinder 42 (floating cylinder) provides for lost motion between the barrel 43
and the cam member 44. If the lock assembly 10 is in the "deadlock" position as shown in
Figures 5 and 6, the lock assembly 10 can be operated by moving the cam member 44 in the
direction 53 until it engages the body 60 of the pawl 21 and moves the pawl 21 so that the
projections 25 and 26 are no longer engaged. The key would then be returned to the position at
which the key aperture is as shown in Figure 5. However, due to lost motion between the cam
member 44 and the barrel 43, the cam member 44 maintains its engagement with the pawl 21 to
maintain the pawl 21 in a position at which the projections 25 and 26 are not aligned. This
position is shown in Figure 3. Accordingly, the cam member 44 maintains the pawl 21 in a
position at which the locking bar 16 is free for movement between the retaining position and the
release position. The cam member 44 maintains its engagement with the pawl 21 by engagement
in the recess 54 of the pawl 21.    However, upon further angular movement of the key, and
therefore further angular movement of the cam member 44, the cam member 44 will engage the
surface 50 and move the locking bar 16 to the release position. The key would then be returned
to a position at which the key hole is located as shown in Figure 3. The key could be removed.
However, the pawl 21 is still retained in a position, by the cam member 44, maintaining the
projections 25 not aligned with the projection 26. This would be the "snib" operating position in
that the locking bar 16 is free for movement between its release and retaining positions.
[0061] When the locking bar 16 is in the "snib" mode of operation, and irrespective of whether it
is in the release or retaining positions, movement of the cam member 44 in the direction 48, will
move the locking bar 16 to the retaining position, if not already located therein, and then release
the pawl 21 so that it moves to a position at which the projections 25 and 26 are aligned, that is
the lock assembly 10 is in the "deadlocked" configuration. When the locking bar is in the "snib"
mode, the striker 11 can be selectively retained and released by movement of the bar 16.
[0062] To "deadlock" the lock assembly 10, the locking bar 16 is returned to the retaining
position. Thereafter the key is inserted in the barrel 43 and moved in a direction opposite the
direction 53 which will cause movement of the cam member 44 from engagement with the pawl
21. The pawl 21 will then move to a position aligning the projections 25 and 26 under the
influence of the spring 23 and engagement of the pin 29 with the surface 33.
[0063] The bar 35 is urged to engage the bar 16, to prevent movement of the bar 16 from the
release position to the retaining position unless the hook tongue 40 projects through the aligned

                                                  10
apertures 41 and 51 to engage the bar 35 to move it to a position at which it permits movement
of the bar 16 from the retaining position to the release position. This operation of the bar 35
prevents engagement of the hook tongue 40 with the bar 16 by preventing location of the bar 16
at a position projecting across the aperture 41. That is a position at which it could engage in an
impact with the hook tongue 40.
[0064] When using a fixed cylinder 42, the projection 24 moves along the paths 61 and 62
(Figure 8) when passing the projection 26, while when using a floating cam cylinder 42, the cam
member 44 moves the pawl 21 in a direction opposite the direction 24 so that the projection 24
moves only along the path 62 when passing the projection 26. The paths 61 and 62 are located
on opposite sides of the projection 26 and extend in the direction 19.
[0065] The projection 25 is movable angularly relative to the slide 16, about the axis 22,
between a first position aligned with the projection 26 to prevent movement of the slide 16, and
two release positions (second and third positions) along which the projection moves along one of
the paths 61 or 62 (for the fixed cam cylinder), or just the path 62 (for the floating cam cylinder).
