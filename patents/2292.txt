                                         Detailed Description
          For purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention,
reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings, and specific
language will be used to describe the same. It will nonetheless be understood that no
limitation of the scope of the invention is intended by the illustration and description
of certain embodiments of the invention. In addition, any alterations and/or
modifications of the illustrated and/or described embodiment(s) are contemplated as
being within the scope of the present invention. Further, any other applications of the
principles of the invention, as illustrated and/or described herein, as would normally
occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention pertains, are contemplated as being
within the scope of the present invention.
          Referring to the drawings, and in particular FIG. 1, some aspects of a non-limiting
example of a fuel cell system 10 in accordance with an embodiment of the present
invention is schematically depicted. In the embodiment of FIG. 1, various features,
components and interrelationships therebetween of aspects of an embodiment of the
present invention are depicted. However, the present invention is not limited to the
particular embodiment of FIG. 1 and the components, features and interrelationships
therebetween as are illustrated in FIG. 1 and described herein.
          The present embodiment of fuel cell system 10 includes a plurality of
electrochemical cells 12, i.e., individual fuel cells, formed on a substrate 14.
Electrochemical cells 12 are coupled together in series by interconnects 16. Fuel cell
system 10 is a segmented-in-series arrangement deposited on a flat porous ceramic
tube, although it will be understood that the present invention is equally applicable to
                                            Page 7
9690324 1

segmented-in-series arrangements on other substrates, such on a circular porous
ceramic tube. In various embodiments, fuel cell system 10 may be an integrated planar
fuel cell system or a tubular fuel cell system.
          Each electrochemical cell 12 of the present embodiment has an oxidant side 18
and a fuel side 20. The oxidant is typically air, but could also be pure oxygen (02) or
other oxidants, e.g., including dilute air for fuel cell systems having air recycle loops,
and is supplied to electrochemical cells 12 from oxidant side 18. Substrate 14 of the
present embodiment is porous, e.g., a porous ceramic material which is stable at fuel
cell operation conditions and chemically compatible with other fuel cell materials. In
other embodiments, substrate 14 may be a surface-modified material, e.g., a porous
ceramic material having a coating or other surface modification, e.g., configured to
prevent or reduce interaction between electrochemical cell 12 layers and substrate 14.
A fuel, such as a reformed hydrocarbon fuel, e.g., synthesis gas, is supplied to
electrochemical cells 12 from fuel side 20 via channels (not shown) in porous substrate
14. Although air and synthesis gas reformed from a hydrocarbon fuel are employed in
the present embodiment, it will be understood that electrochemical cells using other
oxidants and fuels may be employed without departing from the scope of the present
invention, e.g., pure hydrogen and pure oxygen. In addition, although fuel is supplied to
electrochemical cells 12 via substrate 14 in the present embodiment, it will be
understood that in other embodiments of the present invention, the oxidant may be
supplied to the electrochemical cells via a porous substrate.
          Referring to FIG. 2, some aspects of a non-limiting example of fuel cell system
10 are described in greater detail. Fuel cell system 10 can be formed of a plurality of
                                             Page 8
9690324 1

layers screen printed onto substrate 14. Screen printing is a process whereby a woven
mesh has openings through which the fuel cell layers are deposited onto substrate 14.
The openings of the screen determine the length and width of the printed layers.
Screen mesh, wire diameter, ink solids loading and ink rheology determine the
thickness of the printed layers. Fuel cell system 10 layers include an anode conductive
layer 22, an anode layer 24, an electrolyte layer 26, a cathode layer 28 and a cathode
conductive layer 30. In one form, electrolyte layer 26 is formed of an electrolyte sub
layer 26A and an electrolyte sub-layer 26B. In other embodiments, electrolyte layer 26
may be formed of any number of sub-layers. It will be understood that FIG. 2 is not to
scale; for example, vertical dimensions are exaggerated for purposes of clarity of
illustration.
          Interconnects for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are preferably electrically
conductive in order to transport electrons from one electrochemical cell to another;
mechanically and chemically stable under both oxidizing and reducing environments
during fuel cell operation; and nonporous, in order to prevent diffusion of the fuel and/or
oxidant through the interconnect. If the interconnect is porous, fuel may diffuse to the
oxidant side and burn, resulting in local hot spots that may result in a reduction of fuel
cell life, e.g., due to degradation of materials and mechanical failure, as well as reduced
efficiency of the fuel cell system. Similarly, the oxidant may diffuse to the fuel side,
resulting in burning of the fuel. Severe interconnect leakage may significantly reduce the
fuel utilization and performance of the fuel cell, or cause catastrophic failure of fuel cells
or stacks.
                                              Page 9
9690324 1

          For segmented-in-series cells, fuel cell components may be formed by depositing
thin films on a porous ceramic substrate, e.g., substrate 14. In one form, the films are
deposited via a screen printing process, including the interconnect. In other
embodiments, other process may be employed to deposit or otherwise form the thin
films onto the substrate. The thickness of interconnect layer may be 5 to 30 microns,
but can also be much thicker, e.g., 100 microns. If the interconnect is not fully
nonporous, e.g., due to sintering porosity, microcracks, voids and other defects
introduced during processing, gas or air flux through interconnect layer may be very
high, resulting in undesirable effects, as mentioned above. Accordingly, in one aspect
of the present invention, the interconnect (interconnect 16) is configured to minimize or
eliminate diffusion of the oxidant and fuel therethrough.
          The material of interconnect 16 of the present embodiment is a precious metal,
such as Ag, Pd, Au and/or Pt and/or alloys thereof, although other materials may be
employed without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, in
other embodiments, it is alternatively contemplated that other materials may be
employed, including precious metal alloys, such as Ag-Pd, Ag-Au, Ag-Pt, Au-Pd, Au-Pt,
Pt-Pd, Ag-Au-Pd, Ag-Au-Pt, Ag-Au-Pd-Pt and/or binary, ternary, quaternary alloys in the
Pt-Pd-Au-Ag family, inclusive of alloys having minor non-precious metal additions,
cermets composed of a precious metal, precious metal alloy, Ni metal and/or Ni alloy
and an inert ceramic phase, such as alumina, or ceramic phase with minimum ionic
conductivity which will not create significant parasitics, such as YSZ (yttria stabilized
zirconia, also known as yttria doped zirconia, yttria doping is 3-8 mol%, preferably 3-5
mol%), ScSZ (scandia stabilized zirconia, scandia doping is 4-10 mol%, preferably 4-6
                                           Page 10
9690324 1

mol%), and/or conductive ceramics, such as conductive perovskites with A or B-site
substitutions or doping to achieve adequate phase stability and/or sufficient conductivity
as an interconnect, e.g., including at least one of LNF (LaNixFe 1 .x03, preferably x=0.6),
LSM (Lai-xSrxMnO 3, x=0.1 to 0.3), doped ceria, doped strontium titanate (such as
LaxSr 1 .xTiO 3-a, x=0.1 to 0.3), LSCM (La1.xSrxCr1 .yMnyO 3, x=0.1 to 0.3 and y=0.25 to
0.75), doped yttrium chromites (such as Y 1.xCaxCrO 3- , x=0.1-0.3) and/or other doped
lanthanum chromites (such as La1.xCaxCrO 3 - ,x=0.15-0.3), and conductive ceramics,
such as at least one of LNF (LaNixFe 1.x0 3, preferably x=0.6), LSM (Lal-xSrxMnO 3, x=0.1
to 0.3), doped strontium titanate, doped yttrium chromites, LSCM (La1.xSrxCr1 .yMnyO 3),
and other doped lanthanum chromites. In some embodiments, it is contemplated that
all or part of interconnect 16 may be formed of a Ni metal cermet and/or a Ni alloy
cermet in addition to or in place of the materials mentioned above. The Ni metal cermet
and/or the Ni alloy cermet may have one or more ceramic phases, for example and
without limitation, a ceramic phase being YSZ (yttria doping is 3-8 mol%, preferably 3-5
mol%), alumina, ScSZ (scandia doping is 4-10 mol%, preferably 4-6 mol%), doped ceria
and/or TiO 2 .
          One example of materials for interconnect 16 is y(PdxPt 1.x)-(1-y)YSZ. Where x is
from 0 to 1 in weight ratio, preferably x is in the range of 0 to 0.5 for lower hydrogen flux.
Y is from 0.35 to 0.80 in volume ratio, preferably y is in the range of 0.4 to 0.6.
          Anode conductive layer 22 of the present embodiment is an electrode conductive
layer formed of a nickel cermet, such as such as Ni-YSZ (yttria doping in zirconia is 3-8
mol%,), Ni-ScSZ (scandia doping is 4-10 mol%, preferably second doping for phase
stability for 10 mol% scandia-ZrO 2) and/or Ni-doped ceria (such as Gd or Sm doping),
                                           Page 11
9690324 1

doped lanthanum chromite (such as Ca doping on A site and Zn doping on B site),
doped strontium titanate (such as La doping on A site and Mn doping on B site) and/or
La1 .xSrxMnyCr1 .yO3. Alternatively, it is considered that other materials for anode
conductive layer 22 may be employed such as cermets based in part or whole on
precious metal. Precious metals in the cermet may include, for example, Pt, Pd, Au,
Ag, and/or alloys thereof. The ceramic phase may include, for example, an inactive
non-electrically conductive phase, including, for example, YSZ, ScSZ and/or one or
more other inactive phases, e.g., having desired coefficients of thermal expansion
(CTE) in order to control the CTE of the layer to match the CTE of the substrate and
electrolyte. In some embodiments, the ceramic phase may include Al 2 O3 and/or a spinel
such as NiA12 O4 , MgA12 O4 , MgCr 2O 4 , NiCr 2 O4. In other embodiments, the ceramic
phase may be electrically conductive, e.g., doped lanthanum chromite, doped strontium
titanate and/or one or more forms of LaSrMnCrO.
          One example of anode conductive layer material is 76.5%Pd, 8.5%Ni, 15%3YSZ.
          Anode 24 may be formed of xNiO-(1 00-x)YSZ (x is from 55 to 75 in weight ratio),
yNiO-(100-y)ScSZ (y is from 55 to 75 in weight ratio), NiO-gadolinia stabilized ceria
(such as 55wt%NiO-45wt%GDC) and/or NiO samaria stabilized ceria in the present
embodiment, although other materials may be employed without departing from the
scope of the present invention. For example, it is alternatively considered that anode
layer 24 may be made of doped strontium titanate, and La 1.xSrxMnyCr 1.yO3 .(such as
Lao.75Sro.25 Mno.5 Cro.5O 3)

9690324 1

          Electrolyte layer 26 of the present embodiment, e.g., electrolyte sub-layer 26A
and/or electrolyte sub-layer 26B, may be made from a ceramic material. In one form, a
proton and/or oxygen ion conducting ceramic, may be employed. In one form,
electrolyte layer 26 is formed of YSZ, such as 3YSZ and/or 8YSZ. In other
embodiments, electrolyte layer 26 may be formed of ScSZ, such as 4ScSZ, 6ScSz
and/or 1OScSZ in addition to or in place of YSZ. In other embodiments, other materials
may be employed. For example, it is alternatively considered that electrolyte layer 26
may be made of doped ceria and/or doped lanthanum gallate. In any event, electrolyte
layer 26 is essentially impervious to diffusion therethrough of the fluids used by fuel cell
10, e.g., synthesis gas or pure hydrogen as fuel, as well as, e.g., air or 02 as an
oxidant, but allows diffusion of oxygen ions or protons.
          Cathode layer 28 may be formed at least one of of LSM (La 1 .SrxMnO 3,x=0.1 to
0.3), La 1 .SrxFeO 3 ,(such as x=0.3), La 1 .xSrxCoyFe 1 .yO3 (such as Lao.6Sro.4 Co.2 Feo.8 0 3 )
and/or Pr 1 .xSrxMnO 3 (such as Pro. 8 Sro.2 MnO 3 ), although other materials may be
employed without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, it is
alternatively considered that Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates and LaixCaxMnO 3 (such as
Lao.8Cao.2 MnO 3 ) materials may be employed.
          Cathode conductive layer 30 is an electrode conductive layer formed of a
conductive ceramic, for example, at least one of LaNixFe 1.X03 (such as LaNio.6 Feo. 4 0 3 ),
La 1 .xSrxMnO 3 (such as Lao.75Sro. 2 5MnO 3 ), doped lanthanum chromites (such as La 1.
xCaxCrO3-6 , x=0.15-0.3), and/or Pr1.xSrxCoO3, such as Pro. 8Sro.2 CO       3. In other
embodiments, cathode conductive layer 30 may be formed of other materials, e.g., a
precious metal cermet, although other materials may be employed without departing
                                              Page 13

from the scope of the present invention. The precious metals in the precious metal
cermet may include, for example, Pt, Pd, Au, Ag and/or alloys thereof. The ceramic
phase may include, for example, YSZ, ScSZ and A12 0 3 , or other ceramic materials.
          One example of cathode conductive layer materials is 80wt%Pd-20wt%LSM.
          In the embodiment of FIG. 2, various features, components and interrelationships
therebetween of aspects of an embodiment of the present invention are depicted.
However, the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiment of FIG. 2 and
the components, features and interrelationships therebetween as are illustrated in FIG.
2 and described herein.
          In the present embodiment, anode conductive layer 22 is printed directly onto
substrate 14, as is a portion of electrolyte sub-layer 26A. Anode layer 24 is printed onto
anode conductive layer 22. Portions of electrolyte layer 26 are printed onto anode layer
24, and portions of electrolyte layer 26 are printed onto anode conductive layer 22 and
onto substrate 14. Cathode layer 28 is printed on top of electrolyte layer 26. Portions of
cathode conductive layer 30 are printed onto cathode layer 28 and onto electrolyte layer
26. Cathode layer 28 is spaced apart from anode layer 24 in a direction 32 by the local
thickness of electrolyte layer 26.
          Anode layer 24 includes anode gaps 34, which extend in a direction 36.
Cathode layer 28 includes cathode gaps 38, which also extend in direction 36. In the
present embodiment, direction 36 is substantially perpendicular to direction 32, although
the present invention is not so limited. Gaps 34 separate anode layer 24 into a plurality
of individual anodes 40, one for each electrochemical cell 12. Gaps 38 separate
cathode layer 28 into a corresponding plurality of cathodes 42. Each anode 40 and the
                                           Page 14
9690324_1

corresponding cathode 42 that is spaced apart in direction 32 therefrom, in conjunction
with the portion of electrolyte layer 26 disposed therebetween, form an electrochemical
cell 12.
          Similarly, anode conductive layer 22 and cathode conductive layer 30 have
respective gaps 44 and 46 separating anode conductive layer 22 and cathode
conductive layer 30 into a plurality of respective anode conductor films 48 and cathode
conductor films 50. The terms, "anode conductive layer" and "anode conductor film"
may be used interchangeably, in as much as the latter is formed from one or more
layers of the former; and the terms, "cathode conductive layer" and "cathode conductor
film" may be used interchangeably, in as much as the latter is formed from one or more
layers of the former.
          In the present embodiment, anode conductive layer 22 has a thickness, i.e., as
measured in direction 32, of approximately 5-15 microns, although other values may be
employed without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, it is
considered that in other embodiments, the anode conductive layer may have a
thickness in the range of 5-50 microns. In yet other embodiments, different thicknesses
may be used, depending upon the particular material and application.
            Similarly, anode layer 24 has a thickness, i.e., as measured in direction 32, of
approximately 5-20 microns, although other values may be employed without departing
from the scope of the present invention. For example, it is considered that in other
embodiments, the anode layer may have a thickness in the range of 5-40 microns. In
yet other embodiments, different thicknesses may be used, depending upon the
particular anode material and application.

          Electrolyte layer 26, including both electrolyte sub-layer 26A and electrolyte sub
layer 26B, of the present embodiment has a thickness of approximately 5-15 microns
with individual sub-layer thicknesses of approximately 5 microns minimum, although
other thickness values may be employed without departing from the scope of the
present invention. For example, it is considered that in other embodiments, the
electrolyte layer may have a thickness in the range of 5-40 microns. In yet other
embodiments, different thicknesses may be used, depending upon the particular
materials and application.
          Cathode layer 28 has a thickness, i.e., as measured in direction 32, of
approximately 10-20 microns, although other values may be employed without
departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, it is considered that in
other embodiments, the cathode layer may have a thickness in the range of 10-50
microns. In yet other embodiments, different thicknesses may be used, depending
upon the particular cathode material and application.
          Cathode conductive layer 30 has a thickness, i.e., as measured in direction 32, of
approximately 5-100 microns, although other values may be employed without
departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, it is considered that in
other embodiments, the cathode conductive layer may have a thickness less than or
greater than the range of 5-100 microns. In yet other embodiments, different
thicknesses may be used, depending upon the particular cathode conductive layer
material and application.
          In each electrochemical cell 12, anode conductive layer 22 conducts free
electrons away from anode 24 and conducts the electrons to cathode conductive layer
                                             Page 16

30 via interconnect 16. Cathode conductive layer 30 conducts the electrons to cathode
28.
          Interconnect 16 is embedded in electrolyte layer 26, and is electrically coupled to
anode conductive layer 22, and extends in direction 32 from anode conductive layer 22
through electrolyte sub-layer 26A toward electrolyte sub-layer 26B, then in direction 36
from one electrochemical cell 12 to the next adjacent electrochemical cell 12, and then
in direction 32 again toward cathode conductive layer 30, to which interconnect 16 is
electrically coupled. In particular, at least a portion of interconnect 16 is embedded
within an extended portion of electrolyte layer 26, wherein the extended portion of
electrolyte layer 26 is a portion of electrolyte layer 26 that extends beyond anode 40
and cathode 42, e.g., in direction 32, and is not sandwiched between anode 40 and
cathode 42.
          Referring to FIG. 3, some aspects of a non-limiting example of interconnect 16
are described in greater detail. Interconnect 16 includes a blind primary conductor 52,
and two blind auxiliary conductors, or vias 54, 56. Blind primary conductor 52 is
sandwiched between electrolyte sub-layer 26A and electrolyte sub-layer 26B, and is
formed of a body 58 extending between a blind end 60 and a blind end 62 opposite end
60. Blind- primary conductor 52 defines a conduction path encased within electrolyte
layer 26 and oriented along direction 36, i.e., to conduct a flow of electrons in a direction
substantially parallel to direction 36. Blind auxiliary conductor 54 has a blind end 64,
and blind auxiliary conductor 56 has a blind end 66. Blind auxiliary conductors 54 and
56 are oriented in direction 32. As that term is used herein, "blind" relates to the
conductor not extending straight through electrolyte layer 26 in the direction of
                                           Page 17

orientation of the conductor, i.e., in the manner of a "blind hole" that ends in a structure,
as opposed to a "through hole" that passes through the structure. Rather, the blind
ends face portions of electrolyte layer 26. For example, end 64 of conductor 54 faces
portion 68 electrolyte sub-layer 26B and is not able to "see" through electrolyte sub
layer 26B. Similarly, end 66 of conductor 56 faces portion 70 of electrolyte sub-layer
26A and is not able to "see" through electrolyte sub-layer 26A. Likewise, ends 60 and
62 of body 58 face portions 72 and 74, respectively, and are not able to "see" through
electrolyte sub-layer 26A.
          In the embodiment of FIG. 3, various features, components and interrelationships
therebetween of aspects of an embodiment of the present invention are depicted.
However, the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiment of FIG. 3 and
the components, features and interrelationships therebetween as are illustrated in FIG.
3 and described herein. It will be understood that FIG. 3 is not to scale; for example,
vertical dimensions are exaggerated for purposes of clarity of illustration.
          In the present embodiment, blind primary conductor 52 is a conductive film
created with a screen printing process, which is embedded within electrolyte layer 26,
sandwiched between electrolyte sub-layers 26A and 26B. Anode layer 24 is oriented
along a first plane, cathode layer 28 is oriented along a second plane substantially
parallel to the first plane, electrolyte layer 26 is oriented along a third plane substantially
parallel to the first plane, and the conductive film forming blind primary conductor 52
extends in a direction substantially parallel to the first plane.
          In one form, the material of blind primary conductor 52 may be a precious metal
cermet or an electrically conductive ceramic. In other embodiments, other materials
                                             Page 18
9690324 1

may be employed in addition to or in place of a precious metal cermet or an electrically
conductive ceramic, e.g., a precious metal, such as Ag, Pd, Au and/or Pt, although
other materials may be employed without departing from the scope of the present
invention. In various embodiments, it is contemplated that one or more of many
materials may be employed, including precious metal alloys, such as Ag-Pd, Ag-Au, Ag
Pt, Au-Pd, Au-Pt, Pt-Pd, Ag-Au-Pd, Ag-Au-Pt, and Ag-Au-Pd-Pt, cermets composed of
precious metal or alloys, Ni metal and/or Ni alloy, and an inert ceramic phase, such as
alumina, or ceramic phase with minimum ionic conductivity which will not generate
significant parasitic current, such as YSZ, ScSZ, and/or conductive ceramics, such as at
least one of LNF (LaNixFe 1.x0 3), LSM (La1.xSrxMnO 3), doped strontium titanate, doped
yttrium chromites, LSCM (La1.xSrxCr1 .yMnyO 3), and/or other doped lanthanum chromites,
and conductive ceramics, such as LNF (LaNixFe 1 .x03), for example, LaNio.6 Feo4 0 3 , LSM
(La1 .xSrxMnO 3), such as Lao  75 Sro.2 5 MnO 3 , doped strontium titanate, doped yttrium
chromites, LSCM (La1.xSrxCr 1 .yMnyO 3), such as Lao 75 Sro.25 Cro.5 Mno05 O 3 , and other
doped lanthanum chromites. In other embodiments, it is contemplated that blind
primary conductor 52 may be formed of a Ni metal cermet and/or a Ni alloy cermet in
addition to or in place of the materials mentioned above. The Ni metal cermet and/or
the Ni alloy cermet may have one or more ceramic phases, for example and without
limitation, a ceramic phase being YSZ, alumina, ScSZ, doped ceria and/or TiO 2 . In
various embodiments, blind primary conductor 52 may be formed of materials set forth
above with respect to interconnect 16.
          One example of materials for blind primary conductor 52 is y(PdxPt 1.x)-(1-y)YSZ.
Where x is from 0 to 1 in weight ratio. For cost reduction, x is preferred in the range of
                                              Page 19
9690324 1

0.5 to 1. For better performance and higher system efficiency, x is prefered in the range
of 0 to 0.5. Because hydrogen has higher flux in Pd. Y is from 0.35 to 0.80 in volume
ratio, preferably y is in the range of 0.4 to 0.6.
          Another example of materials for blind primary conductor 52 is x%Pd-y%Ni-(100
x-y)%YSZ, where x=70-80, y=5-10.
          Each of blind auxiliary conductors 54 and 56 may be formed from the same or
different materials than primary conductor 52. In one form, blind auxiliary conductor 54
is formed during processing of blind primary conductor 52 and from the same material
as blind primary conductor 52, whereas blind auxiliary conductor 56 is formed at the
same process step as cathode conductive layer 30 and from the same material as
cathode conductive layer 30. However, in other embodiments, blind primary conductor
52, blind auxiliary conductor 54 and blind auxiliary conductor 56 may be made from
other material combinations without departing from the scope of the present invention.
          The materials used for blind auxiliary conductor 54 and blind auxiliary conductor
56 may vary with the particular application. For example, with some material
combinations, material migration may occur at the interface of interconnect 16 with
anode conductive layer 22 and/or cathode conductive layer 30 during either cell
fabrication or cell testing, which may cause increased resistance at the interface and
higher cell degradation during fuel cell operation. Material may migrate into primary
conductor 52 from anode conductive layer 22 and/or cathode conductive layer 30,
and/or material may migrate from primary conductor 52 into anode conductive layer 22
and/or cathode conductive layer 30, depending upon the compositions of primary
conductor 52, anode conductive layer 22 and cathode conductive layer 30. To reduce
                                            Page 20
9690324 1

material migration at the interconnect/conductive layer interface, one or both of blind
auxiliary conductor 54 and blind auxiliary conductor 56 may be formed from a material
that yields an electrically conductive chemical barrier layer between primary conductor
52 and a respective one or both of anode conductive layer 22 (anode conductor film 48)
and/or cathode conductive layer 30 (cathode conductor film 50). This chemical barrier
may eliminate or reduce material migration during fuel cell fabrication and operation.
          Materials for auxiliary conductor 54 at the interconnect 16 and anode conductive
layer 22 interface that may be used to form a chemical barrier may include, but are not
limited to Ni cermet, Ni-precious metal cermet and the precious metal can be Ag, Au,
Pd, Pt, or the alloy of them, the ceramic phase in the cermet can be at least one of YSZ
(yttria doping is 3-5 mol% in zironia), ScSZ (scandia doping is 4-6 mol% in zirconia) ,
doped ceria (such as GDC, or SDC), alumina, and TiO 2 , or conductive ceramics, such
as doped strontium titanate, doped yttrium chromites, La1.xSrxCr1.yMnyO 3 (x=0.15-0.35,
y=0.25-0.5), and other doped lanthanum chromites.
          One example of auxiliary conductor 54 is 50v%(5OPd5OPt)-50v%3YSZ.
          Another example of auxiliary conductor 54 is 15%Pd, 19%NiO, 66%NTZ, where
NTZ is 73.6wt% NiO, 20.0%TiO 2, 6.4% 3YSZ.
          Materials for auxiliary conductor 56 at the interconnect 16 and cathode
conductive layer 30 interface that may be used to form a chemical barrier may include,
but are not limited to precious metal cermets having a precious metal being at least one
of: Ag, Au, Pd, Pt, or its alloy, wherein the ceramic phase may be at least one of YSZ
(yttria doping is preferred from 3-5 mol%), ScSZ (scandia doping is preferred from 4-6
mol%), LNF (LaNixFej-x0 3, x=0.6), LSM (La1.xSrxMnO 3,x=0.1 to 0.3), doped yttrium
                                             Page 21
9690324 1

chromites (such as Yo.8 Cao.2 CrO 3 ), LSCM (La 1.xSrxCr 1.yMnyO 3 ), x=0.15-0.35, y=0.5
0.75), and other doped lanthanum chromites (such as Lao. 7Cao. 3 CrO      3), or conductive
ceramics, such as at least one of LNF (LaNixFej-x0 3), LSM (La1.xSrxMnO 3), Ruddlesden
Popper nickelates, LSF (such as Lao 8 Sro.2 FeO 3 ), LSCF (Lao 6 Sro4 Coo. 2 Feo8 O 3 ), LSCM
(La1 .xSrxCr 1.yMnyO 3 ), LCM (such as Lao.8Cao. 2MnO 3), doped yttrium chromites and
other doped lanthanum chromites.
          One example for auxiliary conductor 56 is 50v%(50Pd50Pt)-50v%3YSZ.
          Another example of auxiliary conductor 56 is 15%Pd, 19%NiO, 66%NTZ, where
NTZ is 73.6wt% NiO, 20.0%TiO 2, 6.4% 3YSZ.
          In the present embodiment, auxiliary conductor 54 has a width 76, i.e., in
direction 36, of approximately 0.4 mm, although greater or lesser widths may be used
without departing from the scope of the present invention. Similarly, auxiliary conductor
56 has a width 78, i.e., in direction 36, of approximately 0.4 mm, although greater or
lesser widths may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention.
Primary conductor 52 has a length in direction 36 that defines a minimum diffusion
distance 80 for any hydrogen that may diffuse through interconnect 16, e.g., due to
sintering porosity, microcracks, voids and/or other defects introduced into interconnect
16 during processing. In the present embodiment, diffusion distance 80 is 0.6 mm,
although greater or lesser widths may be used without departing from the scope of the
present invention. The film thickness 82 of primary conductor 52, i.e., as measured in
direction 32, is approximately 5-15 microns. The total height 84 of interconnect 16 in
direction 32 is approximately 10-25 microns, which generally corresponds to the
thickness of electrolyte layer 26.
                                           Page 22
9690324 1

          The total diffusion distance for hydrogen diffusing through interconnect 16 may
include the height of auxiliary conductor 54 and auxiliary conductor 56 in direction 32,
which may be given by subtracting from the total height 84 the film thickness 82 of
primary conductor 52, which yields approximately 10 microns. Thus, the diffusion
distance is predominantly controlled by diffusion distance 80, e.g., since the heights of
auxiliary conductors 54 and 56 represent only a small fraction of the total diffusion
distance.
          Referring to FIGS. 4A and 4B, a plan view of a continuous "strip" configuration of
interconnect 16 and a plan view of a "via" configuration of interconnect 16 are
respectively depicted. The term, "strip," pertains to the configuration being in the form
of a single long conductor that is comparatively narrow in width as compared to length.
In the strip configuration, the primary conductor takes the form of a continuous strip 52A
extending in a direction 86 that in the present embodiment is substantially perpendicular
to both directions 32 and 36, and runs approximately the length in direction 86 of
electrochemical cell 12. In the depiction of FIGS. 4A and 4B, direction 32 extends into
and out of the plane of the drawing, and hence is represented by an "X" within a circle.
The term, "via," pertains to a relatively small conductive pathway through a material that
connects electrical components. In the depiction of FIG. 4B, the primary conductor
takes the form of a plurality of vias 52B, e.g., each having a width in direction 86 of only
approximately 0.4 mm, although greater or lesser widths may be used without departing
from the scope of the present invention.
          In the embodiment of FIGS. 4A and 4B, various features, components and
interrelationships therebetween of aspects of an embodiment of the present invention
                                             Page 23

are depicted. However, the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiment
of FIGS. 4A and 4B and the components, features and interrelationships therebetween
as are illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B and described herein.
          Referring again to FIG. 3, in conjunction with FIGS. 4A and 4B, the minimum
diffusion area of interconnect 16 is controlled by the diffusion area of primary conductor
52, which serves as a diffusion flow orifice that restricts the diffusion of fluid. For
example, if, for any reason, primary conductor 52 is not non-porous, fluid, e.g., oxidant
and fuel in liquid and/or gaseous form may diffuse through interconnect 16. Such
diffusion is controlled, in part, by the film thickness 82. In the "strip" configuration, the
diffusion area is given by the width of continuous strip 52A in direction 86 times the film
thickness 82, whereas in the "via" configuration, the diffusion area is given by the width
of each via 52B in direction 86 times the film thickness 82 times the number of vias 52B.
          Although it may be possible to employ an interconnect that extends only in
direction 32 from anode conductor film 48 to cathode conductor film 50 (assuming that
cathode conductor film 50 were positioned above anode conductor films 48 in direction
36), such a scheme would result in higher leakage than were the interconnect of the
present invention employed.
          For example, referring to FIG. 5, some aspects of a non-limiting example of an
interconnect 88 are depicted, wherein interconnect 88 in the form of a via passing
through an electrolyte layer 90, which is clearly not embedded in electrolyte layer 90 or
sandwiched between sub-layers of electrolyte layer 90, and does not include any blind
conductors. Interconnect 88 transfers electrical power from an anode conductor 92 to a
cathode conductor 94. For purposes of comparison, the length 96 of interconnect 88 in
                                             Page 24
9690324 1

direction 32, which corresponds to the thickness of electrolyte layer 90, is assumed to
be the 10-15 microns, e.g., similar to interconnect 16, and the width of interconnect 88,
e.g., the width of the open slot in the electrolyte 96 into which interconnect 88 is printed,
in direction 36 is assumed to be the minimum printable via dimension 98 in direction 36
with current industry technology, which is approximately 0.25 mm. The length of
interconnect 88 in direction 86 is assumed to be 0.4 mm. Thus, with interconnect 88,
the diffusion flow area for one via is approximately 0.25 mm times 0.4 mm, which equals
0.1 mm2 . The limiting dimension is the minimum 0.25 mm screen printed via dimension
98.
          With the present invention, however, assuming via 52B (FIG. 4B) to have the
same length in direction 86 of 0.4 mm, the diffusion flow area for one via of 0.4 mm
times the film thickness in direction 32 of 0.010 mm (10 microns) equals .004 mm 2
which is only 4 percent of the flow area of interconnect 88. Thus, by employing a
geometry that allows a reduction of the minimum dimension that limits a minimum
diffusion flow area, the diffusion flow area of the interconnect may be reduced, thereby
potentially decreasing diffusion of oxidant and/or fuel through the interconnector, e.g., in
the event the interconnect is not fully non-porous (such as, for example, due to process
limitations and/or manufacturing defects), or the interconnect is a mixed ion and
electronic conductor.
          Further, the diffusion distance in interconnect 88 corresponds to the thickness 96
of interconnect 88, which in the depicted example is also the thickness of electrolyte
layer 90, i.e., 10-15 microns.
                                             Page 25
9690324 1

          In contrast, the diffusion distance of the inventive blind primary connector 52,
whether in the form of a continuous strip 52A or a via 52B, is diffusion distance 80,
which is 0.6 mm, and which is 40-60 times the diffusion distance of interconnect 88 (0.6
mm divided by 10-15 microns), which is many times the thickness of the electrolyte.
Thus, by employing a geometry wherein the diffusion distance extends in a direction not
limited by the thickness of the electrolyte, the diffusion distance of the interconnect may
be substantially increased, thereby potentially decreasing diffusion of oxidant and/or fuel
through the interconnector.
          Generally, the flow of fuel and/or air through an interconnect made from a given
material and microstructure depends on the flow area and flow distance. Some
embodiments of the present invention may reduce fuel and/or air flow through the
interconnect by 102 to 10 4 magnitude, e.g., if the connector is not non-porous,
depending on the specific dimension of the interconnect used.
          For example, processing-related defects such as sintering porosity, microcracks
and voids are typically from sub-microns to a few microns in size (voids) or a few
microns to 10 microns (microcracks). With a diffusion distance of only 10-15 microns,
the presence of a defect may provide a direct flowpath through the interconnect, or at
least decrease the diffusion distance by a substantial percentage. For example,
assume a design diffusion distance of 10 microns. In the presence of a 10 micron
defect, a direct flowpath for the flow of hydrogen and/or oxidant would occur, since such
a defect would open a direct pathway through the interconnect (it is noted that the
anode/conductive layer and cathode/conductive layer are intentionally porous). Even
assuming a design diffusion distance of 15 microns in the presence of a 10 micron
                                             Page 26
9690324_1

defect, the diffusion distance would be reduced by 67%, leaving a net diffusion distance
of only 5 microns.
          On the other hand, a 10 micron defect in the inventive interconnect 16 would
have only negligible effect on the 0.6 mm design diffusion distance of primary conductor
52, i.e., reducing the 0.6 mm design diffusion distance to 0.59 mm, which is a relatively
inconsequential reduction caused by the presence of the defect.
          Referring to FIGS. 6A and 6B, some aspects of a non-limiting example of an
embodiment of the present invention having a blind primary conductor in the form of a
via 52C extending in direction 86 are depicted. In the depiction of FIG. 6A, direction 32
extends into and out of the plane of the drawing, and hence is represented by an "X"
within a circle. In the depiction of FIG. 6B, direction 36 extends into and out of the plane
of the drawing, and hence is represented by an "X" within a circle. Via 52C is similar to
via 52B, except that it extends in direction 86 rather than direction 36, for example, as
indicated by diffusion distance 80 being oriented in direction 86. It will be understood
that although FIGS. 6A and 6B depict only a single via 52C, embodiments of the
present invention may include a plurality of such vias extending along direction 86.
          The direction of electron flow in FIGS. 6A and 6B is illustrated by three
dimensional flowpath line 100. Electrons flow in direction 36 through anode conductor
film 48 toward auxiliary conductor 54, and then flow in direction 32 through auxiliary
conductor 54 toward via 52C. The electrons then flow in direction 86 through via 52C
toward auxiliary conductor 56, and then flow in direction 32 through auxiliary conductor
56 into cathode conductor film 50, after which the electrons flow in direction 36 through
cathode conductor film 50, e.g., to the next electrochemical cell.

          In the embodiment of FIGS. 6A and 6B, various features, components and
interrelationships therebetween of aspects of an embodiment of the present invention
are depicted. However, the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiment
of FIGS. 6A and 6B and the components, features and interrelationships therebetween
as are illustrated in FIGS. 6A and 6B and described herein.
          Referring to FIG. 7, some aspects of a non-limiting example of an embodiment of
a fuel cell system 210 are schematically depicted. Fuel cell system 210 includes a
plurality of electrochemical cells 212 disposed on a substrate 214, each electrochemical
cell 212 having a seal in the form of a ceramic seal 102. Fuel cell system 210 also
includes the components set forth above and described with respect to fuel cell system
10, e.g., including interconnects 16 having blind primary conductors 52 and blind
auxiliary conductors or vias 54 and 56; an oxidant side 18; a fuel side 20; electrolyte
layers 26; anodes 40; cathodes 42, anode conductor films 48 and cathode conductor
films 50. The description of substrate 14 applies equally to substrate 214. In the
embodiment of FIG. 7, auxiliary conductor 56 of interconnect 16 is formed of the same
material as cathode conductor film 50, whereas auxiliary conductor 54 of interconnect
16 is formed of the same material as anode conductor film 48. Blind primary conductor
52 of interconnect 16 is formed of the same material described above with respect to
interconnect 16 in the embodiment of FIG. 2. In other embodiments, for example,
auxiliary conductor 54 and/or auxiliary conductor 56 may be formed of the same
material as blind primary conductor 52, or may be formed of different materials. In one
form, blind primary conductor 52 is in the form of a continuous strip, e.g., continuous
strip 52A depicted in FIG. 4A. In another form, blind primary conductor 52 is in the form
                                          Page 28
9690324 1

of a plurality of vias, such as vias 52B in FIG. 4B. In other embodiments, blind primary
conductor 52 may take other forms not explicitly set forth herein.
            In one form, ceramic seal 102 is applied onto porous substrate 214, and is
positioned horizontally (in the perspective of FIG. 7) between the anode conductor film
48 of one electrochemical cell 212 and the auxiliary conductor 54 of the adjacent
electrochemical cell 212. In other embodiments, ceramic seal 102 may be located in
other orientations and locations. Ceramic seal 102 has a thickness, i.e., as measured in
direction 32, of approximately 5-30 microns, although other thickness values may be
employed in other embodiments. In one form, ceramic seal 102 is impervious to gases
and liquids, such as the fuel and oxidants employed by electrochemical cells 212, and is
configured to prevent the leakage of gases and liquids from substrate 214 in those
areas where it is applied. In other embodiments, ceramic seal 102 may be substantially
impervious to gases and liquids, and may be configured to reduce leakage of gases and
liquids from substrate 214 in those areas where it is applied, e.g., relative to other
configurations that do not employ a ceramic seal. Ceramic seal 102 is configured to
provide an essentially "gas-tight" seal between substrate 214 and fuel cell components
disposed on the side of ceramic seal 102 opposite of that of substrate 214.
          In one form, ceramic seal 102 is positioned to prevent or reduce leakage of
gases and liquids from substrate 214 into interconnect 16. In one form, ceramic seal
102 extends in direction 36, and is positioned vertically (in direction 32) between porous
substrate 214 on the bottom and blind primary conductor 52 of interconnect 16 and
electrolyte 26 on the top, thereby preventing the leakages of gases and liquids into the
portions of blind primary conductor 52 (and electrolyte 26) that are overlapped by
                                           Page 29
9690324 1

ceramic seal 102. In other embodiments, ceramic seal 102 may be disposed in other
suitable locations in addition to or in place of that illustrated in FIG. 7. Blind primary
conductor 52 is embedded between a portion of ceramic seal 102 on the bottom and a
portion of extended electrolyte 26 on the top. The diffusion distance in the embodiment
of FIG. 7 is primarily defined by the length of the overlap of interconnect 16 by both
ceramic seal 102 and electrolyte 26 in direction 36. In one form, the overlap is 0.3-0.6
mm, although in other embodiments, other values may be employed. Interconnect 16
extends into the active electrochemical cell 212 area. In some embodiments, the
primary interconnect area of the configuration illustrated in FIG. 7 may be smaller than
other designs, which may increase the total active cell area on substrate 214, which
may increase the efficiency of fuel cell system 210.
          Ceramic seal 102 is formed from a ceramic material. In one form, the ceramic
material used to form ceramic seal 102 is yittria stabilized zirconia, such as 3YSZ. In
another form, the material used to form ceramic seal 102 is scandia stabilized zirconia,
such as 4ScSZ. In another form, the material used to form ceramic seal 102 is alumina.
In another form, the material used to form ceramic seal 102 is non-conductive
pyrochlore materials, such as La2 Zr 2 O7 . Other embodiments may employ other
ceramics, e.g., depending upon various factors, such as compatibility with the materials
of adjacent portions of each electrochemical cell 212 and substrate 214, the fuels and
oxidants employed by fuel cell system 210, and the local transient and steady-state
operating temperatures of fuel cell system 210. Still other embodiments may employ
materials other than ceramics.

          In the embodiment of FIG. 7, various features, components and interrelationships
therebetween of aspects of an embodiment of the present invention are depicted.
However, the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiment of FIG. 7 and
the components, features and interrelationships therebetween as are illustrated in FIG.
7 and described herein.
          Referring to FIG. 8, some aspects of a non-limiting example of an embodiment of
a fuel cell system 310 are schematically depicted. Fuel cell system 310 includes a
plurality of electrochemical cells 312 disposed on a substrate 314, each electrochemical
cell 312 including a ceramic seal 102. Fuel cell system 310 also includes the
components set forth above and described with respect to fuel cell system 10, e.g.,
including interconnects 16 having blind primary conductors 52 and blind auxiliary
conductors or vias 54 and 56; an oxidant side 18; a fuel side 20; electrolyte layers 26;
anodes 40; cathodes 42, anode conductor films 48 and cathode conductor films 50.
The description of substrate 14 applies equally to substrate 314. In the embodiment of
FIG. 8, interconnect 16 is formed predominantly by the material of anode conductor film
48, and hence, blind primary conductor 52 and auxiliary conductor 54 in the
embodiment of FIG. 8 may be considered as extensions of anode conductor film 48.
For example, blind primary conductor 52 and auxiliary conductor 54 are depicted as
being formed by the material of anode conductor film 48, whereas auxiliary conductor
56 is formed of the materials set forth above for interconnect 16 in the embodiment of
FIG. 2. In one form, blind primary conductor 52 is in the form of a continuous strip, e.g.,
continuous strip 52A depicted in FIG. 4A. In another form, blind primary conductor 52 is
                                           Page 31
9690324 1

in the form of a plurality of vias, such as vias 52B in FIG. 4B. In other embodiments,
blind primary conductor 52 may take other forms not explicitly set forth herein.
          Ceramic seal 102 is positioned to prevent or reduce leakage of gases and liquids
from substrate 314 into interconnect 16. In one form, ceramic seal 102 is positioned
vertically (in direction 32) between porous substrate 314 on the bottom and blind
primary conductor 52 and electrolyte 26 on the top, thereby preventing the leakages of
gases and liquids into the portions of blind primary conductor 52 that are overlapped by
ceramic seal 102. Blind primary conductor 52 is embedded between a portion of
ceramic seal 102 on the bottom and extended electrolyte 26 on the top. The diffusion
distance in the embodiment of FIG. 8 is primarily defined by the length of the overlap of
interconnect 16 by both ceramic seal 102 and electrolyte 26 in direction 36. In one
form, the overlap is 0.3-0.6 mm, although in other embodiments, other values may be
employed.
          Because ceramic seal 102 prevents the ingress of gas and liquids into
electrochemical cell 312, interconnect 16 does not need to be as dense (in order to
prevent or reduce leakage) as other designs that do not include a seal, such as ceramic
seal 102. In such designs, interconnect 16 may be formed of the materials used to form
anode conductor layer 48 and/or cathode conductor layer 50. For example, referring to
FIG. 9, an embodiment is depicted wherein interconnect 16 is formed entirely of the
materials used to form anode conductor layer 48 and cathode conductor layer 50. FIG.
9 schematically depicts some aspects of a non-limiting example of an embodiment of a
fuel cell system 410. Fuel cell system 410 includes a plurality of electrochemical cells
412 disposed on a substrate 414, each electrochemical cell 412 including a ceramic

seal 102. Fuel cell system 410 also includes the components set forth above and
described with respect to fuel cell system 10, e.g., including interconnects 16 having
blind primary conductors 52 and blind auxiliary conductors or vias 54 and 56; an oxidant
side 18; a fuel side 20; electrolyte layers 26; anodes 40; cathodes 42, anode conductor
films 48 and cathode conductor films 50. The description of substrate 14 applies
equally to substrate 414. In the embodiment of FIG. 9, blind primary conductor 52 and
auxiliary conductor 54 are formed of the same material used to form anode conductor
film 48, and are formed in the same process steps used to form anode conductor film
48. Hence, blind primary conductor 52 and auxiliary conductor 54 in the embodiment of
FIG. 9 may be considered as extensions of anode conductor film 48. Similarly, in the
embodiment of FIG. 9, auxiliary conductor 56 is formed of the same material used to
form cathode conductor film 50, and is formed in the same process steps used to form
cathode conductor film 50. Hence, auxiliary conductor 56 in the embodiment of FIG. 9
may be considered as an extension of cathode conductor film 50.
          In the embodiments of FIGS. 8 and 9, various features, components and
interrelationships therebetween of aspects of embodiments of the present invention are
depicted. However, the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiments of
FIGS. 8 and 9 and the components, features and interrelationships therebetween as are
illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9 and described herein.
          Referring to FIGS. 10-15 generally, the inventors have determined that material
diffusion between the interconnect and adjacent components, e.g., an anode and/or an
anode conductor film and/or cathode and/or cathode conductor film, may adversely
affect the performance of certain fuel cell systems. Hence, some embodiments of the
                                           Page 33
9690324 1

present invention include an electrically conductive chemical barrier (e.g., as discussed
above, and/or chemical barrier 104, discussed below with respect to FIGS. 10-15) to
prevent or reduce such material diffusion. In various embodiments, chemical barrier
104 may be configured to prevent or reduce material migration or diffusion at the
interface between the interconnect and an anode, and and/or between the interconnect
and an anode conductor film, and/or between the interconnect and a cathode, and
and/or between the interconnect and a cathode conductor film which may improve the
long term durability of the interconnect. For example, without a chemical barrier,
material migration (diffusion) may take place at the interface between an interconnect
formed of a precious metal cermet, and an anode conductor film and/or anode formed
of a Ni-based cermet. The material migration may take place in both directions, e.g., Ni
migrating from the anode conductive layer/conductor film and/or anode into the
interconnect, and precious metal migrating from the interconnect into the conductive
layer/conductor film and/or anode. The material migration may result in increased
porosity at or near the interface between the interconnect and the anode conductor film
and/or anode, and may result in the enrichment of one or more non or low-electronic
conducting phases at the interface, yielding a higher area specific resistance (ASR),
and hence resulting in reduced fuel cell performance. Material migration between the
interconnect and the cathode and/or between the interconnect and the cathode
conductor film may also or alternatively result in deleterious effects on fuel cell
performance.
          Accordingly, some embodiments employ a chemical barrier, e.g., chemical
barrier 104, that is configured to prevent or reduce material migration or diffusion at the
                                          Page 34
9690324 1

interface between the interconnect and an adjacent electrically conductive component,
such as one or more of an anode, an anode conductive layer/conductor film, a cathode
and/or a cathode conductive layer/conductor film, and hence prevent or reduce material
migration (diffusion) that might otherwise result in deleterious effect, e.g., the formation
of porosity and the enrichment of one or more non or low-electronic conducting phases
at the interface. Chemical barrier 104 may be formed of one or both of two classes of
materials; cermet and/or conductive ceramic. For the cermet, the ceramic phase may
be one or more of an inert filler; a ceramic with low ionic conductivity, such as YSZ; and
an electronic conductor. In various embodiments, e.g., for the anode side (e.g., for use
adjacent to an anode and/or anode conductive layer/conductor film), chemical barrier
104 may be formed of one or more materials, including, without limitation, Ni cermet or
Ni-precious metal cermet. The precious metal phase may be, for example and without
limitation, one or more of Ag, Au, Pd, Pt, or one or more alloys of Ag, Au, Pd and/or Pt.
The ceramic phase in the cermet may be, for example and without limitation, be at least
one of YSZ (such as 3YSZ), ScSZ (such as 4ScSZ), doped ceria (such as Gdo.1 Ceo.g
02),     SrZrO 3 , pyrochlores of the composition (MRE)2Zr207 (where MRE = one or more rare
earth cations, for example and without limitation La, Pr, Nd, Gd, Sm, Ho, Er, and/or Yb),
for example and without limitation, La 2 Zr 2 O7 and Pr 2 Zr 2O7 , alumina, and TiO 2 , or one or
more electronically conductive ceramics, such as doped ceria (higher electronic
conductivity at lower oxygen partial pressure to provide low enough ASR due to thin
film), doped strontium titanate, LSCM (La 1.xSrxCr1.yMnyO 3, x=0.15-0.35, y=0.25-0.5),
and/or other doped lanthanum chromites and doped yttria chromites. In various
embodiments, e.g., for the cathode side(e.g., for use adjacent to a cathode and/or
                                              Page 35
9690324_1

cathode conductive layer/conductor film), chemical barrier 104 may be formed of one or
more materials, including, without limitation precious metal cermet. The precious metal
phase may be, for example and without limitation, one or more of Ag, Au, Pd, Pt, or one
or more alloys of Ag, Au, Pd and/or Pt. The ceramic phase in the cermet may be, for
example and without limitation, be at least one of YSZ, ScSZ, doped ceria, SrZrO 3,
pyrochlores of the composition (MRE)2Zr2O7 (where MRE = one or more rare earth
cations, for example and without limitation La, Pr, Nd, Gd, Sm, Ho, Er, and/or Yb), for
example and without limitation, La 2 Zr 2 O7 and Pr 2Zr 2O7 , alumina, and TiO 2 , or one or
more electronically conductive ceramics, such as LNF (LaNixFe 1 .x03, such as x=0.6)
LSM (La 1 .xSrxMnO 3, x=0.15-0.3), LCM (such as Lao.8 Cao. 2MnO 3), Ruddlesden-Popper
nickelates, LSF (such as Lao.8 Sro. 2 FeO 3 ), LSCF (Lao. 6Sro. 4C00o. 2 Feo. 8 O 3 ), LSCM (Lai
xSrxCr    1 .yMnyO 3 , x=O.15-0.35, y=0.5-0.75) doped yttrium chromites, and other doped
lanthanum chromites. The selection of the specific material(s) for chemical barrier 104
may vary with the needs of the application, e.g., depending upon cost, ease of
manufacturing, the type of materials used for the component(s) electrically adjacent to
interconnect 16 and/or one of its subcomponents, e.g., blind primary conductor 52,
auxiliary conductor 54 and auxiliary conductor 56.
          One example of anode side chemical barrier materials is 15%Pd, 19%NiO,
66%NTZ, where NTZ is 73.6wt% NiO, 20.0%TiO 2, 6.4% YSZ.
          Another example of anode side chemical barrier materials is doped ceria, such
as Gdo.1 Ceo.9 02.
          Experimental testing with a chemical barrier, such as chemical barrier 104, in a
fuel cell system yielded approximately 0.1% per thousand hour degradation rate in cell
                                              Page 36

power output over the course of 1300 hours of testing using a chemical barrier formed
of 30wt%Pd-70wt%NTZ cermet (NTZ = NiO 2-3YSZ), disposed between an interconnect
formed of 65Pd35Pt-YSZ cermet and an anode conductive layer formed of 20wt%Pd
Ni-spinel. In a comparative test, but without the inclusion of a chemical barrier, such as
chemical barrier 104, an interconnect formed of 50v%(96Pd6Au)-50v%YSZ cermet
directly interfacing with an anode conductive layer formed of 20wt%Pd-Ni-spinel
showed significant degradation in about 10 hours of testing, and fuel cell failure at about
25 hours of testing resulting from material migration between the interconnect and the
anode conductive layer. In another test, two fuel cells were tested using a chemical
barrier 104 formed of a conductive ceramic (10mol%Gd doped CeO 2) disposed
between disposed between an anode conductor film and an interconnect. ASR for the
interconnect showed no degradation after approximately 8000 hours of testing, and
instead showed slight improvement, yielding final values of .05 ohm-cm 2 and .06 ohm
cm2 in the two test articles.

          Referring to FIGS. 16-19 generally, the inventors have determined that in some
fuel cells, under some operating conditions, the cathode conductive layer/conductor
film, the electrolyte, and portions of the interconnect, e.g., vias, can form parasitic cells
within or between each electrochemical cell, particularly where there is overlap between
the cathode conductive layer/conductor film and the electrolyte. In the parasitic cells,
the cathode conductive layer/conductor film functions as a cathode, and the
interconnect, e.g., vias formed of precious metal cermet, function as an anode. The
parasitic cells consume fuel during fuel cell operation, thereby reducing the efficiency of
the fuel cell system. In addition, the steam generated by the parasitic cells may create
local high oxygen partial pressure that may result in the oxidation of Ni that may have
                                            Page 43

diffused into precious metal phase of the interconnect (e.g., via) materials, resulting in
degradation of the interconnect.
          The inventors performed tests that confirmed the existence of parasitic cells.
The tests confirmed that, although significant degradation did not occur at some
temperatures, e.g., 9000 C, under the testing times, degradation of the interconnect
occurred at higher operating temperatures, e.g., 925 0 C after approximately 700 hours of
testing. Post test analysis showed Ni migration from the anode conductive
layer/conductor film side to the cathode conductive layer/conductor film side of the
interconnect through the precious metal phase in blind primary conductor 52, which was
accelerated by the higher operating temperature. A high oxygen partial pressure
resulting from steam formed by the parasitic cells caused Ni oxidation at the interface of
extended electrolyte 26 and blind primary interconnect 52 near the boundary between
the cathode conductive layer/conductor film and the electrolyte, which segregated from
the precious metal of the interconnect. Continued NiO accumulation at the interface
between the blind primary conductor 52 and the electrolyte 26, and continued Ni
migration would likely result in failure of the interconnect.
          In order to prevent overlap between the cathode conductive layer/conductor film
and the electrolyte, in various embodiments the inventors employed a separation
feature (gap 106 of FIGS. 16 and 17; and insulator 108 of FIGS. 18 and 19) between
the cathode conductive layer/conductor film and the electrolyte to separate, i.e., space
apart, the cathode conductive layer/conductor film and the electrolyte from contacting
each other, thus eliminating the parasitic cells. Testing of fuel cell systems with a
separation feature in the form of gap 106 (and also including a chemical barrier 104

formed of Pd-Ni alloy cermet) for approximately 2000 hours, including approximately
1000 hours at aggressive conditions (925 0 C and fuel consisting of 20% H2 , 10% CO,
19% CO 2 , 47% steam and 4% N2) did not result in degradation of the interconnect.
Accordingly, some embodiments of the present invention include a separation feature,
e.g., gap 106, between the cathode conductive layer/conductor film and the electrolyte,
which prevents the establishment of parasitic cells.
          Referring to FIG. 16, some aspects of a non-limiting example of an embodiment
of a fuel cell system 1110 are schematically depicted. Fuel cell system 1110 includes a

FIGS. 16-19 and the components, features and interrelationships therebetween as are
illustrated in FIGS. 16-19 and described herein.
          As mentioned above with respect to FIGS. 16-19, under certain conditions,
parasitic cells may be undesirably formed. The embodiments discussed above with
respect to FIGS. 16-19 provide certain approaches to resolving the parasitic cell

problem, based on material selection, e.g., the material from which the interconnect
and/or vias (e.g., interconnect 16, including blind primary conductor 52, auxiliary
conductor 54 and/or auxiliary conductor 56, and/or other interconnect and/or via
configurations not mentioned herein) are formed. In one form, for an alternate cermet
material, precious metal- La2 Zr 2 O7 pyrochlore cermet may be employed for primary
interconnect material for segmented-in-series fuel cell, or via material for multi-layer
ceramic interconnect. In the such a cermet material, La2 Zr 2 O7 pyrochlore could fully
replace doped zirconia, or partially replace doped zirconia to keep ionic phase below its
percolation to eliminate or reduce ionic conduction.
          In one form, the composition of the interconnect and/or via(s), e.g., one or more
of the previously mentioned compositions for the interconnect and/or via(s), is altered to
include non-ionic conducting ceramic phases in the composition of the interconnect
and/or via(s).
          For example, in one form, the interconnect and/or via may be formed, all or in
part, of a cermet, such as those previously described with respect to interconnect 16,
including blind primary conductor 52, auxiliary conductor 54 and/or auxiliary conductor
56, but also or alternatively including one or more non-ionic conductive ceramic phases.
Examples include, without limitation, SrZrO 3, La2 Zr 2 O7 pyrochlore, Pr 2 Zr 2 O7 pyrochlore,
BaZrO 3 , MgA12 O4 spinel, NiA12O4 spinel, MgCr 2 O4 spinel, NiCr 2O 4 spinel, Y 3 Al5 0 1 2 and
other garnets with various A- and B-site substitution, and alumina. Other non-ionic
conductive ceramic phases are also contemplated herein in addition to or in place of the
examples set forth herein. Considerations for materials may include the coefficient of
thermal expansion of the ceramic phase(s), e.g., relative to the coefficient thermal
                                            Page 52

expansion of the porous substrate. In some embodiments, preferred materials for
chemical compatibility with adjacent fuel cell layers may include precious metal
pyrochlore cermets, wherein the general class of pyrochlores is (MRE)2Zr2O7, wherein
MRE is a rare earth cation, for example and without limtiation La, Pr, Nd, Gd, Sm, Ho, Er,
and/or Yb.
          In other embodiments, nonionic phases such as SrZrO 3, MgA12O4 spinel, NiA12O4
spinel, alumina and pyrochlore compositions partially or completely replace the ionic
conducting YSZ, e.g., of previously described interconnects and/or vias. Preferably,
pyrochlore powders and/or one or more of the other nonionic phases replace YSZ
sufficiently to render the balance of the YSZ to be below a percolation threshold to
eliminate ionic conductivity across the interconnect/via. The YSZ volume fraction of the
via is purposely reduced to less than 30v% to minimize any ionic conductivity within the
via material.
          In one form, the composition of the interconnect and/or via(s), e.g., one or more
of the previously mentioned compositions for the interconnect and/or via(s), is altered to
include a reactant phase to form non-ionic conducting ceramic phases during firing of
the fuel cell, e.g., by the inclusion of rare earth oxides in the compound used to form the
interconnect/via(s).
          For example, in some embodiments, all or portions interconnect 16 or other
interconnects or vias may include a reactant phase in the form of rare earth oxide, e.g.,
within the screen printing ink, at less than the stoichiometric ratio to form pyrochlore
being one mole of the oxides of La, Pr, Nd, Gd, Sm, Ho, Er, Yb to two moles of the
zirconia content of the via. In the overall cermet composition (e.g., cermet compositions
                                             Page 53
9690324 1

for all or part of interconnect 16 set forth herein) which reacts with the YSZ during firing
of the fuel cell to form pyrochlore within the interconnect/via and adjacent to the
electrolyte, e.g., electrolyte 26. In one form, the minimum rare earth oxide required is
about 13mole% ceramic composition in order to reduce YSZ phase below 30v%
percolation. In other embodiments, other rare earth oxide amounts may be employed.
The zirconia phase may still be able to exist at greater than the percolation threshold,
since the insulating pyrochlore phase could form along grain boundaries. However, in
some embodiments, it would be preferable to add sufficient rare earth oxides to take the
YSZ phase content to below the percolation threshold on a bulk composition basis.
Similar to the pyrochlores, SrZrO 3 nonionic phases could be created in-situ through
addition of SrO powder as a reactant phase, e.g., to the interconnect inks, at less than
the stoichimetric ratio of 1 mole SrO to 1 mole ZrO 2.
          In still other embodiments, all or portions interconnect 16 or other interconnects
or vias may include a content of rare earth oxide, e.g., within the screen printing ink, at
greater than the stoichiometric ratio of pyrochlore being one mole of the oxides, e.g., of
La, Pr, Nd, Gd, Sm, Ho, Er, and/or Yb, to two moles of the zirconia content of the via in
the overall cermet composition (e.g., cermet compositions for all or part of interconnect
16 set forth herein) which reacts with the YSZ during firing of the fuel cell to form
pyrochlore within the interconnect/via, and the unreacted rare earth oxide will further
react with the extended electrolyte in the vicinity of the interconnect during electrolyte
firing to form a pyrochlore film on the electrolyte surface, e.g., on the surface of
electrolyte 26, which will sufficiently disrupt the pathways for oxygen ionic conductivity.
In form, the rare earth oxide amount is from 33mole% to 50mole% based on the total
                                             Page 54
9690324 1

ceramic phase. In other embodiments, other rare earth oxide amounts may be
employed. The excess rare earth oxide may ensure the absence of ionic conductivity.
However, too much excess rare earth remaining within the interconnect/via could cause
the via to be susceptible to moisture induced damage on phase change to the rare earth
hydroxides. Hence, it is desirable in some embodiments to limit the amount of rare
earth oxides to less than 10% over the stoichiometric ratio. Similar to the pyrochlores,
SrZrO 3 nonionic phases could be created in-situ within the via and adjacent extended
electrolyte through addition of SrO powder to the interconnect inks in excess of the
stoichimetric ratio of 1 mole SrO to 1 mole ZrO 2. In one form, a lower limit is
approximately 15-20 mole% SrO based on the ceramic phase, in order to form SrZrO3
to reduce YSZ below the percolation threshold. In other embodiments, other lower
limits may apply. In one form, an upper limit is about 50-60 mole% SrO based on the
ceramic phase (SrO + ZrO2). In other embodiments, other upper limits may apply.
          In yet still other embodiments, all or portions interconnect 16 or other
interconnects or vias may include a content of rare earth oxide at the stoichiometric ratio
with YSZ to lead to full reactivity to (MRE)2Zr2O7.
          Firing temperatures for using a reactant phase to form the non-ionic conducting
ceramic phases during firing of the fuel cell may vary with the needs of the particular
application. Considerations include, for example and without limitation, the sinterability
of different materials, powder particle size, specific surface area. Other material and/or
processing parameters may also affect the selected firing temperature. For example, If
the temperature is too low, the electrolyte may have higher porosity and cause leakage.
If the temperature is too high, it may cause other issues, such as too high an anode
                                             Page 55
9690324 1

density, which may reduce electrochemical activity, or may cause substrate dimensional
changes, etc. Hence, the actual firing temperature for purposes of using one or more
reactant phases to form one or more non-ionic conducting ceramic phases may vary as
between applications. In one form, the firing temperature may be 13850 C. In some
embodiments, the firing temperature may be in the range of 1370 0 C to 1395 0 C. In other
embodiments, the firing temperature may be in the range of 1350 0 C to 1450 0 C. In still
other embodiments, the firing temperature may be outside the range of 1350 0 C to
1450 0 C. Processing steps to form the one or more non-ionic conducting ceramic
phases may include preparing a composition including the rare earth oxide, YSZ and a
precious metal, forming the interconnect/via(s), firing the composition at the desired
temperature, e.g., at a temperature or within a temperature range set forth above, and
holding the composition at the firing temperature for a desired period, e.g., in the range
of 1-5 hours. In embodiments wherein all or portions of the fuel cell are formed by
screen printing, the method may include preparing a screen printable ink that
incorporates the rare earth oxide, YSZ and the precious metal; printing the
interconnect/via(s); drying the ink; firing the printed interconnect/via(s) at the desired
temperature, e.g., at a temperature or within a temperature range set forth above; and
holding the composition at the firing temperature for a desired period, e.g., in the range
of 1-5 hours.
          In additional embodiments, other non-ionic conducting phases or reactant
phases may be employed to minimize the ionic conductivity of the interconnect.
