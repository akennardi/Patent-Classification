Cross Reference to other Applications
[0001] This application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No.
<removed-apn>, filed on 24 February 2016, the contents of which are hereby incorporated in its
entirety.
Field
[0002] Unless otherwise indicated herein, the materials described in this section are not prior art
to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.
Background
Vehicles can be configured to operate in an autonomous mode in which the vehicle navigates
through an environment with little or no input from a driver. Such autonomous vehicles can
include one or more sensors that are configured to detect information about the environment in
which the vehicle operates.
[0003] One such sensor is a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) device. A LIDAR can estimate
distance to environmental features while scanning through a scene to assemble a "point cloud"
indicative of reflective surfaces in the environment. Individual points in the point cloud can be
determined by transmitting a laser pulse and detecting a returning pulse, if any, reflected from an
object in the environment, and determining the distance to the object according to the time delay
between the transmitted pulse and the reception of the reflected pulse. A laser, or set of lasers,
can be rapidly and repeatedly scanned across a scene to provide continuous real-time information
on distances to reflective objects in the scene. Combining the measured distances and the
orientation of the laser(s) while measuring each distance allows for associating a three
dimensional position with each returning pulse. In this way, a three-dimensional map of points
indicative of locations of reflective features in the environment can be generated for the entire
scanning zone.

Summary of Invention
[0004] In one example, a vehicle is provided that includes one or more wheels positioned at a
bottom side of the vehicle. The vehicle also includes a first light detection and ranging device
(LIDAR) positioned at a top side of the vehicle opposite to the bottom side. The first LIDAR is
configured to scan an environment around the vehicle based on rotation of the first LIDAR about
an axis. The first LIDAR has a first resolution. The vehicle also includes a second LIDAR

of the environment that extends away from the vehicle along a viewing direction of a second
LIDAR based on the second LIDAR. The second LIDAR has a second resolution. The method
further involves the vehicle operating based on the scans of the environment by the first LIDAR
and the second LIDAR.
[0006] In yet another example, a vehicle is provided that includes four wheels positioned at a

                                                   3
[0007] In still another example, a system is provided that includes means for scanning an
environment around a vehicle based on a first light detection and ranging device (LIDAR)

wheels of the vehicle are positioned at a bottom side of the vehicle opposite to the top side. The
first LIDAR has a first resolution. The system also comprises means for scanning a field-of
view (FOV) of the environment that extends away from the vehicle along a viewing direction of
a second LIDAR based on the second LIDAR. The second LIDAR has a second resolution. The
system also comprises means for the vehicle operating based on the scans of the environment by
the first LIDAR and the second LIDAR.

Description of Embodiments
[0027] The following detailed description describes various features and functions of the
disclosed systems, devices and methods with reference to the accompanying figures. In the
figures, similar symbols identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The
illustrative system, device and method embodiments described herein are not meant to be
limiting. It may be readily understood by those skilled in the art that certain aspects of the

                                                  5
disclosed systems, devices and methods can be arranged and combined in a wide variety of
different configurations, all of which are contemplated herein.
[0028] There are continued efforts to improve vehicle safety and/or autonomous operation,
including the development of vehicles equipped with accident-avoidance systems and remote
sensing capabilities. Various sensors, such as a light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor
among other possibilities, may be included in a vehicle to detect obstacles or objects in an
environment of the vehicle and thereby facilitate accident avoidance and/or autonomous
operation.
[0029] In some instances, a mounting position and/or configuration of a LIDAR may be
undesirable for some object detection/identification scenarios. In one instance, a LIDAR
positioned at a front side of a vehicle may be unable to scan the environment for objects behind
the vehicle. In another instance, a LIDAR positioned at a top side of the vehicle may have a
360-degree field-of-view (e.g., by rotating the LIDAR), but may not detect objects near the
vehicle due to the geometry of the LIDAR position at the top side of the vehicle. In yet another
instance, a LIDAR that is scanning a wide field-of-view (FOV) for a scanning duration may
provide a lower angular resolution 3D map of the environment than a similar LIDAR that is
scanning a narrower FOV over the same scanning duration. The lower resolution, for example,
may be sufficient for identifying medium range objects (e.g., within a threshold distance to the
vehicle), but may be insufficient to identify long range objects (e.g., outside the threshold
distance). Further, adjusting the scanning duration may affect a refresh rate of the LIDAR (i.e.,
rate at which the LIDAR scans the entire FOV). On one hand, a high refresh rate may allow the
LIDAR to quickly detect changes in the FOV (e.g., moving objects, etc.). On the other hand, a
low refresh rate may allow the LIDAR to provide higher resolution data.
[0030] However, a combination of the LIDAR functionalities described above can be beneficial
for effective accident avoidance and/or autonomous operation.
[0031] Within examples herein, a vehicle is provided that includes multiple light detection and
ranging devices (LIDARs) arranged and configured to facilitate scanning an environment around
the vehicle according to various road conditions and scenarios.

                                                      6
[0032] The vehicle may include a first LIDAR positioned at a top side of the vehicle and
configured to scan the environment around the vehicle based on rotation of the first LIDAR
about an axis. In some examples, the vehicle may utilize the first LIDAR to scan the
surrounding environment in all directions with a high refresh rate. For example, the axis of
rotation may be substantially vertical such that the first LIDAR has a 360-degree FOV
horizontally due to the rotation. Further, the high refresh rate may allow the vehicle to detect
moving objects (e.g., other cars, etc.) quickly. On the other hand, the high refresh rate and the
wide 360-degree FOV may reduce the angular resolution of the first LIDAR and, in turn, the
range of distances to objects that can be properly detected and/or identified by the first LIDAR.
Thus, for example, the first LIDAR may be suitable for object detection and identification within
a medium range of distances (e.g., 100 meters or less, etc.). Other resolutions, ranges, and/or
configurations of the first LIDAR are possible as well according to various applications of the
first LIDAR. For example, the "medium" range of distances may be more or less than 100
meters depending on a type of the vehicle (e.g., car, boat, plane, etc.) or any other factor.
[0033] Additionally, the vehicle may include a second LIDAR configured to scan a particular
FOV of the environment that extends away from the vehicle along a viewing direction of the
second LIDAR. The particular FOV of the second LIDAR is narrower (horizontally) than the
360-degree FOV of the first LIDAR. Additionally or alternatively, in some examples, the
second LIDAR may have a lower refresh rate than the refresh rate of the first LIDAR. In turn,
for example, the narrower FOV and/or the lower refresh rate may allow the second LIDAR to
have a higher resolution than the first LIDAR. Thus, in some examples, the second LIDAR may
be suitable for detection and/or identification of objects within a long range of distances (e.g.,
greater than the medium range of the first LIDAR). Further, in some examples, the higher
resolution data from the second LIDAR may be suitable for identification of smaller objects
(e.g., debris, etc.) that are difficult to identify using the lower resolution data from the first
LIDAR, even within the medium range of the first LIDAR. By way of example, the vehicle may
detect a small object using data from the first LIDAR, adjust the viewing direction (e.g., using a
motor, etc.) of the second LIDAR to correspond to a FOV of the environment that includes the
detected small object, and thereby identify the small object using higher resolution data from the
second LIDAR. In this example, the second LIDAR may be positioned adjacent to the first
LIDAR at the top side of the vehicle. However, other positions, resolutions, ranges and/or

                                                    7
configurations of the second LIDAR are possible as well and are described in greater detail
within exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.
[0034] In some examples, the vehicle may include a third LIDAR positioned at a given side of
the vehicle other than the top side. For example, the third LIDAR may be mounted to a front
side (e.g., bumper, hood, etc.), back side (e.g., trunk, etc.), or any other side (e.g., driver side,
passenger side, etc.). In these examples, the third LIDAR may scan a given FOV of the
environment extending away from the given side. By way of example, the first LIDAR and/or
the second LIDAR may be unable to detect objects that are very close to the vehicle due to the
position of the first LIDAR and/or second LIDAR at the top side of the vehicle. In turn, for
example, the third LIDAR may allow detection and/or identification of such objects. Further, in
some examples, the third LIDAR may have a resolution that is suitable for detection and/or
identification of such objects within a short range of distances to the vehicle.
[0035] In some examples, the various positions and configurations of the multiple LIDARs may
facilitate autonomous operation of the vehicle. By way of example, the vehicle may track
moving objects in the environment using the combination of LIDARs. In one scenario, if a car
in the environment is changing lanes, the vehicle may utilize the first LIDAR to quickly detect
motion of the car, and the second LIDAR to resolve the position of the car relative to lane lines.
In another scenario, if a motorcycle moves within a close distance to the vehicle, the vehicle may
utilize the third LIDAR to track the motorcycle. In the scenarios, the vehicle may adjust its
navigational path accordingly (e.g., speed, direction, etc.) to facilitate accidence avoidance.
[0036] Some embodiments of the present disclosure therefore provide systems and methods for a
vehicle that includes multiple LIDARs. In some examples, each LIDAR may have a
configuration (e.g., resolution, FOV, etc.) and/or position that is particularly suitable for one or
more road conditions or scenarios. Thus, in some examples, the vehicle may utilize the
combination of the multiple LIDARs to facilitate operation of the vehicle in an autonomous
mode.
[0037] The embodiments disclosed herein may be used on any type of vehicle, including
conventional automobiles and automobiles having an autonomous mode of operation. However,
the term "vehicle" is to be broadly construed to cover any moving object, including, for instance,
a truck, a van, a semi-trailer truck, a motorcycle, a golf cart, an off-road vehicle, a warehouse

                                                   8
transport vehicle, or a farm vehicle, as well as a carrier that rides on a track such as a
rollercoaster, trolley, tram, or train car, among other examples.
[0038] Referring now to the Figures, Figure 1A illustrates a vehicle 100, according to an
example embodiment. In particular, Figure 1A shows a Right Side View, Front View, Back
View, and Top View of the vehicle 100. Although vehicle 100 is illustrated in Figure 1A as a
car, as discussed above, other embodiments are possible. Furthermore, although the example
vehicle 100 is shown as a vehicle that may be configured to operate in autonomous mode, the
embodiments described herein are also applicable to vehicles that are not configured to operate
autonomously. Thus, the example vehicle 100 is not meant to be limiting. As shown, the
vehicle 100 includes five sensor units 102, 104, 106, 108, and 110, and four wheels, exemplified
by wheel 112.
[0039] In line with the discussion above, each of the sensor units 102-110 may include one or
more light detection and ranging devices (LIDARs) that have particular configuration properties
to allow scanning an environment around the vehicle 100 according to various road conditions or
scenarios. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the sensor units 102-110 may
include any combination of global positioning system sensors, inertial measurement units, radio
detection and ranging (RADAR) units, cameras, laser rangefinders, LIDARs, and/or acoustic
sensors among other possibilities.
[0040] As shown, the sensor unit 102 is mounted to a top side of the vehicle 100 opposite to a
bottom side of the vehicle 100 where the wheel 112 is mounted. Further, the sensor units 104
110 are each mounted to a given side of the vehicle 100 other than the top side. For example, the
sensor unit 104 is positioned at a front side of the vehicle 100, the sensor 106 is positioned at a
back side of the vehicle 100, the sensor unit 108 is positioned at a right side of the vehicle 100,
and the sensor unit 110 is positioned at a left side of the vehicle 100.
[0041] While the sensor units 102-110 are shown to be mounted in particular locations on the
vehicle 100, in some embodiments, the sensor units 102-110 may be mounted elsewhere on the
vehicle 100, either inside or outside the vehicle 100. For example, although Figure 1A shows the
sensor unit 108 mounted to a rear-view mirror of the vehicle 100, the sensor unit 108 may
alternatively be positioned in another location along the right side of the vehicle 100. Further,
while five sensor units are shown, in some embodiments more or fewer sensor units may be

                                                  9
included in the vehicle 100. However, for the sake of example, the sensor units 102-110 are
positioned as shown in Figure 1A.
[0042] In some embodiments, one or more of the sensor units 102-110 may include one or more
movable mounts on which the sensors may be movably mounted. The movable mount may
include, for example, a rotating platform. Sensors mounted on the rotating platform could be
rotated so that the sensors may obtain information from various directions around the vehicle
100. For example, a LIDAR of the sensor unit 102 may have a viewing direction that can be
adjusted by actuating the rotating platform to a different direction, etc. Alternatively or
additionally, the movable mount may include a tilting platform. Sensors mounted on the tilting
platform could be tilted within a given range of angles and/or azimuths so that the sensors may
obtain information from a variety of angles. The movable mount may take other forms as well.
[0043] Further, in some embodiments, one or more of the sensor units 102-110 may include one
or more actuators configured to adjust the position and/or orientation of sensors in the sensor unit
by moving the sensors and/or movable mounts. Example actuators include motors, pneumatic
actuators, hydraulic pistons, relays, solenoids, and piezoelectric actuators. Other actuators are
possible as well.
[0044] As shown, the vehicle 100 includes one or more wheels such as the wheel 112 that are
configured to rotate to cause the vehicle to travel along a driving surface. In some embodiments,
the wheel 112 may include at least one tire coupled to a rim of the wheel 112. To that end, the
wheel 112 may include any combination of metal and rubber, or a combination of other
materials. The vehicle 100 may include one or more other components in addition to or instead
of those shown.
[0045] Figure lB is a perspective view of the sensor unit 102 positioned at the top side of the
vehicle 100 shown in Figure 1A. As shown, the sensor unit 102 includes a first LIDAR 120, a
second LIDAR 122, a dividing structure 124, and light filter 126.
[0046] In some examples, the first LIDAR 120 may be configured to scan an environment
around the vehicle 100 by rotating about an axis (e.g., vertical axis, etc.) continuously while
emitting one or more light pulses and detecting reflected light pulses off objects in the
environment of the vehicle, for example. In some embodiments, the first LIDAR 120 may be

                                                   10
configured to repeatedly rotate about the axis to be able to scan the environment at a sufficiently
high refresh rate to quickly detect motion of objects in the environment. For instance, the first
LIDAR 120 may have a refresh rate of 10 Hz (e.g., ten complete rotations of the first LIDAR
120 per second), thereby scanning a 360-degree FOV around the vehicle ten times every second.
Through this process, for instance, a 3D map of the surrounding environment may be determined
based on data from the first LIDAR 120. In one embodiment, the first LIDAR 120 may include
a plurality of light sources that emit 64 laser beams having a wavelength of 905 nm. In this
embodiment, the 3D map determined based on the data from the first LIDAR 120 may have a
0.20 (horizontal) x 0.30 (vertical) angular resolution, and the first LIDAR 120 may have a 3600
(horizontal) x 200 (vertical) FOV of the environment. In this embodiment, the 3D map may have
sufficient resolution to detect or identify objects within a medium range of 100 meters from the
vehicle 100, for example. However, other configurations (e.g., number of light sources, angular
resolution, wavelength, range, etc.) are possible as well.
[0047] Unlike the first LIDAR 120, in some embodiments, the second LIDAR 122 may be
configured to scan a narrower FOV of the environment around the vehicle 100. For instance, the
second LIDAR 122 may be configured to rotate (horizontally) for less than a complete rotation
about a similar axis. Further, in some examples, the second LIDAR 122 may have a lower
refresh rate than the first LIDAR 120. Through this process, the vehicle 100 may determine a
3D map of the narrower FOV of the environment using the data from the second LIDAR 122.
The 3D map in this case may have a higher angular resolution than the corresponding 3D map
determined based on the data from the first LIDAR 120, and may thus allow
detection/identification of objects that are further than the medium range of distances of the first
LIDAR 120, as well as identification of smaller objects within the medium range of distances.
In one embodiment, the second LIDAR 122 may have a FOV of 80 (horizontal) x 150 (vertical),
a refresh rate of 4 Hz, and may emit one narrow beam having a wavelength of 1550 nm. In this
embodiment, the 3D map determined based on the data from the second LIDAR 122 may have
an angular resolution of 0.10 (horizontal) x 0.030 (vertical), thereby allowing
detection/identification of objects within a long range of 300 meters to the vehicle 100.
However, other configurations (e.g., number of light sources, angular resolution, wavelength,
range, etc.) are possible as well.

                                                   11
[0048] In some examples, the vehicle 100 may be configured to adjust a viewing direction of the
second LIDAR 122. For example, while the second LIDAR 122 has a narrow horizontal FOV
(e.g., 8 degrees), the second LIDAR 122 may be mounted to a stepper motor (not shown) that
allows adjusting the viewing direction of the second LIDAR 122 to directions other than that
shown in Figure lB. Thus, in some examples, the second LIDAR 122 may be steerable to scan
the narrow FOV along any viewing direction from the vehicle 100.
[0049] The structure, operation, and functionality of the first LIDAR 120 and the second LIDAR
122 are described in greater detail within exemplary embodiments herein.
[0050] The dividing structure 124 may be formed from any solid material suitable for supporting
the first LIDAR 120 and/or optically isolating the first LIDAR 120 from the second LIDAR 122.
Example materials may include metals, plastics, foam, among other possibilities.
[0051] The light filter 126 may be formed from any material that is substantially transparent to
light having wavelengths with a wavelength range, and substantially opaque to light having
wavelengths outside the wavelength range. For example, the light filter 126 may allow light
having the first wavelength of the first LIDAR 120 (e.g., 905 nm) and the second wavelength of
the second LIDAR 122 (e.g., 1550 nm) to propagate through the light filter 126. As shown, the
light filter 126 is shaped to enclose the first LIDAR 120 and the second LIDAR 122. Thus, in
some examples, the light filter 126 may also be configured to prevent environmental damage to
the first LIDAR 120 and the second LIDAR 122, such as accumulation of dust or collision with
airborne debris among other possibilities. In some examples, the light filter 126 may be
configured to reduce visible light propagating through the light filter 126. In turn, the light filter
126 may improve an aesthetic appearance of the vehicle 100 by enclosing the first LIDAR 120
and the second LIDAR 122, while reducing visibility of the components of the sensor unit 102
from a perspective of an outside observer, for example. In other examples, the light filter 126
may be configured to allow visible light as well as the light from the first LIDAR 120 and the
second LIDAR 122.
[0052] In some embodiments, portions of the light filter 126 may be configured to allow
different wavelength ranges to propagate through the light filter 126. For example, an upper
portion of the light filter 126 above the dividing structure 124 may be configured to allow
propagation of light within a first wavelength range that includes the first wavelength of the first

                                                  12
LIDAR 120. Further, for example, a lower portion of the light filter 126 below the dividing
structure 124 may be configured to allow propagation of light within a second wavelength range
that includes the second wavelength of the second LIDAR 122. In other embodiments, the
wavelength range associated with the light filter 126 may include both the first wavelength of the
first LIDAR 120 and the second wavelength of the second LIDAR 122.
[0053] In one embodiment, as shown, the light filter 126 having a dome shape, and may
therefore be configured as a dome-shaped housing for the first LIDAR 120 and the second
LIDAR 122. For instance, the dome-shaped housing (e.g., light filter 126) may include the
dividing structure 124 that is positioned between the first LIDAR 120 and the second LIDAR
122. Thus, in this embodiment, the first LIDAR 120 may be disposed within the dome-shaped
housing. Further, in this embodiment, the second LIDAR 122 may also be disposed within the
dome-shaped housing and may be positioned between the first LIDAR 120 and the top side of
the vehicle 100 as shown in Figure 1B.
[0054] Figure IC is a perspective view of the sensor unit 104 positioned at the front side of the
vehicle 100 shown in Figure 1A. In some examples, the sensor units 106, 108, and 110 may be
configured similarly to the sensor unit 104 illustrated in Figure IC. As shown, the sensor unit
104 includes a third LIDAR 130 and a light filter 132.
[0055] The third LIDAR 130 may be configured to scan a FOV of the environment around the
vehicle 100 that extends away from a given side of the vehicle 100 (i.e., the front side) where the
third LIDAR 130 is positioned. Thus, in some examples, the third LIDAR 130 may be
configured to rotate (e.g., horizontally) across a wider FOV than the second LIDAR 122 but less
than the 360-degree FOV of the first LIDAR 120 due to the positioning of the third LIDAR 130.
In one embodiment, the third LIDAR 130 may have a FOV of 270' (horizontal) x 1100
(vertical), a refresh rate of 4 Hz, and may emit one laser beam having a wavelength of 905nm.
In this embodiment, the 3D map determined based on the data from the third LIDAR 130 may
have an angular resolution of 1.20 (horizontal) x 0.2' (vertical), thereby allowing
detection/identification of objects within a short range of 30 meters to the vehicle 100. However,
other configurations (e.g., number of light sources, angular resolution, wavelength, range, etc.)
are possible as well. The structure, operation, and functionality of the third LIDAR 130 are
described in greater detail within exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.

                                                   13
[0056] The light filter 132 may be similar to the light filter 126 of Figure 1B. For example, the
light filter 132 may be shaped to enclose the third LIDAR 130. Further, for example, the light
filter 132 may be configured to allow light within a wavelength range that includes the
wavelength of light from the third LIDAR 130 to propagate through the light filter 132. In some
examples, the light filter 132 may be configured to reduce visible light propagating through the
light filter 132, thereby improving an aesthetic appearance of the vehicle 100.
[0057] Figures ID-1E illustrate the vehicle 100 shown in Figure 1A scanning a surrounding
environment, according to an example embodiment.
[0058] Figure ID illustrates a scenario where the vehicle 100 is operating on a surface 140. The
surface 140, for example, may be a driving surface such as a road or a highway, or any other
surface. In Figure ID, the arrows 142, 144, 146, 148, 150, 152 illustrate light pulses emitted by
various LIDARs of the sensor units 102 and 104 at ends of the vertical FOV of the respective
LIDAR.
[0059] By way of example, arrows 142 and 144 illustrate light pulses emitted by the first LIDAR
120 of Figure lB. In this example, the first LIDAR 120 may emit a series of pulses in the region
of the environment between the arrows 142 and 144 and may receive reflected light pulses from
that region to detect and/or identify objects in that region. Due to the positioning of the first
LIDAR 120 (not shown) of the sensor unit 102 at the top side of the vehicle 100, the vertical
FOV of the first LIDAR 120 is limited by the structure of the vehicle 100 (e.g., roof, etc.) as
illustrated in Figure ID. However, the positioning of the first LIDAR 120 in the sensor unit 102
at the top side of the vehicle 100 allows the first LIDAR 120 to scan all directions around the
vehicle 100 by rotating about a substantially vertical axis 170. Similarly, for example, the
arrows 146 and 148 illustrate light pulses emitted by the second LIDAR 122 of Figure lB at the
ends of the vertical FOV of the second LIDAR 122. Further, the second LIDAR 122 may also
be steerable to adjust a viewing direction of the second LIDAR 122 to any direction around the
vehicle 100 in line with the discussion. In one embodiment, the vertical FOV of the first LIDAR
120 (e.g., angle between arrows 142 and 144) is 200 and the vertical FOV of the second LIDAR
122 is 15' (e.g., angle between arrows 146 and 148). However, other vertical FOVs are possible
as well depending, for example, on factors such as structure of the vehicle 100 or configuration
of the respective LIDARs.

                                                   14
[0060] As shown in Figure ID, the sensor unit 102 (including the first LIDAR 120 and/or the
second LIDAR 122) may scan for objects in the environment of the vehicle 100 in any direction
around the vehicle 100 (e.g., by rotating, etc.), but may be less suitable for scanning the
environment for objects in close proximity to the vehicle 100. For example, as shown, objects
within distance 154 to the vehicle 100 may be undetected or may only be partially detected by
the first LIDAR 120 of the sensor unit 102 due to positions of such objects being outside the
region between the light pulses illustrated by the arrows 142 and 144. Similarly, objects within
distance 156 may also be undetected or may only be partially detected by the second LIDAR 122
of the sensor unit 102.
[0061] Accordingly, the third LIDAR 130 (not shown) of the sensor unit 104 may be used for
scanning the environment for objects that are close to the vehicle 100. For example, due to the
positioning of the sensor unit 104 at the front side of the vehicle 100, the third LIDAR 130 may
be suitable for scanning the environment for objects within the distance 154 and/or the distance
156 to the vehicle 100, at least for the portion of the environment extending away from the front
side of the vehicle 100. As shown, for example, the arrows 150 and 152 illustrate light pulses
emitted by the third LIDAR 130 at ends of the vertical FOV of the third LIDAR 130. Thus, for
example, the third LIDAR 130 of the sensor unit 104 may be configured to scan a portion of the
environment between the arrows 150 and 152, including objects that are close to the vehicle 100.
In one embodiment, the vertical FOV of the third LIDAR 130 is 1100 (e.g., angle between
arrows 150 and 152). However, other vertical FOVs are possible as well.
[0062] It is noted that the angles between the various arrows 142-152 shown in Figure ID are
not to scale and are for illustrative purposes only. Thus, in some examples, the vertical FOVs of
the various LIDARs may vary as well.
[0063] Figure 1E illustrates a top view of the vehicle 100 in a scenario where the vehicle 100 is
scanning a surrounding environment. In line with the discussion above, each of the various
LIDARs of the vehicle 100 may have a particular resolution according to its respective refresh
rate, FOV, or any other factor. In turn, the various LIDARs may be suitable for detection and/or
identification of objects within a respective range of distances to the vehicle 100.
[0064] As shown in Figure 1E, contours 160 and 162 illustrate an example range of distances to
the vehicle 100 where objects may be detected/identified based on data from the first LIDAR

                                                  15
120 of the sensor unit 102. As illustrated, for example, close objects within the contour 160 may
not be properly detected and/or identified due to the positioning of the sensor unit 102 on the top
side of the vehicle 100. However, for example, objects outside of contour 160 and within a
medium range of distances (e.g., 100 meters, etc.) defined by the contour 162 may be properly
detected/identified using the data from the first LIDAR 120. Further, as shown, the horizontal
FOV of the first LIDAR 120 may span 3600 in all directions around the vehicle 100.
[0065] Further, as shown in Figure 1E, contour 164 illustrates a region of the environment where
objects may be detected and/or identified using the higher resolution data from the second
LIDAR 122 of the sensor unit 102. As shown, the contour 164 includes objects further away
from the vehicle 100 within a long range of distances (e.g., 300 meters, etc.), for example.
Although the contour 164 indicates a narrower FOV (horizontally) of the second LIDAR 122, in
some examples, the vehicle 100 may be configured to adjust the viewing direction of the second
LIDAR 122 to any other direction than that shown in Figure 1E. By way of example, the vehicle
100 may detect an object using the data from the first LIDAR 120 (e.g., within the contour 162),
adjust the viewing direction of the second LIDAR 122 to a FOV that includes the object, and
then identify the object using the higher resolution data from the second LIDAR 122. In one
embodiment, the horizontal FOV of the second LIDAR 122 may be 8'.
[0066] Further, as shown in Figure 1E, contour 166 illustrates a region of the environment
scanned by the third LIDAR 130 of the sensor unit 104. As shown, the region illustrated by the
contour 166 includes portions of the environment that may not be scanned by the first LIDAR
120 and/or the second LIDAR 124, for example. Further, for example, the data from the third
LIDAR 130 has a resolution sufficient to detect and/or identify objects within a short distance
(e.g., 30 meters, etc.) to the vehicle 100.
[0067] It is noted that the ranges, resolutions, and FOVs described above are for exemplary
purposes only, and may vary according to various configurations of the vehicle 100. Further, the
contours 160-166 shown in Figure 1E are not to scale but are illustrated as shown for
convenience of description.
[0068] Figure 2A illustrates a first LIDAR 200, according to an example embodiment. In some
examples, the first LIDAR 200 may be similar to the first LIDAR 120 of Figure IB, the second
LIDAR 122 of Figure IB, the third LIDAR 130 of Figure IC, and/or any other LIDAR device

                                                 16
mounted to a vehicle such as the vehicle 100. For example, the first LIDAR 200 may be
mounted at a top side of a vehicle such as the vehicle 100 similarly to the first LIDAR 120 of the
Figure 1B. As shown, the LIDAR device 200 includes a housing 210 and a lens 250.
Additionally, light beams 204 emitted by the first LIDAR device 200 propagate from the lens
250 along a viewing direction of the first LIDAR 200 toward an environment of the LIDAR
device 200, and reflect off one or more objects in the environment as reflected light 206.
[0069] The housing 210 included in the LIDAR device 200 can provide a platform for mounting
the various components included in the LIDAR device 200. The housing 210 can be formed
from any material capable of supporting the various components of the LIDAR device 200
included in an interior space of the housing 210. For example, the housing 210 may be formed
from a solid material such as plastic or metal among other possibilities.
[0070] In some examples, the housing 210 can be configured to have a substantially cylindrical
shape and to rotate about an axis of the LIDAR device 200. For example, the housing 210 can
have the substantially cylindrical shape with a diameter of approximately 10 centimeters. In
some examples, the axis is substantially vertical. By rotating the housing 210 that includes the
various components, in some examples, a three-dimensional map of a 360-degree view of the
environment of the LIDAR device 200 can be determined without frequent recalibration of the
arrangement of the various components of the LIDAR device 200. Additionally or alternatively,
in some examples, the LIDAR device 200 can be configured to tilt the axis of rotation of the
housing 210 to control the field of view of the LIDAR device 200.
[0071] The lens 250 mounted to the housing 210 can have an optical power to both collimate the
emitted light beams 204, and focus the reflected light 205 from one or more objects in the
environment of the LIDAR device 200 onto detectors in the LIDAR device 200. In one
example, the lens 250 has a focal length of approximately 120 mm. By using the same lens 250
to perform both of these functions, instead of a transmit lens for collimating and a receive lens
for focusing, advantages with respect to size, cost, and/or complexity can be provided.
[0072] The LIDAR device 200 can be mounted on a mounting structure 260 that rotates about an
axis to provide a 360-degree view of the environment surrounding the LIDAR device 200. In
some examples, the mounting structure 260 may comprise a movable platform that may tilt in
one or more directions to change the axis of rotation of the LIDAR device 200.

                                                   17
[0073] Figure 2B is a cross-section view of the first LIDAR 200 shown in Figure 2A. As shown,
the housing 210 houses a transmit block 220, a receive block 230, a shared space 240, and the
lens 250. For purposes of illustration, Figure 2B shows an x-y-z axis, in which the z-axis is in a
substantially vertical direction.
[0074] The transmit block 220 includes a plurality of light sources 222a-c arranged along a
curved focal surface 228 defined by the lens 250. The plurality of light sources 222a-c can be
configured to emit, respectively, the plurality of light beams 202a-c having wavelengths within a
wavelength range. For example, the plurality of light sources 222a-c may comprise laser diodes
that emit the plurality of light beams 202a-c having the wavelengths within the wavelength
range. The plurality of light beams 202a-c are reflected by mirror 224 through an exit aperture
226 into the shared space 240 and towards the lens 250.
[0075] The light sources 222a-c can include laser diodes, light emitting diodes (LED), vertical
cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL), organic light emitting diodes (OLED), polymer light
emitting diodes (PLED), light emitting polymers (LEP), liquid crystal displays (LCD),
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), or any other device configured to selectively
transmit, reflect, and/or emit light to provide the plurality of emitted light beams 202a-c. In
some examples, the light sources 222a-c can be configured to emit the emitted light beams 202a
c in a wavelength range that can be detected by detectors 232a-c included in the receive block
230. The wavelength range could, for example, be in the ultraviolet, visible, and/or infrared
portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In some examples, the wavelength range can be a
narrow wavelength range, such as provided by lasers. In one example, the wavelength range
includes wavelengths that are approximately 905 nm. Additionally, the light sources 222a-c can
be configured to emit the emitted light beams 202a-c in the form of pulses. In some examples,
the plurality of light sources 222a-c can be disposed on one or more substrates (e.g., printed
circuit boards (PCB), flexible PCBs, etc.) and arranged to emit the plurality of light beams 202a
c towards the exit aperture 226.
[0076] Although Figure 2B shows that the curved focal surface 228 is curved in the x-y plane,
additionally or alternatively, the plurality of light sources 222a-c may be arranged along a focal
surface that is curved in a vertical plane. For example, the curved focal surface 228 can have a
curvature in a vertical plane, and the plurality of light sources 222a-c can include additional light
sources arranged vertically along the curved focal surface 228 and configured to emit light

                                                  18
beams directed at the mirror 224 and reflected through the exit aperture 226. In this example, the
detectors 232a-c may also include additional detectors that correspond to additional light sources
of the light sources 222a-c. Further, in some examples, the light sources 222a-c may include
additional light sources arranged horizontally along the curved focal surface 228. In one
embodiment, the light sources 222a-c may include 64 light sources that emit light having a
wavelength of 905 nm. For instance, the 64 light sources may be arranged in four columns, each
comprising 16 light sources, along the curved focal surface 228. In this instance, the detectors
232a-c may include 64 detectors that are arranged similarly (e.g., 4 columns comprising 16
detectors each, etc.) along curved focal surface 238. In other embodiments, the light sources
222a-c and the detectors 232a-c may include more or less light sources and/or detectors than
those shown in Figure 2B.
[0077] Due to the arrangement of the plurality of light sources 222a-c along the curved focal
surface 228, the plurality of light beams 202a-c, in some examples, may converge towards the
exit aperture 226. Thus, in these examples, the exit aperture 226 may be minimally sized while
being capable of accommodating vertical and horizontal extents of the plurality of light beams
202a-c. Additionally, in some examples, the curved focal surface 228 can be defined by the lens
250. For example, the curved focal surface 228 may correspond to a focal surface of the lens
250 due to shape and composition of the lens 250. In this example, the plurality of light sources
222a-c can be arranged along the focal surface defined by the lens 250 at the transmit block.
[0078] The plurality of light beams 202a-c propagate in a transmit path that extends through the
transmit block 220, the exit aperture 226, and the shared space 240 towards the lens 250. The
lens 250 collimates the plurality of light beams 202a-c to provide collimated light beams 204a-c
into an environment of the LIDAR device 200. The collimated light beams 204a-c correspond,
respectively, to the plurality of light beams 202a-c. In some examples, the collimated light
beams 204a-c reflect off one or more objects in the environment of the LIDAR device 200 as
reflected light 206. The reflected light 206 may be focused by the lens 250 into the shared space
240 as focused light 208 traveling along a receive path that extends through the shared space 240
onto the receive block 230. For example, the focused light 208 may be reflected by the reflective
surface 242 as focused light 208a-c propagating towards the receive block 230.
[0079] The lens 250 may be capable of both collimating the plurality of light beams 202a-c and
focusing the reflected light 206 along the receive path 208 towards the receive block 230 due to

                                                   19
shape and composition of the lens 250. For example, the lens 250 can have an aspheric surface
252 facing outside of the housing 210 and a toroidal surface 254 facing the shared space 240. By
using the same lens 250 to perform both of these functions, instead of a transmit lens for
collimating and a receive lens for focusing, advantages with respect to size, cost, and/or
complexity can be provided.
[0080] The exit aperture 226 is included in a wall 244 that separates the transmit block 220 from
the shared space 240. In some examples, the wall 244 can be formed from a transparent material
(e.g., glass) that is coated with a reflective material 242. In this example, the exit aperture 226
may correspond to the portion of the wall 244 that is not coated by the reflective material 242.
Additionally or alternatively, the exit aperture 226 may comprise a hole or cut-away in the wall
244.
[0081] The focused light 208 is reflected by the reflective surface 242 and directed towards an
entrance aperture 234 of the receive block 230. In some examples, the entrance aperture 234
may comprise a filtering window configured to allow wavelengths in the wavelength range of
the plurality of light beams 202a-c emitted by the plurality of light sources 222a-c and attenuate
other wavelengths. The focused light 208a-c reflected by the reflective surface 242 from the
focused light 208 propagates, respectively, onto a plurality of detectors 232a-c.
[0082] The plurality of detectors 232a-c can be arranged along a curved focal surface 238 of the
receive block 230. Although Figure 2 shows that the curved focal surface 238 is curved along
the x-y plane (horizontal plane), additionally or alternatively, the curved focal surface 238 can be
curved in a vertical plane. The curvature of the focal surface 238 is also defined by the lens 250.
For example, the curved focal surface 238 may correspond to a focal surface of the light
projected by the lens 250 along the receive path at the receive block 230.
[0083] The detectors 232a-c may comprise photodiodes, avalanche photodiodes,
phototransistors, cameras, active pixel sensors (APS), charge coupled devices (CCD), cryogenic
detectors, or any other sensor of light configured to receive focused light 208a-c having
wavelengths in the wavelength range of the emitted light beams 202a-c.
[0084] Each of the focused light 208a-c corresponds, respectively, to the emitted light beams
202a-c and is directed onto, respectively, the plurality of detectors 232a-c. For example, the

                                                  20
detector 232a is configured and arranged to received focused light 208a that corresponds to
collimated light beam 204a reflected of the one or more objects in the environment of the
LIDAR device 200. In this example, the collimated light beam 204a corresponds to the light
beam 202a emitted by the light source 222a. Thus, the detector 232a receives light that was
emitted by the light source 222a, the detector 232b receives light that was emitted by the light
source 222b, and the detector 232c receives light that was emitted by the light source 222c.
[0085] By comparing the received light 208a-c with the emitted light beams 202a-c, at least one
aspect of the one or more object in the environment of the LIDAR device 200 may be
determined. For example, by comparing a time when the plurality of light beams 202a-c were
emitted by the plurality of light sources 222a-c and a time when the plurality of detectors 232a-c
received the focused light 208a-c, a distance between the LIDAR device 200 and the one or more
object in the environment of the LIDAR device 200 may be determined. In some examples,
other aspects such as shape, color, material, etc. may also be determined.
[0086] In some examples, the LIDAR device 200 may be rotated about an axis to determine a
three-dimensional map of the surroundings of the LIDAR device 200. For example, the LIDAR
device 200 may be rotated about a substantially vertical axis as illustrated by arrow 290.
Although illustrated that the LIDAR device 200 is rotated counter clock-wise about the axis as
illustrated by the arrow 290, additionally or alternatively, the LIDAR device 200 may be rotated
in the clockwise direction. In some examples, the LIDAR device 200 may be rotated 360
degrees about the axis, similarly to the first LIDAR 120 of Figure lB. In other examples, the
LIDAR device 200 may be rotated back and forth along a portion of the 360 degree view of the
LIDAR device 200, similarly to the second LIDAR 122 of Figure 1B. For example, the LIDAR
device 200 may be mounted on a platform that wobbles back and forth about the axis without
making a complete rotation.
[0087] Thus, the arrangement of the light sources 222a-c and the detectors 232a-c may allow the
LIDAR device 200 to have a particular vertical field-of-view. In one example, the vertical FOV
of the LIDAR device 200 is 200. Additionally, the rotation of the LIDAR device 200 allows the
LIDAR device 200 to have a 360' horizontal FOV. Further, the rate of rotation may allow the
device to have a particular refresh rate. In one example, the refresh rate is 10 Hz. The refresh
rate along with the arrangement of the light sources 222a-c and the detectors 232a-c may also
allow the LIDAR device 300 to have a particular angular resolution. In one example, the angular

                                                 21
resolution is 0.20 x 0.3'. However, the various parameters such as the refresh rate and the
angular resolution may vary according to the configuration of the LIDAR device 200. Further,
in some examples, the LIDAR device 200 may include additional or fewer components than
those shown in Figures 2A-2B.
[0088] Figure 2C illustrates a three-dimensional (3D) representation 292 of an environment
based on data from the first LIDAR 200 of Figure 2A, according to an example embodiment. In
some examples, the 3D representation 292 may be generated by a computing device as a 3D
point cloud based on the data from the first LIDAR 200. Each point of the 3D cloud, for
example, may be associated with a reflected light pulse from the reflected light beams 206
shown in Figure 2B. Thus, as shown, points at a greater distance from the LIDAR 200 are
further from one another due to the angular resolution of the LIDAR 200. Based on the rotation
of the first LIDAR 200, the 3D representation 292 includes a scan of the environment in all
directions (360' horizontally) as shown in Figure 2C. Further, as shown, a region 294 of the 3D
representation 292 does not include any points. For example, the region 294 may correspond to
the contour 160 (Figure 1E) around the vehicle 100 that the first LIDAR 120 of Figure 1B is
unable to scan due to positioning at the top side of the vehicle 100. Further, as shown, a region
296 is indicative of objects in the environment of the LIDAR device 200. For example, the
objects in the region 296 may correspond to pedestrians, vehicles, or other obstacles in the
environment of the LIDAR device 200. In an example scenario where the LIDAR device 200 is
mounted to a vehicle such as the vehicle 100, the vehicle 100 may utilize the 3D representation
292 to navigate the vehicle away from region 296 towards region 298 that does not include the
obstacles of the region 296.
[0089] Figure 3A illustrates a second LIDAR 300, according to an example embodiment. In
some examples, the second LIDAR 300 may be similar to the first LIDAR 120 of Figure IB, the
second LIDAR 122 of Figure 1B, the third LIDAR 130 of Figure IC, and/or any other LIDAR
mounted to a vehicle such as the vehicle 100. For example, the second LIDAR 300 may be
mounted at a top side of a vehicle such as the vehicle 100 similarly to the second LIDAR 122 of
the Figure 1B. As shown, the LIDAR device 300 includes an optics assembly 310, a mirror 320,
a pin 322, and a platform/stepper motor 330. Additionally, light beams 304 emitted by the
second LIDAR device 300 propagate away from the mirror 320 along a viewing direction of the

                                                  22
second LIDAR 300 toward an environment of the LIDAR device 300, and reflect of one or more
objects in the environment as reflected light 306.
[0090] The optics assembly 310 may be configured to emit light pulses towards the mirror 320
that are then reflected by the mirror 320 as the emitted light 304. Further, the optics assembly
310 may be configured to receive reflected light 306 that is reflected off the mirror 320. In one
embodiment, the optics assembly 310 may include a single laser emitter that is configured to
provide a narrow beam having a wavelength of 1550nm. In this embodiment, the narrow beam
may have a high energy sufficient for detection of objects within a long range of distances,
similarly to the second LIDAR 122 of Figure lB. In other embodiments, the optics assembly
310 may include multiple light sources similarly to the LIDAR 200 of Figures 2A-2B. Further,
in some examples, the optics assembly 310 may include a single lens for both collimation of
emitted light 304 and focusing of reflected light 306. In other examples, the optics assembly 310
may include a first lens for collimation of emitted light 304 and a second lens for focusing of
reflected light 306.
[0091] The mirror 320 may be arranged to steer emitted light 304 from the optics assembly 310
towards the viewing direction of the LIDAR 300 as illustrated in Figure 3A. Similarly, for
example, the mirror 320 may be arranged to steer reflected light 306 from the environment
towards the optics assembly 310.
[0092] The pin 322 may be configured to mount the mirror 320 to the LIDAR device 300. In
turn, the pin 322 can be formed from any material capable of supporting the mirror 320. For
example, the pin 322 may be formed from a solid material such as plastic or metal among other
possibilities. In some examples, the LIDAR 300 may be configured to rotate the mirror 320
about the pin 322 over a given range of angles to steer the emitted light 304 vertically. In one
embodiment, the LIDAR 300 may rotate the mirror 320 about the pin 322 over the range of
angles of 150. In this embodiment, the vertical FOV of the LIDAR 300 may correspond to 15'.
However, other vertical FOVs are possible as well according to various factors such as the
mounting position of the LIDAR 300 or any other factor.
[0093] The platform 330 can be formed from any material capable of supporting various
components of the LIDAR 300 such as the optics assembly 310 and the mirror 320. For
example, the platform 330 may be formed from a solid material such as plastic or metal among

                                                  23
other possibilities. In some examples, the platform 330 may be configured to rotate about an
axis of the LIDAR device 300. For example, the platform 330 may include or may be a motor
such as a stepper motor to facilitate such rotation. In some examples, the axis is substantially
vertical. By rotating the platform 330 that supports the various components, in some examples,
the platform 330 may steer the emitted light 304 horizontally, thus allowing the LIDAR 300 to
have a horizontal FOV. In one embodiment, the platform 330 may rotate for a defined amount
of rotation such as 80. In this embodiment, the LIDAR 300 may thus have a horizontal FOV of
8', similarly to the second LIDAR 122 of Figure 1B. In another embodiment, the platform 330
may rotate for complete 360' rotation such that the horizontal FOV is 360', similarly to the first
LIDAR 120 of Figure 1B. In yet another embodiment, the platform 330 may rotate for 270',
such that the horizontal FOV is 270' similarly to the third LIDAR 130 of Figure IC. Other
configurations of the platform 330 are possible as well. Thus, in some examples, the LIDAR
300 may provide an alternative device for scanning the environment or a portion thereof to the
device of the LIDAR 200 of Figures 2A-2B.
[0094] Figure 3B illustrates a 3D representation 392 of an environment based on data from the
second LIDAR 300 of Figure 3A, according to an example embodiment. In some examples, the
3D representation 392 may be generated, similarly to the 3D representation 292 of Figure 2C, by
a computing device as a 3D point cloud based on the data from the second LIDAR 300. Each
point of the 3D cloud, for example, may be associated with a reflected light pulse from the
reflected light beams 306 shown in Figure 3A.
[0095] As shown, the 3D representation 392 includes a region 394 similar to the region 294 of
the 3D representation 292 that may be an unscanned region due to positioning of the second
LIDAR 300 at the top side of a vehicle. For example, the region 294 may correspond to the
contour 160 of Figure 1E around the vehicle 100.
[0096] Unlike the 3D representation 292 of Figure 2C, however, the 3D representation 392 spans
a much narrower field-of-view. For example, the FOV scanned by the LIDAR 300 and
illustrated in the 3D representation 392 may correspond to the contour 164 of Figure 1E. Due in
part to the narrower FOV, the 3D representation 392 has a higher resolution than the 3D
representation 292. For instance, points in the point cloud are closer to one another and thus
some objects in the environment may be easily identified compared to the objects in the
environment represented by the 3D representation 292.

                                                   24
[0097] In an example scenario, a vehicle such as the vehicle 100 may include a first LIDAR
(e.g., first LIDAR 120) similar to the first LIDAR 200 and a second LIDAR (e.g., second
LIDAR 122) similar to the second LIDAR 300. In the scenario, the vehicle may utilize data
from the first LIDAR to generate the 3D representation 292 of Figure 2C. Further, in the
scenario, the vehicle may determine that the region 296 of the 3D representation 292 as a region
of interest for further scanning. In turn, the vehicle in the scenario may adjust a viewing
direction of the second LIDAR to scan the region of interest and obtain the 3D representation
392 of Figure 3B. In the scenario, the vehicle may process the 3D representation 392 using a
computing process such as an image processing algorithm or a shape detection algorithm. In
turn, the vehicle of the scenario may identify an object in region 396 of the 3D representation
392 as a pedestrian, and another object in region 398 as a light post. In the scenario, the vehicle
may then navigate accordingly. In one instance, the vehicle may navigate to be within a first
threshold distance to the objects if the objects include a pedestrian (e.g., as indicated by region
396), or a lower second threshold distance if the objects include inanimate objects such as the
light post (e.g., indicated by region 398) among other possibilities. In another instance, the
vehicle may assign the second LIDAR to track the objects if an animate object is identified (e.g.,
region 396), or may assign the second LIDAR to track other objects if only inanimate objects
were identified. Other navigational operations are possible in line with the scenario.
[0098] Thus, in some examples, a vehicle that includes a combination of LIDARs such as the
LIDAR 200 and the LIDAR 300 may utilize the respective characteristics of each LIDAR such
as refresh rate, resolution, FOV, position, etc., to scan the environment according to various road
conditions and/or scenarios.
[0099] Figure 4A illustrates a third LIDAR 400, according to an example embodiment. In some
examples, the third LIDAR 400 may be similar to the first LIDAR 120 of Figure IB, the second
LIDAR 122 of Figure IB, the third LIDAR 130 of Figure IC, and/or any other LIDAR mounted
to a vehicle such as the vehicle 100. For example, the third LIDAR 400 may be mounted at a
front side of a vehicle similarly to the third LIDAR 130 of the Figure IC, or to any other side of
the vehicle (e.g., in sensor units 106, 108, 110, etc., of the vehicle 100). As shown, the third
LIDAR 400 includes an optics assembly 410, a transmit lens 412, a receive lens 414, a mirror
420, a pin 422, and a motor 430. For purposes of illustration, Figure 4A shows an x-y-z axis, in

                                                  25
which the z-axis is pointing out of the page, and the x-axis and y-axis define a horizontal plane
along the surface of the page.
[0100] Similarly to the second LIDAR 300, in some examples, the third LIDAR 400 may emit
light that propagates away from the mirror 420 along a viewing direction of the third LIDAR 400
(e.g., parallel to z-axis shown in Figure 4A, etc.) toward an environment of the third LIDAR 400,
and may receive reflected light from one or more objects in the environment.
[0101] Accordingly, the optics assembly 410 may be configured to emit light pulses towards the
mirror 420 that are then reflected by the mirror 420 towards the environment. Further, the optics
assembly 410 may be configured to receive reflected light that is reflected off the mirror 420. In
one embodiment, the optics assembly 310 may include a single laser emitter that is configured to
provide a narrow beam having a wavelength of 905 nm. In other embodiments, the optics
assembly 410 may include multiple light sources similarly to the LIDAR 200 of Figures 2A-2B.
As shown, the optics assembly 410 includes the transmit lens 412 for collimation and/or focusing
of emitted light from the optics assembly 410 onto the mirror 420, and a receive lens 414 for
focusing reflected light from the mirror 420 onto one or more detectors (not shown) of the optics
assembly 410. However, in some examples, the optics assembly 410 may alternatively include a
single lens for both collimation of emitted light and focusing of reflected light similarly to the
lens 250 of the first LIDAR 200.
[0102] Similarly to the mirror 320 of the second LIDAR 300, the mirror 420 of the third LIDAR
400 may be arranged to steer emitted light from the transmit lens 412 towards the viewing
direction of the LIDAR 400 as illustrated in Figure 4A. Further, for example, the mirror 420
may be arranged to steer reflected light from the mirror 420 towards the receive lens 414.
However, in some examples, unlike the mirror 320, the mirror 420 may be a triangular mirror
that performs complete rotations about an axis defined by the pin. In these examples, the mirror
420 may allow reflecting the emitted light from the optics assembly 410 over a wider vertical
FOV than the second LIDAR 300. In one embodiment, the vertical FOV of the third LIDAR
400 is 1100, similarly to the third LIDAR 130 of Figure IC.
[0103] The pin 422 may be configured to mount the mirror 420 to the LIDAR device 400. In
turn, the pin 422 can be formed from any material capable of supporting the mirror 420. For
example, the pin 422 may be formed from a solid material such as plastic or metal among other

                                                  26
possibilities. In some examples, the LIDAR 400 may be configured to rotate the mirror 420
about the pin 422 for complete rotations to steer emitted light from the optics assembly 410
vertically. However, in other examples, the LIDAR 400 may be configured to rotate the mirror
420 about the pin 422 over a given range of angles to steer the emitted light, similarly to the
LIDAR 300. Thus, in some examples, various vertical FOVs are possible by adjusting the
rotation the mirror 420 about the pin 422.
[0104] The motor 430 may include any motor such as a stepper motor, an electric motor, a
combustion motor, a pancake motor, and/or a piezoelectric actuator among other possibilities. In
some examples, the motor 430 may be configured to rotate various components of the LIDAR
400 (e.g., optics assembly 410, mirror 420, pin 422, etc.) about an axis of the LIDAR device 400.
For example, the axis may be substantially vertical similarly to the y-axis shown in Figure 4A.
By rotating the various components of the LIDAR 400 about the axis, in some examples, the
motor 430 may steer the emitted light from that is reflected off the mirror 420 horizontally, thus
allowing the LIDAR 400 to have a horizontal FOV. In one embodiment, the motor 430 may
rotate for a defined amount of rotation such as 2700. In this embodiment, the LIDAR 400 may
thus have a horizontal FOV of 270', similarly to the third LIDAR 130 of Figure IC. However,
other amounts of rotation are possible as well (e.g., 360' similarly to the first LIDAR 120, 8'
similarly to the second LIDAR 122, etc.) thereby allowing a different horizontal FOV for the
LIDAR 400. Thus, in some examples, the LIDAR 400 may provide an alternative device for
scanning the environment or a portion thereof to the device of the LIDAR 200 of Figures 2A-2B,
and/or the LIDAR 300 of Figure 3A.
[0105] Figure 4B illustrates a partial cross-section view of the third LIDAR 400 shown in Figure
4A. It is noted that some of the components of the third LIDAR 400 are omitted from the
illustration of Figure 4B for convenience in description.
[0106] As shown, the optics assembly 410 includes a light source 422. The light source 422
may be configured to emit one or more light pulses (e.g., laser beams, etc.) towards the transmit
lens 412. For example, as shown, emitted light 402a propagates away from the light source 442
towards the transmit lens 412. In some examples, the light source 422 may be similar to the light
sources 222a-c of the LIDAR 200 of Figure 2B. In one embodiment, the light source 422 may
be configured to emit light pulses having a wavelength of 905nm.

                                                  27
[0107] In line with the discussion above, the transmit lens 412 may be configured to collimate
the emitted light 402a into one or more collimated light beams 402b and/or may be configured to
focus the emitted light 402a as the focused light 402b onto the mirror 420.
[0108] In some examples, the mirror 420 may be a triangular mirror as shown that has three
reflective surfaces 420a, 420b, 420c. However, in other examples, the mirror 420 may
alternatively include more than three reflective surfaces. In the configuration shown in Figure
4B, the collimated light 402b may then reflect off the reflective surface 402a and into the
environment of the LIDAR 400 as emitted light 402c. For example, a direction of the emitted
light 402c is illustrated in Figure 4B by arrow 452. Further, as the mirror 420 is rotated about an
axis defined by the pin 422, the emitted light 402c may be steered to have a different direction
than that illustrated by arrow 452. For example, the direction 452 of the emitted light 402c may
instead correspond to a different direction along arrow 450. Thus, by rotating the mirror 420
about the pin 422, the LIDAR 400 may be configured to have a vertical FOV, for example.
[0109] Consider by way of example a scenario where the mirror 420 is configured to rotate
about an axis defined by the pin 422 continuously in a clock-wise direction. In this scenario, the
direction 452 of the emitted light 402c may thereby be adjusted also in a clock-wise direction as
illustrated by the arrow 450 until the focused light 402b is reflecting off an edge of the reflective
surface 420a. At this point, the emitted light 402c would be directed towards a maximum extent
of the vertical FOV of the LIDAR 400. Continuing with the scenario, as the mirror 420
continues to rotate, the collimated light 402b may then be focused onto the reflective surface
420b instead of the reflective surface 420a. At this point, the reflected light 402c may be
steered to a direction that is towards a minimum extent of the vertical FOV of the LIDAR 400.
Continuing with the scenario, as the mirror 420 continues to rotate, the direction of the emitted
light 402c may then be adjusted in a clock-wise direction towards the maximum extent of the
vertical FOV that corresponds to the light 402b being focused onto another edge of the reflective
surface 420b. Similarly, continuing with the scenario, the direction of the emitted light 402c
may then be adjusted to scan the vertical FOV of the LIDAR 400 by reflecting the light 402b off
the reflective surface 420c instead of the reflective surface 420b. Through this process, for
example, the LIDAR 400 may continuously scan the vertical FOV. As a variation of the
scenario above by way of example, the mirror 420 may be alternatively configured to rotate
within a given range of angles (e.g., wobble, etc.) to define a narrower vertical field-of-view than

                                                 28
that of the scenario described above. Other configurations for rotation of the mirror 420 are
possible as well.
[0110] Figure 4C illustrates a 3D representation 492 of an environment based on data from the
third LIDAR 400 of Figure 4A, according to an example embodiment. In some examples, the
3D representation 492 may be generated, similarly to the 3D representation 292 and/or the 3D
representation 392, by a computing device as a 3D point cloud based on the data from the third
LIDAR 400. Each point of the 3D cloud, for example, may be associated with a reflected light
pulse from an object in the environment of the LIDAR 400.
[0111] As shown, the 3D representation 492 includes a region 494, similar to the region 294 of
the 3D representation 292 and/or the region 394 of the 3D representation 392, that may be an
unscanned region due to extents of the FOV of the third LIDAR 400 and/or positioning of the
LIDAR 400 (e.g., at a given side of the vehicle other than the top side). However, as shown, the
region 494 is much smaller than the regions 294 and 394. Thus, the LIDAR 400 may be
advantageous for scanning nearby objects similarly to the third LIDAR 130 of Figure IC.
[0112] Unlike the 3D representation 392, however, the 3D representation 492 spans a much
wider field-of-view. For example, the FOV scanned by the LIDAR 400 and illustrated in the 3D
representation 492 may correspond to the contour 166 of Figure 1E. Due in part to the wider
FOV, the 3D representation 492 has a lower resolution than the 3D representation 392. For
instance, as shown, points in the point cloud are further from one another in the 3D
representation 492 compared to points in the point cloud of the 3D representation 392. However,
in some examples, the lower resolution may be sufficient to scan the environment for objects
within a short range of distances to the third LIDAR 400. As shown, for example, a computing
device (e.g., vehicle processor, remote server, etc.) may be utilized to detect a nearby pedestrian
by analyzing region 496 of the 3D representation 492.
[0113] Thus, in some examples, a vehicle that includes a combination of LIDARs such as the
LIDAR 200, the LIDAR 300, and/or the LIDAR 400 may utilize the respective characteristics of
each LIDAR such as refresh rate, resolution, FOV, position, etc., to scan the environment
according to various road conditions and/or scenarios.

                                                 29
[0114] Figure 5 is a flowchart of a method 500, according to an example embodiment. Method
500 shown in Figure 5 presents an embodiment of a method that could be used with any of the
vehicle 100, the LIDARs 120, 122, 130, 200, 300, and/or 400, for example. Method 500 may
include one or more operations, functions, or actions as illustrated by one or more of blocks 502
506. Although the blocks are illustrated in a sequential order, these blocks may in some
instances be performed in parallel, and/or in a different order than those described herein. Also,
the various blocks may be combined into fewer blocks, divided into additional blocks, and/or
removed based upon the desired implementation.
[0115] In addition, for the method 500 and other processes and methods disclosed herein, the
flowchart shows functionality and operation of one possible implementation of present
embodiments. In this regard, each block may represent a module, a segment, a portion of a
manufacturing or operation process, or a portion of program code, which includes one or more
instructions executable by a processor for implementing specific logical functions or steps in the
process. The program code may be stored on any type of computer readable medium, for
example, such as a storage device including a disk or hard drive. The computer readable
medium may include non-transitory computer readable medium, for example, such as computer
readable media that stores data for short periods of time like register memory, processor cache
and Random Access Memory (RAM). The computer readable medium may also include non
transitory media, such as secondary or persistent long term storage, like read only memory
(ROM), optical or magnetic disks, compact-disc read only memory (CD-ROM), for example.
The computer readable media may also be any other volatile or non-volatile storage systems.
The computer readable medium may be considered a computer readable storage medium, for
example, or a tangible storage device.
[0116] In addition, for the method 500 and other processes and methods disclosed herein, each
block in Figure 5 may represent circuitry that is wired to perform the specific logical functions in
the process.
[0117] In some examples, the method 500 and other methods herein may be performed by a
computing system in a vehicle such as the vehicle 100. In other examples, the method 500 and
other methods herein may be performed by a remote system communicatively linked to a vehicle
such as the vehicle 100 to provide operation instructions to the vehicle. In yet other examples,
the method 500 and other methods herein may be performed by several computing systems in

                                                   30
communication with one another such as multiple vehicles or multiple processors on a single
vehicle. In still other examples, the method 500 and other methods herein may be performed by
one or more LIDARs mounted to a vehicle such as the vehicle 100. Thus, in some examples, the
method 500 and other methods herein may facilitate autonomous operation of a vehicle and/or
assist in manual operation of a vehicle (e.g., for accidence avoidance).
[0118] At block 502, the method 500 involves scanning an environment around the vehicle
based on a first light detection and ranging device (LIDAR). In some examples, the first LIDAR
may be positioned at a top side of the vehicle and configured to rotate about an axis, similarly to
the first LIDAR 120 of Figure 1B. For example, the first LIDAR may be included in a sensor
unit mounted to the top side of the vehicle, such as the sensor unit 102 of Figure 1A. In some
examples, the vehicle may include one or more wheels that are positioned at a bottom side of the
vehicle opposite to the top side, similarly to the wheel 112 of the vehicle 100. The first LIDAR
may have a first resolution. The first resolution, for example, may be suitable for scanning the
environment around the vehicle for objects within a medium range of distances to the vehicle
(e.g., 100 meters, etc.), similarly to the LIDAR 200 of Figures 2A-2B.
[0119] At block 504, the method 500 involves scanning a particular field-of-view (FOV) of the
environment based on a second LIDAR. The particular FOV may extend away from the vehicle
along a viewing direction of the second LIDAR. In one example, the second LIDAR may be
positioned adjacent to the first LIDAR at the top side of the vehicle. For instance, the second
LIDAR may be similar to the second LIDAR 122 of Figure lB that is included in the sensor unit
102 mounted to the top side of the vehicle 100. In this instance, the second LIDAR may have a
narrow field-of-view that corresponds to the contour 164 of Figure 1E. Thus, in this example,
the second LIDAR may be suitable for scanning the environment for objects within a long range
of distances (e.g., 300 meters, etc.) to the vehicle. In another example, the second LIDAR may
be positioned at a given side other than the top side. In one instance, the second LIDAR may be
similar to the third LIDAR 130 of Figure IC that is included in the sensor unit 104 mounted to
the front side of the vehicle 100. In another instance, the second LIDAR may be included in any
of the sensor units 106, 108, 110 that are mounted, respectively, to the back side, right side,
and/or left side of the vehicle 100. Thus, in this example, the second LIDAR may be suitable for
scanning the environment for objects within a short range of distances (e.g., 30 meters, etc.) to
the vehicle.

                                                    31
[0120] In some examples, the method 500 may also involve adjusting the viewing direction of
the second LIDAR based on data received from the first LIDAR. In one example, the data
received from the first LIDAR may indicate a moving object in the environment, such as a car.
In this example, the method 500 may include adjusting the viewing direction of the second
LIDAR to focus on the moving object and/or track the moving object using given data from the
second LIDAR. For instance, the given data from the second LIDAR may provide a greater
resolution (e.g., the second resolution), range, and/or refresh rate suitable for tracking the
moving object. In another example, the data received from the first LIDAR may indicate
detection of an object that is difficult to identify due to the first resolution of the first LIDAR. In
this example, the method 500 may include adjusting the viewing direction of the second LIDAR
to scan the unidentified object and facilitate identification of the object using the greater
resolution of the second LIDAR. Other examples are possible as well in line with the discussion
above.
[0121] Accordingly, in some examples, the method 500 may also involve determining a three
dimensional (3D) representation of the environment based on data from the first LIDAR having
the first resolution. In an example scenario, the 3D representation may be similar to the 3D
representation 292 of the LIDAR 200. Further, in some examples, the method 500 may also
involve identifying a portion of the 3D representation for scanning by the second LIDAR.
Continuing with the example scenario, the portion may correspond to the region 296 of the 3D
representation 292. As shown in Figure 2C, according to the scenario, the region 296 may
include various objects that are difficult to identify due to the first resolution of the first LIDAR.
Accordingly, in some examples, the method 500 may also include adjusting the viewing
direction of the second LIDAR to correspond to a FOV of the environment associated with the
identified portion of the 3D representation. Continuing with the example scenario, the viewing
direction may be adjusted to the FOV that includes the objects in the region 296. For instance, in
the scenario, such FOV may correspond to the FOV illustrated in the 3D representation 392 of
Figure 3B. In turn, in some examples, the method 500 may also involve updating the portion of
the 3D representation to have the second resolution of the second LIDAR based on given data
from the second LIDAR. Continuing with the example scenario, the given data from the second
LIDAR may allow generating a higher resolution 3D representation for the portion of the
environment similarly to the 3D representation 392. In turn, for instance, the portion of the 3D

                                                 32
representation may be updated with the higher resolution data to facilitate identification of the
objects such as the objects in regions 396 and 398 of the 3D representation 392.
[0122] In some examples, the method 500 may also involve detecting a first object in the
environment within a threshold distance to the vehicle based on first data from the first LIDAR.
The threshold distance may be based on the first resolution of the first LIDAR. For instance, the
threshold distance may correspond to a medium range of distances where the first resolution of
the first LIDAR may allow detection and/or identification of objects within the medium range.
Referring back to Figure 1E by way of example, the threshold distance may correspond to the
contour 162, and thus the first object may include any object between the contours 160 and 162
similarly to the first LIDAR 120 of the vehicle 100. Further, in some examples, the method 500
may also involve detecting a second object in the environment at a given distance to the vehicle
greater than the threshold distance. Detection of the second object at the given distance may be
based on the second resolution of the second LIDAR. Continuing with the example of Figure
1E, the second object may be included within the contour 164 beyond the threshold distance
indicated by the contour 162. Due to the higher resolution of the second LIDAR, for instance,
objects within such region may be detected and/or identified using the second data from the
second LIDAR.
[0123] At block 506, the method 500 involves operating the vehicle based on the scans of the
environment by the first LIDAR and the second LIDAR. By way of example, the vehicle may
be operated in an autonomous mode. In this example, the vehicle may generate 3D maps of the
environment or portions thereof similarly to the 3D representations 292, 392, and/or 492. In
turn, the vehicle may utilize the 3D maps to navigate the vehicle (e.g., adjust speed, direction,
etc.) safely by avoiding obstacles among other possibilities. The obstacles or objects, for
example, may be detected using an image processing algorithm or other computing method to
analyze the 3D maps and detect or identify the various obstacles or objects. As another example,
the vehicle may be operated in a partially autonomous or manual mode. In this example, the
vehicle may notify a driver or operator of the vehicle of the presence or distance to various
objects or changing road conditions (e.g., street lights, street signs, etc.).
[0124] In some examples, the method 500 may also involve scanning a given FOV of the
environment extending away from a given side of the vehicle other than the top side based on a
third LIDAR positioned along the given side. For instance, the third LIDAR may be similar to

                                                  33
the third LIDAR 130 of Figure IC that is included in sensor 104 that is mounted to the front side
of the vehicle 100 of Figure 1A. Alternatively, for instance, the third LIDAR may be another
LIDAR mounted to another side, such as a LIDAR included in the sensor units 106, 108, and/or
110 of the vehicle 100. The third LIDAR, for instance, may be suitable for scanning the
environment for objects close to the vehicle within a short range of distances (e.g., 30 meters,
etc.). In these examples, the method 500 at block 506 may involve operating the vehicle based
also on the third LIDAR. Thus, in some examples, the method 500 may involve scanning
various portions of the environment around the vehicle, such as the regions indicated by contours
162, 164 and/or 166 of Figure 1E, using the first LIDAR, the second LIDAR, and the third
LIDAR in line with the discussion above.
[0125] Figure 6 is a flowchart of another method 600, according to an example embodiment.
Method 600 shown in Figure 6 presents an embodiment of a method that could be used with any
of the vehicle 100, the LIDARs 120, 122, 130, 200, 300, 400, for example. Method 600 may
include one or more operations, functions, or actions as illustrated by one or more of blocks 602
608. Although the blocks are illustrated in a sequential order, these blocks may in some
instances be performed in parallel, and/or in a different order than those described herein. Also,
the various blocks may be combined into fewer blocks, divided into additional blocks, and/or
removed based upon the desired implementation.
[0126] At block 602, the method 600 involves receiving first data from a first LIDAR configured
to rotate about an axis to scan an environment around the vehicle. The first LIDAR may be
similar to the first LIDAR at block 502 of the method 500. For example, the first LIDAR may
be positioned at a top side of the vehicle, similarly to the first LIDAR 120 of Figure lB. For
instance, the first LIDAR may be included in a sensor unit mounted to the top side of the vehicle,
such as the sensor unit 102 of Figure 1A. In some examples, the vehicle may include one or
more wheels that are positioned at a bottom side of the vehicle opposite to the top side, similarly
to the wheel 112 of the vehicle 100. The first LIDAR may have a first resolution. The first
resolution, for example, may be suitable for scanning the environment around the vehicle for
objects within a medium range of distances to the vehicle (e.g., 100 meters, etc.), similarly to the
LIDAR 200 of Figures 2A-2B.

                                                   34
[0127] Thus, for instance, the first data from the first LIDAR may be received by a computing
device included in the vehicle, or may be received by an external computing device in
communication with the vehicle.
[0128] At block 604, the method 600 involves receiving second data from a second LIDAR
configured to scan a particular FOV of the environment. The particular FOV may extend away
from the vehicle along a viewing direction of the second LIDAR. In one example, the second
LIDAR may be positioned adjacent to the first LIDAR at the top side of the vehicle. For
instance, the second LIDAR may be similar to the second LIDAR 122 of Figure 1B that is
included in the sensor unit 102 mounted to the top side of the vehicle 100. In this instance, the
second LIDAR may have a narrow field-of-view that corresponds to the contour 164 of Figure
1E. Thus, in this example, the second LIDAR may be suitable for scanning the environment for
objects within a long range of distances (e.g., 300 meters, etc.) to the vehicle. In another
example, the second LIDAR may be positioned at a given side other than the top side. In one
instance, the second LIDAR may be similar to the third LIDAR 130 of Figure IC that is included
in the sensor unit 104 mounted to the front side of the vehicle 100. In another instance, the
second LIDAR may be included in any of the sensor units 106, 108, 110 that are mounted,
respectively, to the back side, right side, and/or left side of the vehicle 100. Thus, in this
example, the second LIDAR may be suitable for scanning the environment for objects within a
short range of distances (e.g., 30 meters, etc.) to the vehicle.
[0129] Similarly to the first data at block 602, the second data from the second LIDAR may be
received by a computing device included in the vehicle, or may be received by an external
computing device in communication with the vehicle.
[0130] In some instances, the method 600 may also involve determining a 3D representation of
the environment based on the first data from the first LIDAR. The 3D representation may have
the first resolution of the first LIDAR. By way of example, the 3D representation may be similar
to the 3D representation 292 of Figure 2C. In these instances, the method 600 may also involve
detecting one or more objects in the environment based on the 3D representation. Continuing
with the example, the one or more objects may be similar to the objects in region 296 of the 3D
representation 292. Further, in these instances, the method 600 may involve adjusting the
viewing direction of the second LIDAR to correspond to a FOV of the environment that includes
the one or more objects. In turn, for instance, the method 600 may also involve determining a

                                                  35
given 3D representation of the one or more objects based on the second data from the second
LIDAR responsive to adjusting the viewing direction. The given 3D representation may have
the second resolution of the second LIDAR. Continuing with the example, the given 3D
representation may be similar to the 3D representation 392 of Figure 3B, and may thus have the
higher second resolution of the second LIDAR. Thus, in these instances, the method 600 may
also involve identifying the one or more objects based on the given 3D representation having the
second resolution, and operating the vehicle based on identifying the one or more objects.
Continuing with the example, as shown in Figure 3B, the one or more objects may correspond to
the objects in region 396 (e.g., pedestrian) and region 398 (e.g., light post). Thus, in the
example, the operation of the vehicle may be adjusted by navigating the vehicle away from the
one or more objects, adjusting the speed of the vehicle according to a type of the identified one
or more objects (e.g., lower speed if object is a pedestrian, etc.), and/or navigating the vehicle to
have a threshold distance to the one or more objects that is based on the type of the one or more
objects. Other examples are possible as well.
[0131] At block 606, the method 600 involves determining operation instructions for the vehicle
based on the scans of the environment by the first LIDAR and the second LIDAR. In a first
example, the operation instructions may include navigating the vehicle away from an obstacle in
the environment. In a second example, the operation instructions may include adjusting a
viewing direction of the second LIDAR to correspond to a FOV of the environment that includes
a particular object. In a third example, the operation instructions may include causing a display
or a speaker in the vehicle to present information regarding one or more objects in the
environment. In a fourth example, the operation instructions may include adjusting
configuration of various components of the vehicle (e.g., lights, cameras, etc.) in response to
detection of objects or other road conditions based on the scans of the environment. Other
examples are possible as well.
[0132] In some examples, the method 600 may also involve scanning a given FOV of the
environment extending away from a given side of the vehicle other than the top side based on
third data from a third LIDAR positioned along the given side. The third LIDAR, for example,
may be similar to the third LIDAR 130 of Figure IC, and may have a third resolution suitable for
detection of objects within a short range of distances to the vehicle. In these examples,

                                                 36
determining the operation instructions at block 606 may be based also on the scan of the
environment by the third LIDAR.
[0133] Further, in these examples, the method 600 may also involve detecting an object in the
environment based on data from the first LIDAR, and identifying the object based on given data
from the third LIDAR having the third resolution. For instance, where the object is close to the
vehicle, the data from the first LIDAR may only indicate a portion of the object rather than the
entire object (e.g., due to an unscanned portion of the environment similarly to region 294 of the
3D representation 292. In this instance, the method 600 may identify the object using the given
data from the third LIDAR that has a FOV that includes the entire object.
[0134] Accordingly, in these examples, the method 600 may also involve determining that a
given distance between the object and the vehicle is less than a threshold distance, and
responsively obtaining the given data from the third LIDAR to identify the object. For instance,
where the detected object is at the border of the unscanned region (e.g., region 294 of the 3D
representation 292) and thus is at the given distance that is less than the threshold distance, the
method 600 may operate the third LIDAR to obtain the given data to identify the object.
[0135] At block 608, the method 600 involves providing the operation instructions to the
vehicle. In one example, where the determination of the operation instructions at block 606 is
performed by an external computing device, providing the operation instructions at block 608
may involve the external computing device communicating the operation instructions to the
vehicle (e.g., via a wireless or wired communication interface). In another example, where the
determination at block 606 is performed by a controller included in the vehicle, providing the
operation instructions may involve the controller providing signals to a navigation system or
other control system of the vehicle to adjust operation of the vehicle according to the determined
operating instructions. Other examples are possible as well in line with the discussion above.
[0136] Figure 7 is a flowchart of yet another method 700, according to an example embodiment.
Method 700 shown in Figure 7 presents an embodiment of a method that could be used with any
of the vehicle 100, the LIDARs 120, 122, 130, 200, 300, 400, for example. Method 700 may
include one or more operations, functions, or actions as illustrated by one or more of blocks 702
708. Although the blocks are illustrated in a sequential order, these blocks may in some
instances be performed in parallel, and/or in a different order than those described herein. Also,

                                                  37
the various blocks may be combined into fewer blocks, divided into additional blocks, and/or
removed based upon the desired implementation.
[0137] In some examples, the method 700 may be used in conjunction with the methods 500
and/or 600 to operate devices and systems herein, such as the vehicle 100 and/or the LIDARs
120, 122, 130, 200, 300, 400. In other examples, the method 700 may be used to operate the
devices and the systems herein as an alternative method to the methods 500 and/or 600. Thus, in
some examples, the method 700 may be an additional or alternative method to the methods 500
and/or 600.
[0138] At block 702, the method 700 involves determining a given distance between a vehicle
and an object in an environment of the vehicle based on a first LIDAR of the vehicle, a second
LIDAR of the vehicle, or a third LIDAR of the vehicle. In some examples, the first LIDAR, the
second LIDAR, and the third LIDAR may be similar, respectively, to the first LIDAR 120, the
second LIDAR 122, and the third LIDAR 130 of the vehicle 100. For example, the first LIDAR
may be positioned at a top side of the vehicle and configured to rotate about an axis to scan the
environment around the vehicle, the second LIDAR may be configured to scan a particular FOV
of the environment along a viewing direction of the second LIDAR, and the third LIDAR may be
positioned at a given side of the vehicle other than the top side to scan a given FOV of the
environment that extends away from the given side. Further, for example, the first LIDAR may
have a first resolution, the second LIDAR may have a second resolution, and the third LIDAR
may have a third resolution such that each of the LIDARs is suitable for scanning the
environment for various objects according to the respective characteristics of the respective
LIDAR. For instance, the first LIDAR may be suitable for detection and/or identification of
objects within a medium range of distances to the vehicle (e.g., between contours 160 and 162 of
Figure 1E), the second LIDAR may be suitable for detection and/or identification of objects
within a long range of distances (e.g., within contour 164 of Figure 1E), and the third LIDAR
may be suitable for detection and/or identification of objects within a short range of distances
(e.g., within contour 166 of Figure 1E) among other possibilities.
[0139] Thus, in one example, the given distance may be determined using one or more 3D
representations or point clouds that are determined based on data from the respective LIDAR.
For instance, a given 3D representation may be similar to any of the 3D representations 292, 392,
492 illustrated, respectively, in Figures 2C, 3B, and 4C. In another example, the given distance

                                                   38
may be determined by analyzing reflected light pulses from the object to detectors of the
respective LIDARs in line with the discussion for LIDARs 200, 300, and/or 400.
[0140] At block 704, the method 700 involves tracking the object based on first data from the
first LIDAR based on the given distance being greater than a first threshold and less than a
second threshold. Referring back to Figure 1E by way of example, the object may be tracked
(e.g., position, motion, speed, direction, etc.) using the first data from the first LIDAR if the
object is in the region between contours 160 and 162. In such region, the first resolution of the
first LIDAR may be suitable for detection/identification of the object, and therefore suitable for
tracking the object as well. Thus, in this example, the first threshold may correspond to the
contour 160 and the second threshold may correspond to the contour 162. In some examples, the
first data may be similar to the 3D representation 292 of Figure 2C, or may be data received from
the first LIDAR indicating time-of-flight or a shape/intensity of a reflected light pulse detected
by the first LIDAR among other possibilities.
[0141] At block 706, the method 700 involves tracking the object based on second data from the
second LIDAR based on the given distance being greater than the second LIDAR. Continuing
with the example of Figure 1E, the object may be tracked using the second data from the second
LIDAR if the object is in the region beyond contour 162. For instance, the viewing direction of
the second LIDAR may be adjusted accordingly to keep the object within a FOV of the second
LIDAR, illustrated in Figure 1E as contour 164. In some examples, the second data may be
similar to the 3D representation 392 of Figure 3B, or may be data received from the second
LIDAR indicating time-of-flight or a shape/intensity of a reflected light pulse detected by the
second LIDAR among other possibilities.
[0142] At block 708, the method 700 involves tracking the object based on third data from the
third LIDAR based on the given distance being less than the first threshold. Continuing with the
example of Figure 1E, the object may be tracked using the third data from the third LIDAR if the
object is in the region indicated by contour 166. Such region, for instance, includes a portion of
the environment (e.g., within contour 160) that is unscanned by the first LIDAR and/or the
second LIDAR due to positioning of the respective LIDARS at the top side of the vehicle. In
some examples, the third data may be similar to the 3D representation 492 of Figure 4C, or may
be data received from the third LIDAR indicating time-of-flight or a shape/intensity of a
reflected light pulse detected by the third LIDAR among other possibilities.

                                                   39
[0143] Thus, in an example scenario, the object may move between the various ranges of the
various LIDARs, and the method 700 at blocks 704-708 may allow continuous tracking of the
object using the respective characteristics of each of the first LIDAR, the second LIDAR, and the
third LIDAR. Through this process, for example, the vehicle may utilize the method 700 to track
the object as it moves among the various ranges of distances, and thereby facilitate autonomous
operation (e.g., navigation) and/or accident avoidance.
[0144] Figure 8 illustrates a vehicle 800 operating in an environment that includes one or more
objects, according to an example embodiment. The vehicle 800 may be similar to the vehicle
100. For example, as shown, the vehicle 800 includes sensor units 802, 806, 808, and 810 that
are similar, respectively, to the sensor units 102, 106, 108, and 110 of the vehicle 100. For
instance, the sensor unit 802 may include a first LIDAR (not shown) and a second LIDAR (not
shown) that are similar, respectively, to the first LIDAR 120 and the second LIDAR 122 of the
vehicle 100. Further, for instance, each of the sensor units 806-810 may also include a LIDAR
similar to the third LIDAR 130 of the vehicle 100. As shown, the environment of the vehicle
800 includes various objects such as cars 812, 814, 816, road sign 818, tree 820, building 822,
street sign 824, pedestrian 826, dog 828, car 830, driveway 832, and lane lines including lane
line 834. In accordance with the present disclosure, the vehicle 800 may perform the methods
and processes herein, such as methods 500-700, to facilitate autonomous operation of the vehicle
800 and/or accidence avoidance by the vehicle 800. Below are example scenarios for operation
of the vehicle 800 in accordance with the present disclosure.
[0145] In a first scenario, the vehicle 800 may utilize the method 500 and/or 600 to detect and/or
identify the various objects illustrated in Figure 8. In the first scenario, the vehicle 800 may
identify the cars 812-816 as moving objects that may be pertinent to navigational behavior of the
vehicle 800. For instance, the vehicle 800 may utilize the various scanning resolutions and
ranges of the respective LIDARs to properly identify the cars 812-816 as moving vehicles.
Further, in the first scenario, the vehicle 800 may utilize the method 700 to track the cars 812
816 and facilitate such navigation. For instance, the vehicle 800 may adjust its speed, or may
change lanes to avoid contact with the cars 812-816 based on data from the various LIDARs in
the sensor units 802-8 10.
[0146] In a second scenario, the vehicle 800 may utilize a LIDAR of the sensor unit 808 and/or
806 to detect, identify, and/or track the car 812 that is in close proximity to the vehicle 800.

                                                 40
Such LIDAR, for example, may be similar to the third LIDAR 130 of the vehicle 100 that is
suitable for scanning the environment for objects within a short range of distances to the vehicle
800 due to the positioning of such LIDAR (e.g., in the sensor units 808 and/or 810). In contrast,
for example, LIDARs in the sensor unit 802 may be less suitable for scanning the environment
for the car 812 due to the positioning of such LIDARs at a top side of the vehicle 800 as shown
in Figure 8. For instance, the car 812 may be included at least partially within a region of the
environment unscanned by the top-mounted LIDARs similar to the region illustrated by contour
160 in Figure 1E.
[0147] In a third scenario, the vehicle 800 may utilize a first LIDAR of the sensor unit 802,
similar to the LIDAR 120 of the vehicle 100, to detect and/or identify the car 814 that is within a
threshold distance (e.g., medium range of distances) to the vehicle 800. In the scenario, the car
814 may be in the process of changing lanes to the same lane as the vehicle 800. In the scenario,
the vehicle 800 may need to adjust its speed and/or change lanes to maintain a safe distance to
the car 814. However, data from the first LIDAR may have a first resolution insufficient to
detect whether the car 814 is crossing the lane line 834, or may be insufficient to even
detect/identify the lane line 834. Thus, in the scenario, the vehicle 800 may adjust a viewing
direction of a second LIDAR, similar to the second LIDAR 122 of the vehicle 100, that is
included in the sensor unit 802 and that has a higher second resolution than the first resolution of
the first LIDAR. In turn, the vehicle 800 may resolve the lane line 834 and/or whether the car
814 is crossing the lane lines. Alternatively, for instance, the vehicle 800 may utilize the higher
resolution of the second LIDAR to detect a left light signal of the car 814 to determine that the
vehicle 814 is changing lanes among other possibilities.
[0148] In a fourth scenario, the car 816 may be driving erratically or moving at a high speed
relative to the vehicle 800 among other possibilities. In this scenario, the vehicle 800 may track
the car 816 using the method 700, and may navigate accordingly (e.g., change lanes, adjust
speed, etc.) to avoid contact with the car 816.
[0149] In a fifth scenario, the vehicle 800 may detect the road sign 818 using a medium range
LIDAR, similar to the first LIDAR 120 of the vehicle 100. In turn, the vehicle 800 may adjust a
viewing direction of a higher resolution LIDAR and/or longer range LIDAR, similar to the
second LIDAR 122 of the vehicle 100, to analyze the road sign 818 for information. The higher
resolution of the second LIDAR, for instance, may allow resolving the information due to

                                                    41
differences of reflectivity of features in the road sign 818. In one instance of the scenario, the
road sign may indicate hazards ahead or a closed lane, and the vehicle 800 may adjust its speed
or change lanes accordingly. In another instance of the scenario, the road sign may indicate
traffic delays ahead, and the vehicle 800 may then instruct a navigation system of the vehicle 800
to determine an alternate route. Other variations of the scenario are possible as well.
[0150] In a sixth scenario, the vehicle may utilizes methods 500 and/or 600 to scan the
environment for roadside objects such as the tree 820, the building 822, the street sign 824, the
pedestrian 826, the dog 828, the car 830, and/or the driveway 832. By utilizing the various
properties of the various LIDARs in the sensor units 802-810 in line with the present disclosure
(e.g., resolution, range, etc.), the vehicle 800 in the scenario may identify the objects 820, 822,
and 824 as inanimate objects and may thus allow the vehicle 800 to change lanes into the lane
adjacent to the inanimate objects.
[0151] As a variation of the scenario above, where the objects are animate objects such as the
pedestrian 826 or the dog 828, the vehicle 800 may avoid the right lane in anticipation of an
event where the animate objects move. Further, the vehicle 800 in the scenario may adjust a
viewing direction of a high resolution LIDAR (e.g., second LIDAR 122, etc.) and/or obtain data
from a LIDAR of the sensor unit 808 to identify and/or track such animate objects in line with
the methods 500-700.
[0152] In some variations of the scenario above, the vehicle 800 may avoid the right lane even
when the objects are inanimate. In one example, the vehicle 800 may determine that the street
sign 824 is a bus stop sign, and may thereby avoid the right lane to allow room for a bus. In
another example, the vehicle 800 may determine that the car 830 is moving out of the driveway
832, and may thereby navigate accordingly to allow room for the car 830.
[0153] In a seventh scenario, the vehicle 800 may utilize data from LIDARs in the sensor units
802-810 to determine a state of the vehicle 800. In the scenario, for instance, a door, hood, or
bumper of the vehicle 800 may be open or ajar. In the scenario, the data from LIDARs in the
sensor units 802-810 may indicate that such component of the vehicle 800 is open or ajar. For
instance, the LIDAR in the sensor unit 808 may be configured to have a 270-degree FOV. In
this instance, the LIDAR may not scan components of the vehicle 800 such as the hood. Thus, in
the event that the hood of the vehicle 800 appears in the scan of the environment by the LIDAR

                                                42
of the sensor unit 808, the vehicle 800 may determine that the right door where the sensor unit
808 is mounted may be open or ajar.
[0154] Other scenarios are possible as well. Thus, the present methods and systems may
facilitate autonomous operation and/or accidence avoidance for a vehicle such as the vehicle 800
by utilizing multiple LIDARs that have characteristics and positions around the vehicle in line
with the exemplary embodiments herein.

910 may be configured to store and execute instructions for determining a 3D representation of
the environment around the vehicle 900 using the LIDAR unit 932. Other examples are possible
as well.
[0179] As shown, the computer system 910 includes the processor 912 and data storage 914.
The processor 912 may comprise one or more general-purpose processors and/or one or more
special-purpose processors. To the extent the processor 912 includes more than one processor,

[0187] The one or more programming instructions 1004 may be, for example, computer
executable and/or logic implemented instructions. In some examples, a computing device may
be configured to provide various operations, functions, or actions in response to the
programming instructions 1004 conveyed to the computing device by one or more of the
computer readable medium 1006, the computer recordable medium 1008, and/or the
communications medium 1010.
[0188] The computer readable medium 1006 may also be distributed among multiple data
storage elements, which could be remotely located from each other. The computing device that
executes some or all of the stored instructions could be an external computer, or a mobile
computing platform, such as a smartphone, tablet device, personal computer, wearable device,
etc. Alternatively, the computing device that executes some or all of the stored instructions
could be remotely located computer system, such as a server.

only. As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that other arrangements and other elements
(e.g. machines, interfaces, functions, orders, and groupings of functions, etc.) can be used
instead, and some elements may be omitted altogether according to the desired results. Further,
many of the elements that are described are functional entities that may be implemented as
discrete or distributed components or in conjunction with other components, in any suitable
combination and location, or other structural elements described as independent structures may
be combined.

        wherein the second LIDAR scans, according to a second scanning resolution different
than the first scanning resolution, a field-of-view (FOV) of the environment extending away
from the vehicle along a viewing direction of the second LIDAR; and
        a controller that selects one of the plurality of LIDARs for tracking an object in the
environment based on at least a comparison of a threshold distance to an object distance between
the object and the vehicle, wherein the threshold distance is based on the first scanning
resolution.
15.     The vehicle of claim 14, wherein the controller selects the first LIDAR based on at least
the object distance being less than the threshold distance, and wherein the controller selects the
second LIDAR based on at least the object distance being greater than the threshold distance.
16.     The vehicle of claim 14, wherein the first LIDAR is mounted to a first side of the vehicle,
wherein the second LIDAR is also mounted to the first side of the vehicle,
        wherein the plurality of LIDARs also includes a third LIDAR mounted to a second side
of the vehicle, and wherein the third LIDAR scans a FOV of the environment extending away
from the second side.
17.     The vehicle of claim 16, wherein the threshold distance is a first threshold distance,
wherein the controller selects the first LIDAR for tracking the object also based on the object
distance being greater than a second threshold distance, wherein the controller selects the third
LIDAR for tracking the object based on at least the object distance being less than the second
threshold distance, and wherein the second threshold distance is based on a position of the first
LIDAR at the first side of the vehicle.
18.     A method comprising:
        scanning, via a first light detection and ranging device (LIDAR) that rotates about an
axis, according to a first scanning resolution of the first LIDAR, an environment around a
vehicle;
        scanning, via a second LIDAR, according to a second scanning resolution of the second
LIDAR different than the first scanning resolution, a field-of-view (FOV) of the environment
that extends away from the vehicle along a viewing direction of the second LIDAR;

                                                 54
         tracking an object in the environment using the first LIDAR in response to the object
being within a threshold distance to the vehicle, wherein the threshold distance is based on the
first scanning resolution; and
         tracking the object using the second LIDAR in response to the object being at greater
than the threshold distance to the vehicle.
19.      The method of claim 18, further comprising:
         determining a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the environment having the first
scanning resolution based on first data from the first LIDAR;
         detecting the object based on the 3D representation;
         adjusting, based on the 3D representation, the viewing direction of the second LIDAR
toward the object; and
         determining a given 3D representation of the object having the second scanning
resolution based on second data from the second LIDAR.
20.      The method of claim 18, further comprising:
         detecting, via the second LIDAR, the object at greater than the threshold distance to the
vehicle based on at least the second scanning resolution of the second LIDAR.
