   Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller arranged to implement a game
25 where a player is allocated a number of game rounds to
   achieve a target outcome. During the game rounds
   contributions towards the outcome are accumulated and the
   player receives an award if the target outcome is
   achieved. In an embodiment, the player selects the target
30 outcome from target outcomes having different levels of
   difficulty with greater awards associated with higher
   difficulty, thus introducing a tension between the
   player's selection and the prospects of success.
35 General construction of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
                                           10363650_ (GHMatters) P75989.AU.4 13/06/18

                              - 9
   a first form, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
 5 In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
10 For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
15 executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
20 However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.        For example,
25 the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
30
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system comprises
   several core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
35 arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
                                           10363650 1 (GHMatters) P75989.AU.4 13/06/18

                               - 10
   instructions and play the game.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
 5 credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 comprising one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions                  (e.g. to
   place bets),  and one or more speakers 58.
10
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
15 display. Typically, the game play instructions are stored
   as program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:                   a
20 microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
25 machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
30 interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.    Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
35 reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   A player marketing module  (not shown) having a
   reading device may also be provided for the purpose of
                                             10363650 1 (GHMatters) P75989.AU.4 13/06/18

                               - 11
   reading a player tracking device, for example as part of a
   loyalty program.  The player tracking device may be in the
   form of a card, flash drive or any other portable storage
   medium capable of being read by the reading device.
 5
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.            Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
10 panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
15 display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.  Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
   crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.    The top box 26 may also include
20 a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
   type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
25 a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102.   Instructions and data to control
30 operation of the processor 102 are stored in a memory 103,
   which is in data communication with the processor 102.
   Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type of memory, with such memories being collectively
35 represented by the memory 103.
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
                                             10363650_ (GHMatters) P75989.AU.4 13/06/18

                              - 12
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or the
 5 peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.           Persons
10 skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
15 controller 101 and comprise one or more displays 106, a
   touch screen and/or buttons 107, a card and/or ticket
   reader 108, a printer 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin
   input mechanism 110 and a coin output mechanism 111.
   Additional hardware may be included as part of the gaming
20 machine 100, or hardware may be omitted as required for
   the specific implementation. For example, while buttons or
   touch screens are typically used in gaming machines to
   allow a player to place a wager and initiate a play of a
   game any input device that enables the player to input
25 game play instructions may be used.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
30 information, accounting information or other information
   to a central controller, server or database and receive
   data or commands from the central controller, server or
   database.
35 Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                   The RAM
                                           10363650 1 (GHMatters) P75989.AU.4 13/06/18

                              - 13
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
   execution by the processor 102 and related data.                   The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
 5 103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
10 It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
15 Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
20 network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
25 machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
30 associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.

   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
                                           10363650 1 (GHMatters) P75989.AU.4 13/06/18

                              - 14
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
 5 management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform

   Further detail of gaming system
   In the embodiment, the game is triggered by trigger
   monitor 626A as a feature game from a base game conducted
20 by base game controller 626 and displayed in a first
   display area 54A. In the embodiment, the feature is
   conducted as a second screen feature and is displayed in a
   second display area 54B which may be on a separate display
   to the first display area 54A.
25
   The feature can be triggered in accordance with any of the
   know eligibility criteria including based on turnover, by
   being purchased in the base game, by a system event or by
   a symbol combination  in the base game.
30
   The selection processor 623 is arranged to offer via
   display 54 a plurality of different selectable target
   outcomes specified by target outcome data 642.              In the
   embodiment, the player operates game play mechanism 56 to
35 select one of the target outcomes. In an alternative
   embodiment, the player may be allowed to construct the
   target outcome from a plurality of components specified by
                                            10363650 1 (GHMatters) P75989.AU.4 13/06/18

                               - 16
    target outcome data 642. For example, the player may be
    offered a plurality of different start components to the
    target outcome and, depending on the selected start, a
    plurality of different end components. In such
  5 embodiments, an award may be made for achieving a
    component of the target outcome.
    In some embodiments, the selection processor may make a
    default selection based on game rules if a time out
10  condition is met.
    The game round controller 622A of outcome generator 622
    then conducts a series of game rounds for achieving the
    target outcome; the initial number of game rounds being
15  related to the selected target outcome. Each game round
    involves a symbol selector 622B selecting symbols
    specified by symbol data 641. The selected symbols are
    advised to the display controller 625 which causes them to
    be displayed on display 54 at a set of display positions.
20
    One example of selecting symbols is for the symbol
    selector 622B to access the random number generator 621 to
    select symbols using the game rules 644 for display as a
    plurality of spinning reels. The symbol sets 641 can
25  specify a sequence of symbols for each reel such that the
    symbol selector 622B can select a symbol by selecting a
    stopping position in the sequence. The selected symbols
    are then evaluated by symbol evaluator 622C to determine
    whether they include any contributions towards the target
30  outcome, for example, a specific symbol combination that
    contributes toward the target outcome. Accumulator 622D
    accumulates any contribution and progress towards the
    target outcome is displayed on display 54B by display
    controller 625. In some embodiments, players may be
35  entitled to purchase additional contributions.
    The game round controller 622A continues to conduct game
                                            10363650_ (GHMatters) P75989.AU.4 13/06/18

                              - 17
   rounds until all the game rounds have been exhausted.                           The
   number of available game rounds 644 is specified by the
   game rule data 644 and the number of game rounds may be
   used as one factor to control the difficulty of achieving
 5 the target outcome. In some embodiments, particular
   outcomes of symbol selection may cause the number of game
   rounds to be varied, for example by adding to or
   subtracting from the current number of game rounds.                        The
   remaining number of game rounds is stored as the game
10 round data 643.  The player may also be able to place an
   additional bet to buy more game rounds.
   Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the game round
   controller 622A is arranged to continue to conduct rounds
15 until either the accumulator 622D accumulates sufficient
   contributions to achieve the target outcome or the game
   rounds are exhausted.
   If sufficient contributions are made, the award determiner
20 624 is advised and the award determiner 624 determines the
   prize 645 corresponding to the target outcome 642, updates
   the credit meter 646 and controls the display by means of
   display controller 625 to show the awarding of the prize.
25 It will be appreciated that contributions towards the
   outcome can be achieved in a number of ways, for example,
   they can relate to a specific symbol combination created
   by selecting a set of symbols for display, they can be
   created by specific symbol being in the set of symbols,
30 etc.  A person skilled in the art will appreciate that
   other techniques could be used to select symbols including
   drawing a card from a set of cards, rolling a dice, etc.
   By way of example, the contributions can be in the form of
35 a movement towards an outcome in the form of a destination
   or by removing an obstacle to reaching a destination. In
   such embodiments, the relative difficulty of achieving an
                                           10363650 1 (GHMatters) P75989.AU.4 13/06/18

                               - 18
   outcome can be controlled in a number of ways, including
   the amount of movement needed to reach an destination
   associated with the target outcome (which may be an
   origin),  the number of obstacles, or the number of game
 5 rounds.
   Accordingly, as the difficulty of achieving an outcome can
   be controlled, there is a tension between a player's
   selection of a target outcome and the player's prospects
10 of achieving the outcome.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the target
   outcome may be chosen in some other manner than by a
   player.   For example, the target outcome be defined based
15 on a player's previous expenditure in the game, the number
   times they have entered the feature game or the manner in
   which they enter the feature game, for example a
   particular combination achieved when entering the feature
   game.
20
   The method is summarised in Figure 7 which shows a feature
   being triggered 705, a player selection of a target
   outcome being made 710, and a set of bonus games started
   715.   In each bonus game round, symbols are selected 720
25 and it is determined 725 whether this results in a
   contribution to the outcome.    If it does, the contribution
   is accumulated 730 and is determined 735 whether the
   outcome has been achieved.    If the outcome has been
   achieved, an award is made 740.    If not, the number of
30 allocated game rounds is decremented 745 and is determined
   whether the allocation of game rounds has been exhausted
   750 in which case the game ends 755. If the allocation has
   not been exhausted, the method proceeds by selecting the
   symbols for a further game round 720.

   Example
                                             10363650 1 (GHMatters) P75989.AU.4 13/06/18

                              - 19
   Figure 8 shows an exemplary display 800 of an example
   where a player is given a limited number of total feature
   spins and the player can select three levels of difficulty
   and hence select from three outcomes.   The higher the
 5 number of obstacles, the greater the reward at the end, as
   denoted by the increasing sizes of the treasure chests
   850, 840, 830.
   In this example, the theme is of salvaging treasure from a
lo wreck 823 and accordingly a salvage ship 822 is displayed
   and a diver 821 indicates the player's current progress
   towards the target outcome.   The target outcomes are each
   of the three treasure chests 830, 840 and 850.                 There are
   obstacles 831, 832, 841, 842 and 851 between the player
15 position 821 and the target outcomes 830, 840 and 850.
   The player has a trade off for the higher prize of less
   chance to actually getting the prize. The obstacles are
   chosen to fit with the theme and are displayed as blocked
   doors, rubble, barrels, hanging nets, etc.              Reels are
20 displayed in areas 811, 812 and 813, where the player has
   a chance to spin up items that help clear the obstacles.
   For example, the player may spin up a key to open a lock
   door.  Once the player reaches a treasure chest 830, 840
   or 850 the remaining spins are used to drag the treasure
25 chest back to the salvage ship.   Thus, the higher level of
   obstacles and the more positions the player is required to
   traverse to get the obstacle back to the ship 822 depict
   the level of difficulty.   It will be appreciated that the
   individual reel spins of each game outcome displayed in
30 the reels 811 to 813 contribute to towards the players
   progress to achieving the target outcome and that this
   accumulation of contributions is represented by the
   diver's current position and status (e.g. the direction
   the diver is shown travelling in, whether or not they are
35 carrying the treasure, etc).   A person skilled in the art
   will appreciate that there can be a number of variations
   to this example, for example, it may be possible for
                                            10363650 1 (GHMatters) P75989.AU.4 13/06/18

                               - 20
   obstacles to be put back after they have been removed or
   for additional obstacles added in response to a particular
   outcome of the reels 811 or 813 or for game rounds                      (i.e.
   spins) to be added or subtracted.
 5
   In the above example, the target outcome combines the
   player's trip from an origin to a destination and back to
   the origin.  In other embodiments the player may journey
   solely to the destination.
10
   Obstacle replacement could be dependent on the outcome of
   reels, duration of time or the amount of funds bet.                         In
   one embodiment, the player could purchase the removal of
   an obstacle.
15
   Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate that the
   method of the embodiment could be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a computer readable medium, such as a
20 disc or a memory  (for example, that could replace part of
   memory 103) or as a data signal  (for example, by
   transmitting it from a server).
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
25 invention that many modifications may be made without
   departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
   It is to be understood that, if any prior art publication
