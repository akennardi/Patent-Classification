                                          ABSTRACT
   A nozzle for a fan assembly includes an air inlet, an air outlet, an interior passage for
   conveying air from the air inlet to the air outlet, an annular inner wall, and an outer wall
 5 extending about the inner wall. The interior passage is located between the inner wall
   and the outer wall. The inner wall at least partially defines a bore through which air
   from outside the nozzle is drawn by air emitted from the air outlet. The air outlet is
   arranged to direct air over an external surface at least partially defining the bore. A
   flow control port is located downstream from that surface. A flow control chamber is
10 provided for conveying air to the flow control port. A control mechanism selectively
   enables a flow of air through the flow control port to deflect an air flow emitted from
   the air outlet.

                                       A FAN ASSEMBLY
                                FIELD OF THE INVENTION
   The present invention relates to a nozzle for a fan assembly, and a fan assembly
 5 comprising such a nozzle.
                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
   Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be
   considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common
10 general knowledge in the field.
   A conventional domestic fan typically includes a set of blades or vanes mounted for
   rotation about an axis, and drive apparatus for rotating the set of blades to generate an
   air flow. The movement and circulation of the air flow creates a 'wind chill' or breeze
15 and, as a result, the user experiences a cooling effect as heat is dissipated through
   convection and evaporation.      The blades are generally located within a cage which
   allows an air flow to pass through the housing while preventing users from coming into
   contact with the rotating blades during use of the fan.
20 US 2,488,467 describes a fan which does not use caged blades to project air from the
   fan assembly. Instead, the fan assembly comprises a base which houses a motor-driven
   impeller for drawing an air flow into the base, and a series of concentric, annular
   nozzles connected to the base and each comprising an annular outlet located at the front
   of the nozzle for emitting the air flow from the fan. Each nozzle extends about a bore
25 axis to define a bore about which the nozzle extends.
   Each nozzle is in the shape of an airfoil. An airfoil may be considered to have a leading
   edge located at the rear of the nozzle, a trailing edge located at the front of the nozzle,
   and a chord line extending between the leading and trailing edges. In US 2,488,467 the
30 chord line of each nozzle is parallel to the bore axis of the nozzles. The air outlet is

                                                 2
   located on the chord line, and is arranged to emit the air flow in a direction extending
   away from the nozzle and along the chord line.
   Another fan assembly which does not use caged blades to project air from the fan
 5 assembly is described in WO 2010/10045 1. This fan assembly comprises a cylindrical
   base which also houses a motor-driven impeller for drawing a primary air flow into the
   base, and a single annular nozzle connected to the base and comprising an annular
   mouth through which the primary air flow is emitted from the fan. The nozzle defines
   an opening through which air in the local environment of the fan assembly is drawn by
10 the primary air flow emitted from the mouth, amplifying the primary air flow.           The
   nozzle includes a Coanda surface over which the mouth is arranged to direct the primary
   air flow.    The Coanda surface extends symmetrically about the central axis of the
   opening so that the air flow generated by the fan assembly is in the form of an annular
   jet having a cylindrical or frusto-conical profile.
15
   The user is able to change the direction in which the air flow is emitted from the nozzle
   in one of two ways. The base includes an oscillation mechanism which can be actuated
   to cause the nozzle and part of the base to oscillate about a vertical axis passing through
   the centre of the base so that that air flow generated by the fan assembly is swept about
20 an arc of around 1800. The base also includes a tilting mechanism to allow the nozzle
   and an upper part of the base to be tilted relative to a lower part of the base by an angle
   of up to 100 to the horizontal.
                              SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
25 In a first aspect, the present invention provides a nozzle for a fan assembly, the nozzle
   comprising an air inlet; an air outlet; an interior passage for conveying air from the air
   inlet to the air outlet; an annular inner wall; an outer wall extending about the inner
   wall, the interior passage being located between the inner wall and the outer wall, the
   inner wall at least partially defining a bore through which air from outside the nozzle is
30 drawn by air emitted from the air outlet, the air outlet being arranged to direct air over
   an external surface of the nozzle; a flow control port located downstream from the air

                                                  3
    outlet and said surface; a flow control chamber for conveying air to the flow control
   port; and control means for selectively inhibiting a flow of air through the flow control
   port.
 5 Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims,
   the words "comprise", "comprising", and the like are to be construed in an inclusive
   sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of
   "including, but not limited to".
10 Through varying a flow of air through the flow control port, the profile of the air flow
   emitted from the air outlet can be changed. The variation of the flow of air through the
   flow control port can have the effect of changing a pressure gradient across the air flow
   emitted from an air outlet of the nozzle. The change in the pressure gradient can result
   in the generation of a force that acts on the air flow emitted from the air outlet. The
15 action of this force can result in the air flow moving in a desired direction.
   The external surface over which the air outlet is arranged to direct air preferably at least
   partially defines the bore. The external surface preferably extends at least partially
   about the axis of the bore. This surface may surround the axis of the bore. The external
20 surface preferably comprises a curved Coanda surface located immediately downstream
   from the air outlet. The external surface preferably comprises a diffuser surface which
   tapers outwardly relative to an axis of the bore.       This diffuser surface is preferably
   located downstream from the curved Coanda surface.           The diffuser surface may be
   frusto-conical in shape, or it may be curved.
25
   The nozzle preferably comprises a guide surface located between the air outlet and the
   flow control port for guiding the air emitted from the air outlet in a desired direction.
   The guide surface preferably forms part of the external surface over which air is
   directed by the air outlet. The guide surface is preferably located between the diffuser
30 surface and the flow control port. The guide surface is preferably angled relative to the
   diffuser surface. In a preferred embodiment, the guide surface is preferably shaped to

                                                 4
   taper inwardly relative to the diffuser surface, and preferably relative also to the axis of
   the bore. The guide surface may be faceted, with each facet being either straight or
   curved.    The flow control port is preferably located adjacent to the guide surface.
   Preferably, the flow control port is located immediately downstream from the guide
 5 surface. The guide surface preferably extends at least partially about the bore, and more
   preferably surrounds the bore.
   The nozzle preferably comprises an air flow guiding member, which may be connected
   to the inner wall of the nozzle. The guide surface is preferably defined by an external
10 surface of the air flow guiding member. The air flow guiding member may at least
   partially define the flow control port. In a preferred example, the flow control port is
   located between an internal surface of the air flow guiding member, and an external
   surface of a third wall of the nozzle. This third wall of the nozzle is preferably a front
   wall of the nozzle. The front wall of the nozzle is preferably connected to at least one
15 of the inner wall and the outer wall of the nozzle.
   The flow control port is preferably arranged to direct an air flow over a second external
   surface of the nozzle. This second external surface of the nozzle is preferably part of
   the external surface of the front wall of the nozzle. The second external surface may at
20 least partially define the bore of the nozzle, more preferably a front section of the bore
   of the nozzle.    The second external surface preferably comprises a second Coanda
   surface located immediately downstream from the flow control port.             The second
   external surface preferably comprises a second diffuser surface which tapers outwardly
   relative to an axis of the bore. The second diffuser surface may be frusto-conical, or it
25 may be curved.
   The nozzle preferably comprises a second guide surface located downstream from the
   flow control port for guiding the air emitted from the flow control port in a desired
   direction. The second guide surface is preferably angled relative to the guide surface
30 located downstream from the air outlet.       This second guide surface may be located
   downstream from the second diffuser surface. Alternatively, the second diffuser surface

                                                 5
   may be considered to form at least part of this second guide surface; for example a part
   of the second diffuser surface located remote from the flow control port may be
   considered to provide this second guide surface.        The second guide surface may be
   angled relative to the second diffuser surface. The second guide surface is preferably
 5 angled relative to the guide surface located downstream from the air outlet.    The guide
   surface located downstream from the air outlet is referred hereafter as the first guide
   surface.
   When air is emitted from the air outlet, it will tend to become attached to one or more of
10 the surfaces located downstream from the air outlet. In a preferred example, these
   surfaces include at least the diffuser surface located downstream from the air outlet, and
   the first guide surface located downstream from the diffuser surface.      The first guide
   surface is preferably contiguous with the diffuser surface so that the air attaches to the
   first guide surface as it flows away from the diffuser surface. The shape of the first
15 guide surface directs the air flow away from the external surface of the front wall of the
   nozzle.
   The direction in which air is emitted from the nozzle tends to depend on the shape of the
   final external surface to which the air flow is attached. When the flow of air through the
20 flow control port is inhibited, for example by occluding the flow control port or by
   inhibiting the flow of air through the flow control chamber connected to the flow
   control port, the shape of the first guide surface is preferably such that this air flow is
   guided away from the second external surface of the nozzle, and thus away from the
   second guide surface of the nozzle. Consequently, when the flow of air through the
25 flow control port is inhibited the direction in which the air is emitted from the nozzle
   will depend on the shape of the first guide surface of the nozzle.
   When air is emitted from the flow control port simultaneously with the emission of air
   from the air outlet, the air emitted from the flow control port will tend to become
30 attached to the second external surface located downstream from the flow control port.
   The emission of air from the flow control port changes the pressure gradient across the

                                                 6
   air flow emitted from the air outlet. For example, a relatively low pressure may be
   created adjacent to the part of the second external surface located immediately
   downstream from the flow control port, and thus on one side of the air flow emitted
   from the air outlet. The pressure differential thus created across the air flow emitted
 5 from the air outlet generates a force which urges that air flow towards the second
   external surface. This can result in both the air emitted from the air outlet and the air
   emitted from the flow control port becoming attached to the second external surface of
   the nozzle. As mentioned above, the direction in which air is emitted from the nozzle
   depends on the shape of the final surface to which the air flow is attached, and so in this
10 case the direction in which the air is emitted from the nozzle will depend on the shape
   of the second guide surface of the nozzle.
   When the flow of air through the flow control port is subsequently inhibited, the
   pressure different across the air flow emitted from the air outlet is removed. As there is
15 no longer any force pushing the air flow towards the second external surface, the air
   flow preferably becomes detached from that surface, and so the direction in which the
   air is emitted from the nozzle depends, once again, on the shape of the first guide
   surface of the nozzle.
20 Thus, through variation of an air flow from a flow control port the air flow emitted from
   the air outlet may become selectively attached to either one guide surface or two guide
   surfaces of the nozzle.
   In a second aspect, the present invention provides a nozzle for a fan assembly, the
25 nozzle comprising an air inlet; an air outlet; an interior passage for conveying air from
   the air inlet to the air outlet; an annular inner wall; an outer wall extending about the
   inner wall, the interior passage being located between the inner wall and the outer wall,
   the inner wall at least partially defining a bore through which air from outside the
   nozzle is drawn by air emitted from the air outlet, a first guide surface located
30 downstream from the air outlet; a flow control port located downstream from the first
   guide surface; a second guide surface located downstream from the flow control port,

                                                7
   the second guide surface being angled relative to the first guide surface; a flow control
   chamber for conveying air to the flow control port; and control means for selectively
   inhibiting a flow of air through the flow control port. Through selectively inhibiting the
   flow of air through the flow control port, the air emitted from the air outlet may become
 5 detached from the second guide surface.
   As mentioned above, the flow control port is preferably arranged to direct an air flow
   over a second external surface of the nozzle. When air is emitted from the flow control
   port simultaneously with the emission of air from the air outlet, the air emitted from
10 both the air outlet and the flow control port will tend to become attached to the second
   external surface located downstream from the flow control port. However, the nozzle
   may be arranged in an alternative manner so that when the flow of air through the flow
   control port is inhibited the air emitted from the air outlet becomes attached to the
   second external surface, and when the flow of air through the flow control port is
15 enabled the air emitted from the air outlet becomes detached from the second external
   surface. For example, the flow control port may be arranged to direct a flow control air
   flow inwardly, for example radially inwardly, towards a vertical plane extending
   through, and containing, the bore axis. As the flow control air flow is emitted from the
   flow control port, the air emitted from the air outlet is deflected away from the second
20 external surface of the nozzle. Consequently, when the flow of air through the flow
   control port is enabled the direction in which the air is emitted from the nozzle will
   depend on the shape of the first guide surface of the nozzle.
   The air outlet is preferably in the form of a slot.       The interior passage preferably
25 surrounds the bore of the nozzle.      The air outlet preferably extends at least partially
   about the bore. For example, the nozzle may comprise a single air outlet which extends
   at least partially about the bore. For example, the air outlet also may surround the bore.
   The bore may have a circular cross-section in a plane which is perpendicular to the bore
   axis, and so the air outlet may be circular in shape.       Alternatively, the nozzle may
30 comprise a plurality of air outlets which are spaced about the bore.

                                                8
   The nozzle may be shaped to define a bore which has a non-circular cross-section in a
   plane which is perpendicular to the bore axis. For example, this cross-section may be
   elliptical or rectangular. The nozzle may have two relatively long straight sections, an
   upper curved section and a lower curved section, with each curved section joining
 5 respective ends of the straight sections. Again, the nozzle may comprise a single air
   outlet which extends at least partially about the bore. For example, each of the straight
   sections and the upper curved section of the nozzle may comprise a respective part of
   this air outlet. Alternatively, the nozzle may comprise two air outlets each for emitting
   a respective part of an air flow. Each straight section of the nozzle may comprise a
10 respective one of these two air outlets.
   The air emitted from the nozzle, hereafter referred to as a primary air flow, entrains air
   surrounding the nozzle, which thus acts as an air amplifier to supply both the primary
   air flow and the entrained air to the user. The entrained air will be referred to here as a
15 secondary air flow. The secondary air flow is drawn from the room space, region or
   external environment surrounding the nozzle. The primary air flow combines with the
   entrained secondary air flow to form a combined, or total, air flow projected forward
   from the front of the nozzle.
20 The variation of the direction in which the primary air flow is emitted from the nozzle
   can vary the degree of the entrainment of the secondary air flow by the primary air flow,
   and thus vary the flow rate of the combined air flow generated by the fan assembly.
   Without wishing to be bound by any theory, we consider that the rate of entrainment of
25 the secondary air flow by the primary air flow may be related to the magnitude of the
   surface area of the outer profile of the primary air flow emitted from the nozzle. For a
   given flow rate of air entering the nozzle, when the primary air flow is outwardly
   tapering, or flared, the surface area of the outer profile is relatively high, promoting
   mixing of the primary air flow and the air surrounding the nozzle and thus increasing
30 the flow rate of the combined air flow, whereas when the primary air flow is inwardly
   tapering, the surface area of the outer profile is relatively low, decreasing the

                                                 9
   entrainment of the secondary air flow by the primary air flow and so decreasing the
   flow rate of the combined air flow. The inducement of a flow of air though the bore of
   the nozzle may also be impaired.
 5 Increasing the flow rate, as measured on a plane perpendicular to the bore axis and
   offset downstream from the plane of the air outlet, of the combined air flow generated
   by the nozzle - by changing the direction in which the air flow is emitted from the
   nozzle - has the effect of decreasing the maximum velocity of the combined air flow on
   this plane. This can make the nozzle suitable for generating a relatively diffuse flow of
10 air through a room or an office. On the other hand, decreasing the flow rate of the
   combined air flow generated by the nozzle has the effect of increasing the maximum
   velocity of the combined air flow. This can make the nozzle suitable for generating a
   flow of air for cooling rapidly a user located in front of the nozzle. The profile of the air
   flow generated by the nozzle can be rapidly switched between these two different
15 profiles through selectively enabling or inhibiting the passage of an air flow through the
   flow control chamber.
   The geometry of the air outlet(s) and the guide surface(s) may, at least in part, control
   the two different profiles for the air flow generated by the nozzle. For example, when
20 viewed in a cross-section along a plane passing through the bore axis and located
   generally midway between the upper and lower ends of the nozzle, the shape of the first
   guide surface may be different from the shape of the second guide surface.               For
   example, in this cross-section the angle subtended between the bore axis and the first
   guide surface may be smaller than the angle subtended between the bore axis and the
25 second guide surface.
   The control means preferably has a first state which inhibits a flow of air through the
   flow control port, and a second state which allows the flow of air through the flow
   control port. The control means may be in the form of a valve comprising a valve body
30 for occluding an air inlet of the flow control chamber, and an actuator for moving the
   valve body relative to the inlet. Alternatively, the valve body may be arranged to

                                                10
   occlude the flow control port. The valve may be a manually operable valve which is
   pushed, pulled or otherwise moved by a user between these two states.                In one
   embodiment, the actuator is driven by a motor. The motor is preferably driven by a
   controller or control circuit of the nozzle. This control circuit may be a main control
 5 circuit of the fan assembly. Alternatively, this control circuit may be a second control
   circuit connected to a main control circuit of the fan assembly. The main control circuit
   is preferably arranged to drive the motor in response to a signal received from a user
   interface of the fan assembly. This user interface may comprise a button or other user
   actuable member located on the body of the fan assembly which is actuated by a user to
10 drive the motor. Alternatively, or additionally, the fan assembly may comprise a remote
   control for transmitting a signal instructing the main control circuit to actuate the motor
   to change the state of the control means.
   The flow control chamber may have an air inlet located on an external surface of the
15 nozzle. In this case, all of the air flow received by the interior passage may be emitted
   from the air outlet(s).   However, the flow control chamber is preferably arranged to
   receive a flow control air flow from the interior passage. In this case, a first portion of
   the air flow received by the interior passage may be selectively allowed to enter the
   flow control chamber to form the flow control air flow, with the remainder of the air
20 flow being emitted from the interior passage through the air outlet(s) to recombine with
   the flow control air flow downstream from the air outlet(s).
   The interior passage may be separated from the flow control chamber by an internal
   wall of the nozzle.     This wall preferably includes the air inlet of the flow control
25 chamber. The air inlet of the flow control chamber is preferably located towards the
   base of the nozzle through which the air flow enters the nozzle.
   The flow control chamber may extend through the nozzle adjacent to the interior
   passage. Thus, the flow control chamber may extend at least partially about the bore of
30 the nozzle, and may surround the bore.

                                               11
   The interior passage may comprise means for heating at least part of the air flow
   received by the nozzle.
   In a third aspect, the present invention provides a fan assembly comprising an impeller,
 5 a motor for rotating the impeller to generate an air flow, a nozzle as aforementioned for
   receiving the air flow, and a controller for controlling the motor and for changing the
   state of the control means. The controller may be arranged to adjust the speed of the
   motor as the state of the control means is changed. For example, the motor controller
   may be arranged to reduce the speed of the motor when the state of the control means is
10 changed to produce a focused air flow, and to increase the speed of the motor when the
   state of the control means is changed to produce a diffuse air flow.
   Features described above in connection with the first aspect of the invention are equally
   applicable to each of the second and third aspects of the invention, and vice versa.

   mounted on the body 12. The nozzle 16 comprises air outlets 18 for emitting air from
   the fan assembly 10.
   The body 12 comprises a substantially cylindrical main body section 20 mounted on a
15 substantially cylindrical lower body section 22.       The main body section 20 and the
   lower body section 22 preferably have substantially the same external diameter so that
   the external surface of the main body section 20 is substantially flush with the external
   surface of the lower body section 22. The main body section 20 comprises the air inlet
   14 through which air enters the fan assembly 10. In this embodiment the air inlet 14
20 comprises an array of apertures formed in the main body section 20. Alternatively, the
   air inlet 14 may comprise one or more grilles or meshes mounted within windows
   formed in the main body section 20.
   Figure 2 illustrates a sectional view through the fan assembly 10.        The lower body
25 section 22 comprises a user interface of the fan assembly 10.           The user interface
   comprises a user operable actuator or button 24 to control various functions of the fan
   assembly 10, and a user interface control circuit 26 connected to the button 24. The fan
   assembly 10 may comprise a remote control (not shown) for transmitting control signals
   to the user interface circuit 26 of the fan assembly 10. In overview, the remote control
30 comprises a plurality of buttons which are depressible by the user, and a control unit for
   generating and transmitting infrared light signals in response to depression of one of the

                                                13
   buttons. The infrared light signals are emitted from a window located at one end of the
   remote control.    The control unit is powered by a battery located within a battery
   housing of the remote control. The user interface circuit 26 comprises a sensor or
   receiver 28 for receiving signals transmitted by the remote control, and a display 30 for
 5 displaying a current operational setting of the fan assembly 10.        For example, the
   display 30 may normally indicate a temperature setting selected by a user. The receiver
   28 and the display 30 may be located immediately behind a transparent or translucent
   part 32 of the outer wall of the lower body section 22. The lower body section 22 is
   mounted on a base 34 for engaging a surface on which the fan assembly 10 is located.
10 The base 34 includes an optional base plate 36.
   The lower body section 22 houses a main control circuit, indicated generally at 38,
   connected to the user interface circuit 26. In response to operation of the button 24 or
   the receipt of a signal from the remote control, the user interface circuit 26 is arranged
15 to transmit appropriate signals to the main control circuit 38 to control various
   operations of the fan assembly 10.
   The lower body section 22 also houses a mechanism, indicated generally at 40, for
   oscillating the lower body section 22 relative to the base 34. The operation of the
20 oscillating mechanism 40 is controlled by the main control circuit 38 in response to the
   user operation of one of the buttons of the remote control. The range of each oscillation
   cycle of the lower body section 22 relative to the base 34 is preferably between 600 and
   180', and in this embodiment is around 70'. A mains power cable 42 for supplying
   electrical power to the main control circuit 38 of the fan assembly 10 extends through
25 an aperture formed in the base 34.        The cable 42 is connected to a plug 44 for
   connection to a mains power supply.
   The main body section 20 comprises a duct 50 having a first end defining an air inlet 52
   of the duct 50 and a second end located opposite to the first end and defining an air
30 outlet 54 of the duct 50.     The duct 50 is aligned within the body 12 so that the

                                                 14
   longitudinal axis of the duct 50 is collinear with the longitudinal axis of the body 12,
   and so that the air inlet 52 is located beneath the air outlet 54.
   The duct 50 extends about an impeller 56 for drawing the primary air flow into the body
 5 12 of the fan assembly 10. The impeller 56 is a mixed flow impeller. The impeller 56
   comprises a generally conical hub, a plurality of impeller blades connected to the hub,
   and a generally frusto-conical shroud connected to the blades so as to surround the hub
   and the blades.    The blades are preferably integral with the hub, which is preferably
   formed from plastics material.
10
   The impeller 56 is connected to a rotary shaft 58 extending outwardly from a motor 60
   for driving the impeller 56 to rotate about a rotational axis which is collinear with the
   longitudinal axis of the duct 50. In this example, the motor 60 is a brushless DC motor
   having a speed which is variable by a brushless DC motor driver of the main control
15 circuit 38. The user may adjust the speed of the motor 60 using the button 24 or the
   remote control. In this example, the user is able to select one of ten different speed
   settings. The number of the current speed setting is displayed on the display 30 as the
   speed setting is changed by the user.
20 The motor 60 is housed within a motor housing.              The outer wall of the duct 50
   surrounds the motor housing, which provides an inner wall of the duct 50. The walls of
   the duct 50 thus define an annular air flow path which extends through the duct 50. The
   motor housing comprises a lower section 62 which supports the motor 60, and an upper
   section 64 connected to the lower section 62.          The shaft 58 protrudes through an
25 aperture formed in the lower section 62 of the motor housing to allow the impeller 56 to
   be connected to the shaft 58. The motor 60 is inserted into the lower section 62 of the
   motor housing before the upper section 64 is connected to the lower section 62. The
   lower section 62 of the motor housing is generally frusto-conical in shape, and tapers
   inwardly in a direction extending towards the air inlet 52 of the duct 50. The upper
30 section 64 of the motor housing is generally frusto-conical in shape, and tapers inwardly
   towards the air outlet 54 of the duct 50. An annular diffuser 66 is located between the

                                               15
   outer wall of the duct 50 and the upper section 64 of the motor housing. The diffuser 66
   comprises a plurality of blades for guiding the air flow towards the air outlet 54 of the
   duct 50. The shape of the blades is such that the air flow is also straightened as it passes
   through the diffuser 66. A cable for conveying electrical power from the main control
 5 circuit 38 to the motor 60 passes through the outer wall of the duct 50, the diffuser 66
   and the upper section 64 of the motor housing.       The upper section 64 of the motor
   housing is perforated, and the inner surface of the upper section 64 of the motor housing
   may be lined with noise absorbing material, preferably an acoustic foam material, to
   suppress broadband noise generated during operation of the fan assembly 10.
10
   The duct 50 is mounted on an annular seat 68 located within the body 12. The seat 68
   extends radially inwardly from the inner surface of the main body section 20 so that an
   upper surface of the seat 68 is substantially orthogonal to the rotational axis of the
   impeller 56. An annular seal 70 is located between the duct 50 and the seat 68. The
15 annular seal 70 is preferably a foam annular seal, and is preferably formed from a closed
   cell foam material.     The annular seal 70 has a lower surface which is in sealing
   engagement with the upper surface of the seat 68, and an upper surface which is in
   sealing engagement with the duct 50. The seat 68 comprises an aperture to enable the
   cable (not shown) to pass to the motor 60. The annular seal 70 is shaped to define a
20 recess to accommodate part of the cable.       One or more grommets or other sealing
   members may be provided about the cable to inhibit the leakage of air through the
   aperture, and between the recess and the internal surface of the main body section 20.
   With reference to Figure 3, the nozzle 16 has an annular shape. The nozzle 16 extends
25 about a bore axis X to define a bore 80 of the nozzle 16. In this example, the bore 80
   has a generally elongate shape, having a height (as measured in a direction extending
   from the upper end of the nozzle to the lower end of the nozzle 16) which is greater than
   the width of the nozzle 16 (as measured in a direction extending between the side walls
   of the nozzle 16). The nozzle 16 comprises a base 82 which is connected to the open
30 upper end of the main body section 20 of the body 12.

                                                16
   Figures 4 and 5 illustrate exploded views of the nozzle 16. The nozzle 16 comprises an
   annular rear casing section 84, an annular front casing section 86, and an annular air
   guiding section 88 located between the rear casing section 84 and the front casing
   section 86. While each of the front casing section 86 and the air guiding section 88 is
 5 illustrated here as being formed from a single component, one or more of these sections
   of the nozzle 16 may be formed from a plurality of components connected together, for
   example using an adhesive.
   The rear casing section 84 comprises an annular outer casing section 90 connected to
10 and extending about an annular inner casing section 92. Again, each of these sections
   may be formed from a plurality of connected parts, but in this embodiment each of the
   casing sections 90, 92 is formed from a respective, single moulded part. The outer
   casing section 90 comprises the base 82 of the nozzle 16. With reference also to
   Figures 6 and 7, the outer casing section 90 and the inner casing section 92 together
15 define an annular interior passage 94 of the nozzle 16. The interior passage 94 extends
   about the bore 80 of the nozzle 16, and thus comprises two relatively straight sections
   each adjacent a respective elongate side of the bore 80, an upper curved section joining
   the upper ends of the straight sections, and a lower curved section joining the lower
   ends of the straight sections. The interior passage 94 is bounded by the internal surface
20 96 of the outer casing section 90 and the internal surface 98 of the inner casing section
   92. The base 82 comprises an air inlet 100 through which air enters the lower curved
   section of the interior passage 94 from the body 12.
   The rear casing section 84 of the nozzle 16 houses a pair of heater assemblies 104.
25 Each heater assembly 104 comprises a row of heater elements 106 arranged side-by
   side.    The heater elements 106 are preferably formed from positive temperature
   coefficient (PTC) ceramic material. The row of heater elements is sandwiched between
   two heat radiating components 108, each of which comprises an array of heat radiating
   fins located within a frame. The heat radiating components 108 are preferably formed
30 from aluminium or other material with high thermal conductivity (around 200 to 400
   W/mK), and may be attached to the row of heater elements 106 using beads of silicone

                                               17
   adhesive, or by a clamping mechanism. The side surfaces of the heater elements 106
   are preferably at least partially covered with a metallic film to provide an electrical
   contact between the heater elements 106 and the heat radiating components 108. This
   film may be formed from screen printed or sputtered aluminium. Electrical terminals
 5 located at the ends of the heater assemblies 104 are connected to a loom 110 for
   supplying electrical power to the heater assemblies 104.       The loom 110 is in turn
   connected to a heater control circuit 112 located in the base 82 of the nozzle 16 for
   activating the heater assemblies 104. The heater control circuit 112 is in turn controlled
   by control signals supplied thereto by the main control circuit 38. The heater control
10 circuit 112 comprises two triac circuits to control the heater elements 106 of the heater
   assemblies 104.    A thermistor for providing an indication of the temperature of air
   entering the fan assembly 10 is connected to the heater control circuit 112.          The
   thermistor may be located immediately behind the air inlet 14, but preferably it is
   located within the base 82 of the nozzle 16 so as to be connected readily to the heater
15 control circuit 112.    A thermal fuse and, optionally, a thermal cut out are located
   electrically between each heater assembly 104 and the heater control circuit 112.
   The user may set a desired room temperature or temperature setting by pressing a button
   of the remote control. Depending on the current operational mode of the fan assembly
20 10, as discussed in more detail below, the user interface control circuit 26 may display a
   temperature currently selected by the user on the display 30, which temperature may
   correspond to a desired room air temperature. As the user changes the speed setting for
   the motor 60, the user interface control circuit 26 may display temporarily the speed
   setting currently selected by the user on the display 30 for a brief period of time, for
25 example a few seconds, before returning to the display of the temperature selected by
   the user.
   The heater assemblies 104 are each retained within a respective straight section of the
   interior passage 94 by a chassis 120.      The chassis 120 comprises a pair of heater
30 housings into which the heater assemblies 104 are inserted. The heater housings are
   defined by a pair of elongate inner walls 122 of an annular body 124, and a pair of

                                               18
   elongate outer walls 126 which are each connected to a respective elongate inner wall
   122, for example by using screws. The inner walls 122 are connected together by upper
   and lower curved portions 128, 130 of the annular body 124. The walls 122, 126 are
   shaped so that the heater housings are open at the front and rear ends thereof. The walls
 5 122, 126 thus define two first air flow channels 132 within the interior passage 94.
   The rear end of the inner casing section 92 comprises upper and lower curved flanges
   134, 136. Each flange 134, 136 is shaped to retain a respective curved sealing member
   138, 140. Each sealing member 138, 140 is arranged to engage a respective U-shaped
10 protrusion 142, 144 extending forwardly from the upper and lower sections of the rear
   ends of the outer casing section 90 to form a seal therewith. During assembly of the
   nozzle 16, the annular body 124 is pushed over the rear end of the outer casing section
   90 so that each curved portion 128, 130 of the annular body 124 engages a respective
   flange 134, 136. The sealing members 138, 140 are then pushed into the flanges 134,
15 136 so that the curved portions 128, 130 of the annular body 124 are sandwiched
   between the outer casing section 90 and the sealing members 138, 140. This is shown
   in Figure 2. Returning to Figure 7, the inner walls 122 of the chassis 120 are shaped so
   that the rear ends 146 of the inner walls 122 wrap around the rear ends 148 of the
   elongate sections of the inner casing section 92. The inner surface 98 of the inner
20 casing section 92 comprises a first set of raised spacers 150 which engage the inner
   walls 122 to space the inner walls 122 from the inner surface 98 of the inner casing
   section 92. The rear ends 146 of the inner walls 122 comprise a second set of spacers
   152 which engage the external surface 154 of the inner casing section 92 to space the
   rear ends 146 of the inner walls 122 from the external surface 154 of the inner casing
25 section 92.
   The inner walls 122 of the chassis 120 and the inner casing section 92 thus define two
   second air flow channels 156 within the interior passage 94. Each of the second flow
   channels 156 extends along the inner surface 98 of the inner casing section 92, and
30 around the rear end 146 of the inner casing section 92. Each second flow channel 156 is
   separated from a respective first flow channel 128 by an inner wall 122 of the chassis

                                               19
   120. Each second flow channel 156 terminates at an air outlet 158 located between the
   external surface 154 of the inner casing section 92 and the rear end 146 of the inner wall
   122. Each air outlet 158 is thus in the form of a vertically-extending slot located on a
   respective side of the bore 80 of the assembled nozzle 16.           Each air outlet 158
 5 preferably has a width in the range from 0.5 to 5 mm, and in this example the air outlets
   158 have a width of around 1 mm.
   With the annular body 124 of the chassis 120 connected to the inner casing section 92,
   the heater assemblies 104 are placed along the inner walls 122 of the chassis 120 so that
10 lugs 160 located at the upper end of each heater assembly 104 are received within a
   respective housing 162 formed on the annular body 124. This serves to locate the
   heater assemblies 104 generally relative to the annular body 124 before the outer walls
   126 are connected to the inner walls 122 to retain the heater assemblies 104 within the
   heater housings defined by the chassis 120. Each of the inner walls 122 and the outer
15 walls 126 comprises a set of ribs 164, 166 which serve to space the heater assemblies
   104 from the inner surfaces of the heater housings. This allows air to pass both through
   the heat radiating components 108 of the heater assemblies 104 and around the heater
   assemblies 104 as it passes through the first air flow channels 132. The loom 110 is
   then connected to the heater assemblies 104, and the heater control circuit 112 is
20 connected to the loom 110. The heater control circuit 112 may be supported in a stable
   position by the inner casing section 92. With reference to Figures 8 and 9, the heater
   control circuit 112 may be connected to the inner casing section 92 using screws 168
   which are inserted through holes formed in a printed circuit board of the heater control
   circuit 112 and received within bosses 170 formed in the inner casing section 92.
25
   The inner casing section 92 of the nozzle 16 is then inserted into the outer casing
   section 90 of the nozzle 16. The outer casing section 90 is shaped so that part of the
   inner surface 96 of the outer casing section 90 extends around the outer walls 126 of the
   chassis 120. The outer walls 126 have a front end 172 and a rear end 174, and a third
30 set of spacers 176 located on the outer side surfaces of the outer walls 126 and which
   extend between the ends 172, 174 of the outer walls 126.            The spacers 176 are

                                               20
   configured to engage the inner surface 96 of the outer casing section 90 to space the
   outer walls 126 from the inner surface 96 of the outer casing section 90.         The outer
   walls 126 of the chassis 120 and the outer casing section 90 thus define two third air
   flow channels 178 within the interior passage 94. Each of the third flow channels 178 is
 5 located adjacent and extends along the inner surface 96 of the outer casing section 90.
   Each third flow channel 178 is separated from a respective first flow channel 128 by an
   outer wall 126 of the chassis 120. Each third flow channel 178 terminates at an air
   outlet 180 located within the interior passage 94, between the rear end 174 of the outer
   wall 126 of the chassis 120 and the outer casing section 90. Each air outlet 180 is also
10 in the form of a vertically-extending slot, located within the interior passage 94 of the
   nozzle 16, and preferably has a width in the range from 0.5 to 5 mm. In this example the
   air outlets 180 have a width of around 1 mm.
   The outer casing section 90 is shaped so as to curve inwardly around part of the rear
15 ends 146 of the inner walls 122 of the chassis 120. The rear ends 146 of the inner walls
   122 comprise a fourth set of spacers 182 located on the opposite side of the inner walls
   122 to the second set of spacers 152, and which are arranged to engage the inner surface
   96 of the outer casing section 90 to space the rear ends 146 of the inner walls 122 from
   the inner surface 96 of the outer casing section 90. The outer casing section 90 and the
20 rear ends 146 of the inner walls 122 thus define a further two air outlets 184. Each air
   outlet 184 is located adjacent a respective one of the air outlets 158, with each air outlet
   158 being located between a respective air outlet 184 and the external surface 154 of the
   inner casing section 92. Similar to the air outlets 158, each air outlet 184 is in the form
   of a vertically-extending slot located on a respective side of the bore 80 of the
25 assembled nozzle 16. The air outlets 184 preferably have the same length as the air
   outlets 158. Each air outlet 184 preferably has a width in the range from 0.5 to 5 mm,
   and in this example the air outlets 184 have a width of around 2 to 3 mm. Thus, the air
   outlets 18 for emitting air from the fan assembly 10 comprise the two air outlets 158
   and the two air outlets 184. As mentioned above, the outer casing section 90 comprises
30 a pair of curved protrusions 142, 144 which each engage a respective sealing member

                                               21
   138, 140 to inhibit the emission of air from the upper and lower curved sections of the
   interior passage 94.
   Returning to Figures 2 to 4, the external surface 154 of the inner casing section 92
 5 comprises a convex Coanda surface 190 located adjacent the air outlets 18, and over
   which the air outlets 18 are arranged to direct the air emitted therefrom. The external
   surface 154 of the inner casing section 92 further comprises a diffuser surface 192
   located downstream of the Coanda surface 190. The diffuser surface 192 is arranged to
   taper away from the bore axis X of the bore 80 in a direction extending from the air
10 outlets 18 towards the front of the nozzle 16. An angle subtended between the diffuser
   surface 192 and the bore axis X of the bore 80 - as viewed in a horizontal plane passing
   through and containing the bore axis X - is in the range between 0 and 250, and in this
   example is around 5'.
15 The inner casing section 92 includes an outwardly flared front surface 194 connected to
   the diffuser surface 192. The air guiding section 88 of the nozzle 16 is connected to the
   front surface 194 of the inner casing section 92.      In this example, the inner casing
   section 92 comprises a set of pins 198 spaced about the front surface 194, and the air
   guiding section 88 comprises a set of apertures 196 similarly spaced about the outer
20 periphery of the air guiding section 88. During assembly, the air guiding section 88 is
   pushed on to the front surface 194 of the inner casing section 92 so that the pins 198
   enter the apertures 196 to guide the location of the air guiding section 88 on to the rear
   casing section 84. As shown in Figure 7, the rear end 200 of the air guiding section 88
   enters a recess 202 located on the front surface 194 of the inner casing section 92 as the
25 air guiding section 88 is pushed on to the rear casing section 84. When the air guiding
   section 88 is pushed fully on to the rear casing section 84, a front section 204 of the air
   guiding section 88 protrudes forwardly from the front surface 194 of the inner casing
   section 92. This front section 204 of the air guiding section 88 comprises an annular
   guide surface 206 which is located downstream from, and contiguous with, the diffuser
30 surface 192 of the inner casing section 92. The guide surface 206 is arranged to taper
   towards the bore axis X of the bore 80 in a direction extending from the air outlets 18

                                                22
   towards the front of the nozzle 16. The angle subtended between the guide surface 206
   and the bore axis X of the bore 80 - as viewed in a horizontal plane passing through and
   containing the bore axis X - is in the range between 0 and -25', and in this example is
   around -10'.
 5
   Following the attachment of the air guiding section 88 to the rear casing section 84, the
   front casing section 86 is pushed on to the front of the rear casing section 84. The inner
   surface of the front casing section 86 is shaped to define a first annular recess 210 which
   receives both the front end 212 of the outer casing section 90 and the front end 214 of
10 the inner casing section 92. An adhesive may be supplied to the recess 210 to secure
   the front casing section 86 to the rear casing section 84. The inner surface of the front
   casing section 86 is also shaped to define a second annular recess 216 which receives
   curved protrusions 218, 219 extending forwardly from the upper end and the lower end
   respectively of the air guiding section 88. Again, an adhesive may be supplied to the
15 recess 216 to secure the front casing section 86 to the air guiding section 88.
   In addition to the interior passage 94, the nozzle 16 defines a flow control chamber 220.
   The flow control chamber 220 is annular in shape and extends about the bore 80 of the
   nozzle 16.    The flow control chamber 220 thus comprises two relatively straight
20 sections each adjacent a respective elongate side of the bore 80, an upper curved section
   joining the upper ends of the straight sections, and a lower curved section joining the
   lower ends of the straight sections. The flow control chamber 220 is bounded by the
   front surface 194 of the inner casing section 92, the internal surface 222 of the air
   guiding section 88 and the internal surface 224 of the front casing section 86.
25
   The flow control chamber 220 is arranged to convey air to two flow control ports 226
   for emitting air from the straight sections of the flow control chamber 220.            The
   engagement between the recess 216 of the front casing section 86 and the curved
   protrusions 218, 219 of the air guiding section 88 inhibits the emission of air from the
30 curved sections of the flow control chamber 220. The flow control ports 226 are located
   immediately downstream from the guide surface 206. Each flow control port 226 is in

                                                23
   the form of a vertically-extending slot located on a respective side of the bore 80 of the
   assembled nozzle 16. The flow control ports 226 preferably have the same length as the
   air outlets 18. Each flow control port 226 preferably has a width in the range from 0.5
   to 5 mm, and in this example the flow control ports 226 have a width of around 1 mm.
 5
   The flow control ports 226 are located between the internal surface 222 of the front
   section 204 of the air guiding section 88 and the external surface 228 of the front casing
   section 86. A fifth set of spacers 230 is provided on the front casing section 86 and
   arranged to engage the inner surface 96 of the outer casing section 90 to space the
10 internal surface 222 of the front section 204 of the air guiding section 88 from the
   external surface 228 of the front casing section 86 in the vicinity of the flow control
   ports 226.
   The flow control ports 226 are arranged to direct air over the external surface 228 of the
15 front casing section 86. The external surface 228 comprises a convex Coanda surface
   232 located adjacent the flow control ports 226, and over which the flow control ports
   226 are arranged to direct the air emitted therefrom. The external surface 228 of the
   front casing section 86 further comprises a diffuser surface 234 located downstream of
   the Coanda surface 232. The diffuser surface 234 is arranged to taper away from the
20 bore axis X of the bore 80 in a direction extending from the flow control ports 226
   towards the front of the nozzle 16. An angle subtended between the diffuser surface
   234 and the bore axis X of the bore 80 - as viewed in a horizontal plane passing through
   and containing the bore axis X - is in the range between 20 and 700, and in this example
   is around 450.
25
   With reference now to Figures 4, 5, 8 and 9, air enters the flow control chamber 220
   through one or more air inlets 236 formed in the front surface 194 of the inner casing
   section 92. In this example, the flow control chamber 220 has two air inlets 236. The
   air inlets 236 are arranged to receive air from the lower curved section of the interior
30 passage 94. The nozzle 16 includes a control mechanism 240 for controlling the flow of
   air through the flow control chamber 220. In this example, the control mechanism 240

                                                24
   is arranged to selectively inhibit the flow of air through the flow control chamber 220.
   In other words, the control mechanism 240 has a first state, in which the control
   mechanism 240 is arranged to inhibit the flow of air through the flow control chamber
   220 so that there is substantially no air emitted from the flow control ports 226, and a
 5 second state, in which the control mechanism 240 is arranged to allow the flow of air
   through the flow control chamber 220 so that air is emitted simultaneously from both of
   the flow control ports 226.
   The control mechanism 240 comprises a valve body 242.             The valve body 242 is
10 moveable relative to the nozzle 16 as the control mechanism 240 toggles between the
   first state and the second state. In this example, the valve body 242 comprises a pair of
   valves 244 for occluding the air inlets 236 to inhibit the flow of air through the flow
   control chamber 220 when the control mechanism 240 is in the first state. The valves
   244 are arranged to engage annular seals 246 attached to the internal surface of the front
15 surface 194 of the inner casing section 92 which prevent air leaking to the air inlets 236
   from between the valves 244 and the internal surface of the inner casing section 92
   when the control mechanism 240 is in the first state.
   The valve body 242 is connected to the inner casing section 92 for movement relative to
20 the nozzle 16. The valve body 242 comprises a pair of fingers 248 at opposite ends
   thereof, with the end of each finger 248 being received within a housing 250 formed in
   the internal surface of the front surface 194 of the inner casing section 92. The valve
   body 242 is thus pivotable relative to the nozzle 16 about a pivot axis which passes
   through the ends of the fingers 248. The control mechanism 240 comprises an actuator
25 252 for moving the valve body 242 relative to the nozzle 16. The actuator 252 is in the
   form of a wire which has one end connected to the valve body 242 and another end
   connected to a motor 254 for actuating movement of the actuator 252. The motor 254 is
   driven by the heater control circuit 112, in response to a signal received from the main
   control circuit 38.    As described in more detail below, the main control circuit 38
30 controls the actuation of the motor 254 in response to the reception by the user interface
   circuit 26 of a signal generated by the remote control.

                                               25
   The motor 254 is driven in different directions as the control mechanism 240 toggles
   between the first state and the second state. When the motor 254 is driven in a first
   direction to place the control mechanism 240 in the first state, the actuator 252 pivots
   the valve body 242 in a first angular direction to move the valves 244 towards the front
 5 surface 194 of the inner casing section 92 to occlude the air inlets 236. When the motor
   is driven in a second direction opposite to the first direction, the actuator 252 pivots the
   valve body 242 in a second angular direction, opposite to the first angular direction, to
   move the valves 244 away from the front surface 194 of the inner casing section 92 to
   open the air inlets 236.
10
   In this example, the fan assembly 10 is operable in three different operational modes. In
   a first operational mode, which may be referred to as a fan mode, the heating assemblies
   104 are not activated and the control mechanism 240 is placed in the first state. In a
   second operational mode, which may be referred to as a spot heating mode, the heating
15 assemblies 104 are activated and the control mechanism 240 is placed in the first state.
   In a third operational state, which may be referred to as a room heating mode, the
   heating assemblies 104 are activated and the control mechanism 240 is placed in the
   second state.    Each of these operational modes may be selected by a user during
   operation of the fan assembly 10 by pressing one or more of the buttons on the remote
20 control.     The user interface circuit 26 may comprise a number of LEDs which are
   illuminated in a different manner by the user interface circuit 26 depending on the
   currently selected operational mode.
   The fan assembly 10 is switched on and off either by depressing the button 24 or by
25 depressing a dedicated button on the remote control.         When the fan assembly 10 is
   switched off, the main control circuit 38 stores the current user selected operational
   parameters, which include the current operational mode of the fan assembly 10, the
   current user selected speed setting of the motor 60 and - if the fan assembly 10 is in
   either the second or third operational mode - the current temperature selected by the
30 user. When the fan assembly 10 is next switched on, the fan assembly 10 is operated
   using those stored operational parameters.

                                                26
   If, for example, the fan assembly 10 is switched on following a previous operation of
   the fan assembly 10 in the fan mode, the main control circuit 38 selects the rotational
   speed of the motor 60 from a first range of values, an example of which is listed below.
   Each value within the first range of values is associated with a respective one of the user
 5 selectable speed settings.

   Initially, the speed which is selected by the main control circuit 38 corresponds to the
   speed setting which had been selected by the user when the fan assembly 10 was
   previously switched off. For example, if the user had selected speed setting 7, the
10 motor 60 is rotated at 7,600 rpm, and the number "7" is displayed on the display 30. As
   the user selects a different speed setting, the current speed setting is displayed on the
   display 30.
   The motor 60 rotates the impeller 56 to cause a primary air flow to enter the body 12
15 through the air inlet 14, and to pass to the air inlet 52 of the duct 50. The air flow
   passes through the duct 50 and is guided by the shaped peripheral surface of the air
   outlet 54 of the duct 50 into the lower curved section of the interior passage 94 of the
   nozzle 16. Within the lower curved section of the interior passage 94, the primary air
   flow is divided into two air streams which pass in opposite directions around the bore
20 80 of the nozzle 16. One of the air streams enters the straight section of the interior

                                               27
   passage 94 located to one side of the bore 80, whereas the other air stream enters the
   straight section of the interior passage 94 located on the other side of the bore 80. As
   the air streams pass through the straight sections of the interior passage 94, each air
   stream turns through around 900, and passes through the flow channels 128, 156, 178
 5 defined by the chassis 120 towards a respective air outlet 18 of the nozzle 16.
   The primary air flow emitted from the air outlets 18 passes, in turn, over the Coanda
   surface 190 defined by the rear casing section 84 of the nozzle 16, over the diffuser
   surface 192 defined by the rear casing section 84 of the nozzle 16, and finally over the
10 guide surface 206 defined by the air guiding section 88 of the nozzle 16.           As the
   primary air flow passes over these surfaces, it attaches to these surfaces and so the
   profile and the direction of the primary air flow as it is emitted from the nozzle 16 then
   depends on the shape of the guide surface 206. As mentioned above, in this example
   the guide surface 206 tapers inwardly towards the bore axis X of the nozzle 16 and so
15 the primary air flow is emitted from the nozzle 16 with a profile which also tapers
   inwardly towards the bore axis X.
   The emission of the air flow from the air outlets 18 causes a secondary air flow to be
   generated by the entrainment of air from the external environment. Air is drawn into
20 the air flow through the bore 80 of the nozzle 16, and from the environment both around
   and in front of the nozzle 16.      This secondary air flow combines with the air flow
   emitted from the nozzle 16 to produce a combined, or total, air flow, or air current,
   projected forward from the fan assembly 10.         With the air flow tapering inwardly
   towards the bore axis X, the surface area of its outer profile is relatively low, which in
25 turn results in a relatively low entrainment of air from the region in front of the nozzle
   16 and a relatively low flow rate of air through the bore 80 of the nozzle 16, and so the
   combined air flow generated by the fan assembly 10 has a relatively low flow rate.
   However, for a given flow rate of a primary air flow generated by the impeller,
   decreasing the flow rate of the combined air flow generated by the fan assembly 10 is
30 associated with an increase in the maximum velocity of the combined air flow
   experienced on a fixed plane located downstream from the nozzle. Together with the

                                                28
   direction of the air flow towards the bore axis X, this makes the combined air flow
   suitable for cooling rapidly a user located in front of the fan assembly 10. The user may
   actuate the oscillating mechanism 40, through depressing a dedicated button on the
   remote control, to cause the nozzle 16 to oscillate the direction in which the combined
 5 air flow is projected forward from the fan assembly 10.
   If the user depresses a button on the remote control for placing the fan assembly 10 in
   the second operational mode, or spot heating mode, the remote control generates and
   transmits an infrared light signal containing data which is indicative of this action. The
10 signal is received by the receiver 28 of the user interface circuit 26, which
   communicates the receipt of this signal to the main control circuit 38 to place the fan
   assembly 10 in the second operational mode. When in this second operational mode,
   the main control circuit 38 compares the temperature, Ts, previously selected by the user
   with the temperature Ta, of the air within or passing though the fan assembly 10, as
15 detected by the thermistor and provided to the main control circuit 38 by the heater
   control circuit 112. When Ta<Ts, the main control circuit 38 instructs the heater control
   circuit 112 to activate the heater assemblies 104.
   In this second operational mode, the main control circuit 38 selects the rotational speed
20 of the motor 60 from a second range of values, an example of which is listed below.
   Again, each value within the second range of values is associated with a respective one
   of the user selectable speed settings.

   In general, for the majority of the speed settings selectable by the user, the associated
   rotational speed of the motor 60 is lower in the second range of values than it is in the
   first range of values to avoid the undesirable creation of a draught within the localised
 5 environment to be heated by the fan assembly 10. For example, if the user had selected
   speed setting 7, the rotational speed of the motor 60 is decreased from 7,600 rpm to
   6,150 rpm as the fan assembly 10 switches from the first operational mode to the second
   operational mode.
10 As mentioned above, as the air streams pass through the straight sections of the interior
   passage 94 each air stream passes through the flow channels 128, 156, 178 defined by
   the chassis 120 towards a respective air outlet 18 of the nozzle 16. A first portion of
   each air stream passes through a first flow channel 128, a second portion of each air
   stream passes through a second flow channel 156, and a third portion of each air stream
15 passes through a third flow channel 178. When the heater assemblies 104 are activated,
   the heat generated by the activated heating assemblies 104 is transferred by convection
   to the first portions of the primary air flow to raise the temperature of the first portions
   of the primary air flow. The second portions of the primary air flow pass along the
   internal surface 98 of the inner casing section 92, thereby acting as a thermal barrier
20 between the relatively hot first portions of the primary air flow and the inner casing
   section 92. The third portions of the primary air flow pass along the internal surface 96
   of the outer casing section 90, thereby acting as a thermal barrier between the relatively
   hot first portions of the primary air flow and the outer casing section 90.
25 The third air flow channels 178 are arranged to convey the third portions of the primary
   air flow to the air outlets 180 located within the interior passage 94. Upon emission
   from the air outlets 180, the third portions of the primary air flow merge with the first

                                                30
   portions of the primary air flow. These merged portions of the primary air flow are
   conveyed between the internal surface 96 of the outer casing section 88 and the inner
   walls 122 of the heater housings to the air outlets 184. The air outlets 184 are arranged
   to direct the relatively hot, merged first and third portions of the primary air flow over
 5 the relatively cold second portions of the primary air flow emitted from the air outlets
   158, which acts as a thermal barrier between the outer surface 92 of the inner casing
   section 90 and the relatively hot air emitted from the air outlets 184. Consequently, the
   majority of the internal and external surfaces of the nozzle 16 are shielded from the
   relatively hot air generated by the fan assembly 10.
10
   When operating in this second operational mode, the profile of the combined air flow
   generated by the fan assembly 10 is substantially the same as that generated during the
   operation of the fan assembly 10 in the first operational mode. As the temperature of
   the air in the external environment increases, the temperature of the primary air flow
15 drawn into the fan assembly 10 through the air inlet 14, Ta, also increases. A signal
   indicative of the temperature of this primary air flow is output from the thermistor to the
   heater control circuit 112. When Ta has risen to 1C above Ts, the heater control circuit
   112 de-activates the heater assemblies 104 and the main control circuit 38 reduces the
   rotational speed of the motor 60 to 1,000 rpm. When the temperature of the primary air
20 flow has fallen to a temperature around 1C below Ts, the heater control circuit 112 re
   activates the heater assemblies 104 and the main control circuit 38 returns the speed of
   the motor 60 to that associated with the currently selected speed setting.
   If the user now depresses a button on the remote control for placing the fan assembly 10
25 in the third operational mode, or room heating mode, the remote control generates and
   transmits an infrared light signal containing data which is indicative of this action. The
   signal is received by the receiver 28 of the user interface circuit 26, which
   communicates the receipt of this signal to the main control circuit 38 to place the fan
   assembly 10 in the third operational mode. When in this third operational mode, the
30 main control circuit 38 selects the rotational speed of the motor 60 from a third range of

                                               31
   values, an example of which is listed below. Again, each value within the third range of
   values is associated with a respective one of the user selectable speed settings.

   In general, for the majority of the speed settings selectable by the user, the associated
   rotational speed of the motor 60 is higher in the third range of values than it is in the
10 second range of values to increase the velocity and the flow rate of a combined air flow
   generated by the fan assembly 10, and so promote a more rapid heating of the room or
   other location in which the fan assembly 10 is located. For example, if the user had
   selected speed setting 7, the rotational speed of the motor 60 is increased from
   6,150 rpm to 7,200 rpm as the fan assembly 10 switches from the second operational
15 mode to the third operational mode.
   In this third operational mode, the main control circuit 38 instructs the heater control
   circuit 112 to drive the motor 254 in the second direction to place the control
   mechanism 240 in its second state. This actuates the actuator 252 to pivot the valve
20 body 242 in the second angular direction to move the valves 244 away from the front

                                               32
   surface 194 of the inner casing section 92 to open the air inlets 236 of the flow control
   chamber 220. With the control mechanism 240 in this second state, a first portion of the
   air flow passes through the air inlets 236 from the lower curved section of the interior
   passage 94 to form a flow control air flow which passes through the flow control
 5 chamber 220. A second portion of the air flow remains within the interior passage 94,
   wherein, as described above, it is divided into the two air streams which pass in
   opposite directions around the bore 80 of the nozzle 16. The proportion of the air flow
   which enters the flow control chamber 220 is preferably in the range from 5 to 30%, and
   in this example is around 20%.
10
   Within the flow control chamber 220, the flow control air flow is divided into two air
   streams which also pass in opposite directions around the bore 80 of the nozzle 16. As
   in the interior passage 94, each of these air streams enters a respective one of the two
   straight sections of the flow control chamber 220, and is conveyed in a substantially
15 vertical direction up through each of these sections towards the upper curved section of
   the flow control chamber 220. As these air streams pass through the straight sections of
   the flow control chamber 220, air is emitted from the flow control ports 226. The flow
   control air flow emitted from the flow control ports 226 passes, in turn, over the Coanda
   surface 232 defined by the front casing section 86 of the nozzle 16, and over the diffuser
20 surface 234 defined by the front casing section 86 of the nozzle 16.
   As the flow control air flow passes over these surfaces, it attaches to these surfaces 232,
   234 to generate a relatively low pressure adjacent to the end of the front section 204 of
   the air guiding section 88. This in turn generates a pressure differential across each of
25 the air streams emitted from the air outlets 18 of the nozzle 16, which are each passing
   over the external guide surface 206 defined by the front section 204 of the air guiding
   section 88.    The pressure differential thus created across the air streams generates a
   force which urges the air streams towards the external surface 228 of the front casing
   section 86, which results in the air streams becoming attached to the external surface
30 228 of the front casing section 86 and merging with the flow control air flow to re-form
   the primary air flow.

                                                33
   As mentioned above, the diffuser surface 234 of the front casing section 86 tapers away
   from the bore axis X of the nozzle 16, and so the air flow is emitted from the nozzle 16
   with a profile which tapers outwardly away from the bore axis X. With the air flow
   now tapering outwardly away from the bore axis X, the surface area of its outer profile
 5 is relatively large, which in turn results in a relatively high entrainment of air from the
   region in front of the nozzle 16 and so, for a given flow rate of air generated by the
   impeller, the combined air flow generated by the fan assembly 10 has a relatively high
   flow rate. Thus, placing the control mechanism 240 in its second state has the result of
   the fan assembly 10 generating a relatively wide, heated flow of air through a room or
10 an office.
   If subsequently the user selects either the fan mode or the spot heating mode, the main
   control circuit 38 instructs the heater control circuit 112 to drive the motor 254 in the
   first direction to return the control mechanism 240 to its first state. This actuates the
15 actuator 252 to pivot the valve body 242 in the first angular direction to move the valves
   244 towards the front surface 194 of the inner casing section 92 to occlude the air inlets
   236 of the flow control chamber 220. As the passage of the air through the flow control
   chamber 220 is now inhibited by the flow control mechanism 240 the pressure
   differential across the air streams emitted from the air outlets 18 is removed. This
20 causes the air streams to detach from the external surface 228 of the front casing section
   86, and return the profile of the primary air flow emitted from the nozzle 16 to one
   which tapers inwardly towards the bore axis X.
   In summary, a nozzle for a fan assembly includes an air inlet, an air outlet, an interior
25 passage for conveying air from the air inlet to the air outlet, an annular inner wall, and
   an outer wall extending about the inner wall. The interior passage is located between
   the inner wall and the outer wall. The inner wall at least partially defines a bore through
   which air from outside the nozzle is drawn by air emitted from the air outlet. The air
   outlet is arranged to direct air over an external surface of the nozzle. A flow control
30 port is located downstream from that surface. A flow control chamber is provided for

                                             34
conveying air to the flow control port. A control mechanism selectively enables a flow
of air through the flow control port to deflect an air flow emitted from the air outlet.
