                                            DESCRIPTION
             POLYCLONAL GAMMA DELTA T CELLS FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY
             [0001] The present application claims the priority benefit of United States provisional
    application number 61/895,626, filed October 25, 2013, and is a divisional of AU
  5 2014339926, which is a national phase of PCT/US2014/062191 (WO 2015/061694), the
    entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.
              [0002] The invention was made with government support under Grant No. 10626252
     awarded by the Department of Defense. The government has certain rights in the invention.
                                BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 0           1.      Field of the Invention
             [00031 The present invention relates generally to the fields of medicine and
    immunology. In certain aspects, the field of the invention concerns immunotherapy. More
    particularly, it concerns the manufacture of clinical-grade polyclonal 76 T cells and
    therapeutic methods using such cells.
  5          2.      Description of Related Art
             [0004] Human 76 T cells have both innate and adaptive qualities exhibiting a range of
    effector    functions, including cytolysis upon cell contact (Bonneville         et al., 2010).
    Recognition and subsequent killing of tumor target cells is achieved by heterodimers of y and
    6 T-cell receptor (TCR) chains. The human TCR variable (V) region defines 14 unique Vy
 '0 alleles, 3 unique V6 alleles (V61, V62, and V63), and 5 V6 alleles that share a common
    nomenclature      with Va alleles (V64/VaI4,       V65/Va29,     V66/Va23,     V67/Va36,     and
    V68/Va38-2) (Lefranc, 2001). T cells expressing TCRa/TCRP heterodimers compose
    approximately 95% of peripheral blood (PB) T cells and recognize peptides in the context of
    major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (Turchinovich and Pennington, 2011).
25  In contrast, TCRy6 ligands are recognized independent of MHC restriction but are infrequent
    (1%-5% of T cells) in PB (Bonneville et al., 2010; Kabelitz et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2011).
             [0005] Human y6 T cells exhibit an inherent ability to lyse tumor cells and hold
    promise for immunotherapy. As such, many TCRy6 ligands are present on cancer cells,
    raising the possibility that an expansion approach that maintains a polyclonal repertoire of y6
30  TCRs has appeal for human application. Adoptive transfer of V7 9V62 T cells has yielded
                                                    -I -

   WO 2015/061694                                                                PCT/US2014/062191
   objective clinical responses for investigational treatment of cancer, but administration of non
   V7 9V62 T cells has yet to be performed (Kondo et al., 2008; Lang et al., 2011; Nagamine et
   al., 2009; Nicol et al., 2011; Wilhelm et al., 2003). Long-term remissions of leukemia among
   recipients of haploidentical a       T cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
 5 correlated with increased engraftment frequency of donor-derived V61 T cells (Godder et al.,
   2007; Lamb et al., 1999; Lamb et al., 1996; Lamb et al., 2001). No reports to date have
   described the therapeutic impact of V6l eVS2 eg T cells and this subset has not been directly
   compared to T cells expressing V61 and V62 TCRs. Thus, there are significant gaps in the
   knowledge and human application of non-Vy9V62 lineages.
10         [0006] Aminobisphosphonates, e.g., zoledronic acid (Zol), have been used to
   propagate the V7 9V62 subset of y6 T cells for clinical use (Stresing et al., 2007; Thompson et
   al., 2010). Other y6 T cell lineages are not propagated by aminobisphosphonates.
   Nonetheless, clinical trials that have used V7 9V62 y6 T cells as cancer immunotherapies have
   shown some objective responses but were not curative as a single therapy (Nicol et al., 2011;
15 Wilhelm et al., 2003). Plate-bound antibodies and cytokine cocktails have also been used to
   propagate a more diverse set of y6 T cells, but (i) they did not achieve consistent V61 and
   V negV 6   2neg frequencies, (ii) the absolute numbers of y6 T cells were not clinically-relevant
   (<108 cells), (iii) they did not comprehensively analyze Vy frequencies, and (iv) they are not
   as directly translatable to the clinic as these reagents are not all available at good
20 manufacturing practices (GMP) quality (Dokouhaki et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2009; Lopez et
   al., 2000). Therefore, clinically-relevant methods of expanding 76 T cells ex vivo, and the
   cells produced thereby, are greatly needed.
                                 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
           [0007] Provided herein is a method of expanding clinically-relevant quantities of
25 polyclonal 76 T cells that have anti-tumor, anti-viral, and anti-bacterial reactivity. y6 T cells
   can target a variety of tumors, including solid tumors as well as other conditions, such as viral
   and bacterial infections.
           [0008] In one embodiment, a cell composition is provided comprising at least about
   109 purified  76 T cells. The cell composition may comprise at least about 109,      1010, 1011 or
30 more purified 76 T cells. In one aspect, the purified 76 T cells may be of the V61, V62, and
   V6l"gV62"n       TCR subsets.       In one aspect, the purified 76 T cells may express any
                                                      -2-

    WO 2015/061694                                                              PCT/US2014/062191
   combination of a V61, V62, V63, V65, V67, or V68 TCR chain with a V7 2, V7 3, V77, V 7 8,
   V 7 9, V710, or V711 TCR chain. In one aspect, the purified 76 T cells may have essentially
   identical genetic material. In one aspect, the purified 7 6 T cells may not contain a chimeric
   antigen receptor.
 5          [0009] In one aspect, the cell composition may not contain NK cells or UP T cells. In
   one aspect, the 76 T cells may express CD3. In further aspects, the 76 T cells may express or
   co-express CD38, CD95, CD25, CD27, CD28, CD45, or CCR7. In one aspect, the 76 T cells
   may not express CXCR4, CCR4, CLA, CD4, CD8, CD 122, CD 127, CD56, CD57, or PD-1.
            [0010] In various aspects, 76 T cells of the present embodiment may be genetically
10 edited to improve therapeutic potential.     Such genetic editing may be performed by any
   means known in the art, such as, for example, by the use of artificial nuclease(s).        Such
   genetic editing may redirect the specificity of the 76 T cells through the expression of a
   chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or T-cell receptor (TCR).            Such genetic editing may
   improve the potency of the 76 T cells by improving homing, cytokine production, recycle
15 killing, and/or improved engraftment.
            [0011] In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition is provided comprising a
   cell composition of the present embodiments and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
            [0012] In one embodiment, a method of producing a cell composition of the present
   embodiments is provided. The method may comprise obtaining a sample of cells comprising
20 a first polyclonal 76 T-cell population; and culturing the first polyclonal 76 T-cell population
   with artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs) in the presence of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and
   interleukin-21 (IL-2 1). In some aspects, the culturing may occur ex vivo for a limited period
   of time in order to expand the T-cell population. In one aspect, the culturing step may further
   comprise culturing with an aminobisphosphonate (e.g., zoledronic acid).
25          [0013] In one aspect, the sample of cells may be a peripheral blood sample or an
   umbilical cord blood sample. In another aspect, the sample of cells may be obtained from
   tissues. In another aspect, the sample of cells may be obtained from a single subject. The
   subject may be a donor or a patient. In some aspects, 7 6 T cells generated from a single
   donor may be infused into one or more allogeneic recipients. In one aspect, the 7 6 T cells
30 may be human 7 6 T cells.

    WO 2015/061694                                                              PCT/US2014/062191
            [0014] In some aspects, purification of the initial population of 75 T cells prior to
   culturing may comprise isolation/enrichment, such as with paramagnetic bead selection or
   flow cytometry.    Such selection may comprise depleting the sample of cells of CD56- and
   TCRap-expressing cells. The purity of the 75 T cells may be based on the presence of TCR
 5 that stains with a monoclonal antibody specific for one or more 76 TCR.
            [0015] In one aspect, the aAPCs may be transgenic K562 cells. In one aspect, the
   aAPCs may express CD137L. In other aspects, the aAPCs may further express CD19, CD64,
   CD86, or mIL15.       In certain aspects, the aAPCs may expression at least one anti-CD3
   antibody clone, such as, for example, OKT3 and/or UCHT1. In one aspect, the aAPCs may
10 be inactivated (e.g., irradiated). In one aspect, the aAPCs may have been tested for and
   confirmed to be free of infectious material. Methods for producing such aAPCs are known in
   the art.
            [0016] In one aspect, the first polyclonal 76 T-cell population may comprise about 104
   to about 106 76 T cells. In one aspect, culturing the first polyclonal 76 T-cell population with
15 aAPCs may comprise culturing the cells at a ratio of about 10:1 to about 1:10; about 3:1 to
   about 1:5; about 1:1 to about 1:3 (76 T cells to aAPCs); or any range derivable therein. For
   example, the co-culture of T cells and aAPCs can be at a ratio of about 1:1, about 1:2 or
   about 1:3.
            [0017] In one aspect, the aAPC in the culture may be replenished every week. In one
20 aspect, culturing the first polyclonal 76 T cell population with aAPCs may comprise culturing
   for at least two weeks. In one aspect, culturing the first polyclonal 76 T-cell population with
   aAPCs may result in at least a 100-fold increase in the number of polyclonal 76 T cells.
            [0018] In one embodiment, a method of producing a cell composition of the present
   embodiments is provided. The method may comprise obtaining a sample of cells comprising
25 a first polyclonal 76 T-cell population; and culturing the first polyclonal 76 T-cell population
   in the presence of at least one anti-CD3 antibody clone, such as, for example, OKT3 and/or
   UCHT1, and further in the presence of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-21 (IL-21). In
   some aspects, the anti-CD3 antibody clone may be expressed on the surface of an aAPC. In
   other aspects, the anti-CD3 antibody clone may be on the surface of a microbead.

           [0019] In some aspects, the culturing may occur ex vivo for a limited period of time in
   order to expand the T-cell population. In one aspect, the culturing step may further comprise
   culturing with an aminobisphosphonate (e.g., zoledronic acid).
           [0020] In one aspect, the sample of cells may be a peripheral blood sample or an
 5 umbilical cord blood sample. In another aspect, the sample of cells may be obtained from a
   single subject. The subject may be a donor or a patient. In one aspect, the 76 T cells may be
   human 76 T cells. In some aspects, the 76 T cells may be derived from stem cells, such as
   embryonic stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells.
           [0021] In some aspects, purification of the initial population of 76 T cells prior to
10 culturing may comprise paramagnetic bead selection or flow cytometry. Such selection may
   comprise depleting the sample of cells of CD56- and TCRap-expressing cells. The purity of
   the 76 T cells may be based on the presence of TCR that stains with a monoclonal antibody
   specific for the 76 TCR and absence of staining for up TCR.
           [0022] In one aspect, culturing the first polyclonal 76 T cell population with aAPCs
15 may comprise culturing for at least two weeks. In one aspect, culturing the first polyclonal 76
   T-cell population may result in at least a 100-fold increase in the number of polyclonal 76 T
   cells.
           [0023] In one embodiment, a method of treating a disease in a patient is provided
   comprising administering an effective amount of a cell composition or a pharmaceutical
20 composition of the present embodiments. In one aspect, the patients may be a human patient.
           [0024] In one aspect, the disease may be cancer. In certain aspects, the cancer may be
   a hematological or solid cancer, such as T-cell ALL, B-ALL, CML, colon cancer, ovarian
   cancer, neuroblastoma, brain tumor(s), or pancreatic cancer. In some aspects, the patient may
   have undergone a previous anti-cancer therapy.         In one aspect, the patient may be in

            [0026] In one aspect, the cell composition may be allogeneic to the patient.        In
   various aspects, an allogeneic cell composition may or may not share HLA with the patient.
   In another aspect, the cell composition may be autologous to the patient.

   pharmaceutical composition of the present embodiments is provided for use in the treatment
   of a disease in a patient. The disease may be a cancer (e.g., T-cell ALL, B-ALL, AML, colon

                     DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS
            [0058] Human y6 T cells have natural anti-tumor immunity, but their utility in the
 5 clinic is restricted to one lineage (Vy9V62) even though other y6 T-cell lineages can
   recognize and kill tumors. A polyclonal approach to y6 T-cell immunotherapy could target
   multiple ligands on the tumor surface and maximize therapeutic efficacy. However, a
   clinically-relevant expansion of polyclonal y6 T cells has yet to be achieved. Recognition of
   multiple ligands on the tumor surface is mediated by the T cell receptor (TCR) expressed on
10 the y6 T cell surface, which is composed of a heterodimer of 6 and y TCR chains. Moreover,
   y6 T-cell TCR recognizes antigens outside of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
   restriction, which is in contrast to a  T cells that do recognize their antigens in the context of
   MHC. Therefore, MHC mis-matched y6 T cells could be given to un-related patients and
   serve as a universal source of tumor-reactive T cells. As such, y6 T cells generated from one
15 donor may be infused into one or more allogeneic recipients that may or may not share HLA
   with the donor. This provides an "off-the-shelf" therapy in which y6 T cells can be both pre
   prepared and infused on demand.
            [0059] T cells expressing T-cell receptors (TCRs) composed of heterodimers of y and
   6 chains exhibit an ability to kill malignant cells, but direct use of cells expressing V61 and
20 V63 isotypes or employing a polyclonal repertoire has yet to be achieved. The inventors
   engineered artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC) from the K562 tumor cell line to expand
   human T cells expressing defined y6 TCRs to clinically-appealing numbers. Propagated y6 T
   cells were polyclonal as they expressed V61, V62, V63, V65, V67, and V68 with V7 2, V7 3,
   Vy7, Vy8, Vy9, VylO, and Vyl 1 TCR chains. Populations of naive, central memory, and
25 effector memory T cells were dominated by expression of V61, V 1l"nVS2"e, and V62 TCR
   chains, respectively. Efficiency of T cells to lyse tumor cells followed the order of
   differentiation (V62>V6l"eV62"e>V61). Ovarian cancer xenografts were significantly
   eliminated by V6 subsets and polyclonal y6 T cells, which significantly increased overall
   survival of treated mice.

   methods using aminobisphosphonates, which have a toxic component, and (iv) successfully
 5 propagate the V6 l"e VS2"     subset. The aAPC used in the methods are immediately available
   for clinical use, therefore, streamlining the clinical translation of this technology. V61 cells
   have never been directly infused into a human. The V6 l"eV            6 2 eg subset has anti-tumor
   immunity that can now be tested for the first time in humans.
           [0061] The presently disclosed aAPC expansion technology can propagate seemingly
10 unlimited numbers of polyclonal y6 T cells from limiting starting quantities, obviating current
   hurdles of (i) limiting starting quantities of circulating y6 T cells, (ii) polarization of initial
   populations of y6 T cells towards a fixed clonotype, and (iii) the inability of expansion
   protocols used for other T cells types, i.e., a    T cells, to sustain y6 T cell proliferation. The
   presently disclosed technology has the competitive advantages of (i) using aAPC that are
15 currently in a clinical GMP facility, (ii) the ability of aAPC to numerically expand polyclonal
   y6 T cells to clinically-relevant numbers (>109 cells) from starting quantities present in small
   volumes of peripheral blood, and (iii) the use of more than one lineage of y6 T cells with the
   potential to target multiple molecules of the tumor cell surface to simultaneously minimize
   the chance for tumor escape from therapy and maximize therapeutic efficacy. These
20 polyclonal y6 T cells were able to kill every tumor type tested (ALL, CML, colon cancer,
   ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer), but did not react to normal tissues (B cells) from unrelated
   individuals. Thus, a large bank of polyclonal y6 T cells with a fixed or desired repertoire
   could be manufactured and given to unrelated patients safely for the treatment of, for
   example, cancer.
25         [0062] The present invention results in cell therapy products for adoptive T cell
   therapies and has at least four potential uses. First, polyclonal y6 T cells can be used as a
   universal source of tumor reactive T cells that can be given to unrelated individuals. This has
   commercialization appeal as a universal source of T cells could decrease the costs associated
   with generating autologous T cells for each patient to be treated. Second, polyclonal y6 T
30 cells can be further manipulated to increase their tumor reactivity, e.g., through introduction
   of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that targets a specific tumor antigen. Third, polyclonal

   y6 T cells also have anti-viral activity (cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),
   and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)) and can be used as direct immunotherapies for
   viral infection and/or protection of opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients,
   e.g., cancer patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Fourth, transplant
 5 of a universal set of polyclonal y6 T cells may be used in the control of bacterial infection and
   sepsis.
   I.       Immune System and Immunotherapy
            [0063] In some embodiments, a medical disorder is treated by transfer of a polyclonal
   76 T-cell population that elicits an immune response. In certain embodiments of the present
10 invention, cancer or infection is treated by transfer of a polyclonal 76 T-cell population that
   elicits an immune response.     Thus, a basic understanding of the immunologic responses is
   necessary.
            [0064] The cells of the adaptive immune system are a type of leukocyte, called a
   lymphocyte. B cells and T cells are the major types of lymphocytes. B cells and T cells are
15 derived from the same pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells, and are indistinguishable from
   one another until after they are activated. B cells play a large role in the humoral immune
   response, whereas T cells are intimately involved in cell-mediated immune responses. They
   can be distinguished from other lymphocyte types, such as B cells and NK cells by the
   presence of a special receptor on their cell surface called the T-cell receptor (TCR). In nearly
20 all other vertebrates, B cells and T cells are produced by stem cells in the bone marrow. T
   cells travel to and develop in the thymus, from which they derive their name. In humans,
   approximately 1%-2% of the lymphocyte pool recirculates each hour to optimize the
   opportunities for antigen-specific lymphocytes to find their specific antigen within the
   secondary lymphoid tissues.
25          [0065] T lymphocytes arise from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, and
   typically migrate to the thymus gland to mature. up T cells express a unique antigen binding
   receptor on their membrane (T-cell receptor), which can only recognize antigen in association
   with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of other cells. 76 T
   cells are a small subset of circulating T lymphocytes that are distinct from UP T cells. 76 T
30 cells are able to recognize both peptide and non-peptide antigens that may be derived from
                                                   - 17 -

   either foreign microorganisms or endogenous cellular products induced by stress, such as
   viral infection or cancer. Unlike up T cells, 75 T cells are not MHC-restricted.
            [0066] Since 75 T cells lack the fine specificity characteristics of UP T cells, it has
   been proposed that they represent a more primitive immune mechanism that provides a first
 5 line surveillance function against infection and tumors (Boismenu et al., 1997).            Several
   studies have documented the response of 75 T cells to various viruses, bacteria, and parasites
   (Bukowski et al., 1994; Wallace et al., 1995; Lang et al., 1995; Elloso et al., 1996) as well as
   their ability to mediate lysis of tumor cells of various origins (Zocchi et al., 1990; Kitayama
   et al., 1993; Choudhary et al., 1995).        These results suggest that 76 T cells may have
10 therapeutic potential in the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases.
   II.      Method and Compositions Related to the Embodiments
            [0067] In certain aspects, the invention includes a method of making and/or
   expanding polyclonal 76 T cells that comprises culturing the cells with artificial antigen
   presenting cells. In certain aspects, the 76 T cells are primary human 76 T cells, such as 76 T
15 cells derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), PBMC collected after
   stimulation with G-CSF, bone marrow, or umbilical cord blood. The cells may be propagated
   for days, weeks, or months ex vivo as a bulk population in co-culture with aAPCs. Co
   cultures may be initiated with 10', 104 , 10 5, 106, 107 , or 108 76 T cells, or any number
   derivable therein, and 10', 104 , 105, 106, 107 , 108, or 109 aAPC, or any number derivable
20 therein. It is preferable that the co-cultures be initiated with a ratio of 76 T cells to aAPC of 1
   to 2.
            [0068] The 76 T cells may be expanded by stimulation with IL-2, or other cytokines
   that bind the common gamma-chain (e.g., IL-7, IL-12, IL-15, IL-21, and others).                The
   expansion of 76 T cells may be stimulated with 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100
25 U/mL of IL-2; preferably the expansion is stimulated with 50 U/mL of IL-2. The expansion
   of 7 6 T cells may be stimulated with 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 ng/mL of IL
   21; preferably the expansion is stimulated with 30 ng/mL of IL-21. Said stimulations may
   occur 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 times per week, preferably 3 times per week. In a further aspect,
   the expanded 76 T cells may be cryopreserved.
30          [0069] In certain embodiments of the invention, the 76 T cells are delivered to an
   individual in need thereof, such as an individual may have cancer or an infection. The cells
                                                    - 18-

   then enhance the individual's immune system to attack the respective cancer, pathogenic
   cells, or pathogen-infected cells. In some cases, the individual is provided with one or more
   doses of the 75 T cells. In cases where the individual is provided with two or more doses of
   the 75 T cells, the duration between the administrations should be sufficient to allow time for
 5 propagation in the individual, and in specific embodiments the duration between doses is 1, 2,
   3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or more days. The 76 T cells may be allogeneic or autologous to the patient.
            [0070] Tumors for which the present treatment methods are useful include any
   malignant cell type, such as those found in a solid tumor or a hematological tumor.
   Exemplary solid tumors can include, but are not limited to, a tumor of an organ selected from
10 the group consisting of pancreas, colon, cecum, stomach, brain, head, neck, ovary, kidney,
   larynx, sarcoma, lung, bladder, melanoma, prostate, and breast. Exemplary hematological
   tumors include tumors of the bone marrow, T or B cell malignancies, leukemias, lymphomas,
   blastomas, myelomas, and the like. Further examples of cancers that may be treated using the
   methods provided herein include, but are not limited to, lung cancer (including small-cell
15 lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, and squamous
   carcinoma of the lung), cancer of the peritoneum, gastric or stomach cancer (including
   gastrointestinal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal cancer), pancreatic cancer, cervical

            [0072] In some aspects, the 76 T cells are obtained from a bank of umbilical cord
   blood, peripheral blood, human embryonic stem cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells, for
   example. Suitable doses for a therapeutic effect would be at least 105 or between about 105
   and about 1010 cells per dose, for example, preferably in a series of dosing cycles.        An
15 exemplary dosing regimen consists of four one-week dosing cycles of escalating doses,
   starting at least at about 105 cells on Day 0, for example increasing incrementally up to a
   target dose of about 1010 cells within several weeks of initiating an intra-patient dose
   escalation scheme.     Suitable modes of administration include intravenous, subcutaneous,
   intracavitary (for example by reservoir-access device), intraperitoneal, and direct injection
20 into a tumor mass.
            [0073] A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be used alone or in
   combination with other well-established agents useful for treating cancer or infectious
   diseases. Whether delivered alone or in combination with other agents, the pharmaceutical
   composition of the present invention can be delivered via various routes and to various sites
25 in a mammalian, particularly human, body to achieve a particular effect. One skilled in the
   art will recognize that, although more than one route can be used for administration, a
   particular route can provide a more immediate and more effective reaction than another route.
   Local or systemic delivery can be accomplished by administration comprising application or
   instillation of the formulation into body cavities or by parenteral introduction comprising
30 intramuscular, intravenous, intraportal, intrahepatic, peritoneal, subcutaneous, or intradermal
   administration.

            [0074] A composition of the present invention can be provided in unit dosage form
   wherein each dosage unit, e.g., an injection, contains a predetermined amount of the
   composition, alone or in appropriate combination with other active agents. The term unit
   dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for
 5 human and animal subjects, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of the composition
   of the present invention, alone or in combination with other active agents, calculated in an
   amount sufficient to produce the desired effect, in association with a pharmaceutically
   acceptable diluent, carrier, or vehicle, where appropriate. The specifications for the novel
   unit dosage forms of the present invention depend on the particular pharmacodynamics
10 associated with the pharmaceutical composition in the particular subject.
            [0075] Desirably an effective amount or sufficient number of the isolated, polyclonal
   76 T cells is present in the composition and introduced into the subject such that long-term,
   specific, anti-tumor responses are established to reduce the size of a tumor or eliminate tumor
   growth or regrowth than would otherwise result in the absence of such treatment. Desirably,
15 the amount of polyclonal 76 T cells introduced into the subject causes a 10%, 20%, 30%,
   40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 100% decrease in tumor size when
   compared to otherwise same conditions wherein the polyclonal 76 T cells are not present.
            [0076] Accordingly, the amount of polyclonal 76 T cells administered should take
   into account the route of administration and should be such that a sufficient number of the
20 polyclonal 76 T cells will be introduced so as to achieve the desired therapeutic response.
   Furthermore, the amounts of each active agent included in the compositions described herein
   (e.g., the amount per each cell to be contacted or the amount per certain body weight) can
   vary in different applications. In general, the concentration of polyclonal 76 T cells desirably
   should be sufficient to provide in the subject being treated at least from about 1 x 106 to about
25  1 x 109 polyclonal 76 T cells, even more desirably, from about 1 x 107 to about 5 x 108
   polyclonal 76 T cells, although any suitable amount can be utilized either above, e.g., greater
   than 5 x 108 cells, or below, e.g., less than 1  x 107 cells. The dosing schedule can be based
   on well-established cell-based therapies (see, e.g., Topalian and Rosenberg, 1987; U.S. Pat.
   No. 4,690,915), or an alternate continuous infusion strategy can be employed.
30          [0077] These values provide general guidance of the range of polyclonal 76 T cells to
   be utilized by the practitioner upon optimizing the method of the present invention for
   practice of the invention. The recitation herein of such ranges by no means precludes the use

   of a higher or lower amount of a component, as might be warranted in a particular
   application. For example, the actual dose and schedule can vary depending on whether the
   compositions are administered in combination with other pharmaceutical compositions, or
   depending on interindividual differences         in pharmacokinetics, drug disposition, and

   with the exigencies of the particular situation.
   III.    Artificial Antigen Presenting Cells
            [0078] In some cases, aAPCs are useful in preparing therapeutic compositions and
   cell therapy products of the embodiments. For general guidance regarding the preparation and
10 use of antigen-presenting systems, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,225,042, 6,355,479, 6,362,001
   and 6,790,662; U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2009/0017000 and 2009/0004142;
   and International Publication No. W02007/103009.
            [0079] aAPC systems may comprise at least one exogenous assisting molecule. Any
   suitable number and combination of assisting molecules may be employed. The assisting
15 molecule may be selected from assisting molecules such as co-stimulatory molecules and
   adhesion molecules. Exemplary co-stimulatory molecules include CD86 and B7.1 (B7.1 was
   previously known as B7 and also known as CD80), which among other things, bind to CD28
   and/or CTLA-4 molecules on the surface of T cells, thereby affecting, for example, T-cell
   expansion, Th1 differentiation, short-term T-cell survival, and cytokine secretion such as
20 interleukin (IL)-2 (see, Kim et al., 2004). Adhesion molecules may include carbohydrate
   binding glycoproteins such as selectins, transmembrane binding glycoproteins such as
   integrins, calcium-dependent proteins such as cadherins, and single-pass transmembrane
   immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily proteins, such as intercellular adhesion molecules
   (ICAMs), which promote, for example, cell-to-cell or cell-to-matrix contact. Exemplary
25 adhesion molecules include LFA-3 and ICAMs, such as ICAM-1. Techniques, methods, and
   reagents useful for selection, cloning, preparation, and expression of exemplary assisting
   molecules, including co-stimulatory molecules and adhesion molecules, are exemplified in,
   e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,225,042, 6,355,479, and 6,362,001.
            [0080] In other preferred embodiments, the aAPCs may be inactivated (e.g., by
30 chemical treatment or irradiation), so that essentially no cell growth or replication occurs
   after the inactivation. Thus inactivation maintains the important APC functions of aAPCs
                                                    -23 -

   while helping to alleviate concerns about safety of a cell therapy product developed using the
   aAPCs. For methods related to crosslinking and aAPCs, see for example, U.S. Patent
   Application Publication No. 2009/0017000, which is incorporated herein by reference.
   Subsequently, an inactivated aAPC culture may be maintained for as long a time as is
 5 appropriate to activate and enrich for a therapeutically effective population of polyclonal 76 T
   cells.
   IV.      Chimeric Antigen Receptors
            [0081] The term "chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)," as used herein, may refer to
   artificial T-cell receptors T-bodies, single-chain immunoreceptors, chimeric T-cell receptors,
10 or chimeric immunoreceptors, for example, and encompass engineered receptors that graft an
   artificial specificity onto a particular immune effector cell.     CARs may be employed to
   impart the specificity of a monoclonal antibody onto a T cell, thereby allowing a large
   number of specific T cells to be generated, for example, for use in adoptive cell therapy. In
   specific embodiments, CARs direct specificity of the cell to a tumor associated antigen, for
15 example.     In some embodiments, CARs comprise an intracellular activation domain, a
   transmembrane domain, and an extracellular domain that may vary in length and comprises a
   tumor associated antigen binding region. In particular aspects, CARs comprise fusions of
   single-chain variable fragments (scFv) derived from monoclonal antibodies, fused to CD3
   zeta a transmembrane domain and endodomain. The specificity of other CAR designs may
20 be derived from ligands of receptors (e.g., peptides) or from pattern-recognition receptors,
   such as Dectins.      In certain cases, the spacing of the antigen-recognition domain can be
   modified to reduce activation-induced cell death. In certain cases, CARs comprise domains
   for additional co-stimulatory signaling, such as CD3-zeta, FcR, CD27, CD28, CD137,
   DAP10, and/or OX40.          In some cases, molecules can be co-expressed with the CAR,
25 including co-stimulatory molecules, reporter genes for imaging (e.g., for positron emission
   tomography), gene products that conditionally ablate the T cells upon addition of a pro-drug,
   homing receptors, chemokines, chemokine receptors, cytokines, and cytokine receptors.
            [0082] The term "T-cell receptor (TCR)" as used herein refers to a protein receptor on
   T cells that is composed of a heterodimer of a gamma and a delta ( 7 /6) chain.                In
30 embodiments of the invention, the TCR may be modified on any cell comprising a TCR,
   including a helper T cell, a cytotoxic T cell, a memory T cell, regulatory T cell, natural killer
   T cell, and gamma delta T cell, for example.

           [0083] As used herein, the term "antigen" is a molecule capable of being bound by an
   antibody or T-cell receptor.       An antigen is additionally capable of inducing a humoral
   immune response and/or cellular immune response leading to the production of B and/or T
   lymphocytes.
 5         [0084] Embodiments of the present invention involve nucleic acids, including nucleic
   acids encoding an antigen-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) polypeptide, including a
   CAR that has been humanized to reduce immunogenicity (hCAR), comprising an
   intracellular signaling domain, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular domain
   comprising one or more signaling motifs. In certain embodiments, the CAR may recognize
10 an epitope comprised of the shared space between one or more antigens. Pattern recognition
   receptors, such as Dectin-1, may be used to derive specificity to a carbohydrate antigen. In
   certain embodiments, the binding region can comprise complementary determining regions of
   a monoclonal antibody, variable regions of a monoclonal antibody, and/or antigen binding
   fragments thereof. In another embodiment, that specificity is derived from a peptide (e.g.,
15 cytokine) that binds to a receptor. A complementarity determining region (CDR) is a short
   amino acid sequence found in the variable domains of antigen receptor (e.g., immunoglobulin
   and T-cell receptor) proteins that complements an antigen and therefore provides the receptor
   with its specificity for that particular antigen. Each polypeptide chain of an antigen receptor
   contains three CDRs (CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3). Since the antigen receptors are typically
20 composed of two polypeptide chains, there are six CDRs for each antigen receptor that can
   come into contact with the antigen -- each heavy and light chain contains three CDRs.
   Because most sequence variation associated with immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors are
   found in the CDRs, these regions are sometimes referred to as hypervariable domains.
   Among these, CDR3 shows the greatest variability as it is encoded by a recombination of the
25 VJ (VDJ in the case of heavy chain and TCR ap chain) regions.
           [0085] It is contemplated that the human CAR nucleic acids are human genes to
   enhance cellular immunotherapy for human patients. In a specific embodiment, the invention
   includes a full length CAR cDNA or coding region. The antigen binding regions or domain
   can comprise a fragment of the VH and VL chains of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv)
30 derived from a particular human monoclonal antibody, such as those described in U.S. Patent
   7,109,304, incorporated herein by reference.         The fragment can also be any number of
   different antigen binding domains of a human antigen-specific antibody. In a more specific
                                                    - 25 -

   embodiment, the fragment is an antigen-specific scFv encoded by a sequence that is
   optimized for human codon usage for expression in human cells.
           [0086] The arrangement could be multimeric, such as a diabody or multimers. The
   multimers are most likely formed by cross pairing of the variable portion of the light and
 5 heavy chains into what has been referred to as a diabody. The hinge portion of the construct
   can have multiple alternatives from being totally deleted, to having the first cysteine
   maintained, to a proline rather than a serine substitution, to being truncated up to the first
   cysteine. The Fc portion can be deleted. Any protein that is stable and/or dimerizes can
   serve this purpose. One could use just one of the Fc domains, e.g., either the CH2 or CH3
10 domain from human immunoglobulin. One could also use the hinge, CH2 and CH3 region of
   a human immunoglobulin that has been modified to improve dimerization. One could also
   use just the hinge portion of an immunoglobulin. One could also use portions of CD8alpha.
           [0087] The intracellular signaling domain of the chimeric receptor of the invention is
   responsible for activation of at least one of the normal effector functions of the immune cell
15 in which the chimeric receptor has been placed. The term "effector function" refers to a
   specialized function of a differentiated cell. Effector function of a T cell, for example, may
   be cytolytic activity or helper activity including the secretion of cytokines. Effector function
   in a naive, stem-cell like, memory, or memory-type T cell includes antigen-dependent
   proliferation. Thus the term "intracellular signaling domain" refers to the portion of a protein
20 that transduces the effector function signal and directs the cell to perform a specialized
   function. While usually the entire intracellular signaling domain will be employed, in many
   cases it will not be necessary to use the entire intracellular polypeptide. To the extent that a
   truncated portion of the intracellular signaling domain may find use, such truncated portion
   may be used in place of the intact chain as long as it still transduces the effector function
25 signal. The term intracellular signaling domain is thus meant to include any truncated portion
   of the intracellular signaling domain sufficient to transduce the effector function signal.
   Examples include the zeta chain of the T-cell receptor or any of its homologs (e.g., eta, delta,
   gamma, or epsilon), MB1 chain, B29, Fc RIII, Fc RI, and combinations of signaling
   molecules, such as CD3G and CD28, CD27, 4-1BB, DAP-10, OX40, and combinations
30 thereof, as well as other similar molecules and fragments as well as mutations to the signaling
   moieties such as modifying the ITAMs. Intracellular signaling portions of other members of
   the families of activating proteins can be used, such as FcyRIII and FcRI.

    WO 2015/061694                                                               PCT/US2014/062191
           [0088] The antigen-specific extracellular domain and the intracellular signaling
   domain may be linked by a transmembrane domain, such as the human IgG 4Fc hinge and Fc
   regions.   Alternatives include the human CD4 transmembrane domain, the human CD28
   transmembrane domain, the transmembrane human CD3G domain, or one or more cysteine
 5 mutated human CD3G domain(s), or other transmembrane domains from other human
   transmembrane signaling proteins, such as CD16 and CD8 and erythropoietin receptor.
           [0089] In some embodiments, the CAR nucleic acid comprises a sequence encoding
   other costimulatory receptors, such as a transmembrane domain and a modified CD28
   intracellular signaling domain. Other costimulatory receptors include, but are not limited to
10 one or more of CD28, CD27, OX-40 (CD134), DAP1O, and 4-1BB (CD137). In addition to a
   primary signal initiated by CD3 (, an additional signal provided by a human costimulatory
   receptor inserted in a human CAR is important for full activation of T cells and could help
   improve in vivo persistence and the therapeutic success of the adoptive immunotherapy.
           [0090] In particular embodiments, the invention concerns isolated nucleic acid
15 segments and expression cassettes incorporating DNA sequences that encode the CAR.
   Vectors of the present invention are designed, primarily, to deliver desired genes to immune
   cells, preferably T cells under the control of regulated eukaryotic promoters, for example,
   MNDU3 promoter, CMV promoter, EFlalpha promoter, or Ubiquitin promoter. Also, the
   vectors may contain a selectable marker, if for no other reason, to facilitate their manipulation
20 in vitro. In other embodiments, the CAR can be expressed from mRNA in vitro transcribed
   from a DNA template.
           [0091] Chimeric antigen receptor molecules are recombinant and are distinguished by
   their ability to both bind antigen and transduce activation signals via one or more
   immunoreceptor activation motifs (ITAM's) present in their cytoplasmic tails.           Receptor
25 constructs utilizing an antigen-binding moiety (for example, generated from single chain
   antibodies (scFv)) afford the additional advantage of being "universal" in that they bind
   native antigen on the target cell surface in an HLA-independent fashion.            For example,
   several laboratories have reported on scFv constructs fused to sequences coding for the
   intracellular portion of the CD3 complex's zeta chain (C), the Fc receptor gamma chain, and
30 sky tyrosine kinase. Re-directed T cell effector mechanisms including tumor recognition and
   lysis by CTL have been documented in several murine and human antigen-scFv: ( systems.
                                                  - 27 -

    WO 2015/061694                                                             PCT/US2014/062191
            [0092] To date non-human antigen binding regions are typically used in constructing
   a chimeric antigen receptor. A potential problem with using non-human antigen binding
   regions, such as murine monoclonal antibodies, is the lack of human effector functionality
   and inability to penetrate into tumor masses. In other words, such antibodies may be unable
 5 to mediate complement-dependent lysis or lyse human target cells through antibody
   dependent cellular toxicity or Fc-receptor mediated phagocytosis to destroy cells expressing
   CAR. Furthermore, non-human monoclonal antibodies can be recognized by the human host
   as a foreign protein, and therefore, repeated injections of such foreign antibodies can lead to
   the induction of immune responses leading to harmful hypersensitivity reactions.           For
10 murine-based monoclonal antibodies, this is often referred to as a Human Anti-Mouse
   Antibody (HAMA) response.         Therefore, the use of human antibodies is more preferred
   because they do not elicit as strong a HAMA response as murine antibodies. Similarly, the
   use of human sequences in the CAR can avoid immune-mediated recognition and therefore
   elimination by endogenous T cells that reside in the recipient and recognize processed
15 antigen in the context of HLA.
            [0093] In some embodiments, the chimeric antigen receptor comprises:            a) an
   intracellular signaling domain, b) a transmembrane domain, and c) an extracellular domain
   comprising an antigen binding region.
            [0094] In specific embodiments, intracellular receptor signaling domains in the CAR
20 include those of the T cell antigen receptor complex, such as the zeta chain of CD3, also Fcy
   RIII costimulatory signaling domains, CD28, CD27, DAP1O, CD137, OX40, CD2, alone or
   in a series with CD3zeta, for example. In specific embodiments, the intracellular domain
   (which may be referred to as the cytoplasmic domain) comprises part or all of one or more of
   TCR zeta chain, CD28, CD27, OX40/CD134, 4-1BB/CD137, FcRIy, ICOS/CD278, IL
25 2Rbeta/CD122, IL-2Ralpha/CD132, DAP1O, DAP12, and CD40. In some embodiments, one
   employs any part of the endogenous T cell receptor complex in the intracellular domain. One
   or multiple cytoplasmic domains may be employed, as so-called third generation CARs have
   at least two or three signaling domains fused together for additive or synergistic effect, for
   example.
30          [0095] In certain embodiments of the chimeric antigen receptor, the antigen-specific
   portion of the receptor (which may be referred to as an extracellular domain comprising an
   antigen binding region) comprises a tumor associated antigen or a pathogen-specific antigen

   binding domain including carbohydrate antigen recognized by pattern-recognition receptors,
   such as Dectin-1. A tumor associated antigen may be of any kind so long as it is expressed
   on the cell surface of tumor cells. Exemplary embodiments of tumor associated antigens
   include CD19, CD20, carcinoembryonic antigen, alphafetoprotein, tyrosine-protein kinase
 5 transmembrane receptor (ROR)1, CA-125, MUC-1, CD56, EGFR, c-Met, AKT, Her2, Her3,
   epithelial tumor antigen, melanoma-associated antigen, mutated p53, mutated ras, and so
   forth. In certain embodiments, the CAR can be co-expressed with a membrane-bound
   cytokine to improve persistence when there is a low amount of tumor-associated antigen. For
   example, CAR can be co-expressed with membrane-bound IL-15.
10         [0096] In certain embodiments intracellular tumor associated antigens may be
   targeted, such as HA-1, survivin, WT1, and p53. This can be achieved by a CAR expressed
   on a universal T cell that recognizes the processed peptide described from the intracellular
   tumor associated antigen in the context of HLA. In addition, the universal T cell may be
   genetically modified to express a T-cell receptor pairing that recognizes the intracellular
15 processed tumor associated antigen in the context of HLA.
           [0097] The pathogen may be of any kind, but in specific embodiments the pathogen is
   a fungus, bacteria, or virus, for example. Exemplary viral pathogens include those of the
   families of Adenoviridae, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Respiratory
   Syncytial Virus (RSV), JC virus, BK virus, HSV, HHV family of viruses, Picomaviridae,
20 Herpesviridae,      Hepadnaviridae,      Flaviviridae,    Retroviridae,   Orthomyxoviridae,
   Paramyxoviridae,     Papovaviridae,    Polyomavirus,     Rhabdoviridae,   and    Togaviridae.
   Exemplary pathogenic viruses cause smallpox, influenza, mumps, measles, chickenpox,
   ebola, and rubella. Exemplary pathogenic fungi include Candida,Aspergillus, Cryptococcus,
   Histoplasma, Pneumocystis, and Stachybotrys.          Exemplary pathogenic bacteria include
25 Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Shigella, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus, Helicobacter, E.
   coli, Rickettsia, Bacillus, Bordetella, Chlamydia, Spirochetes, and Salmonella.       In one
   embodiment the pathogen receptor Dectin-1 can be used to generate a CAR that recognizes
   the carbohydrate structure on the cell wall of fungi. T cells genetically modified to express
   the CAR based on the specificity of Dectin-1 can recognize Aspergillus and target hyphal
30 growth. In another embodiment, CARs can be made based on an antibody recognizing viral
   determinants (e.g., the glycoproteins from CMV and Ebola) to interrupt viral infections and
   pathology.

            [0098] In some embodiments, the pathogenic antigen is an Aspergillus carbohydrate
   antigen for which the extracellular domain in the CAR recognizes patterns of carbohydrates
   of the fungal cell wall, such as via Dectin- 1.
            [0099] A chimeric immunoreceptor according to the present invention can be
 5 produced by any means known in the art, though preferably it is produced using recombinant
   DNA techniques.      A nucleic acid sequence encoding the several regions of the chimeric
   receptor can be prepared and assembled into a complete coding sequence by standard
   techniques of molecular cloning (genomic library screening, PCR, primer-assisted ligation,
   scFv libraries from yeast and bacteria, site-directed mutagenesis, etc.). The resulting coding
10 region can be inserted into an expression vector and used to transform a suitable expression
   host allogeneic T-cell line.
            [00100]        As used herein, a nucleic acid construct or nucleic acid sequence or
   polynucleotide is intended to mean a DNA molecule that can be transformed or introduced
   into a T cell and be transcribed and translated to produce a product (e.g., a chimeric antigen
15 receptor).
            [00101]        In an exemplary nucleic acid construct (polynucleotide) employed in
   the present invention, the promoter is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence encoding
   the chimeric receptor of the present invention, i.e., they are positioned so as to promote
   transcription of the messenger RNA from the DNA encoding the chimeric receptor. The
20 promoter can be of genomic origin or synthetically generated. A variety of promoters for use
   in T cells are well-known in the art (e.g., a CD4 promoter). The promoter can be constitutive
   or inducible, where induction is associated with the specific cell type or a specific level of
   maturation, for example. Alternatively, a number of well-known viral promoters are also
   suitable. Promoters of interest include the p-actin promoter, SV40 early and late promoters,
25 immunoglobulin promoter, human cytomegalovirus promoter, retrovirus promoter, and the
   Friend spleen focus-forming virus promoter. The promoters may or may not be associated
   with enhancers, wherein the enhancers may be naturally associated with the particular
   promoter or associated with a different promoter.
            [00102]        The sequence of the open reading frame encoding the chimeric
30 receptor can be obtained from a genomic DNA source, a cDNA source, or can be synthesized
   (e.g., via PCR), or combinations thereof. Depending upon the size of the genomic DNA and

   the number of introns, it may be desirable to use cDNA or a combination thereof as it is
   found that introns stabilize the mRNA or provide T cell-specific expression. Also, it may be
   further advantageous to use endogenous or exogenous non-coding regions to stabilize the
   mRNA.
 5          [00103]        For expression of a chimeric antigen receptor of the present invention,
   the naturally occurring or endogenous transcriptional initiation region of the nucleic acid
   sequence encoding N-terminal components of the chimeric receptor can be used to generate
   the chimeric receptor in the target host. Alternatively, an exogenous transcriptional initiation
   region can be used that allows for constitutive or inducible expression, wherein expression
10 can be controlled depending upon the target host, the level of expression desired, the nature
   of the target host, and the like.
            [00104]        Likewise, a signal sequence directing the chimeric receptor to the
   surface membrane can be the endogenous signal sequence of N-terminal component of the
   chimeric receptor.     Optionally, in some instances, it may be desirable to exchange this
15 sequence for a different signal sequence. However, the signal sequence selected should be
   compatible with the secretory pathway of T cells so that the chimeric receptor is presented on
   the surface of the T cell.
            [00105]         Similarly, a termination region may be provided by the naturally
   occurring or endogenous transcriptional termination region of the nucleic acid sequence
20 encoding the C-terminal component of the chimeric receptor. Alternatively, the termination
   region may be derived from a different source.          For the most part, the source of the
   termination region is generally not considered to be critical to the expression of a
   recombinant protein and a wide variety of termination regions can be employed without
   adversely affecting expression.
25          [00106]        As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that, in some instances,
   a few amino acids at the ends of the antigen binding domain in the CAR can be deleted,
   usually not more than 10, more usually not more than 5 residues, for example. Also, it may
   be desirable to introduce a small number of amino acids at the borders, usually not more than
    10, more usually not more than 5 residues. The deletion or insertion of amino acids may be
30 as a result of the needs of the construction, providing for convenient restriction sites, ease of
   manipulation, improvement in levels of expression, or the like. In addition, the substitute of
                                                   -31 -

   one or more amino acids with a different amino acid can occur for similar reasons, usually
   not substituting more than about five amino acids in any one domain.
            [00107]        The chimeric construct that encodes the chimeric receptor according to
   the invention can be prepared in conventional ways.        Because, for the most part, natural
 5 sequences may be employed, the natural genes may be isolated and manipulated, as
   appropriate, so as to allow for the proper joining of the various components.          Thus, the
   nucleic acid sequences encoding for the N-terminal and C-terminal proteins of the chimeric
   receptor can be isolated by employing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using
   appropriate primers that result in deletion of the undesired portions of the gene.
10 Alternatively, restriction digests of cloned genes can be used to generate the chimeric
   construct. In either case, the sequences can be selected to provide for restriction sites that are
   blunt-ended, or have complementary overlaps.
            [00108]        The various manipulations for preparing the chimeric construct can be
   carried out in vitro and in particular embodiments the chimeric construct is introduced into
15 vectors for cloning and expression in an appropriate host using standard transformation or
   transfection methods. Thus, after each manipulation, the resulting construct from joining of
   the DNA sequences is cloned, the vector isolated, and the sequence screened to ensure that
   the sequence encodes the desired chimeric receptor.        The sequence can be screened by
   restriction analysis, sequencing, or the like.
20          [00109]        The chimeric constructs of the present invention find application in
   subjects having or suspected of having cancer by reducing the size of a tumor or preventing
   the growth or re-growth of a tumor in these subjects. Accordingly, the present invention
   further relates to a method for reducing growth or preventing tumor formation in a subject by
   introducing a chimeric construct of the present invention into an isolated T cell of the subject
25 and reintroducing into the subject the transformed T cell, thereby effecting anti-tumor
   responses to reduce or eliminate tumors in the subject. Suitable T cells that can be used
   include cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) or any cell having a T cell receptor in need of
   disruption. As is well-known to one of skill in the art, various methods are readily available
   for isolating these cells from a subject. For example, using cell surface marker expression or
30 using commercially available kits (e.g., ISOCELLTM from Pierce, Rockford, Ill.).

            [00110]        It is contemplated that the chimeric construct can be introduced into
   the subject's own T cells as naked DNA or in a suitable vector.                 Methods of stably
   transfecting T cells by electroporation using naked DNA are known in the art. See, e.g., U.S.
   Pat. No. 6,410,319. Naked DNA generally refers to the DNA encoding a chimeric receptor
 5 of the present invention contained in a plasmid expression vector in proper orientation for

   cells expressing the chimeric receptor of the present invention.
            [00111]        Alternatively, a viral vector (e.g., a retroviral vector, adenoviral vector,
   adeno-associated viral vector, or lentiviral vector) can be used to introduce the chimeric
10 construct into T cells. Alternatively, non-viral vectors can be used, such as DNA and mRNA
   species that participate in transportation, which includes the Sleeping Beauty system. Other
   plasmids include DNA species that exist as episomal plasmids. Suitable vectors for use in
   accordance with the method of the present invention are non-replicating in the subject's T
   cells. A large number of vectors are known that are based on viruses, where the copy number
15 of the virus maintained in the cell is low enough to maintain the viability of the cell.
   Illustrative vectors include the pFB-neo vectors (STRATAGENE@) disclosed herein as well
   as vectors based on HIV, SV40, EBV, HSV, or BPV.
            [00112]        Once it is established that the transfected or transduced T cell is
   capable of expressing the chimeric receptor as a surface membrane protein with the desired
20 regulation and at a desired level, it can be determined whether the chimeric receptor is
   functional in the host cell to provide for the desired signal induction.          Subsequently, the
   transduced T cells are reintroduced or administered to the subject to activate anti-tumor
   responses in the subject. To facilitate administration, the transduced T cells according to the
   invention can be made into a pharmaceutical composition or made into an implant
25 appropriate for administration in vivo, with appropriate carriers or diluents, which further can
   be pharmaceutically acceptable.      The means of making such a composition or an implant
   have been described in the art (see, for instance, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th
   Ed., Mack, ed. (1980)).     Where appropriate, the transduced T cells can be formulated into a
   preparation in semisolid or liquid form, such as a capsule, solution, injection, inhalant, or
30 aerosol, in the usual ways for their respective route of administration. Means known in the
   art can be utilized to prevent or minimize release and absorption of the composition until it
   reaches the target tissue or organ, or to ensure timed-release of the composition. Desirably,

                   Example 1 - Subsets of y6 T cells for cancer immunotherapy
            [00116]        Given that y6 T cells have endogenous anti-cancer activity, such as
   against K562 cells (D'Asaro et al., 2010; Lamb et al., 1999), the inventors tested whether
   tumor cells would serve a cellular substrate to propagate polyclonal y6 T cells. K562 cells
 5 have been genetically modified to function as artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC) to
   activate and numerically expand a      T cells and NK cells ex vivo (Denman et al., 2012; Maus
   et al., 2002; Numbenjapon et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2013; Suhoski et al., 2007). The
   inventors determined that y-irradiated K562-derived aAPC (designated clone #4, genetically
   modified to co-express CD19, CD64, CD86, CD137L, and a membrane-bound mutein of IL
10  15; mIL15) in combination with cytokines can sustain the proliferation of polyclonal T cells
   expressing V61, V62, V63, V65, V67, and V68 with Vy2, Vy3, Vy7, Vy8, Vy9, Vy1O, and
   Vyll     TCRs.   The inventors    demonstrate      that these subsets   differ with  respect to
   differentiation status (naive, central memory, and effector memory) and vary in their ability
   to kill tumor cells. These comparisons have implications for adoptive immunotherapy, cancer
15 biology, and immunology.
            [00117]        Ex vivo numeric expansion of polyclonal y8 T cells on aAPC
   depends on co-stimulation and cytokines. The adoptive transfer of 76 T cells requires ex
   vivo propagation since starting numbers from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
   are limiting (gating on lymphocyte pool: 3.2% ± 1.2%; mean ± standard deviation (SD); n =
20 4). The 76 T cells isolated from PBMC were co-cultured for 22 days on y-irradiated K562
   derived aAPC (clone #4) engineered to express co-stimulatory molecules in the presence of
   soluble recombinant IL-2 and IL-21, which resulted in the outgrowth of a population of T
   cells homogeneously co-expressing CD3 and TCR 76 (97.9% ± 0.6%; mean ± SD; n = 4;
   FIG. 1A). NK cells (CD3"nCD56+) and up T cells (TCR ap4) were absent from these cultures
25 (FIG. 1B). This approach to propagation yielded >109 76 T cells from <106 total initiating
   cells in three weeks (FIG. IC), which represented a 4.9     x 103  1.7 x 103 (mean ± SD; n = 4)
   fold increase. Populations of TCR6l'TCRS2"e,           TCR" ITCRS2+, and TCR" ITCRS2"8
   were detected following co-culture indicating that aAPC supported polyclonal y6 T cell
   proliferation (FIGs. IF and IG). Thus, aAPC and recombinant human cytokines supported
30 the robust numeric expansion of polyclonal 76 T cells from small starting numbers of 76 T
   cells derived from PBMC.

           [001181         The addition of exogenous cytokines and presence of co-stimulatory
   molecules (mIL15, CD86, and CD137L) on aAPC were assessed for their ability to support
   the outgrowth of 75 T cells. Parental K562 cells were genetically modified to express
   individual co-stimulatory molecules and cloned to achieve homogeneous expression (FIG. 2)
 5 to assess the impact of introduced molecules on proliferation of 75 T cells. Co-cultures with
   exogenous IL-2 and IL-21 were initiated with 75 T cells and five sets of 7-irradiated K562: (i)
   parental,    (ii)  mIL15+,      (iii)   mIL15+CD86+,       (iv)   mIL15+CD137L+,      and      (v)
   mIL15+CD86+CD137L (clone #4). 76 T cells were cultured in parallel with cytokines and no
   APC demonstrating that soluble IL-2 and IL-21 supported only limited numeric expansion of
10 76 T cells (FIG. ID). Propagation increased when parental K562 cells were added, indicating
   that endogenous molecules on these cells can activate 76 T cells for proliferation. The
   expression of mIL15 with or without CD86 did not appear to further improve the ability of 76
   T cells to propagate compared with parental K562. In contrast, significantly higher rates of
   propagation of 76 T cells was observed with co-culture of mIL15+CD137L+ and
15 mIL15+CD86+CD137L           aAPC. Thus, it appears that CD137L is important to sustain the
   proliferation of 76 T cells on K562 cells in the presence of cytokines. When IL-2 and IL-21
   were removed from the co-culture on clone #4, the proliferation of 76 T cells ceased, and
   together these cytokines exhibited an additive benefit to the rate of 76 T cell propagation
   (FIG. 1E). This validated the approach to combining aAPC clone #4 with both IL-2 and IL
20 21 to drive the proliferation of 7 6 T cells ex vivo.
           [00119]         Ex vivo numeric expansion of neonatal y6 T cells on aAPC.
   Allogeneic umbilical cord blood (UCB) is used to restore hematopoiesis in patients
   undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). The limited abundance of
   mononuclear cells within an UCB unit collected to restore hematopoiesis curtails the number
25 of neonatal 76 T cells directly available for adoptive transfer. Thus, the inventors evaluated
   whether aAPC would sustain proliferation from reduced starting numbers of 76 T cells.
   Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to isolate 104 UCB-derived 76 T cells
   (~0.01% of a typical UCB unit) which were co-cultured on aAPC clone #4 with IL-2 and IL
   21. After 35 days, there was a 107 -fold increase in cell number, as an average of 1011 UCB
30 derived 76 T cells (Range: 6   x  109 - 3  x  10"; n = 5) were propagated from the 104 initiating
   76 T cells (FIG. 3A). Two additional stimulations were performed for 76 T cells derived from
   UCB compared to PBMC to highlight their potential for proliferating to clinically-relevant
   numbers. The 76 T-cell populations exhibited uniform co-expression of CD3 and TCR 7

   (FIG. 3B) and lacked TCRap T cells (FIG. 3C) and CD3"eCD56+ NK cells (FIG. 3D).
   Collectively, these data demonstrate that aAPC clone #4 when used with IL-2 and IL-21
   could sustain the ex vivo proliferation of UCB-derived 75 T cells from small starting
   populations.
 5          [00120]       y6 T cells    express polyclonal    and defined TCRy6 repertoire
   following propagation on aAPC.         Upon establishing that 76 T cells could numerically
   expand on aAPC, the inventors sought to determine the TCR repertoire of the propagated
   cells. A non-enzymatic digital multiplex array termed "direct TCR expression array" (DTEA)
   that quantifies the diversity of TCR expression in 76 T cells was employed here to assess if
10 aAPC-expanded 76 T cells exhibited a polyclonal TCR repertoire (Zhang et al., 2012). Four
   of eight V6 alleles (V61, V62, V63, and V68) (FIG. 4A) were detected in PBMC-derived 76
   T cells and were co-expressed with V 7 2, V77, V7 8 (two alleles), V 7 9, V710, and Vyl1 (FIG.
   4B). Similarly, polyclonal TCR repertoire of V6 and V 7 chains was observed in 76 T cells
   expanded from UCB (FIGs. 4C and 4D) albeit with reduced abundance of V62 cells, more
15 V 7 2 and presence of V 7 3, V65, and V67 cells not seen from PBMC. Thus, aAPC expanded
   76 T cells maintaining a polyclonal TCR repertoire from both PBMC and UCB.
            [00121]       The inventors sought to validate these mRNA data by sorting
   polyclonal populations with TCR6-specific antibodies and repeating DTEA on isolated
   cultures. There are only two TCR6-specific mAbs commercially available and they identified
20 three   discrete V6 populations     (V6l: TCR6l'TCRS2"e,       V62:      TCR6l"eTCR62+, and
        "
   V IVS2"     n:   TCRlITCR62" ) within aAPC-expanded 76 T cells from PBMC (FIGs. IF
   and IG) and UCB (FIG. 5) with TCR6 frequencies following V6l>V IVS2"      "      n>V62, which
   corroborated DTEA. FACS isolated subsets from PBMC-derived y6 T-cell pools were
   propagated with clone #4 as discrete populations, which maintained their identity as assessed
25 by expression of TCR6 isotypes (FIGs. 6A and 6B) and no differences in rates of
   proliferation on aAPC were observed between sorted subsets (FIG. 6C). DTEA demonstrated
   that these isolated V61, V62, and V6lnegV2"     populations predominantly expressed V61*01
   (FIG. 6D), V62*02 (FIG. 6E), and V63*01 (FIG. 6F) mRNA, respectively. Expression of
   other V62 alleles (V61*01_07 and V61*01_75) was absent from polyclonal          y6 T cells (FIG.
30 4A) and each of the sorted subsets. Small amounts of V64 (FIG. 7A), V65 (FIG. 7B), V66
   (FIG. 7C), and V67 (FIG. 7D) mRNA species were detected in the three subsets of T cells
   sorted for V6 expression. V68 mRNA was exclusively present in sorted V negV 6 2neg cells

   (FIG. 7E) and likely these T cells are the main contributors of V68 in bulk y6 T cells from
   PBMC (FIG. 4A). Collectively, these results (i) show that isolated V61 and V62 subsets were
   pure with regards to V6 mRNA expression, (ii) demonstrate that TCR             "           y6 T
   cells from PBMC primarily expressed V63 and V68 mRNA, and (iii) establish that V61, V62,
 5 and V6leVS2      e T-cell subsets could be separately propagated on aAPC.
            [00122]       DTEA was then used to evaluate Vy TCR usage to gain insight into
   allelic pairing and Vy repertoire within each of the three isolated V6 subsets. Overall, V61
   and V6lVegS62"     subsets were not different in their pairing with Vy chains (p = 0.419; Two
   way ANOVA), but Vy expression was significantly different in V62 T cells compared to both
10 V61 T cells (p < 0.0001) and V6l eVS2       eg T cells (p < 0.0001). This was also observed in
   the trends for each Vy allele where V61 and V6l eVS2        eg T cells were distinct from V62 T
   cells (FIG. 8). Indeed, significant differences were detected between V6 subsets regarding
   abundance of Vy2*02 (FIG. 8B), Vy8*O1M (FIG. 8G), Vy*O1X (FIG. 8H), V7 9*01 (FIG. 81),
   and Vy9*02 (FIG. 8J) mRNA species. Thus, the diverse Vy mRNA usage within each
15 V6 subset reinforces the polyclonal repertoire achieved upon propagation on aAPC with IL-2
   and IL-21. To our knowledge, this is the most detailed assessment of Vy usage among T cells
   expressing V61, V62, and V6l eVS2      eg subsets to date.
            [00123]       Propagated 76 T-cell subsets express distinct markers predictive of
   their therapeutic potential. T-cell functions, such as memory, homing, and cytolysis, can
20 be predicted by their surface phenotype. The inventors explored a panel of markers to
   characterize the polyclonal 76 T cells (FIG. 9). After 22 days of co-culture on aAPC, most,
   but not all, 76 T cells were CD4"9CD8"'g. These T cells were activated as measured by
   expression of CD38 and CD95, but not exhausted as evidenced by the absence of expression
   of CD57 and programmed death-i (PD-1). Most cells expressed CD27 and CD28 co
25 stimulatory ligands and had a preference towards the antigen-experienced (CD45RO) over
   naive (CD45RA) markers. Their potential for homing to the skin, lymph nodes, and bone
   marrow was demonstrated by expression of CCR4, CCR7/CD62L, and CXCR4/CLA,
   respectively. These data are consistent with ability of aAPC to propagate 76 T cells that were
   activated and antigen experienced with potential for memory formation and homing to
30 tissues.

            [00124]        The inventors' approach to propagation enabled them to distinguish
   between V61, V62, and V6l eVS2          eg  lineages, and thus they investigated whether sub
   populations of 75 T cells may have distinct differences in expression of markers that predict
   for their therapeutic potential. The inventors noted that the intensity of mAb staining for
 5 TCRy6 identified populations with distinct MFI (FIG. 1A). The V62 T cells corresponded to
   the TCRy7lOw grouping (43 ± 9; mean ± SD; n = 4), V6l eVS2         eg T cells corresponded to the
   TCR7intermediate grouping (168 ± 40), and V61 T cells corresponded to the TCR76hi grouping
   (236 ± 56) (FIGs. 10A and 10B). CD4 and CD8 are not commonly expressed on 75 T cells,
   but variations were detected in expression of CD4 and CD8 in the separated subsets (FIGs.
10  1OC and 1OD). Differences were observed in expression of canonical markers used to
   describe memory among a         T cells, including CCR7/CD62L (FIG. 10E) and CD27/CD28
   (FIG. 10F) that showed V61 and Vl"gVS2"                populations as distinct from V62 cells.
   However, human 75 T-cell memory has been reported based on expression of CD27 and
   CD45RA (FIG. lOG) where CD27CD45RA+, CD27+CD45RA"e, CD27"nCD45RA"e, and
15 CD27"nCD45RA+        correspond to TN, TCM, TEM, and      TEMRA,  respectively (Caccamo et al.,
   2011; Pang et al., 2012). Most TN cells were V61, most TCM were V6lneg62neg, most TEM
   cells were V62, and all V6 subsets had at least some TN, TCM, and            TEM  populations. In
   contrast, virtually no  TEMRA  were detected in any of the V6 subsets (FIGs. lOG and 10H).
   Given these different immunophenotypes, the inventors propose that different functional
20 attributes might be attributed to the three 76 T-cell subsets.
            [00125]        y6 T-cell subset predicts interferon-y produced in response to
   tumor. 76 T cells can produce cytokines in response to activation. Therefore, a multiplex
   analysis of cytokines and chemokines was performed to determine whether aAPC-propagated
   76 T cells would foster an inflammatory environment during therapy. Phorbol myristate
25 acetate (PMA) and ionomycin were used as leukocyte activation cocktail (LAC) to mimic
   TCR activation. Cells mock-activated with media served as negative control. No significant
   production of TH2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 was observed from LAC-treated 76 T cells
   but there was a small increase in IL-10 production from baseline (FIG. 11 A). In contrast, IL
    IRA, IL-6, and IL-17 were significantly secreted by LAC-treated 76 T cells consistent with a
30 TH17 inflammatory response (FIG. 1 IB). Moreover, the pro-inflammatory THI cytokines IL
   2, IL-12 (p70), interferon-7 (IFNy), and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) were significantly
   produced by 76 T cells upon exposure to LAC compared to mock-treated controls (FIG.
    11C). The chemokines CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein-la; MIPla), CCL4
                                                    -39-

    WO 2015/061694                                                                PCT/US2014/062191
   (MIP1p), and CCL5 (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted;
   RANTES) were detected in abundance (FIG. 11lD). CCR5 binds to all three of these
   chemokines (Rostene et al., 2007), but only 6% ± 2% (mean ± SD; n = 4) of 76 T cells
   expressed this receptor. In aggregate, non-specific activation of 7 6 T cells led to a largely pro
 5 inflammatory response, as desired for cell-based immunotherapies.
           [00126]         IFNy was the most responsive of all the assessed cytokines (FIG. 1IC)
   and was chosen as a marker for 75 T-cell response to tumor. Intracellular cytokine expression
   was used to separate V6 T cell subsets by flow cytometry and assess their response to tumors
   (FIGs. 12A-C). Co-culture of aAPC-propagated/activated polyclonal 75 T cells with ovarian
10 cancer cells resulted in a hierarchy of IFNy production following V62 > V61 > V61 ""V2e,
   as shown by IFNy MFI of 855 ± 475, 242 ± 178, and 194 ± 182 (mean ± SD; n                     =  4),
   respectively (FIG. 12D). The production of IFNy was blocked with TCR7                  neutralizing
   antibody, suggesting that this cytokine response to the tumor was mediated through TCR7 in
   each of the 76 T-cell subsets (FIGs. 12D-F). These data support the premise that the cytokine
15 response was dependent on the 76 T cell subtype as identified by its TCR 7 6.
           [00127]         Polyclonal y6 T cells and V6 T cell subsets lyse a broad range of
   tumor cells. After establishing that aAPC-propagated/activated 76 T cells could be activated
   to produce pro-inflammatory mediators, the inventors examined their ability to lyse a broad
   range of tumor cell lines (FIGs. 13 and 14). Polyclonal 76 T cells displayed virtually no
20 cytolysis against autologous or allogeneic normal B cells, but were able to kill allogeneic B
   cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines RCH-ACV and cALL-2. T-cell ALL cell
   line Jurkat was also sensitive to cytolysis, suggesting that 76 T cells could be used to target
   both B-cell and T-cell malignancies. Kasumi-3 is a CD33CD34+ undifferentiated leukemia
   cell line that was killed by 76 T cells, which supports targeting minimally differentiated
25 tumors with 76 T cells. The chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line K562 and K562
   derived clone#4 aAPC were killed by polyclonal 76 T cells. Pancreatic cancer cell lines,
   BxPc-3, CaPan-2, MiaPaCa-2, and Su8686, were lysed by 76 T cells, as was the colon
   carcinoma cell line HCT- 16. Ten ovarian cell lines were killed by polyclonal 76 T cells in
   the following order of decreasing sensitivity: CAOV3 > EFO21 > UPN251 > IGROVI >
30 OC314 > Hey > A2780 > OVCAR3 > OAW42 > EF027. These cytolysis data highlight the
   ability of allogeneic polyclonal 76 T cells to specifically kill a broad range of tumors in vitro.

            [00128]        The inventors next determined the killing potential of the three
   separated 75 T-cell populations. Hematological (Jurkat) and K562 and solid (OC314 and
   CAOV3) tumor cell lines were lysed by all three V6 lineages (FIG. 15). A distinct order of
   lysis was observed for all targets with the ranking V62>>V6l"8VS2"8>V61 defining the
 5 killing potential in 4-h assays (FIG. 15). This was consistent with the T-cell differentiation
   immunophenotype as the frequency of        TEM   cells followed V62>V6l"eVS2"e>V61 (FIG.
   1OH) and    TEM  cells have been reported to possess higher effector potential relative to less
   differentiated T cells (June, 2007). Long-term assays were undertaken to assess killing after
   48 h of co-culture between the V6 subsets and tumor cells (FIG. 16). Greater than 95% of
10 CAOV3 and UPN251 tumor cells were eliminated by all three subsets within two days.
   Collectively, these data established that each V6 lineage propagated on aAPC was capable of
   lysing tumor, albeit with different efficiencies, and anti-tumor activity of the V6l"eVS2       eg
   sub-population was observed for the first time.
            [00129]        Efficiency of tumor lysis is influenced by TCR76, NKG2D, and
15 DNAM1.       The inventors sought to determine if cytolysis by T cells was directly dependent
   upon the TCR 7 by blocking receptors with antibodies. The experimental approach took into
   account that 76 T cells co-express DNAM1 and NKG2D (FIG. 17A), which can activate both
   T cells and NK cells for killing (Bauer et al., 1999; Gilfillan et al., 2008). Antibodies specific
   for NKG2D, DNAM 1, and TCR7 (clone B 1) had minimal impact on reducing lysis of Jurkat
20 and OC314 cells. In contrast, antibody blocking TCR 7 (clone IM) reduced killing of both
   Jurkat and OC314 cells (FIG. 17B). A pool of antibodies (binding NKG2D, DNAM1,
   TCR 7 ) resulted in further reduction, in a dose-dependent manner, of 76 T-cell mediated
   cytolysis of Jurkat (reduction of 65% ± 8%) and OC314 (reduction of 71% ± 10%) cells
   (FIGs. 17B and 17C). In aggregate, these results demonstrated that activation of aAPC
25 propagated/activated 76 T cells for killing is multi-factorial, but dependent on TCR 7 6.
            [00130]        Established ovarian cancer xenografts are eliminated by adoptive
   transfer of y6 T cells. The adoptive transfer of aAPC-propagated/activated polyclonal 76 T
   cells is proposed as immunotherapy for human cancer. To model this, NSG mice received an
   intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of CAOV3-efJLuc-mKate ovarian cancer cells and were then
30 randomized into treatment groups. Following eight days of engraftment, either vehicle, V61,
   V62, V61lIV62"e, or polyclonal 76 T cells were administered (escalating doses) i.p. to mice
   (FIG. 18). Tumor burden was serially monitored during the experiment with non-invasive

   mice survived ovarian cancer xenograft and hazard ratio for mice without treatment was 20.4

                                                                      "

          [00141]        This study establishes aAPC clone #4 as a cellular platform for the
5 sustained proliferation of multiple populations of y6 T cells that retain broad reactivity
                                                 - 47 -

    WO 2015/061694                                                               PCT/US2014/062191
   against hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. T cells expressing certain V6 TCR usage
   have been associated with clinical responses against cancer. For example, V61 T cells have
   not been directly infused for therapy. The inventors' data establish that these cells could
   mediate anti-tumor immunity and support the adoptive transfer of V61 T cells for cancer
 5 therapy. The inventors' propagated/activated V62 T cells exhibited the highest killing of
   tumor cells and cytokine production. A role for V6 1 "V  6 2 e,-T  cells in targeting tumors was
   previously unknown; however, the inventors' results directly show that V negV 6         2 neg cells
   exhibit anti-tumor activity, and this subset could also be of benefit to immunocompromised
   patients. In aggregate, the data herein lend impetus to adoptive transfer of y6 T cells that
10 maintain expression of all V6 TCR types as a treatment for tumors and opportunistic viral
   infections.
            [00142]       Engineered aAPC can be used to generate large numbers of y6 T cells
   that maintain polyclonal TCR repertoire and have an ability to kill tumors, but not normal
   cells. The approach to infusing polyclonal y6 T cells is further supported by the ability to of
15 aAPC generate TN, TCM, and TEM y6 T cells that exhibit a range of effector functions
   including production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and exerting direct cytotoxicity against
   tumors in vitro and in vivo. Clone #4 has been produced as a master cell bank in compliance
   with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) and provides a clear path to generating
   clinical-grade y6 T cells for human application. Clinical trials can now, for the first time, test
20 the efficacy of adoptive transfer of T cells maintaining a polyclonal repertoire of TCRy6
   therapy for both solid and hematological tumors with the potential to treat infection.
         Example 4 - Alternative protocol for the isolation and propagation of y8 T cells
            [00143]       Alternative y8 T     cell isolation procedure.           Peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patient buffy coats were depleted of CD56+ Natural Killer
25 (NK) cells and up T cells by incubating with paramagnetic microbeads and running through
   successive columns consisting of ferromagnetic spheres (Miltenyi) in the presence of a
   magnetic field.    The remaining cells, which contain y6 T cells among more numerous
   lymphocyte populations, are cultured on modified K562 activating and propagating cells
   (aAPC) in the presence of IL-2 and IL-21, resulting in the selective expansion of y6 T cells
30 (see FIG. 20).

           [00144]         This method of isolation is advantageous as both CD56 beads and
   TCRap beads are available as clinical-grade reagents.        The proposed expansion protocol
   (using aAPC in the presence of IL-2 and IL-21) is the same.
           [00145]         CD3+ T cells from fresh donor PBMC were compared to cells after
 5 expansion using the modified isolation protocol.         Initially, 76 T cells are a minority
   population in the peripheral blood.      Depletion of NK cells and UP T cells followed by
   propagation on aAPC allowed for the expansion of y6 T cells (FIG. 21).
           [00146]         The specific lysis of a pancreatic cancer cell line by 76 T cells
   expanded from PBMC following successive depletions of CD56+ and TCRaVp cells is shown
10 in FIG. 22. 76 T cells exhibited inherent activity against a pancreatic cancer cell line, while
   up T cells did not.
           Example 5 - Further alternative protocols for the propagation of yb T cells
           [00147]         76 T cells will be triggered using different anti-CD3 antibody clones
   leading to distinct outcomes (Dopfer et al, 2014). For example, clone OKT3 can be used to
15 induce cytokine production from 76 T cells and clone UCHT 1 can be used to induce greater
   cytotoxicity against target cells.
           [00148]         76 T cells will also be propagated on either aAPC loaded with OKT3,
   UCHT 1, or both antibodies in the presence of IL-2 and IL-21; or on microbeads loaded with
   OKT3, UCHT 1, or both antibodies in the presence of IL-2 and IL-2 1.
20         [00149]         The effectiveness of 76 T cells in combating various cancer cell lines
   and primary cancers in vitro and in vivo will be tested following the various expansion
   mechanisms.
