WEAR ASSEMBLY
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[01]  The present invention pertains to a wear assembly for use on various kinds of
      earth working equipment.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[02]  In mining and construction, wear parts are commonly provided along the
      digging edge of excavating equipment such as buckets for dragline machines,
      cable shovels, face shovels, hydraulic excavators, and the like. The wear parts
      protect the underlying equipment from undue wear and, in some cases, also
      perform other functions such as breaking up the ground ahead of the digging
      edge. During use, the wear parts typically encounter heavy loading and highly
      abrasive conditions. As a result, they must be periodically replaced.
[03]  These wear parts usually comprise two or more components such as a base
      that is secured to the digging edge, and a wear member that mounts on the
      base to engage the ground. The wear member tends to wear out more quickly
      and is typically replaced a number of times before the base must also be
      replaced. One example of such a wear part is an excavating tooth that is
      attached to the lip of a bucket for an excavating machine. A tooth typically
      includes an adapter secured to the lip of a bucket and a point attached to the
      adapter to initiate contact with the ground. A pin or other kind of lock is used to
      secure the point to the adapter. Improvements in strength, stability, durability,
      safety, and ease of installation and replacement are desired in such wear
      assemblies.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[04] The present invention pertains to a wear assembly for use on various kinds of
     earth working equipment including, for example, excavating machines and
     ground conveying means.
[05] In one aspect of the invention, the wear assembly includes a base with a
     supporting portion, a wear member with a cavity into which the supporting
     portion is received, and a lock to releasably secure the wear member to the
     base. The supporting portion is formed with top and bottom recesses that
     receive complementary projections of the wear member. These recesses and
     projections include aligned holes so as to receive and position the lock
     centrally within the wear assembly and remote from the wear surface. This
     arrangement shields the lock from abrasive contact with the ground and
     lessens the risk of ejection or loss of the lock.
[06] In another aspect of the present invention, the wear assembly includes a base
     with a supporting portion and a wear member with a cavity to receive the
     supporting portion. The fit between the supporting portion and the wear
     member includes stabilizing surfaces along each of the top, bottom and side
     walls in a unique configuration that creates a highly stable mounting of the
     wear member with improved penetrability.
[07] In another aspect of the present invention, the wear member includes a wear
     indicator depression that opens in the nose-receiving cavity and is initially
     closed and spaced from the external wear surface, but which breaks through
     the wear surface when it is time to replace the wear member because of wear.
[08] In another aspect of the invention, the wear member includes a hole for
     receiving the lock to secure the wear member to the base. The hole is defined
     by a wall that includes a retaining structure provided with an upper bearing

     surface and a lower bearing surface for contacting and retaining the lock
     against upward and downward movement in the hole. In one preferred
     construction, a passage is provided in the hole to enable a lock or lock
     component to fit into the hole as an integral unit and be positioned to contact
     the upper and lower bearing surfaces of the retaining structure.
[09]  In another aspect of the invention, the lock includes a mounting component
     provided with a securing structure for attachment within a hole in the wear
     member. The securing structure cooperates with a retaining structure within
     the hole to resist movement of the mounting component in and out of the hole
     during use. The mounting component defines a threaded opening for receiving
     a threaded pin that is used to releasably hold the wear member to the base.
     The separate mounting component can be easily manufactured and secured
     within the wear member for less expense and higher quality than forming the
     threads directly in the wear member. The mounting component can be
     mechanically held within the hole in the wear member to resist axial movement
     in either direction so as to avoid unintended loss of the lock.
[10]  In another aspect of the invention, the lock includes a mounting component
     received and mechanically secured into a hole in the wear member to resist
     axial movement, a locking component movably received in the mounting
     component to releasably secure a wear member to a base, and a retainer to
     prevent release of the mounting component from the wear member.
[11]  In another aspect of the invention, the lock includes threaded components that
     are mechanically secured to a hardened steel wear member. The lock
     component can be adjusted between two positions with respect to the wear
     member: a first position where the wear member can be installed or removed
     from the base, and a second position where the wear member is secured to

                                           _T
     the base by the lock. The lock is preferably securable to the wear member by
     mechanical means at the time of manufacture so that it can be shipped, stored
     and installed as an integral unit with the wear member, i.e., with the lock in a
     "ready to install" position. Once the wear member is placed onto the base, the
     lock is moved to a second position to retain the wear member in place for use
     in an earth working operation.
[12]  In another aspect of the invention, a lock for releasably securing a wear
     member to earth working equipment includes a threaded pin with a socket in
     one end for receiving a tool to rotate the pin. The socket includes facets for
     receiving the tool, and a clearance space in lieu of one of the facets to better
     avoid and clean out earthen fines from the socket.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
[57] The present invention pertains to a wear assembly for various kinds of earth
     working equipment including, for example, excavating equipment and ground
     conveying equipment. Excavating equipment is intended as a general term to
     refer to any of a variety of excavating machines used in mining, construction
     and other activities, and which, for example, include dragline machines, cable
     shovels, face shovels, hydraulic excavators, and dredge cutters. Excavating
     equipment also refers to the ground-engaging components of these machines
     such as the bucket or the cutter head. The digging edge is that portion of the
     equipment that leads the contact with the ground. One example of a digging
     edge is the lip of a bucket. Ground conveying equipment is also intended as a
     general term to refer to a variety of equipment that is used to convey earthen
     material and which, for example, includes chutes and mining truck beds. The

     present invention is suited for use along the digging edge of excavating
     equipment in the form of, for example, excavating teeth and shrouds.
     Additionally, certain aspects of the present invention are also suited for use
     along the expanse of a wear surface in the form of, for example, runners.
[58] Relative terms such as front, rear, top, bottom and the like are used for
     convenience of discussion. The terms front or forward are generally used to
     indicate the normal direction of travel during use (e.g., while digging), and
     upper or top are generally used as a reference to the surface over which the
     material   passes when,       for example, it is gathered     into the bucket.
     Nevertheless, it is recognized that in the operation of various earth working
     machines the wear assemblies may be oriented in various ways and move in
     all kinds of directions during use.
[59] In one example, a wear assembly 14 in accordance with the present invention
     is an excavating tooth that attaches to a lip 15 of a bucket (Figs. 1, 2 and 14).
     The illustrated tooth 14 includes an adapter 19 welded to lip 15, an
     intermediate adapter 12 mounted on adapter 19, and a point (also called a tip)
     10 mounted on base 12. While one tooth construction is shown, other tooth
     arrangements using some or all of the aspects of the invention are possible.
     For example, adapter 19 in this embodiment is welded to lip 15, but it could be
     mechanically attached (e.g., by a Whisler-style lock assembly). In addition, the
     base could be an integral portion of the excavating equipment rather than a
     separately attached component For example, adapter 19 could be replaced by
     an integral nose of a cast lip. Although in this application, for purposes of
     explanation, the intermediate adapter 12 is referred to as the base and the
     point 10 as the wear member, the intermediate adapter 12 could be
     considered the wear member and the adapter 19 the base.

[60] Adapter 19 includes a pair of legs 21, 23 that straddle lip 15, and a forwardly
     projecting nose 18. The intermediate adapter 12 includes a rearwardly
     opening cavity 17 to receive nose 18 at the front end of adapter 19 (Figs. 1, 2,
     5 and 14). Cavity 17 and nose 18 are preferably configured as disclosed in US
     Patent 7,882,649 which is incorporated herein by reference, but other nose
     and cavity constructions could be used. Adapter 12 includes a forwardly
     projecting nose 48 to mount point 10. Point 10 includes a rearwardly-opening
     cavity 26 to receive nose 48, and a front end 24 to penetrate the ground. Lock
      16 is used to secure wear member 10 to base 12, and base 12 to nose 18
     (Figs. 1, 2 and 14). In this example, the locks to secure both the wear member
      10 to base 12, and the base 12 to nose 18 are the same. Nevertheless, they
     could be dimensioned differently, have different constructions, or could be
     completely different locks. With the use of an intermediate adapter, the tooth is
     well suited for use on larger machines, but could also be used on smaller
     machines. As an alternative, a point as the wear member could be secured
     directly onto adapter 19 as the base.
[61] Wear member 10, in this embodiment, has a generally wedge-shaped
     configuration with a top wall 20 and a bottom wall 22 that converge to a narrow
     front end 24 to engage and penetrate the ground during operation of the
     equipment (Figs. 1, 2 and 8-14). A cavity 26 opens in the rear end 28 of wear
     member 10 for receiving base 12. Cavity 26 preferably includes a front end
     portion 30 and a rear end portion 32. The front or working portion 27 of wear
     member 10 is that portion forward of cavity 26. The rear or mounting portion
     29 of wear member 10 Is that portion that includes cavity 26.
[62] The front end portion 30 of cavity 26 (Figs. 10-13) includes upper and lower
     stabilizing surfaces 34, 36. Stabilizing surfaces 34, 36 axially extend

     substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis 42 of cavity 26 for improved
     stability under vertical loads (i.e., loads that include a vertical component). The
     term "substantially parallel" in this application means actually parallel or at a
     small diverging angle (i.e.., about 7 degrees or less). Accordingly, stabilizing
     surfaces 34, 36 axially extend at an angle of about 7 degrees or less to
     longitudinal axis 42. Preferably, the stabilizing surfaces axially diverge
     rearwardly from the longitudinal axis at an angle of about five degrees or less,
     and most preferably at an angle of 2-3 degrees.
[63] Stabilizing surfaces 34, 36 oppose and bear against complementary stabilizing
     surfaces 44, 46 on the nose 48 of base 12 (Fig. 24). Stabilizing surfaces 44,
     46 are also substantially parallel to longitudinal axis 42 when the components
     are assembled together (Figs. 3-7, 14-16 and 24). The bearing of stabilizing
     surfaces 34, 36 in cavity 26 against stabilizing surfaces 44, 46 on nose 48
     provides a stable mounting of wear member 10 under vertical loads. Vertical
     loads applied to the front end 24 of wear member 10 urge the wear member (if
     not restricted by the nose and lock) to roll forward and off of the nose.
     Stabilizing surfaces (i.e., surfaces that are substantially parallel to the
     longitudinal axis 42) resist this urge more effectively than surfaces with greater
     axial inclinations, and provide a more stable mounting of wear member 10 on
     nose 48. A more stable mounting enables the use of a smaller lock and results
     in less internal wear between the parts.
[64] Front end portion 30 of cavity 26 further includes side bearing surfaces 39, 41
     to contact complementary side bearing surfaces 45, 47 on nose 48 to resist
     side loads (i.e., loads with a side component). Side bearing surfaces 39, 41 in
     cavity 26 and side bearing surfaces 45, 47 on nose 48 preferably axially
     extend substantially parallel to longitudinal axis 42 for greater stability in the

     mounting of wear member 10. These front side bearing surfaces 39, 41, 45, 47
     cooperate with rear bearing surfaces that also resist side loads (as discussed
     below). In the preferred embodiment, the front bearing surfaces 34, 36, 39, 41
     in cavity 26 are each formed with slight lateral concave curvature for better
     resisting shifting loads and loads from all directions. Front bearing surfaces
     44-47 on nose 48 would have a complementary convex configuration. The
     front bearing surfaces in cavity 26 and on nose 48 could, however, be flat or
     formed with a different curvature.
[65] Nose 48 of base 12 includes a rear or main portion 50 rearward of stabilizing
     surfaces 44, 46 of the front end 52 (Figs. 3-7 and 14-20); the nose 48 is
     considered that portion of adapter 12 that is received into cavity 26 of wear
     member 10. The main portion 50 generally has a "dog bone" configuration in
     cross section (Figs. 18-20) with a narrower central section 54 and larger or
     thicker side sections 56. Such         a construction    resembles     an   I-beam
     construction in function, and provides an attractive balance of strength with
     reduced mass and weight. In the preferred embodiment, side sections 56 are
     the mirror image of each other. The side sections 56 gradually increase in
     thickness from front to back for increased strength and reduced stress in the
     design. The use of a nose 48 having a narrow center section 54 and enlarged
     side sections 56 provides the dual benefit of (i) the nose 48 having sufficient
     strength to withstand the heavy loading that may be encountered during
     operation, and (ii) positioning the lock 16 at a central location in the wear
     assembly 14 to shield it from abrasive contact with the ground during use and
     to reduce the risk of lock ejection. The central section 54 preferably represents
     about the central two thirds or less of the overall thickness (i.e., height) of the
     nose 48 along the same lateral plane. In a most preferred embodiment, the

                                            I I
     thickness of central section 54 is about 60% or less of the largest or overall
     thickness of nose 48 along the same lateral plane.
[66] Central section 54 is defined by a top surface 58 and a bottom surface 60. Top
     and bottom surfaces 58, 60 preferably axially extend substantially parallel to
     longitudinal axis 42, but they could have a greater inclination. Top surface 58,
     on each side, blends into an inner surface 62 on side sections 56. Inner
     surfaces 62 are laterally inclined upward and outward from top surface 58 to
     partially define the upper part of side sections 56. Likewise, inner surfaces 64
     are laterally inclined downward and outward from bottom surface 60 to
     partially define the lower part of side sections 56. Inner surfaces 62 are each
     laterally inclined to top surface 58 at an angle a of about 130-140 degrees to
     resist both vertical and side loading on wear member 10, and reduce stress
     concentrations during loading (Fig. 20). However, they could be at an angle
     outside of this range (e.g., about 105-165 degrees) if desired. Inner surfaces
     64 are preferably mirror images of inner surfaces 62, but they could be
     different if desired. The preferred ranges of inclinations are the same for both
     sets of inner surfaces 62, 64. The most preferred inclination for each inner
     surface 62, 64 is at an angle a of 135 degrees. In some constructions, it may
     be preferred to have each inner surface 62, 64 inclined at an angle a of more
     than 135 degrees to the adjacent top or bottom surface to provide greater
     resistance to vertical loads. Inner surfaces 62, 64 are preferably stabilizing
     surfaces that each axially extend substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis
     42 to better resist vertical loads and provide a stable mounting of the wear
     member 10 on base 12.
[67] A central hole 66 is formed in central section 54 that opens in top and bottom
     surfaces 58, 60 (Figs. 3, 5, 7, 19, 25 and 29), though it could open only in top

                                           IC._
     surface 58 if desired. The downward extension of hole 66 through bottom
     surface 60 reduces the build-up of earthen fines in the hole and enables an
     easier cleaning out of the fines in the hole. Top wall 20 of wear member 10
     includes a through-hole 67 that aligns with hole 66 when wear member 10 is
     mounted on nose 48 (Figs. 1, 9, 10A, 13, 14, 25 and 29). Lock 16 is received
     into the holes 66, 67 to hold wear member 10 to base 12 (Figs. 25, 29 and 30).
     The details of preferred lock 16 are provided below. However, other locks
     could be used to secure wear member 10 to base 12. As examples, alternative
     locks could be in the form disclosed in U.S. Patent 7,578,081 or U.S. Patent
     5,068,986, each of which are incorporated herein by reference. The shape of
     the aligned holes in the wear member and the base in instances of using
     alternative locks would, of course, be different than illustrated herein to
     accommodate the different locks.
[68] Hole 67 in wear member 10 is defined by a wall 68 that preferably surrounds
     the lock 16 (Fig. 31). Wall 68 includes a retaining structure 69 that extends
     laterally along part of the wall to define an upper bearing surface 71 and a
     lower bearing surface 73. Bearing surfaces 71, 73 are each contacted by lock
      16 to hold the lock in the hole and resist inward and outward vertical forces
     applied to the lock during shipping, storage, installation and use of the wear
     member so as to better resist lock ejection or loss. In a preferred embodiment,
     retaining structure 69 is formed as a radial projection extending into hole 66
     from wall 68 wherein the bearing surfaces 71, 73 are formed as upper and
     lower shoulders. Alternatively, retaining structure 69 could be formed as a
     recess (not shown) in perimeter wall 68 with upper and lower bearing surfaces
     that face each other. A passage 75 is provided vertically along wall 68 in hole
     67 to enable the insertion of lock 16 and the engagement of retaining structure

                                            I I.,
     69, i.e., with lock 16 in bearing contact with both the upper and lower bearing
     surfaces 71, 73. In the illustrated embodiment, no hole is formed in the bottom
     wall 22 of the wear member 10; but a hole could be so formed to enable
     reversible mounting of point 10. Also, if desired, base 12 could be reversibly
     mounted on nose 18 if the fit between the base 12 and nose 18 permit it. In
     the illustrated embodiment, base 12 cannot be reversibly mounted on nose 18.
[69]  In a preferred embodiment, retaining structure 69 is essentially a continuation
     of wall 68 that is defined by a first relief 77 above or outside of the retaining
     structure 69, a second relief 79 below or inside of the retaining structure 69,
     and passage 75 at the distal end 81 of retaining structure 69. Reliefs 77, 79
     and passage 75, then, define a continuous recess 83 in perimeter wall 68
     about retaining structure 69. The end walls 87, 89 of reliefs 77, 79 define stops
     for the positioning of lock 16. A recess 85 is preferably provided along an
     inside surface 91 of cavity 26 to function as a stop during the insertion of a
     mounting component of lock 16 as described below.
[70] Cavity 26 in wear member 10 has a shape that complements nose 48 {Figs. 9,
      10, 10A, 24-26 and 29). Accordingly, the rear end 32 of the cavity includes an
     upper projection 74 and a lower projection 76 that are received into the upper
     and lower recesses 70, 72 in nose 48. Upper projection 74 includes an inside
     surface 78 that opposes top surface 58 on nose 48, and side surfaces 80 that
     oppose and bear against inner surfaces 62 on nose 48. Preferably there is a
     gap between inside surface 78 and top surface 58 to ensure contact between
     side surfaces 80 and inner surfaces 62, but they could be in contact if desired.
     Side surfaces 80 are laterally inclined to match the lateral inclination of inner
     surfaces 62. Side surfaces 80 axially extend substantially parallel to the
     longitudinal axis 42 to match the axial extension of inner surfaces 62.

                                             I-r
[71] Lower projection 76 is preferably the mirror image of upper projection 74, and
     includes an inside surface 82 to oppose bottom surface 60, and side surfaces
     84 to oppose and bear against inner surfaces 64. In cavity 26, then, inside
     surface 78 faces inside surface 82 with gap 86 in between the two inside
     surfaces 78, 82 that is slightly larger than the thickness of central section 54 of
     nose 48. The thickness (or height) of gap 86 is preferably within the middle
     two thirds of the overall thickness (or height) of the cavity (i.e., the largest
     height) 26 along the same lateral plane, and is most preferred within the
     middle 60% or less of the overall thickness of the cavity along the same lateral
     plane. Side surfaces 80, 84 are laterally inclined away from the respective
     inside surfaces 78, 82, and axially extending substantially parallel to the
     longitudinal axis 42 to define upper and lower rear stabilizing surfaces for the
     point. The front stabilizing surfaces 34, 36 cooperate with rear stabilizing
     surfaces 80, 84 to stably support wear member 10 on nose 48. For example, a
     downward vertical load Li on the front end 24 of wear member 10 (Fig. 2) is
     primarily resisted by front stabilizing surface 34 in cavity 26 bearing against
     front stabilizing surface 44 on nose 48, and rear stabilizing surfaces 84 in
     cavity 26 bearing against rear stabilizing surfaces 64 on nose 48 (Figs. 24-26
     and 29). The axial extension of these stabilizing surfaces 34, 44, 64, 86 (i.e.,
     that they are axially substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis 42) minimizes
     the forward, downward tendency to roll that load Li urges on wear member
      10. Likewise, an opposite upward load L2 on front end 24 (Fig. 2) would be
     primarily resisted by front stabilizing surface 36 in cavity 26 bearing against
     front stabilizing surface 46 on nose 48, and rear stabilizing surfaces 80 in
     cavity 26 bearing against rear stabilizing surfaces 62 on nose 48 (Figs. 24-26

                                           I %J
     and 29). In the same way as noted above, stabilizing surfaces 36, 46, 62, 84
     stably support wear member 10 on base 12.
[72] The bearing contact between side surfaces 80 and inner surfaces 62, and
     between side surfaces 84 and inner surfaces 64, resists both vertical loads
     and loads with lateral components (called side loads). It is advantageous for
     the same surfaces to resist both vertical and side loads because loads are
     commonly applied to wear members in shifting directions as they are forced
     through the ground. With the laterally inclined stabilizing surfaces, bearing
     between the same surfaces can continue to occur even if a load shifts, for
     example, from more of a vertical load to more of a side load. With this
     arrangement, movement of the point on the nose is lessened, which leads to
     reduced wearing of the components.
[73] A hollow portion 88, 90 is provided to each side of each of the upper and lower
     projections 74, 76 in cavity 26 for receiving side sections 56 of nose 48 (Figs.
     9, 10, 12, 13, 25, 26 and 29). The hollow portions 88, 90 complement and
     receive side sections 56. The upper hollow portions 88 are defined by side
     surfaces 80 on projection 74, and outer surfaces 92. The lower hollow portions
     90 are defined by side surfaces 84 of projection 76, and outer surfaces 94.
     Outer surfaces 92, 94 are generally curved and/or angular in shape to
     complement the top, bottom and outside surfaces of the side sections 56.
[74]  In the preferred construction, each sidewall 100 of nose 48 is provided with a
     channel 102 (Figs. 18-20). Each channel Is preferably defined by inclined
     channel walls 104, 106 giving the channel a generally V-shaped configuration.
     Channels 102 each preferably has a bottom wall 107 to avoid a sharp interior
     corner, but they could be formed without a bottom wall (i.e., with a blend
     joining walls 104, 106) if desired. Channel wails 104, 106 are each preferably

                                             I NJ
     inclined to resist both vertical and side loads. In a preferred construction, the
     channel walls 104, 106 diverge to define an included angle     p of about 80-100
     degrees (preferably about 45 degrees to each side of a central horizontal
     plane), though the angle could be outside of this range. Channel walls 104,
     106 preferably each axially extend parallel to the longitudinal axis 42.
[75] The opposite sides 98 of cavity 26 define projections 108 that complement and
     are received into channels 102. Projections 108 include bearing walls 110, 112
     that oppose and bear against channel walls 104, 106 to resist vertical and side
     loading. Projections 108 preferably extend the length of sidewalls 98, but they
     could be shorter and received in only portions of channels 102. Bearing walls
     110, 112 preferably match the lateral inclination of channel walls 104, 106, and
     axially extend substantially parallel to longitudinal axis 42.
[76] While any opposing parts of the wear member 10 and base 12 may engage
     one another during use, the engagement of surfaces 34, 36, 44, 46, 62, 64,
     80, 84, 104, 106, 110, 112 are intended to the primary bearing surfaces to
     resist both vertical and side loading. The contact of front wall 114 of cavity 26
     against front face 116 of nose 48 are intended to be the primary bearing
     surfaces resisting axial loads (i.e., loads with components that are parallel to
     longitudinal axis 42).
[77] Wear member 10 preferably Includes laterally spaced recesses 123, 125 in
     top wall 20 and corresponding laterally spaced recesses 127, 129 in bottom
     wall 22 at the rear end 28 (Figs. 1, 2, 10, 14 and 26). Nose 48 preferably
     includes cooperative recesses 130, 132, 134, 136 (Figs. 1-3, 5, 6 and 26) that
     are laterally offset from recesses 123, 125, 127, 129 on wear member 10 so
     that the rear end 28 of wear member 10 interlocks with the rear end 138 of
     nose 48 (Figs. 1, 2 and 26). Side segments 124 of wear member 10 are

                                           I I
     received in side recesses 130, 136 of base 12, top segment 126 of wear
     member 10 is received in top recess 132 in base 12, and bottom segment 128
     of wear member 10 is received in bottom recess 134 of base 12 when the
     wear member is fully seated on nose 48. Likewise, the lower and upper base
     segments 140, 142 are received in cooperative recesses 123, 125, 127, 129 of
     wear member 10. This interlocked engagement of wear member 10 and base
     12 resists loads during use. Nevertheless, other constructions could be used
     or the interlocking construction could be omitted, i.e., with rear end 28 having
     a continuous construction without recesses 123, 125, 127, 129.
[78] Wear member 10 preferably includes a wear indicator depression 170 that
     opens in cavity 26 (Fig. 26). In the illustrated example, wear indicator
     depression 170 is a slot formed in bottom wall 22 proximate rear end 28,
     though other positions can be used. Depression 170 has a bottom surface 172
     to define a depth that is spaced from wear surface 13 when wear member 10
     is new. When depression 172 breaks through wear surface 13 during use, it
     provides a visual indicator to the operator that it is time to replace wear
     member.
[79] Locks 16 are preferably used to secure wear member 10 to base 12, and base
     12 to nose 18 (Figs. 1, 2 and 14). In the preferred construction, one lock 16 in
     top wall 20 is provided to hold wear member 10 to base 12, and one lock 16 in
     each side wall 151 of base 12 is provided to hold base 12 to adapter 19.
     Alternatively, two locks could be used to secure wear member 10 to base 12
     and one lock to hold base 12 to adapter 19. A hole 146 is provided on each
     side 151 of base 12 for receiving the respective lock 16. Each hole 146, then,
     has the same construction as described above for hole 67. Further, a hole
     161, like hole 66, is provided in the opposite sides 163 of nose 18. Holes 161

     are preferably closed, but could be interconnected through nose 18. The locks
     though could have a wide variety of constructions. The lock securing base 12
     to nose 18 could, for example, be constructed such as disclosed in U.S.
     Patent 5,709,043.
[80] Lock 16 includes a mounting component or collar 222 and a retaining
     component or pin 220 (Figs. 27-44). Collar 222 fits in hole 67 of wear member
     10 and includes a bore or opening 223 with threads 258 for receiving pin 220
     with matching threads 254. A retainer 224, preferably in the form of a retaining
     clip, is inserted in hole 67 with collar 222 to prevent disengagement of the
     collar 222 from wear member 10. Preferably, retainer 224 is inserted during
     manufacture of wear member 10 so that lock 16 is integrally coupled with wear
     member 10 (i.e., to define a wear member that integrally includes a lock) for
     shipping, storage, installation and/or use of the wear member. Such a
     construction reduces inventory and storage needs, eliminates dropping the
     lock during installation (which can be particularly problematic at night),
     ensures the proper lock is always used, and eases the installation of the wear
     member. Nevertheless, if desired, retainer 224 could be removed at any time
     to effect removal of lock 16.
[81] Collar 222 has a cylindrical body 225 with lugs 236, 237 that project outward
     to contact and bear against bearing surfaces or shoulders 71, 73 of retaining
     structure 69 to hold lock 16 in place in wear member 10. To install collar 222,
     body 225 is inserted into hole 67 from within cavity 26 such that lugs 236, 237
     is slid along passage or slot 75, and then rotated so that lugs 236, 237
     straddle retaining structure 69 (Figs. 32 and 33). Collar 222 is preferably
     translated into hole 67 until flange 241 is received in recess 85 and abuts
     against wall 93 of recess 85 (Fig. 32). Collar 222 is then rotated until lugs 236,

                                             I1
     237 abut stops 87, 89 (Fig. 33). The rotation of collar 222 is preferably
     approximately 30 degrees so that lugs 236, 237 move into upper reliefs 77, 79
     and abut stops 87, 89. Other stop arrangements are possible, e.g., the collar
     could have a formation abut end wall 81 or have only one lug engage the stop.
      In this position, lug 236 sets against upper bearing surface or shoulder 71, and
     lug 237 against lower bearing surface or shoulder 73. The engagement of lugs
     236, 237 against both sides of retaining structure 69 hold collar 222 in hole 67
     even under load during digging. Further, the cooperation of outer lug 236 and
     flange 241 provide a resistive couple against cantilever loads applied to pin
     220 during use.
[82] Once collar 222 is in place, a retainer or clip 224 is inserted into passage 75
     from outside wear member 10 (Fig. 34). Preferably, retainer 224 is snap-fit into
     slot 75, thereby preventing rotation of collar 222 so that lugs 236, 237 are
     retained in reliefs 77, 79 and against shoulders 71, 73. Retainer 224 is
     preferably formed of sheet steel with a bent tab 242 that snaps into a receiving
     notch 244 on an outer surface 246 of collar 222 to retain retainer 224 in wear
     member 10 (Figs. 35 and 36). The retainer allows collar 222 to be locked in
     wear member 10 for secure storage, shipping, installation and/or use, and
     thereby define an integral part of wear member 10. Furthermore, retainer 224
     preferably exerts a spring force against collar 222 to bias collar 222 to tighten
     the fit of collar 222 in hole 67. A flange 267 is preferably provided to abut lug
     236 and prevent over- insertion of the retainer.
[83] The engagement of lugs 236, 237 against shoulders 71, 73 mechanically hold
     collar 222 in hole 67 and effectively prevent inward and outward movement
     during shipping, storage, installation and/or use of wear member 10. A
     mechanical attachment is preferred because the hard, low alloy steel

     commonly used to manufacture wear members for earth working equipment
     generally lacks sufficient weldability. Collar 222 is preferably a single unit (one
     piece or assembled as a unit), and preferably a one piece construction for
     strength and simplicity. Retainer 224 is preferably formed of sheet steel as it
     does not resist the heavy loads applied during used. Retainer 224 is used only
     to prevent undesired rotation of collar 222 in hole 67 so as to prevent release
     of lock 16 from wear member 10.
[84] Pin 220 includes a head 247 and a shank 249 (Figs. 28-30, 34 and 37-40).
     Shank 249 is formed with threads 254 along a portion of its length from head
     247. Pin end 230 is preferably unthreaded for receipt into hole 66 in nose 48.
     Pin 220 is installed into collar 222 from outside wear member so that pin end
     230 is the leading end and pin threads 254 engage collar threads 258. A hex
     socket (or other tool-engaging formation) 248 is formed in head 247, at the
     trailing end, for receipt of a tool T to turn pin 220 in collar 222.
[85] Preferably, hex socket 248 is provided with a clearance opening 250 in place
     of one facet (i.e., only five facets 280 are provided), to define a cleanout region
     (Figs. 27, 28, 34 and 37-40). Cleanout region 250 makes the resulting opening
     larger, and therefore less likely to retain impacted fines and grit that often
     packs such pockets and openings on ground-engaging portions of earth
     working equipment. Cleanout region 250 also provides alternate locations to
     insert tools to break up and pry out compacted fines. For example, a sharp
     chisel, pick, or power tool implement may be shoved, pounded, or driven into
     cleanout region 250 to begin breaking up compacted fines. Should any
     damage occur to the interior surfaces of cleanout region 250 during the
     process, the damage generally has no impact on the five active tool faces of
     hex engagement hole 48. Once some of the compacted fines are broken out

                                            C. I
     of cleanout region 250, any compacted fines inside hex engagement hole 248
     may be attacked from the side or at an angle, as accessed through cleanout
     region 250.
[86] An additional benefit of a lobe-shaped cleanout region is that the combination
     of a hex socket with a lobe-shaped cleanout region on one facet of the hex
     socket also creates a multiple-tool interface for pin 20. For example, a hex
     socket sized for use with a 7/8-inch hex drive T (Fig. 38), when elongated on
     one face, will allow a 3/4-inch square drive T1 to fit (Fig. 39) as well. Optimal fit
     for such a square drive is obtained by forming a groove 251 in one facet of hex
     socket 248, opposite cleanout region 250. Other tools may fit as well, such as
     pry bars, if needed in the field when a hex tool is not available.
[87]  In one preferred embodiment, threaded pin 220 includes a biased latching
     tooth or detent 252, biased to protrude beyond the surrounding thread 254
     (Figs. 29, 30 and 34). A corresponding outer pocket or recess 256 is formed in
     the thread 258 of collar 222 to receive detent 252, so that threaded pin 220
     latches into a specific position relative to collar 222 when latching detent 252
     aligns and inserts with outer pocket 256. The engagement of latching detent
     252 in outer pocket 256 holds threaded pin 220 in a release position relative to
     collar 22, which holds pin 220 outside of cavity 26 (or at least outside of hole
     66 with sufficient clearance on nose 48), so that the wear member 10 can be
     installed on (and removed from) nose 48. The pin is preferably shipped and
     stored in the release position so that wear member 10 is ready to install.
     Preferably, latching detent 252 is located at the start of the thread on threaded
     pin 220, near the pin end 230. Outer pocket 256 is located approximately 1/2
     rotation from the start of the thread on collar 222. As a result, pin 220 will latch
     into shipping position after approximately 1/2 turn of pin 220 within collar 222.

[88] Further application of torque to pin 220 will squeeze latching detent 252 out of
     outer pocket 256. An inner pocket or recess 260 is formed at the inner end of
     the thread of collar 222. Preferably, the thread 258 of collar 222 ends slightly
     before inner pocket 260. This results in an increase of resistance to turning pin
     220 as pin 220 is threaded into collar 222, when latching detent 252 is forced
     out of thread 258. This is followed by a sudden decrease of resistance to
     turning pin 220, as latching detent 252 aligns with and pops into the inner
     pocket. In use, there is a noticeable click or "thunk" as pin 220 reaches an end
     of travel within collar 222. The combination of the increase in resistance, the
     decrease in resistance, and the "thunk" provides haptic feedback to a user that
     helps a user determine that pin 220 is fully latched in the proper service
     position. This haptic feedback results in more reliable installations of wear
     parts using the present combined collar and pin assembly, because an
     operator is trained to easily identify the haptic feedback as verification that pin
     220 is in the desired position to retain wear member 10 on base 12. The use
     of a detent 252 enables pin 220 to stop at the desired position with each
     installation unlike traditional threaded locking arrangements.
[89] Preferably, latching detent 252 may be formed of sheet steel, held In place
     within a sump 262 within pin 220, resiliently fixed in place inside an elastomer
     264. Sump 262 extends to open into cleanout region 250. The elastomer
     contained in sump 262 also may extend into cleanout region 250, when
     latching detent 252 is compressed during rotation of pin 220. Conversely, the
     elastomer contained in sump 262 forms a compressible floor for cleanout
     region 250, which may aid in the breakup and removal of compacted fines
     from cleanout region 250. Elastomer 264 may be molded around latching
     detent 252 so that elastomer 264 hardens in place and bonds to latching

     detent 252. The resulting subassembly of detent 252 and elastomer 264 may
     be pressed into place through cleanout region 250, and into sump 262. A
     preferred construction of latching detent 252 includes a body 266, a protrusion
     268, and guide rails 270. Protrusion 268 bears against a wall of sump 262,
     which keeps latching detent 252 in proper location relative to thread 254.
     Guide    rails  270   further support    latching  detent 252,      while allowing
     compression of latching detent 252 into sump 262, as discussed above.
[90] When pin 220 is installed into collar 222, it is rotated 1/2 turn to the release
     position for shipping, storage and/or installation of wear member 10. The wear
     member containing integrated lock 16 is installed onto nose 48 of base 12
     (Fig. 29). Pin 220 is then preferably rotated 2 1/2 turns until pin end 230 is fully
     received into hole 66 in the locked or service position (Fig. 30). More or fewer
     rotations of threaded pin 220 may be needed, depending on the pitch of the
     threads, and on whether more than one start is provided for the threads. The
     use of a particularly coarse thread requiring only three full rotations of
     threaded pin 220 for full locking of a wear member 10 to base 12 has been
     found to be easy to use in field conditions, and reliable for use under the
     extreme conditions of excavation. Furthermore, the use of a coarse helical
     thread is better in installations where the lock assembly will become
     surrounded by compacted fines during use.
[91] Lock 16 is located within the upper recess 70 between side sections 56 for
     protection against contact with the ground and wear during use (Fig. 25 and
     30). The positioning of lock 16 deep in wear assembly 14 helps shield the lock
     from wear caused by the ground passing over wear member 10. Preferably,
     lock 16 is recessed with hole 67 so that it remains shielded from moving
     earthen material over the life of the wear member, in a preferred example, pin

     220 in the locked position is in the bottom 7096 or lower in hole 67. Earthen
     material will tend to accumulate in hole 67 above lock 10 and protect the lock
     from undue wear even as wear member 10 wears. Further, the lock is
     generally centrally located in wear assembly with pin end 230 located at or
     proximate the center of hole 66 in the locked position. Positioning the lock
     closer to the center of nose 18 will tend to reduce ejection loads applied to the
     lock during use of the wear member, and especially with vertical loads that
     tend to rock the wear member on the base.
[92] Pin 20 may be released using a ratchet tool or other tool to unscrew pin 220
     from collar 222. While pin 220 can be removed from collar 222, it need only be
     backed up to the release position. Wear member 10 can then be removed
     from nose 48. The torque of unscrewing pin 220 may exert substantial torsion
     loads on collar 222, which loads are resisted by stops 77 and 79, providing a
     strong and reliable stop for lugs 236 and 237.
[93] The mounting component 222 of lock 16 defines a threaded bore 223 for
     receiving a threaded securing pin 220 that is used to releasably hold wear
     member 10 to base 12 (and base 12 to adapter 19). The separate mounting
     component 222 can be easily machined or otherwise formed with threads, and
     secured within the wear member for less expense and higher quality threads
     as compared to forming the threads directly in the wear member. The steel
     used for wear member 10 are very hard and it is difficult to cast or otherwise
     form screw threads into hole 67 for the intended locking operation. The
     relatively large size of wear member 10 also makes it more difficult to cast or
     otherwise form screw threads in hole 67. The mounting component 222 can be
     mechanically held within the hole in the wear member to resist axial movement
     in either direction (i.e., that is in and out of hole 67) during use so as to better

     resist unintended loss of the lock during shipping, storage, installation and
     use. On account of the hard steel typically used for wear member 10,
     mounting component 222 could not be easily welded into hole 67.
[94] The use of a lock in accordance with the present invention provides many
     benefits: (i) a lock integrated into a wear member so that the lock ships and
     stores in a ready to install position for less inventory and easier installation; (ii)
     a lock that requires only common drive tools such as a hex tool or ratchet
     driver for operation, and requires no hammer; (iii) a lock with easy tool access;
     (iv) a lock with clear visual and haptic confirmation of correct installation; (v) a
     new lock provided with each wear part; (vi) a lock that is positioned for easy
     access; (vii) a lock with a simple intuitive universally understood operation; (vii)
     a permanent        mechanical connection      between    components    of differing
     geometric complexity creates a finished product with features and benefits
     extracted from specific manufacturing processes; (viii) a lock integration
     system built around simple castable feature where the integration supports
     high loads, requires no special tools or adhesives and creates a permanent
     assembly; (ix) a lock with a hex engagement hole elongated on one facet
     allowing easier cleanout of soil fines with simple tools; (x) a lock located with a
     central part of the wear assembly to protect the lock from wear and reduce the
     risk of lock ejection; (xi) a lock with reaction lugs on the lock collar to carry
     system loads perpendicular to bearing faces; (xii) a retaining clip installed at
     the manufacturing source that holds the collar into the wear member while
     also biasing the collar against the load bearing interface and taking slack out
     of the system; (xiii) a design approach that simplifies casting complexity while
     supporting expanded product functionality; (xiv) a design approach whereby
     critical fit surfaces in the lock area need only be ground to fit one part which

     could act as a gage; and (xv) a design that fits within standard plant
     processes.
[95] Lock 16 is a coupling arrangement for securing two separable components in
     an excavating operation. The system consists of a pin 220 received in a hole
     66 in a base 12 and a collar 222 mechanically retained in the wear member
      10. The collar contains features supportive of integrated shipment, load
     transmission, lock installation and lock removal. The collar is secured to the
     wear member with a retainer 224 which acts upon two lugs 236, 237 at the
     perimeter of the collar maintaining the lugs in an optimal load bearing
     orientation. The retainer also tightens the fit between components. The pin
     220 helically advances through the center of the collar 222 between two low
     energy positions created by an elastomer backed latching mechanism. The
     first position keeps 1/2 turn of thread engaged between the collar and the pin
     for retention during shipment. The pin 220 advances into the second low
     energy position after rotating 2 1/2 turns ending in a hard stop signaling that
     the system is locked. When the wear member 10 requires changing, the pin
     220 is rotated counter-clockwise and removed from the assembly allowing the
     wear member to slide free from the base.
[96] While the illustrated embodiment is an excavating tooth, the features
     associated with the locking of wear member 10 on base 12 can be used in a
     wide variety of wear assemblies for earth working equipment. For example,
     runners can be formed with a hole, like hole 67, and mechanically secured to a
     base defined on the side of a large bucket, a chute surface, a bed of a truck
     body and the like.
