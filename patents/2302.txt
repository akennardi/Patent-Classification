                                 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0001]           The invention relates to selective binding agents for dickkopf-1 (DKK1) protein,
and more particularly, to antibodies and antigen binding domains and CDR regions that mediate
selective binding to DKK1 proteins.
                           BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[00021          Two or three distinct phases of changes to bone mass occur over the life of an
individual (see Riggs, West J. Med. 154:63 77 (1991)). The first phase occurs in both men and
women and proceeds to attainment of a peak bone mass. This is achieved through linear growth
of the endochondral growth plates and radial growth due to a rate of periosteal apposition. The
second phase begins around age 30 for trabecular bone (flat bones more commonly found in the
vertebrae and pelvis) and about age 40 for cortical bone (e.g., predominantly found in long bones
such as in the limbs) and continues to old age. This phase is characterized by slow bone loss and
occurs in both men and women. In women, a third phase of bone loss also occurs, most likely
due to postmenopausal estrogen deficiencies. During this phase alone, women may lose an
additional bone mass from the cortical bone and from the trabecular compartment (see Riggs,
supra).
[00031           Loss of bone mineral content can be caused by a wide variety of conditions and
may result in significant medical problems. For example, osteoporosis is a debilitating disease in
humans and is characterized by marked decreases in skeletal bone mass and mineral density,
structural deterioration of bone, including degradation of bone microarchitecture and
                                                  -1 -

    WO 20121058393                                                           PCT/US20111/058025

corresponding increases in bone fragility (i.e., decreases in bone strength), and susceptibility to
fracture in afflicted individuals. Osteoporosis in humans is generally preceded by clinical
osteopenia (bone mineral density that is greater than one standard deviation but less than 2.5
standard deviations below the mean value for young adult bone), a condition found in
approximately 25 million people in the United States. Another 7 8 million patients in the United
States have been diagnosed with clinical osteoporosis (defined as bone mineral content greater
than 2.5 standard deviations below that of mature young adult bone). The frequency of
osteoporosis in the human population increases with age. Among Caucasians, osteoporosis is
predominant in women who, in the United States, comprise 80% of the osteoporosis patient pool.
The increased fragility and susceptibility to fracture of skeletal bone in the aged is aggravated by
the greater risk of accidental falls in this population. Fractured hips, wrists, and vertebrae are
among the most common injuries associated with osteoporosis. Hip fractures in particular are
extremely uncomfortable and expensive for the patient, and for women, correlate with high rates
of mortality and morbidity.
[00041           Although osteoporosis has been regarded as an increase in the risk of fracture due
to decreased bone mass, few of the presently available treatments for skeletal disorders can
increase the bone density of adults, and most of the presently available treatments work primarily
by inhibiting further bone resorption rather than stimulating new bone formation. Estrogen is
now being prescribed to retard bone loss. However, some controversy exists over whether
patients gain any long term benefit and whether estrogen has any effect on patients over 75 years
old. Calcitonin, osteocalcin with vitamin K, or high doses of dietary calcium, with or without
vitamin D, have also been suggested for postmenopausal women. High doses of calcium,
however, often have undesired gastrointestinal side effects, and serum and urinary calcium levels
must be continuously monitored (e.g., Khosla and Riggs, Mayo Clin. Proc. 70:978982, 1995).
[00051           Other current therapeutic approaches to osteoporosis include bisphosphonates
(e.g., FosamaxTM, ActonelTM, BonvivaTM, ZometaTM, olpadronate, neridronate, skelid,
bonefos), parathyroid hormone, calcilytics, , anabolic steroids, lanthanum and strontium salts,
and sodium fluoride. Such therapeutics, however, are often associated with undesirable side
effects (see Khosla and Riggs, supra).
[00061           Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is a member of the dickkopf family of proteins that have
been shown to be negative regulators of Wnt-signaling, which has a central role in bone
development and formation (see, e.g., Glinka et al., Nature 391:357-62 (1998); Fedi et al., J Biol
Chem 274(27):19465-72 (1999); Zorn, Curr Biol 11 :R592-95 (2001); and Krupnik et al., Gene
                                                    2

    WO 20121058393                                                          PCT/US20111/058025

238: 301-13 (1999)). DKK1 inhibits Wnt signaling through its interaction with the Wnt co
receptors LRP5 or LRP6 and the kremen proteins (see, for example, Bafico et al., Nature Cell
Biol 3:683 (2001); Mao et al., Nature 411(17):321 (2001); Mao et al., Nature 417:664 (2002);
and Semenov et al., Curr Biol 11:951-61 (2001). By binding LRP5 (LRP6) and kremen proteins,
DKK1 prevents LRP5 or LRP6 from associating with members of the Wnt pathway and thus
prevents Wnt-mediated signal transduction, which in turn results in the inhibition of bone
formation.
[0007]           The DKK1 receptor LRP5/6 is a key protein in regulating bone mass (see, for
example, Gong et al., Cell 107:513-23 (2001); Patel, N Eng J Med 346(20):1572 (2002)). An
autosomal recessive disorder characterized by low bone mass (osteoporosis-pseudoglioma
syndrome, or "OPPG") has been identified as being caused by loss-of-function mutations in
LRP5 (Gong et al., 2001). In addition, gain-of-function mutations in LRP5 have been shown to
result in autosomal dominant high bone mass in humans (Little et al., Am J Human Genetics.
70(1):11-19, 2002). The same mutations in LRP5 that result in high bone mass can interfere with
the ability of DKK1 to inhibit LRP5 signaling (see, for example, Boyden et al., N Eng J Med.
346(20):1513-1521, 2002). Thus, DKKI1 is appropriately characterized as being a negative
regulator of bone deposition.
[0008]           Sclerostin, the product of the SOST gene, is absent in sclerosteosis, a skeletal
disease illustrated by bone overgrowth and strong dense bones (Brunkow et al., Am. J. Hum.
Genet., 68:577 589, 2001; Balemans et al., Hum. Mol. Genet., 10:537 543, 2001). Inhibitors of
sclerostin have been shown to increase the rate of bone mineralization, and thus bone mineral
density (Padhi et al., J Bone Miner Res. 2010 Jun; epublished ahead of print). Likewise, DKK1
has been shown to be involved in the regulation of bone formation, particularly in bone fracture
repair, and its role in various other diseases that are associated with bone loss (e.g., cancer and
diabetes).
[0009]           Given the drawbacks of current therapies there is a need for improved therapeutics
in the area of bone loss, such as osteoporosis, and improved fracture repair among other bone
disorders.

[0010]           Provided herein are novel DKK 1 inhibitors that are effective in treating
conditions requiring increased bone building, for example, fracture repair or bone loss associated
with pathological conditions, such as multiple myeloma. In addition, provided herein are
combinations of agents that increase bone anabolism including combinations of DKK1 and
sclerostin inhibitors. These combinations can be used for treatment of, for example,
osteoporosis, accelerating healing of fractures, and any number of conditions requiring an
increase in the rate of bone building. The combination can be two separate inhibitors, for
example, an anti-sclerostin antibody and an anti-DKK1 antibody, or can be a single molecular
entity, for example, a bispecific molecule including a bispecific antibody.
[0011]          Also provided herein are a variety of antibodies that bind DKK1. The anti-DKKI
agents may also block or reduce binding between DKK1 and LRP5 and/or LRP6, thereby
stimulating at least one activity associated with Wnt signaling. The agents can be an antibody or
an immunologically functional fragment thereof and thus include antibodies with a naturally
occurring structure, as well as polypeptides that have an antigen binding domain (e.g., a domain
antibody). The antibodies and fragments can be used to treat a variety of different diseases
including preventing or treating conditions relating to loss of bone mass or to stimulate
production of new bone, as well as various non-bone related disorders. Nucleic acids molecules,
vectors, and host cells useful in the production of the antibodies and selective binding agents are
also provided.

with solid arrows and AspN sites with dotted line arrows. Trypsin sites are in solid arrows and
AspN sites in dotted arrows. The binding region for Ab 5.25.1 includes two discontinuous
portions, the first from amino acids 98 to 104 and a region from amino acids 107-121 and 127
140. The last three disulfide bonds form a major epitope region where all tryptic sites can be
protected by Ab 5.25.1. ARG 102 is also protected from trypsin digestion. Removal of amino
acids position 121-125 by CNBr treatment does not cause loss of binding. The region noted as
resistant to AspN digestion may not be accessed for antibody binding.

purification techniques are performed according to manufacturer's specifications, as commonly
accomplished in the art or as described herein. The terminology used in connection with, and the
laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and
medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly
used in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses,
pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.
[00351           The following terms utilized in this disclosure, unless otherwise indicated, will be
understood to have the following meanings:
[00361           "DKK1" as used herein includes, for example, rat, murine, cynomolgous and
human native forms of DKK1. Exemplary nucleotide sequences encoding human, murine, rat and
cynomolgous DKK1 proteins are shown, respectively, in SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5 and 7; the
corresponding amino acid sequences are shown, respectively, in SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 6, and 8.
The human DKK1 protein (SEQ ID NO: 2) has a leader sequence consisting of amino acids 1-31
of SEQ ID NO: 2. An exemplary rat DKKI protein sequence is listed in GenBank Accession
XP219804. The term also includes variants of such native sequences that are immunologically
cross-reactive with these native proteins. These proteins can inhibit the interaction between
LRP5 or LRP6 with Wnt. The term can also refer to a fragment of a native or variant form of
DKK1 that contains an epitope to which an antibody can specifically bind.
[00371           The term "polynucleotide" or "nucleic acid" means single-stranded or double
stranded polymers. The nucleotides comprising the polynucleotide can be ribonucleotides or
deoxyribonucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide. Said modifications include
base modifications such as bromouridine and inosine derivatives, ribose modifications such as
2',3'-dideoxyribose, and internucleotide linkage modifications such as phosphorothioate,
phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate,
phoshoraniladate and phosphoroamidate. The term includes both single and double stranded
forms.
[00381           The term "oligonucleotide" means a polynucleotide comprising 200 or fewer
nucleotides. In some embodiments, oligonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in length. In other
embodiments, oligonucleotides are 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 to 40 nucleotides in
length. Oligonucleotides may be single stranded or double stranded, e.g., for use in the
construction of a mutant gene.
[00391           An "isolated nucleic acid molecule" means a DNA or RNA of genomic, mRNA,
cDNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof which is not associated with all or a
                                                  11

A-1574-WO-PCT
portion of a polynucicotide in which the isolated polynucleotide is found in nature, or is linked to
a polynucleotide to which it is not linked in nature. For purposes of this disclosure, it should be
understood that "a nucleic acid molecule comprising" a particular nucleotide sequence does not
encompass intact chromosomes. Isolated nucleic acid molecules "comprising" specified nucleic
acid sequences may include, in addition to the specified sequences, coding sequences for up to
ten or even up to twenty other proteins or portions thereof, or may include operably linked
regulatory sequences that control expression of the coding region of the recited nucleic acid
sequences, and/or may include vector sequences.
[0040]          Unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of any single-stranded
polynucleotide sequence discussed herein is the 5' end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded
polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5' direction. The direction of 5' to 3' addition of
nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the
DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA transcript that are 5' to the 5' end of the RNA
transcript are referred to as "upstream sequences"; sequence regions on the DNA strand having
the same sequence as the RNA transcript that are 3' to the 3' end of the RNA transcript are
referred to as "downstream sequences".
[00411          The term "control sequence" refers to a polynucleotide sequence that can affect
the expression and processing of coding sequences to which it is ligated. The nature of such
control sequences may depend upon the host organism. In particular embodiments, control
sequences for prokaryotes may include a promoter, a ribosomal binding site, and a transcription
termination sequence. For example, control sequences for eukaryotes may include promoters
comprising one or a plurality of recognition sites for transcription factors, transcription enhancer
sequences, and transcription termination sequence. "Control sequences" according to the
invention can include leader sequences and/or fusion partner sequences.
[00421          The term "vector" means any molecule or entity (e.g., nucleic acid, plasmid,
bacteriophage or virus) used to transfer protein coding information into a host cell.
[0043]          The term "expression vector" or "expression construct" refers to a vector that is
suitable for transformation of a host cell and contains nucleic acid sequences that direct and/or
control (in conjunction with the host cell) expression of one or more heterologous coding regions
operatively linked thereto. An expression construct may include, but is not limited to, sequences
that affect or control transcription, translation, and, if introns are present, affect RNA splicing of
a coding region operably linked thereto.

A-1574-WO-PCT
[00441          As used herein, "operably linked" means that the components to which the term is
applied are in a relationship that allows them to carry out their inherent functions under suitable
conditions. For example, a control sequence in a vector that is "operably linked" to a protein
coding sequence is ligated thereto so that expression of the protein coding sequence is achieved
under conditions compatible with the transcriptional activity of the control sequences.
[00451          The term "host cell" means a cell that has been transformed, or is capable of being
transformed, with a nucleic acid sequence and thereby expresses a gene of interest. The term
includes the progeny of the parent cell, whether or not the progeny is identical in morphology or
in genetic make-up to the original parent cell, so long as the gene of interest is present.
[0046]          The term "transduction" means the transfer of genes from one bacterium to
another, usually by bacteriophage. "Transduction" also refers to the acquisition and transfer of
eukaryotic cellular sequences by retroviruses.
[00471          The term "transfection" means the uptake of foreign or exogenous DNA by a cell,
and a cell has been "transfected" when the exogenous DNA has been introduced inside the cell
membrane. A number of transfection techniques are well known in the art and are disclosed
herein. See, e.g., Graham et al., 1973, Virology 52:456; Sambrook et al., 2001, Molecular
Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Id.; Davis et al., 1986, Basic Methods in Molecular Biology,
Elsevier; and Chu et al., 1981, Gene 13:197. Such techniques can be used to introduce one or
more exogenous DNA moieties into suitable host cells.
[0048]          The term "transformation" refers to a change in a cell's genetic characteristics, and
a cell has been transformed when it has been modified to contain new DNA or RNA. For
example, a cell is transformed where it is genetically modified from its native state by
introducing new genetic material via transfection, transduction, or other techniques. Following
transfection or transduction, the transforming DNA may recombine with that of the cell by
physically integrating into a chromosome of the cell, or may be maintained transiently as an
episomal element without being replicated, or may replicate independently as a plasmid. A cell is
considered to have been "stably transformed" when the transforming DNA is replicated with the
division of the cell.
[0049]          The terms "polypeptide" or "protein" means a macromolecule having the amino
acid sequence of a native protein, that is, a protein produced by a naturally-occurring and non
recombinant cell, or produced by a genetically-engineered or recombinant cell, and comprise
molecules having the amino acid sequence of the native protein, or molecules having deletions
from, additions to, and/or substitutions of one or more amino acids of the native sequence. The

A-1574-WO-PCT
terms "polypeptide" and "protein" specifically encompass anti-DKK1 antibodies, or sequences
that have deletions from, additions to, and/or substitutions of one or more amino acid of anti
DKK1 antibody. The term "polypeptide fragment" refers to a polypeptide that has an amino
terminal deletion, a carboxyl-terminal deletion, and/or an internal deletion as compared with the
full-length native protein. Such fragments may also contain modified amino acids as compared
with the native protein. In certain embodiments, fragments are about 5 to 500 amino acids long.
For example, fragments may be at least 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 20, 50, 70, 100, 110, 150, 200, 250, 300,
350, 400, or 450 amino acids long. Useful polypeptide fragments for this invention include
immunologically functional fragments of antibodies, including binding domains. In the case of
anti-DKK1 antibody, useful fragments include but are not limited to a CDR region, a variable
domain of a heavy or light chain, a portion of an antibody chain or just its variable region
including two CDRs, and the like.
[00501           The term "isolated protein" referred to herein means that a subject protein (1) is
free of at least some other proteins with which it would normally be found, (2) is essentially free
of other proteins from the same source, e.g., from the same species, (3) is expressed by a cell
from a different species, (4) has been separated from at least about 50 percent of polynucleotides,
lipids, carbohydrates, or other materials with which it is associated in nature, (5) is operably
associated (by covalent or noncovalent interaction) with a polypeptide with which it is not
associated in nature, or (6) does not occur in nature. Genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA or other
RNA, of synthetic origin, or any combination thereof may encode such an isolated protein.
Preferably, the isolated protein is substantially free from proteins or polypeptides or other
contaminants that are found in its natural environment that would interfere with its therapeutic,
diagnostic, prophylactic, research or other use.
[00511           A "variant" of a polypeptide (e.g., an antibody) comprises an amino acid sequence
wherein one or more amino acid residues are inserted into, deleted from and/or substituted into
the amino acid sequence relative to another polypeptide sequence. Variants of the invention
include fusion proteins.
[00521           A "derivative" of a polypeptide is a polypeptide (e.g., an antibody) that has been
chemically modified in some manner distinct from insertion, deletion, or substitution variants,
e.g., via conjugation to another chemical moiety.
[00531           The term "antibody" refers to an intact immunoglobulin of any isotype, or a
fragment thereof that can compete with the intact antibody for specific binding to the target
antigen, and includes chimeric, humanized, fully human, and bispecific antibodies. An intact

antibody generally will comprise at least two full-length heavy chains and two full-length light
chains, but in some instances may include fewer chains such as antibodies naturally occurring in
camelids which may comprise only heavy chains. Antibodies according to the invention may be
derived solely from a single source, or may be "chimeric," that is, different portions of the
antibody may be derived from two different antibodies. For example, the CDR regions may be
derived from a rat or murine source, while the framework region of the V region are derived from
a different animal source, such as a human. The antibodies or binding fragments of the invention
may be produced in hybridomas, by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical
cleavage of intact antibodies. Unless otherwise indicated, the term "antibody" includes, in
addition to antibodies comprising two full-length heavy chains and two full-length light chains,
derivatives, variants, fragments, and muteins thereof, examples of which are described below.
[0054]          The term "light chain" includes a full-length light chain and fragments thereof
having sufficient variable region sequence to confer binding specificity. A full-length light chain
includes a variable region domain, VL, and a constant region domain, CL. The variable region
domain of the light chain is at the amino-terminus of the polypeptide. Light chains according to
the invention include kappa chains and lambda chains.
[00551          The term "heavy chain" includes a full-length heavy chain and fragments thereof
having sufficient variable region sequence to confer binding specificity. A full-length heavy
chain includes a variable region domain, VH, and three constant region domains, CH1, CH2, and
CH3. The VH domain is at the amino-terminus of the polypeptide, and the CH domains are at the
carboxyl-terminus, with the CH3 being closest to the --COOH end. Heavy chains according to
the invention may be of any isotype, including IgG (including IgGI, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4
subtypes), IgA (including IgA1 and IgA2 subtypes), IgM and IgE.
[00561          The term "immunologically functional fragment" (or simply "fragment") of an
immunoglobulin chain, as used herein, refers to a portion of an antibody light chain or heavy
chain that lacks at least some of the amino acids present in a full-length chain but which is
capable of binding specifically to an antigen. Such fragments are biologically active in that they
bind specifically to the target antigen and can compete with intact antibodies for specific binding
to a given epitope. In one aspect of the invention, such a fragment will retain at least one CDR
present in the full-length light or heavy chain, and in some embodiments will comprise a single
heavy chain and/or light chain or portion thereof. These biologically active fragments may be
produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or may be produced by enzymatic or chemical
cleavage of intact antibodies. Immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragments of the

invention include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, domain antibodies and single
chain antibodies, and may be derived from any mammalian source, including but not limited to
human, mouse, rat, camelid or rabbit. It is contemplated further that a functional portion of the
inventive antibodies, for example, one or more CDRs, could be covalently bound to a second
protein or to a small molecule to create a therapeutic agent directed to a particular target in the
body, possessing bifunctional therapeutic properties, or having a prolonged serum half-life.
[00571          A "Fab fragment" is comprised of one light chain and the CH 1 and variable
regions of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of a Fab molecule cannot form a disulfide bond
with another heavy chain molecule.
[0058]          An "Fe" region contains two heavy chain fragments comprising the CH2 and CH3
domains of an antibody and in some cases the lower hinge region. The two heavy chain
fragments are held together by two or more disulfide bonds (typically in the hinge region) and by
hydrophobic interactions of the CH3 domains.
[0059]          A "Fab' fragment" contains one light chain and a portion of one heavy chain that
contains the VH domain and the CH1 domain and also the region between the CH1 and CH2
domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between the two heavy chains of
two Fab' fragments to form a F(ab') 2 molecule.
[00601          A "F(ab')2 fragment" contains two light chains and two heavy chains containing a
portion of the constant region between the CHI and CH2 domains, such that an interchain
disulfide bond is formed between the two heavy chains. A F(ab')2 fragment thus is composed of
two Fab' fragments that are held together by a disulfide bond between the two heavy chains.
[00611          The "Fv region" comprises the variable regions from both the heavy and light
chains, but lacks the constant regions.
[00621          "Single-chain antibodies" are Fv molecules in which the heavy and light chain
variable regions have been connected by a flexible linker to form a single polypeptide chain,
which forms an antigen-binding region. Single chain antibodies are discussed in detail in
International Patent Application Publication No. WO 88/01649 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and
5,260,203.
[00631          A "domain antibody" is an immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragment
containing only the variable region of a heavy chain or the variable region of a light chain. In
some instances, two or more VH regions are covalently joined with a peptide linker to create a
bivalent domain antibody. The two VH regions of a bivalent domain antibody may target the
same or different antigens.

[00641          A "bivalent antibody" comprises two antigen binding sites. In some instances, the
two binding sites have the same antigen specificities. However, bivalent antibodies may be
bispecific (see below).
[00651          A "multispecific antibody" is one that targets more than one antigen or epitope.
[00661          A "bispecific," "dual-specific" or "bifunctional" antibody is a hybrid antibody
having two different antigen binding sites. Bispecific antibodies are a species of multispecific
antibody and may be produced by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, fusion of
hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai & Lachmann (1990), Clin. Exp.
Immunol. 79:315-321; Kostelny et al. (1992), J. Immunol. 148:1547-1553. The two binding sites
of a bispecific antibody will bind to two different epitopes, which may reside on the same or
different protein targets.
[0067]          The term "neutralizing antibody" refers to an antibody that binds to a ligand,
prevents binding of the ligand to its binding partner and interrupts the biological response that
otherwise would result from the ligand binding to its binding partner. In assessing the binding
and specificity of an antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof, an antibody or
fragment will substantially inhibit binding of a ligand to its binding partner when an excess of
antibody reduces the quantity of binding partner bound to the ligand by at least about 20%, 30%,
40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 99% or more (as measured in an in vitro
competitive binding assay). In the case of antibodies to DKK1, a neutralizing antibody will
diminish the ability of DKK I to bind LRP5 or LRP6, thereby inducing a measurable increase in
Wnt activity.
[0068]          The term "compete" when used in the context of antibodies that compete for the
same epitope means competition between antibodies is determined by an assay in which the
antibody or immunologically functional fragment under test prevents or inhibits specific binding
of a reference antibody to a common antigen (e.g., DKKI or a fragment thereof). Numerous
types of competitive binding assays can be used, for example: solid phase direct or indirect
radioimmunoassay (RIA), solid phase direct or indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA), sandwich
competition assay (see, e.g., Stahli et al. (1983) Methods in Enzymology 9:242-253); solid phase
direct biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Kirkland et al., (1986) J. Immunol. 137:3614-3619) solid
phase direct labeled assay, solid phase direct labeled sandwich assay (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane
(1988) Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press); solid phase direct label
RIA using 1-125 label (see, e.g., Morel et al. (1988) Molec. Immunol. 25:7-15); solid phase direct
biotin-avidin EIA (see, e.g., Cheung, et al. (1990) Virology 176:546-552); and direct labeled RIA

(Moldenhauer et al. (1990) Scand. J. Immunol. 32:77-82). Typically, such an assay involves the
use of purified antigen bound to a solid surface or cells bearing either of these, an unlabelled test
immunoglobulin and a labeled reference immunoglobulin. Competitive inhibition is measured by
determining the amount of label bound to the solid surface or cells in the presence of the test
immunoglobulin. Usually the test immunoglobulin is present in excess. Antibodies identified by
competition assay (competing antibodies) include antibodies binding to the same epitope as the
reference antibody and antibodies binding to an adjacent epitope sufficiently proximal to the
epitope bound by the reference antibody for steric hindrance to occur. Additional details
regarding methods for determining competitive binding are provided in the examples herein.
Usually, when a competing antibody is present in excess, it will inhibit specific binding of a
reference antibody to a common antigen by at least 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%N or
75%. In some instance, binding is inhibited by at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 97% or more by
a selective binding agent, such as an antibody, and additionally capable of being used in an
animal to produce antibodies capable of binding to that antigen. An antigen may possess one or
more epitopes that are capable of interacting with different antibodies.
[00691          The term "epitope" includes any determinant capable of specifically binding to an
immunoglobulin or to a T-cell receptor. An epitope is a region of an antigen that is bound by an
antibody that specifically targets that antigen, and when the antigen is a protein, includes specific
amino acids that directly contact the antibody. Most often, epitopes reside on proteins, but in
some instances may reside on other kinds of molecules, such as nucleic acids. Epitope
determinants may include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids,
sugar side chains, phosphoryl or sulfonyl groups, and may have specific three dimensional
structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics. Generally, antibodies specific for
a particular target antigen will preferentially recognize an epitope on the target antigen in a
complex mixture of proteins and/or macromolecules.
[00701          An antibody of the invention is said to "specifically bind" its target antigen when
the dissociation constant (Kd) is 1x10-7 M. The antibody specifically binds antigen with "high
affinity" when the Kd is 1x10-8 , higher affinity is M 5x10-9 M, and with "very high affinity"
when the Kd is 5x10 1 0 M. In one embodiment of the invention, the antibody has a Kd of 1x10-9
M and an off-rate of about 1x10-4 /sec. In one embodiment of the invention, the off-rate is <1x10
5. In other embodiments of the invention, the antibodies will bind to human DKK1 with a Kd of
between about 1x10-8 M and x 10-10 M, and in yet another embodiment it will bind with a Kd
2x10- 0 . One of skill in the art will recognize that specifically binding does not mean exclusive

binding, rather it allows for some degree of non-specific binding as is typical in biological
reactions between groups with affinity to one another.
[0071]           The term "identity" refers to a relationship between the sequences of two or more
polypeptide molecules or two or more nucleic acid molecules, as determined by aligning and
comparing the sequences. "Percent identity" means the percent of identical residues between the
amino acids or nucleotides in the compared molecules and is calculated based on the size of the
smallest of the molecules being compared. For these calculations, gaps in alignments (if any)
must be addressed by a particular mathematical model or computer program (i.e., an
"algorithm"). Methods that can be used to calculate the identity of the aligned nucleic acids or
polypeptides include those described in Computational Molecular Biology, (Lesk, A. M., ed.),
1988, New York: Oxford University Press; Biocomputing Informatics and Genome Projects,
(Smith, D. W., ed.), 1993, New York: Academic Press; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data,
Part I, (Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds.), 1994, New Jersey: Humana Press; von Heinje,
G., 1987, Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, New York: Academic Press; Sequence
Analysis Primer, (Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds.), 1991, New York: M. Stockton Press; and
Carillo et al., 1988, SIAM J. Applied Math. 48: 1073.
[00721           In calculating percent identity, the sequences being compared are aligned in a way
that gives the largest match between the sequences. The computer program used to determine
percent identity is the GCG program package, which includes GAP (Devereux et al., 1984, Nucl
Acid Res 12:387; Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisc.). The
computer algorithm GAP is used to align the two polypeptides or polynucleotides for which the
percent sequence identity is to be determined. The sequences are aligned for optimal matching of
their respective amino acid or nucleotide (the "matched span", as determined by the algorithm).
A gap opening penalty (which is calculated as 3.times. the average diagonal, wherein the
"average diagonal" is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the
"diagonal" is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the particular
comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty (which is usually 1/10 times the gap opening
penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such as PAM 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in
conjunction with the algorithm. In certain embodiments, a standard comparison matrix (see
Dayhoff et al., 1978, Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure 5:345-352 for the PAM 250
comparison matrix; Henikoff et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 10915-10919 for the
BLOSUM 62 comparison matrix) is also used by the algorithm.

[00731          Recommended parameters for determining percent identity for polypeptides or
nucleotide sequences using the GAP program are the following:

[0074]          Certain alignment schemes for aligning two amino acid sequences may result in
matching of only a short region of the two sequences, and this small aligned region may have
very high sequence identity even though there is no significant relationship between the two full
length sequences. Accordingly, the selected alignment method (GAP program) can be adjusted if
so desired to result in an alignment that spans at least 50 contiguous amino acids of the target
polypeptide.
[0075]          As used herein, "substantially pure" means that the described species of molecule
is the predominant species present, that is, on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other
individual species in the same mixture. In certain embodiments, a substantially pure molecule is a
composition wherein the object species comprises at least 50% (on a molar basis) of all
macromolecular species present. In other embodiments, a substantially pure composition will
comprise at least 80YO, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of all macromolecular species present in the
composition. In other embodiments, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity
wherein contaminating species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection
methods and thus the composition consists of a single detectable macromolecular species.
[0076]          The term "osteopenia" refers to a patient with bone loss of at least one standard
deviation compared with a standard patient considered to have normal bone mineral density
(BMD). For present purposes, the measurement is determined by Dual Energy X-ray
Absorptiometry (DEXA) and the patient's BMD is compared with an age and gender-matched
standard (Z score). In determining osteopenia, BMD measurements may be taken of one or more
bones.
[0077]          The term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to the amount of an anti-DKKI
antibody determined to produce a therapeutic response in a mammal. Such therapeutically
effective amounts are readily ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art.

occurring amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage. See Immunology--A

unnatural amino acids such as .alpha.-, .alpha.-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids,

[0079]          The present invention provides novel compositions comprising antibodies and
antigen-binding sites of immunoglobulins specific for DKKI1 (e.g., a polypeptide consisting of
amino acids 32 to 266 of SEQ ID NO: 2). Some of these antibodies and antibody fragments can
cross-react with DKK1 from several mammalian sources, including rat, mouse, cynomolgus
monkey and human DKK1. Some of the antibodies and fragments have higher affinity for
DKK1 from one species than another (e.g., some antibodies and fragments have higher affinity
for human DKK1 as compared to rat or murine DKKI; other antibodies have higher affinity for
rat or murine DKK1 as compared to human DKK1). The invention also provides novel
neutralizing antibodies, including chimeric, humanized and human antibodies, as well as
antibodies and immunologically functional fragments thereof that bind a conformational epitope
in human DKK1. Nucleic acids encoding the antibodies and fragments are also disclosed, as
well as methods for expressing the antibodies using these nucleic acids. In another aspect, the
invention relates to molecules (e.g., immunologically functional fragments and polypeptides) that
are capable of exhibiting immunological binding properties of antibody antigen-binding sites.
[0080]          The antibodies and immunologically functional fragments that are disclosed
herein have a variety of utilities. Some of the antibodies and fragments, for instance, are useful in
specific binding assays, affinity purification of DKK1 or its ligands and in screening assays to
identify other antagonists of DKK1 activity. Certain of the antibodies can be used to treat various
diseases that are associated with the activity of DKKl. Some antibodies and fragments can thus
be used in a variety of treatments related to bone such as increasing bone mineral density,
synthesis of new bone, treatment of systemic bone loss (e.g., bone erosions), bone repair, and
treatments for various forms of arthritis. Some antibodies can also be used to increase osteoclast

activity and induce bone resorption. Certain of the antibodies and fragments that are disclosed,
however, can be used to treat a variety of diverse diseases that are unrelated to bone diseases. As
described in greater detail below, examples of such diseases include those in which it is desirable
to promote stem cell renewal (e.g., diabetes and diseases of the muscle), inflammatory diseases
(e.g., Crohn's and inflammatory bowel disease), neurological diseases, ocular diseases, renal
diseases, and various skin disorders.
[00811          A variety of selective binding agents useful for regulating the activity of DKK1
are provided. These agents include, for instance, antibodies and immunologically functional
fragments thereof that contain an antigen binding domain (e.g., single chain antibodies, domain
antibodies, immunoadhesions, and polypeptides with an antigen binding region) and specifically
bind to a DKK1 polypeptide (e.g., a human, rat and/or murine DKK1 polypeptide). Some of the
agents, for example, are useful in inhibiting the binding of DKKI to LRP5 and/or LRP6, and can
thus be used to stimulate one or more activities associated with Wnt signaling.
[0082]          Some of the binding agents that are provided have the structure typically
associated with naturally occurring antibodies. The structural units of these antibodies typically
comprise one or more tetramers, each composed of two identical couplets of polypeptide chains,
though some species of mammals also produce antibodies having only a single heavy chain. In a
typical antibody, each pair or couplet includes one full-length "light" chain (in certain
embodiments, about 25 kDa) and one full-length "heavy" chain (in certain embodiments, about
50-70 kDa). Each individual immunoglobulin chain is composed of several "immunoglobulin
domains," each consisting of roughly 90 to 110 amino acids and expressing a characteristic
folding pattern. These domains are the basic units of which antibody polypeptides are composed.
The amino-terminal portion of each chain typically includes a variable domain that is responsible
for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion is more conserved evolutionarily than the
other end of the chain and is referred to as the "constant region" or "C region." Human light
chains generally are classified as kappa and lambda light chains, and each of these contains one
variable domain and one constant domain. Heavy chains are typically classified as mu, delta,
gamma, alpha, or epsilon chains, and these define the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA,
and IgE, respectively. IgG has several subtypes, including, but not limited to, IgGI, IgG2, IgG3,
and IgG4. IgM subtypes include IgM, and IgM2. IgA subtypes include IgA1 and IgA2. In
humans, the IgA and IgD isotypes contain four heavy chains and four light chains; the IgG and
IgE isotypes contain two heavy chains and two light chains; and the IgM isotype contains five
heavy chains and five light chains. The heavy chain C region typically comprises one or more
                                                  22

      WO 20121058393                                                          PCT/US20111/058025
  A-1574-WO-PCT
  domains that may be responsible for effector function. The number of heavy chain constant
  region domains will depend on the isotype. IgG heavy chains, for example, each contain three C
  region domains known as CHI, CH2 and CH3. The antibodies that are provided can have any of
  these isotypes and subtypes. In certain embodiments of the invention, the anti-DKKI antibody is
  of the IgGI, IgG2 or IgG4 subtype.
  [00831          In full-length light and heavy chains, the variable and constant regions are joined
  by a "J" region of about 12 or more amino acids, with the heavy chain also including a "D"
  region of about 10 more amino acids. See, e.g., Fundamental Immunology, 2nd ed., Ch. 7 (Paul,
  W., ed.) 1989, New York: Raven Press. The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair
  typically form the antigen binding site.
  [00841          Variable regions of immunoglobulin chains generally exhibit the same overall
  structure, comprising relatively conserved framework regions (FR) joined by three hypervariable
  regions, more often called "complementarity determining regions" or CDRs. The CDRs from the
  two chains of each heavy chain/light chain pair mentioned above typically are aligned by the
  framework regions to form a structure that binds specifically with a specific epitope on the target
  protein (e.g., DKK1). From N-terminal to C-terminal, naturally-occurring light and heavy chain
  variable regions both typically conform with the following order of these elements: FRI, CDR1,
  FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3 and FR4. A numbering system has been devised for assigning numbers
  to amino acids that occupy positions in each of these domains. This numbering system is defined
  in Kabat Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (1987 and 1991, National Institutes of
  Health, Bethesda, Md.), or Chothia & Lesk, 1987, J. Mol. Biol. 196: 901-917; Chothia et al.,

[00861           One of skill in the art will appreciate the distinction between sequences shown in
Table I that encompass variable regions of both the heavy and light chains compared to
sequences of the full length antibody, which additional comprise constant regions. Variable
domains can be combined with appropriate constant domains using standard technology well
known in the art. Each of the light chains listed in Table 1 can be combined with any of the
heavy chains shown in Table 1 (e.g., polypeptides depicted in SEQ ID NOs: 242 or 244) to form
an antibody. In some instances, the antibodies include at least one heavy chain and one light
chain from those listed in Table 1. In other instances, the antibodies contain two identical light
chains and two identical heavy chains. As an example, an antibody or immunologically
functional fragment may include two LI light chains and two HI heavy chains, or two L2 light
chains and two H3 heavy chains, or two L2 light chains and two H4 heavy chains or two L2 and
two H5 heavy chains and other similar combinations of pairs of light chains and pairs of heavy
chains as listed in Table 1.
[00871           Other antibodies that are provided are variants of antibodies formed by
combination of the heavy and light chains shown in Table 1 and comprise light and/or heavy
chains that each have at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97% or 99% identity to the
amino acid sequences of these chains. In some instances, such antibodies include at least one
heavy chain and one light chain, whereas in other instances such variant forms contain two
identical light chains and two identical heavy chains.
[00881           Certain antibodies comprise a light chain variable domain comprising a sequence
of amino acids that differs from the sequence of a light chain variable domain described herein at
only 1, 2,3,4,5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 amino acid residues, wherein each such
sequence difference is independently either a deletion, insertion or substitution of one amino
acid. The light chain variable region in some antibodies comprises a sequence of amino acids
that has at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97% or 99% sequence identity to the amino
acid sequences of the light chain variable regions in Table 1
[00891           Some antibodies that are provided comprise a heavy chain variable domain
comprising a sequence of amino acids that differs from the sequence of a heavy chain variable
domain in Table 1 at only 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 amino acid residues,
wherein each such sequence difference is independently either a deletion, insertion or
substitution of one amino acid. The heavy chain variable region in some antibodies comprises a
sequence of amino acids that has at least 70%, 75%, 8 0%,       85
                                                                   %, 9 0%, 95

sequence identity to the amino acid sequences of the heavy chain variable region shown in Table
1. Still other antibodies or immunologically functional fragments include variant forms of a
variant light chain and a variant heavy chain as just described.
[00901           Complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FR) of a
given antibody may be identified using the system described by Kabat et al. in Sequences of
Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed., US Dept. of Health and Human Services, PHS, NIH,
NIH Publication no. 91-3242, 1991.
[0091]           The antibodies and immunological functional fragments that are provided can
include one, two, three, four, five or all six of the CDRs listed above. Some antibodies or
fragments include both the light chain CDR3 and the heavy chain CDR3. Certain antibodies
have variant forms of the CDRs, with one or more (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6) of the CDRs each having
at least 80%, 85%, 90% or 95% sequence identity to a CDR sequence. For example, the
antibody or fragment can include both a light chain CDR3 and a heavy chain CDR3 that each
have at least 8 0%, 8 5 %, 90% or 95% sequence identity to the light chain CDR3 sequence and the
heavy chain CDR3, respectively. The CDR sequences of some of the antibodies that are
provided may also differ from the CDR sequences in Table 1 such that the amino acid sequence
for any given CDR differs from the sequence listed in Table 1 by no more than 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5
amino acid residues. Differences from the listed sequences usually are conservative substitutions
(see below).
[00921           Polypeptides comprising one or more of the light or heavy chain CDRs may be
produced by using a suitable vector to express the polypeptides in a suitable host cell as
described in greater detail below. The heavy and light chain variable regions and the CDRs that
are disclosed in Table 1 can be used to prepare any of the various types of immunologically
functional fragments that are known in the art including, but not limited to, domain antibodies,
Fab fragments, Fab' fragments, F(ab') 2 fragments, Fv fragments, single-chain antibodies and
scFvs.
[00931           When an antibody is said to bind an epitope within specified residues, such as
DKK1, for example, what is meant is that the antibody specifically binds to a polypeptide
consisting of the specified residues (e.g., a specified segment of DKK1). Such an antibody does
not necessarily contact every residue within DKK1. Nor does every single amino acid
substitution or deletion within DKK1 necessarily significantly affect binding affinity. Exact
epitope specificity of an antibody can be determined in variety of ways. One approach, for
example, involves testing a collection of overlapping peptides of about 15 amino acids spanning
                                                    40

the sequence of DKK1 and differing in increments of a small number of amino acids (e.g., 3
amino acids). The peptides are immobilized within the wells of a microtiter dish.
Immobilization can be effected by biotinylating one terminus of the peptides. Optionally,
different samples of the same peptide can be biotinylated at the N and C terminus and
immobilized in separate wells for purposes of comparison. This is useful for identifying end
specific antibodies. Optionally, additional peptides can be included terminating at a particular
amino acid of interest. This approach is useful for identifying end-specific antibodies to internal
fragments of DKK1. An antibody or immunologically functional fragment is screened for
specific binding to each of the various peptides. The epitope is defined as occurring with a
segment of amino acids that is common to all peptides to which the antibody shows specific
binding.
[0094]           Antibodies and functional fragments thereof that bind to a conformational epitope
that is located in the carboxy-terminal portion of DKKI (see Table 1) are also provided. The
carboxy-terminus of DKK1 contains several cysteine residues that form a cluster of disulfide
bonds which create several loops. The invention provides antibodies that bind to two of these
loops, thereby neutralizing the ability of DKKI to suppress Wnt activity. Exemplary antibodies
capable of binding to the aforementioned conformational epitope are the monoclonal antibodies
11H10 and IFI1, each of which comprises a light chain and a heavy chain. These antibodies are
described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 7,709,611.
[0095]           The epitope comprising these two loops is formed by disulfide bonds between
cysteine residues 220 and 237 of SEQ ID NO: 2 and between cysteine residues 245 and 263 of
SEQ ID NO:2. The body of the two loops that form the epitope thus includes amino acids 221
236 and 246-262 of SEQ ID NO: 2. Segments within this loop that are involved in binding
include amino acids 221-229 of SEQ ID NO:2 and amino acids 246-253 of SEQ ID NO: 2.
Thus, certain antibodies and fragments that are provided herein specifically bind to the foregoing
region(s). Some of the antibodies and fragments, for instance, bind to a peptide comprising or
consisting of amino acids 221 to 262 of SEQ ID NO: 2.
[00961           In one aspect of the invention, peptides comprising or consisting of amino acids
221-229 and/or 246-253 of SEQ ID NO: 2 are provided. Other peptides comprise or consist of
amino acids 221-236 and/or 246-262 of SEQ ID NO: 2. Still other peptides that are provided
comprise or consist of the region from 221 to 262 of SEQ ID NO: 2 or amino acids 221-253 of

peptides may be fused to another peptide to increase immunogenicity and thus be in the form of a
fusion protein.
[00971           Antibodies and immunologically functional fragments thereof that compete with
one the exemplified antibodies or functional fragments for specific binding to DKK1 are also
provided. Such antibodies and fragments may also bind to the same epitope as one of the
exemplified antibodies. Antibodies and fragments that compete with or bind to the same epitope
as the exemplified antibody or fragment are expected to show similar functional properties. The
exemplified antibodies and fragment include those described above, including those with the
heavy and light chains, variable region domains and CDRs listed in Table 1. Competing
antibodies or immunologically functional fragments can include those that bind to the epitope
described in the section on antibodies and epitopes above.
[00981           As a specific example, some competing antibodies or fragments include those that
specifically bind a DKK1 protein consisting of amino acids 32 to 266 of SEQ ID NO: 2 and can
prevent or reduce the binding to human DKK1 of an antibody that consists of two identical heavy
chains and two identical light chains. Other competing antibodies prevent or reduce the binding
to human DKK1 of an antibody that consists of two identical heavy chains and two identical light
chains such as those listed in Table 1.
[00991           The antibodies that are provided include monoclonal antibodies that bind to
DKKl. Monoclonal antibodies may be produced using any technique known in the art, e.g., by
immortalizing spleen cells harvested from the transgenic animal after completion of the
immunization schedule. The spleen cells can be immortalized using any technique known in the
art, e.g., by fusing them with myeloma cells to produce hybridomas. Myeloma cells for use in
hybridoma-producing fusion procedures preferably are non-antibody-producing, have high fusion
efficiency, and enzyme deficiencies that render them incapable of growing in certain selective
media which support the growth of only the desired fused cells (hybridomas). Examples of
suitable cell lines for use in mouse fusions include Sp-20, P3-X63/Ag8, P3-X63-Ag8.653,
NSI/1.Ag 4 1, Sp210-AgI4, FO, NSO/U, MPC- 11, MPCII-X45-GTG 1.7 and S194/5XXO Bul;
examples of cell lines used in rat fusions include R210.RCY3, Y3-Ag 1.2.3, IR983F and 4B210.
Other cell lines useful for cell fusions are U-266, GM1500-GRG2, LICR-LON-HMy2 and
UC729-6.
[00100]          In some instances, a hybridoma cell line is produced by immunizing an animal
(e.g., a transgenic animal having human immunoglobulin sequences) with a DKK1 immunogen;

harvesting spleen cells from the immunized animal; fusing the harvested spleen cells to a
myeloma cell line, thereby generating hybridoma cells; establishing hybridoma cell lines from
the hybridoma cells, and identifying a hybridoma cell line that produces an antibody that binds a
DKK1 polypeptide. Such hybridoma cell lines, and anti-DKK1 monoclonal antibodies produced
by them, are encompassed by the present invention.
[00101]         Monoclonal antibodies secreted by a hybridoma cell line can be purified using any
useful technique known in the antibody arts. Hybridomas or mAbs may be further screened to
identify mAbs with particular properties, such as the ability to block a Wnt induced activity.
Examples of such screens are provided in the examples below.
[00102]         Chimeric and humanized antibodies based upon the foregoing sequences are also
provided. Monoclonal antibodies for use as therapeutic agents may be modified in various ways
prior to use. One example is a "chimeric" antibody, which is an antibody composed of protein
segments from different antibodies that are covalently joined to produce functional
immunoglobulin light or heavy chains or immunologically functional portions thereof.
Generally, a portion of the heavy chain and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to a
corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a
particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is/are identical with or
homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from another species or belonging
to another antibody class or subclass. For methods relating to chimeric antibodies, see, for
example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., Proc. Nat]. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851-6855
(1985). CDR grafting is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,180,370, 5,693,762,
5,693,761, 5,585,089, and 5,530,101.
[00103]         Generally, the goal of making a chimeric antibody is to create a chimera in which
the number of amino acids from the intended patient species is maximized. One example is the
"CDR-grafted" antibody, in which the antibody comprises one or more complementarity
determining regions (CDRs) from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class
or subclass, while the remainder of the antibody chain(s) is/are identical with or homologous to a
corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another
antibody class or subclass. For use in humans, the V region or selected CDRs from a rodent
antibody often are grafted into a human antibody, replacing the naturally-occurring V regions or
CDRs of the human antibody.
[00104]         One useful type of chimeric antibody is a "humanized" antibody. Generally, a
humanized antibody is produced from a monoclonal antibody raised initially in a non-human

animal. Certain amino acid residues in this monoclonal antibody, typically from non-antigen
recognizing portions of the antibody, are modified to be homologous to corresponding residues in
a human antibody of corresponding isotype. Humanization can be performed, for example, using
various methods by substituting at least a portion of a rodent variable region for the
corresponding regions of a human antibody (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,585,089, and 5,693,762;
Jones et al., 1986, Nature 321:522-25; Riechmann et al., 1988, Nature 332:323-27; Verhoeyen et
al., 1988, Science 239:1534-36). In certain embodiments, constant regions from species other
than human can be used along with the human variable region(s) to produce hybrid antibodies.
[00105]         Fully human antibodies are also provided. Methods are available for making fully
human antibodies specific for a given antigen without exposing human beings to the antigen
("fully human antibodies"). One means for implementing the production of fully human
antibodies is the "humanization" of the mouse humoral immune system. Introduction of human
immunoglobulin (Ig) loci into mice in which the endogenous Ig genes have been inactivated is
one means of producing fully human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in mouse, an animal that
can be immunized with any desirable antigen. Using fully human antibodies can minimize the
immunogenic and allergic responses that can sometimes be caused by administering mouse or
mouse-derivatized Mabs to humans as therapeutic agents.
[00106]         Fully human antibodies can be produced by immunizing transgenic animals
(usually mice) that are capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of
endogenous immunoglobulin production. Antigens for this purpose typically have six or more
contiguous amino acids, and optionally are conjugated to a carrier, such as a hapten. See, for
example, Jakobovits et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:2551-2555; Jakobovits et al.,
1993, Nature 362:255-258; and Bruggermann et al., 1993, Year in Immunol. 7:33. In one
example of such a method, transgenic animals are produced by incapacitating the endogenous
mouse immunoglobulin loci encoding the mouse heavy and light immunoglobulin chains therein,
and inserting into the mouse genome large fragments of human genome DNA containing loci that
encode human heavy and light chain proteins. Partially modified animals, which have less than
the full complement of human immunoglobulin loci, are then cross-bred to obtain an animal
having all of the desired immune system modifications. When administered an immunogen,
these transgenic animals produce antibodies that are immunospecific for the immunogen but have
human rather than murine amino acid sequences, including the variable regions. For further
details of such methods, see, for example, W096/33735 and W094/02602. Additional methods
relating to transgenic mice for making human antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. Nos.

[00107]         The transgenic mice described above, referred to herein as "HuMab" mice, contain
a human immunoglobulin gene minilocus that encodes unrearranged human heavy (pi and
gamma) and kappa light chain immunoglobulin sequences, together with targeted mutations that
inactivate the endogenous p and .kappa. chain loci (Lonberg et al., 1994, Nature 368: 856-859).
[00108]         Accordingly, the aforementioned mice exhibit reduced expression of mouse IgM
or kappa and in response to immunization, and the introduced human heavy and light chain
transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate high affinity human IgG
kappa monoclonal antibodies (Lonberg et al., supra.; Lonberg and Huszar, 1995, Intern. Rev.
Immunol., 13: 65-93; Harding and Lonberg, 1995, Ann. N.Y Acad. Sci 764: 536-546). The

producing human antibodies in these transgenic mice are disclosed also in WO 98/24893, and
Mendez et al., 1997, Nature Genetics 15: 146-156. For example, the HCO7 and HCO12
transgenic mice strains can be used to generate human anti-DKK1 antibodies.
[00109]         Using hybridoma technology, antigen-specific human MAbs with the desired
specificity can be produced and selected from the transgenic mice such as those described above.
Such antibodies may be cloned and expressed using a suitable vector and host cell, or the
antibodies can be harvested from cultured hybridoma cells.
[00110]         Fully human antibodies can also be derived from phage-display libraries (as
disclosed in Hoogenboom et al., 1991, J. Mol. Biol. 227:38 1; and Marks et al., 1991, J. Mol.
Biol. 222:58 1). Phage display techniques mimic immune selection through the display of
antibody repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, and subsequent selection of
phage by their binding to an antigen of choice. One such technique is described in PCT

[00117]          Some antibodies or fragments include a light chain that comprises or consists of
the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, 50, 54, 58, 62,

sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84,
88, 92, or 96.
[00118]          Also included are isolated antibodies or an immunologically functional fragments
thereof that specifically bind a mature human DKKI protein expressed from the sequence
depicted in SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein said antibody binds to an epitope comprising two loops, said
loops being formed by disulfide bonds between amino acids 220 and 237 of SEQ ID NO: 2 and
between cysteine residues 245 and 263 of SEQ ID NO:2.
[00119]          Other antibodies or fragments that are disclosed compete with an antibody such as
those described above for specific binding to a DKK1 polypeptide. For example, some
antibodies and fragments compete with an antibody that consists of two identical heavy chains
and two identical light chains, wherein the heavy chains comprise SEQ ID NO: 42 and said light
chains comprise SEQ ID NO: 44.
[00120]          The various antibodies and fragments that are provided may include a single light
and/or heavy chain or a single variable light domain and/or a single variable heavy domain.
Other antibodies and fragments include two light and/or two heavy chains. In those instances in
which the antibody or fragment includes two light and/or heavy chains, the two light chains in
some instances are identical to one another; likewise, the two heavy chains in some instances are
identical. The antibodies that are provided may include, for example, monoclonal antibodies, a
human antibody, a chimeric antibody, or a humanized antibody. The immunologically functional
fragments may include, but are not limited to, a scFv, a Fab, a Fab', a F(ab') 2 , or a domain
antibody. In certain instances, the antibody or fragment dissociates from a DKK1 polypeptide
with a kd (koff) of 5x10-4 or less.
[00121]          Pharmaceutical compositions that include any of the foregoing antibodies and
immunologically active fragments are also provided. Such compositions typically also include a
buffer, a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, a carrier, a solubilizer, an emulsifier or a
preservative. The use of the foregoing antibodies and immunologically active fragments in the
preparation of a pharmaceutical composition or medicament is also provided.

[001221         A variety of nucleic acids encoding the foregoing antibodies are also provided.
Some nucleic acids, for instance, encode (a) a light chain CDR with the amino acid sequence as
set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, 81,
85, 89, and/or 93; and/or (b) a heavy chain CDR with the amino acid sequence as set forth in
SEQ ID NOs: 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43, 47, 51, 55, 59, 63, 67, 71, 75, 79, 83, 87, 91
and/or 95, such that the encoded CDR(s) encode an antibody or an immunologically functional
fragment thereof that can specifically bind a DKK1 polypeptide. Certain other nucleic acids
comprise or consist of a sequence that encodes a variable light region (VL) and/or a variable
heavy region (VH) of an antibody or immunologically active fragment, wherein the VL has at
least 80%, 90% or 95% sequence identity with SEQ ID NOs: 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45,
49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69, 73, 77, 81, 85, 89, or 93 and the VH has at least 80% 90%, or 95%
sequence identity with SEQ ID NOs: 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43, 47, 51, 55, 59, 63, 67, 71,
75, 79, 83, 87, 91 or 95. Some of the nucleic acids include a sequence that encodes a VL that
comprises or consists of SEQ ID NOs: 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57, 61, 65, 69,
73, 77, 81, 85, 89, or 93 and/or a sequence that encodes a VH that comprises or consists of SEQ
ID NOs: 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43, 47, 51, 55, 59, 63, 67, 71, 75, 79, 83, 87, 91 or 95.
Expression vectors comprising the foregoing nucleic acids are also disclosed herein, as are cells
(e.g., CHO cells) that comprise such expression vectors. Methods of producing an antibody or an
immunologically active fragment thereof by culturing cells that contain such expression vectors
are also described.
[00123]         Provided herein are novel DKKI1 antibodies that are effective in treating
conditions requiring increased bone building, for example, fracture repair or bone loss associated
with pathological conditions, such as multiple myeloma. In addition, provided herein are
combinations of agents that increase bone anabolism including combinations of DKK1 and
sclerostin inhibitors. These combinations can be used for treatment of, for example,
osteoporosis, increase the rate of fracture healing, and any number of conditions requiring an
increase in the rate of bone building. The combination therapeutic can take the form of two
separate inhibitors, for example, an anti-sclerostin antibody and an anti-DKK I antibody, or can
be a single molecular entity, for example, a bispecific antibody.
[00124]         As used herein, a bispecific antibody binds one antigen on one of its two binding
arms, and binds a different antigen on its second arm. Thus a bispecific antibody has two distinct
antigen binding arms and is monovalent for each antigen it binds. Bispecific and bifunctional
DKK1 antibodies provided herein can include one or more CDRs or one or more variable regions
                                                  49

as described above. A bispecific or bifunctional antibody in some instances is an artificial hybrid
antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. These
bispecific antibodies may be produced by a variety of methods including, but not limited to,
fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments. See, e.g., Songsivilai & Lachmann, 1990,
Clin. Exp. Immunol. 79: 315-321; Kostelny et al., 1992, J. Immunol. 148: 1547-1553.
[00125]          Bispecific molecules can also be created according to the invention by fusion. In
one example, an antibody of the invention can be linked (e.g., by expressing fused proteins,
chemical linking, high affinity non-covalent association or the like) to one or more other binding
molecules. Examples of such binding molecules include but are not limited to another antibody,
antibody fragment, peptide or binding mimetic, such that a bispecific molecule results.
[00126]          Bispecific molecules can also comprise a first binding specificity for sclerostin
and a second binding specificity for a second target. For example, the second target can be
another epitope of sclerostin different from the first epitope. Another example is a bispecific
molecule comprising at least one first binding specificity for sclerostin and a second binding
specificity for an epitope within DKK1. Another example is a bispecific molecule comprising at
least one first binding specificity for sclerostin and a second binding specificity for an epitope
within LRP4. Additionally, for the invention in which the bispecific molecule is multi-specific,
the molecule can further include a third binding specificity, in addition to the first and second
target epitope.
[00127]          In one embodiment, the bispecific molecules of the invention comprise as a
binding specificity at least one antibody, or an antibody fragment thereof, including, e.g., an Fab,
Fab', F(ab') 2, Fv, or a single chain Fv from a novel anti-DKKI antibody sequence provided
herein. It may also be a light chain or heavy chain dimer, or any minimal fragment such as a Fv
or a single chain construct as described in Ladner eta/. U.S. Patent No. 4,946,778.
[00128]          Bispecific molecules can be prepared by chemically conjugating the binding
portions using methods known in the art. When the binding portions are proteins or peptides, a
variety of coupling or cross-linking agents can be used for covalent conjugation. Examples
include protein A, carbodiimide, N-succinimidyl-S-acetyl-thioacetate (SATA), 5,5'-dithiobis(2
nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), o-phenylenedimaleimide (oPDM), N-succinimidyl-3-(2
pyridyl dithio)propionate (SPDP), and sulfosuccinimidyl4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohaxane
lcarboxylate (sulfo-SMCC) (see e.g., Karpovsky et a/., 1984 J. Exp. Med. 160:1686; Liu, MA et
al., 1985 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 82:8648). Other methods include those described in Paulus,
1985 Behring Ins. Mitt. No. 78,118-1 32; Brennan et al., 1985 Science 229:81-83, and Glennie et

A-1574-WO-PCT
al., 1987 J. Immunol. 139: 2367-2375.      Conjugating agents include SATA and sulfo-SMCC,
both available from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL). When the binding portions are
antibodies, they can be conjugated by sulfbydryl bonding of the hinge regions of the two heavy
chains. In one embodiment, the hinge region is modified to contain an odd number of sulfhydryl
residues such that there is a free sulfhydryl group that has not formed a disulfide linkage with a
corresponding heavy or light chain counterpart.
[00129]         Bispecific molecules may comprise at least two single chain molecules. Non
limiting examples of methods for preparing bispecific molecules are described various patent
publications including in U.S. Patent Number 5,260,203; U.S. Patent Number 5,455,030; U.S.
Patent Number 4,881,175; U.S. Patent Number 5,132,405; U.S. Patent Number 5,091,513; U.S.
Patent Number 5,476,786; U.S. Patent Number 5,013,653; U.S. Patent Number 5,258,498; U.S.
Patent Number 5,482,858; and U.S. Patent Application No. 2010/0076178.
[00130]         Examples of partners for either combination therapy with DKK1 inhibitors or bi
or multi-specific molecules including DKK1 binding portions include sclerostin antibodies or
binding fragments that specifically recognize sclerostin proteins. Sclerostin has been previously
described as being involved in regulating bone density through wnt signaling pathways (PCT
WO 06/119107).
[00131]         There is a report of a combination of a DKKI antibody and a sclerostin antibody
where it is suggested that this combination can increase the bone mineral density of cancellous or
spongy bone more than either alone in model animals (PCT WO 09/047356) and improved the
increase in total bone mineral content, density and cortical thickness . However, in those
examples intact bone was used, not fractured bone.
[00132]          Reports indicate that DKK1 expression is elevated in fracture models of non
unions (Bajada, et al., 2009 Bone; 45(4):726-35.). Likewise, healthy bone expresses lower levels
of DKK1 helping to explain the limited effect of DKKI antibodies alone on BMD in intact bone
(see Example 15). Thus, combinations of sclerostin and DKK1 inhibitors to treat fractures are
particularly useful given the surprisingly strong healing response including the significant
increase in the peak load in a relatively short period.
[00133]         Variants
[00134]         Some of the antibodies or immunologically functional fragments that are provided
are variant forms of the antibodies and fragments disclosed above (e.g., those having the
sequences listed in Table 1). For instance, some of the antibodies or fragments are ones having

one or more conservative amino acid substitutions in one or more of the heavy or light chains,
variable regions or CDRs listed in Table 1.
[00135]         Naturally-occurring amino acids may be divided into classes based on common
side chain properties: [0149] 1) hydrophobic: norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile; [0150] 2)
neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln; [0151] 3) acidic: Asp, Glu; [0152] 4) basic: His,
Lys, Arg; [0153] 5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and [0154] 6) aromatic:
Trp, Tyr, Phe. Conservative amino acid substitutions may involve exchange of a member of one
of these classes with another member of the same class. Conservative amino acid substitutions
may encompass non-naturally occurring amino acid residues, which are typically incorporated by
chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems. These include
peptidomimetics and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties.
[001361         Non-conservative substitutions may involve the exchange of a member of one of
the above classes for a member from another class. Such substituted residues may be introduced
into regions of the antibody that are homologous with human antibodies, or into the non
homologous regions of the molecule.
[001371          In making such changes, according to certain embodiments, the hydropathic index
of amino acids may be considered. The hydropathic profile of a protein is calculated by
assigning each amino acid a numerical value ("hydropathy index") and then repetitively
averaging these values along the peptide chain. Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic
index on the basis of its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics. They are: isoleucine (+4.5);
valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9);
alanine (+1.8); glycine (-0.4); threonine (-0.7); serine (-0.8); tryptophan (-0.9); tyrosine (-1.3);
proline (-1.6); histidine (-3.2); glutamate (-3.5); glutamine (-3.5); aspartate (-3.5); asparagine (
3.5); lysine (-3.9); and arginine (-4.5).
[001381          The importance of the hydropathic profile in conferring interactive biological
function on a protein is understood in the art (see, for example, Kyte et al., 1982, J. Mol. Biol.
157:105-131). It is known that certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acids
having a similar hydropathic index or score and still retain a similar biological activity. In
making changes based upon the hydropathic index, in certain embodiments, the substitution of
amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within .+-.2 is included. In some aspects of the
invention, those which are within .+-. 1 are included, and in other aspects of the invention, those
within .+-.0.5 are included.

[0013 91         It is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids can be
made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity, particularly where the biologically functional
protein or peptide thereby created is intended for use in immunological embodiments, as in the
present case. In certain embodiments, the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as
governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with its immunogenicity
and antigen-binding or immunogenicity, that is, with a biological property of the protein.
[00140]         The following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to these amino acid
residues: arginine (+3.0); lysine (+3.0); aspartate (+3.0.+-.1); glutamate (+3.0.+-.1); serine
(+0.3); asparagine (+0.2); glutamine (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (-0.4); proline (-0.5.+-.1);
alanine (-0.5); histidine (-0.5); cysteine (-1.0); methionine (-1.3); valine (-1.5); leucine (-1.8);
isoleucine (-1.8); tyrosine (-2.3); phenylalanine (-2.5) and tryptophan (-3.4). In making changes
based upon similar hydrophilicity values, in certain embodiments, the substitution of amino acids
whose hydrophilicity values are within .+/-.2 is included, in other embodiments, those which are
within .+/-.1 are included, and in still other embodiments, those within .+/-.0.5 are included. In
some instances, one may also identify epitopes from primary amino acid sequences on the basis
of hydrophilicity. These regions are also referred to as "epitopic core regions."
[00141]         A skilled artisan will be able to determine suitable variants of polypeptides as set
forth herein using well-known techniques. One skilled in the art may identify suitable areas of
the molecule that may be changed without destroying activity by targeting regions not believed to
be important for activity. The skilled artisan also will be able to identify residues and portions of
the molecules that are conserved among similar polypeptides. In further embodiments, even
areas that may be important for biological activity or for structure may be subject to conservative
amino acid substitutions without destroying the biological activity or without adversely affecting
the polypeptide structure.
[00142]         Additionally, one skilled in the art can review structure-function studies
identifying residues in similar polypeptides that are important for activity or structure. In view of
such a comparison, one can predict the importance of amino acid residues in a protein that
correspond to amino acid residues important for activity or structure in similar proteins. One
skilled in the art may opt for chemically similar amino acid substitutions for such predicted
important amino acid residues.
[001431         One skilled in the art can also analyze the three-dimensional structure and amino
acid sequence in relation to that structure in similar polypeptides. In view of such information,
one skilled in the art may predict the alignment of amino acid residues of an antibody with
                                                    53

respect to its three dimensional structure. One skilled in the art may choose not to make radical
changes to amino acid residues predicted to be on the surface of the protein, since such residues
may be involved in important interactions with other molecules. Moreover, one skilled in the art
may generate test variants containing a single amino acid substitution at each desired amino acid
residue. These variants can then be screened using assays for DKK1 neutralizing activity, (see
examples below) thus yielding information regarding which amino acids can be changed and
which must not be changed. In other words, based on information gathered from such routine
experiments, one skilled in the art can readily determine the amino acid positions where further
substitutions should be avoided either alone or in combination with other mutations.
[00144]          A number of scientific publications have been devoted to the prediction of
secondary structure. See Moult, 1996, Curr. Op. in Biotech. 7:422-427; Chou et al., 1974,
Biochemistry 13:222-245; Chou et al., 1974, Biochemistry 113:211-222; Chou et al., 1978, Adv.
Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 47:45-148; Chou et al., 1979, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 47:251-276;
and Chou et al., 1979, Biophys. J. 26:367-384. Moreover, computer programs are currently
available to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of predicting secondary
structure is based upon homology modeling. For example, two polypeptides or proteins that have
a sequence identity of greater than 30%, or similarity greater than 40% often have similar
structural topologies. The recent growth of the protein structural database (PDB) has provided
enhanced predictability of secondary structure, including the potential number of folds within a
polypeptide's or protein's structure. See Holm et al., 1999, Nucl. Acid. Res. 27:244-247. It has
been suggested (Brenner et al., 1997, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 7:369-376) that there are a limited
number of folds in a given polypeptide or protein and that once a critical number of structures
have been resolved, structural prediction will become dramatically more accurate.
[001451          Additional methods of predicting secondary structure include "threading" (Jones,
1997, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 7:377-87; Sippl et al., 1996, Structure 4:15-19), "profile analysis"
(Bowie et al., 1991, Science 253:164-170; Gribskov et al., 1990, Meth. Enzym. 183:146-159;
Gribskov et al., 1987, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 84:4355-4358), and "evolutionary linkage" (See
Holm, 1999, supra; and Brenner, 1997, supra).
[00146]          In some embodiments of the invention, amino acid substitutions are made that: (1)
reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding
affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter ligand or antigen binding affinities, and/or (4)
confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties on such polypeptides. For
example, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (in certain embodiments, conservative
                                                  54

    WO 20121058393                                                          PCT/US20111/058025

amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring sequence. Substitutions can be
made in that portion of the antibody that lies outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular
contacts). In such embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions can be used that do not
substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., one or more
replacement amino acids that do not disrupt the secondary structure that characterizes the parent
or native antibody). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures
are described in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed.), 1984, W. H. New
York: Freeman and Company; Introduction to Protein Structure (Branden and Tooze, eds.), 1991,
New York: Garland Publishing; and Thornton et at., 1991, Nature 354: 105, which are each
incorporated herein by reference.
[001471         The invention also encompasses glycosylation variants of the inventive antibodies
wherein the number and/or type of glycosylation site(s) has been altered compared to the amino
acid sequences of the parent polypeptide. In certain embodiments, antibody protein variants
comprise a greater or a lesser number of N-linked glycosylation sites than the native antibody.
An N-linked glycosylation site is characterized by the sequence: Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr,
wherein the amino acid residue designated as X may be any amino acid residue except proline.
The substitution of amino acid residues to create this sequence provides a potential new site for
the addition of an N-linked carbohydrate chain. Alternatively, substitutions that eliminate or
alter this sequence will prevent addition of an N-linked carbohydrate chain present in the native
polypeptide. For example, the glycosylation can be reduced by the deletion of an Asn or by
substituting the Asn with a different amino acid. In other embodiments, one or more new N
linked sites are created. Antibodies typically have a N-linked glycosylation site in the Fe region.
[001481         Additional preferred antibody variants include cysteine variants wherein one or
more cysteine residues in the parent or native amino acid sequence are deleted from or
substituted with another amino acid (e.g., seinee. Cysteine variants are useful, inter alia when
antibodies must be refolded into a biologically active conformation. Cysteine variants may have
fewer cysteine residues than the native antibody, and typically have an even number to minimize
interactions resulting from unpaired cysteines.
[00149]         The heavy and light chains, variable regions domains and CDRs that are disclosed
can be used to prepare polypeptides that contain an antigen binding region that can specifically
bind to a DKK1 polypeptide. For example, one or more of the CDRs listed in Table 1 can be
incorporated into a molecule (e.g., a polypeptide) covalently or noncovalently to make an
immunoadhesion. An immunoadhesion may incorporate the CDR(s) as part of a larger

polypeptide chain, may covalently link the CDR(s) to another polypeptide chain, or may
incorporate the CDR(s) noncovalently. The CDR(s) enable the immunoadhesion to bind
specifically to a particular antigen of interest (e.g., a DKKI polypeptide or epitope thereof).
[00150]          Mimetics (e.g., peptide mimetics" or "peptidomimetics") based upon the variable
region domains and CDRs that are described herein are also provided. These analogs can be
peptides, non-peptides or combinations of peptide and non-peptide regions. Fauchere, 1986, Adv.
Drug Res. 15: 29; Veber and Freidinger, 1985, TINS p. 392; and Evans et al., 1987, J. Med.
Chem. 30: 1229, which are incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Peptide mimetics
that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce a similar
therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Such compounds are often developed with the aid of
computerized molecular modeling. Generally, peptidomimetics of the invention are proteins that
are structurally similar to an antibody displaying a desired biological activity, such as here the
ability to specifically bind DKK1, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a
linkage selected from: --CH2NH--, --CH2S--, --CH2--CH.2--, --CH--CH-(cis and trans), -
COCH2--, --CH(OH)CH2--, and -CH2SO--, by methods well known in the art. Systematic
substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the
same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may be used in certain embodiments of the
invention to generate more stable proteins. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a
consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated
by methods known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch, 1992, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 61: 387),
incorporated herein by reference), for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of
forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.
[00151]          Derivatives of the antibodies and immunologically functional fragments that are
described herein are also provided. The derivatized antibody or fragment may comprise any
molecule or substance that imparts a desired property to the antibody or fragment, such as
increased half-life in a particular use. The derivatized antibody can comprise, for example, a
detectable (or labeling) moiety (e.g., a radioactive, colorimetric, antigenic or enzymatic
molecule, a detectable bead (such as a magnetic or electrodense (e.g., gold) bead), or a molecule
that binds to another molecule (e.g., biotin or streptavidin)), a therapeutic or diagnostic moiety
(e.g., a radioactive, cytotoxic, or pharmaceutically active moiety), or a molecule that increases
the suitability of the antibody for a particular use (e.g., administration to a subject, such as a
human subject, or other in vivo or in vitro uses). Examples of molecules that can be used to
derivatize an antibody include albumin (e.g., human serum albumin) and polyethylene glycol

(PEG). Albumin-linked and PEGylated derivatives of antibodies can be prepared using
techniques well known in the art. In one embodiment, the antibody is conjugated or otherwise
linked to transthyretin (TTR) or a TTR variant. The TTR or TTR variant can be chemically
modified with, for example, a chemical selected from the group consisting of dextran, poly(n
vinyl pyrrolidone), polyethylene glycols, propropylene glycol homopolymers, polypropylene
oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols and polyvinyl alcohols.
[00152]          Other derivatives include covalent or aggregative conjugates of anti-DKK1
antibodies, or fragments thereof, with other proteins or polypeptides, such as by expression of
recombinant fusion proteins comprising heterologous polypeptides fused to the N-terminus or C
terminus of an anti-DKK1 antibody polypeptide. For example, the conjugated peptide may be a
heterologous signal (or leader) polypeptide, e.g., the yeast alpha-factor leader, or a peptide such
as an epitope tag. Anti-DKKI antibody-containing fusion proteins can comprise peptides added
to facilitate purification or identification of the anti-DKK1 antibody (e.g., poly-His). An anti
DKK1 antibody polypeptide also can be linked to the FLAG peptide as described in Hopp et al.,
Bio/Technology 6:1204, 1988, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,912. The FLAG peptide is highly
antigenic and provides an epitope reversibly bound by a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb),
enabling rapid assay and facile purification of expressed recombinant protein. Reagents useful
for preparing fusion proteins in which the FLAG peptide is fused to a given polypeptide are
commercially available (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.).
[00153]          Oligomers that contain one or more anti-DKK1 antibody polypeptides may be
employed as DKKI antagonists. Oligomers may be in the form of covalently-linked or non
covalently-linked dimers, trimers, or higher. Oligomers comprising two or more anti-DKK1
antibody polypeptides are contemplated for use, with one example being a homodimer. Other
oligomers include heterodimers, homotrimers, heterotrimers, homotetramers, heterotetramers,
etc.
[00154]          One embodiment is directed to oligomers comprising multiple anti-DKK1
antibody polypeptides joined via covalent or non-covalent interactions between peptide moieties
fused to the anti-DKK1 antibody polypeptides. Such peptides may be peptide linkers (spacers),
or peptides that have the property of promoting oligomerization. Leucine zippers and certain
polypeptides derived from antibodies are among the peptides that can promote oligomerization of
anti-DKK1 antibody polypeptides attached thereto, as described in more detail below.
[00155]          In particular embodiments, the oligomers comprise from two to four anti-DKK1
antibody polypeptides. The anti-DKKI1 antibody moieties of the oligomer may be in any of the
                                                    57

A-1574-WO-PCT
forms described above, e.g., variants or fragments. Preferably, the oligomers comprise anti
DKK1 antibody polypeptides that have DKK1 binding activity.
[00156]          In one embodiment, an oligomer is prepared using polypeptides derived from
immunoglobulins. Preparation of fusion proteins comprising certain heterologous polypeptides
fused to various portions of antibody-derived polypeptides (including the Fc domain) has been
described, e.g., by Ashkenazi et al., 1991, PNAS USA 88:10535; Byrn et al., 1990, Nature
344:677; and Hollenbaugh et al., 1992 "Construction of Immunoglobulin Fusion Proteins", in
Current Protocols in Immunology, Suppl. 4, pages 10.19.1-10.19.11.
[001571          One embodiment of the present invention is directed to a dimer comprising two
fusion proteins created by fusing a DKK1 binding fragment of an anti-DKK1 antibody to the Fe
region of an antibody. The dimer can be made by, for example, inserting a gene fusion encoding
the fusion protein into an appropriate expression vector, expressing the gene fusion in host cells
transformed with the recombinant expression vector, and allowing the expressed fusion protein to
assemble much like antibody molecules, whereupon interchain disulfide bonds form between the
Fe moieties to yield the dimer.
[00158]          The term "Fe polypeptide" as used herein includes native and mutein forms of
polypeptides derived from the Fe region of an antibody. Truncated forms of such polypeptides
containing the hinge region that promotes dimerization also are included. Fusion proteins
comprising Fc moieties (and oligomers formed therefrom) offer the advantage of facile
purification by affinity chromatography over Protein A or Protein G columns.
[00159]          One suitable Fe polypeptide, described in PCT application WO 93/10151 and U.S.
Pat. Nos. 5,426,048 and 5,262,522 (each of which is hereby incorporated by reference), is a
single chain polypeptide extending from the N-terminal hinge region to the native C-terminus of
the Fe region of a human IgG 1 antibody. Another useful Fe polypeptide is the Fe mutein
described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,457,035 and in Baum et al., 1994, EMBO J. 13:3992-4001. The
amino acid sequence of this mutein is identical to that of the native Fe sequence presented in WO
93/10151, except that amino acid 19 has been changed from Leu to Ala, amino acid 20 has been
changed from Leu to Glu, and amino acid 22 has been changed from Gly to Ala. The mutein
exhibits reduced affinity for Fc receptors.
[00160]          In other embodiments, the variable portion of the heavy and/or light chains of an
anti-DKK1 antibody such as disclosed herein may be substituted for the variable portion of an
antibody heavy and/or light chain.

    WO 20121058393                                                           PCT/US20111/058025

[001611          Alternatively, the oligomer is a fusion protein comprising multiple anti-DKK1
antibody polypeptides, with or without peptide linkers (spacer peptides). Among the suitable
peptide linkers are those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,751,180 and 4,935,233.
[00162]          Another method for preparing oligomeric anti-DKKI antibody derivatives
involves use of a leucine zipper. Leucine zipper domains are peptides that promote
oligomerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally
identified in several DNA-binding proteins (Landschulz et al., 1988, Science 240:1759), and
have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are
naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of
leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble oligomeric proteins are described in PCT
application WO 94/10308, and the leucine zipper derived from lung surfactant protein D (SPD)
described in Hoppe et al., 1994, FEBS Letters 344:191, hereby incorporated by reference. The
use of a modified leucine zipper that allows for stable trimerization of a heterologous protein
fused thereto is described in Fanslow et al., 1994, Semin. Immunol. 6:267-78. In one approach,
recombinant fusion proteins comprising an anti-DKK1 antibody fragment or derivative fused to a
leucine zipper peptide are expressed in suitable host cells, and the soluble oligomeric anti-DKKI
antibody fragments or derivatives that form are recovered from the culture supernatant.
[00163]          Some antibodies that are provided have a binding affinity (Ka) for DKKI of at
least 104 or 105/M    x seconds measured, for instance, as described in the examples below. Other
antibodies have a ka of at least 106, 107, 108 or 109/M x seconds. Certain antibodies that are
provided have a low disassociation rate. Some antibodies, for instance, have a Koff of 1x10 4 s- 1,
1x10-5s- 1 or lower.
[00164]          In another aspect, the present invention provides an anti-DKKJ antibody having a
half-life of at least one day in vitro or in vivo (e.g., when administered to a human subject). In
one embodiment, the antibody has a half-life of at least three days. In another embodiment, the
antibody or portion thereof has a half-life of four days or longer. In another embodiment, the
antibody or portion thereof has a half-life of eight days or longer. In another embodiment, the
antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof is derivatized or modified such that it has a longer
half-life as compared to the underivatized or unmodified antibody. In another embodiment, the
antibody contains point mutations to increase serum half life, such as described in WO 00/09560.
[00165]          Nucleic acids that encode one or both chains of an antibody of the invention, or a
fragment, derivative, mutein, or variant thereof, polynucleotides sufficient for use as
hybridization probes, PCR primers or sequencing primers for identifying, analyzing, mutating or

amplifying a polynuclcotide encoding a polypeptide, anti-sense nucleic acids for inhibiting
expression of a polynucleotide, and complementary sequences of the foregoing are also provided.
The nucleic acids can be any length. They can be, for example, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45,
50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,500, 3,000, 5,000 or
more nucleotides in length, and/or can comprise one or more additional sequences, for example,
regulatory sequences, and/or be part of a larger nucleic acid, for example, a vector. The nucleic
acids can be single-stranded or double-stranded and can comprise RNA and/or DNA nucleotides,
and artificial variants thereof (e.g., peptide nucleic acids).
[00166]         Nucleic acids that encode the epitope to which certain of the antibodies provided
herein bind are also provided. Thus, some nucleic acids encode amino acids 221-229 and/or 246
253 of SEQ ID NO:2 are included, as are nucleic acids that encode amino acids 221-236 and/or
246-262 of SEQ ID NO:2 and those that encode amino acids 221 to 262 of SEQ ID NO:2 or
amino acids 221-253 of SEQ ID NO:2. Nucleic acids encoding fusion proteins that include these
peptides are also provided.
[00167]          DNA encoding antibody polypeptides (e.g., heavy or light chain, variable domain
only, or full length) may be isolated from B-cells of mice that have been immunized with DKK1
or an immunogenic fragment thereof. The DNA may be isolated by conventional procedures
such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Phage display is another example of a known
technique whereby derivatives of antibodies may be prepared. In one approach, polypeptides
that are components of an antibody of interest are expressed in any suitable recombinant
expression system, and the expressed polypeptides are allowed to assemble to fonn antibody
molecules.
[00168]          Exemplary nucleic acids that encode the light and heavy chains, variable regions
and CDRs of the antibodies and immunologically functional fragments that are provided are
listed in Table 1 above. Due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, each of the polypeptide
sequences listed in Table 1 is also encoded by a large number of other nucleic acid sequences
besides those listed in Table 1. The present invention provides each degenerate nucleotide
sequence encoding each antibody of the invention.
[00169]          The invention further provides nucleic acids that hybridize to other nucleic acids
(e.g., nucleic acids comprising a nucleotide sequence listed in Tables 1-3) under particular
hybridization conditions. Methods for hybridizing nucleic acids are well-known in the art. See,
e.g., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6. As
defined herein, a moderately stringent hybridization condition uses a prewashing solution

containing 5.times. sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0),
hybridization buffer of about 50% formamide, 6.times.SSC, and a hybridization temperature of
550 C. (or other similar hybridization solutions, such as one containing about 50% formamide,
with a hybridization temperature of 42.degree. C.), and washing conditions of 60' C, in 0.5x
SSC, 0.l1% SDS. A stringent hybridization condition hybridizes in 6x SSC at 450 C, followed by
one or more washes in 0.lx SSC, 0.2% SDS at 68' C. Furthermore, one of skill in the art can
manipulate the hybridization and/or washing conditions to increase or decrease the stringency of
hybridization such that nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences that are at least 65, 70, 75,
80, 85, 90, 95, 98 or 99% identical to each other typically remain hybridized to each other.
[001701         The basic parameters affecting the choice of hybridization conditions and
guidance for devising suitable conditions are set forth by, for example, Sambrook, Fritsch, and
Maniatis (1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., chapters 9 and 11; and Current Protocols in Molecular Biology,
1995, Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., sections 2.10 and 6.3-6.4), and can be readily
determined by those having ordinary skill in the art based on, for example, the length and/or base
composition of the DNA.
[001711         Changes can be introduced by mutation into a nucleic acid, thereby leading to
changes in the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide (e.g., an antibody or antibody derivative of
the invention) that it encodes. Mutations can be introduced using any technique known in the art.
In one embodiment, one or more particular amino acid residues are changed using, for example, a
site-directed mutagenesis protocol. In another embodiment, one or more randomly selected
residue is changed using, for example, a random mutagenesis protocol. However it is made, a
mutant polypeptide can be expressed and screened for a desired property.
[001721         Mutations can be introduced into a nucleic acid without significantly altering the
biological activity of a polypeptide that it encodes. For example, one can make nucleotide
substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at non-essential amino acid residues.
Alternatively, one or more mutations can be introduced into a nucleic acid that selectively change
the biological activity of a polypeptide that it encodes. For example, the mutation can
quantitatively or qualitatively change the biological activity. Examples of quantitative changes
include increasing, reducing or eliminating the activity. Examples of qualitative changes include
changing the antigen specificity of an antibody.
[00173]         In another aspect, the present invention provides nucleic acid molecules that are
suitable for use as primers or hybridization probes for the detection of nucleic acid sequences of

the invention. A nucleic acid molecule of the invention can comprise only a portion of a nucleic
acid sequence encoding a full-length polypeptide of the invention, for example, a fragment that
can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment encoding an active portion (e.g., a DKKI binding
portion) of a polypeptide of the invention.
[00174]          Probes based on the sequence of a nucleic acid of the invention can be used to
detect the nucleic acid or similar nucleic acids, for example, transcripts encoding a polypeptide of
the invention. The probe can comprise a label group, e.g., a radioisotope, a fluorescent
compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. Such probes can be used to identify a cell that
expresses
[001751          In another aspect, the present invention provides vectors comprising a nucleic acid
encoding a polypeptide of the invention or a portion thereof (e.g., a fragment containing one or
more CDRs or one or more variable region domains). Examples of vectors include, but are not
limited to, plasmids, viral vectors, non-episomal mammalian vectors and expression vectors, for
example, recombinant expression vectors. The recombinant expression vectors of the invention
can comprise a nucleic acid of the invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid
in a host cell. The recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory sequences,
selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, which is operably linked to the
nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Regulatory sequences include those that direct
constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in many types of host cells (e.g., SV40 early
gene enhancer, Rous sarcoma virus promoter and cytomegalovirus promoter), those that direct
expression of the nucleotide sequence only in certain host cells (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory
sequences, see Voss et al., 1986, Trends Biochem. Sci. 11:287, Maniatis et al., 1987, Science
236:1237, incorporated by reference herein in their entireties), and those that direct inducible
expression of a nucleotide sequence in response to particular treatment or condition (e.g., the
metallothionin promoter in mammalian cells and the tet-responsive and/or streptomycin
responsive promoter in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems (see id.). It will be appreciated
by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as
the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired, etc. The
expression vectors of the invention can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce proteins
or peptides, including fusion proteins or peptides, encoded by nucleic acids as described herein.
[00176]          In another aspect, the present invention provides host cells into which a
recombinant expression vector of the invention has been introduced. A host cell can be any
prokaryotic cell (for example, E. coli) or eukaryotic cell (for example, yeast, insect, or

mammalian cells (e.g., CHO cells)). Vector DNA can be introduced into prokaryotic or
eukaryotic cells via conventional transformation or transfection techniques. For stable
transfection of mammalian cells, it is known that, depending upon the expression vector and
transfection technique used, only a small fraction of cells may integrate the foreign DNA into
their genome. In order to identify and select these integrants, a gene that encodes a selectable
marker (e.g., for resistance to antibiotics) is generally introduced into the host cells along with
the gene of interest. Preferred selectable markers include those which confer resistance to drugs,
such as G418, hygromycin and methotrexate. Cells stably transfected with the introduced nucleic
acid can be identified by drug selection (e.g., cells that have incorporated the selectable marker
gene will survive, while the other cells die), among other methods.
[001771         The non-human antibodies that are provided can be, for example, derived from
any antibody-producing animal, such as mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, donkey, or non-human primate
(such as monkey (e.g., cynomologous or rhesus monkey) or ape (e.g., chimpanzee)). Non-human
antibodies can be used, for instance, in in vitro cell culture and cell-culture based applications, or
any other application where an immune response to the antibody does not occur or is
insignificant, can be prevented, is not a concern, or is desired. In certain embodiments of the
invention, the antibodies may be produced by immunizing with full-length DKKI or with the
carboxy-terminal half of DKK1. Alternatively, the certain non-human antibodies may be raised
by immunizing with amino acids 221-236 and/or amino acids 246-262 of SEQ ID NO:2, which
are segments of human DKKI that form part of the epitope to which certain antibodies provided
herein bind (e.g., the 1 1H1O, see FIG. 1). The antibodies may be polyclonal, monoclonal, or may
be synthesized in host cells by expressing recombinant DNA.
[001781         Fully human antibodies may be prepared as described above by immunizing
transgenic animals containing human immunoglobulin loci or by selecting a phage display library
that is expressing a repertoire of human antibodies.
[001791         The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of the invention can be produced by a variety
of techniques, including conventional monoclonal antibody methodology, e.g., the standard
somatic cell hybridization technique of Kohler and Milstein, 1975, Nature 256: 495.
Alternatively, other techniques for producing monoclonal antibodies can be employed, for
example, the viral or oncogenic transformation of B-lymphocytes. One suitable animal system
for preparing hybridomas is the murine system, which is a very well established procedure.
Immunization protocols and techniques for isolation of immunized splenocytes for fusion are
known in the art. For such procedures, B cells from immunized mice are fused with a suitable

immortalized fusion partner, such as a murine myeloma cell line. If desired, rats or other
mammals besides can be immunized instead of mice and B cells from such animals can be fused

a source other than mouse may be used. Fusion procedures for making hybridomas also are well
known.
[00180]         The single chain antibodies that are provided may be formed by linking heavy and
light chain variable domain (Fv region) fragments (see, e.g., Table 1) via an amino acid bridge
(short peptide linker), resulting in a single polypeptide chain. Such single-chain Fvs (scFvs) may
be prepared by fusing DNA encoding a peptide linker between DNAs encoding the two variable
domain polypeptides (VL and VH). The resulting polypeptides can fold back on themselves to
form antigen-binding monomers, or they can form multimers (e.g., dimers, trimers, or tetramers),
depending on the length of a flexible linker between the two variable domains (Kortt et al., 1997,
Prot. Eng. 10:423; Kortt et al., 2001, Biomol. Eng. 18:95-108). By combining different VL and
VH-comprising polypeptides, one can form multimeric scFvs that bind to different epitopes
(Kriangkum et al., 2001, Biomol. Eng. 18:31-40). Techniques developed for the production of
single chain antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird, 1988, Science
242:423; Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879; Ward et al., 1989, Nature
334:544, de Graaf et al., 2002, Methods Mol Biol. 178:379-87.
[00181]         Antibodies provided herein that are of one subclass can be changed to antibodies
from a different subclass using subclass switching methods. For example, the variable domains
depicted in Table 1 can be attached to constant domains of any desired Ig subtype. Such
techniques allow the preparation of new antibodies that possess the antigen-binding properties of
a given antibody (the parent antibody), but also exhibit biological properties associated with an
antibody isotype or subclass different from that of the parent antibody. Recombinant DNA
techniques may be employed. Cloned DNA encoding particular antibody polypeptides may be
employed in such procedures, e.g., DNA encoding the constant domain of an antibody of the
desired isotype. See, e.g., Lantto et al., 2002, Methods Mol. Biol.178:303-16.
[00182]         Accordingly, the antibodies that are provided include a desired isotype (for
example, IgA, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgE, and IgD) as well as Fab or F(ab') 2 fragments
thereof. Moreover, if an IgG4 is desired, it may also be desired to introduce a point mutation in
the hinge region as described in Bloom et al., 1997, Protein Science 6:407) to alleviate a
tendency to form intra-H chain disulfide bonds that can lead to heterogeneity in the IgG4
antibodies.

[001831          Moreover, techniques for deriving antibodies having different properties (i.e.,
varying affinities for the antigen to which they bind) are also known. One such technique,
referred to as chain shuffling, involves displaying immunoglobulin variable domain gene
repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, often referred to as phage display. Chain
shuffling has been used to prepare high affinity antibodies to the hapten 2-phenyloxazol-5-one, as
described by Marks et al., 1992, BioTechnology, 10:779.
[00184]          Conservative modifications may be made to the heavy and light chains described
in Table 1 (and corresponding modifications to the encoding nucleic acids) to produce an anti
DKKI antibody having functional and biochemical characteristics. Methods for achieving such
modifications are described above.
[00185]          Antibodies and functional fragments thereof according to the invention may be
further modified in various ways. For example, if they are to be used for therapeutic purposes,
they may be conjugated with polyethylene glycol (pegylated) to prolong the serum half-life or to
enhance protein delivery. Alternatively, the V region of the subject antibodies or fragments
thereof may be fused with the Fe region of a different antibody molecule. The Fe region used for
this purpose may be modified so that it does not bind complement, thus reducing the likelihood
of inducing cell lysis in the patient when the fusion protein is used as a therapeutic agent. In
addition, the subject antibodies or functional fragments thereof may be conjugated with human
serum albumin to enhance the serum half-life of the antibody or fragment thereof. Another
useful fusion partner for the inventive antibodies or fragments thereof is transthyretin (TTR).
TTR has the capacity to form a tetramer, thus an antibody-TTR fusion protein can for          a
multivalent antibody which may increase its binding avidity.
[001861          Alternatively, substantial modifications in the functional and/or biochemical
characteristics of the antibodies and fragments described herein may be achieved by creating
substitutions in the amino acid sequence of the heavy and light chains that differ significantly in
their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the molecular backbone in the area of the
substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of
the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulkiness of the side chain. A "conservative amino acid
substitution" may involve a substitution of a native amino acid residue with a nonnative residue
that has little or no effect on the polarity or charge of the amino acid residue at that position.
Furthermore, any native residue in the polypeptide may also be substituted with alanine, as has
been previously described for alanine scanning mutagenesis.

[001871          Amino acid substitutions (whether conservative or non-conservative) of the
subject antibodies can be implemented by those skilled in the art by applying routine techniques.
Amino acid substitutions can be used to identify important residues of the antibodies provided
herein, or to increase or decrease the affinity of these antibodies for human DKK1 or for
modifying the binding affinity of other anti-DKK1 antibodies described herein.
[00188]          The anti-DKK1 antibodies and immunological functional fragments can be
prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. For example, anti-DKK1 antibodies
may be produced by recombinant expression systems, using any technique known in the art. See,
for example, Monoclonal Antibodies, Hybridomas: A New Dimension in Biological Analyses,
Kennet et al. (eds.) Plenum Press, New York (1980): and Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual,
Harlow and Lane (eds.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1988).
[00189]          Antibodies of the present invention can be expressed in hybridoma cell lines or in
cell lines other than hybridomas. Expression constructs encoding the antibodies can be used to
transform a mammalian, insect or microbial host cell. Transformation can be performed using
any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell, including, for example
packaging the polynucleotide in a virus or bacteriophage and transducing a host cell with the
construct by transfection procedures known in the art, as exemplified by U.S. Pat. Nos.
4,399,216, 4,912,040, 4,740,461, and 4,959,455. The optimal transformation procedure used will
depend upon which type of host cell is being transformed. Methods for introduction of
heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian cells are well known in the art and include, but are
not limited to, dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene
mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s)
in liposomes, mixing nucleic acid with positively-charged lipids, and direct microinjection of the
DNA into nuclei.
[00190]          Recombinant expression constructs of the invention typically comprise a nucleic
acid molecule encoding a polypeptide comprising one or more of the following: a heavy chain
constant region (e.g., CHI, CH2 and/or CH3); a heavy chain variable region; a light chain
constant region; a light chain variable region; one or more CDRs of the light or heavy chain of
the anti-DKK1 antibody. These nucleic acid sequences are inserted into an appropriate
expression vector using standard ligation techniques. In one embodiment, the 1IH10 heavy or
light chain constant region is appended to the C-terminus of the DKK1 -specific heavy or light
chain variable region and is ligated into an expression vector. The vector is typically selected to
be functional in the particular host cell employed (i.e., the vector is compatible with the host cell

machinery, permitting amplification and/or expression of the gene can occur). In some
embodiments, vectors are used that employ protein-fragment complementation assays using
protein reporters, such as dihydrofolate reductase (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,270,964).
Suitable expression vectors can be purchased, for example, from Invitrogen Life Technologies or
BD Biosciences (formerly "Clontech"). Other useful vectors for cloning and expressing the
antibodies and fragments of the invention include those described in Bianchi and McGrew,
Biotech Biotechnol Bioeng 84(4):439-44 (2003). Additional suitable expression vectors are
discussed, for example, in Methods Enzymol, vol. 185 (D. V. Goeddel, ed.), 1990, New York:
Academic Press, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
[00191]         Typically, expression vectors used in any of the host cells contain sequences for
plasmid or virus maintenance and for cloning and expression of exogenous nucleotide sequences.
Such sequences, collectively referred to as "flanking sequences" typically include one or more of
the following operatively linked nucleotide sequences: a promoter, one or more enhancer
sequences, an origin of replication, a transcriptional termination sequence, a complete intron
sequence containing a donor and acceptor splice site, a sequence encoding a leader sequence for
polypeptide secretion, a ribosome binding site, a polyadenylation sequence, a polylinker region
for inserting the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide to be expressed, and a selectable marker
element.
[00192]         Optionally, the vector may contain a "tag"-encoding sequence, that is, an
oligonucleotide molecule located at the 5' or 3' end of the coding sequence, the oligonucleotide
sequence encoding polyHis (such as hexaHis), or another "tag" for which commercially available
antibodies exist, such as FLAG, HA (hemaglutinin from influenza virus), or myc. The tag is
typically fused to the antibody protein upon expression, and can serve as a means for affinity
purification of the antibody from the host cell. Affinity purification can be accomplished, for
example, by column chromatography using antibodies against the tag as an affinity matrix.
Optionally, the tag can subsequently be removed from the purified antibody polypeptide by
various means such as using certain peptidases for cleavage.
[00193]         Flanking sequences in the expression vector may be homologous (i.e., from the
same species and/or strain as the host cell), heterologous (i.e., from a species other than the host
cell species or strain), hybrid (i.e., a combination of flanking sequences from more than one
source), synthetic or native. As such, the source of a flanking sequence may be any prokaryotic
or eukaryotic organism, any vertebrate or invertebrate organism, or any plant, provided that the
flanking sequence is functional in, and can be activated by, the host cell machinery.

[001941          Flanking sequences useful in the vectors of this invention may be obtained by any
of several methods well known in the art. Typically, flanking sequences useful herein will have
been previously identified by mapping and/or by restriction endonuclease digestion and can thus
be isolated from the proper tissue source using the appropriate restriction endonucleases. In some
cases, the full nucleotide sequence of a flanking sequence may be known. Here, the flanking
sequence may be synthesized using the methods described herein for nucleic acid synthesis or
cloning.
[00195]          Where all or only a portion of the flanking sequence is known, it may be obtained
using PCR and/or by screening a genomic library with a suitable oligonucleotide and/or flanking
sequence fragment from the same or another species. Where the flanking sequence is not known,
a fragment of DNA containing a flanking sequence may be isolated from a larger piece of DNA
that may contain, for example, a coding sequence or even another gene or genes. Isolation may
be accomplished by restriction endonuclease digestion to produce the proper DNA fragment
followed by isolation using agarose gel purification, QiagenTM column chromatography
(Chatsworth, Calif), or other methods known to the skilled artisan. The selection of suitable
enzymes to accomplish this purpose will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.
[00196]          An origin of replication is typically a part of prokaryotic expression vectors,
particularly those purchased commercially, and the origin aids in the amplification of the vector
in a host cell. If the vector of choice does not contain an origin of replication site, one may be
chemically synthesized based on a known sequence, and ligated into the vector. For example, the
origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) is
suitable for most gram-negative bacteria and various origins (e.g., SV40, polyoma, adenovirus,
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), or papillomaviruses such as HPV or BPV) are useful for
cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, a mammalian origin of replication is not needed
for mammalian expression vectors (for example, the SV40 origin is often used only because it
contains the early promoter).
[001971          The expression and cloning vectors of the present invention will typically contain
a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and operably linked to nucleic acid encoding
the anti-DKK1 antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof Promoters are
untranscribed sequences located upstream (i.e., 5') to the start codon of a structural gene
(generally within about 100 to 1000 bp) that control transcription of the structural gene.
Promoters are conventionally grouped into one of two classes: inducible promoters and
constitutive promoters. Inducible promoters initiate increased levels of transcription from DNA
                                                   68

under their control in response to some change in culture conditions, such as the presence or
absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature. Constitutive promoters, on the other hand,
initiate continuous gene product production; that is, there is little or no experimental control over
gene expression. A large number of promoters, recognized by a variety of potential host cells, are
well known. A suitable promoter is operably linked to the DNA encoding anti-DKKI1 antibody
by removing the promoter from the source DNA by restriction enzyme digestion or amplifying
the promoter by polymerase chain reaction and inserting the desired promoter sequence into the
vector.
[00198]           Suitable promoters for use with yeast hosts are also well known in the art. Yeast
enhancers are advantageously used with yeast promoters. Suitable promoters for use with
mammalian host cells are well known and include, but are not limited to, those obtained from the
genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2),
bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, retroviruses, hepatitis-B virus and
-most preferably Simian Virus 40 (SV40). Other suitable mammalian promoters include
heterologous mammalian promoters, for example, heat-shock promoters and the actin promoter.
[00199]           Particular promoters useful in the practice of the recombinant expression vectors
of the invention include, but are not limited to: the SV40 early promoter region (Bemoist and
Chambon, 1981, Nature 290: 304-10); the CMV promoter; the promoter contained in the 3' long
terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto, et al., 1980, Cell 22: 787-97); the herpes
thymidine kinase promoter (Wagner et al., 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78: 1444-45); the
regulatory sequences of the metallothionine gene (Brinster et al., 1982, Nature 296: 39-42);
prokaryotic expression vectors such as the beta-lactamase promoter (Villa-Kamaroff et al., 1978,
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 75: 3727-3 1); or the tac promoter (DeBoer et al., 1983, Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80: 21-25). Also available for use are the following animal transcriptional
control regions, which exhibit tissue specificity and have been utilized in transgenic animals: the
elastase I gene control region that is active in pancreatic acinar cells (Swift et al., 1984, Cell 38:
63946; Omitz et al., 1986, Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 50: 399409; MacDonald,
1987, Hepatology 7: 425-515); the insulin gene control region that is active in pancreatic beta
cells (Hanahan, 1985, Nature 315: 115-22); the mouse mammary tumor virus control region that
is active in testicular, breast, lymphoid and mast cells (Leder et al., 1986, Cell 45: 485-95); the
albumin gene control region that is active in liver (Pinkert et al., 1987, Genes and Devel. 1: 268

control region that is active in the liver (Kelsey et al., 1987, Genes and Devel. 1: 161-71); the
beta-globin gene control region that is active in mycloid cells (Mogram et al., 1985, Nature 315:
338-40; Kollias et al., 1986, Cell 46: 89-94); the myelin basic protein gene control region that is
active in oligodendrocyte cells in the brain (Readhead et al., 1987, Cell 48: 703-12); the myosin
light chain-2 gene control region that is active in skeletal muscle (Sani, 1985, Nature 314: 283
86); the gonadotropic releasing hormone gene control region that is active in the hypothalamus
(Mason et al., 1986, Science 234: 1372-78); and most particularly the immunoglobulin gene
control region that is active in lymphoid cells (Grosschedl et al., 1984, Cell 38: 647-58; Adames
et al., 1985, Nature 318: 533-38; Alexander et al., 1987, Mol. Cell Biol. 7: 1436-44).
[00200]          An enhancer sequence may be inserted into the vector to increase the transcription
in higher eukaryotes of a nucleic acid encoding an anti-DKK1 antibody or immunologically
functional fragment thereof of the present invention. Enhancers are cis-acting elements of DNA,
usually about 10-300 bp in length, that act on promoters to increase transcription. Enhancers are
relatively orientation and position independent. They have been found 5' and 3' to the
transcription unit. Several enhancer sequences available from mammalian genes are known (e.g.,
globin, elastase, albumin, alpha-feto-protein and insulin). An enhancer sequence from a virus
also can be used. The SV40 enhancer, the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma
enhancer, and adenovirus enhancers are exemplary enhancing elements for the activation of
eukaryotic promoters. While an enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5' or 3' to a
nucleic acid molecule, it is typically placed at a site 5' to the promoter.
[00201]          In expression vectors, a transcription termination sequence is typically located 3'
of the end of a polypeptide-coding region and serves to terminate transcription. A transcription
termination sequence used for expression in prokaryotic cells typically is a G-C rich fragment
followed by a poly-T sequence. While the sequence is easily cloned from a library or even
purchased commercially as part of a vector, it can also be readily synthesized using methods for
nucleic acid synthesis such as those described herein.
[00202]          A selectable marker gene element encodes a protein necessary for the survival and
growth of a host cell grown in a selective culture medium. Typical selection marker genes used
in expression vectors encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g.,
ampicillin, tetracycline, or kanamycin for prokaryotic host cells; (b) complement auxotrophic
deficiencies of the cell; or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media.
Examples of selectable markers include the kanamycin resistance gene, the ampicillin resistance

A-1574-WO-PCT
gene and the tetracycline resistance gene. A bacterial neomycin resistance gene can also be used
for selection in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells.
[00203]          Other selection genes can be used to amplify the gene that will be expressed.
Amplification is a process whereby genes that cannot in single copy be expressed at high enough
levels to permit survival and growth of cells under certain selection conditions are reiterated in
tandem within the chromosomes of successive generations of recombinant cells. Examples of
suitable amplifiable selectable markers for mammalian cells include dihydrofolate reductase
(DHFR) and promoterless thymidine kinase. In the use of these markers mammalian cell
transformants are placed under selection pressure wherein only the transformants are uniquely
adapted to survive by virtue of the selection gene present in the vector. Selection pressure is
imposed by culturing the transformed cells under conditions in which the concentration of
selection agent in the medium is successively increased, thereby permitting survival of only those
cells in which the selection gene has been amplified. Under these circumstances, DNA adjacent
to the selection gene, such as DNA encoding an antibody of the invention, is co-amplified with
the selection gene. As a result, increased quantities of anti-DKK1 polypeptide are synthesized
from the amplified DNA.
[00204]          A ribosome-binding site is usually necessary for translation initiation of mRNA
and is characterized by a Shine-Dalgamo sequence (prokaryotes) or a Kozak sequence
(eukaryotes). The element is typically located 3' to the promoter and 5' to the coding sequence of
the polypeptide to be expressed.
[00205]          In some cases, for example where glycosylation is desired in a eukaryotic host cell
expression system, various presequences can be manipulated to improve glycosylation or yield.
For example, the peptidase cleavage site of a particular signal peptide can be altered, or pro
sequences added, which also may affect glycosylation. The final protein product may have, in
the -1 position (relative to the first amino acid of the mature protein) one or more additional
amino acids incident to expression, which may not have been totally removed. For example, the
final protein product may have one or two amino acid residues found in the peptidase cleavage
site, attached to the amino-terminus. Alternatively, use of some enzyme cleavage sites may
result in a slightly truncated yet active form of the desired polypeptide, if the enzyme cuts at such
area within the mature polypeptide.
[00206]          Where a commercially available expression vector lacks some of the desired
flanking sequences as described above, the vector can be modified by individually ligating these
sequences into the vector. After the vector has been chosen and modified as desired, a nucleic

acid molecule encoding an anti-DKKI antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof
is inserted into the proper site of the vector.
[00207]          The completed vector containing sequences encoding the inventive antibody or
immunologically functional fragment thereof is inserted into a suitable host cell for amplification
and/or polypeptide expression. The transformation of an expression vector for an anti-DKKJ
antibody immunologically functional fragment thereof into a selected host cell may be
accomplished by well-known methods including methods such as transfection, infection, calcium
chloride, electroporation, microinjection, lipofection, DEAE-dextran method, or other known
techniques. The method selected will in part be a function of the type of host cell to be used.
These methods and other suitable methods are well known to the skilled artisan.
[002081          The transformed host cell, when cultured under appropriate conditions,
synthesizes an anti-DKK1 antibody or functional fragment thereof that can subsequently be
collected from the culture medium (if the host cell secretes it into the medium) or directly from
the host cell producing it (if it is not secreted). The selection of an appropriate host cell will
depend upon various factors, such as desired expression levels, polypeptide modifications that
are desirable or necessary for activity (such as glycosylation or phosphorylation) and ease of
folding into a biologically active molecule.
[00209]          Mammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the art
and include, but are not limited to, many immortalized cell lines available from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC), such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby
hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells
(e.g., Hep G2), and a number of other cell lines. In certain embodiments, the best cell line for
expressing a particular DNA construct may be selected by testing various cell lines to determine
which ones have the highest levels of expression levels and produce antibodies with constitutive
DKK1 binding properties.
[00210]          In certain embodiments, the invention also provides compositions comprising the
subject anti-DKK1 antibodies or immunologically functional fragments thereof together with one
or more of the following: a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent; a carrier; a solubilizer; an
emulsifier; a preservative; and/or an adjuvant. Such compositions may contain an effective

use of the antibodies and immunologically active fragments that are provided herein in the

exemplary utilities.
[002111          Acceptable formulation components for pharmaceutical preparations are nontoxic
to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. In addition to the antibodies and
immunologically functional fragments that are provided, compositions according to the invention
may contain components for modifying, maintaining or preserving, for example, the pH,
osmolarity, viscosity, clarity, color, isotonicity, odor, sterility, stability, rate of dissolution or
release, adsorption or penetration of the composition. Suitable materials for formulating
pharmaceutical compositions include, but are not limited to, amino acids (such as glycine,
glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine); antimicrobials; antioxidants (such as ascorbic acid,
sodium sulfite or sodium hydrogen-sulfite); buffers (such as acetate, borate, bicarbonate, Tris
HCl, citrates, phosphates or other organic acids); bulking agents (such as mannitol or glycine);
chelating agents (such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)); complexing agents (such as
caffeine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, beta-cyclodextrin or hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin); fillers;
monosaccharides; disaccharides; and other carbohydrates (such as glucose, mannose or dextrins);
proteins (such as serum albumin, gelatin or immunoglobulins); coloring, flavoring and diluting
agents; emulsifying agents; hydrophilic polymers (such as polyvinylpyrrolidone); low molecular
weight polypeptides; salt-forming counterions (such as sodium); preservatives (such as
benzalkonium chloride, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, thimerosal, phenethyl alcohol,
methylparaben, propylparaben, chlorhexidine, sorbic acid or hydrogen peroxide); solvents (such
as glycerin, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol); sugar alcohols (such as mannitol or
sorbitol); suspending agents; surfactants or wetting agents (such as pluronics, PEG, sorbitan
esters, polysorbates such as polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80, triton, tromethamine, lecithin,
cholesterol, tyloxapal); stability enhancing agents (such as sucrose or sorbitol); tonicity
enhancing agents (such as alkali metal halides, preferably sodium or potassium chloride,
mannitol sorbitol); delivery vehicles; diluents; excipients and/or pharmaceutical adjuvants. (see

[00212]          The primary vehicle or carrier in a pharmaceutical composition may be either
aqueous or non-aqueous in nature. Suitable vehicles or carriers for such compositions include
water for injection, physiological saline solution or artificial cerebrospinal fluid, possibly
supplemented with other materials common in compositions for parenteral administration.
Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles.

Compositions comprising anti-DKKI antibodies or immunologically functional fragments
thereof may be prepared for storage by mixing the selected composition having the desired
degree of purity with optional formulation agents in the form of a lyophilized cake or an aqueous
solution. Further, the anti-DKK1 antibodies or immunologically functional fragments thereof
may be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipients such as sucrose.
[00213]          Formulation components are present in concentrations that are acceptable to the
site of administration. Buffers are advantageously used to maintain the composition at
physiological pH or at a slightly lower pH, typically within a pH range of from about 4.0 to about
8.5, or alternatively, between about 5.0 to 8.0. Pharmaceutical compositions can comprise TRIS
buffer of about pH 6.5-8.5, or acetate buffer of about pH 4.0-5.5, which may further include
sorbitol or a suitable substitute therefor.
[00214]          A pharmaceutical composition may involve an effective quantity of anti-DKK1
antibodies or immunologically functional fragments thereof in a mixture with non-toxic
excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. By dissolving the tablets in sterile
water, or another appropriate vehicle, solutions may be prepared in unit-dose form. Suitable
excipients include, but are not limited to, inert materials, such as calcium carbonate, sodium
carbonate or bicarbonate, lactose, or calcium phosphate; or binding agents, such as starch,
gelatin, or acacia; or lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or talc.
[00215]          Additional pharmaceutical compositions are in the form of sustained- or
controlled-delivery formulations. Techniques for formulating a variety of other sustained- or
controlled-delivery means, such as liposome carriers, bio-erodible microparticles or porous beads
and depot injections can be used (see, for e.g., PCT/US93/00829, which describes the controlled
release of porous polymeric microparticles for the delivery of pharmaceutical compositions).
Sustained-release preparations may include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of
shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules, polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (U.S. Pat. No.
3,773,919 and EP 058,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate
(Sidman et al., 1983, Biopolymers 22: 547-556), poly (2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (Langer et
al., 1981, J Biomed Mater Res 15: 167-277) and Langer, 1982, Chem Tech 12: 98-105), ethylene
vinyl acetate (Langer et al., ibid.) or poly-D(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988). Sustained
release compositions may also include liposomes, which can be prepared by any of several
methods known in the art. See e.g., Eppstein et al., 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82: 3688

[002161          The pharmaceutical composition to be used for in vivo administration typically is
sterile. Sterilization may be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. If the
composition is lyophilized, sterilization may be conducted either prior to or following
lyophilization and reconstitution. The composition for parenteral administration may be stored in
lyophilized form or in a solution. In certain embodiments, parenteral compositions are placed
into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial
having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle, or a sterile pre-filled syringe ready
to use for injection.
[002171          Once the pharmaceutical composition of the invention has been formulated, it may
be stored in sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or as a dehydrated or
lyophilized powder. Such formulations may be stored either in a ready-to-use form or in a form
(e.g., lyophilized) that is reconstituted prior to administration.
[00218]          The components used to formulate the pharmaceutical compositions are
preferably of high purity and are substantially free of potentially harmful contaminants (e.g., at
least National Food (NF) grade, generally at least analytical grade, and more typically at least
pharmaceutical grade). Moreover, compositions intended for in vivo use are usually sterile. To
the extent that a given compound must be synthesized prior to use, the resulting product is
typically substantially free of any potentially toxic agents, particularly any endotoxins, which
may be present during the synthesis or purification process. Compositions for parental
administration are also sterile, substantially isotonic and made under GMP conditions.
[00219]          The present invention provides kits for producing a multi-dose or single-dose
administration units. For example, kits according to the invention may each contain both a first
container having a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous diluent, including for
example single and multi-chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid syringes, lyosyringes or
needle-free syringes).
[00220]          The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be delivered parenterally,
typically by injection. Injections can be intraocular, intraperitoneal, intraportal, intramuscular,
intravenous, intrathecal, intracerebral (intra-parenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intraarterial,
intralesional, perilesional or subcutaneous. Eye drops can be used for intraocular administration.
In some instances, injections may be localized to the vicinity of a particular bone or bones to
which the treatment is targeted. For parenteral administration, the antibodies may be
administered in a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution comprising the desired
anti-DKKI antibodies or immunologically functional fragments thereof in a pharmaceutically

acceptable vehicle. A particularly suitable vehicle for parenteral injection is sterile distilled water
in which the anti-DKK1 antibodies or immunologically functional fragments thereof are
formulated as a sterile, isotonic solution, properly preserved.
[00221]          Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the subject anti-DKK1 antibodies and
functional fragments thereof may be administered by bolus injection or continuously by infusion,
by implantation device, sustained release systems or other means for accomplishing prolonged
release. The pharmaceutical composition also can be administered locally via implantation of a
membrane, sponge or another appropriate material onto which the desired molecule has been
absorbed or encapsulated. Where an implantation device is used, the device may be implanted
into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery of the desired molecule may be via diffusion,
timed-release bolus, or continuous release. The preparation may be formulated with agent, such
as injectable microspheres, bio-erodible particles, polymeric compounds (such as polylactic acid;
polyglycolic acid; or copoly (lactic/glycolic) acid (PLGA), beads or liposomes, that can provide
controlled or sustained release of the product which may then be delivered via a depot injection.
Formulation with hyaluronic acid has the effect of promoting sustained duration in the
circulation.
[00222]          The subject compositions comprising an anti-DKK1 antibody or functional
fragment thereof may be formulated for inhalation. In these embodiments, an anti-DKKI
antibody is formulated as a dry powder for inhalation, or anti-DKK1 antibody inhalation
solutions may also be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery, such as by nebulization.
Pulmonary administration is further described in PCT/US94/001875, which describes pulmonary
delivery of chemically modified proteins, and which is hereby incorporated by reference.
[00223]          Certain pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be delivered through the
digestive tract, such as orally. The subject anti-DKK1 antibodies or immunologically functional
fragments thereof that are administered in this fashion may be formulated with or without those
carriers customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules.
A capsule may be designed to release the active portion of the formulation at the point in the
gastrointestinal tract when bioavailability is maximized and pre-systemic degradation is
minimized. Additional agents can be included to facilitate absorption of the anti-DKKI antibody
or functional fragment thereof. For oral administration, modified amino acids may be used to
confer resistance to digestive enzymes. Diluents, flavorings, low melting point waxes, vegetable
oils, lubricants, suspending agents, tablet disintegrating agents, and binders may also be
employed.

[002241          The subject compositions comprising anti-DKKI antibodies or immunologically
functional fragments thereof also may be used ex vivo. In such instances, cells, tissues or organs
that have been removed from the patient are exposed to or cultured with the anti-DKKI antibody.
The cultured cells may then be implanted back into the patient or a different patient or used for
other purposes.
[00225]          In certain embodiments, anti-DKK1 antibodies or immunologically functional
fragments thereof can be delivered by implanting certain cells that have been genetically
engineered, using methods such as those described herein, to express and secrete the polypeptide.
Such cells may be animal or human cells, and may be autologous, heterologous, or xenogenic, or
may be immortalized. In order to decrease the chance of an immunological response, the cells
may be encapsulated to avoid infiltration of surrounding tissues. Encapsulation materials are
typically biocompatible, semi-permeable polymeric enclosures or membranes that allow the
release of the protein product(s) but prevent the destruction of the cells by the patient's immune
system or by other detrimental factors from the surrounding tissues.
[00226]          Dosage
[002271          The pharmaceutical compositions that are provided can be administered for
prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. An "effective amount" refers generally to an amount
that is a sufficient, but non-toxic, amount of the active ingredient (i.e., an anti-DKKI antibody or
immunologically functional fragment thereof) to achieve the desired effect, which is a reduction
or elimination in the severity and/or frequency of symptoms and/or improvement or remediation
of damage. A "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount that is sufficient to remedy a
disease state or symptoms, or otherwise prevent, hinder, retard or reverse the progression of a
disease or any other undesirable symptom. A "prophylactically effective amount" refers to an
amount that is effective to prevent , hinder or retard the onset of a disease state or symptom.
[00228]          In general, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the antibody or fragment can be
determined according to standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures and/or experimental
animals, including, for example, determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population)
and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio
between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio
LD50/ED50. Compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred.
[00229]          The data obtained from cell culture and/or animal studies can be used in
formulating a range of dosages for humans. The dosage of the active ingredient typically lines
within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The

A-1574-WO-PCT
dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of
administration utilized.
[0023 0]        The effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising anti-DKK1
antibodies or immunologically functional fragments thereof to be employed therapeutically or
prophylactically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One
skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for treatment, according to
certain embodiments, will thus vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the
indication for which the anti-DKK1 antibody is being used, the route of administration, and the
size (body weight, body surface or organ size) and/or condition (the age and general health) of
the patient. A clinician may titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the
optimal therapeutic effect. Typical dosages range from about 0.1 pg/kg to up to about 100 mg/kg
or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In certain embodiments, the dosage may
range from 0.1 pg/kg up to about 150 mg/kg; or 1 pg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 5 pg/kg up to
about 50 mg/kg.
[00231]         The dosing frequency will depend upon the pharmacokinetic parameters of the
anti-DKK 1 antibody or immunologically functional fragment thereof in the formulation. For
example, a clinician will administer the composition until a dosage is reached that achieves the
desired effect. The composition may therefore be administered as a single dose, or as two or
more doses (which may or may not contain the same amount of the desired molecule) over time,
or as a continuous infusion via an implantation device or catheter. Treatment may be continuous
over time or intermittent. Further refinement of the appropriate dosage is routinely made by those
of ordinary skill in the art and is within the ambit of tasks routinely performed by them.
Appropriate dosages may be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data.
[002321         To treat a medical disorder by targeting DKKI, a composition comprising the
subject anti-DKK1 antibodies or immunologically functional fragments thereof may be
administered to the patient in an amount and for a time sufficient to induce a sustained
improvement in at least one indicator that reflects the severity of the disorder. An improvement is
considered "sustained" if the patient exhibits the improvement on at least two occasions separated
by at least one to seven days, or in some instances one to six weeks. The appropriate interval will
depend to some extent on what disease condition is being treated; it is within the purview of the
skilled physician to determine the appropriate interval for determining whether the improvement
is sustained. The degree of improvement is determined based on signs or symptoms, and may

also employ questionnaires that are administered to the patient, such as quality-of-life
questionnaires.
[00233]          Various indicators that reflect the extent of the patient's illness may be assessed
for determining whether the amount and time of the treatment is sufficient. The baseline value for
the chosen indicator or indicators is established by examination of the patient prior to
administration of the first dose of antibody. Preferably, the baseline examination is done within
about 60 days of administering the first dose. If the antibody is being administered to treat acute
symptoms, such as for example to treat a broken bone, the first dose is administered as soon as
practically possible after the injury has occurred.
[00234]          Improvement is induced by administering the subject anti-DKK1 antibodies or
immunologically functional fragments thereof until the patient manifests an improvement over
baseline for the chosen indicator or indicators. In treating chronic conditions, this degree of
improvement is obtained by repeatedly administering this medicament over a period of at least a
month or more, e.g., for one, two, or three months or longer, or indefinitely. A period of one to
six weeks, or even a single dose, often is sufficient for treating acute conditions. For injuries or
acute conditions, a single dose may be sufficient.
[0023 51         Although the extent of the patient's illness after treatment may appear improved
according to one or more indicators, treatment may be continued indefinitely at the same level or
at a reduced dose or frequency. Once treatment has been reduced or discontinued, it later may be
resumed at the original level if symptoms should reappear.
[002361          The subject anti-DKK1 antibodies and immunologically functional fragments
thereof can be used to detect DKK1 in biological samples. Such uses allow the identification of
cells or tissues that produce the protein or serve as a diagnostic for detecting pathological
conditions in which DKK1 is overproduced or underproduced. The antibodies and fragments
that are provided can also be used in methods to screen for a molecule that binds to DKK1. A
variety of competitive screening methods, for example, can be used. In some methods, a DKK1
molecule or fragment thereof to which an anti-DKK1 antibody binds, is contacted with an
antibody or fragment disclosed herein together with another molecule (i.e., a candidate
molecule). A reduction in binding between the antibody or fragment and DKK1 is an indication
that the molecule binds DKK1. Binding of the antibody or fragment can be detected using a
variety of methods, e.g., an ELISA. Detection of binding between the anti-DKK1 antibody or
fragment to DKK1 can be simplified by detectably labeling the antibody. In some methods, a
                                                   79

A-1574-WO-PCT
molecule that exhibits binding in the initial screen is further analyzed to determine whether it
inhibits a DKK1 activity (e.g., whether the molecule activates Wnt signaling).
[00237]         Activity of a DKKI inhibitor or a sclerostin inhibitor or combinations (e.g.,
respective binding agents) may be measured in a variety of ways. Binding agent-mediated
increases in bone mineral content or bone density may be measured using single- and dual
energy X-ray absorptometry, ultrasound, computed tomography, radiography, and magnetic
resonance imaging. The amount of bone mass may also be calculated from body weights or by
using other methods (see Guinness-Hey, Metab. Bone Dis. Relat. Res., 5:177-181 (1984)).
Animals and particular animal models are used in the art for testing the effect of the
pharmaceutical compositions and methods on, for example, parameters of bone loss, bone
resorption, bone formation, bone strength, or bone mineralization that mimic conditions of
human disease such as osteoporosis and osteopenia. Examples of such models include the
ovariectomized rat model (Kalu, Bone and Mineral, 15:175-192 (1991); Frost and Jee, Bone and
Mineral, 18:227-236 (1992); and Jee and Yao, J. Musculoskel. Neuron. Interact., 1:193-207
(2001)). The methods for measuring binding agent activity described herein also may be used to
determine the efficacy of other inhibitors.
[002381         In humans, bone mineral density can be determined clinically using dual x-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) of, for example, the hip and spine. Other techniques include quantitative
computed tomography (QCT), ultrasonography, single-energy x-ray absorptiometry (SXA), and
radiographic absorptiometry. Common central skeletal sites for measurement include the spine
and hip; peripheral sites include the forearm, finger, wrist and heel. Except for ultrasonography,
the American Medical Association notes that BMD techniques typically involve the use of x-rays
and are based on the principle that attenuation of the radiation depends on thickness and
composition of the tissues in the radiation path. All techniques involve the comparison of results
to a normative database.
[00239]         Alternatively, a physiological response to one or more binding agents can be
gauged by monitoring bone marker levels. Bone markers are products created during the bone
remodeling process and are released by bone, osteoblasts, and/or osteoclasts. Fluctuations in
bone resorption and/or bone formation "marker" levels imply changes in bone
remodeling/modeling. The International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) recommends using bone
markers to monitor bone density therapies (see, e.g., Delmas et al., Osteoporos Int., Suppl. 6:S2
17 (2000), incorporated herein by reference). Markers indicative of bone resorption (or
osteoclast activity) include, for example, C-telopeptide (e.g., C-terminal telopeptide of type 1
                                                  80

    WO 20121058393                                                          PCT/US20111/058025

collagen (CTX) or serum cross-linked C-telopeptide), N-telopeptide (N-terminal telopeptide of
type 1 collagen (NTX)), deoxypyridinoline (DPD), pyridinoline, urinary hydroxyproline,
galactosyl hydroxylysine, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (e.g., serum tartrate-resistant
acid phosphatase isoforn 5b). Bone formation/mineralization markers include, but are not
limited to, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), peptides released from N- and C-terminal
extension of type I procollagen (P1NP, PICP), and osteocalcin (OstCa). Several kits are
commercially-available to detect and quantify markers in clinical samples, such as urine and
blood.
[00240]         Upon administration, a therapeutic agent preferably reduces the level of one or
more markers of bone resorption, such as the serum level of C-telopeptide of type I collagen
(CTX). Accordingly, the invention further provides a method of monitoring therapy, i.e., the
physiological response to a sclerostin binding agent or other sclerostin inhibitor. The method
comprises administering a therapeutic, then measuring the level of one or more markers of bone
resorption. In addition, the method can comprise measuring the level of one or more markers of
bone formation before administration. The level of bone resorption marker during and/or after
treatment may be compared to a pre-treatment level, or alternatively may be compared to a
standard range typical of that patient population. One of ordinary skill in the art can readily
determine a suitable standard range by testing a representative number of patients of like age,
gender, disease level, and/or other characteristics of the patient population. The level of bone
resorption marker can be reduced by at least about 5% (e.g., about 10%, about 20%, or about
30%) by a single dose of therapeutic. In some embodiments, the dose of therapeutic reduces the
level of bone resorption marker at least about 40% (e.g., about 50%, about 60%, or about 70%)
compared to the level of the bone resorption marker prior to administering. In addition, the bone
resorption marker level may be reduced for at least about 3 days (e.g., about 7 days, about 2
weeks, about 3 weeks, about 1 month, about 5 weeks, about 6 weeks, about 7 weeks, about 2
months, about 9 weeks, about 10 weeks, about 11 weeks, or about 3 months) after administration
of a single dose.
[00241]         In addition to decreasing the level of bone resorption markers, the amount of
therapeutic administered to a patient also can increase the level of one or more markers of bone
formation, such as the serum level of BSAP, the serum level of P1NP, and/or the serum level of
OstCa. A single dose of therapeutic can increase the level of a bone formation marker by, for
example, at least about 5% (e.g., about 10%, about 20%, or about 3 0%). In some embodiments,
the dose of therapeutic elevates the level of a bone formation marker at least about 40% (e.g.,

about 50%, about 60%, or about 70%). In other embodiments, the dose of therapeutic increases
the level of one or more bone formation markers by at least about 75% (e.g., about 80%, about
90%, about 100%, or about 110%). In yet other embodiments, the dose of therapeutic increases
the level of a bone formation marker by at least about 120% (e.g., about 130%, about 1 4 0 %,
about 150%, about 160% or about 170%). In alternative embodiments, the therapeutic increases
the level of bone formation marker by least about 180% (e.g., about 190% or about 200%). Bone
formation marker levels ideally remain elevated (compared to bone formation marker levels pre
treatment or to a standard range typical of that patient population) for at least about 3 days (e.g.,
about 7 days, about 2 weeks, about 3 weeks, about I month, about 5 weeks, about 6 weeks, about
7 weeks, about 2 months, about 9 weeks, about 10 weeks, about 11 weeks, or about 3 months)
after administration of a single dose of the therapeutic.
[00242]          Typically, BMD is can be measured "total body" (e.g., head, trunk, arms, and
legs) or at the hip (e.g., total hip and/or femoral neck), spine (e.g., lumbar spine), wrist, finger,
shin bone and/or heel. In osteoporosis diagnosis, a patient's BMD is compared to the peak density
of a 30-year old healthy adult (i.e., a "young adult"), creating the so-called "T-score." A patient's
BMD also may be compared to an "age-matched" bone density (see, e.g., World Health
Organization Scientific Group on the Prevention and Management of Osteoporosis, "Prevention
and management of osteoporosis: report of a WHO scientific group." WHO Technical Report
Series; 921, Geneva, Switzerland (2000)). The difference between a patient's BMD and that of a
healthy, young adult is conventionally referred to in terms of the multiple of a "standard
deviation," which typically equals about 10% to about 12% decrease in bone density. The World
Health Organization proposed four diagnostic categories based on BMD T-scores. A BMD value
within 1 standard deviation of the young adult reference mean (T-score !-1) is "normal." Low
bone mass (osteopenia) is indicated by a BMD value more than 1 standard deviation below the
young adult mean, but less than 2 standard deviations (T-score<- 1 and>-2.5). A T-score of
more than 2.5 standard deviations below the norm supports a diagnosis of osteoporosis. If a
patient additionally suffers from one or more fragility fractures, the patient qualifies as having
severe osteoporosis.
[00243]          The therapeutic may be administered to a patient to improve bone mineral density
regardless of the patient's T-score. The therapeutic may be administered at a dose and for a time
period effective to increase BMD in the patient by at least about 1% (about 2%, about 3%, about
4%, about 5%, or about 6%). In some embodiments, BMD is increased by at least about 8% (e.g.,
at least about 10%, about 12%, about 15%, or about 18%). In other embodiments, BMD is
                                                    82

A-1574-WO-PCT
increased by the therapeutic at least about 20% (e.g., at least about 22%, about 25%, or about
28%) at the hip, spine, wrist, finger, shin bone, and/or heel. In yet other embodiments, BMD is
increased at least about 30% (e.g., at least about 32%, about 35%, about 38%, or about 40%). In
other words, the BMD can be increased to the range of about I to about 2.5 standard deviations
(preferably a range of about 0 to about 1 standard deviations) below the normal BMD of a
healthy young adult.
[00244]         Alterations in bone remodeling or modeling can lead to fluctuations in mineral
concentrations throughout the body. Bone is one of the principal regulators of calcium levels in
the bloodstream. Osteoclast-mediated bone resorption releases stored calcium into the systemic
circulation, while osteoblast-mediated bone formation removes calcium from circulation to
incorporate into bone tissue. In normal bone modeling/remodeling, these processes cycle to
maintain healthy, strong bone and maintain free calcium levels at about 8.5 mg/dL to about 10.5
mg/dL (e.g., about 2.2 mmol/L to about 2.6 mmol/L). Bone disorders, other illnesses, and even
certain therapies can disrupt systemic calcium levels with dire consequences. Hypercalcemia is
associated with high levels of calcium in the blood (e.g., greater than 12 mg/dL or 3 mmol/L).
Extraordinarily high calcium levels leads to, for example, fatigue, confusion, constipation,
decreased appetite, frequent urination, heart problems, and bone pain. Hypocalcemia is an
electrolyte imbalance indicated by an abnormally low level of calcium in the blood (e.g., less
than about 9 mg/dL or 2.2 mmol/L). Calcium levels of <7.5 mg/dL (<1.87 mmol/L) or less are
considered severe hypocalcemia and may be accompanied by clinical symptoms.

 [002461        The inventive methods need not cure the patient of the disorder or completely
protect against the onset of a bone-related disorder to achieve a beneficial biological response.
The methods may be used prophylactically, meaning to protect, in whole or in part, against a
bone-related disorder or symptom thereof. The methods also may be used therapeutically to
ameliorate, in whole or in part, a bone-related disorder or symptom thereof, or to protect, in
whole or in part, against further progression of a bone-related disorder or symptom thereof.
Indeed, the materials and methods of the invention are particularly useful for increasing bone
mineral density and maintaining the increased BMD over a period of time. In this regard, the
invention provides a method of treating a bone-related disorder, which method comprises (a)
administering one or more amounts of a sclerostin binding agent effective to increase BMD
measured for the total body (e.g., head, trunk, arms, and legs) or at the hip (e.g., total hip and/or

about   2 5 %, or 30% or more. One or more administrations of a pharmaceutical composition
comprising the sclerostin binding agent may be carried out over a therapeutic period of, for
example, about 1 month to about 18 months (e.g., about 2 months, about 3 months, about 4
months, about 5 months, about 6 months, about 7 months, about 8 months, about 9 months, about
10 months, or about 11 months). The method further includes (b) subsequently administering one
or more amounts of a sclerostin binding agent effective to maintain bone mineral density. By
"maintain bone mineral density" is meant that the increased BMD resulting from step (a) does
not fall more than about 1% to about 50% over the course of step (b) (e.g., about 6 months, about
9 months about 1 year, about 18 months, about 2 years, or over the course of the patient's life). It
will be appreciated that a patient can require alternate treatment phases for increasing bone
density and maintaining bone density.
[00247]           It is contemplated that the therapeutic use of DKK1 inhibitors, as described
herein, alone or in combination with another anabolic agent, e.g., a sclerostin inhibitor such as a
neutralizing antibody, is beneficial to any condition requiring bone repair whether it is
aggravated by an underlying bone loss condition or not. Particular examples of bone repair that
are not always associated with bone loss include fracture repair such as delayed healing or non
union healing. Thus, one of skill in the art will understand that certain indications described
herein may or may not be exacerbated by bone loss associated with, for example, osteoporosis, or
any other bone loss condition described herein. Thus in further embodiments it is contemplated
that compositions of the present invention are useful for improving outcomes in orthopedic
procedures, periodontal diseases, oral bone loss, dental procedures, dental implants, implant
surgery, joint replacement, bone grafting, bone cosmetic surgery and bone repair such as fracture
healing, spinal fusion, implant fixation (e.g., joint replacement such as hip or knew), non-union
healing, delayed union healing and facial reconstruction. One or more compositions may be
administered before, during and/or after the procedure, replacement, graft, surgery or repair.
[00248]           In another aspect, the use of the foregoing therapeutic modalities including
antibodies or immunologically functional fragments in the treatment of a variety of diseases is
disclosed. Certain methods, for instance, involve administering to a patient in need thereof an
effective amount of an antibody or immunologically active fragment as described herein to treat
arthritis, diseases responsive to stem cell renewal, inflammatory diseases, neurological diseases,
ocular diseases, renal diseases, pulmonary diseases, and skin diseases. Some treatment methods

involve treating rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or osteoarthritis. Certain antibodies and
fragments are used to treat a disease that: (a) is responsive to stem cell renewal and is selected
from the group consisting of diabetes, chronic heart failure and diseases of the muscle; (b) is an
inflammatory disease selected from the group consisting of Crohn's disease, colitis, and
inflammatory bowel disease; (c) is a neurological disease selected from the group consisting of
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease; (d) is an ocular disease
selected from the group consisting of macular degeneration and retinopathies; (e) is a renal
disease selected from the group consisting of end stage renal disease, chronic renal disease,
glomerulonephritis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, and IgA nephropathy; (f) is a pulmonary disease
selected from the group consisting of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis; or (g) is a skin disease resulting from chemotherapy
induced damage to the intestinal epithelium.
[00249]         Sclerostin inhibitors, e.g., sclerostin binding agents, have been shown to promote
bone formation and inhibit (or slow) bone resorption with minimal fluctuations in systemic
calcium levels (e.g., calcium levels fluctuate 10% or less from baseline serum calcium levels).
Thus it presents itself as a possible partner therapeutic with the DKK1 inhibitors presented herein
to increase therapeutic responsiveness.
[00250]         Several ailments and pharmaceutical therapies alter system calcium levels, and
thereby impact bone density in a negative way and as such therapeutics of the current invention
are useful, including combinations thereof, to treat bone loss in these conditions. Hypercalcemia
and hypocalcemia can result from, for example, chronic kidney disease, renal diseases, renal
failure, primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, pseudohyperparathyroidism,
hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, magnesium depletion, alcoholism,
bisphosphonate therapy, severe hypermagnesemia, vitamin D deficiency, hyperphosphatemia,
acute pancreatitis, hungry bone syndrome, chelation, osteoblastic metastases, sepsis, surgery,
chemotherapy, neoplasia syndrome, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, sarcoidosis,

Hodgkin's or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Crohn's disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, leukemia,
pneumonia, silicone-induced granulomas, immobilization, or drug therapy, such as
administration of thiazide diuretics, lithium, estrogens, fluorides, glucose, and insulin. In
addition, serum calcium fluctuations are a side effect of many existing bone-related therapies,
such as bisphosphonate and parathyroid hormone therapy. Because of the potentially life

threatening consequences of calcium imbalance, patients susceptible to hypocalcemia or
hypercalcemia may need to forego certain therapy options.
[00251]          Accordingly, the materials and method of the invention, particularly
combinations, are advantageous in treating patients that are susceptible or sensitive to unstable
calcium levels. The amount of sclerostin binding agent administered to a human in the context of
this aspect of the invention is an amount that does not result in hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia
(e.g., clinically-significant hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia). In addition, the invention provides a
method of treating a bone-related disorder in a human suffering from or at risk of hypocalcemia
or hypercalcemia or a human in which treatment with bisphosphonate, a parathyroid hormone, or
parathyroid hormone analog is contraindicated. The method comprises administering to the
human an amount of a sclerostin binding agent effective to increase the level of a marker of bone
formation, such as serum levels of BSAP, P1NP, and/or OstCa and/or reduce the level of a
marker of bone resorption, such as CTX.

EXAMPLE 1
Preparation of the human DKK1 (huDKKI1) immunogen
[00256]          The cloning of human DKK1 was as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,344,541 with
the following modifications. Two different epitope tagged versions of human DKK1 were used
as an immunogen, one contained the FLAG epitope and the other was an fc-fusion molecule.
Both epitope tags were appended to the carboxy-terminus of human DKKI using standard
molecular biology techniques obvious to those skilled in the art.
[00257]          The epitope tagged versions of human DKK1 were cloned into an expression
vector for expression in CHO cells. Human DKIK1 variants containing either the FLAG or Fc
epitopes were purified from conditioned medium for use as an antigen to generate anti-huDKK1
antibodies. Epitope-tagged huDKK1 was purified from concentrated conditioned media (CM).
Other protein production and purification procedures known to those skilled in the art may also
be used.
EXAMPLE 2
Immunization and titering
[00258]          Recombinant FLAG-tagged human DKK 1 (FLAG-DKK1) and recombinant Fc
tagged human DKKI (DKKI-fe) were used as antigens. Monoclonal antibodies against DKKI
were developed by sequentially immunizing XenoMouse         mice (Abgenix, Inc. Fremont, CA)
(see, e.g., United States Patent No. 7,435,871 and the description therein). XenoMouse animals
were immunized via footpad route for all injections. Anti-DKK antibody titers in the serum from
immunized XenoMouse mice were determined by ELISA.

Recovery of lymphocytes, B-cell isolations, fusions and generation of hybridomas
[00259]          Lymph nodes were harvested and pooled from each cohort. The total effluent was
collected as the CD90-negative fraction (most of these cells were expected to be B cells). The
fusion was performed by mixing washed enriched B cells from above and nonsecretory myeloma
P3X63Ag8.653 cells purchased from ATCC, catalogue CRL 1580 (Kearney et al, J. Immunol.

was 2.0 mL
[00260]         After ECF, the cell suspensions were carefully removed from the fusion chamber
under sterile conditions and transferred into a sterile tube containing the same volume of
Hybridoma Culture Medium (DMEM (JRH Biosciences)). The cells were incubated and then
centrifuged. The cells were resuspended in a small volume of Hybridoma Selection Medium
(Hybridoma Culture Medium supplemented with 0.5x HA (Sigma, catalogue A9666)), and the
volume was adjusted appropriately with more Hybridoma Selection Medium. The cells were
mixed gently and pipetted into 96-well plates and allowed to grow.

[00261]         After sufficient culture, hybridoma supernatants were screened for DKK 1-specific
monoclonal antibodies. In the Primary screen, the ELISA plates were coated with 50 pL/well of
Flag tagged rhDKK1 (2 pg/mL) then incubated at 4'C overnight. After incubation, the plates
were washed with Washing Buffer three times and then 200 plL/well Blocking Buffer were added
and the plates were incubated at room temperature. After incubation, the plates were washed
with Washing Buffer three times. Aliquots (50 pL/well) of hybridoma supernatants and positive
and negative controls were added, and the plates incubated at room temperature for 2 h.
[00262]         After incubation, the plates were washed with washing buffer. Fifty pt/well of
detection antibody was added and the plates incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After
incubation, the plates were washed three times with Washing Buffer and then 50 pL/well of
TMB was added, and the plates were allowed to develop for approximately 10 minutes (until
negative control wells barely started to show color). 50 pL/well stop solution was then added
and the plates were read on an ELISA plate reader at a wavelength of 650 nm. The cutoff point
OD was set at two-fold above the OD of the negative control.
[00263]         The old culture supernatants from the positive hybridoma cells growth wells based
on primary screen were removed completely and the DKK1 positive hybridoma cells were
suspended with fresh hybridoma culture medium and transferred to 24-well plates. After 2 days
a secondary confirmation screen was conducted where the positive hybridomas in the first
screening were confirmed in Flag tagged rhDKK1 coated ELISA (described as above) and Flag
tagged irrelevant antigen coated ELISA. Three sets of detection system for antigen coated
ELISA, one set for hIgG detection, one set for human Ig kappa light chain detection and the other
set for human lambda light chain detection in order to demonstrate fully human composition for

both IgG and Ig kappa or IgG and Ig lambda or IgG and Ig kappa plus lambda. Only hIgG
detection was used for irrelevant antigen coated ELISA. The three sets of antigen coated ELISA
procedures were identical to the descriptions above except the three different detection antibodies
were used separately. Final selection was based on a positive signal on antigen and a negative
signal on irrelevant antigen.

[00265]          Hybridomas secreting antibodies deemed to be of functional interest were single
cell cloned by limiting dilution. Screening of single-cell cloned hybridomas for DKKI antibody
was performed by ELISA as described above. Hybridoma clones were cultured in Hybridoma
Culture Medium and expanded using standard tissue culture techniques to produce exhausted
culture supernatant containing secreted monoclonal antibody. Freezer stocks of hybridoma
clones were also generated.
EXAMPLE 5
Selection of hybridomas producing neutralizing antibodies to human DKKI by bioactivity
[00266]         The hybridomas obtained as described in Example 2 were tested utilizing a
TCF/lef-luciferase reporter construct in which luciferase expression is under the control of the
canonical Wnt pathway. When cells transfected with this construct are exposed to biologically
active Wnt, luciferase activity is induced. The Wnt induced luciferase activity can be suppressed
by adding recombinant DKK1 protein to the cells that contain this construct. For the present
experiments, both Wnt3a and DKK1 first were added to the cells in amounts optimized to
                                                 91

suppress about 80% of the Wnt-dependent luciferase expression. The further addition of an anti
DKKI1 antibody with neutralizing activity to these same cells is expected to restore Wnt activity,
thus resulting in increased luciferase expression. Supernatants from the hybridomas were thus
tested to determine whether they were capable of restoring luciferase expression in cells
transfected with the Wnt/luciferase construct. Luciferase activity was quantified as described
below.
[002671         On day zero, freshly trypsinized 293T cells were plated on fibronectin-coated 96
well plates. The cells were then co-transfected with DNA encoding firefly luciferase and DNA
encoding renilla luciferase. On day 1, for each well, TCF/lef-luciferase DNA and 1 ng renilla
luciferase DNA in 30 ii of DMEM were mixed with Polyfect Transfection Reagent" (Qiagen
301107) and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature to allow formation of a PolyFect
DNA complex. Following this incubation, 100 pl of growth medium were added to the complex.
Then the culture medium was removed from each well and the complex in growth medium was
added to the well. The growth medium in the wells was removed three hours later and replaced
with conditioned medium containing Wnt3a, recombinant human DKIK1 and anti-DKK1
hybridoma conditioned medium.
[00268]         After three days, the cells were washed once with PBS, and to each well were
added passive lysis buffer. Plates were shaken for 20 minutes at room temperature to induce
lysis. Ten pl of lysate per assay were used to perform the assay in 96 well white plates according
to the manufacturer's protocol. Luminescent signals from firefly and renilla luciferases were
both recorded and the ratio of those signals was used to determine the EC50 and to plot dose
response curves. First, the substrate of firefly luciferase was injected into a well with cell lysate
and the luminescent signal recorded; then the substrate of renilla luciferase was injected into the
same well and the resulting second luminescent signal was recorded.
[002691         The stromal cell line ST2, derived from mouse bone marrow, was used as an
additional screen for isolating anti-DKK1 antibodies with neutralizing activity. In response to
Wnt3a signaling, ST2 cells differentiate into osteoblasts which express the osteoblast marker
protein alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The induction of ALP by Wnt3a in these cells can be
blocked by adding the Wnt inhibitor DKK1 to the culture medium. ALP expression can be
restored under these conditions by exposing the cells to an agent capable of neutralizing DKKI1
activity, such as a neutralizing anti-DKK1 antibody.
[002701         In summary, of the hybridomas were screened in the ELISA assay, 344 bound
DKK1 in the ELISA assays and 25 were positive in one or both of the neutralization assays

each of the three campaigns are shown in table 3. As can be seen from the cellular activities of
these antibodies those derived from the second (5.X.x) and third (6.X.x) campaigns, that is those
generated in the KL mice, in general exhibited better cell-based activities as is evident from the
lower EC50s than those generated in the first (2.X.x) campaign with the Xenomouse.

transfection of the host cell line with the expression plasmids the cells were grown in -GHT

allow for selection of the plasmid and recovery of the cells. Serum was then removed from the
medium and the cells were grown in GHT selective medium until they achieved > 85% viability.
This pool of transfected cells was then cultured in medium containing [150-300] nM MTX
followed by medium containing 500-1OOOnM MTX to select for high expressing cells.
[00273]         Anti-huDKK1-1 antibody expressing cell lines were expanded using aseptic cell
culture techniques. Cells were inoculated into a bioreactor upon expansion and the culture fed as
needed. At harvest, cells were centrifuged and conditioned media filtered. Human anti-huDKK1
antibodies were purified from conditioned medium on Protein A sepharose. Purified DKK1
antibody was buffer exchanged to the buffer of choice.
EXAMPLE 8
ELISA-based cross blocking assay
[00274]         Liquid volumes used in this example were those typically used in 96-well plate
ELISAs (e.g. 50-200 ul/well). Ab-X and Ab-Y, in this example were assumed to have molecular
weights of about 145 Kd and to have 2 DKK1 binding sites per antibody molecule. An anti
DKK1 antibody (Ab-X) was coated (e.g. 50 ul of 1 ug/ml) onto a 96-well ELISA plate for at least
one hour. After this coating step the antibody solution was removed, the plate washed with wash
solution and was then blocked using an appropriate blocking solution and procedures known in
the art. Blocking solution was removed from the ELISA plate and a second anti-DKK1 antibody
(Ab-Y), which was being tested for its ability to cross-block the coated antibody, was added in
excess (e.g. 50 ul of 10 ug/ml) in blocking solution to the appropriate wells of the ELISA plate.
[002751         Following this, a limited amount (e.g. 50 ul of 10 ng/ml) of huDKK1 in blocking
solution was then added to the appropriate wells and the plate was incubated for at least one hour
at room temperature while shaking and the plate was then washed. An appropriate amount of a
DKK1 detection reagent in blocking solution was added to the ELISA plate and incubated for at
least one hour at room temperature.
[00276]         The plate was then washed with wash solution and developed with an appropriate
reagent. The background signal for the assay was defined as the signal obtained in wells with the

coated antibody (in this case Ab-X), second solution phase antibody (in this case Ab-Y), DKK1
buffer only (i.e. no DKK1) and DKK1 detection reagents. The positive control signal for the
assay was defined as the signal obtained in wells with the coated antibody (in this case Ab-X),
second solution phase antibody buffer only (i.e. no second solution phase antibody), DKK1 and
DKK1 detection reagents. The ELISA assay needs to be run in such a manner so as to have the
positive control signal be at least 6 times the background signal.
[00277]          Ab-X and Ab-Y are defined as cross-blocking if, either in format 1 or in format 2,
the solution phase anti-DKK1 antibody was able to cause a reduction of between 60% and 100%,
specifically between 70% and 100%, and more specifically between 8 0% and 100%, of the
DKKI1 detection signal (i.e. the amount of DKK1 bound by the coated antibody) as compared to
the DKK1 detection signal obtained in the absence of the solution phase anti-DKK1 antibody
(i.e. the positive control wells). It will be understood by one of skill in the art that the term 'cross
block' is not intended to encompass only complete blockage of binding of the test molecule,
rather it can include a range of decreased binding less than 100% as described here. In one
example, an isolated antibody or fragment thereof that cross blocks the binding of antibody
depicted in SEQ ID NOs: 42 and 44 to human DKKI1 and/or is cross-blocked from binding to
human DKKI1 by the antibody depicted in SEQ ID NOs: 42 and 44. Antibodies that are cross
blocked from binding human DKKI by the binding of antibody depicted in SEQ ID NOs: 42 and
44 include those that have 60% reduction in binding to human DKK1, 70% reduction in binding
to human DKK 1, 80% reduction in binding to human DKK 1, 90% reduction in binding to human
DKK1 or 95% reduction in binding to human DKKI1. Antibodies that cross block binding of
human DKKI1 by the binding of antibody depicted in SEQ ID NOs: 42 and 44 include those that
reduce its binding by 60% in binding to human DKK1, 70% reduction in binding to human
DKK1, 80% reduction in binding to human DKKI, 90% reduction in binding to human DKK1 or
95% reduction in binding to human DKK1. Antibodies that were capable of cross blocking one
another are referred to herein as being in the same bin.
[00278]          In the event that a tagged version of DKK1 is used in the ELISA, such as a N
terminal His-tagged DKKl (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA; 2005 catalog number
1406-ST-025) then an appropriate type of DKKJ detection reagent would include an HRP
labeled anti-His antibody. In addition to using N-terminal His-tagged DKK1, one could also use
C-terminal His-tagged DKKI. Furthermore, various other tags and tag binding protein
combinations that are known in the art could be used in this ELISA-based cross-blocking assay

[00279]         The human anti-huDKKl neutralizing antibodies described herein recognize two
distinct epitopes as evident by the inability of the antibodies to cross block one another. The first
epitope is referred to as 1 1H10 that has been described previously (United States Patent No.
7,709,611). The second epitope is described below and is referred to as 5.25.1 (SEQ ID NOs: 42
and 44).
EXAMPLE 9
Characterization of human DKK1 epitopes that bind 5.25.1 antibody
[00280]         Human DKK1 contains two disulfide-rich domains located near the N-terminus
and at the end of the C-terminus, referred to here as the N- and C-terminal disulfide domains.
The N-terminal disulfide domain (hereinafter, "disulfide domain 1" or "D1") contains 55 amino
acids residues (amino acids 85-139 of SEQ ID NO:2) and has 10 cysteines forming 5
intramolecular disulfide bonds. The C-terminal disulfide domain (hereinafter, "disulfide domain
2", or "1D2") contains 75 amino acids (amino acids 189-263 of SEQ ID NO:2) and contains 10
cysteines that also form 5 intramolecular disulfide bridges. These two disulfide domains are
separated by a stretch of about 50 amino acids. Disulfide domain 2 (D2) of DKKI has been
proposed to have a molecular structure similar to the canonical colipase fold, the crystal structure
of which has been determined using porcine colipase (Aravind, A. and Koonin, E.V., Current
Biology 8:R477-479 (1998)). Intramolecular disulfide linkages among the 10 cysteine residues
in the N-terminal DIdomain of DKK molecule have recently been determined.
[00281]         Treatment with a reducing agent abolished the ability of DKK1 to bind 5.25.1,
thus indicating that the epitope targeted by this antibody is conformational (or discontinous) and
requires the maintenance of intact disulfide bonds in the D1 and D2 domains. To characterize
this conformational epitope, a strategy was applied that involved fragmenting human DKKI with
cyanogen bromide (CNBr) and several different proteases, then analyzing the fragments and
testing them for their ability to bind to the antibody. Digestion was also performed in the
presence of 5.25.1 to detect those amino acid residues or sequence regions that is protected from
proteolysis due to antibody binding. The resulting data permitted the location of the epitope(s) to
be elucidated. In essence, the DKK1 proteolytic digestion was carried out in the absence or
presence of antibody 5.25.1 and then subjected to HPLC peptide mapping. A partial or complete

reduction in the height of an HPLC peak and/or the detection of a newly generated peak in a
sample exposed to antibody may be observed.
[00282]         After each peptide digest, the reaction products were separated by HPLC, the
individual peaks were collected and the peptides identified and mapped by N-terminal
sequencing. To determine if the peptides could bind 5.25.1, they were subjected to real time
biospecific interaction assays with a BiaCore workstation, using a sensorgram surface covalently
bound with HuDKKI1 as a biosensor for binding. HPLC peptide mapping was performed under
standard conditions.
CNBr digestion
[00283]         CNBr cleavage of hDKK1 generated two large fragments. These were CNBrl
and CNBr2, which represented, respectively, D2 and DI disulfide domains. CNBrl consisted of
two peptides (amino acids 179-206 of SEQ ID NO:2 and amino acids 207-266 [or 274 if
including the added C-terminal flag peptide] of SEQ ID NO:2) held together by 5 disulfide
bonds. CNBr2 similarly consisted of two peptides (amino acids 32-122 of SEQ ID NO:2 and
amino acids 127-178 of SEQ ID NO:2), also held together by 5 disulfide bonds (Table 4). The
results of BiaCore analysis indicated that 5.25.1 was capable of binding significantly to CNBr2
but did not bind at all to CNBr1. Thus, it was concluded that 5.25.1 binds to an epitope region
located in D1 disulfide domain of HuDKK.
Trypsin digestion
[00284]         Human DKKI was next digested with trypsin, which cleaves after ARG and LYS
residues. About 200 pg of DKKI at 0.5-1.0 mg/mil were incubated in PBS (pH 7.2) for 20 h at
37oC with 8 pg of one or the other of these proteases to achieve complete digestion of the
DKK1.
[002851         HPLC chromatography of tryptic digests yielded multiple peaks, which were
collected, dried, and reconstituted into 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Table 4 depicts

  Peptide is derived from trypsin digestion of HuDKK1 in the presence of 5.25.1 antibody.
[00286]          Sequence analysis was conducted on the peptide peaks recovered from HPLC
after trypsin digestion. Peptide peaks containing peptide sequences without disulfide linkages
were also confirmed by LC-MS/MS analysis. Molecular mass of fragments containing multiple
disulfide-linked peptides was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometric
analysis (MALDI-MS). Two peaks, T2 (retention time 40.7 min using 1 mm i.d. column or 43.5
minutes using 2.1 mm column) and T3 (retention time 41.9 min using 1 mm i.d. column or 44.7
minutes using 2.1 mm column), were confirmed to contain sequences that mapped to disulfide
domain 1, while TI peptide (retention time 35 min in 1 mm C18 column or 36.5 min in 2.1 C4
column) mapped to disulfide domain D2. None of TI, T2, and T3 bound to 5.25.1 when tested by
BiaCore binding experiments. T2 and T3 are large peptide fragments consisted of five small
peptides (3 to 13 amino acids in length) held together by the five disulfide bonds in D1 domain
with amino acids 74-102, 103-115, 121-123, 124-134, 135-147 of SEQ ID:2 (Table 4). One
small segment of the sequence at disulfide domain 1 was missing from T2 and T3. This missing
sequence containing all Lys and Arg, was amino acids 116-120 (sequence of ARG-ARG-LYS
ARG) of SEQ ID NO:2.
[002871          Human DKKI was also incubated with 5.25.1 at a molar ratio of 1:1 to 1:3 in PBS
buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Aliquot of the DKKI1/antibody complex was then digested by
trypsin under conditions as described above. HPLC peptide mapping profile of the tryptic digest
is completely identical to that obtained from the DKK1 digest in the absence of antibody 5.25.1,
except that T2 and T3 peaks disappeared and a new peak T4 (retention time 41.3 minutes using 1
mm column or 44.3 minutes using 2.1 mm i.d. column) became detectable. T4 is also a the N
terminal domain D1 peptide, but only contains a single amino acid sequence with amino acids
74-147 of sequence ID NO:2 (Table 4). In Biacore binding assay, T4 binds to 5.25.1 and can
compete for 5.25.1 binding with Sensorchip surface-bound DKKI.

[002881         To further delineate the 5.25.1-binding epitope, HuDKKI was digested with
protease AspN and the resulting fragments analyzed as described above. Of the major HPLC
peaks generated by AspN digestion, peaks that bound antibody 5.25.1 were AspN1, AspN2 and
AspN3. Sequence analysis indicated that AspN 1 and AspN2 were derived from disulfide domain
D1. AspN1 and AspN2 were identical in amino acid sequence and each of them consisted of two
peptides held together by five disulfide bonds in disulfide domain D1. These two peptides
consisted of amino acids 78-104 and 105-141 of SEQ ID NO:2 (see Table 4). AspN3 is a partial
digestion product whose sequence contains both Domains D1 and D2 sequences. Two other
peaks, AspN4 and AspN5, were also isolated and confirmed to be disulfide-linked peptides in
domain D2, AspN4 or AspN5 does not compete with DKK1 for 5.25.1 binding.
Analysis of digestion results
[00289]         The above results indicate that 5.25.1 binds to non-linear epitopes of human
DKK1 located in disulfide domain D1. As exemplified in Figure 1, epitope regions are deduced
with the observations described in the following:
[00290]         Trypsin cleavage (R at position 102, and RKRRKR between positions 115 and
120 and K at position 134 in Figure 1) generates five peptides linked by disulfides. This D1
domain tryptic peptide fraction loses 5.25.1 binding activity.
[00291]         Antibody 5.25.1 can bind to DKKI to protect all cleavage sites on D1 domain
from trypsin proteolysis (R at position 99, and RKRRKR between positions 115 and 120 and K
at position 134). The obtained DI tryptic fragment, recovered at a distinct retention time, is a
single polypeptide chain, indicating that all Arg and Lys's in D1 are protected from proteolysis
and therefore are closely located at the epitope region or involved in epitope binding. Binding
activity is maintained in D1 fragments generated Asp N or CNBr cleavage. To maintain binding
activity, the observed minimal fragment size for D1 domain is amino acids 78-141, except that
Asp-N had clipped the peptide bond between Gly 105 and Asp at position 105, leaving this large
disulfide loop (formed between Cys 97 and Cys 111) not being connected together.
[00292]         CNBr cleavage for removal of amino acids 123-126 (sequence of ARG-HIS
ALA-MET) and AspN cleavage of Glyl 14-Asp 115 peptide bond do not influence CNBr2 and
AspNI (or AspN2) fragments from 5.25.1 binding, therefore, sequences in these region are not in
the epitope. A highly negatively charged region (amino acids 83-91) in D1 is resistant to GluC
and AspN digestion in the absence of Ab, indicating that this region is not accessible for
proteolysis (may be due to steric hindrance) and is also inaccessible to 5.25.1.

[002931         In summary, epitopes residing in HuDKKI1 for 5.25.1 binding include
discontinuous sequences at the N-terminal disulfide domain D1: amino acids 98-104, 107-121,
and 129-140 of SEQ ID NO:2. And the D1 domain disulfide bonds have to remain intact to
retain a correct conformation or three-dimensional structure for 5.25.1 to bind.
 EXAMPLE 10
Binding affinity of monoclonal antibodies against DKK1
[00294]         Analyses were performed to study the binding of human anti-huDKK1 antibodies
to DKK1 using BiaCore 2000 (BIACORE, Uppsala, Sweden). BiaCore allowed us to determine
the kd of the selected antibodies. Those antibodies with a lower kd are more desirable as they
bind hDKK1 longer than those with a larger kd, and thus are more likely to engender a greater
response. The binding sensorgrams were analyzed and the data are summarized below.

data in table 5 also indicated that those antibodies derived from the latter immunizations of the
KL mice yielded antibodies with more desirable Kd's. The binding to huDkk4 was also tested
for several of the antibodies to determine specificity and it was determined that human anti
huDKK1 antibodies had at least a 50-fold increased specificity towards DKK1 than to Dkk4,
with 5.25.1 and 5.32.1 exhibiting no detectable binding to Dkk4.
[002961          Interestingly when the sensograms generated from the BiaCore analysis of the
second campaign antibodies, which contained antibodies in both the 11 H 10 and 5.25.1 bins, were
analyzed it became apparent that differences exist between the bins. The antibodies from the
1 IH10 bin, at a given antibody concentration, gave a higher binding signal than did antibodies
from the 5.25.1 bin. An increased maximal signal is observed from the 11 H10 bin antibodies
(2.40.2 and 5.80.2 and 5.80.3).
[00297]          It was apparent from the BiaCore results that the human anti-huDKKI antibodies
varied in affinity for DKK1, and that the affinity for several of these to human DKK1 exceeded
the sensitivity limits of the BiaCore assay. Accordingly, the affinity of several of these
antibodies to DKK1 was further assessed by an equilibrium binding analysis using the more
sensitive KinExAm 3000. For these measurements, Reacti-Gel 6x beads (Pierce, Rockford, IL)
were pre-coated with human, cynomologous or mouse DKKI1 and blocked with BSA. One
hundred pM, 300 pM, or 1000 pM of the antibody was mixed with various concentrations of
human, mouse or cyno DKK1, ranging in concentration from 1 pM to 50 nM, and equilibrated at
room temperature for 8 hours. The mixtures were then passed over the DKK 1-coated beads. The
amount of bead-bound anti-DKK1 antibody was quantified using goat anti-human-IgG antibody
labeled with a fluorescent tag (Cy5; Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA). The amount
of fluorescent signal measured was proportional to the concentration of free anti-DKK1 antibody
in each reaction mixture at equilibrium. The dissociation equilibrium constant (Kd) was obtained
from nonlinear regression of the competition curves using a dual-curve one-site homogeneous
binding model using the KinExA software. Results of the KinExA assays for the selected
antibodies are shown in table 6.

Only 11H10 bin antibodies block binding of huDKKI1 to LRP6 and Kremin2
[00298]         The ability of 1 1H10 bin and 5.25.1 bin antibodies to block binding of DKKI to
the Wnt co-receptor LRP6 or to Kremin2 was examined using co-immunoprecipitation
procedures. Recombinant mouse LRP6-His and rhDKK1 -Flag or recombinant human kremen2
his and hDKK1-flag were pre-incubated with or without the anti-DKK1 antibody in HANKs
balanced salt solution with shaking overnight to allow complex formation.
[00299]         In figure 2A rhDKK1-flag was incubated with LRP6-His and 5 pg of one of the
neutralizing DKKI1 antibodies from either the 11H1O bin (5.80.1, 6.37.5 or rl1H1O) or the 5.25.1
bin (5.25.1, 5.77.1). The mixture was immunoprecipitated with an anti-his antibody that would
bind his-tagged LRP6 and pull down associated DKK1. The immunoprecipitated was then
subjected to Western blotting analysis using an anti-flag antibody that recognized rhDKKI.     In
this way DKKI1 associated with LRP6 in solution and the ability of neutralizing-DKKI
antibodies to compete for the binding of DKK1 to LRP6, and by inference to LRP5, could be
measured. In lane I only LRP6-His is included; lane 2 rhDKK1-Flag; lane 3 hLRP6-His +

antibodies, but not the 5.25.1 bin antibodies, can block the interaction of DKK1 to LRP6.
[00300]         In a similar manner the ability of the same aforementioned antibodies to block the
binding of DKK1 to Kremin2, and by inference to Kreminl, was determined (Figure 2B). In lane

[003011         The data indicated that all three 11H10 bin antibodies, but not the 5.25.1 bin
antibodies, can block the interaction of DKK1 to Kremin2. The data presented in this experiment
suggest that the two different antibody bins exhibit different mechanism of actions in the ability
to neutralize DKK1 activity on Wnt signaling.
EXAMPLE 12
In vivo activity of selected antibodies
[00302]         Experiments were conducted to determine whether neutralization of DKK1 in a
mouse animal model would cause an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) and in serum
osteocalcin, a marker for bone formation. The antibodies tested were 2.40.2, 5.32.5, 5.80, 6.37.5,
6.116.6 and were purified as described above.
[003031         In the first experiment four-week-old male BDF-1 mice (APR 233757, Charles
River) were injected subcutaneously over a three-week period with one of three doses of the
purified 2.40.2 monoclonal antibody (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg). Five mice were used per group.
Negative control mice were injected with vehicle (PBS), and positive control mice were injected
with parathyroid hormone (amino acids 1-34), which is known to stimulate increased bone
density in these mice (Dempster et al., Endocrine Reviews 14(6):690-709 (1993)). One hundred
pg/kg of PTH (1-34) was used per injection. The results for percent change in tibia bone mineral
density at three weeks are shown below in figure 3.
[003041         To compare the in vivo efficacy of the two different antibody bins, representative
antibodies were selected from each bin. The antibodies selected were 5.32.1 from the 5.25.1 bin
and 5.80.1 from the 11H10 bin. Both these antibodies bound mouse DKK1 with similar affinities.
Eight-week-old male BDF-1 mice (APR 233757, Charles River) were injected subcutaneously
over a two-week period with one of three doses of the purified monoclonal antibody (3, 10, or 30
mg/kg). Six mice were used per group. Negative control mice were injected with vehicle (PBS).
The data are presented in Figure 4 as percent change from baseline in bone mineral density of the

three weeks with 25 mg/kg of the respective antibodies (6.37.5 and 6.116.6). Ten mice were
used per group. Control groups were injected with vehicle (twice per week) or PTH (100 .tg/kg
five times per week). The data are presented below in Figure 5 as percent change from baseline

bone density to a similar degree as PTH.
[003061         An additional study was conducted with the rat 1 HI10 bin antibody in a rat closed
fracture healing model. The fully rat 1 1H1O bin antibody r1 1H10 was utilized in this study as a
surrogate molecule to the fully human antibodies described herein. The length of this study
precluded the use of the fully human DKK1 antibodies due to the rodent immune response
directed against human antibodies. Briefly a closed fracture was generated in femur of 7-7.5
month old male rats (see methodology in Example 14). The femur was stabilized by insertion of
a fine needle (18G) into the femur marrow space prior to fracture. The animals were then treated
with vehicle or rl lH10 (25 mg / kg two times per week). Fractures were allowed to heal for
seven weeks. At the completion of the study the fractured femur was analyzed for bone mineral
density, biomechanical strength and bridging. Anti-DKK 1 treated animals showed significant
improvement in all these parameters, indicating that Anti-DKK1 therapy will be useful for the
treatment of fracture healing, and other indications where bone regeneration is needed. Figure 6
shows the improvement in maximum load and BMD achieved with Anti-DKK1 treatment at the
fracture callus indicating the acceleration of fracture healing.
EXAMPLE 13
Detection of DKK1 in human and animal model serum and tissue samples
[00307]         The antibodies described herein have been used to detect DKK1 levels in human
samples, including but not limited to serum. To develop this type of assay it was important that
two antibodies be selected that did not recognize the same epitope, such as the two distinct
epitopes described herein. To assay for DKK1 in human serum or other tissues a standard curve
was first established using recombinant huDKK1. It was preferable that this standard curve was
established in human serum lacking, or containing low levels, of huDKK1. Typically the range of
the standard curve we use for serum is between 25 pg/ml and 10 ng/ml huDKK1, although this
range may need to be adjusted depending upon the minimal and maximal values of huDKKl
obtained in the samples being analyzed. An example of the protocol used is as follows, but
modifications obvious to those skilled in the art may be taken depending upon the specific
antibodies and samples utilized.
[003081         First the human serum to be analyzed was loaded into a non-binding half-area
plate. A predetermined amount of biotinylated-antibody from epitope X (such as 11H10) and a
predetermined amount of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled antibody from epitope Y (such

as 5.25.1) was added to the well with 50 mg/ml Rabbit IgG in I-block buffer to reach a total
volume in the well including serum of 60 pl. This mixture was placed on a shaker for 30 minutes
and then incubated at 4'C overnight.
[003091         Following the overnight incubation 50pl of solution was transferred into a 396
well plate. This plate was then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with mixing. The well
was washed with PBS and a detection solution was added. The plate was then analyzed on an
appropriate reader. The assay was run in duplicate and concentration of DKK1 in serum was
determined by comparison with the standard curve. The data are useful in determining whether
patients have altered DKKI levels in the tissue or serum sample being analyzed.
[003101         In addition to using the antibodies described herein for the detection of human
DKK1 in human serum, the antibodies can also be used to detect DKK1 in serum isolated from
animal models of disease. As a non-inclusive example, the protocol as described above was used
to detect DKK1 levels in a rat chronic kidney disease (CKD) model. An extract of diseased and
controls kidneys were prepared and the level of rat DKK1 protein was determined. The data are
shown in Figure 7 and demonstrate that DKK1 protein levels are approximately five-fold
elevated at 3-weeks after induction of kidney damage with the pharmacological agent. These
results indicate that DKK1 is involved in the progression of kidney disease and suggest that that
pharmacological modulation of DKKI is of therapeutic utility in kidney disease. Likewise, the
methods describes in this example can be used to identify other disease states where DKK1
modulation may have therapeutic utility.
EXAMPLE 14
[003111         Sclerostin and DKK1 are negative regulators of bone formation. Inhibition of
sclerostin by systemic treatment with a sclerostin monoclonal antibody (Scl-Ab) significantly
increased bone formation, bone mass and bone strength in animal models of osteoporosis (Li XD,
et al. J Bone Miner Res 2009; 24:578). Furthermore, treatment with Scl-Ab enhanced fracture
healing in animal models of bone repair (Ke HZ, et al. Trans ORS 2009; 34:22; Ominsky M, et
al. ASBMR abstract Sept 2009; Denver, CO). Similarly, neutralization of DKKI by systemic
administration of the monoclonal antibody r1 1Hi0 (DKKI-Ab) increased bone mineral density
(BMD) and strength at the fracture sites of mouse (Komatsu DE, et al. J Orthop Res 2010; DOI
10.1002/JOR.21078) and rat fracture models. We hypothesized that combination of Scl-Ab and
DKK1 -Ab may have a synergetic effect on stimulating bone formation and increasing bone
strength in fractured and non-fractured bone in an adult rat model.

[003121          Study Design: Seven to 7.5 months old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (mean
body weight 580g) underwent unilateral closed femoral mid-diaphyseal fracture as reported
previously (Bonnarens F, et al. J Orthop Res 1984; 2: 97-101). Briefly, an 18 gauge syringe
needle was inserted into the medullary canal through the femoral condyles, and served as an
internal fixation. The femur then underwent transverse fracture via blunt impact loading at the
anterior (lateral) aspect of the thigh. One day after fracture, animals (n=14-18/group) were
subcutaneously injected with either saline vehicle or Scl-Ab, or DKK1-Ab (r1 1H1O) or
combination of Scl-Ab and DKK1 -Ab (Combination). Both Scl-Ab and DKK1 -Ab were given by
subcutaneous injection at 25 mg/kg twice per week. At 7 weeks post-fracture, animals were
euthanized; the fractured and intact, contralateral (CL) femurs were collected for densitometry
and biomechanics. This study was approved by Amgen's Institution Animal Care and Use
Committee.
[00313]          Densitometry: Femurs were scanned ex vivo by DXA (GE Lunar PIXImus II) at
the fracture region (mid 30% of the fractured femur) or the corresponding region in the CL femur
to determine areal bone mineral density (BMD). Both femurs were also scanned using a desktop
micro-CT system (eXplore Locus SP, GE Healthcare, London, Ontario, Canada) and
reconstructed to a resolution of 30 pm. Bone mineral content (BMC, threshold of 800 mg/cc) of
the central 1 mm of the fracture callus were assessed after subtraction of the original cortex as
previously described (Taylor DK, et al. J Bone Miner Res 2009; 24:1043-1054). Callus bone
volume as a percent of total volume (BV/TV) was quantified using a variable threshold (570
mg/cc for vehicle, ScI-Ab and DKK1-Ab; 615 mg/cc for Combination). For the intact CL femur,
regions spanning 10% of the femur height at the midshaft (threshold 800 mg/cc) for cortical bone
and distal femur trabecular bone (threshold 450 mg/cc for vehicle and DKK1-Ab, 550 mg/cc for
Scl-Ab, and 600 mg/cc for combination) were examined. Average cortical bone area and
cancellous bone volume fraction (BV/TV) were assessed at these sites, respectively.
[00314]          Biomechanics: Femurs were tested in 3-point bending to failure at the center of
the fracture callus or at the midshaft of contralateral femur, and bone strength parameters were
assessed (MTS 858 Mini Bionix 11; span length = 20 mm; displacement rate = 0.1 mm/sec).
[00315]          Statistical analyses: GraphPad Prism (v. 5.01) was used to perform the statistic
analysis. Group variances were compared by F test. If the group variances were significantly
heterogeneous (p<0.05), the data were log-transformed and resubmitted assess the variance.
When differences between group variances were not significant, an unpaired t-test was used to
perform the group mean comparisons between the vehicle and Scl-Ab or DKK1-Ab. When

group variances remained heterogeneous (p<0.0 5 ), then the comparison was conducted using the
Mann Whitney test. Data reported as Mean + SE, and p<0.05 considered as significance.
[00316]         RESULTS: Fractured femurs: both Scl-Ab and DKKI-Ab showed similar
improvement of bone mass and bone strength at fractured callus, as demonstrated by an 11%
increase at diaphyseal BMD by DXA, and a 24-26% increase at BMC by pCT and a 40-60%
increase in BV/TV by pCT at central 1 mm of fracture callus; and a76-122% increase in peak
load of fractured bone, respectively, compared with vehicle. Combination treatment of Scl-Ab
and DKK1 -Ab greatly enhanced bone mass and bone strength at fractured callus, to levels
significantly greater than either one alone. Compared with vehicle, there was a 39%, 60% and
93% increase in diaphyseal BMD, BMC and BV/TV at central 1 mm of fracture callus,
respectively, in the Combination group. These changes led to a 230% increase in peak load in the
Combination group as compared with vehicle. In addition, BMD, BMC and BV/TV, and peak
load were significantly higher in the Combination group compared with ScI-Ab alone or DKK1
Ab alone groups.
[00317]         Intact contralateral femurs:
[00318]         DKK1-Ab did not significantly affect diaphyseal BMD, cortical bone area and
cancellous bone BV/TV and bone strength in intact contralateral femurs. However, Sel-Ab
significantly increased mid-diaphyseal cortical bone BMD by 6% and cortical bone area by 10%,
and distal femur cancellous bone BV/TV by 43%, respectively, compared with vehicle. These
increases in bone mass at both cortical and cancellous bone sites under Scl-Ab treatments
associated with a 17% increase in peak load compared with vehicle.
[00319]         Similar to the fractured bone, combination of Scl-Ab and DKKI-Ab significantly
increased contralateral femoral mid-diaphyseal BMD by 12%, cortical bone area by 17% and
distal femur cancellous bone BV/TV by 107%, and peak load by 27% compared with vehicle.
The mean values for diaphyseal BMD and distal femur cancellous BV/TV in Combination group
were significantly greater than those observed for the Scl-Ab and DKKI -Ab alone groups, while
cortical area and peak load in the Combination group were significantly greater by 15 % and 210%
than the DKKI -Ab alone group, respectively.
