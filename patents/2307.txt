                                      TECHNICAL FIELD
    [0002]         The present disclosure is in the field of genome editing.
15                                       BACKGROUND
    [0003]         Gene therapy holds enormous potential for a new era of human
   therapeutics. These methodologies will allow treatment for conditions that have not
   been addressable by standard medical practice. Gene therapy can include the many
   variations of genome editing techniques such as disruption or correction of a gene
20 locus, and insertion of an expressible transgene that can be controlled either by a
   specific exogenous promoter fused to the transgene, or by the endogenous promoter
   found at the site of insertion into the genome.
    [0004]         Delivery and insertion of the transgene are examples of hurdles that
   must be solved for any real implementation of this technology. For example,
25 although a variety of gene delivery methods are potentially available for therapeutic
   use, all involve substantial tradeoffs between safety, durability and level of
   expression. Methods that provide the transgene as an episome (e.g. basic adenovirus,
   AAV and plasmid-based systems) are generally safe and can yield high initial
   expression levels, however, these methods lack robust episome replication, which
30 may limit the duration of expression in mitotically active tissues. In contrast, delivery
   methods that result in the random integration of the desired transgene (e.g. integrating
   lentivirus) provide more durable expression but, due to the untargeted nature of the
   random insertion, may provoke unregulated growth in the recipient cells, potentially
                                                1

   WO 2013/044008                                                           PCT/US2012/056539
   leading to malignancy via activation of oncogenes in the vicinity of the randomly
   integrated transgene cassette. Moreover, although transgene integration avoids
   replication-driven loss, it does not prevent eventual silencing of the exogenous
   promoter fused to the transgene. Over time, such silencing results in reduced
 5 transgene expression for the majority of random insertion events. In addition,
   integration of a transgene rarely occurs in every target cell, which can make it
   difficult to achieve a high enough expression level of the transgene of interest to
   achieve the desired therapeutic effect.
    [00051         In recent years, a new strategy for transgene integration has been
10 developed that uses cleavage with site-specific nucleases to bias insertion into a
   chosen genomic locus (see, e.g., co-owned US Patent 7,888,121). This approach
   offers the prospect of improved transgene expression, increased safety and
   expressional durability, as compared to classic integration approaches, since it allows
   exact transgene positioning for a minimal risk of gene silencing or activation of
15 nearby oncogenes.
   [00061           One approach involves the integration of a transgene into its cognate
   locus, for example, insertion of a wild type transgene into the endogenous locus to
   correct a mutant gene. Alternatively, the transgene may be inserted into a non
   cognate locus chosen specifically for its beneficial properties. See, e.g., U.S. Patent
20 Publication No. 20120128635 relating to targeted insertion of a factor IX (FIX)
   transgene. Targeting the cognate locus can be useful if one wishes to replace
   expression of the endogenous gene with the transgene while still maintaining the
   expressional control exerted by the endogenous regulatory elements. Specific
   nucleases can be used that cleave within or near the endogenous locus and the
25 transgene can be integrated at the site of cleavage through homology directed repair
   (HDR) or by end capture during non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The
   integration process is determined by the use or non-use of regions of homology in the
   transgene donors between the donor and the endogenous locus.
   [00071          Alternatively, the transgene may be inserted into a specific "safe
30 harbor" location in the genome that may either utilize the promoter found at that safe
   harbor locus, or allow the expressional regulation of the transgene by an exogenous
   promoter that is fused to the transgene prior to insertion. Several such "safe harbor"
   loci have been described, including the AAVS1 and CCR5 genes in human cells, and
                                                2

   WO 2013/044008                                                            PCT/US2012/056539
   Rosa26 in murine cells (see, e.g., co-owned United States patent applications nos.
   20080299580; 20080159996 and 201000218264). As described above, nucleases
   specific for the safe harbor can be utilized such that the transgene construct is inserted
   by either HDR- or NHEJ- driven processes.
 5  [0008]          An especially attractive application of gene therapy involves the
   treatment of disorders that are either caused by an insufficiency of a secreted gene
   product or that are treatable by secretion of a therapeutic protein. Such disorders are
   potentially addressable via delivery of a therapeutic transgene to a modest number of
   cells, provided that each recipient cell expresses a high level of the therapeutic gene
10 product. In such a scenario, relief from the need for gene delivery to a large number
   of cells can enable the successful development of gene therapies for otherwise
   intractable indications. Such applications would require permanent, safe, and very
   high levels of transgene expression. Thus the development of a safe harbor which
   exhibits these properties would provide substantial utility in the field of gene therapy.
15 [0009]          A considerable number of disorders are either caused by an
   insufficiency of a secreted gene product or are treatable by secretion of a therapeutic
   protein. Clotting disorders, for example, are fairly common genetic disorders where
   factors in the clotting cascade are aberrant in some manner, i.e., lack of expression or
   production of a mutant protein. Most clotting disorders result in hemophilias such as
20 hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency), hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency), or
   hemophilia C (factor XI deficiency). Treatment for these disorders is often related to
   the severity. For mild hemophilias, treatments can involve therapeutics designed to
   increase expression of the under-expressed factor, while for more severe hemophilias,
   therapy involves regular infusion of the missing clotting factor (often 2-3 times a
25 week) to prevent bleeding episodes. Patients with severe hemophilia are often
   discouraged from participating in many types of sports and must take extra
   precautions to avoid everyday injuries.
   [00101          Alpha-i antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is an autosomal recessive
   disease caused by defective production of alpha 1-antitrypsin which leads to
30 inadequate A1AT levels in the blood and lungs. It can be associated with the
   development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and liver disorders.
   Currently, treatment of the diseases associated with this deficiency can involve
   infusion of exogenous A1AT and lung or liver transplant.

    [00111          Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of rare metabolic
   monogenic diseases characterized by the lack of functional individual lysosomal
   proteins normally involved in the breakdown of waste lipids, glycoproteins and
   mucopolysaccharides. These diseases are characterized by a buildup of these
 5 compounds in the cell since it is unable to process them for recycling due to the mis
   functioning of a specific enzyme. Common examples include Gaucher's
   (glucocerebrosidase deficiency- gene name: GBA), Fabry's (a galactosidase
   deficiency- GLA), Hunter's (iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency-IDS), Hurler's (alpha-L
   iduronidase deficiency- IDUA), and Niemann-Pick's (sphingomyelin
10 phosphodiesterase 1deficiency- SMPD1) diseases. When grouped together, LSDs
   have an incidence in the population of about 1 in 7000 births. These diseases have
   devastating effects on those afflicted with them. They are usually first diagnosed in
   babies who may have characteristic facial and body growth patterns and may have
   moderate to severe mental retardation. Treatment options include enzyme
15 replacement therapy (ERT) where the missing enzyme is given to the patient, usually
   through intravenous injection in large doses. Such treatment is only to treat the
   symptoms and is not curative, thus the patient must be given repeated dosing of these
   proteins for the rest of their lives, and potentially may develop neutralizing antibodies
   to the injected protein. Often these proteins have a short serum half-life, and so the
20 patient must also endure frequent infusions of the protein. For example, Gaucher's
   disease patients receiving the Cerezyme@ product (imiglucerase) must have infusions
   three times per week. Production and purification of the enzymes is also problematic,
   and so the treatments are very costly (>$ 100,000 per year per patient).
   [00121          Type I diabetes is a disorder in which immune-mediated destruction of
25 pancreatic beta cells results in a profound deficiency of insulin, which is the primary
   secreted product of these cells. Restoration of baseline insulin levels provide
   substantial relief from many of the more serious complications of this disorder which
   can include "macrovascular" complications involving the large vessels: ischemic
   heart disease (angina and myocardial infarction), stroke and peripheral vascular
30 disease, as well as "microvascular" complications from damage to the small blood
   vessels. Microvascular complications may include diabetic retinopathy, which affects
   blood vessel formation in the retina of the eye, and can lead to visual symptoms,
   reduced vision, and potentially blindness, and diabetic nephropathy, which may
                                                 4

   WO 2013/044008                                                             PCT/US2012/056539
   involve scarring changes in the kidney tissue, loss of small or progressively larger
   amounts of protein in the urine, and eventually chronic kidney disease requiring
   dialysis. Diabetic neuropathy can cause numbness, tingling and pain in the feet and,
   together with vascular disease in the legs, contributes to the risk of diabetes-related
 5 foot problems (such as diabetic foot ulcers) that can be difficult to treat and
   occasionally require amputation as a result of associated infections.
    [0013]           Antibodies are secreted protein products whose binding plasticity has
   been exploited for development of a diverse range of therapies. Therapeutic
   antibodies can be used for neutralization of target proteins that directly cause disease
10 (e.g. VEGF in macular degeneration) as well as highly selective killing of cells whose
   persistence and replication endanger the hose (e.g. cancer cells, as well as certain
   immune cells in autoimmune diseases). In such applications, therapeutic antibodies
   take advantage of the body's normal response to its own antibodies to achieve
   selective killing, neutralization, or clearance of target proteins or cells bearing the
15 antibody's target antigen. Thus antibody therapy has been widely applied to many
   human conditions including oncology, rheumatology, transplant, and ocular disease
   Examples of antibody therapeutics include Lucentis@ (Genentech) for the treatment
   of macular degeneration, Rituxan@ (Biogen Idec) for the treatment of Non-Hodgkin
   lymphoma, and Herceptin® (Genentech) for the treatment of breast cancer. Albumin
20 is a protein that is produced in the liver and secreted into the blood. In humans, serum
   albumin comprises 60% of the protein found in blood, and its function seems to be to
   regulate blood volume by regulating the colloid osmotic pressure. It also serves as a
   carrier for molecules with low solubility, for example lipid soluble hormones, bile
   salts, free fatty acids, calcium and transferrin. In addition, serum albumin carries
25 therapeutics, including warfarin, phenobutazone, clofibrate and phenytoin. In
   humans, the albumin locus is highly expressed, resulting in the production of
   approximately 15 g of albumin protein each day. Albumin has no autocrine function,
   and there does not appear to be any phenotype associated with monoallelic knockouts
   and only mild phenotypic observations are found for biallelic knockouts (see Watkins
30 et al (1994) ProcNatl Acad Sci USA 91:9417).
    [0014]          Albumin has also been used when coupled to therapeutic reagents to
   increase the serum half-life of the therapeutic. For example, Osborn et al (JPharm
   Exp Thera (2002) 303(2):540) disclose the pharmacokinetics of a serum albumin
                                                 5

   WO 2013/044008                                                            PCT/US2012/056539
   interferon alpha fusion protein and demonstrate that the fusion protein had an
   approximate 140-fold slower clearance such that the half-life of the fusion was 18
   fold longer than for the interferon alpha protein alone. Other examples of therapeutic
   proteins recently under development that are albumin fusions include Albulin-G TM,
 5 CardevaTM and AlbugraninTM (Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, fused to Insulin, b
   type natriuretic, or GCSF, respectively), Syncria@ (GlaxoSmithKline, fused to
   Glucagon-like peptide-1) and Albuferon a-2B, fused to IFN-alpha (see Current
   Opinion in Drug Discovery and Development, (2009), vol 12, No. 2. p. 288). In these
   cases, Albulin-GTM, CardevaTM and Syncria® are all fusion proteins where the
10 albumin is found on the N-terminus of the fusion, while AlbugraninTM and Albuferon
   alpha 2G are fusions where the albumin is on the C-terminus of the fusion.
   [0015]          Thus, there remains a need for additional methods and compositions
   that can be used to express a desired transgene at a therapeutically relevant level,
   while avoiding any associated toxicity, and which may limit expression of the
15 transgene to the desired tissue type, for example to treat genetic diseases such as
   hemophilias, diabetes, lysosomal storage diseases and AlAT deficiency.
   Additionally, there remains a need for additional methods and compositions to
   express a desired transgene at a therapeutically relevant level for the treatment of
   other diseases such as cancers.

                                           SUMMARY
   [0016]          Disclosed herein are methods and compositions for creating a safe
   harbor in the genome of cells, for targeted insertion and subsequence expression of a
   transgene, for example expression of the transgene from a secretory tissue such as
25 liver. In one aspect, described herein is a non-naturally occurring zinc-finger protein
   (ZFP) that binds to target site in a region of interest (e.g., an albumin gene) in a
   genome, wherein the ZFP comprises one or more engineered zinc-finger binding
   domains. In one embodiment, the ZFP is a zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) that cleaves a
   target genomic region of interest, wherein the ZFN comprises one or more engineered
30 zinc-finger binding domains and a nuclease cleavage domain or cleavage half
   domain. Cleavage domains and cleavage half domains can be obtained, for example,
   from various restriction endonucleases and/or homing endonucleases. In one
   embodiment, the cleavage half-domains are derived from a Type IIS restriction
                                                6

   WO 2013/044008                                                           PCT/US2012/056539
   endonuclease (e.g., Fok I). In certain embodiments, the zinc finger domain
   recognizes a target site in an albumin gene, for example a zinc finger protein with the
   recognition helix domains ordered as shown in a single row of Tables 1, 3, 5 or 8.
   [00171          In another aspect, described herein is a Transcription Activator Like
 5 Effector (TALE) protein that binds to target site in a region of interest (e.g., an
   albumin gene) in a genome, wherein the TALE comprises one or more engineered
   TALE binding domains. In one embodiment, the TALE is a nuclease (TALEN) that
   cleaves a target genomic region of interest, wherein the TALEN comprises one or
   more engineered TALE DNA binding domains and a nuclease cleavage domain or
10 cleavage half-domain. Cleavage domains and cleavage half domains can be obtained,
   for example, from various restriction endonucleases and/or homing endonucleases. In
   one embodiment, the cleavage half-domains are derived from a Type IIS restriction
   endonuclease (e.g., Fok I). In certain embodiments, the TALE DNA binding domain
   recognizes a target site in an albumin gene, for example TALE DNA binding domain
15 having the target sequence shown in a single row of Table 12.
   [00181          The ZFN and/or TALEN as described herein may bind to and/or cleave
   the region of interest in a coding or non-coding region within or adjacent to the gene,
   such as, for example, a leader sequence, trailer sequence or intron, or within a non
   transcribed region, either upstream or downstream of the coding region. In certain
20 embodiments, the ZFN binds to and/or cleaves an albumin gene. In other
   embodiments, the ZFN and/or TALEN binds to and/or cleaves a safe-harbor gene, for
   example a CCR5 gene, a PPP1R12C (also known as AAVS1) gene or a Rosa gene.
   See, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20080299580; 20080159996 and
   201000218264. In another aspect, described herein are compositions comprising one
25 or more of the zinc-finger and/or TALE nucleases described herein. In certain
   embodiments, the composition comprises one or more zinc-finger and/or TALE
   nucleases in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.
   [00191          In another aspect, described herein is a polynucleotide encoding one or
   more ZFNs and/or TALENs described herein. The polynucleotide may be, for
30 example, mRNA. In some aspects, the mRNA may be chemically modified (See e.g.
   Kormann et al, (2011) Nature Biotechnology 29(2):154-157).
   [00201          In another aspect, described herein is a ZFN and/or TALEN expression
   vector comprising a polynucleotide, encoding one or more ZFNs and/or TALENs
                                               7

   WO 2013/044008                                                              PCT/US2012/056539
   described herein, operably linked to a promoter. In one embodiment, the expression
   vector is a viral vector. In one aspect, the viral vector exhibits tissue specific tropism.
    [00211          In another aspect, described herein is a host cell comprising one or
   more ZFN and/or TALEN expression vectors. The host cell may be stably
 5 transformed or transiently transfected or a combination thereof with one or more ZFP
   or TALEN expression vectors. In one embodiment, the host cell is an embryonic
   stem cell. In other embodiments, the one or more ZFP and/or TALEN expression
   vectors express one or more ZFNs and/or TALENs in the host cell. In another
   embodiment, the host cell may further comprise an exogenous polynucleotide donor
10 sequence. Non-limiting examples of suitable host cells include eukaryotic cells or
   cell lines such as secretory cells (e.g., liver cells, mucosal cells, salivary gland cells,
   pituitary cells, etc.), blood cells (red blood cells), stem cells, etc. In any of the
   embodiments described herein the host cell can comprise an embryo cell, for example,
   of a mouse, rat, rabbit or other mammal cell embryo.
15 [0022]           In another aspect, described herein is a method for cleaving an albumin
   gene in a cell, the method comprising: introducing, into the cell, one or more
   polynucleotides encoding one or more ZFNs and/or TALENs that bind to a target site
   in the one or more albumin genes under conditions such that the ZFN(s) is (are) or
   TALENs is (are) expressed and the one or more albumin genes are cleaved.
20 [00231           In other embodiments, a genomic sequence in any target gene is
   replaced, for example using a ZFN or TALEN (or vector encoding said ZFN or
   TALEN) as described herein and a "donor" sequence (e.g., transgene) that is inserted
   into the gene following targeted cleavage with the ZFN and/or TALEN. The donor
   sequence may be present in the ZFN or TALEN vector, present in a separate vector
25 (e.g., Ad or LV vector) or, alternatively, may be introduced into the cell using a
   different nucleic acid delivery mechanism. Such insertion of a donor nucleotide
   sequence into the target locus (e.g., albumin gene, other safe-harbor gene, etc.) results
   in the expression of the transgene carried by the donor under control of the target
   locus's (e.g. albumin) genetic control elements. In some aspects, insertion of the
30 transgene of interest, for example into an albumin gene results in expression of an
   intact exogenous protein sequence and lacks any albumin encoded amino acids. In
   other aspects, the expressed exogenous protein is a fusion protein and comprises
   amino acids encoded by the transgene and by an albumin gene (e.g., from the
                                                  8

   WO 2013/044008                                                          PCT/US2012/056539
   endogenous target locus or, alternatively from albumin-encoding sequences on the
   transgene). In some instances, the albumin sequences will be present on the amino
   (N)-terminal portion of the exogenous protein, while in others, the albumin sequences
   will be present on the carboxy (C)- terminal portion of the exogenous protein. In
 5 other instances, albumin sequences will be present on both the N- and C-terminal
   portions of the exogenous protein. The albumin sequences may include full-length
   wild-type or mutant albumin sequences or, alternatively, may include partial albumin
   amino acid sequences. In certain embodiments, the albumin sequences (full-length or
   partial) serve to increase the serum half-life of the polypeptide expressed by the
10 transgene to which it is fused and/or as a carrier. In some embodiments, the albumin
   transgene fusion is located at the endogenous locus within the cell while in other
   embodiments, the albumin-transgene coding sequence is inserted into a safe harbor
   within a genome. In some aspects, the safe harbor is selected from the AAVS 1, Rosa,
   HPRT or CCR5 locus (see co-owned US patent publications Nos. 20080299580;
15 20080159996 and 201000218264, and US Provisional patent application No.
   61/556,691).
    10024]          In another aspect, the invention describes methods and compositions
   that can be used to express a transgene under the control of an albumin promoter in
   vivo (e.g., endogenous or exogenous albumin promoter). In some aspects, the
20 transgene may encode a therapeutic protein of interest. The transgene may encode a
   protein such that the methods of the invention can be used for production of protein
   that is deficient or lacking (e.g., "protein replacement"). In some instances, the
   protein may be involved treatment for a lysosomal storage disease. Other therapeutic
   proteins may be expressed, including protein therapeutics for conditions as diverse as
25 epidermolysis bullosa or AAT deficient emphysema. In other aspects, the transgene
   may comprise sequences (e.g., engineered sequences) such that the expressed protein
   has characteristics which give it novel and desirable features (increased half-life,
   changed plasma clearance characteristics etc.). Engineered sequences can also
   include amino acids derived from the albumin sequence. In some aspects, the
30 transgenes encode therapeutic proteins, therapeutic hormones, plasma proteins,
   antibodies and the like. In some aspects, the transgenes may encode proteins involved
   in blood disorders such as clotting disorders. In some aspects, the transgenes encode

    [00251          In some embodiments, the methods of the invention may be used in
   vivo in transgenic animal systems. In some aspects, the transgenic animal may be
   used in model development where the transgene encodes a human gene. In some
   instances, the transgenic animal may be knocked out at the corresponding endogenous
 5 locus, allowing the development of an in vivo system where the human protein may
   be studied in isolation. Such transgenic models may be used for screening purposes to
   identify small molecule, large biomolecules or other entities which may interact or
   modify the human protein of interest. In other aspects, the transgenic animals may be
   used for production purposes, for example, to produce antibodies or other
10 biomolecules of interest. In certain embodiments, the animal is a small mammal, for
   example a dog, rabbit or a rodent such as rat, a mouse or a guinea pig. In other
   embodiments, the animal is a non-human primate. In yet further embodiments, the
   animal is a farm animal such as a cow, goat or pig. In some aspects, the transgene is
   integrated into the selected locus (e.g., albumin or safe-harbor) into a stem cell (e.g.,
15 an embryonic stem cell, an induced pluripotent stem cell, a hepatic stem cell, etc.) or
   animal embryo obtained by any of the methods described herein, and then the embryo
   is implanted such that a live animal is born. The animal is then raised to sexual
   maturity and allowed to produce offspring wherein at least some of the offspring
   comprise the integrated transgene.
20 [00261           In a still further aspect, provided herein is a method for site specific
   integration of a nucleic acid sequence into an endogenous locus (e.g., albumin gene)
   of a chromosome, for example into the chromosome of an embryo. In certain
   embodiments, the method comprises: (a) injecting an embryo with (i) at least one
   DNA vector, wherein the DNA vector comprises an upstream sequence and a
25 downstream sequence flanking the nucleic acid sequence to be integrated, and (ii) at
   least one RNA molecule encoding a zinc finger and/or TALE nuclease that recognizes
   the site of integration in the target locus (e.g., albumin locus), and (b) culturing the
   embryo to allow expression of the zinc finger and/or TALE nuclease, wherein a
   double stranded break introduced into the site of integration by the zinc finger
30 nuclease or TALEN is repaired, via homologous recombination with the DNA vector,
   so as to integrate the nucleic acid sequence into the chromosome.
   100271           Suitable embryos may be derived from several different vertebrate
   species, including mammalian, bird, reptile, amphibian, and fish species. Generally

   speaking, a suitable embryo is an embryo that may be collected, injected, and cultured
   to allow the expression of a zinc finger or TALE nuclease. In some embodiments,

   normal controls wherein the patient derived iPSC can be mutated to normal gene
20 sequence at the gene of interest, or normal cells can be altered to the known disease
   allele at the gene of interest. Similarly, the hepatic stem cells can be isolated from a
   patient. These cells are then engineered to express the transgene of interest, expanded
   and then reintroduced into the patient.

 5  screening of drug libraries and/or other therapeutic compositions (i.e., antibodies,
    structural RNAs, etc.) for use in treatment of an animal afflicted with a clotting factor
    disorder. Such screens can begin at the cellular level with manipulated cell lines or
    primary cells, and can progress up to the level of treatment of a whole animal (e.g.,
    human).

20                      BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
   [00581          Figure 1, panels A and B, are gels depicting the results of a Cel-I
   mismatch assay (SurveyorTM, Transgenomic) that quantifies the degree to which ZFN
   cleavage of an endogenous chromosomal target, followed by imperfect repair via
   NHEJ, has yielded small insertions or deletions ("indels") of the targeted locus. For a
25 description of the assay see Horton et al. Methods Mol Biol. (2010) 649:247-56.
   Figure 1A shows results using expression constructs for ZFNs targeted to the mouse
   albumin gene which were transfected into Neuro2A cells, where the cells were treated
   for 3 days at 37'C following transfection, and then analyzed for the fraction of
   modified target sites via Cel-I analysis. Figure 1B shows results for the same ZFNs
30 and cells as Figure 1A except cells were subjected to hypothermic shock (30'C)
   during their 3 days of growth following transfection. The percent mismatch, or %
   indels shown at the bottom on the lanes, is a measure of the ZFN activity and
                                                14

    demonstrates that the mouse albumin specific ZFNs are able to induce up to 53%
    indels following cleavage of their endogenous chromosomal target in Neuro 2A cells.
    [00591           Figure 2, panels A and B, are gels depicting the results of a Cel-I
    mismatch assay carried out on canine D17 cells transfected with constructs expressing
 5  the canine albumin specific ZFN pair SBS 33115/SBS34077 at two concentrations of
    plasmid DNA, 20 or 40 ng. Figure 2A depicts the results after 3 days while Figure 2B
    depicts the results after 10 days. This ZFN pair was able to induce indels in ~25-30%
    of target site sequences at day 3.
    [00601           Figure 3, panels A and B, show alignments of the albumin genes from
10  a variety of species of interest. Figure 3A shows an alignment of exon 1 and the 5'
    region of intron 1 of human (H sapiens, SEQ ID NO:160), rhesus macaque monkeys
    (M mulatta, SEQ ID NO:73), marmoset (C. jacchus, SEQ ID NO:74), dog (C.
   familiaris, SEQ ID NO:75), rat (R. norvegicus, SEQ ID NO:75) and mouse (M
    musculus, SEQ ID NO:76). 3B shows an alignment of the remainder of intron 1 and
15  a small fragment of exon 2. This region includes the Locus I to Locus 5 of human
    (SEQ ID NO:161), rhesus macaque monkeys (SEQ ID NO:77), marmoset (SEQ ID
    NO:78), dog (SEQ ID NO:79), rat (SEQ ID NO:80) and mouse (M musculus, SEQ
    ID NO:81) which are loci in the albumin gene chosen for ZFN targeting. The
    sequences depicted show the starting codon ATG (large box in Figure 3A) and the
20  boundaries of exon1 and intron 1 (Figure 3A) and intron 1 and exon 2 (Figure 3B).
    10061]           Figure 4, panels A and B, depict the results of a Cel-I mismatch assay
    carried out on genomic DNA from liver tissue biopsied from mice injected with
    albumin-specific ZFNs expressed from a hepatotrophic AAV8 vector. The results are
    from 10 wild type mice (numbers 273- 282) injected intravenously via tail vein
25  injection with two sets of ZFN pairs (pair 1: SBS30724 and SBS30725 and pair 2:
    SBS30872 and SBS30873). Figure 4A is a gel that quantifies the indels present in the
    amplicon encompassing the pair 1 site and Figure 4B is another gel that quantifies the
    indels present in the amplicon that encompasses the pair 2 site. The percent of
    albumin genes bearing ZFN-induced modifications in the liver biopsies is indicated at
30  the bottom of the lanes, and demonstrates that the albumin ZFN pairs are capable of
    modifying up to 17% of targets when the nucleases are delivered in vivo.

    albumin-specific ZFNs expressed from different chimeric AAV vectors.
    Experimental details are provided in Example 5. Figure 5A demonstrates that the
    ZFNs are able to cleave the albumin target in the liver in vivo when introduced into
    the animal via AAV-mediated gene delivery. The percent of albumin genes bearing
 5  ZFN-induced modifications in the liver biopsies ranged up to 16 percent. Figure 5B
    shows a Western blot of liver tissue using either anti-Flag antibodies or anti-p65. The
    open reading frames encoding the ZFNs were fused to a sequence encoding a
   polypeptide FLAG-tag. Thus, the anti-Flag antibody detected the ZFNs and
    demonstrated ZFN expression in the mice receiving ZFNs. The anti-p65 antibody
10  served as a loading control in these experiments and indicated that comparable
    amounts of protein were loaded in each lane.
    100631         Figure 6 shows results from a mouse study in which groups of mice
   were treated with the mouse albumin specific ZFN pair 30724/30725 via delivery of
    differing doses of different AAV serotypes, and then assessed for gene modification
15 using the Cel-I assay. The AAV serotypes tested in this study were AAV2/5,
   AAV2/6, AAV2/8.2 and AAV2/8 (see text for details). The dose levels ranged from
    5el0 to le12 viral genomes, and three mice were injected per group. Viral genomes
   present per diploid cell were also calculated and are indicated at the bottom of each
   lane. The percent indels induced by each treatment is also indicated below each lane
20 and demonstrates that this ZFN pair is capable of cleaving the albumin locus. Control
   mice were injected with phosphate buffered saline. A non-specific band is also
   indicated in the figure.
    [0064]         Figure 7 is a graph depicting the expression of human factor IX (F.IX)
   from a transgene inserted into the mouse albumin locus in vivo. A human F.IX donor
25 transgene was inserted into either the mouse albumin locus at intron 1 or intron 12
   following cleavage with mouse albumin-specific ZFNs in wild type mice. The graph
   shows expression levels of F.IX over a period of 8 weeks following injection of the
   vectors. ZFN pairs targeting either intron 1 or intron 12 of mouse albumin were used
   in this experiment, as well as ZFNs targeted to a human gene as a control. The donor
30 F.IX gene was designed to be used following insertion into intron 1, and thus is not
   expressed properly when inserted into intron 12. The human F.IX transgene is
   expressed at a robust level for at least 8 weeks following insertion into the mouse
   albumin intron 1 locus.

    functionality of the human F.IX gene in the plasma of hemophilic mice following
    ZFN-induced F.IX transgene insertion. The experiment described in Figure 7 was
    repeated in hemophilic mice using the albumin intron 1 specific ZFNs and the human
 5  F.IX donor. Two weeks following treatment, expression level in the serum (Figure
     8A) and clotting time (Figure 8B) were analyzed. The expression of the human F.IX
    transgene in hemophilic mice was able to restore clotting time to that of normal mice.
     [00661          Figure 9 (SEQ ID NO:82) provides a segment of the human albumin
    gene sequence encompassing parts of exon 1 and intron 1. Horizontal bars over the
10  sequence indicate the target sites of the zinc finger nucleases.
     [00671          Figure 10 shows an alignment of a segment of the albumin genes in
    intron 1 from a variety of primate species including human, H sapiens (SEQ ID

    different genome sequence sources): M fascicularis c (SEQ ID NO: 155) and M
15 fascicularis-s(SEQ ID NO:156) and rhesus, M mulatta (SEQ ID NO:157). The figure
    depicts the DNA target locations of the albumin specific TALENs (indicated by the
    horizontal bars above the sequence).
    [00681          Figure 11, panels A to C, show the results of a Cel-I assay carried out
    on genomic DNA isolated from HepG2 cells treated with TALENs or ZFNs targeted
20  to human albumin (Figures 11 A and B) and NHEJ activity of TALENs with different
    gap spacings (Figure 11 C). The nucleases were introduced into HepG2 cells via
    transient plasmid transfection and quantified 3 days later for target modification via
    the Cel-I assay. Two variations of the TALE DNA binding domain were used, which
    differed in the location of their C-terminal truncation points, the + 17 version and the
25  +63 version (see text). Pairs used are described in Table 10. In addition, three ZFN
    pairs were also tested and the % indels detected by the Cel 1 assay is indicated at the
    bottom of the lanes. Figure 11 C is a graph depicting NHEJ activity in terms of the
    gap spacing (bp) between TALEN binding sites.
    [0069]          Figure 12, panels A, B and C depict the results of ZFN pairs directed
30  to the rhesus macaque albumin locus. Figure 12A shows the percent of NHEJ activity

    of Figure 12B depicts another experiment comparing the two pairs at day 3 or day 10
   using 400 ng of ZFN. Figure 12C depicts the results of the SELEX analysis (done at
    100 mM salt concentration) of the three ZFNs that were being compared where the
 5  size of the bar above the middle line shows the results for that position that were
    expected (i.e., a single bar with a value of 1.0 above the line would mean that every
   base at that position analyzed in the SELEX analysis was the expected base), while
   bars below the line indicate the presence of non-expected bases. Bars that are divided
   indicate the relative contributions of other bases.

15 and 1-3) with the samples that either received only ZFN (4-1, 4-2, 4-3) or those that
   only received the huGLa donor ("hu Fabry donor"), samples 5-1 and 5-2 leads to
   identification of a band that coincides with the human liver lysate control. Figure 13B
   depicts ELISA results using a huGLa specific ELISA kit, where samples were
   analyzed from mice either 14 or 30 days following virus introduction (see text for
20 details). Error bars represent standard deviations (n=3). The results demonstrate that
   the mice that received both the ZFN and donor had higher amounts of huGLa signal
   that those that only received ZFN or only received donor.
                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
25  [0071]          Disclosed herein are compositions and methods for modifying an
   endogenous albumin gene, for example, for expressing a transgene in a secretory
   tissue. In some embodiments, the transgene is inserted into an endogenous albumin
   gene to allow for very high expression levels that are moreover limited to hepatic
   tissue. The transgene can encode any protein or peptide including those providing
30 therapeutic benefit.
   [0072]           Thus, the methods and compositions of the invention can be used to
   express therapeutically beneficial proteins (from a transgene) from highly expressed
   loci in secretory tissues. For example, the transgene can encode a protein involved in
                                                18

   WO 2013/044008                                                             PCT/US2012/056539
   disorders of the blood, for example, clotting disorders, and a variety of other
   monogenic diseases. In some embodiments, the transgene can be inserted into the
   endogenous albumin locus such that expression of the transgene is controlled by the
   albumin expressional control elements, resulting in liver-specific expression of the
 5 transgene encoded protein at high concentrations. Proteins that may be expressed
   may include clotting factors such as Factor VII, Factor VIII, Factor IX, Factor X,
   Factor XI, Factor XIII, vWF and the like, antibodies, proteins relevant to lyososomal
   storage, insulin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and indeed any peptide or protein that when so
   expressed provides benefit.
10  [0073]          In addition, any transgene can be introduced into patient derived cells,
   e.g. patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or other types of stem cells
   (embryonic, hematopoietic, neural, or mesenchymal as a non-limiting set) for use in
   eventual implantation into secretory tissues. The transgene can be introduced into any
   region of interest in these cells, including, but not limited to, into an albumin gene or
15 a safe harbor gene. These altered stem cells can be differentiated for example, into
   hepatocytes and implanted into the liver. Alternately, the transgene can be directed to
   the secretory tissue as desired through the use of viral or other delivery systems that
   target specific tissues. For example, use of the liver-trophic adenovirus associated
   virus (AAV) vector AAV8 as a delivery vehicle can result in the integration of the
20 transgene at the desired locus when specific nucleases are co-delivered with the
   transgene.

            Definitions
    [0075]          The terms "nucleic acid," "polynucleotide," and "oligonucleotide" are used
   interchangeably and refer to a deoxyribonucleotide or ribonucleotide polymer, in linear or
   circular conformation, and in either single- or double-stranded form. For the purposes of
10 the present disclosure, these terms are not to be construed as limiting with respect to the
   length of a polymer. The terms can encompass known analogues of natural nucleotides, as
   well as nucleotides that are modified in the base, sugar and/or phosphate moieties (e.g.,
   phosphorothioate backbones). In general, an analogue of a particular nucleotide has the
   same base-pairing specificity; i.e., an analogue of A will base-pair with T.
15  [00761          The terms "polypeptide," "peptide" and "protein" are used interchangeably
   to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The term also applies to amino acid polymers
   in which one or more amino acids are chemical analogues or modified derivatives of
   corresponding naturally-occurring amino acids.
   [00771           "Binding" refers to a sequence-specific, non-covalent interaction
20 between macromolecules (e.g., between a protein and a nucleic acid). Not all
   components of a binding interaction need be sequence-specific (e.g., contacts with
   phosphate residues in a DNA backbone), as long as the interaction as a whole is
   sequence-specific. Such interactions are generally characterized by a dissociation
   constant (Kd) of 10~6 M 1 or lower. "Affinity" refers to the strength of binding:
25 increased binding affinity being correlated with a lower Kd.
   [00781          A "binding protein" is a protein that is able to bind non-covalently to
   another molecule. A binding protein can bind to, for example, a DNA molecule (a DNA
   binding protein), an RNA molecule (an RNA-binding protein) and/or a protein molecule (a
   protein-binding protein). In the case of a protein-binding protein, it can bind to itself (to
30 form homodimers, homotrimers, etc.) and/or it can bind to one or more molecules of a
   different protein or proteins. A binding protein can have more than one type of binding
   activity. For example, zinc finger proteins have DNA-binding, RNA-binding and protein
   binding activity.
                                               20

   WO 2013/044008                                                            PCT/US2012/056539
    [00791          A "zinc finger DNA binding protein" (or binding domain) is a protein, or a
   domain within a larger protein, that binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner through one
   or more zinc fingers, which are regions of amino acid sequence within the binding domain
   whose structure is stabilized through coordination of a zinc ion. The term zinc finger
 5 DNA binding protein is often abbreviated as zinc finger protein or ZFP.
    [00801          A "TALE DNA binding domain" or "TALE" is a polypeptide comprising
   one or more TALE repeat domains/units. The repeat domains are involved in binding of
   the TALE to its cognate target DNA sequence. A single "repeat unit" (also referred to as a
    "repeat") is typically 33-35 amino acids in length and exhibits at least some sequence
10 homology with other TALE repeat sequences within a naturally occurring TALE protein.
   See, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 20110301073, incorporated by reference herein in its
   entirety.
   [0081]           Zinc finger and TALE binding domains can be "engineered" to bind to
   a predetermined nucleotide sequence, for example via engineering (altering one or
15 more amino acids) of the recognition helix region of a naturally occurring zinc finger
   or TALE protein. Therefore, engineered DNA binding proteins (zinc fingers or
   TALEs) are proteins that are non-naturally occurring. Non-limiting examples of
   methods for engineering DNA-binding proteins are design and selection. A designed
   DNA binding protein is a protein not occurring in nature whose design/composition
20 results principally from rational criteria. Rational criteria for design include
   application of substitution rules and computerized algorithms for processing
   information in a database storing information of existing ZFP and/or TALE designs
   and binding data. See, for example, US Patents 6,140,081; 6,453,242; and 6,534,261;

25 WO 03/016496 and U.S. Publication No. 20110301073.
   [0082]           A "selected" zinc finger protein or TALE is a protein not found in
   nature whose production results primarily from an empirical process such as phage
   display, interaction trap or hybrid selection. See e.g., US 5,789,538; US 5,925,523;

   [0083]           "Recombination" refers to a process of exchange of genetic
   information between two polynucleotides. For the purposes of this disclosure,
                                                21

   WO 2013/044008                                                          PCT/US2012/056539
    "homologous recombination (HR)" refers to the specialized form of such exchange
   that takes place, for example, during repair of double-strand breaks in cells via
   homology-directed repair mechanisms. This process requires nucleotide sequence
   homology, uses a "donor" molecule to template repair of a "target" molecule (i.e., the
 5 one that experienced the double-strand break), and is variously known as "non
   crossover gene conversion" or "short tract gene conversion," because it leads to the
   transfer of genetic information from the donor to the target. Without wishing to be
   bound by any particular theory, such transfer can involve mismatch correction of
   heteroduplex DNA that forms between the broken target and the donor, and/or
10 "synthesis-dependent strand annealing," in which the donor is used to re-synthesize
   genetic information that will become part of the target, and/or related processes. Such
   specialized HR often results in an alteration of the sequence of the target molecule
   such that part or all of the sequence of the donor polynucleotide is incorporated into
   the target polynucleotide.
15  [0084]          In the methods of the disclosure, one or more targeted nucleases as
   described herein create a double-stranded break in the target sequence (e.g., cellular
   chromatin) at a predetermined site, and a "donor" polynucleotide, having homology to
   the nucleotide sequence in the region of the break, can be introduced into the cell.
   The presence of the double-stranded break has been shown to facilitate integration of
20 the donor sequence. The donor sequence may be physically integrated or,
   alternatively, the donor polynucleotide is used as a template for repair of the break via
   homologous recombination, resulting in the introduction of all or part of the
   nucleotide sequence as in the donor into the cellular chromatin. Thus, a first sequence
   in cellular chromatin can be altered and, in certain embodiments, can be converted
25 into a sequence present in a donor polynucleotide. Thus, the use of the terms
   "replace" or "replacement" can be understood to represent replacement of one
   nucleotide sequence by another, (i.e., replacement of a sequence in the informational
   sense), and does not necessarily require physical or chemical replacement of one
   polynucleotide by another.
30 [0085]          In any of the methods described herein, additional pairs of zinc-finger
   or TALEN proteins can be used for additional double-stranded cleavage of additional
   target sites within the cell.
                                               22

   WO 2013/044008                                                           PCT/US2012/056539
    [00861          In certain embodiments of methods for targeted recombination and/or
   replacement and/or alteration of a sequence in a region of interest in cellular
   chromatin, a chromosomal sequence is altered by homologous recombination with an
   exogenous "donor" nucleotide sequence. Such homologous recombination is
 5 stimulated by the presence of a double-stranded break in cellular chromatin, if
   sequences homologous to the region of the break are present.
    [00871          In any of the methods described herein, the first nucleotide sequence
   (the "donor sequence") can contain sequences that are homologous, but not identical,
   to genomic sequences in the region of interest, thereby stimulating homologous
10 recombination to insert a non-identical sequence in the region of interest. Thus, in
   certain embodiments, portions of the donor sequence that are homologous to
   sequences in the region of interest exhibit between about 80 to 99% (or any value
   therebetween) sequence identity to the genomic sequence that is replaced. In other
   embodiments, the homology between the donor and genomic sequence is higher than
15 99%, for example if only 1 nucleotide differs as between donor and genomic
   sequences of over 101 contiguous base pairs. In certain cases, a non-homologous
   portion of the donor sequence can contain sequences not present in the region of
   interest, such that new sequences are introduced into the region of interest. In these
   instances, the non-homologous sequence is generally flanked by sequences of 50
20  1,000 base pairs (or any integral value therebetween) or any number of base pairs
   greater than 1,000, that are homologous or identical to sequences in the region of
   interest. In other embodiments, the donor sequence is non-homologous to the first
   sequence, and is inserted into the genome by non-homologous recombination
   mechanisms.
25  [00881         Any of the methods described herein can be used for partial or
   complete inactivation of one or more target sequences in a cell by targeted integration
   of donor sequence that disrupts expression of the gene(s) of interest. Cell lines with
   partially or completely inactivated genes are also provided.
    [0089]         Furthermore, the methods of targeted integration as described herein
30 can also be used to integrate one or more exogenous sequences. The exogenous
   nucleic acid sequence can comprise, for example, one or more genes or cDNA
   molecules, or any type of coding or non-coding sequence, as well as one or more
   control elements (e.g., promoters). In addition, the exogenous nucleic acid sequence
                                               23

   WO 2013/044008                                                          PCT/US2012/056539
   may produce one or more RNA molecules (e.g., small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs),
   inhibitory RNAs (RNAis), microRNAs (miRNAs), etc.).
    [0090]          "Cleavage" refers to the breakage of the covalent backbone of a DNA
   molecule. Cleavage can be initiated by a variety of methods including, but not limited to,
 5 enzymatic or chemical hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond. Both single-stranded
   cleavage and double-stranded cleavage are possible, and double-stranded cleavage can
   occur as a result of two distinct single-stranded cleavage events. DNA cleavage can result
   in the production of either blunt ends or staggered ends. In certain embodiments, fusion
   polypeptides are used for targeted double-stranded DNA cleavage.
10  [0091]          A "cleavage half-domain" is a polypeptide sequence which, in
   conjunction with a second polypeptide (either identical or different) forms a complex
   having cleavage activity (preferably double-strand cleavage activity). The terms "first
   and second cleavage half-domains;" "+ and - cleavage half-domains" and "right and
   left cleavage half-domains" are used interchangeably to refer to pairs of cleavage half
15 domains that dimerize.
   [0092]           An "engineered cleavage half-domain" is a cleavage half-domain that
   has been modified so as to form obligate heterodimers with another cleavage half
   domain (e.g., another engineered cleavage half-domain). See, also, U.S. Patent
   Publication Nos. 2005/0064474, 20070218528, 2008/0131962 and 2011/0201055,
20 incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
   [00931           The term "sequence" refers to a nucleotide sequence of any length,
   which can be DNA or RNA; can be linear, circular or branched and can be either
   single-stranded or double stranded. The term "donor sequence" refers to a nucleotide
   sequence
25 that is inserted into a genome. A donor sequence can be of any length, for example
   between 2 and 10,000 nucleotides in length (or any integer value therebetween or
   thereabove), preferably between about 100 and 1,000 nucleotides in length (or any
   integer therebetween), more preferably between about 200 and 500 nucleotides in
   length.
30 [00941           "Chromatin" is the nucleoprotein structure comprising the cellular
   genome. Cellular chromatin comprises nucleic acid, primarily DNA, and protein,
   including histones and non-histone chromosomal proteins. The majority of
   eukaryotic cellular chromatin exists in the form of nucleosomes, wherein a
                                                24

   WO 2013/044008                                                           PCT/US2012/056539
   nucleosome core comprises approximately 150 base pairs of DNA associated with an
   octamer comprising two each of histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4; and linker DNA (of
   variable length depending on the organism) extends between nucleosome cores. A
   molecule of histone HI is generally associated with the linker DNA. For the purposes
 5 of the present disclosure, the term "chromatin" is meant to encompass all types of
   cellular nucleoprotein, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Cellular chromatin includes
   both chromosomal and episomal chromatin.
   [0095]           A "chromosome," is a chromatin complex comprising all or a portion
   of the genome of a cell. The genome of a cell is often characterized by its karyotype,
10 which is the collection of all the chromosomes that comprise the genome of the cell.
   The genome of a cell can comprise one or more chromosomes.
   [00961           An "episome" is a replicating nucleic acid, nucleoprotein complex or
   other structure comprising a nucleic acid that is not part of the chromosomal
   karyotype of a cell. Examples of episomes include plasmids and certain viral
15 genomes.
   [0097]          A "target site" or "target sequence" is a nucleic acid sequence that
   defines a portion of a nucleic acid to which a binding molecule will bind, provided
   sufficient conditions for binding exist.
   [00981          An "exogenous" molecule is a molecule that is not normally present in
20 a cell, but can be introduced into a cell by one or more genetic, biochemical or other
   methods. "Normal presence in the cell" is determined with respect to the particular
   developmental stage and environmental conditions of the cell. Thus, for example, a
   molecule that is present only during embryonic development of muscle is an
   exogenous molecule with respect to an adult muscle cell. Similarly, a molecule
25 induced by heat shock is an exogenous molecule with respect to a non-heat-shocked
   cell. An exogenous molecule can comprise, for example, a functioning version of a
   malfunctioning endogenous molecule or a malfunctioning version of a normally
   functioning endogenous molecule.
   [0099]          An exogenous molecule can be, among other things, a small molecule,
30 such as is generated by a combinatorial chemistry process, or a macromolecule such
   as a protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, lipid, glycoprotein, lipoprotein,
   polysaccharide, any modified derivative of the above molecules, or any complex
   comprising one or more of the above molecules. Nucleic acids include DNA and
                                                25

   WO 2013/044008                                                             PCT/US2012/056539
    RNA, can be single- or double-stranded; can be linear, branched or circular; and can
   be of any length. Nucleic acids include those capable of forming duplexes, as well as
   triplex-forming nucleic acids. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,176,996 and
    5,422,251. Proteins include, but are not limited to, DNA-binding proteins,
 5 transcription factors, chromatin remodeling factors, methylated DNA binding
   proteins, polymerases, methylases, demethylases, acetylases, deacetylases, kinases,
   phosphatases, integrases, recombinases, ligases, topoisomerases, gyrases and
   helicases.
    [01001           An exogenous molecule can be the same type of molecule as an
10 endogenous molecule, e.g., an exogenous protein or nucleic acid. For example, an
   exogenous nucleic acid can comprise an infecting viral genome, a plasmid or episode
   introduced into a cell, or a chromosome that is not normally present in the cell.
   Methods for the introduction of exogenous molecules into cells are known to those of
   skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, lipid-mediated transfer (i.e.,
15 liposomes, including neutral and cationic lipids), electroporation, direct injection, cell
   fusion, particle bombardment, calcium phosphate co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran
   mediated transfer and viral vector-mediated transfer. An exogenous molecule can also
   be the same type of molecule as an endogenous molecule but derived from a different
   species than the cell is derived from. For example, a human nucleic acid sequence
20 may be introduced into a cell line originally derived from a mouse or hamster.
    [0101]           By contrast, an "endogenous" molecule is one that is normally present
   in a particular cell at a particular developmental stage under particular environmental
   conditions. For example, an endogenous nucleic acid can comprise a chromosome,
   the genome of a mitochondrion, chloroplast or other organelle, or a naturally
25 occurring episomal nucleic acid. Additional endogenous molecules can include
   proteins, for example, transcription factors and enzymes.
    [0102]           A "fusion" molecule is a molecule in which two or more subunit
   molecules are linked, preferably covalently. The subunit molecules can be the same
   chemical type of molecule, or can be different chemical types of molecules.
30 Examples of the first type of fusion molecule include, but are not limited to, fusion
   proteins (for example, a fusion between a ZFP or TALE DNA-binding domain and
   one or more activation domains) and fusion nucleic acids (for example, a nucleic acid
   encoding the fusion protein described supra). Examples of the second type of fusion
                                                26

   WO 2013/044008                                                           PCT/US2012/056539
   molecule include, but are not limited to, a fusion between a triplex-forming nucleic
   acid and a polypeptide, and a fusion between a minor groove binder and a nucleic
   acid.
    [0103]         Expression of a fusion protein in a cell can result from delivery of the
 5 fusion protein to the cell or by delivery of a polynucleotide encoding the fusion
   protein to a cell, wherein the polynucleotide is transcribed, and the transcript is
   translated, to generate the fusion protein. Trans-splicing, polypeptide cleavage and
   polypeptide ligation can also be involved in expression of a protein in a cell. Methods
   for polynucleotide and polypeptide delivery to cells are presented elsewhere in this
10 disclosure.
    [0104]         A "gene," for the purposes of the present disclosure, includes a DNA
   region encoding a gene product (see infra), as well as all DNA regions which regulate
   the production of the gene product, whether or not such regulatory sequences are
   adjacent to coding and/or transcribed sequences. Accordingly, a gene includes, but is
15 not necessarily limited to, promoter sequences, terminators, translational regulatory
   sequences such as ribosome binding sites and internal ribosome entry sites, enhancers,
   silencers, insulators, boundary elements, replication origins, matrix attachment sites
   and locus control regions.
   [0105]          "Gene expression" refers to the conversion of the information,
20 contained in a gene, into a gene product. A gene product can be the direct
   transcriptional product of a gene (e.g., mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, antisense RNA,
   ribozyme, structural RNA or any other type of RNA) or a protein produced by
   translation of an mRNA. Gene products also include RNAs which are modified, by
   processes such as capping, polyadenylation, methylation, and editing, and proteins
25 modified by, for example, methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination,
   ADP-ribosylation, myristilation, and glycosylation.
   [0106]          "Modulation" of gene expression refers to a change in the activity of a
   gene. Modulation of expression can include, but is not limited to, gene activation and
   gene repression. Genome editing (e.g., cleavage, alteration, inactivation, random
30 mutation) can be used to modulate expression. Gene inactivation refers to any
   reduction in gene expression as compared to a cell that does not include a ZFP or
   TALEN as described herein. Thus, gene inactivation may be partial or complete.

    [01071          A "region of interest" is any region of cellular chromatin, such as, for
   example, a gene or a non-coding sequence within or adjacent to a gene, in which it is
   desirable to bind an exogenous molecule. Binding can be for the purposes of targeted
   DNA cleavage and/or targeted recombination. A region of interest can be present in a
 5 chromosome, an episome, an organellar genome (e.g., mitochondrial, chloroplast), or
   an infecting viral genome, for example. A region of interest can be within the coding
   region of a gene, within transcribed non-coding regions such as, for example, leader
   sequences, trailer sequences or introns, or within non-transcribed regions, either
   upstream or downstream of the coding region. A region of interest can be as small as
10 a single nucleotide pair or up to 2,000 nucleotide pairs in length, or any integral value
   of nucleotide pairs.
    [0108]          "Eukaryotic" cells include, but are not limited to, fungal cells (such as
   yeast), plant cells, animal cells, mammalian cells and human cells (e.g., T-cells).
    [01091          "Secretory tissues" are those tissues that secrete products. Examples
15 of secretory tissues that are localized to the gastrointestinal tract include the cells that
   line the gut, the pancreas, and the gallbladder. Other secretory tissues include the
   liver, tissues associated with the eye and mucous membranes such as salivary glands,
   mammary glands, the prostate gland, the pituitary gland and other members of the
   endocrine system. Additionally, secretory tissues include individual cells of a tissue
20 type which are capable of secretion.
    [0110]          The terms "operative linkage" and "operatively linked" (or "operably
   linked") are used interchangeably with reference to a juxtaposition of two or more
   components (such as sequence elements), in which the components are arranged such
   that both components function normally and allow the possibility that at least one of
25 the components can mediate a function that is exerted upon at least one of the other
   components. By way of illustration, a transcriptional regulatory sequence, such as a
   promoter, is operatively linked to a coding sequence if the transcriptional regulatory
   sequence controls the level of transcription of the coding sequence in response to the
   presence or absence of one or more transcriptional regulatory factors. A
30 transcriptional regulatory sequence is generally operatively linked in cis with a coding
   sequence, but need not be directly adjacent to it. For example, an enhancer is a
   transcriptional regulatory sequence that is operatively linked to a coding sequence,
   even though they are not contiguous.

    [0111]          With respect to fusion polypeptides, the term "operatively linked" can
   refer to the fact that each of the components performs the same function in linkage to
   the other component as it would if it were not so linked. For example, with respect to
   a fusion polypeptide in which a ZFP or TALE DNA-binding domain is fused to an
 5 activation domain, the ZFP or TALE DNA-binding domain and the activation domain
   are in operative linkage if, in the fusion polypeptide, the ZFP or TALE DNA-binding
   domain portion is able to bind its target site and/or its binding site, while the
   activation domain is able to up-regulate gene expression. When a fusion polypeptide
   in which a ZFP or TALE DNA-binding domain is fused to a cleavage domain, the
10 ZFP or TALE DNA-binding domain and the cleavage domain are in operative linkage
   if, in the fusion polypeptide, the ZFP or TALE DNA-binding domain portion is able
   to bind its target site and/or its binding site, while the cleavage domain is able to
   cleave DNA in the vicinity of the target site.
   [01121           A "functional fragment" of a protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid is a
15 protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid whose sequence is not identical to the full-length
   protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid, yet retains the same function as the full-length
   protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid. A functional fragment can possess more, fewer,
   or the same number of residues as the corresponding native molecule, and/or can
   contain one or more amino acid or nucleotide substitutions. Methods for determining
20 the function of a nucleic acid (e.g., coding function, ability to hybridize to another
   nucleic acid) are well-known in the art. Similarly, methods for determining protein
   function are well-known. For example, the DNA-binding function of a polypeptide
   can be determined, for example, by filter-binding, electrophoretic mobility-shift, or
   immunoprecipitation assays. DNA cleavage can be assayed by gel electrophoresis.
25 See Ausubel et al., supra. The ability of a protein to interact with another protein can
   be determined, for example, by co-immunoprecipitation, two-hybrid assays or
   complementation, both genetic and biochemical. See, for example, Fields et al.
   (1989) Nature 340:245-246; U.S. Patent No. 5,585,245 and PCT WO 98/44350.
   [0113]           A "vector" is capable of transferring gene sequences to target cells.
30 Typically, "vector construct," "expression vector," and "gene transfer vector," mean
   any nucleic acid construct capable of directing the expression of a gene of interest and
   which can transfer gene sequences to target cells. Thus, the term includes cloning, and
   expression vehicles, as well as integrating vectors.

    [01141          A "reporter gene" or "reporter sequence" refers to any sequence that
   produces a protein product that is easily measured, preferably although not necessarily
   in a routine assay. Suitable reporter genes include, but are not limited to, sequences
   encoding proteins that mediate antibiotic resistance (e.g., ampicillin resistance,
 5 neomycin resistance, G418 resistance, puromycin resistance), sequences encoding
   colored or fluorescent or luminescent proteins (e.g., green fluorescent protein,
   enhanced green fluorescent protein, red fluorescent protein, luciferase), and proteins
   which mediate enhanced cell growth and/or gene amplification (e.g., dihydrofolate
   reductase). Epitope tags include, for example, one or more copies of FLAG, His,
10 myc, Tap, HA or any detectable amino acid sequence. "Expression tags" include
   sequences that encode reporters that may be operably linked to a desired gene
   sequence in order to monitor expression of the gene of interest.
             Nucleases
15 [0115]          Described herein are compositions, particularly nucleases, which are
   useful targeting a gene for the insertion of a transgene, for example, nucleases that are
   specific for albumin. In certain embodiments, the nuclease is naturally occurring. In
   other embodiments, the nuclease is non-naturally occurring, i.e., engineered in the
   DNA-binding domain and/or cleavage domain. For example, the DNA-binding
20 domain of a naturally-occurring nuclease may be altered to bind to a selected target
   site (e.g., a meganuclease that has been engineered to bind to site different than the
   cognate binding site). In other embodiments, the nuclease comprises heterologous
   DNA-binding and cleavage domains (e.g., zinc finger nucleases; TAL-effector
   nucleases; meganuclease DNA-binding domains with heterologous cleavage
25 domains).
            A. DNA-binding domains
   [01161          In certain embodiments, the nuclease is a meganuclease (homing
   endonuclease). Naturally-occurring meganucleases recognize 15-40 base-pair
30 cleavage sites and are commonly grouped into four families: the LAGLIDADG
   family, the GIY-YIG family, the His-Cyst box family and the HNH family.

   The DNA-binding domains of the homing endonucleases and meganucleases may be
   altered in the context of the nuclease as a whole (i.e., such that the nuclease includes
   the cognate cleavage domain) or may be fused to a heterologous cleavage domain.
   [0118]          In other embodiments, the DNA-binding domain comprises a naturally
25 occurring or engineered (non-naturally occurring) TALE DNA binding domain. See,
   e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2011/0301073, incorporated by reference in its
   entirety herein. The plant pathogenic bacteria of the genus Xanthomonas are known
   to cause many diseases in important crop plants. Pathogenicity of Xanthomonas
   depends on a conserved type III secretion (T3S) system which injects more than 25
30 different effector proteins into the plant cell. Among these injected proteins are
   transcription activator-like effectors (TALE) which mimic plant transcriptional
   activators and manipulate the plant transcriptome (see Kay et al (2007) Science
   318:648-651). These proteins contain a DNA binding domain and a transcriptional
                                                31

   activation domain. One of the most well characterized TALEs is AvrBs3 from
   Xanthomonas campestgrispv. Vesicatoria(see Bonas et al (1989) Mol Gen Genet
   218: 127-136 and W02010079430). TALEs contain a centralized domain of tandem
   repeats, each repeat containing approximately 34 amino acids, which are key to the
 5 DNA binding specificity of these proteins. In addition, they contain a nuclear
   localization sequence and an acidic transcriptional activation domain (for a review see
   Schornack S, et al (2006) JPlantPhysiol 163(3): 256-272). In addition, in the
   phytopathogenic bacteria Ralstonia solanacearumtwo genes, designated brg 11 and
   hpx17 have been found that are homologous to the AvrBs3 family of Xanthomonas in
10 the R. solanacearumbiovar 1 strain GMI1000 and in the biovar 4 strain RS1000 (See
   Heuer et al (2007) Appl and Envir Micro 73(13): 4379-4384). These genes are 98.9%
   identical in nucleotide sequence to each other but differ by a deletion of 1,575 bp in
   the repeat domain of hpxl7. However, both gene products have less than 40%
   sequence identity with AvrBs3 family proteins of Xanthomonas.
15 [01191            Thus, in some embodiments, the DNA binding domain that binds to a
   target site in a target locus (e.g., albumin or safe harbor) is an engineered domain
   from a TALE similar to those derived from the plant pathogens Xanthomonas (see
   Boch et al, (2009) Science 326: 1509-1512 and Moscou and Bogdanove, (2009)
   Science326: 1501) and Ralstonia (see Heuer et al (2007) Applied and Environmental

   U.S. Patent Publication No. 20110145940.
   [01201            In certain embodiments, the DNA binding domain comprises a zinc
   finger protein (e.g., a zinc finger protein that binds to a target site in an albumin or
   safe-harbor gene). Preferably, the zinc finger protein is non-naturally occurring in
25 that it is engineered to bind to a target site of choice. See, for example, See, for

   one or more amino acid sequences of zinc fingers which bind the particular triplet or

            B. Cleavage Domains
10 [01261          Any suitable cleavage domain can be operatively linked to a DNA
   binding domain to form a nuclease. For example, ZFP DNA-binding domains have
   been fused to nuclease domains to create ZFNs - a functional entity that is able to
   recognize its intended nucleic acid target through its engineered (ZFP) DNA binding
   domain and cause the DNA to be cut near the ZFP binding site via the nuclease
15 activity. See, e.g., Kim et al. (1996) Proc Nat'l Acad Sci USA 93(3):1156-1160.
   More recently, ZFNs have been used for genome modification in a variety of
   organisms. See, for example, United States Patent Publications 20030232410;
   20050208489; 20050026157; 20050064474; 20060188987; 20060063231; and
   International Publication WO 07/014275. Likewise, TALE DNA-binding domains
20 have been fused to nuclease domains to create TALENs. See, e.g., U.S. Publication
   No.20110301073.
   [01271          As noted above, the cleavage domain may be heterologous to the
   DNA-binding domain, for example a zinc finger DNA-binding domain and a cleavage
   domain from a nuclease or a TALEN DNA-binding domain and a cleavage domain,
25 or meganuclease DNA-binding domain and cleavage domain from a different
   nuclease. Heterologous cleavage domains can be obtained from any endonuclease or
   exonuclease. Exemplary endonucleases from which a cleavage domain can be
   derived include, but are not limited to, restriction endonucleases and homing
   endonucleases. See, for example, 2002-2003 Catalogue, New England Biolabs,
30 Beverly, MA; and Belfort et al. (1997) Nucleic A cids Res. 25:3379-33 88. Additional
   enzymes which cleave DNA are known (e.g., S1 Nuclease; mung bean nuclease;
   pancreatic DNase I; micrococcal nuclease; yeast HO endonuclease; see also Linn et
   al. (eds.) Nucleases, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,1993). One or more of
                                                34

   WO 2013/044008                                                           PCT/US2012/056539
   these enzymes (or functional fragments thereof) can be used as a source of cleavage
   domains and cleavage half-domains.
    [01281          Similarly, a cleavage half-domain can be derived from any nuclease or
   portion thereof, as set forth above, that requires dimerization for cleavage activity. In
 5 general, two fusion proteins are required for cleavage if the fusion proteins comprise
   cleavage half-domains. Alternatively, a single protein comprising two cleavage half
   domains can be used. The two cleavage half-domains can be derived from the same
   endonuclease (or functional fragments thereof), or each cleavage half-domain can be
   derived from a different endonuclease (or functional fragments thereof). In addition,
10 the target sites for the two fusion proteins are preferably disposed, with respect to
   each other, such that binding of the two fusion proteins to their respective target sites
   places the cleavage half-domains in a spatial orientation to each other that allows the
   cleavage half-domains to form a functional cleavage domain, e.g., by dimerizing.
   Thus, in certain embodiments, the near edges of the target sites are separated by 5-8
15 nucleotides or by 15-18 nucleotides. However any integral {why are we always using
   the qualifiers "integral" and "integer" -- are these really necessary? They just seem
   restrictive and their use would seem to open us up to workarounds}. number of
   nucleotides or nucleotide pairs can intervene between two target sites (e.g., from 2 to
   50 nucleotide pairs or more). In general, the site of cleavage lies between the target
20 sites.
   [0129]           Restriction endonucleases (restriction enzymes) are present in many
   species and are capable of sequence-specific binding to DNA (at a recognition site),
   and cleaving DNA at or near the site of binding. Certain restriction enzymes (e.g.,
   Type IIS) cleave DNA at sites removed from the recognition site and have separable
25 binding and cleavage domains. For example, the Type IIS enzyme Fok I catalyzes
   double-stranded cleavage of DNA, at 9 nucleotides from its recognition site on one
   strand and 13 nucleotides from its recognition site on the other. See, for example, US
   Patents 5,356,802; 5,436,150 and 5,487,994; as well as Li et al. (1992) Proc. Natl.
   Acad. Sci. USA 89:4275-4279; Li et al. (1993) Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:2764
30 2768; Kim et al. (1994a) Proc. Nat!. Acad. Sci. USA 91:883-887; Kim et al. (1994b)
   J Biol. Chem. 269:31,978-31,982. Thus, in one embodiment, fusion proteins
   comprise the cleavage domain (or cleavage half-domain) from at least one Type IIS

   restriction enzyme and one or more zinc finger binding domains, which may or may
   not be engineered.
    [01301          An exemplary Type IIS restriction enzyme, whose cleavage domain is
   separable from the binding domain, is Fok I. This particular enzyme is active as a
 5 dimer. Bitinaite et al. (1998) Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95: 10,570-10,575.
   Accordingly, for the purposes of the present disclosure, the portion of the Fok I
   enzyme used in the disclosed fusion proteins is considered a cleavage half-domain.
   Thus, for targeted double-stranded cleavage and/or targeted replacement of cellular
   sequences using zinc finger-Fok I fusions, two fusion proteins, each comprising a
10 FokI cleavage half-domain, can be used to reconstitute a catalytically active cleavage
   domain. Alternatively, a single polypeptide molecule containing a DNA binding
   domain and two Fok I cleavage half-domains can also be used.
    [01311         A cleavage domain or cleavage half-domain can be any portion of a
   protein that retains cleavage activity, or that retains the ability to multimerize (e.g.,
15 dimerize) to form a functional cleavage domain.
    [0132]         Exemplary Type IIS restriction enzymes are described in International
   Publication WO 07/014275, incorporated herein in its entirety. Additional restriction
   enzymes also contain separable binding and cleavage domains, and these are
   contemplated by the present disclosure. See, for example, Roberts et al. (2003)
20 Nucleic Acids Res. 31:418-420.
   [01331          In certain embodiments, the cleavage domain comprises one or more
   engineered cleavage half-domain (also referred to as dimerization domain mutants)
   that minimize or prevent homodimerization, as described, for example, in U.S. Patent
   Publication Nos. 20050064474; 20060188987; 20080131962 and 20110201055, the
25 disclosures of all of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties herein.

   498, 499, 500, 531, 534, 537, and 538 of Fok I are all targets for influencing
   dimerization of the Fok I cleavage half-domains.
   [0134]          Exemplary engineered cleavage half-domains of Fok I that form
30 obligate heterodimers include a pair in which a first cleavage half-domain includes
   mutations at amino acid residues at positions 490 and 538 of Fok I and a second
   cleavage half-domain includes mutations at amino acid residues 486 and 499.

    [01351          Thus, in one embodiment, a mutation at 490 replaces Glu (E) with Lys
   (K); the mutation at 538 replaces Iso (I) with Lys (K); the mutation at 486 replaced
   Gln (Q) with Glu (E); and the mutation at position 499 replaces Iso (I) with Lys (K).
   Specifically, the engineered cleavage half-domains described herein were prepared by
 5 mutating positions 490 (E-+K) and 538 (I-K) in one cleavage half-domain to
   produce an engineered cleavage half-domain designated "E490K:1538K" and by
   mutating positions 486 (Q-+E) and 499 (I-+L) in another cleavage half-domain to
   produce an engineered cleavage half-domain designated "Q486E:1499L". The
   engineered cleavage half-domains described herein are obligate heterodimer mutants
10 in which aberrant cleavage is minimized or abolished. See, e.g., U.S. Patent
   Publication No. 2008/0131962, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in
   its entirety for all purposes.
   [0136]           In certain embodiments, the engineered cleavage half-domain
   comprises mutations at positions 486, 499 and 496 (numbered relative to wild-type
15 Fokl), for instance mutations that replace the wild type Gln (Q) residue at position
   486 with a Glu (E) residue, the wild type Iso (I) residue at position 499 with a Leu (L)
   residue and the wild-type Asn (N) residue at position 496 with an Asp (D) or Glu (E)
   residue (also referred to as a "ELD" and "ELE" domains, respectively). In other
   embodiments, the engineered cleavage half-domain comprises mutations at positions
20 490, 538 and 537 (numbered relative to wild-type Fokl), for instance mutations that
   replace the wild type Glu (E) residue at position 490 with a Lys (K) residue, the wild
   type Iso (I) residue at position 538 with a Lys (K) residue, and the wild-type His (H)
   residue at position 537 with a Lys (K) residue or a Arg (R) residue (also referred to as
   "KKK" and "KKR" domains, respectively). In other embodiments, the engineered
25 cleavage half-domain comprises mutations at positions 490 and 537 (numbered
   relative to wild-type FokI), for instance mutations that replace the wild type Glu (E)
   residue at position 490 with a Lys (K) residue and the wild-type His (H) residue at
   position 537 with a Lys (K) residue or a Arg (R) residue (also referred to as "KIK"
   and "KIR" domains, respectively). (See US Patent Publication No. 20110201055).
30 Engineered cleavage half-domains described herein can be prepared using any
   suitable method, for example, by site-directed mutagenesis of wild-type cleavage half
   domains (Fok I) as described in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20050064474;

   [01371           Alternatively, nucleases may be assembled in vivo at the nucleic acid
   target site using so-called "split-enzyme" technology (see e.g. U.S. Patent Publication
   No. 20090068164). Components of such split enzymes may be expressed either on
   separate expression constructs, or can be linked in one open reading frame where the
 5 individual components are separated, for example, by a self-cleaving 2A peptide or
   IRES sequence. Components may be individual zinc finger binding domains or
   domains of a meganuclease nucleic acid binding domain.
   [0138]           Nucleases can be screened for activity prior to use, for example in a
   yeast-based chromosomal system as described in WO 2009/042163 and
10 20090068164. Nuclease expression constructs can be readily designed using methods
   known in the art. See, e.g., United States Patent Publications 20030232410;
   20050208489; 20050026157; 20050064474; 20060188987; 20060063231; and
   International Publication WO 07/014275. Expression of the nuclease may be under
   the control of a constitutive promoter or an inducible promoter, for example the
15 galactokinase promoter which is activated (de-repressed) in the presence of raffinose
   and/or galactose and repressed in presence of glucose.
           Target Sites
   [01391           As described in detail above, DNA domains can be engineered to bind
20 to any sequence of choice in a locus, for example an albumin or safe-harbor gene. An
   engineered DNA-binding domain can have a novel binding specificity, compared to a
   naturally-occurring DNA-binding domain. Engineering methods include, but are not
   limited to, rational design and various types of selection. Rational design includes,
   for example, using databases comprising triplet (or quadruplet) nucleotide sequences
25 and individual (e.g., zinc finger) amino acid sequences, in which each triplet or
   quadruplet nucleotide sequence is associated with, one or more amino acid sequences
   of DNA binding domain which bind the particular triplet or quadruplet sequence.
   See, for example, co-owned U.S. Patents 6,453,242 and 6,534,261, incorporated by
   reference herein in their entireties. Rational design of TAL-effector domains can also
30 be performed. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 20110301073.

   [01421           In addition, as disclosed in these and other references, DNA-binding
   domains (e.g., multi-finger zinc finger proteins) may be linked together using any
10 suitable linker sequences, including for example, linkers of 5 or more amino acids.
   See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,479,626; 6,903,185; and 7,153,949 for exemplary linker
   sequences 6 or more amino acids in length. The proteins described herein may
   include any combination of suitable linkers between the individual DNA-binding
   domains of the protein. See, also, U.S. Publication No. 20110301073.
15
            Donors
   [01431           As noted above, insertion of an exogenous sequence (also called a
   "donor sequence" or "donor"), for example for correction of a mutant gene or for
   increased expression of a wild-type gene. It will be readily apparent that the donor
20 sequence is typically not identical to the genomic sequence where it is placed. A
   donor sequence can contain a non-homologous sequence flanked by two regions of
   homology to allow for efficient HDR at the location of interest. Additionally, donor
   sequences can comprise a vector molecule containing sequences that are not
   homologous to the region of interest in cellular chromatin. A donor molecule can
25 contain several, discontinuous regions of homology to cellular chromatin. For
   example, for targeted insertion of sequences not normally present in a region of
   interest, said sequences can be present in a donor nucleic acid molecule and flanked
   by regions of homology to sequence in the region of interest.
   [01441           The donor polynucleotide can be DNA or RNA, single-stranded or
30 double-stranded and can be introduced into a cell in linear or circular form. See, e.g.,
   U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20100047805 and 20110207221. If introduced in linear
   form, the ends of the donor sequence can be protected (e.g., from exonucleolytic
   degradation) by methods known to those of skill in the art. For example, one or more
                                                 39

   WO 2013/044008                                                           PCT/US2012/056539
   dideoxynucleotide residues are added to the 3' terminus of a linear molecule and/or
   self-complementary oligonucleotides are ligated to one or both ends. See, for
   example, Chang et al. (1987) Proc. Nati. Acad Sci. USA 84:4959-4963; Nehls et al.
   (1996) Science 272:886-889. Additional methods for protecting exogenous
 5 polynucleotides from degradation include, but are not limited to, addition of terminal
   amino group(s) and the use of modified internucleotide linkages such as, for example,
   phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, and 0-methyl ribose or deoxyribose residues.
    [0145]         A polynucleotide can be introduced into a cell as part of a vector
   molecule having additional sequences such as, for example, replication origins,
10 promoters and genes encoding antibiotic resistance. Moreover, donor polynucleotides
   can be introduced as naked nucleic acid, as nucleic acid complexed with an agent
   such as a liposome or poloxamer, or can be delivered by viruses (e.g., adenovirus,
   AAV, herpesvirus, retrovirus, lentivirus and integrase defective lentivirus (IDLV)).
    [01461         The donor is generally inserted so that its expression is driven by the
15 endogenous promoter at the integration site, namely the promoter that drives
   expression of the albumin gene. However, it will be apparent that the donor may
   comprise a promoter and/or enhancer, for example a constitutive promoter or an
   inducible or tissue specific promoter.
    [01471         The donor molecule may be inserted into an endogenous gene such
20 that all, some or none of the endogenous gene is expressed. For example, a transgene
   as described herein may be inserted into an albumin locus such that some or none of
   the endogenous albumin sequences are expressed, for example as a fusion with the
   transgene. In other embodiments, the transgene (e.g., with or without albumin
   encoding sequences) is integrated into any endogenous locus, for example a safe
25 harbor locus. See, e.g., US patent publications 20080299580; 20080159996 and
   201000218264.
    [0148]         When albumin sequences (endogenous or part of the transgene) are
   expressed with the transgene, the albumin sequences may be full-length sequences
   (wild-type or mutant) or partial sequences. Preferably the albumin sequences are
30 functional. Non-limiting examples of the function of these full length or partial
   albumin sequences include increasing the serum half-life of the polypeptide expressed
   by the transgene (e.g., therapeutic gene) and/or acting as a carrier.

    [01491         Furthermore, although not required for expression, exogenous
   sequences may also include transcriptional or translational regulatory sequences, for

   encoding 2A peptides and/or polyadenylation signals.

            Delivery
    [0150]         The nucleases, polynucleotides encoding these nucleases, donor
   polynucleotides and compositions comprising the proteins and/or polynucleotides
   described herein may be delivered in vivo or ex vivo by any suitable means.
10  [01511         Methods of delivering nucleases as described herein are described, for
   example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,453,242; 6,503,717; 6,534,261; 6,599,692; 6,607,882;
   6,689,558; 6,824,978; 6,933,113; 6,979,539; 7,013,219; and 7,163,824, the
   disclosures of all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.
   [0152]          Nucleases and/or donor constructs as described herein may also be
15 delivered using vectors containing sequences encoding one or more of the zinc finger
   or TALEN protein(s). Any vector systems may be used including, but not limited to,
   plasmid vectors, retroviral vectors, lentiviral vectors, adenovirus vectors, poxvirus
   vectors; herpesvirus vectors and adeno-associated virus vectors, etc. See, also, U.S.
   Patent Nos. 6,534,261; 6,607,882; 6,824,978; 6,933,113; 6,979,539; 7,013,219; and
20 7,163,824, incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. Furthermore, it will be
   apparent that any of these vectors may comprise one or more of the sequences needed
   for treatment. Thus, when one or more nucleases and a donor construct are
   introduced into the cell, the nucleases and/or donor polynucleotide may be carried on
   the same vector or on different vectors. When multiple vectors are used, each vector
25 may comprise a sequence encoding one or multiple nucleases and/or donor constructs.
   [0153]          Conventional viral and non-viral based gene transfer methods can be
   used to introduce nucleic acids encoding nucleases and donor constructs in cells (e.g.,
   mammalian cells) and target tissues. Non-viral vector delivery systems include DNA
   plasmids, naked nucleic acid, and nucleic acid complexed with a delivery vehicle such
30 as a liposome or poloxamer. Viral vector delivery systems include DNA and RNA
   viruses, which have either episomal or integrated genomes after delivery to the cell.

30 of the antibody has specificity for the target tissue and the other has specificity for the
   EDV. The antibody brings the EDVs to the target cell surface and then the EDV is
   brought into the cell by endocytosis. Once in the cell, the contents are released (see

   [0158]           The use of RNA or DNA viral based systems for the delivery of
   nucleic acids encoding engineered ZFPs take advantage of highly evolved processes
   for targeting a virus to specific cells in the body and trafficking the viral payload to
   the nucleus. Viral vectors can be administered directly to patients (in vivo) or they
 5 can be used to treat cells in vitro and the modified cells are administered to patients
   (ex vivo). Conventional viral based systems for the delivery of ZFPs include, but are
   not limited to, retroviral, lentivirus, adenoviral, adeno-associated, vaccinia and herpes
   simplex virus vectors for gene transfer. Integration in the host genome is possible
   with the retrovirus, lentivirus, and adeno-associated virus gene transfer methods, often
10 resulting in long term expression of the inserted transgene. Additionally, high
   transduction efficiencies have been observed in many different cell types and target
   tissues.
   [01591          The tropism of a retrovirus can be altered by incorporating foreign
   envelope proteins, expanding the potential target population of target cells. Lentiviral
15 vectors are retroviral vectors that are able to transduce or infect non-dividing cells and
   typically produce high viral titers. Selection of a retroviral gene transfer system
   depends on the target tissue. Retroviral vectors are comprised of cis-acting long
   terminal repeats with packaging capacity for up to 6-10 kb of foreign sequence. The
   minimum cis-acting LTRs are sufficient for replication and packaging of the vectors,
20 which are then used to integrate the therapeutic gene into the target cell to provide
   permanent transgene expression. Widely used retroviral vectors include those based
   upon murine leukemia virus (MuLV), gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV), Simian
   Immunodeficiency virus (SIV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and
   combinations thereof (see, e.g., Buchscher et al., J Virol. 66:2731-2739 (1992);
25 Johann et al., J Virol. 66:1635-1640 (1992); Sommerfelt et al., Virol. 176:58-59

   2224 (1991); PCT/US94/05700).
   [0160]          In applications in which transient expression is preferred, adenoviral
   based systems can be used. Adenoviral based vectors are capable of very high
30 transduction efficiency in many cell types and do not require cell division. With such
   vectors, high titer and high levels of expression have been obtained. This vector can
   be produced in large quantities in a relatively simple system. Adeno-associated virus
   ("AAV") vectors are also used to transduce cells with target nucleic acids, e.g., in the
                                                 43

   [01611           At least six viral vector approaches are currently available for gene
10 transfer in clinical trials, which utilize approaches that involve complementation of
   defective vectors by genes inserted into helper cell lines to generate the transducing
   agent.
   [01621           pLASN and MFG-S are examples of retroviral vectors that have been
   used in clinical trials (Dunbar et al., Blood 85:3048-305 (1995); Kohn et al., Nat.
15 Med. 1:1017-102 (1995); Malech et al., PNAS 94:22 12133-12138 (1997)).
   PA317/pLASN was the first therapeutic vector used in a gene therapy trial. (Blaese et
   al., Science 270:475-480 (1995)). Transduction efficiencies of 50% or greater have
   been observed for MFG-S packaged vectors. (Ellem et al., Immunol Immunother.
   44(1):10-20 (1997); Dranoff et al., Hum. Gene Ther. 1:111-2 (1997).
20 [01631           Recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors (rAAV) are a promising
   alternative gene delivery systems based on the defective and nonpathogenic
   parvovirus adeno-associated type 2 virus. All vectors are derived from a plasmid that
   retains only the AAV 145 bp inverted terminal repeats flanking the transgene
   expression cassette. Efficient gene transfer and stable transgene delivery due to
25 integration into the genomes of the transduced cell are key features for this vector
   system. (Wagner et al., Lancet 351:9117 1702-3 (1998), Kearns et al., Gene Ther.
   9:748-55 (1996)). Other AAV serotypes, including AAV1, AAV3, AAV4, AAV5,
   AAV6, AAV8, AAV 8.2, AAV9, AAV rhl0 and pseudotyped AAV such as AAV2/8,
   AAV2/5 and AAV2/6 can also be used in accordance with the present invention.
30 [0164]           Replication-deficient recombinant adenoviral vectors (Ad) can be
   produced at high titer and readily infect a number of different cell types. Most
   adenovirus vectors are engineered such that a transgene replaces the Ad El a, El b,
   and/or E3 genes; subsequently the replication defective vector is propagated in human
                                                 44

   293 cells that supply deleted gene function in trans. Ad vectors can transduce
   multiple types of tissues in vivo, including non-dividing, differentiated cells such as
   those found in liver, kidney and muscle. Conventional Ad vectors have a large
   carrying capacity. An example of the use of an Ad vector in a clinical trial involved
 5 polynucleotide therapy for anti-tumor immunization with intramuscular injection
   (Sterman et al., Hum. Gene Ther. 7:1083-9 (1998)). Additional examples of the use
   of adenovirus vectors for gene transfer in clinical trials include Rosenecker et al.,

   [01651           Packaging cells are used to form virus particles that are capable of
   infecting a host cell. Such cells include 293 cells, which package adenovirus, and V2
   cells or PA317 cells, which package retrovirus. Viral vectors used in gene therapy are
15 usually generated by a producer cell line that packages a nucleic acid vector into a
   viral particle. The vectors typically contain the minimal viral sequences required for
   packaging and subsequent integration into a host (if applicable), other viral sequences
   being replaced by an expression cassette encoding the protein to be expressed. The
   missing viral functions are supplied in trans by the packaging cell line. For example,
20 AAV vectors used in gene therapy typically only possess inverted terminal repeat
   (ITR) sequences from the AAV genome which are required for packaging and
   integration into the host genome. Viral DNA is packaged in a cell line, which
   contains a helper plasmid encoding the other AAV genes, namely rep and cap, but
   lacking ITR sequences. The cell line is also infected with adenovirus as a helper. The
25 helper virus promotes replication of the AAV vector and expression of AAV genes
   from the helper plasmid. The helper plasmid is not packaged in significant amounts
   due to a lack of ITR sequences. Contamination with adenovirus can be reduced by,
   e.g., heat treatment to which adenovirus is more sensitive than AAV.
   [0166]           In many gene therapy applications, it is desirable that the gene therapy
30 vector be delivered with a high degree of specificity to a particular tissue type.
   Accordingly, a viral vector can be modified to have specificity for a given cell type by
   expressing a ligand as a fusion protein with a viral coat protein on the outer surface of
   the virus. The ligand is chosen to have affinity for a receptor known to be present on
                                               45

   WO 2013/044008                                                           PCT/US2012/056539
   the cell type of interest. For example, Han et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:9747
   9751 (1995), reported that Moloney murine leukemia virus can be modified to express
   human heregulin fused to gp70, and the recombinant virus infects certain human
   breast cancer cells expressing human epidermal growth factor receptor. This principle
 5 can be extended to other virus-target cell pairs, in which the target cell expresses a
   receptor and the virus expresses a fusion protein comprising a ligand for the cell
   surface receptor. For example, filamentous phage can be engineered to display
   antibody fragments (e.g., FAB or Fv) having specific binding affinity for virtually any
   chosen cellular receptor. Although the above description applies primarily to viral
10 vectors, the same principles can be applied to nonviral vectors. Such vectors can be
   engineered to contain specific uptake sequences which favor uptake by specific target
   cells.
   [01671          Gene therapy vectors can be delivered in vivo by administration to an
   individual patient, typically by systemic administration (e.g., intravenous,
15 intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subdermal, or intracranial infusion) or topical
   application, as described below. Alternatively, vectors can be delivered to cells ex
   vivo, such as cells explanted from an individual patient (e.g., lymphocytes, bone
   marrow aspirates, tissue biopsy) or universal donor hematopoietic stem cells,
   followed by reimplantation of the cells into a patient, usually after selection for cells
20 which have incorporated the vector.
   [01681          Vectors (e.g., retroviruses, adenoviruses, liposomes, etc.) containing
   nucleases and/or donor constructs can also be administered directly to an organism for
   transduction of cells in vivo. Alternatively, naked DNA can be administered.
   Administration is by any of the routes normally used for introducing a molecule into
25 ultimate contact with blood or tissue cells including, but not limited to, injection,
   infusion, topical application and electroporation. Suitable methods of administering
   such nucleic acids are available and well known to those of skill in the art, and,
   although more than one route can be used to administer a particular composition, a
   particular route can often provide a more immediate and more effective reaction than
30 another route.
   [01691          Vectors suitable for introduction of polynucleotides described herein
   include non-integrating lentivirus vectors (IDLV). See, for example, Ory et al. (1996)

    [01701         Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are determined in part by the
   particular composition being administered, as well as by the particular method used to
 5  administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable
   formulations of pharmaceutical compositions available, as described below (see, e.g.,
   Remington's PharmaceuticalSciences, 17th ed., 1989).
    [0171]         It will be apparent that the nuclease-encoding sequences and donor
   constructs can be delivered using the same or different systems. For example, a donor
10 polynucleotide can be carried by a plasmid, while the one or more nucleases can be
   carried by a AAV vector. Furthermore, the different vectors can be administered by
   the same or different routes (intramuscular injection, tail vein injection, other
   intravenous injection, intraperitoneal administration and/or intramuscular injection.
   The vectors can be delivered simultaneously or in any sequential order.
15  [01721         Formulations for both ex vivo and in vivo administrations include
   suspensions in liquid or emulsified liquids. The active ingredients often are mixed
   with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active
   ingredient. Suitable excipients include, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol,
   ethanol or the like, and combinations thereof. In addition, the composition may
20 contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances, such as, wetting or emulsifying
   agents, pH buffering agents, stabilizing agents or other reagents that enhance the
   effectiveness of the phannaceutical composition.

 5 Example 2: Activity of murine albumin-specific ZFNs
   [01771           The ZFNs in Table 1 were tested for the ability to cleave their
   endogenous target sequences in mouse cells. To accomplish this, constructs
   expressing the ZFNs in Table 1 were transfected into Neuro2A cells in the pairings
   indicated in Figure 1. Cells were then maintained at 37'C for 3 days or subjected to a
10 hypothermic shock (30'C, see co-owned US Patent Publication No. 20110041195).
   Genomic DNA was then isolated from Neuro2A cells using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen)
   and subjected to the Cel-I assay (SurveyorTM, Transgenomics) as described in Perez
   et al, (2008) Nat. Biotechnol. 26: 808-816 and Guschin et al, (2010) Methods Mol
   Biol. 649:247-56), in order to quantify chromosomal modifications induced by ZFN
                                              50

   WO 2013/044008                                                           PCT/US2012/056539
   cleavage. In this assay, PCR is used to amplify a DNA fragment bearing the ZFN
   target site, and then the resultant amplicon is digested with the mismatch-specific
   nuclease Cel-I (Yang et al, (2000) Biochemistry 39, 3533-3541), followed by
   resolution of intact and cleaved amplicon on an agarose gel. By quantifying the
 5 degree of amplicon cleavage, one may calculate the fraction of mutated alleles in
   amplicon and therefore in the original cellular pool. In these experiments, all ZFN
   pairs were ELD/KKR FokI mutation pairs (described above).
   [01781           Results from the Cel-I assay are shown in Figure 1, and demonstrate
   that the ZFNs are capable of inducing cleavage and consequent mutations at their
10 respective target sites. The "percent indel" value shown beneath each lane indicates
   the fraction of ZFN targets that were successfully cleaved and subsequently mutated
   during cellular repair of the double stranded break via NHEJ. The data also
   demonstrate increased activity when the transduction procedure incorporates the
   hypothermic shock.

   Example 3: Canine albumin-specific ZFNs
   [01791           A pair of ZFNs targeting the canine albumin locus was constructed for
   use in in vivo models. The pair was constructed as described in Example 1, and is
20 shown below in Table 3. The target for each ZFN is provided in Table 4.

   [01801            The canine specific ZFNs were tested in vitro for activity essentially as

 5 Example 4: Non-human primate albumin specific ZFNs
   [0181]            ZFNs targeting the albumin locus in rhesus macaque monkeys
   (Macaca mulatta) were also made. The pairs were constructed as described above
   and are shown below in Table 5. The targets for the ZFNs are shown in Table 6. As
   shown below, the human (SEQ ID NO:92) and rhesus macaque (SEQ ID NO:93)

   perfectly conserved. The differences between the human and rhesus sequences are
   boxed.

 5 [01831          The rhesus albumin specific ZFNs were tested in pairs to determine the
   pair with the greatest activity. In each pair, SBS#35396 was tested with the potential
   partners shown in Tables 5 and 6 in the rhesus cell line RF/6A using the methods
   described above.

   (2011) Nature 475 (7355): 217). To facilitate AAV production in the baculovirus
25 system, a baculovirus containing a chimeric serotype 8.2 capsid gene was used.
   Serotype 8.2 capsid differs from serotype 8 capsid in that the phopholipase A2
   domain in capsid protein VP1 of AAV8 has been replaced by the comparable domain
   from the AAV2 capsid creating a chimeric capsid. Production of the ZFN containing
   virus particles was done either by preparation using a HEK293 system or a
30 baculovirus system using standard methods in the art (See Li et al, ibid, see e.g.
   US6723551). The virus particles were then administered to normal male mice (n=6)
   using a single dose of 200 microliter of 1.Oel 1 total vector genomes of either AAV2/8
   or AAV2/8.2 encoding the mouse albumin-specific ZFN. 14 days post administration

   of rAAV vectors, mice were sacrificed, livers harvested and processed for DNA or
   total proteins using standard methods known in the art. Detection of AAV vector
   genome copies was performed by quantitative PCR. Briefly, qPCR primers were
   made specific to the bGHpA sequences within the AAV as follows:

   [0191]           Cleavage activity of the ZFN was measured using a Cel-I assay
   performed using a LC-GX apparatus (Perkin Elmer), according to manufacturer's
10 protocol. Expression of the ZFNs in vivo was measured using a FLAG-Tag system
   according to standard methods.
   [01921           As shown in Figure 5 (for each mouse in the study) the ZFNs were
   expressed, and cleave the target in the mouse liver gene. The % indels generated in
   each mouse sample is provided at the bottom of each lane. The type of vector and
15 their contents are shown above the lanes. Mismatch repair following ZFN cleavage
   (indicated % indels) was detected at nearly 16% in some of the mice.
   [0193]           The mouse specific albumin ZFNs were also tested for in vivo activity
   when delivered via use of a variety of AAV serotypes including AAV2/5, AAV2/6,
   AAV2/8 and AAV2/8.2. In these AAV vectors, all the ZFN encoding sequence is
20 flanked by the AAV2 ITRs, contain, and then encapsulated using capsid proteins from
   AAV5, 6, or 8, respectively. The 8.2 designation is the same as described above. The
   SBS30724 and SBS30725 ZFNs were cloned into the AAV as described previously
   (Li et al, ibid), and the viral particles were produced either using baculovirus or a
   HEK293 transient transfection purification as described above. Dosing was done in
25 normal mice in a volume of 200 ptL per mouse via tail injection, at doses from 5e10 to
   1e12 vg per dose. Viral genomes per diploid mouse genome were analyzed at days
   14, and are analyzed at days 30 and 60. In addition, ZFN directed cleavage of the
   albumin locus was analyzed by Cel-I assay as described previously at day 14 and is
   analyzed at days 30 and 60.
30 [01941           As shown in Figure 6, cleavage was observed at a level of up to 21%
   indels. Also included in Figure are the samples from the previous study as a
   comparison (far right, "mini-mouse" study-D14and a background band ("unspecific

   Example 6: In vivo co-delivery of a donor nucleic acid and albumin ZFNs.
    [0195]         Insertion of human Factor IX: ZFNs were used to target integration of
   the gene for the clotting protein Factor IX (F.IX) into the albumin locus in adult wild
   type mice. In these experiments, the mice were treated by I.V. injection with either 1
 5 x 101 v.g./mouse albumin-specific ZFN pair 1 targeting intron 1 + donor ("mAlb
   (intronl)"), 1 x 1011 v.g./mouse albumin-specific ZFN pair 2 targeting intron 12 +
   donor ("mAlb(intronl2)") or a ZFN set that targets a human gene plus donor as a
   control ("Control"). The ZFN pair #1 was 30724/30725, targeting intron 1, and ZFN
   pair 2 was 30872/30873, targeting exon 12. In these experiments, the F.IX donor
10 transgene was integrated via end capture following ZFN-induced cleavage.
   Alternatively, the F.IX transgene was inserted into a donor vector such that the
   transgene was flanked by arms with homology to the site of cleavage. In either case,
   the F.IX transgene was the "SA - wild-type hF9 exons 2-8" cassette (see co-owned
   US patent application 61/392,333).
15  [01961         Transduced mice were then sampled for serum human F.IX levels,
   which were elevated (see Figure 7, showing stabilized expression of human F.IX for
   at least eight weeks following insertion into intron 1). The expressed human F.IX is
   also functional, as evidenced by the reduction in clotting time in hemophilic mice
   with a human F.IX transgene targeted into the albumin locus (see Figure 8). Notably,
20 within two weeks following transgene insertion, the clotting time is not significantly
   different than clotting time in a wild type mouse. When the intron 1 specific donor
   was inserted into the intron 12 locus, correct splicing to result in expression of the
   huF.IX cannot occur. The lack of signal in this sample verifies that the signal from
   the intron 1 donor being integrated into the intron 1 site is truly from correct transgene
25 integration, and not from random integration and expression at another non-specific
   site.
    [01971         Insertion of human alpha galactosidase ( huGLa): Similar to the
   insertion of the human F.IX gene, the gene encoding human alpha galatosidase
   (deficient in patients with Fabry's disease) was inserted into the mouse albumin locus.
30 The ZFN pair 30724/30725 was used as described above using an alpha galactosidase
   transgene in place of the F.IX transgene. In this experiment, 3 mice were treated with
   an AAV2/8 virus containing the ZFN pair at a dose of 3.Oel 1 viral genomes per
   mouse and an AAV2/8 virus containing the huGLa donor at 1.5e12 viral genomes per
                                               56

   mouse. Control animals were given either the ZFN containing virus alone or the
   huGLa donor virus alone. Western blots done on liver homogenates showed an
   increase in alpha galactosidase-specific signal, indicating that the alpha galactosidase
   gene had been integrated and was being expressed (Figure 13A). In addition, an
 5 ELISA was performed on the liver lysate using a human alpha galactosidase assay kit
   (Sino) according to manufacturer's protocol. The results, shown in Figure 13B,
   demonstrated an increase in signal in the mice that had been treated with both the
   ZFNs and the huGLa donor.
10 Example 7: Design of human albumin specific ZFNs.
    [0198]          To design ZFNs with specificity for the human albumin gene, the DNA
   sequence of human albumin intron 1 was analyzed using previously described
   methods to identify target sequences with the best potential for ZFN binding. Regions
   throughout the intron (loci 1-5) were chosen and several ZFNs were designed to target
15 these regions region (for example, see Figure 9 which shows the binding sites of
   ZFNs from loci 1-3). In this analysis, five loci were identified to target in the albumin
   introni (see Figure 3B). The target and helices are shown in Tables 8 and 9.

   Example 8: Design of albumin specific TALENs
    [02011         TALENs were designed to target sequences within human albumin
   intron 1. Base recognition was achieved using the canonical RVD-base
   correspondences (the "TALE code": NI for A, HD for C, NN for G (NK in half
 5 repeat), NG for T). TALENs were constructed as previously described (see co-owned
   U.S. Patent Publicaiton No. 20110301073). Targets for a subset of TALENs were
   conserved in cynomolgus monkey and rhesus macaque albumin genes (see figure 10).
   The TALENs were constructed in the "+17" and "+63" TALEN backbones as
   described in US20110301073. The targets and numeric identifiers for the TALENs
10 tested are shown below in Table 12.
