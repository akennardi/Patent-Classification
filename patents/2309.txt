drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being
carried out in various ways.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[00141      FIG. 1 illustrates a liquid level maintainer 30, which may also be referred to as a
water level maintainer or a pump, for maintaining a predetermined level of liquid in a reservoir
 15. For example, the reservoir 15 may include a pool, such as swimming pool, a tub, a pond,
such as an artificial pond, a fountain, etc. containing water and/or other liquids.
[00151      The maintainer 30 includes an inlet 1, an outlet 23, and a plumbing assembly 32
disposed between the inlet 1 and the outlet 23. The inlet 1 may include a hose connector, such as
a threaded hose connector or a quick-connect connector, and a hose coupled thereto, as shown in
FIG. 1. The inlet 1 is fluidly coupled to a source of pressurized fluid 5, such as water from a
utility provider, water from an elevated reservoir, water from a pump, etc. An inlet valve 2 is
disposed proximate the inlet 1 for opening and closing the inlet 1 to the flow of the pressurized
fluid 5.
[00161      An outlet fitting 22 is disposed proximate the outlet 23 and may include a hose
connector, such as a threaded hose connector or a quick-connect connector, and a hose coupled
thereto, as shown in FIG. 1.
[00171      The plumbing assembly 32 includes an inlet Y joint 4, an inlet supply tube 7a, an
outlet supply tube 7b, an outlet suction tube 17, a venturi inlet port 18, a venturi valve 19, and a
water outlet tube 21. The inlet Y joint 4 includes an inlet arm fluidly coupled to the inlet 1 and
first and second outlet arms fluidly coupled to the inlet supply tube 7a and the outlet supply tube
7b, respectively. The inlet Y joint 4 splits the pressurized water 5 into two flow paths by way of
the inlet supply tube 7a and the outlet supply tube 7b.

                                                   4
[00181       A first flow path, which may also be referred to herein as a filling flow path, is
defined between the inlet 1 and a filling outlet 34 by the inlet supply tube 7a and selectively
fluidly connects the inlet 1 to the reservoir 15 for supplying the reservoir 15 with the pressurized
fluid 5. A second flow path, which may also be referred to herein as a draining flow path, is
defined between the inlet 1 and the outlet 23 by the outlet supply tube 7b and selectively fluidly
connects the inlet 1 and the reservoir 15 to the outlet 23 by way of the outlet suction tube 17 and
the water outlet tube 21 for draining fluid from the reservoir 15 through the outlet 23, as will be
described in greater detail below. The venturi inlet port 18 is fluidly coupled to the reservoir 15
by the outlet suction tube 17.
[00191       The outlet suction tube 17 includes an opening to the reservoir 15 and an outlet filter
 16 disposed proximate the opening into the outlet suction tube 17 for filtering fluid from the
reservoir 15 into the outlet suction tube 17.
[00201       The inlet supply tube 7a includes a filling valve 9a, such as a first magnet-actuated
diaphragm valve, disposed in the first flow path for selectively opening and closing the first flow
path between the inlet 1 and the reservoir 15. The outlet supply tube 7b includes a draining
valve 9b, such as a second magnet-actuated diaphragm valve, disposed in the second flow path
for selective opening and closing the second flow path between the inlet 1 and the outlet 23. In
the illustrated embodiment, the filling valve 9a and the draining valve 9b are normally closed
valves configured to open in response to magnetic activation, e.g., by the presence of a magnet.
However, it should be understood that other arrangements (e.g., normally open) and the
corresponding variations of the maintainer 30 needed to accommodate such alternate
arrangements are within the scope of the invention.
[00211       FIGS. 2A-2B illustrate one example of a filling valve 9a. Note that the draining valve
9b is merely a mirror image of the filling valve 9a. As such, the draining valve 9b can be
described the same way and need not be described separately. In the illustrated embodiment, the
maintainer 30 includes a switch such as a magnetic solenoid 38 having a pin 40 biased by a
spring 42 to an extended, or normally closed, position (FIG. 2A). The filling valve 9a also
includes a diaphragm valve 44 biased to a normally closed position. The extended position of
the solenoid pin 40 corresponds with the closed position of the diaphragm valve 44. When the

                                                   5
magnetic solenoid 38 is activated, e.g., by proximity of a magnet or magnetic field (or by a
power source in other embodiments), the pin 40 moves to a retracted position against the bias of
the spring 42. The retracted position of the pin 42 corresponds with an open position of the
diaphragm valve 44 in which the filling flow path (or, in the case of the draining valve 9b, the
draining flow path) is open. In other embodiments, other types of switches for opening and
closing the filling valve 9a and draining valve 9b may be employed, such as an electric solenoid,
one or more sensors detecting a liquid level in the reservoir and sending a control signal to open
or close the filling valve 9a and draining valve 9b, a magnetic actuator (as will be described
below with reference to FIG. 4), or any other suitable switch.
[00221       FIG. 4 illustrates another embodiment of a draining valve 36. In FIG. 4, the draining
valve 36 is illustrated and could be inserted into FIG. 1 in place of the draining valve 9b.
However, it should be understood that the filling valve in this alternate embodiment is a mirror
image of the draining valve 36 and can be described the same way such that the filling valve
need not be described separately herein. The draining valve 36 includes a normally closed
diaphragm 46 for closing the draining flow path, as shown in FIG. 4. The diaphragm 46 is
normally closed by a switch such as spring-biased actuator 48. The actuator 48 is magnetically
actuatable, e.g., by proximity of a magnet or magnetic field, and movable against the bias of the
spring to move the diaphragm 46 to an open position for opening the draining flow path (or the
filling flow path in the case of the corresponding filling valve).
[00231       Returning to FIG. 1, the maintainer 30 also includes a float chamber 8 containing a
float 11 movably coupled to a float shaft 6 and arranged to rise and fall in an axial direction (e.g.,
parallel to the float shaft 6) with the changing fluid level in the reservoir 15. The float 11 may be
inhibited from rotation about the float shaft 6, e.g., by a projection or keyed arrangement
therebetween, and, as such, constrained to translation in the axial direction. A float chamber
vent 3 fluidly connects the float chamber 8 to atmosphere to allow the fluid level inside the float
chamber 8 to match the fluid level in the reservoir 15. The float 11 includes a first magnet 12a
and a second magnet 12b coupled thereto. The float chamber 8 also includes a baffle, or baffles,
 14 to inhibit debris from entering the float chamber 8.

                                                    6
[00241       The filling and draining valves 36 and/or the solenoids 38, are disposed proximate a
sidewall 50 defining the float chamber 8 in order to provide proximity to the magnets 12a, 12b
when the corresponding magnet(s) 12a, 12b reach a position adjacent to the valves 36 and/or
solenoids 38 in the axial direction. The valves 36 and/or the solenoids 38 may be directly
adjacent the sidewall 50. The draining valves 36 and/or the solenoids 38 are disposed on
different sides of the float chamber 8 transverse to the axial direction, and in the illustrated
embodiment are on generally opposite sides of the float chamber 8. In the illustrated
embodiment, the solenoids 38 and/or the valves 36 are disposed at the same height in the axial
direction, and the magnets 12a, 12b are offset from each other in the axial direction. However,
in other embodiments, it should be understood that other arrangements can achieve the same
actuation of the solenoids 38 and/or valves 36 at the same fluid level heights 10, 13, 20. For
example, the solenoids 38 and/or valves 36 may be offset at different heights in the axial
direction while the magnets 12a, 12b are disposed at the same height on the float 11 relative to
the axial direction, in which case the magnets 12a, 12b may be separate or integrated into a
single magnet. Thus, a magnet assembly may include separate magnets 12a, 12b or a single
magnet. Other configurations are also possible, such as the solenoids 38 and/or valves 36 being
offset and the magnets 12a, 12b being offset.
[00251       The reservoir 15 includes a predetermined normal fluid level setting 10, a
predetermined low fluid level setting 13, and a predetermined high fluid level setting 20. The
magnets 12a, 12b are arranged to selectively open and/or close the filling and draining valves 9a,
9b. As shown in FIG. 3C, the first magnet 12a is disposed adjacent the filling valve 9a when the
fluid in the reservoir 15 reaches the low fluid level 13. As shown in FIG. 3A, the second magnet
 12b is disposed adjacent the draining valve 9b when the fluid in the reservoir 15 reaches the high
fluid level 20. When the fluid in the fluid reservoir 15 is between the low fluid level setting 13
and the high fluid level setting 20, e.g., at or about the normal fluid level setting 10 shown in
FIG. 3B, then neither of the first or second magnets 12a, 12b is disposed adjacent the filling
valve 9a or the draining valve 9b such that neither valve 9a, 9b is activated magnetically. Thus,
in the illustrated embodiment, the magnets 12a, 12b are configured to selectively open the filling
valve 9a and the draining valve 9b by proximity, which are normally closed. As discussed
above, it should be understood that the magnets 12a, 12b can be arranged to correspond with
alternate configurations of the filling and draining valves 9a, 9b (e.g., normally open) as

                                                     7
discussed above to achieve the same effect in the functionality of the maintainer 30, which will
be described in greater detail below.
[00261       In operation, the fluid level maintainer 30 is driven by a back pressure (e.g., the
pressure of the fluid 5 from the fluid source) to maintain a predetermined fluid level, e.g., at or
around the normal fluid level setting 10. When the reservoir 15 contains the normal fluid level
 10 (FIGS. 1 and 3B), the filling valve 9a and the draining valve 9b are closed. At the normal
fluid level 10, the float 11 is in a position that corresponds with the closed position of the filling
valve 9a and the draining valve 9b. In the illustrated embodiment, the float 11 is in a neutral
position that does not actuate the normally-closed filling or draining valves 9a, 9b.
[00271       When the fluid level drops to the predetermined low level 13 (FIG. 3C), then the
reservoir 15 is in need of filling to maintain the fluid level within the predetermined range
between the low level fluid setting 13 and the high level fluid setting 20. When the fluid reaches
the low fluid level 13, then the float 11 opens the filling valve 9a. In the illustrated embodiment,
the first magnet 12a carried on the float 11 drops to a position adjacent the filling valve 9a and
actuates the solenoid 38 (or other type of switch) by proximity, which opens the filling flow path.
As such, the fluid fills the reservoir 15.
[00281       When the fluid level rises to the predetermined high fluid level 20 (FIG. 3A), then the
reservoir 15 is in need of draining to maintain the fluid level within the predetermined range.
When the fluid reaches the high fluid level 20, then the float 11 opens the draining valve 9b. In
the illustrated embodiment, the second magnet 12b carried on the float 11 rises to a position
adjacent the filling valve 9b and actuates the solenoid 38 (or other type of switch) by proximity,
which opens the draining flow path. Fluid in the draining flow path subsequently begins flowing
to the venturi 19, which includes a constriction that creates a pressure differential, e.g., a lower
pressure area relative to the surroundings, at the venturi inlet port 18. The pressure differential
between the source fluid and the lower pressure area drives fluid draining such that the lower
pressure at the venturi inlet port 18 draws fluid from the reservoir 15 through the outlet suction
tube 17 to the water outlet tube 21, to the outlet 23. As such, the fluid drains from the reservoir
 15.

                                                     8
[00291       It should be understood that the maintainer 30 operates in the same manner if the
alternate filling/draining valve 36 is employed.
Thus, the invention provides, among other things, a fluid level maintainer 30 that is powered by
the pressure of the source fluid and controlled to either fill or drain the reservoir by a switch
actuating float. Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to certain
preferred embodiments, variations and modifications exist within the scope and spirit of one or
more independent aspects of the invention as described. Various features and advantages of the
invention are set forth in the following claims.
[00301       In the claims which follow and in the preceding description of the invention, except
where the context requires otherwise due to express language or necessary implication, the word
"comprise" or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising" is used in an inclusive sense, i.e.
to specify the presence of the stated features but not to preclude the presence or addition of
further features in various embodiments of the invention.
