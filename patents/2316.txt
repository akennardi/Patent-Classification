                                        Electronic Luggage ID Tag
                                  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0001]       The present invention relates to electronic luggage tags, and particularly to such tags
which are reusable.
[0002]       Travelers are encouraged or required by airlines to tag their suitcases and other luggage
to assist in owner identification. Many travelers use permanent tags with personal information
printed or hand written on the tags. Some bags and luggage are equipped with viewing
compartments configured to receive a conventional business card carrying the same information.
Many airlines even provide travelers with disposable tags on which the travelers can provide
personal identification and contact information if the traveler's bags do not include their own tags.
[0003]       One drawback of such tags is that they are not integrated into airline baggage
handling/management systems, which utilize special, machine readable (optically scanned)
disposable tags applied by the airlines to each piece of baggage given over to the airline to transport.
[0004]       Another drawback is that the machine readable disposable tags applied by the airlines are
not reusable. Discarded machine readable luggage tags create over a million pounds of waste per
year.
[0005]       It is desirable to provide a permanent luggage tag that could be used repeatedly by
travelers, is capable of integration into carriers' baggage handling/management systems in place of
single use, printed airline tags, and includes a durable method of connection to traveler's luggage.
                                BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[0006]       In one aspect, the present invention is an programmable luggage tag comprising a
programmable electronic visual display assembly including a display screen, a radio receiver, a
processor operably connecting the display assembly with the radio receiver, the processor
configured to permit programming of an image shown on the display screen in response to image
commands received through the radio receiver, a unitary housing having first and second opposing
major outer sides and first and second opposing minor outer sides arranged substantially
perpendicularly to the first and second opposing major outer sides, the housing containing the
display assembly, the radio receiver, and the processor, the first major outer side of the housing
being substantially transparent, revealing the display screen, the housing configured to receive a

                                                     2
cord through a first chamber integrally formed within the housing, and a planar flap fixedly
connected with the second major outer side of the housing.

                          DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0022]      Certain terminology is used in the following description for convenience only and is not
limiting. Unless specifically set forth herein, the terms a     "an" and "the" are not limited to one
element but instead should be read as meaning "at least one". The words "right," "left," "lower,"

                                                     3
and "upper" designate directions in the drawings to which reference is made. The words "inwardly"
or "distally" and "outwardly" or "proximally" refer to directions toward and away from,
respectively, the geometric center or orientation of the device and related parts thereof. The
terminology includes the above-listed words, derivatives thereof and words of similar import.
[0023]      Referring to Figs. 1-15, a preferred embodiment of a programmable luggage ID tag 10
has two distinct components, including a first, rigid hollow unitary housing component or housing,
generally indicated by reference numeral 12, and a second, resiliently flexible planar identification
flap component or flap, generally indicated by reference numeral 14.
[0024]      The housing 12 preferably includes a protective case 80. Referring to Figs. 1-6, the case
80 is preferably a single-piece shell which is preferably constructed of a relatively lightweight, high
impact plastic, such as high-impact polystyrene ("HIPS") or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
("ABS"), a metal, such as an aluminum, or a combination or composite of polymer and metal
pieces. The housing 12 further includes a programmable, electronic visual display assembly,
indicated generally as 60, with a display screen 62, a protective screen 61, and other circuitry 70,
which includes a supporting circuit board 72. Each of the display screen 62, protective screen 61
and other circuitry 70 are preferably received and housed in or on the case 80. The display screen
62 is visible through the substantially transparent protective screen 61. The protective screen 61 is
preferably constructed of polycarbonate materials and is preferably additionally coated with one or
more protective and reflection resistant (anti-glare) coatings to enhance readability of the display 60
by optical scanners or the like, but is not limited to constructions utilizing such materials or to
inclusion of the described coatings. The protective screen 61 is preferably bonded to the display
screen 62 through any suitable methods and techniques, such as with a silicone gel or other
adhesive. The display screen 62 is preferably bonded to the circuit board 72 through any suitable
methods and techniques, such as with a silicone gel or other adhesive. The display assembly 60 is
preferably secured to the case 80 via a laser welding process, but may alternatively be secured to the
case 80 by a snap fit, fasteners, hook and loop material, clamping, adhesive bonding or other such
methods or techniques.
[0025]      Referring to Figs. 1-5, the flap 14 of the preferred tag 10 is a planar sheet preferably
formed of a flexible polymer, more preferably a microporous material like PPG Industries' Teslin@.
The flap 14 functions as or contains at least one radio frequency identification ("RFID") transponder
assembly, which is provided by an antenna and resonant circuitry (not shown). Preferably, the flap
14 or RFID transponder assembly is passive with an ultra-high operating radio frequency ("UHF").
The passive RFID transponder assembly of the flap 14 is preferably powered only from an external

                                                     4
interrogation signal. The flap 14 is preferably coated with or bonded to a polyester film (not shown)
to provide additional strength, wear, and soil resistance properties to the outer surface of the flap 14.
However, other non-porous polymer sheet materials such as polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") or
polycarbonate ("PC") may be considered or preferred based on designer or consumer preferences.
The construction of polyester or other polymer films preferably gives the flap 14 the thickness and
flexible resilience of a conventional credit or debit card. In contrast to the case 80, the flap 14
preferably has a stiffness with respect to force applied against either of its major planar surfaces less
than any given stiffness of the case 80 with respect to force applied to its closed major outer side.
The flap 14 is also preferably thinner than any given thickness of the case 80.
[0026]       The RFID transponder assembly of the flap 14 may be assigned a unique permanent
identification code to uniquely identify the assembly. The identification code is loaded into non
volatile memory of the assembly, is non-alterable, and is transmitted by the assembly in response to
an external interrogation signal to identify the assembly to the interrogator upon request. Such
identification can be used by a traveler to identify the luggage tag using a suitable device, such as a
smartphone, to then initiate connection to the other circuitry 70 as described herein. The
identification can also be used in conjunction with baggage handling systems at airports around the
world to allow a traveler to track the progress of his or her luggage along its journey. Airports
equipped with such technology have devices capable of interrogating the RFID signals of the
luggage tag 10 at various places throughout the airport's luggage handling system, which can be
configured to send alerts to travelers notifying the traveler as his or her luggage passes certain points
in the airport via electronic mail, SMS, or any other suitable means of communication.
[0027]       The flap 14 is secured to the case 80, preferably by one or more mechanical connections,
welds, or adhesive bonding, but is not so limited and may be otherwise fixedly secured to the case
80 by clamping, fastening or other methods and techniques. The flap 14 is also preferably held in
place by a number of hollow posts 84 to be received in a number of openings or flap holes 85
provided through a proximal end portion of the flap 14.
[0028]       Separating the RFID transponder assembly in the flap 14 from the display assembly 60
and the circuit board 72 in the case 80 provides several benefits. Such separation permits the
separate manufacture of the flap 14 by conventional, high speed, lower cost, cold lamination and
printing processes typically used in credit/debit card and RFID tag and card manufacture industries.
The flap 14 can be manufactures without subjecting it to the temperatures and pressures of the
injection molding processes used to manufacture the hard polymer case 80, in which RFID
transponder assemblies have been installed by others. Such separation is also beneficial to minimize

                                                     5
possible interference between the RFID transponder assembly in the flap 14 and the display 60 and
other circuitry 70 in the case 80. This type of interference could negatively impact the effective
range of the RFID transponder in the flap 14.
[0029]       Teslin* is a microvoided/microporous polysilicate sheet material of the type described in
detail in U.S. Pat. No. 4,861,644, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. A
copy of the patent is attached to this application as Appendix A. This polysilicate material is very
porous with an essentially uniform porosity throughout of greater than thirty percent (30%) by
volume, more typically forty-five to sixty percent (45-60%) in commercial grades, and with an
average pore size of about one micron or less. Microvoided/microporous, polysilicate sheet material
is suitable for various types of printing including laser printing, although other commercially
available, printable synthetic paper products might be used as the RFID transponder of the flap 14.
[0030]       Microporous polysilicate sheet material itself provides several additional distinct
advantages. Such sheet material is waterproof and durable. The preferred microporous polysilicate
material wraps and mechanically protects the RFID transponder of the flap 14 better than any known
non-porous polymer material or paper. The microporosity of the flexible polysilicate sheet material
acts as a cushion and even permits the material to collapse/compress over a chip or other circuitry of
the RFID assembly, thereby reducing inherent stress on the assembly. The flexible polysilicate
sheet material is also considerably more durable than PVC and/or PE commonly used in RFID cards
and tags, withstanding flexing and high mechanical pressure preferably without cracking, peeling or
delaminating over wide operating and mechanical stress ranges. Such properties preferably increase
the useful life of the flap 14 several fold over tags made with other non-porous polymer core
materials and the flap 14 may be constructed of nearly any material that is able to take on the size
and shape of the flap 14, withstand the normal operating conditions of the flap 14 and having similar
properties as those described above.
[0031]       A microporous polysilicate sheet further provides enhanced electrical performance
properties including a two to three decibel (2-3 dB) increase in radio frequency ("RF") signal
propagation read range, which translates into approximately doubling the operating range of the
RFID transponder assembly of the flap 14 compared to an identical assembly embedded in
conventional, non-porous polymer (e.g. PC, PVC or polyethylene terephthalate ("PET")) materials.
It also provides faster static decay times and has lower surface resistivity than PVC, PET and PC,
thereby providing superior static dissipative qualities compared with PVC and/or PE core materials
typically used in RFID tags.

                                                     6
[0032]      Referring to Figs. 1-6 and 15, the display assembly 60 and other circuitry 70 housed in
the case 80 are depicted in functional schematic block diagram form in Fig. 15. The display
assembly 60 includes, in addition to the physical screen 62, driver circuitry 64 that is used to
generate the image resident on the screen 62. The other circuitry 70 includes a manual input device
73 that activates the remainder of the other circuitry 70 for programming/reprogramming of the
image on the display 60. The input device 73 is preferably a mechanical switch that provides tactile
feedback to the user, but capacitive switches and other types of devices may also be used. The input
device 73 preferably causes electricity from an on-board battery power supply or battery 79 to pass
through a power module 75, which is configured to generate power at appropriate voltages to
operate the remaining circuit components and to interface with the driver circuitry 64 of the display
60. The remaining components include at least a wireless signal receiver 76 operably connected
with an antenna 77. Either or both of the wireless signal receiver 76 and antenna 77 may optionally
be located within the flap 14 for communication with a user's smart phone or other device. It will
be appreciated that the other circuitry 70 includes at least one processor for controlling operation of
the other components of the circuitry to program/reprogram the display assembly 60. It will further
be appreciated that the control function may be divided among several processors, each performing
limited functions. For example, the wireless signal receiver 76 may include a micro control unit
("MCU") to interface with the source of wireless/radio image control signals transmitted to the tag
10 to program/reprogram the display 60. A coding engine (DATA Coder) 78 may be provided as a
separate module operably connected between the wireless signal receiver 76 and the display driver
circuitry 64 with its own MCU configured to convert radio control signals received from the
wireless control signal source (i.e. a smart device) through the receiver into command signals
suitable for the driver circuitry 64. Alternatively, the receiver 76 and coding engine 78 might be
combined in a single module with a single processor performing the necessary functions or the
driver circuitry 64 may be "smart", with a processor configured to assume the functions of the
coding engine 78 and configured so as to interface directly with the wireless signal receiver 76
[0033]      The electronic visual display assembly 60 is preferably a bistable passive reflective
display assembly like a sheet of flexible electronic paper ("E-paper" or "e-ink") or a "zero power"
LCD display. Truly bistable visual displays generally require no continuing power to maintain an
image. If the display is bistable as preferred, the battery 79 is preferably needed only to power the
other circuitry 70 to receive image coding instructions and change the image of the display 60. The
bistable display 60, once programmed or reprogrammed, retains its image without further power

                                                     7
usage. Under these conditions, a "coin" type cell battery (not depicted) is preferably sufficient to
power literally thousands of activations and display reprograms.
[0034]      Types of commercially available, bistable displays include: cholesteric liquid crystals
(ChLC) on a flexible thin film, electrophoretic, electrowetting and electrofluidic displays using
charged pigment particles, water oil mixtures and aqueous pigment dispersions, respectively. More
recently, E Ink Corporation has made commercially available a variety of "electronic paper
displays" ("EPD"), extremely thin and flexible, in both active (thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal)
and segmented configurations that might be used. This list is suggestive and not intended to be or to
be considered to be all inclusive or otherwise exclusive. Moreover, while flexible displays are
lighter and thinner, they are generally more expensive than glass mounted EPD's and the latter
provide can provide better contrast to improve optical scanning accuracy.
[0035]       Such displays can be externally programmed/reprogrammed to exhibit conventional
luggage tag coded information normally provided by airlines on the paper tags currently used to
identify and route passenger luggage. The present luggage tag coded information, including
itinerary information and a carrier's baggage management system code number, a passenger name
record ("PNR"), a reservation number or other unique record identifier or locator used by the carrier
to identify the passenger and itinerary in a central data base used by the carrier, can be displayed on
the display 60. The tag 10 may include other variable data (e.g. passenger name, number of checked
bags or items, etc.) that would differ in content from tag to tag of different passengers or even
between tags of the same passenger.
[0036]      The wireless image control signal source is a suitably configured and programmed smart
device. Currently, smart phones are the wireless control signal sources of choice and Bluetooth Low
Energy ("BLE") is the signal format of choice as virtually all smart phones becoming available are
equipped for at least BLE communication. However, other types of "short range" wireless
communication formats might be used as an alternative, for example, Near Field Communication
("NFC") formats, and other short range communication formats that might become available in the
future.
[0037]      It should be appreciated that the preferred tag 10 lacks direct public cellular network
and/or internet connectivity capability, through either a public cellular network or a wireless local
area network (i. e. WLAN/Wi-Fi). All such connectivity of the tag 10 is preferably through a smart
phone or other public network connection enabled device that is also enabled for short range
communication with the tag. "Long range" communication refers to the normal inherent wireless
communication capability provided to cell phones including smart phones to connect with a wireless

                                                     8
public cellular communication network. It is also includes other private network communication
capabilities that might be provided in a cell phone or smart device such as Motorola MOTO talk, a
direct radio communication capability, which typically has a range in the kilometers. "Short range"
communication refers to a separate, additional communication capability and format provided in
certain smart phones and other smart devices having wireless public cellular, Wi-Fi and/or WLAN
network communication capability. BLE communications are designed to have a nominal range of
about fifty meters (50 m), half that of conventional Bluetooth communication. NFC has a nominal
range of a fraction of a meter (practical working distance being reported to be about four
centimeters (4 cm) or about one twenty-fifth of a meter (1/25 m). Other short range, non-public,
non-network wireless communication protocols and equipment may become widely available in the
future to supplant or upgrade Bluetooth, BLE and/or NFC and are intended to be covered by the
invention.
[0038]      In use, an appropriate app is preferably provided by a carrier or other third party to a
passenger to load into the passenger's smart phone or other smart device with public communication
network capability. When the passenger wants to program/reprogram the tag 10, the app is activated
in the smart device by the passenger to automatically contact a remote database designated by the
carrier through the app, via a public communication network accessible to the smart device, such as
a public cellular network or the internet. The app uniquely identifies the passenger to the remote
database. The remote database then identifies and transfers to the smart phone/device, data from a
currently or previously created itinerary stored in or available to the remote database. The app then
wirelessly transmits the display data from the smart phone or other smart device in an appropriate
format (preferably BLE) to the RFID transponder assembly of the flap 14 and through the other
circuitry 70 to update the display 60, which in turn displays the identity and itinerary information in
a machine readable format such as a bar code.
[0039]      Referring to Figs. 11-14, the housing 12 preferably has first and second opposing major
outer sides 40 and 41 arranged substantially parallel to one another. The first major outer side 40 is
preferably substantially transparent to allow visual inspection of the display assembly 60. The
housing 12 further preferably includes first and second minor outer sides 44 and 45 arranged
substantially parallel to one another and substantially perpendicularly to the opposing major outer
sides 40 and 41.
[0040]      Referring to Figs. 5, 8, 10, 12, and 14, the case 80 is preferably configured to receive a
cord 92 for fastening to a user's luggage. The cord 92 is preferably a single length of elastomeric
shock or "bungee" cord, but is not so limited. The cord 92 can be inserted into a first hole 94 on the

                                                    9
first minor outer side 44. The first hole 94 leads to a first chamber 98. On the opposing end of the
first chamber 98 is a hollow post 84 on the second major outer side 41. The first chamber 98 is
formed as a hollow space within the case 80, sealed on all sides by the case 80 except the first hole
94 at one end and the hollow post 84 at the opposing end. Having passed through the first hole 94
and first chamber 98 and out of a hollow post 84, the cord 92 can then be fed through another of the
hollow posts 84 on the second major outer side 41, which leads to a second chamber 99 which has a
second hole 95 on the second minor outer side 45. Preferably, the hollow posts 84 are aligned with
the flap holes 85 such that the cord 92 passes through the posts 84 and the flap holes 85
simultaneously, forming a "C" shape outside of the case 80 and thereby providing additional force
binding the flap 14 against the second major outer side 41 of the case 80. Having been fed out of
the second hole 95, the remaining length of the cord 92 that extends from the second hole 95 can be
fastened to the user's luggage in whatever method the user chooses, such as by tying a knot around a
handle of the luggage or attachment to a key ring. The cord 92 is preferably a length sufficient to
allow six inches (6") or more of the cord 92 to extend from the second hole 95 to more easily allow
a user to attach the cord 92 to his or her luggage.
[0041]       The first chamber 98 is preferably configured to be approximately twice as wide as the
cord 92, while the second chamber 99 is preferably configured to be approximately equal to the
width of the cord 92. The extra width of the first chamber 98 can preferably accommodate measures
to prevent the cord from being fully pulled through the first chamber 98, such as by folding over the
end of the cord 92 and fastening it with a staple 93. Instead of the staple 93, the folded end of the
cord 92 may be fastened with glue, thread, or the like or by tying it the end of the cord 92 in a knot.
[0042]       The case 80 also preferably includes a cord locking mechanism 100, 102 for locking the
cord 92 in place in or near the second chamber 99. As shown in the preferred embodiment in Figs.
7-10, the locking mechanism is preferably comprised of a pivoting lever 100 and a stop 102. The
stop 102 preferably includes means, such as teeth or knurling, for engaging the cord 92 within the
second chamber 99 and locking the cord 92 in place, but is not so limited and may include nearly
any mechanism that performs the engagement function. In use, a user can toggle or pivot the lever
100 from an open position, shown in Fig. 10, to a closed position, shown in Fig. 8. In the closed
position, the lever 100 presses the stop 102 into the second chamber 99 and into engagement with
the cord 92 to lock the cord 92 into place. The user can then release the lever 100 if he or she
desires to remove the cord 92 from the remainder of the tag 10. The cord 92 is not limited to being
connected to the case 80 using the stop 102 and lever 100 configuration and may be otherwise

                                                   10
secured to or integrally formed with the case 80, such as by fastening, clamping, adhesive bonding,
co-molding or other related methods, techniques or mechanisms.
