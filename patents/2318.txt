A method includes a step of supplying a first heated hydrocarbon-containing gas stream to a reactor.
An oxygen-containing gas stream is separately supplied to the reactor to partially oxidize the
hydrocarbon-containing gas stream. The oxygen-containing gas is optionally prepared by passing air
through one or more membranes to increase the oxygen content. One or more of the desired liquid
oxygenated hydrocarbons are condensed and/or separated from the resulting product stream. Non
hydrocarbon gases are selectively removed from the product stream to enrich the gaseous
hydrocarbon fraction using a scrubber and/or a membrane. The remaining gaseous hydrocarbon
products from the product stream are mixed with a fresh hydrocarbon-ontaining gas stream after one
cycle of the reaction. Characteristically, the process uses at least one membrane to increase oxygen
content of the oxygen containing gas and/or to remove non-hydrocarbon gases from the product
stream as set forth above.

101]          This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Serial No. 61/745,591
     filed December 22, 2012, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference

                                               TECHNICAL FIELD
102]          The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for producing oxygenated
     hydrocarbons (especially methanol). More specifically, the embodiments are for converting alkanes,
     such as methane, ethane, propane and butane, into alkyl oxygenates, and in particular, for direct
     oxidation (under partial oxidation conditions) of methane (e.g. from natural gas) to methanol and
     formaldehyde.
                                                 BACKGROUND
[03]          The current industrial practice for methanol production is a two-step reaction. The first step
     is the cleaning and reforming of methane (from natural gas) to carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This
     is followed by a second step consisting of a reaction between carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the
     presence of a solid catalyst to form methanol. This process is energy-intensive and uneconomical for
     all but very large scale methanol plants. The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for
     producing oxygenated hydrocarbons (especially methanol). More specifically, the embodiments are
     for converting alkanes, such as methane, ethane, propane and butane, into alkyl oxygenates, and in
     particular, for direct oxidation (under partial oxidation conditions) of methane (e.g. from natural gas)
     to alcohols and additional oxygenated hydrocarbons.
004]          Various other methods and apparatuses for converting methane into methanol are also
     known. It is known to carry out a vapor-phase reformation of methane into synthesis gas (mixture of
     carbon monoxide and hydrogen) with its subsequent catalytic conversion into methanol, as
                                                          1

          WO 2014/100813                                                         PCT/US2013/077488
    disclosed, for example, in Karavaev M. M., Leonov B. E., et al "Technology of Synthetic
    Methanol", Moscow, "Chemistry" 1984, pages 72-125. However, in order to realize this process,
    highly sophisticated equipment is needed to satisfy the high requirements of gas purity. Large
    quantities of energy are also consumed to obtain the synthesis gas and for its purification, with a
    significant number of intermittent stages in the process. This complexity makes the process
    economically unviable for medium and small enterprises with the capacity less than 2,000 tons/day.
[05]         Russian Patent No. 2,162,460 includes a source of hydrocarbon-containing gas, a compressor
    and a heater for compression and heating of this gas, and an oxygen-containing gas with a
    compressor. It further includes successively arranged reactors with alternating mixing and reaction
    zones and means to supply the hydrocarbon-containing gas into a first mixing zone of the reactor and
    the oxygen-containing gas into each mixing zone, a recuperative heat exchanger for cooling of the
    reaction mixture, a cooler-condenser, a partial condenser for separation of waste gases and liquid
    products with a subsequent separation of methanol, a pipeline for supply of the waste gas into the
    initial hydrocarbon-containing gas, and a pipeline for supply of waste oxygen-containing products
    into the first mixing zone of the reactor. In this apparatus, however, fast withdrawal of heat from the
    highly exothermic oxidation reaction of the hydrocarbon-containing gas is not achievable because of
    the inherent limitations of the heat exchanger. This leads to the need for a reduction in the quantity
    of supplied oxygen-containing gas and, further, it reduces the degree of conversion of the
    hydrocarbon-containing gas. Moreover, even with the use of oxygen as an oxidizer, it is not possible
    to provide an efficient recirculation of the hydrocarbon-containing gas due to the rapid increase in
    the concentration of carbon oxides. A significant part of the supplied oxygen is wasted for oxidation
    of carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide, which additionally reduces the degree of conversion of the
    initial hydrocarbon-containing gas to useful products and provides a further overheating of the
    reaction mixture. As it is necessary to cool these components in the gas-liquid mixture to recover the
    liquid fraction followed by subsequent heating before returning to the reactor, much energy is
    wasted. Furthermore, these components are recompressed after each pass through the recycle
    compressor. Thus, the substantial elimination of non-hydrocarbon components provides                 an
    opportunity to reduce operational and capital expenditures.

    RU 2,200,731, in which compressed heated hydrocarbon-containing gas and compressed oxygen

     containing gas are introduced into mixing zones of successively arranged reactors, and the reaction
     is performed with a controlled heat pick-up by cooling of the reaction mixture with water condensate
     so that steam is obtained, and a degree of cooling of the reaction mixture is regulated by parameters
     of escaping steam, which is used in a liquid product rectification stage.

     Patent Applications Nos. 20060204413, 20060223892, 200638283, 20070100005 and 20070166212,
     which are incorporated herein by reference, describe efficient and low-cost methods and apparatuses
     for the direct partial oxidation of methane to methanol without use of a catalyst. However, because
     recycle systems are suspect to accumulation of inert gases naturally occurring in the hydrocarbon
     gas or in the oxygen containing gas, as well as product gases of the partial oxidation reaction, by
     selectively removing these fractions from the recycle system efficiencies can be significantly
     improved and oxygen consumption reduced.
  08]        It is observed that the methods and apparatuses can be used with minimal processing of on
     shore gas and gas-condensate deposits, as well as integrated with any gas consumer, such as power
     plants, gas distributing and gas reducing stations, chemical production facilities, etc., or small
     methane producers (e.g. coal mines, oil production (flares), landfills, farms, etc.).
  09]        Accordingly, there exists a need for an improved method and apparatus to permit for safe
     conversion of hydrocarbon-containing gas to liquids on off-shore rigs, and also for improved
     efficiencies and simplification to enable a closed cycle system for producing methanol and other
     oxygenated hydrocarbons.

010]         It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for
     producing oxygenated hydrocarbons (especially methanol), which is a further improvement of the
     existing methods and apparatuses.
1011]        In keeping with this object and with others which will become apparent hereinafter, one
     feature of the present invention is a method for producing oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as
     methanol. The method includes a step of supplying a first heated hydrocarbon-containing gas stream

    to a reactor.     An oxygen-containing gas stream is separately supplied to the reactor to partially
    oxidize the hydrocarbon-containing gas stream. The oxygen-containing gas is optionally prepared
    by passing air through one or more membranes to increase the oxygen content. One or more of the
    desired liquid oxygenated hydrocarbons are condensed and/or separated from the resulting product
    stream.    Non-hydrocarbon gases are selectively removed from the product stream to enrich the
    gaseous hydrocarbon fraction using an absorptive scrubber and/or a membrane. The remaining
    gaseous hydrocarbon products from the product stream are mixed with a fresh, optionally heated,
    hydrocarbon-containing gas stream after one cycle of the reaction.      Characteristically, the process
    uses at least one membrane to increase oxygen content of the oxygen containing gas and/or to
    remove non-hydrocarbon gases from the product stream as set forth above. In a refinement, multiple
    membranes are used in series. In another refinement, multiple membranes are used in parallel. In
    still other refinement, a first set of membranes are used in parallel simultaneous to a second set of
    membranes being used in series.
[12]         In another embodiment, a method for preparing oxygenated hydrocarbons is provided. The
    method includes a step of supplying to a reactor a first heated hydrocarbon-containing gas stream.
    An oxygen-containing gas stream is separately supplied to the reactor to form a reaction mixture.
    The oxygen-containing gas stream being optionally prepared by passing air through one or more
    oxygen-enriching membranes to increase oxygen content, to partially oxidize the hydrocarbon
    containing gas stream in a partial oxidation reaction.   One or more oxygenated hydrocarbons are
    separated and/or condensed from a product stream. Non-hydrocarbon gases are removed from the
    product stream to enrich a gaseous hydrocarbon fraction using a scrubber and/or a hydrocarbon
    enriching membrane. The remaining gaseous hydrocarbon product from the product stream is mixed
    with    a   fresh  first heated   hydrocarbon-containing  gas   stream   after one     reaction   cycle.
    Characteristically, at least one membrane is used to increase oxygen content of the oxygen
    containing gas stream and/or to remove non-hydrocarbon gases from the product stream.

    includes a step of supplying to a reactor a first heated hydrocarbon-containing gas stream.         An
    oxygen-containing gas stream is separately supplied to the reactor. Optionally prepared by passing
    air through one or more membranes to increase oxygen content, to oxidize the hydrocarbon

    supplying into the reactor an oxygen-containing gas, optionally one or more membranes to increase
    the oxygen content of the oxygen-containing gas supplied into the reactor, means for condensing
    and/or separating one or more of the desired liquid oxygenated hydrocarbons from the resulting
    product stream, a scrubber and/or a membrane to selectively remove non-hydrocarbon gases from
    the product stream, and means for mixing the remaining gaseous hydrocarbon product from the
    product stream with a fresh first heated hydrocarbon-containing gas stream after one cycle of the
    reaction. Characteristically, the apparatus is provided with at least one membrane.
515]        In another embodiment, a system implementing the method set forth above is provided. The
    system includes a reactor, a first hydrocarbon-containing gas supply means for supplying into the
    reactor a heated hydrocarbon-containing gas, a means for supplying into the reactor an oxygen
    containing gas, optionally one or more oxygen-enriching membranes to increase oxygen content of
    the oxygen-containing gas supplied into the reactor, a means for separating and/or condensing one or
    more liquid oxygenated hydrocarbons from a product stream, a scrubber and/or a hydrocarbon
    enriching membrane to remove non-hydrocarbon gases from the product stream, and a means for
    mixing remaining gaseous hydrocarbon product from the product stream with a fresh first heated
    hydrocarbon-containing gas stream after one reaction cycle, the system having at least one
    membrane.
016]        As can be seen, in accordance with the present teachings, a heated hydrocarbon-containing
    gas stream and oxygen-containing gas are supplied into a reactor, where a gas phase oxidation of the
    hydrocarbon-containing gas is performed at elevated temperature and pressure in the reaction zone.

         WO 2014/100813                                                        PCT/US2013/077488
    The oxygen-containing gas may preferably be prepared by passing air through one or more
    membranes to increase the oxygen content. The reaction mixture is cooled and separated into gas
    and liquid product. The gas may be scrubbed and/or passed through a membrane to selectively
    remove non-hydrocarbon gases and then returned to the heated hydrocarbon-containing gas stream
    prior to a second cycle of the reaction.
517]        The present invention is more efficient and cost-effective than the prior art processes. First,
    the PSA/VSA/cryo-oxygen unit can be replaced in part or in whole with a significantly lower cost
    membrane to enrich the air entering the system. A membrane may also be present within the recycle
    loop, with or without a scrubber, to further remove nitrogen and potentially other non-hydrocarbon
    gases such as carbon oxides and/or hydrogen. A further feature of the present invention is the use of
    separated carbon oxides and hydrogen for the synthesis of valuable oxygenated hydrocarbons. By
    these means, carbon efficiency is further enhanced. It may be necessary, when solid state membranes
    are used, to remove the liquid oxygenated hydrocarbon product by scrubbing out the liquid and/or by
    condensation followed by separating the liquids before contact is made with the membrane. This
    may prevent any fouling of the membrane which might otherwise occur. On the other hand, liquid
    membranes may potentially be used without the scrubbing or condensation/separation steps.
518]        Fresh hydrocarbon-containing feed gas may also be introduced into the recycle stream prior
    to contact with the membrane. Whether the feed is introduced before or after the selective non
    hydrocarbon removal system (membrane with or without additional scrubbers) will depend on the
    composition of the gases and the selectivity of the non-hydrocarbon removal system. A pure
    hydrocarbon feed will dilute the non-hydrocarbon gases in the recycle stream and decrease their
    partial  pressures.  Some     feeds,  however,  will   contain gases   that are   separable   by   the
    scrubbing/membrane system. For example, refinery, petrochemical, and coke production gases
    typically contain olefins, hydrogen, and/or carbon monoxide which would be advantageously
    separated by the membrane/scrubbing system and therefore should be introduced prior to contact
    with the membrane/scrubber but after the reactor in the recycle loop.
019]        The apparatus also has a mechanism for supplying into the reactor a non-oxidizing coolant to
    be directly mixed with a mixture of said heated hydrocarbon containing gas and said oxygen
    containing gas at a later stage of the reaction to inhibit the decomposition of formaldehyde. The
                                                      6

     coolant functions to inhibit the oxidation or decomposition of the formaldehyde product as well as
     regulate the temperature of the product gas prior to entering the cross exchanger. Unreacted
     hydrocarbon gas is then processed to separate liquid products and selectively remove non
     hydrocarbon gases before being recycled back into the hydrocarbon-containing gas stream.

10301         The embodiments relate to direct oxygenation conversion of at least one hydrocarbon into at
     least one oxygenated hydrocarbon. The direct oxygenation conversion of methane into methanol and
     oxygenates is a focal conversion goal of the technology.
10311         In one embodiment, an improved, compact, reactor system for executing the overall reaction
     for the partial oxidation of methane and/or natural gas to oxygenated hydrocarbons is provided. In
     overview, the system allows for the passing of a mixture of natural gas and oxidant through a heated,

     continuous flow reactor system under conditions to optimize the formation of methanol, and to
     manipulate the reactor temperature, total pressure, and fuel (e.g., without limitation, natural gas) to
     oxidant ratio to control the relative amounts of reaction products. The reaction is a partial oxidation
     of a hydrocarbon fuel, such as natural gas, by an oxidant, such as oxygen, air, or other suitable
     oxygen-containing compound (preferably oxygen in air or, most preferably, oxygen). The mixture
     contains a substantial excess of fuel (e.g., without limitation, natural gas) to prevent over oxidation
     to undesired products such as carbon dioxide and water. Advantageously, the system is suitable for
     small, isolated natural gas sources (stranded gas).
[532]        With reference to Figure 1, an apparatus for producing oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as
     methanol, is provided. The improvements of the present embodiment regarding the incorporation of
     selective membranes are applicable to the systems and methods set forth in US Patent Nos.
     7,179,843, 7,456,327, 7,578,981, 7,642,293 and 7,687,669, and Published US Patent Applications
    Nos. 20060204413, 20060223892, 200638283, 20070100005                   and 20070166212, the entire
     disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. System 10 includes reactor 12 for a gas
     phase oxidation of the hydrocarbon-containing gas. A hydrocarbon-containing gas stream 13
     (flowing through valve 14 and heater 18) and an oxygen-containing gas stream 20 are introduced
     into reactor 12. In a refinement, the hydrocarbon-containing gas stream 13 includes one or more C1s
     alkanes (e.g., methane, ethane, propane, etc.). Typically, hydrocarbon-containing gas stream 13 is
     heated. It should be appreciated that such heating may be provided by the action of a compressor on
     the hydrocarbon-containing gas. In a refinement, the oxygen-containing gas stream entering reactor
     12 comprises between 20 volume % and 100 volume % oxygen. In another refinement, the oxygen
     containing gas stream entering the reactor 12 includes less than 80 volume % nitrogen. As explained
     in detail below, the oxygen-containing gas preferably has greater than 30 volume % oxygen content,
     and more preferably greater than 80% oxygen content, to reduce the accumulation of inert gases in
     the recycle loop.     The reactor 12 further optionally receives a quenching cold hydrocarbon
     containing gas stream from valve 14 for reducing the temperature of the reaction products during
     operation of the apparatus.
033]         The reactor 12 is in fluid communication with a compressor 24 for supply of compressed
     oxygen-containing gas. Pressure of the raw hydrocarbon-containing gas is also increased using a
     compressor 26 for the supply of compressed gas. Section 28 represents a device or set of devices that
                                                         9

          WO 2014/100813                                                         PCT/US2013/077488
    is (are) configured to selectively separate non-hydrocarbon gases and products from a hydrocarbon
    containing recycle gas component. In particular, the raw hydrocarbon-containing gas is mixed with
    cleaned hydrocarbon gas from the non-hydrocarbon selective removal unit 30 depicted as recycle
    loop 32. In a refinement, non-hydrocarbon selective removal unit 30 is a membrane/scrubber system
    The raw hydrocarbon-containing gas and/or the cleaned hydrocarbon gas from the non-hydrocarbon
    selective removal unit 30 are heated by the hot reaction product gases in the cross exchanger 34.
    The preheater 18 serves to further heat the hydrocarbon-containing stream during start up. In the
    event that the raw hydrocarbon-containing gas stream 31 has a substantial content of non
    hydrocarbon gases, this stream can be introduced into the recycle loop 32 downstream of the
    condenser 38 and prior to entry of the non-hydrocarbon selective removal unit 30 for removal of said
    non-hydrocarbon gases.      The apparatus has a heat exchange device 34 for cooling the reaction
    product stream mixture and heating the reactant stream mixture. An additional cooling device 40
    cools the product stream before entering the partial condenser 38.
[34]         In operation, the raw hydrocarbon-containing gas stream with a methane content, for
    example, up to 99%, and the reduced hydrocarbon product stream are supplied from an installation
    for preparation of gas or any other source to the heater 18, in which it is heated to temperature 430
    4700 C. The heated hydrocarbon-containing gas is then supplied into reactor 12. Compressed oxygen
    enriched air with pressure, for example, of 7-8 MPa and with a ratio of about 20% to about 100%
    oxygen, is supplied by the compressor 24 and also into reactor 12. Oxidation of methane to methanol
    or methanol and formaldehyde takes place in reactor 12. To limit the amount of nitrogen within the
    system 10, for example, to less than about 30% to about 40%, or reduce the nitrogen-removal
    demand of membrane unit 44, the configuration of the membrane unit 46 may be modified to
    provide oxygen of greater purity and thus reduce the amount of nitrogen in the system.          In this
    regard, membrane unit 44 includes an oxygen-enriching membrane.
0351         An optional second stream of a lower temperature (e.g. cold) coolant than the gases fed via
    the cross exchanger 40 and the heater 18 to the reactor 12 may be supplied into reactor 12. This
    stream is regulated by a valve 14. This cold stream can be, for example, composed of a raw
    hydrocarbon stream, a recycled stream, or a portion or combination of the two. The coolant functions
    to reduce the temperature of the partially oxidized methane to reduce the continued oxidation or
    decomposition of any formed formaldehyde. The coolant can also control heat transfer over cross
                                                      10

         WO 2014/100813                                                           PCT/US2013/077488
    exchanger 34.       By introduction of the coolant, such as a cold hydrocarbon-containing gas, the
    temperature of the reaction is reduced by at least 300 C within the reaction vessel, for example by
    30-90'C. In a refinement, a second hydrocarbon-containing gas stream is supplied to the reactor
    downstream of the first heated hydrocarbon-containing gas stream and the oxygen-containing gas
    stream at a temperature below that of the first heated hydrocarbon-containing gas stream. In a
    refinement, the second hydrocarbon-containing gas stream includes one or more C1 5 alkanes (e.g.,
    methane, ethane, propane, etc).      In a further refinement, the second hydrocarbon-containing gas
    stream is supplied to the reactor at a temperature of 0 'C to 100 C. Advantageously, the second
    hydrocarbon-containing gas stream is adjusted to mitigate decomposition of formaldehyde in the
    reactor.
536]         In partial condenser 38, water and liquid oxygenates are separated from a gaseous mixture of
    hydrocarbons as well as non-hydrocarbon gases such as nitrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide,
    carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The partial condenser 38 is preferably isobaric, as opposed to
    isothermal, to avoid pressure losses.
537]         Processing of the liquid streams first includes a flash drum 50 for removal of dissolved gases
    in the liquids followed by a stripper column 60 in which light alcohols are separated from aldehydes
    and water. Aldehydes, higher alcohols and water exit the bottom of column 60 in stream 3, which
    may then be further processed for purification of specific fractions and/or utilization of these
    products to produce higher value products.
0381         The reaction mixture is supplied into the heat exchanger 34 for transfer of heat to the reactor
    input stream from the reaction mixture exiting the reactor, and, after further cooling, is supplied to
    the partial condenser 38. Separation of the mixture into high and low volatility components (dry gas
    and raw liquid, respectively) is performed in the partial condenser 38, in which aldehydes are also
    recovered. The dry gas is forwarded to non-hydrocarbon selective removal unit 30 (membrane or
    membrane and scrubber), while the raw liquids from the condenser 38 are supplied to the flash drum
    50.
0391         To minimize the buildup of undesirable non-hydrocarbon gases in the recycle loop, an air
    separation membrane 46 (i.e., a hydrocarbon-enriching membrane) may separate nitrogen from
                                                         11

          WO 2014/100813                                                       PCT/US2013/077488
    oxygen to provide an oxygen-rich stream 20. In particular, air separation membrane 46 is used to
    increase the efficiency of the present process of system 10 by providing oxygen at purities higher
    than that of atmospheric oxygen (21% volume oxygen, 78% volume nitrogen, 1% volume argon).
    The membrane is used in preference to means such as pressure-swing adsorption (hereinafter
    "PSA"), vacuum swing adsorption (hereinafter "VSA") or cryogenic separations, all of which are
    expensive from both capital and operational perspectives.      Membrane 44 provides selective non
    hydrocarbon removal to prevent nitrogen buildup in the recycle loop 32.
540]         Typically, air is passed through separation membrane 46 to enrich the oxygen content, for
    example, by removing at least a portion of the nitrogen present. Suitable membranes for this purpose
    include ceramic ion transport membranes composed of metal oxides such as aluminum oxide and
    titanium oxide, which are often capable of generating oxygen at high purities. Zirconia-based
    oxygen separation membrane materials have also shown good chemical stability and mechanical
    properties. In another variation, separation membrane 46 includes polymers such as polyimides in
    order to enhance the oxygen content.
541]         In such systems, oxygen is selectively permeated across the membrane to form a low
    pressure oxygen enriched permeate stream and a high pressure nitrogen enriched retentate stream.
    Common purities for a single membrane enrichment system range from 35 to 45 volume percent
    oxygen. The degree of enrichment depends on parameters such as flow rate and differential pressure
    over the membrane. Multiple membrane systems with recycle are technically feasible although
    recompression costs and oxygen recovery must be taken into consideration. Current common
    practice is to utilize such membranes as nitrogen generation units for purging and blanketing
    purposes. Therefore, these membranes are widely available and at a low cost. It is also feasible to
    use a membrane in combination with a cryogenic or adsorption based ASU in order to reduce capital
    costs and provide oxygen at an intermediate purity such as 45-80 volume percent. It should be
    appreciated that the system of the present embodiment may be coupled to a nitrogen producing
    facility that vents oxygen gas thereby providing a source of oxygen for producing oxygenates.
042]         As set forth above, section 28 represents a device or set of devices that are configured to
    selectively separate non-hydrocarbon gases and products from a hydrocarbon-containing recycle gas
    component. In particular, non-hydrocarbon selective removal unit 30 represents the device(s)
                                                       12

          WO 2014/100813                                                         PCT/US2013/077488
    configured to selectively remove non-hydrocarbon gases from the recycle loop 32. Section 30 can
    take the form of a membrane separation unit 44 alone or integrated with a scrubber as represented by
    vessel 54. In a refinement, non-hydrocarbon selective removal unit 30 is used to regulate the
    percentage of non-hydrocarbon gases in the recycle loop consisting of nitrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen
    sulfide carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. In this regard, it should be appreciated that nitrogen
    must be removed to prevent the buildup in the recycle loop 32. In previous practice, the only cost
    effective method to remove nitrogen was by purging a portion of the recycle gas stream. Nitrogen
    removal without a membrane is especially problematic. Options include pressure sing adsorption
    (PSA), cryogenic means, and possibly reactive scrubbing should appropriate solvents be developed
    in the future. PSA is impractical as a means of nitrogen removal as the operational costs are
    currently prohibitive with the low conversion, high recycle characteristics of the direct partial
    oxidation process. Cryogenic nitrogen removal also requires excessive operational costs to achieve
    the temperatures needed for separation. An example of a nitrogen-absorbing technology that is used
    in the present embodiment to increase the oxygen content of the oxygen containing gas is provided
    by U.S. Pat. No. 6,136,222 which describes a nitrogen-absorbing transition metal complex using
    various ligands such as organophosphine ligands. Such a solution acts as the absorbent in a counter
    current rectification column employed to scrub the recycle gas, although this requires on-stream
    absorbant regeneration and is intolerant of high levels of CO and 02
543]        Section 28 includes non-hydrocarbon selective removal unit 30 which functions to remove
    non-hydrocarbon gases that are both by-products of the partial oxidation reaction and impurities
    introduced via the feed gas and/or oxygen containing gas streams. The membrane unit 44 functions
    to remove nitrogen, hydrogen and/or carbon oxides. Integration with the scrubber 54 may also be
    utilized for removal of such gases and of other impurities, including sulfur-containing compounds
    which may potentially poison the membrane. In this regard, the scrubber 54 uses both water and
    methanol at between about 7 to about 8 MPa pressure and between about 0' C and about 500 C to
    absorb carbon dioxide and hydrated formaldehyde. Once a portion of the non-hydrocarbon gas is
    removed to prevent excessive buildup, the reduced stream of hydrocarbon gas is recycled by mixing
    the reduced stream with the raw hydrocarbon-containing gas stream either before or within the
    reactor by the quench, as desired. If necessary, as in the case of excessive impurities in the feed gas,
    this feed gas may be combined with the recycle gas after exiting the condenser 38 and before
                                                       13

         WO 2014/100813                                                        PCT/US2013/077488
    entering non-hydrocarbon selective removal unit 30, in stream 58. The raw hydrocarbon and reduced
    streams, individually or in combination, are then inputted into reactor 12 after being heated by heat
    exchanger 34 and heater 18 as previously described.        Stripping column 60 is used to separate
    alcohols (light-key component) from water and hydrated formaldehyde.
544]        For selective removal of carbon monoxide by scrubber 54, a number of patents describe the
    use of a CuCl CO complexing solution. To date, only the Cosolv process has been commercialized.
    Toluene selectively absorbs methane at the pressures employed in the present invention.
    Furthermore, corrosivity issues and incompatibility would prohibit the usage of this technology in
    the present apparatus. Copper (I) is unstable and has a tendency to disproportionate into elemental
    copper and Cu(II), thereby degrading the solvent. As an example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,508,694 provides a
    solution to the problem of disproportionation in part by usage of a stabilizing agent in addition to a
    fluorinated acetoacetonate. The halogenated acetoacetonate complexes the CO with CuCl in a
    counter current rectification column. Drawbacks include the expense of and difficulty of synthesis of
    the absorbant as well as high methane solubility for many of the named solvents which stabilize the
    system. Future selenium based solvents could be employed which would be able to undergo
    carbonylation.
545]        Utilization of at least one membrane for selective removal of non-hydrocarbon gases in the
    recycle loop 32, especially carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, and
    nitrogen, would permit for increased efficiencies as well as utilization of less concentrated oxygen
    sources. In many membrane materials, CO behaves much like N 2 in terms of selectivity and
    permeability. Membranes for separation of carbon dioxide from natural gas have been available
    since the 1980's and are typically composed of cellulose acetate, polyimides and perfluoropolymers.
    Hydrogen separation membranes include dense metals, nano-porous inorganic materials, organic
    polymers and dense ion transport membranes based on proton conducting materials; composites
    consisting of combinations of these main material groups are also becoming more common.
046]        Suitable membrane assemblies for removal of non-hydrocarbon gases from the recycle
    system would ideally offer N 2/CH 4 selectivities greater than 1 so as to perform the same carbon
    dioxide removal function of an absorbent based scrubbing system. Furthermore, CO 2 and H 2
    selectivities should be much higher than methane. Loss of pressure over these membranes must be
                                                     14

         WO 2014/100813                                                           PCT/US2013/077488
    minimal so as to minimize recompression costs in the recycle system. Furthermore, the membrane
    should have a MAWP of greater than 6 MPa to accommodate typical operating conditions of the
    recycle system.
547]         Although not highly selective for nitrogen, the nitrogen selectivity of some nitrogen selective
    membrane materials over methane is greater than 2. These membrane materials also possess a
    carbon dioxide selectivity over methane of greater than 20. This membrane module permits for
    greater selectivity as an alternative to a traditional crude purge stream. The resulting permeate
    stream will contain a substantial portion of methane, yet would be enriched in non-hydrocarbon
    gases such that it would perform the same function as a purge gas stream with increased selectivity
    for the non-hydrocarbon gases, so that the selective purge steam may still be used as potential fuel
    source or feedstock for additional chemical processing.
548]         Although the main value provided therein is in separating the especially problematic nitrogen
    and CO from hydrocarbons in the recycle system, these membranes also separate other non
    hydrocarbon gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and hydrogen sulfide with high selectivity on
    the permeate side of the membrane. When left in the recycle system, these non-hydrocarbon gases
    inhibit the partial oxidation reaction, but when removed can be further utilized to enhance the overall
    yield of oxygenated hydrocarbon products.
549]         Another concern is the buildup of carbon dioxide which, to date, has been removed by either
    an absorbtion process or purge stream. Carbon dioxide can build up as follows: under a single pass, a
    portion normally of less than 60% by volume depending on the recycle ratio and oxygen to
    hydrocarbon ratio, of the methane is oxidized to carbon monoxide by a portion of the input oxygen
    source. After subsequent passes, a portion of this carbon monoxide, if not removed, is further
    oxidized to carbon dioxide by additional input oxygen. This increases the demand for valuable
    oxygen. Further oxygen may be inappropriately consumed if hydrogen remains in the cycle as it
    would selectively convert to water after one pass through the reactor. Therefore, prior to the present
    invention, the partial oxidation process of hydrocarbon mixtures such as natural gas to liquid
    oxygenates was not as efficient as desired due to the extraneous consumption of oxygen and the
    unwanted generation of carbon oxides which reduced yields of the desired oxygenated
    hydrocarbons.
                                                       15

         WO 2014/100813                                                          PCT/US2013/077488
550]        The non-hydrocarbon gas fraction removed from the recycle loop may be further processed
    in a reactor 70 for the generation of higher valued products, as further described below. In another
    refinement, the one or more separated non-hydrocarbon gases are converted to hydrocarbon which
    may be used as part of the first hydrocarbon-containing gas stream.
551]        When an absorption scrubber 54 is used together with the membrane unit 44, modification of
    the flow rate of the absorbant or the operating temperature of the scrubber column can be used to
    meet the minimum absorption requirements. If it is desirable to operate at extremely low absorbent
    flow rates, then a lower temperature can be utilized, as occurs for many physical solvents such as
    those containing methanol for example.        It should be appreciated that typically, the scrubber's
    absorbant reacts with one or more non-hydrocarbon gases in a reversible reaction. If it is desirable to
    operate at ambient temperatures or temperatures achievable via typical cooling water, then a high
    flow rate can be utilized, for example, ten times that of the flow rate for 0' C. In either scenario, the
    saturated scrubbing fluid 74 and liquid oxygenate product streams 78 are degassed in flashed drum
    50 and light alcohols are partially separated from aldehydes and water in a stripper column 60. In
    another refinement, the scrubber uses hydrated formaldehyde as an absorbant to remove hydrogen
    sulfide and/or sulfur dioxide.
552]        Advantageously, reactor 70 may incorporate a number of different processes which utilize
    the gaseous predominantly non-hydrocarbon stream 72, composed especially of nitrogen, hydrogen,
    carbon monoxide and/or carbon dioxide, for synthesis of more valuable products. These products
    include, but are not limited to, methanol, syngas or mixtures thereof, mixed alcohols or higher
    homolog alcohols, aldehydes, carboxylic acids and esters, carbonate esters, ammonia, etc. Some of
    these synthesis processes may also include the generated liquid products as reaction inputs.
053]        Reaction conditions favoring the best selectivity for methanol and other oxygenates are as
    follows: The composition of the reaction mixture, after combining the heated hydrocarbon feed
    stream and the oxygen-containing feed stream, should be from about 1 mol % to about 10 mol %
    oxidant, preferably from about 2 mol % to about 5 mol % oxidant, and most preferably at about 2.5
    mol % oxidant. The total pressure of the gases in the reactor system should be in the range of from
    about 5 MPa to about 10 MPa, preferably from about 5 MPa to about 9 MPa, and most preferably at
    about 8 Mpa. The reactor system wall temperature should be in the range of from about 600 K to
                                                       16

          WO 2014/100813                                                       PCT/US2013/077488
     about 900 K, and more preferably from about 723 K to about 823 K. The overall reactor residence
     time should be in the range of from about 1 second to about 40 seconds, more preferably from about
     1 second to about 10 seconds, and most preferably from about 1 second to about 2.5 seconds.
[54]         For continuous operation, the fuel (e.g., natural gas) and oxidant are typically well-mixed.
     For this purpose a mixing chamber/reactor is supplied for both thoroughly mixing the reaction
     components and for also inducing the generation of alkyl (e.g., without limitation, methyl) free
     radicals that are then contained in the output stream from the mixing chamber. In this regard, the
     mixing chamber therefore effectively provides an injectively-mixed backmixing reaction chamber
     ("backmix reaction chamber") in a reactor system having an injectively-mixed backmixing reaction
     chamber in fluid communication with a tubular-flow reactor for carrying out the overall reaction.
     Details of a design that may be used to create such a backmixing chamber are set forth in U.S. Pat.
     Pub. No. 20070166212, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The
     injectively-mixed backmixing reaction chamber has a space-time, respective to a combined feed rate
     of the alkane-containing feed stream and the oxygen-containing feed stream, of from about 0.05
     seconds to about 1.5 seconds (a preferably contemplated space-time is about 0.1 seconds) so that the
     feeds can be effectively mixed and so that an initial induction period for generating alkyl free
     radicals (e.g., without limitation, methyl free radicals) can be accommodated before the injectively
     mixed backmixing reaction chamber product stream (methane, oxygen, and methyl free radicals) is
     fed to the tubular-flow reactor for further reaction into methanol.
0551         In another variation, the design of the injectively-mixed backmixing reaction chamber
     enables injective intermixing of the alkane and oxygen-containing feed streams to turbulently agitate
     streams together and to effectively turbulently agitate the injectively-mixed backmixing reaction
     chamber. In this regard, the generating of methyl free radicals is perceived to be the first kinetic
     reaction step in the set of kinetic step reactions that achieve direct oxygenation of methane to
     methanol (one respective alkyl oxygenate), and the use of an injectively-mixed backmixing reaction
     chamber prior to the tubular-flow reactor enables a degree of freedom for independent optimization
     of this methyl free radical induction step. Other free radicals derived from C2-C4 alkanes should
     usually have a shorter induction period than the methyl free radical under comparable conditions.
     The subsequent chain branching kinetic sub-reactions (kinetic sub-reaction steps) then converts the
     methyl free radicals and other components of the injectively-mixed backmixing reaction chamber
                                                         17

          WO 2014/100813                                                          PCT/US2013/077488
    product stream to methanol and other products; these later sub-reactions are best controlled in the
    tubular-flow reactor environment that has traditionally received the admixed, but unreacted, methane
    ( or other alkane) and oxygen of prior systems.
5561         The reactor walls must be inert in the chemical environment of the reaction. The reactor
    construction material must be steel, preferably stainless steel, to contain the necessary total pressure.
    Insofar as a steel surface diminishes methanol selectivity, the steel is preferably coated with an inert
    coating, such as TeflonTM, or an organic wax. Addition examples of coatings include, but are not
    limited to, Cotronics Resbond Ultra Temp 904 Zirconia Adhesive & Coating, Cerakote C-7300
    Cerakote V-166, and the like. Insertion of a Pyrex TM or quartz sleeve into the reactor also provides a
    relatively inert surface.
557]         In another embodiment, the flow restriction baffle (bulkhead with apertures for enabling a
    fluid passageway) is conveniently axially movable so that alternative baffle positions can be
    deployed in custom-configuring the effective space-time in the injectively-mixed backmixing
    reaction chamber prior to a process run instance or during a process run.
558]         In another embodiment, the flow restriction baffle is further in close proximity to a blocking
    component that is conveniently axially movable so that variable baffle (bulkhead) passageways can
    be defined by partially blocking the apertures in the baffle (bulkhead) in custom-configuring the
    effective space-time in the injectively-mixed backmixing reaction chamber prior to a process run
    instance or during a process run; this feature provides another degree of freedom for operational
    control.
0591         The methanol and other oxygenates can undergo thermal decomposition in the high
    temperatures of the tubular-flow reactor, resulting in product loss. Such decomposition is minimized
    by cooling of the reactor contents at a location immediately downstream from the "hot spot".
    Because wall cooling is not sufficiently responsive, a preferred embodiment employs injection of a
    cold gas by means of a tube whose axial position can also be changed by means of a sliding seal.
    The cold gas is preferably natural gas, but carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or another inert substance may
    also be used.
