CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] This reference is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No.
2013295763, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.
BACKGROUND
[0002]   As growers in recent years have increasingly incorporated additional sensors and
controllers on agricultural implements such as row crop planters, the control and monitoring
systems for such implements have grown increasingly complex. Installation and maintenance of
such systems have become increasingly difficult. Thus there is a need in the art for effective
control and monitoring of such systems. In planting implements incorporating seed conveyors,
special control and monitoring challenges arise; thus there is also a particular need for effective
seed counting and effective incorporation of the seed conveyor into the implement control and
monitoring system.
OBJECT
[0003]   It is an object of the present invention to at least substantially satisfy the above need.
SUMMARY
[0004]   In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a monitoring system for an
agricultural implement having a plurality of row units, the monitoring system comprising:
         a seed meter;
         a seed conveyor having a first side and a second side, said seed conveyor being
disposed to receive seeds from said seed meter, wherein said seed conveyor is configured to
guide seeds down said first side of said seed conveyor to a lower end of said seed conveyor,
wherein said seed conveyor is configured to release seeds from said lower end; and
        a control module in data communication with said seed meter and said seed conveyor for
controlling a rate of said seed meter and a rate of said seed conveyor.

of the motor 578. The motor encoder signal conditioning chip 316 is preferably in electrical
communication with the motor encoder 576, which is preferably configured to generate a signal
indicative of driving speed of the motor 570, e.g., by generating a defined number of encoder

                                                  6
pulses per motor shaft rotation. The motor current signal conditioning chip 314 is preferably in
electrical communication with the motor PWM driver 318 far sampling the actual current

                                                   7
Row Networks - Conveyor Module
[0044]    Turning to FIG. 4, the conveyor module 400 preferably includes a bus node 402
(preferably a CAN node including a CAN transceiver, a controller, and a processor). The CAN
node, specifically the CAN transceiver, is preferably in electrical communication with the row
bus 250. The conveyor module 400 preferably further includes a memory 406 and a processor

The signal conditioning chips 432,434 are preferably in electrical communication with optical
sensors 582,584, respectively.
Implementation on Planter Row Units
[0045]    Referring to FIG. 5A, a planter row unit 500 is illustrated with components of the
control system 100 installed. The row unit 500 illustrated in FIG. 5A is one of the row units to
which a multi-row control module 200 is mounted.
[0046]    In the row unit 500, a downforce actuator 510 (preferably a hydraulic cylinder) is
mounted to the toolbar 14. The downforce actuator 510 is pivotally connected at a lower end to
a parallel linkage 516. The parallel linkage 516 supports the row unit 500 from the toolbar 14,
permitting each row unit to move vertically independently of the toolbar and the other spaced
row units in order to accommodate changes in terrain or upon the row unit encountering a rock
or other obstruction as the planter is drawn through the field. Each row unit 500 further includes
a mounting bracket 520 to which is mounted a hopper support beam 522 and a subframe 524.
The hopper support beam 522 supports a seed hopper 526 and a fertilizer hopper 528 as well as
operably supporting a seed meter 530 and a seed tube 532. The subframe 524 operably supports
a furrow opening assembly 534 and a furrow closing assembly 536.
[0047]    In operation of the row unit 500, the furrow opening assembly 534 cuts a furrow 38 into
the soil surface 40 as the planter is drawn through the field. The seed hopper 526, which holds
the seeds to be planted, communicates a constant supply of seeds 42 to the seed meter 530. The
drive module 300 is preferably mounted to the seed meter 530 as described elsewhere herein.

                                                  8
As the drive module 300 drives the seed meter 530, individual seeds 42 are metered and
discharged into the seed tube 532 at regularly spaced intervals based on the seed population
desired and the speed at which the planter is drawn through the field. The seed sensor 508,
preferably an optical sensor, is supported by the seed tube 532 and disposed to detect the
presence of seeds 42 as they pass. The seed 42 drops from the end of the seed tube 532 into the
furrow 38 and the seeds 42 are covered with soil by the closing wheel assembly 536.
[0048]    The furrow opening assembly 534 preferably includes a pair of furrow opening disk
blades 544 and a pair of gauge wheels 548 selectively vertically adjustable relative to the disk
blades 544 by a depth adjusting mechanism 568. The depth adjusting mechanism 568
preferably pivots about a downforce sensor 506, which preferably comprises a pin instrumented
with strain gauges for measuring the force exerted on the gauge wheels 548 by the soil 40. The
downforce sensor 506 is preferably of the type disclosed in Applicant's co-pending U.S. Patent
Application No. 12/522,253, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety
by reference. In other embodiments, the downforce sensor is of the types disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 6,389,999, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by
reference. The disk blades 544 are rotatably supported on a shank 554 depending from the
subframe 524. Gauge wheel arms 560 pivotally support the gauge wheels 548 from the subframe
524. The gauge wheels 548 are rotatably mounted to the forwardly extending gauge wheel arms
560.
[0049]    It should be appreciated that the row unit illustrated in FIG. 5A does not include a
conveyor 580 such that a conveyor module 400 is not required. Turning to FIG. 5B, a planter
row unit 500' including a conveyor 580 is illustrated with components of the control system 100
installed.
[0050] The row unit 500' is similar to the row unit 500 described above, except that the seed
tube 532 has been removed and replaced with a conveyor 580 configured to convey seeds at a
controlled rate from the meter 530 to the furrow 42. The conveyor motor 590 is preferably
mounted to the conveyor 580 and is configured to selectively drive the conveyor 580. The
conveyor 580 is preferably one of the types disclosed in Applicant's U.S. patent application no.
61/539,786 and Applicant's co-pending international patent application no.
PCT/US2012/057327, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein in their entirety
by reference. As disclosed in that application, the conveyor 580 preferably includes a belt 587

                                                 9
including flights 588 configured to convey seeds received from the seed meter 530 to a lower
end of the conveyor. On the view of FIG. 5B, the seed conveyor 580 is preferably configured to
drive the belt 587 in a clockwise direction. On the view of FIG. 5B, the seed conveyor 580 is
preferably configured to guide seeds from an upper end of the conveyor down a forward side of
the conveyor, such that seeds descend with flights 588 of the belt 587 on forward side of the
conveyor 580 and are deposited from the lower end of the conveyor such that no seeds are
present on flights 588 ascending the rearward side of the conveyor during normal operation.
The optical sensor 582 is preferably mounted to the forward side of the conveyor 580 and
disposed to detect seeds and descending conveyor flights 588 as they pass. The optical sensor
584 is preferably mounted to the rearward side of the conveyor 580 and disposed to detect
ascending conveyor flights 588 as they return to the meter 530. In other embodiments the
optical sensor 582 and/or the optical sensor 584 may be replaced with other object sensors
configured to detect the presence of seeds and/or flights, such as an electromagnetic sensor as
disclosed in Applicant's co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 12/984,263 (Pub. No.
US2012/0169353).
Addition of Modular Components
[0051]    Comparing the embodiments of FIGs. 5A and 5B, it should be appreciated that some
embodiments of control system 100 require a conveyor module 400 while some do not. Thus
row buses 250 are preferably configured to allow the user to install one or more additional CAN
modules without replacing or modifying the row buses 250.
[0052]    Referring to FIG. 6A, a modified control system 100' includes modified row buses 250'
having a modular extension 600 at each row. Each modular extension 600 preferably includes a
first drop 610 and a second drop 620. Each drop 610, 620 preferably includes connections to
power, ground and the bus signal lines (e.g., CAN Hi and CAN Lo).
[0053]    Turning to FIG. 6B, a modified control system 100" differs from control system 100'
in that a conveyor module 400 has been connected to the first drop 610 of each modular
extension 600. It should be appreciated that the second drop 620 is still available to add further
modules to the row networks 130.
[0054]    Operation - Configuration Phase

                                                    10
[0055]   In order to effectively operate the control system 100 of FIG. 1, each module is
preferably configured to determine its identity (e.g., the row unit or row units 500 with which it
is associated) and certain configuration data such as the relative location of its associated row
unit. Thus in operation of the control system 100, a configuration process 700 (FIG. 7) is
preferably carried out to identify the modules and transmit configuration data to each module.
At step 705, the monitor 110 preferably sends a first identification signal to the multi-row
control module 200a via a point-to-point connection 160. The multi-row control module 200a
preferably stores identification data (e.g., indicating its status as the leftmost multi-row control
module) in memory. Continuing to refer to step 705, the multi-row control module 200a
preferably sends a second identification signal to the multi-row control module 200b via a point
to-point electrical connection 161. The multi-row control module 200b preferably stores
identification data (e.g., indicating its status as the rightmost multi-row control module) in
memory.
[0056]   At step 710, each row module (e.g., each drive module 300 and each conveyor module
400) preferably determines the row unit 500 with which it is associated based on the voltage on
an identification line (not shown) connecting the row module to the row bus 150. For example,
three identification lines leading to the drive modules 300-1,300-2,300-3 are preferably
connected to ground, a midrange voltage, and a high voltage, respectively.
[0057]   At step 715, the monitor 110 preferably transmits row-network-specific configuration
data to each multi-row control module 200 via the implement bus 150. For example, the
configuration data preferably includes transverse and travel-direction distances from each row
unit 500 to the GPS receiver 166 and to the center of the toolbar 14 ("GPS offsets"); the row
network-specific GPS offsets sent to multi-row control module 200a at step 715 preferably
corresponds to the row units 500-1,500-2,500-3 within the row network 130a. At step 720, each
multi-row control module 200 preferably transmits row-unit-specific configuration data to each
row control module (e.g, the drive modules 300) via the row buses 250. For example, the multi
row control module 200a preferably sends GPS offsets corresponding to row unit 500-1 to the
drive module 300-1.
Operation - Drive Module Control

                                                   11
[0058]   Tuning to F[G. 8, the control system 100 preferably controls each drive module 300
according to a process 800. At step 805, the monitor 110 preferably transmits an input
prescription (eg., a number of seeds per acre to be planted) to each nmulti-row control module
200 via the implement bus 150 ofthe implement network 135. At step 8I1,         the various
kinematic sensors in the control system 100 transmit cinematic signals to the central processor
 120. For example, wheel speed sensors 164 and gyro 162 send speed signals and angular
velocity signals, respectively, to the central processor 120 via point-to-point electrical
connections. In some embodiments the monitor 110 also sends the speed reported by the speed
sensor 168 to the central processor 120 via the implement bus 150, which speed is sent to the
central processor 120 via the implement bus '50.
[0059]   At step 8 15. the central processor 120 preferably calculates the speed of tie center of
the toolbar 14 and the angular velocity of the toolbar 14. The speed Sc ofthe center ofthe
toolbar may be calculated by averaging the wheel speeds Swa,Swb reported by the wheel speed
sensors 164a,164b, respectively or using the tractor speed reported by the speed sensor 168.
The angular velocity w of the toolbar 14 may be determined from an angular velocity signal
generated by the gyroscope 162 or by using the equation:

angular velocity to each multi-row control module 200 via the implement bus 150 of the
implement network 135
[0061]   At step 825, each multi-row control module 200 preferably determines a meter speed
command (e.g., a desired number of meter rotations per second) for each drive module within its
row network 130. The meter speed command for each row unit 500 is preferably calculated
based on a row-specific speed Sr ofthe row unit. Therow-specific speed Srispreferably

[0063]    At step 830, the multi-row control module 200 preferably transmits the meter speed
command determined for each drive module 300 to the respective drive module via the row bus
250 of the row network 130. In embodiments in which the row bus 250 comprises a CAN bus,
the multi-romw control module 200 preferably transmits a frame to the row bus having an
identifier field specifying a drive module 300 (eg., module 300-2) and a data field including the
meter speed command for the specified drive module.
[0064]    At step 835, the drive module300 preferably compares the meterspeed command Rto
a measured meter speed The drive module 300 preferably calculates the measured meter speed
using the time between encoder pulses received from the motor encoder 576. At step 840, the
drive module 300 preferably adjusts a voltage used to drive die meter 530 in order to adjust the
measured meter speed closer to the meter speed command R.
[0065]    Al step 845, each seed     sensends seed pulses to the associated multi-row control
module 200. In embodiments including a seed tube 532, each seed sensor 508 preferably sends
seed pulses to the associated multi-row control module 200 via point-to-point electrical
connections. In embodiments including a seed tube 532, seed pulses preferably comprise signal

                                                 13
pulses having maximum values exceeding a predetermined threshold. In some embodiments
including a seed conveyor 580, each seed sensor 582 preferably sends seed pulses to the
associated multi-row control module 200 via the implement bus 250 of the row network 130. In
embodiments including a seed conveyor 580, the seed pulses comprise signal pulses that differ
by a predetermined threshold from signal pulses caused by passing flights of the conveyor.
Alternative methods of detecting seeds in a seed conveyor 580 are described later herein.
[0066]   At step 850, the multi-row control module 200 preferably calculates the population,
singulation and seed spacing at each row unit 500 within the row network 130 using the row
speed Sr and the seed pulses transmitted from each row unit within the row network. At step
855, the multi-row module 200 transmits the population, singulation and spacing values to the
central processor 120 via the implement bus 150 of the implement network 130. At step 860,
the central processor 120 preferably transmits the population, singulation and spacing values to
the monitor 110 via the implement bus 150 of the implement network 135.
Operation - Conveyor Module Control
[0067]   Turning to FIG. 9, the control system 100 preferably controls each conveyor module
400 according to a process 900. At steps 910 through 920, control system 100 preferably
performs the same steps described with respect to steps 810 through 820 of process 800. At step
925, each multi-row control module 200 preferably determines a conveyor speed command for
each conveyor module 400 within the row network 130. The conveyor speed command is
preferably selected such that a linear speed of flights traveling down the conveyor is
approximately equal to the row-specific speed Sr; e.g., the conveyor motor speed command is
preferably equal to the row-specific speed Sr multiplied by a predetermined constant. At step
930, the multi-row control module 200 preferably transmits individual conveyor speed
commands to each corresponding conveyor module 400 via the row bus 250 of the row network
130.
[0068]   At step 935, the conveyor module 400 preferably compares the conveyor speed
command to a measured conveyor speed. In some embodiments, the conveyor speed is
measured using the time between flight pulses resulting from conveyor flights passing the
optical sensor 584. In other embodiments, the conveyor speed is measured using the time
between encoder pulses received from the conveyor motor encoder 597. At step 940, the

                                                  14
conveyor module 400 preferably adjusts a voltage used to drive the conveyor motor 590 in order
to adjust the measured meter speed closer to the conveyor speed command.
[0069]   At steps 945 through 960, the conveyor module 400 preferably performs the same steps
845 through 860 described herein with respect to process 800, specifically as those steps are
described for embodiments including a conveyor 580.
Seed Sensing Methods
[0070]    In embodiments including a seed conveyor 580, the control system 100 is preferably
configured to count seeds, time-stamp seeds, and determine a seeding rate based on the signals
generated by the first and second optical sensors 582, 584. It should be appreciated that in
normal operation, the first optical sensor 582 detects both seeds and conveyor flights as the
seeds from the meter 530 descend the conveyor 580, while the second optical sensor 584 detects
only conveyor flights as they return to the top of the conveyor after seeds are deposited. The
shape and size of flights in the conveyor 580 are preferably substantially consistent.
[0071]   Referring to FIG. 17, the monitor 110 (or in some embodiments the central processor
120) is preferably configured to carry out a process 1700 for detecting seeds. At step 1710, the
monitor 110 preferably receives signals from both the first optical sensor 582 and the second
optical sensor 584 over a measuring period. A first optical sensor signal 1810 (in which
amplitude increases when either flights or seeds pass) and a second optical sensor signal 1820
(in which amplitude increases when flights pass) are illustrated on an exemplary multi-signal
graph 1800 in FIG. 18. At step 1715, the control system 100 preferably changes the conveyor
speed during the measuring period such that the length of signal pulses resulting from belts
having the same length (as best illustrated by viewing the varying-width pulses in the sensor
signal 1820). At step 1720, the monitor 110 preferably applies a time shift Ts (e.g., the time
shift Ts illustrated in FIG. 18) to the second optical sensor signal 1820, resulting in a time
shifted sensor signal 1820'. The time shift Ts is related to the conveyor speed and is preferably
calculated as follows:
                                             Ts = k X Tf
        Where:      Tf = Average time between flights detected by the second optical sensor 258

                                                  15
                    k - A constant value preferably determined as described below.
[0072]    The value of k is related to the conveyor and optical sensor geometry and in some
embodiments is determined as follows:
                                        k=-Tf XDEC(D
                                                         Df)
         Where:     Ds   Linear flight distance between the first and second optical sensor
                    Df Distance between flights
                    DEC(x) returns the decimal portion of x (eg., DEC(1052)        02).
[OO7]     In other embodiments, the monitor 110 preferably calculates k empirically in a setup
stage while seeds are not being planted by running the conveyor 580 at a constant speed and
determining the values of Tf and Ts; with no seeds on the belt. the value of Ts may be
determined by measuring the time between a flight pulse at the first optical sensor 582 and the
next subsequent flight pulse at the second optical sensor 584. In still other embodiments, the
season 582. 584 are positioned at a relative distance Ds equal to an integer multiple offt such
that no time shift or a near-zrm time shift is required.
[0074]    Continuing to refer to the process 1700 of FIG. 17, at step 1725 tie monitor 110
preferably subtracts the time-shifted second optical sensor signal 1820' from the first optical
sensor signal 1810, resulting in a flight-corrected signal 1830 (see FIG. 18) which correlates to
the signal from the first optical sensor signal with signal pulses resulting from conveyor flights
substantially eliminated. At step 1730 the monitor 110 preferably compares pulses 1832 in the
flight-corrected signal 1830 to one or more seed pulse validity thresholds (e.g., a minimum
amplitude threshold and a minimum period threshold); the monitor preferably identifies each
pulse exceeding the seed pulse validity thresholds as valid seed event. At step 1735, the monitor
 110 preferably adds the identified seed event to a seed count. At step 1740, the monitor 110
preferably stores the seed count; seeding rate (e.g. the seed count over a predetermined time
period); a time associated withb the seed event, seed count, or seeding rate; and a GPS associated
with the seed event, seed count, or seeding rate to memory for mapping. display and data
storage.

networks 132 includes a single-row control module 202 mounted to one of the row units 500, a
row bus 250, a drive module 300 individually mounted to the same row unit 500, and a
conveyor module 400 individually mounted to the same row unit 500. The single-row control
module 202 preferably includes equivalent components to the multi-row control module 200,
except that the downforce signal conditioning chip 206, seed sensor auxiliary input 208, and the
downforce solenoid PWM driver 210 are only in electrical communication with one of the
corresponding devices mounted to the same row unit 500. Additionally, in the alternative
control system 100"' the row bus 250 is in electrical communication with a single drive module
300 and a single conveyor module 400 as well as the single-row control module 202.
[0076]    In still other embodiments, two seed meters 530 are mounted to a single row unit 500 as
described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/838,141. In such embodiments, a drive
module 300 is operably coupled to each seed meter 530. A row network 132' having two drive
modules 300 is illustrated in FIG. 19. The row network 132' preferably includes a single-row
control module 202, a row bus 250, a first drive module 300a (preferably mounted to the row
unit 500), a second drive module 300b (preferably mounted to the row unit 500), a conveyor
module 400, an input controller 307 and an identification power source 309. The first drive
module 300a and the second drive module 300b, including the hardware and software
components, are preferably substantially identical. The single-row control module 202, the first
drive module 300a, the second drive module 300b, and the conveyor module 250 are preferably
in electrical communication with the row bus 250. The single-row control module 202 is
preferably in electrical communication with an implement bus 150 of one of the control system
embodiments described herein. The first drive module 300a is preferably in electrical
communication with the identification power source 309 and the input controller 307. The first
drive module 300a is preferably in electrical communication with the input controller 307 via an
electrical line 311. The identification power source 309 preferably supplies a low-voltage signal
to the first drive module 300a, and may comprise a point-to-point connection to a power source
including a relatively large resistor. The input controller 307 is preferably a swath and/or rate
controller configured to shut off and/or modify an application rate of a crop input such as
(without limitation) liquid fertilizer, dry fertilizer, liquid insecticide, or dry insecticide.

                                                    17
[0077]    During a setup phase of operation of the row network 132', the first drive module 300a
receives a signal from the identification power source 309 and sends a corresponding
identification signal to the monitor 110 (and/or the central processor 120) identifying itself as
the first drive module 300a. Subsequently, the monitor 110 (and/or the central processor 120)
preferably sends commands to the first drive module 300a and stores data received from the first
drive module 300a based on the identification signal.
[0078]    During field operation of the row network 132', the monitor 110 determines which seed
meter 530 should be seeding by comparing position information received from the GPS receiver
166 to an application map. The monitor 110 then preferably commands the single-row control
module 202 to send a desired seeding rate to the drive module associated with the meter 530 that
should be seeding, e.g., the first drive module 300a.
[0079]    In embodiments in which the input controller 307 comprises a swath controller
configured to turn a dry or liquid crop input on or off, the first drive module 300a preferably
sends a command signal to the input controller commanding the input controller to turn off the
associated input, e.g., by closing a valve. In embodiments including only a single seed meter
530 and a single drive module 300 associated with each row unit, the drive module 300
transmits a first signal (e.g., a high signal) via the line 311 to the input controller 307 when the
drive module is commanding the seed meter to plant, and transmits a second signal (e.g., a low
signal) or no signal when the drive module is not commanding the seed meter to plant. The line
311 is preferably configured for electrical communication with any one of a plurality of input
controllers, e.g. by incorporating a standard electrical connector. The first and second signal are
preferably selected to correspond to swath commands recognized by any one of a plurality of
input controllers such that the input controller 307 turns off the crop input when the seed meter
530 is not planting and turns on the crop input when the seed meter 530 is planting.
[0080]    In embodiments in which the input controller 307 comprises a swath controller and in
which each row unit includes two seed meters 530 and associated drive modules 300a, 300b, the
first drive module 300a preferably receives a signal from the row bus 250 (preferably generated
either by the single-row control module 202 or the second drive module 300b) indicating
whether the second drive module is commanding its associated seed meter 530 to plant. The
first drive module 300a then determines whether either the first drive module 300a or 300b is
commanding either of the seed meters 530 to plant. If neither of the drive modules 300a, 300b

                                                  18
are commanding either seed meter to plant, the first drive module 300a preferably sends a first
signal to the input controller 307 via the line 311. The input controller 307 is preferably
configured to turn off the crop input (e.g., by closing a valve) upon receiving the first signal. If
either of the drive modules 300a, 300b are commanding either seed meter to plant the first drive
module 300a preferably sends a second signal (or in some embodiments no signal) to the input
controller 307 such that the input controller does not turn off the crop input.
[0081]   In embodiments in which the input controller 307 comprises a rate controller configured
to modify the application rate of a dry or liquid crop input, the monitor 110 (and/or the central
processor 120) preferably determines a desired crop input application rate and transmits a
corresponding signal to the input controller.
[0082]   Components described herein as being in electrical communication may be in data
communication (e.g., enabled to communicate information including analog and/or digital
signals) by any suitable device or devices including wireless communication devices (e.g., radio
transmitters and receivers).
[0083]   The foregoing description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make
and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its requirements.
Various modifications to the preferred embodiment of the apparatus, and the general principles
and features of the system and methods described herein will be readily apparent to those of
