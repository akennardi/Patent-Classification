                                    FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[0002]       Provided are oils; blends of oils or fatty acids; uses of such blends, including uses as
fuels; and methods of obtaining oils or fatty acids blends.
                               BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[0003]       The following description of the background of the invention is provided simply as an
aid in understanding the invention and is not admitted to describe or constitute prior art to the
invention.
[0004]       Vegetable oils have been used as alternative fuels and feedstocks for the production of
biodiesels. Generally the oils used are extracted from plants grown in large quantity in a particular
region. Therefore, soybean oil is of interest as a source of biodiesel in the United States, whereas
rapeseed oil is of interest in European countries; and countries having tropical climates utilize
coconut oil or palm oil (Knothe et al., published on-line at
www.biodiesel.org/resources/reportsdatabase/reports/gen/19961201_gen-162.pdf).
[0005]       A composition of triglycerides simulating the oil from VS-320, a mutant Cuphea
viscossima, is disclosed by Geller et al. (Transactions of the American Society ofAgricultural
Engineers 42:859-862, 1999). The "simulated analogue of VS-320 oil" disclosed in Geller has a
triglyceride composition of 4.2% C6:0; 40.20% C8:0; 36.90% C10:0; 4.80% C12:0; 6.80% C14:0;
3.33% C16:0; 0.00 % C18:0; 1.37% C18:l; 2.05% C18:2; and 0.00% C18:3 (see Table 1). Geller et
al., (1999) concluded that thishs model suggests that an increase in the C8:0 content of vegetable
oils along with a subsequent reduction in medium- and long-chain triglycerides may result in a
more efficient, better performing alternative diesel fuel."
                                                     1

[0006]        Stournas, et al., (JACOS, 1995, 72:433-437) discloses characteristics of various
oils as fuels and states givenvn the +3*C repeatability of pour point determinations, most of
the added components did not appear to affect the -12"C pour point of the base fuel to a
significant degree. The major exceptions are the saturated fatty alcohols with C12 and longer
alkyl chains, which increase the pour point substantially; minor negative effects were also
observed with some of the longer-chain esters. It is worth noticing that the presence of the
double bond in all oleate derivatives sharply improves their cold flow behavior in comparison
to the corresponding stearates" and "[w]hen both ignition quality and cold flow behavior are
 taken into account, the tertiary dimethylamines are the best performers; however, the tertiary
 amides also appear to be interesting prospects, in that their preparation from the glycerides of
 natural vegetable oils may be much simpler than that of the amines, as some recent studies
 have shown."
  [00071       Mittelbach (BioresourceTechnology, 1996, 56:7-11) discusses specifications and
 quality control of diesel fuel derived from vegetable oils and states "[o]ne parameter which
 has not yet been included in the Austrian standards for RME, but might be necessary when
  defining general standards for fatty acid methyl esters is the iodine number, which describes
  the content of unsaturated fatty acids and is only dependent on the origin of the vegetable oil.
  In Germany a value of 115 is defined, which corresponds to rapeseed oil, but would exclude
  different kinds of oils, like sunflower oil and soybean oil. A limitation of unsaturated fatty
  acids may be necessary, due to the fact that heating higher unsaturated fatty acids results in
  polymerization of glycerides. This can lead to the formulation of deposits or to deterioration
  of the lubricating oil. This effect increases with the number of double bonds in the fatty acid
  chain. Therefore, it seems better to limit the content of higher unsaturated fatty acids like
  linolenic acid, than to limit the degree of unsaturation with the iodine number."
   [00081      Graboski (Prog.Energy Combustion Sci., 1998, 24:125-164) discusses "the
   statues of fat and oil derived diesel fuels with respect to fuel properties, engine performance,
   and emissions" and states "[r]educing chain length and/or increasing chain branching would
   improve the cold flow properties of the fuel. Chain length and degree of branching might be
   altered through both plant breeding or genetic engineering approaches, as well as through
   chemical processing of the biodiesel to cleave certain double bonds or to form branched
                                                     2

isomers. Very little practical research has been done in the chemical processing area. The
cold flow properties of biodiesel fuels are clearly an area in need of considerable research."
 [00091       Goodrum et al., (BioresourceTechnology, 1996, 56:55-60) discusses "physical
properties of low molecular weight triglycerides for the development of bio-diesel fuel
models" and states "[o]ils which contain significant fractions of low molecular weight
 triglycerides might be suitable for direct use as fuel extenders. In fact, feedstock from
 Cuphea species (Graham, 1989), contains oils predominantly composed of these triglycerides
 (particularly tricaprylin and tricaprin). Modem DNA transfer technologies might also afford
 the transfer of genes that control the synthesis of low molecular weight triglycerides from
 species such as Cuphea into other more well-established oilseed crops. Oil composition
 could then be genetically modified for the optimal desired biodiesel properties."
  [0010]       Knothe (Fuel ProcessingTechnology, 2005, 86:1059-1070) states "[s]aturated
 fatty compounds have significantly higher melting points than unsaturated fatty compounds
  (Table 1) and in a mixture they crystallize at higher temperature than the unsaturates. Thus
 biodiesel fuels derived from fats or oils with significant amounts of saturated fatty
  compounds will display higher cloud points and pour points."
  [00111       Kinney et al., (FuelProcessingTechnology, 2005, 86:1137-1147) discusses issues
  regarding modification of soybean oil for enhanced performance biodiesel blends. This
  article references the blends disclosed in Geller et al., 1999 and states "since the melting
  point of biodiesel derived from these short-chain fatty acids is fairly high, additional
  winterization steps would be required to improve cold flow properties." Kinney et al. also
  states "[a]lterations in the fatty acid profile that increase the saturated fatty acid content will
   augment oxidative stability but worsen cold flow . .. the presence of double bonds in fatty
   acids will lower the cetane number; hence, strategies to shift the fatty pool of a vegetable oil
   towards saturated moieties will improve ignition quality of the derived biodiesel, but as with
   oxidative stability may compromise cold flow properties."
   [00121      U.S. Patent No. 4,364,743 ("the '743 patent") discloses "a synthetic fuel of fatty
   acid esters [that] provides a novel source of energy when burned alone or in combination
   with other known fuels," and that "[e]sters are preferably prepared by a transesterification
   reaction using various oils such as soya oil, palm oil , safflower oil, peanut oil, com oil,
                                                     3

cottonseed oil, linseed oil, oiticica oil, tung oil, coconut oil, castor oil, perilla oil, rapeseed
oil, sunflower oil, lard, tallow, fish oils, blubber, lipids from marine and land animals and
lipids from vegetable sources."
100131       U.S. Patent No. 5,389,113 ("the '113 patent") discloses "mixtures containing a) 58
to 95% by weight of at least one ester with an iodine value of 50 to 150 derived from fatty
acids containing 12 to 22 carbon atoms and lower aliphatic alcohols containing I to 4 carbon
atoms, b) 4 to 40% by weight of at least one ester of fatty acids containing 6 to 14 carbon
atoms and lower aliphatic alcohols containing I to 4 carbon atoms and c) 0.1 to 2% by weight

 [00141       US Patent Application Publication No. 2006026963 discloses "nucleic acid
 constructs and methods for producing altered seed oil compositions" and states "a method to
 enhance oleic acid content and reduce saturated fatty acid content in a plant seed comprising
 i) shortening the length of a first heterologous FAD2 sequence until the amount of FAD2
 gene suppression from a plant transformed with the first heterologous FAD2 sequence is at
 least partially reduced relative to the amount of FAD2 gene suppression in a plant cell
 comprising a similar genetic background and a second heterologous FAD2 sequence, wherein
 the second heterologous FAD2 sequence consists of more endogenous FAD2 sequence than
 the first heterologous FAD2 sequence; ii) expressing a heterologous FATB sequence capable
 of at least partially reducing FATB gene expression in a plant cell relative to the suppression
  of FATB in a plant cell with a similar genetic background but without the heterologous

                                SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
  100151      Applicant has determined that blends of vegetable oils can be chosen so that the
  blend exhibits desirable properties for use as alternative fuels or as feedstocks for the
  production of a biodiesel. For example, such blends may be chosen so that, when used as a
  fuel in a cold climate, the blend is less likely to freeze. Blends may also be chosen so that the
                                                     4

blend is stable at higher temperatures. Further, blends may be chosen to achieve desirable
ignition properties when used as a fuel in a vehicle. Some particular examples of features of
the blends of oils or fatty acids of the invention are described below. It is understood that the
blends of oils or fatty acids within the invention may have any combination of the features
described in the below embodiments. In particular the Inventors have determined that
certain mixtures of fatty acids have surprisingly beneficial properties for production of
biofuels. For example, the Inventors have found that particular balances of medium chain
 fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids can have surprisingly beneficial properties, for
 example with respect to cold weather capabilities. In certain embodiments of the fatty acid
 mixtures having balanced amounts of medium chain fatty acids (for example C8, C10 and
 C12) and monounsaturated fatty acids (preferably C16:1 and C18:1), Inventors have found
 that the presence C 16:0 and C18:0 can have particularly unfavorable effects on cold flow
 properties and therefore reduced levels of C16:0 and C18:0 in a biodiesel can be beneficial
 for cold weather capabilities; and that C14:0, C18:2, C18:3, C20, C22 and C24 can also
 adversely effect cold flow properties; thus, reducing these fatty acids in a biodiesel can also
 be beneficial.
  100161      The term "oil" as used herein, refers to a substance composed primarily of
 triglycerides of fatty acids. Vegetable oils may be extracted from various parts of the plant,
  including the seeds, fruit, or leaves of plants. It is generally liquid at room temperatures. In
  some embodiments the oils are derived from canola, rapeseed, palm, palm kernel, coconut,
  tucum, sunflower, safflower, olive, macadamia, babassu, castor, peanut, cotton, flaxseed,
  linseed, cohune, and jatropha. In further embodiments, the oils may be derived from a
  genetically modified plant.
  [00171      Triglycerides are the main constituents of vegetable oils and animal fats.
  Triglycerides may be solid or liquid at room temperature. A triglyceride, also called
  triacylglycerol (TAG), is a chemical compound formed from one molecule of glycerol and
  three fatty acids. Glycerol is a trihydric alcohol (containing three hydroxyl groups) that can
  combine with up to three fatty acids to form monoglycerides, diglycerides, and triglycerides,
  when combined with one, two or three fatty acids, respectively. Monoglycerides,
  diglycerides, and triglycerides are classified as esters, which are compounds created by the
  reaction between acids and alcohols that release water as a by-product. Fatty acids may
                                                    5

combine with any of the three hydroxyl groups to form an ester linkage and create a wide
diversity of compounds. Further, fatty acids having different lengths may combine with an
individual glycerol molecule. Thus the resulting diglyceride or triglyceride may comprise
different fatty acids within the same triglyceride molecule.
[0018]         Fatty acids are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen arranged as a carbon
chain skeleton with a carboxyl group at one end. Fatty acids may be saturated fatty acids
(SFAs) and have no carbon-carbon double bonds, monounsaturated (MUFAs) and have one
carbon-carbon double bond, or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and have more than one
carbon-carbon double bond. The number of carbons in a fatty acid chain and the number of
carbon-carbon double bonds is commonly expressed as "number of carbons : number of carbon
carbon double bonds." For example, oleic acid, which has 18 carbons and one double bond,
can be expressed as "C18:1" or "18:1."
[0019]         "Medium chain fatty acids" as used herein refers to fatty acids containing 6 to 14
carbons, preferably 8 to 12 carbons.
[0020]         "Long chain fatty acids" as used herein refers to fatty acids containing more than
14 carbons, or more that 16 carbons, or even more than 18 carbons.
[0021]         In one aspect, mixtures of fatty acids are provided.

  [00571      In other embodiments of the above aspect of the invention the blends of fatty acids
 or fatty acid alkyl esters are used as a biodiesel and are blended with petroleum-based diesel
 to form a biodiesel blend for use as a fuel. In particular embodiments, the biodiesel
  comprises 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, or even 75% of the biodiesel
 blend, with petroleum-based diesel making up the remainder. The American Society for
 Testing Materials (ASTM) classifies two grades of diesel fuel, #1 diesel fuel and No. 2 diesel
  fuel. In particular embodiments, the biodiesel is blended with #1 diesel fuel, #2 diesel fuel,
  or is blended with a mixture of#1 and #2 diesel.
  [0058]      In another aspect, the invention features a genetically altered plant, wherein the
  plant expresses one or more modified enzymes having one or more mutations such that the
                                                   14

plant produces increased quantities of medium chain fatty acids as compared to the native
plant. In preferred embodiments, the genetically altered plant preferentially produces
medium chain fatty acids having 8, 10, or 12 carbons. As used herein, the term
"preferentially produces medium chain fatty acids having 8, 10, or 12 carbons" means that at
least 50% by weight of the fatty acids produced by the genetically altered plant are medium
chain fatty acids having 8, 10, or 12 carbons; more preferably at least 60%; more preferably
at least 70%; more preferably at least 75%; more preferably at least 80%; more preferably at
least 85%; more preferably at least 90%; more preferably at least 95%; more preferably at
 least 98% by weight of the fatty acids produced by the genetically altered plant are medium
 chain fatty acids having 8, 10, or 12 carbons.
 [0059]       In preferred embodiments of the above aspect of the invention, the genetically
 altered plant is derived from a plant which, in its native state produces an oil having greater
 than 40% long chain fatty acids. In some embodiments the genetically altered plant is
 derived from a native plant that is not a Cuphea species. Cuphea possesses certain traits that
 may be disadvantageous in certain embodiments of the invention. For example, "[w]ildtype
  Cuphea germplasm shatters and, as a consequence, cannot be commercially grown" (Knapp
  et al. "Modifying the seed storage of lipids of Cuphea: A source of medium chain
  triglycerides." In Seed Oilsfor the Future, 142-154, Champaign, Ill., AOCS Press). In
  addition, "it does not tolerate frost, the seeds shatter easily, flowering is unpredictable, and
  the stems, leaves and flowers are covered with sticky elastic hairs... [and] Germination is
  slow (14 to 20 days)" (Ag Innovation News, Jul-Sept. 2003, Vol. 12, No. 3). Moreover,
  obtaining sufficient amounts of oil from Cuphea may hinder the ability to produce sufficient
  amounts of oil to make Cuphea commercially practical. However, in certain embodiments,
  certain other traits of Cuphea may provide an advantageous plant for modification. For
  example, "the plants grow quickly and seeds ripen in only six weeks, making it ideal for
  short-season temperate climates" (Ag Innovation News, Jul-Sept. 2003, Vol. 12, No. 3).
  Accordingly in certain embodiments a genetically altered Cuphea plant is provided that
  produces an oil blend of as disclosed herein.
   [00601      In some embodiments of the above aspect of the invention, the plant expressing
   the modified enzyme is plant is selected from the group consisting of rapeseed, cotton, flax,
   peanut, palm, safflower, soybean, sunflower, castor, and corn. In preferred embodiments the
                                                    15

plant is soybean, more preferably palm, or more preferably castor, or most preferably
rapeseed. In particular embodiments the plant is a species of rapeseed, preferably Brassica
napus, Brassicajuncea, Brassicarapa,Brassica oleracea,Brassicanigra, Brassicacarinata,
and Sinapis alba (Brassicaalba Rabenh.).
[00611       In preferred embodiments of the above aspect of the invention, the mutation
contained is introduced into the enzyme using a gene repair oligonucleobase containing the
mutation.
[00621       A nucleobase comprises a base, which is a purine, pyrimidine, or a derivative or
analog thereof. Nucleosides are nucleobases that contain a pentosefuranosyl moiety, e.g., an
optionally substituted riboside or 2'-deoxyriboside. Nucleosides can be linked by one of
several linkage moieties, which may or may not contain a phosphorus. Nucleosides that are
linked by unsubstituted phosphodiester linkages are termed nucleotides. "Nucleobases" as
used herein include peptide nucleobases, the subunits of peptide nucleic acids, and
morpholine nucleobases as well as nucleosides and nucleotides.
 [00631       An oligonucleobase is a polymer of nucleobases, which polymer can hybridize by
 Watson-Crick base pairing to a DNA having the complementary sequence. An
 oligonucleobase chain has a single 5' and 3' terminus, which are the ultimate nucleobases of
 the polymer. A particular oligonucleobase chain can contain nucleobases of all types. An
 oligonucleobase compound is a compound comprising one or more oligonucleobase chains
 that are complementary and hybridized by Watson-Crick base pairing. Nucleobases are
 either deoxyribo-type or ribo-type. Ribo-type nucleobases are pentosefuranosyl containing
 nucleobases wherein the 2' carbon is a methylene substituted with a hydroxyl, alkyloxy or
 halogen. Deoxyribo-type nucleobases are nucleobases other than ribo-type nucleobases and
 include all nucleobases that do not contain a pentosefuranosyl moiety.
  [00641      An oligonucleobase strand generically includes both oligonucleobase chains and
  segments or regions of oligonucleobase chains. An oligonucleobase strand has a 3' end and a
  5' end. When a oligonucleobase strand is coextensive with a chain, the 3' and 5' ends of the
  strand are also 3' and 5' termini of the chain.
                                                  16

[0065]       The term "gene repair oligonucleobase" is used herein to denote oligonucleobases,
including mixed duplex oligonucleotides, non-nucleotide containing molecules, single
stranded oligodeoxynucleotides and other gene repair molecules as described in detail below.
 [00661       In further embodiments of the above aspect of the invention, the enzyme which is
modified is an acyl-ACP thioesterase. In certain embodiments, the modified acyl-ACP
thioesterase is in a plant selected from the group consisting of rapeseed, cotton, flax, peanut,
palm, safflower, soybean, sunflower, castor, and corn. In preferred embodiments the
 modified acyl-ACP thioesterase is in a variety of rapeseed, preferably Brassicanapus,
 Brassicajuncea,Brassicarapa, Brassicaoleracea,Brassica nigra, Brassica carinata,
 Sinapis alba (Brassica alba Rabenh.), preferably Brassica napus. In particular embodiments,
 the one or more mutations are contained within the region corresponding to amino acid
 residues 91-397 of SEQ ID NO:2; preferably the one or more designed mutations are
 contained in a region selected from the group consisting of amino acid residues 128-147 of
  SEQ ID NO:2, amino acid residues 175-206 of SEQ ID NO:2, amino acid residues 254-297
 of SEQ ID NO:2, amino acid residues 333-335 of SEQ ID NO:2, or amino acid residues 365
  397 of SEQ ID NO:2. In certain preferred embodiments the acyl-ACP thioesterase is
  palmitoyl-ACP thioesterase (PTE).
  [00671       In still further embodiments of the above aspect of the invention, the enzyme
  which is modified is a keto acyl synthase (KAS). In particular embodiments the KAS
  enzyme may be modified so that its activity is decreased or eliminated. In other
  embodiments, the KAS enzyme may be modified so that it substrate selectivity is altered. In
  preferred embodiments, the KAS enzyme is KAS II and the one or more mutations are
  present at positions in a region corresponding to amino acid residues 328-385. In preferred
  embodiments the one or more mutations are present in the region corresponding to amino
  acid residues 325-352 of SEQ ID NO:3 or amino acid residues 355-385 of SEQ ID NO:3. In
  more preferred embodiments, one or more mutations are in the region corresponding to
   amino acid residues 325-340 of SEQ ID NO:3, or even amino acid residues 331-337 of SEQ
   ID NO:3. In some embodiments, the amino acid corresponding to the conserved leucine
   residue at position 337 of SEQ ID NO:3 is mutated.

100681        In another aspect of the invention there are provided transgenic plants comprising
two expressed transgenes encoding acyl-ACP thioesterases, wherein each thioesterase has an
activity towards a different length medium chain fatty acids. Thus, such a transgenic plant
will express both thioesterases and produce a blend of medium chain fatty acids.
                                                                           9
 [0069]        In certain embodiments, the enzyme which is modified is A -stearoyl acyl-ACP

                                                                         9
desaturase is increased. In preferred embodiments, the increase of A -stearoyl acyl-ACP
desaturase activity in the genetically modified plant results in the genetically modified plant
producing increased levels of C16:1 and/or C18:1; and/or decreased levels of C16:0 and/or

 ACP desaturase gene is modified such that it exhibits increased activity with palmitoyl-ACP;
 or in the genetically modified plant is a cotton, flax, peanut, palm, safflower, soybean,
 sunflower, Cuphea, castor or corn.plant and the increased production of C16:0 is achieved by
 transformation of rapeseed with the A9 -stearoyl acyl-ACP gene from macadamia (Macadamia
  integrifolia),sea buckthorn (Hippophaerhamnoides) or cat's claw (Doxantha unguis-cati).
  [00701        In certain embodiments, the enzyme that is modified is Al 2 desaturase (encoded
  by the FAD2 gene). In preferred embodiments the activity or expression of A12 desaturase is
  inhibited or attenuated. In preferred embodiments, the inhibition or attenuation ofA12
  desaturase activity or expression in the genetically modified plant results in the genetically
  modified plant producing decreased levels of C18:2, and/or C18:3; and increased levels of
  C18:1 relative to the native plant.

 oil having less long chain fatty acids than the native plant.
 [00821        In still another aspect of the invention there is provided a method for predicting a
 theoretical melting point of a blend of fatty acid methyl esters. This method computes the
 sum of the product of: the percent (w/w) of an individual fatty acid methyl ester (X), the
 melting point for that ester (MPg), and a factor (F,), for each fatty acid ME contained in the
 blend. Thus, there is a term for each methyl ester corresponding to, for example,
  (X*MPs*F,). The numerical definitions of the melting points and factors used in the method
  can be varied and still produce a valid intermediate value. The term "factor" as used herein
  refers to a constant value corresponding to a fatty acid methyl ester. The factor is multiplied
  with the percent content for that fatty acid ME and the melting point for that fatty acid ME to
  produce a term for that fatty acid ME that is used in the method. For example, individual
  melting points can vary by plus or minus 2 "C, or 5"C, or even 10*C and the individual factors
  may vary by 5% or 10% or even 20% and still produce a valid predicted melting temperature
  for the blend.
   [0083]       In certain embodiments, there is provided a method of predicting the melting point
  of a blend wherein the predicted melting point, PTm, is computed as follows:

100841        In a particular embodiment of the above aspect of the invention, the predicted
melting point is computed as follows:
        PTm= [A(-71.0)(10.0)+         B(-40.0)(4.5)+ C(-18.0)(1.2) + D(5.2)(1.0) + E(19.0)(0.60)

                   57)(0.2) + K(54.5)(10.0) + L(53.0)(2.0) + M(57.4)(2.0)]*(0.01),
and A through M are defined as above.
100851        In a related embodiment of the above aspect, the algorithm is used to identify
blends of fatty acid methyl esters that are suitable for use as a biodiesel wherein the predicted
melting point of the blend is computed and compared to a cut-off value. The "cut-off value"
as used herein refers to a desired melting point, wherein blends having a PTm less than or
equal to that desired melting point are suitable for use as a biodiesel. In particular
embodiments, the cut-off value is 0*C, preferably -5*C, preferably -10*C, preferably -15*C,
preferably -20*C, preferably 0*C, or preferably -20*C.
100861        The term "percent by weight" as used herein refers to the amount of a component
in a blend or mixture. In general this refers to grams of a component per 100 grams of a
mixture. For example a mixture having "10% compound X by weight" refers to 10 grams of
compound X in 100 grams of the mixture.
                                                   24

[00871      The term "biodiesel" as used herein, refers to a fuel derived from vegetable oil or
animal fat. In general, a biodiesel is composed of primarily fatty acid alkyl esters.
Preferably, a biodiesel is suitable for use in an internal combustion engine.
[0088]       The term "biodiesel blend" refers to a fuel that is a blend of a biodiesel and
another fuel. In general, biodiesels are blended with a petroleum-based fuel (i.e.,
petrodiesel). Biodiesel blends are referred to as BXX. The "XX" indicates the amount of
biodiesel in the blend. B 100 is 100% biodiesel or "neat" biodiesel. A B20 blend, for
example, is a 20% volumetric blend of biodiesel with 80% petrodiesel.
[00891       The term "fuel" refers to a substance that is burned to give heat or power.
Examples include liquids such as gasoline, home heating oil, aviation fuel, kerosene, diesel,
biodiesel, vegetable oil, and biodiesel blends. Some fuels, for example, gasoline, diesel,
biodiesel, vegetable oil, or biodiesel blends can be used to power an internal combustion
engine.
 [00901      The phrase "genetically modified plant" refers to a transgenic plant or a
genetically altered plant.
 [0091]      The term "native plant" as used herein refers to a plant that is not genetically
modified (i.e., transgenic or genetically altered). Native plants include wild type plants as
well as plants that have been selectively bred to attain particular characteristics.
 [00921      The phrase "transgenic plant" refers to a plant having a gene from another plant
 species or non-plant species. Such a gene may be referred to as a "transgene."
 [0093]      The phrase "genetically altered plant" refers to a plant having one or more genetic
 modifications, such as transgenes and/or modified enzymes which contain one or more
 designed mutation(s). Such designed mutations may result in a modified enzyme having an
 activity that is different from the native enzyme. Such differences can include differences in
 substrate specificity or level of activity. As used herein, a "transgenic plant" is one type of a
 "genetically altered plant".
  [00941     The phrase "fuel additive" refers to a liquid substance that is added to a fuel,
 comprising less than 5% weight of the final fuel.
                                                  25

[00951      The phrase "mixture of fatty acids" or "blend of fatty acids"'or "fatty acid blend"
may be used interchangeably and refer to a composition that includes various fatty acids. In
certain embodiments a mixture of fatty acids may be an oil or blend of oils, in other
embodiments a mixture of fatty acids may be a mixture of free fatty acids or a mixture of free
fatty acids and an oil or blend of oils. In certain embodiments some or all of the fatty acids in
a mixture of fatty acids may be modified to form fatty acid alkyl esters, for example fatty acid
methyl esters, fatty acid ethyl esters, fatty acid propyl esters and the like. In certain preferred
embodiments, the fatty acid alkyl esters include methyl esters. Accordingly, unless
otherwise indicated the phrase "mixture of fatty acids" as used herein encompasses mixtures
of fatty acid alkyl esters of the fatty acids specified in the mixture. Likewise, unless
otherwise indicated, the term "fatty acid" as used herein includes alkyl esters of the fatty acid.
 100961      The phrase "functional fluid" refers to a liquid substance added to a fuel,
 comprising more than 5% weight of the final fuel.
 [00971      The phrase "freezing point depressant" refers to a liquid substance added to a fuel
 to lower the freezing point of that fuel.
 [00981      The "cetane number" or CN is a measure of fuel ignition characteristics and
 correlates to the ignition delay period. For example, a fuel with a high cetane number starts
 to burn shortly after it is injected into the cylinder (i.e., it has a short ignition delay period).
 Conversely, a fuel with a low cetane number has a longer ignition delay period. Further, a
 higher cetane number correlates with improved combustion, improved cold starting, reduced
 noise, reduced white smoke, and reduced emissions of HC, CO and particulate, particularly
 during early warm-up phase. Commercially available petroleum-derived diesel is generally
  found in two CN ranges: 40-46 for regular diesel, and 45-50 for premium.
  [0099]      The "iodine number" is determined through a standard natural oil assay to
  measure the degree of unsaturation in vegetable oils and fats.
  [001001     The "cloud point" refers to the temperature at which the first wax crystals appear
  and a standardized test protocol from the American Society for Testing and Materials
  (ASTM) is used to determine this temperature.
                                                    26

     [001011      The "pour point" refers to the temperature at which the fuel will
                                                                                         no longer pour.
    The pour point is generally lower than the cloud point. Some engines
                                                                                  will fail to run at the
    cloud point, but generally all engines will fail at the pour point.
    [001021      The "melting point" of a crystalline solid refers to the temperature
                                                                                           at which it
    changes state from solid to liquid. When considered as the temperature
                                                                                    of the reverse change
    (i.e., from liquid to solid), it is referred to as the "freezing
                                                                     point." For most substances, the
   melting and freezing points are equal. The melting point or
                                                                       freezing point is lower than the
   pour point.
   [001031       "Feedstock" as used herein refers to a substance composed of
                                                                                     fats, fatty acids, or
   triglycerides that may be used as a starting material for the preparation
                                                                                  of a biodiesel.
   Examples of feedstocks which may be used in the production of biodiesels
                                                                                       include vegetable
   oil, waste vegetable oil, and animal fats. Other feedstocks include
                                                                              mixtures of fatty acids or
  fatty acid alkyl esters.
   [001041      The term "about" as used herein means in quantitative terms plus
                                                                                         or minus 10%.
  For example, "about 3%" would encompass 2.7-3.3% and "about
                                                                             10%" would encompass 9
  11%.

   [00115]     Oils containing various compositions of medium chain fatty
                                                                                  acids may be blended
   in order to achieve a desired blend of medium chain fatty
                                                                acids. Oils are blended on a by
   weight basis. For example, the volume of rapeseed oil to be
                                                                   used in 100 grams of a blend
  composed of 25 % rapeseed oil is determined by dividing the
                                                                     grams of rapeseed oil in the
  final blend by the specific gravity of rapeseed oil (i.e., 25 gm/0.915gm/mL=27.3mL).
  [001161      Figure 6 is a table containing some exemplary oils and the fatty
                                                                                     acid content
  contained therein. These oils are commercially available from
                                                                      a variety of sources. It is
  noted that the fatty acid content values are expressed as ranges,
                                                                       because, as it is known in the
  art, the amounts of particular fatty acids present in a particular
                                                                     plant, can vary significantly.
  Thus, oils extracted from those plants may exhibit differing quantities
                                                                                of any or all fatty acids
  from batch to batch. Therefore, it is normally necessary to determine
                                                                               the fatty acid content of
 the oils actually used to make blends or a biodiesel.
 [001171      Preparationof FattyAcid A ikyl Esters
[00118]       Fatty acid alkyl esters can be produced from fatty acids or
                                                                              from triglycerides.
Generally, fatty acid alkyl esters are produced by transesterification
                                                                            of the triglycerides in fats
and oils or esterification of free fatty acids (Figure 5). Alternatively,
                                                                             fatty acids may be split
from triglycerides through hydrolysis and subsequently subjected
                                                                        to esterification to produce
the fatty acid ester.
[00119]       Fatty acid alkyl esters may be prepared by a transesterification
                                                                                   reaction of the
triglycerides found in various plant-derived oils such as soybean
                                                                       oil, palm oil, safflower oil,

  peanut oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, linseed oil, coconut
                                                                 oil, castor oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower
  oil, and various oils derived from animal
                                              fats. These oils are reacted with an alcohol
                                                                                                  (e.g.,
  methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol) in the presence
                                                               of a base catalyst such as a sodium
  alkoxide, sodium or potassium hydroxide, or
                                                   titanium tetraisopropoxide. Reaction conditions
  such as temperature and pressure can be selected
                                                         based on the specific alcohol used. The
  amount of catalyst is generally in the range of
                                                    from about 0.1 to about 0.5% by weight based
  on the fatty acid. This process produces a fatty
                                                      acid alkyl ester, wherein the alkyl group is
 derived from the alcohol. Thus, a reaction in
                                                   which methanol was used as the alcohol would
 yield a fatty acid methyl ester. Other by-products

  soybean oil (IN = 130-135) are very susceptible to oxidation while animal fats with

 iodine numbers, such as tallow (IN = 30-48) are much less susceptible. The primary
 drawback of the iodine number is that it does not recognize that some double bonds oxidize
 more readily than others. Methyl linoleate, with two double bonds, will oxidize
 approximately 50 times faster than methyl oleate, with only one double bond. Methyl
 linolenate, with three double bonds, will oxidize even faster, although not by the same

 of increase. Thus, blends of primarily saturated, medium chain fatty acids would be expected
 to have low iodine numbers, and therefore exhibit good oxidative stability.

                                                           synthesized, the methods of the
invention can be practiced with mixed duplex oligonucleotides
                                                                     having two or more types of
RNA-type nucleotides. The function of an RNA segment
                                                              may not be affected by an
 nterruption caused by the introduction of a deoxynucleotide
                                                                 between two RNA-type
trinucleotides, accordingly, the term RNA segment encompasses
                                                                       such as "interrupted RNA
segment." An uninterrupted RNA segment is termed a contiguous
                                                                         RNA segment. In an
alternative embodiment an RNA segment can contain
                                                        alternating RNase-resistant and
                                               36

    unsubstituted 2'-OH nucleotides. The mixed duplex oligonucleotides preferably have
                                                                                               fewer
    than 100 nucleotides and more preferably fewer than 85 nucleotides, but more than
                                                                                           50
   nucleotides. The first and second strands are Watson-Crick base paired. In one embodiment
   the strands of the mixed duplex oligonucleotide are covalently bonded by a linker,
                                                                                          such as a
   single stranded hexa, penta or tetranucleotide so that the first and second strands
                                                                                        are segments
   of a single oligonucleotide chain having a single 3' and a single 5' end. The 3' and
                                                                                         5' ends can
   be protected by the addition of a "hairpin cap" whereby the 3' and 5' terminal nucleotides
                                                                                                   are
   Watson-Crick paired to adjacent nucleotides. A second hairpin cap can, additionally,
                                                                                             be
   placed at the junction between the first and second strands distant from the 3'
                                                                                    and 5' ends, so
   that the Watson-Crick pairing between the first and second strands is stabilized.
   [001521     The first and second strands contain two regions that are homologous with two
  fragments of the target gene, i.e., have the same sequence as the target gene. A homologous
  region contains the nucleotides of an RNA segment and may contain one or more DNA-type
  nucleotides of connecting DNA segment and may also contain DNA-type nucleotides
                                                                                              that are
  not within the intervening DNA segment. The two regions of homology are separated
                                                                                               by,
  and each is adjacent to, a region having a sequence that differs from the sequence of the
 target gene, termed a "heterologous region." The heterologous region can contain one, two
                                                                                                     or
  three mismatched nucleotides. The mismatched nucleotides can be contiguous or
 alternatively can be separated by one or two nucleotides that are homologous with the
                                                                                              target
 gene. Alternatively, the heterologous region can also contain an insertion or one, two, three
 or of five or fewer nucleotides. Alternatively, the sequence of the mixed duplex
 oligonucleotide may differ from the sequence of the target gene only by the deletion of one,
 two, three, or five or fewer nucleotides from the mixed duplex oligonucleotide. The length
 and position of the heterologous region is, in this case, deemed to be the length of the
 deletion, even though no nucleotides of the mixed duplex oligonucleotide are within the
heterologous region. The distance between the fragments of the target gene that are
complementary to the two homologous regions is identically the length of the heterologous
region when a substitution or substitutions is intended. When the heterologous region
contains an insertion, the homologous regions are thereby separated in the mixed
                                                                                       duplex
oligonucleotide farther than their complementary homologous fragments are in the
                                                                                         gene, and
the converse is applicable when the heterologous region encodes a deletion.

   [00153]      The RNA segments of the mixed duplex oligonucleotides are each a part of a
   homologous region, i.e., a region that is identical in sequence to a fragment
                                                                                 of the target gene,
   which segments together preferably contain at least 13 RNA-type nucleotides and preferably
   from 16 to 25 RNA-type nucleotides or yet more preferably 18-22 RNA-type nucleotides
                                                                                                or
  most preferably 20 nucleotides. In one embodiment, RNA segments of the homology regions
  are separated by and adjacent to, i.e., "connected by" an intervening DNA segment. In
                                                                                             one
  embodiment, each nucleotide of the heterologous region is a nucleotide of the intervening
  DNA segment. An intervening DNA segment that contains the heterologous region of
                                                                                            a
  mixed duplex oligonucleotide is termed a "mutator segment."
  [00154]      In another embodiment of the present invention, the gene repair oligonucleobase
  is a single stranded oligodeoxynucleotide mutational vector (SSOMV), which is disclosed
                                                                                                in
  International Patent Application PCT/USOO/23457, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,271,360, 6,479,292, and
  7,060,500 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. The sequence of the SSOMV
                                                                                                 is
  based on the same principles as the mutational vectors described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,756,325;
  5,871,984; 5,760,012; 5,888,983; 5,795,972; 5,780,296; 5,945,339; 6,004,804; and 6,010,907
  and in International Publication Nos. WO 98/49350; WO 99/07865; WO 99/58723; WO
  99/58702; and WO 99/40789. The sequence of the SSOMV contains two regions that are
 homologous with the target sequence separated by a region that contains the desired genetic
 alteration termed the mutator region. The mutator region can have a sequence that is the
 same length as the sequence that separates the homologous regions in the target sequence, but
 having a different sequence. Such a mutator region can cause a substitution.
                                                                                 Alternatively,
 the homologous regions in the SSOMV can be contiguous to each other, while the regions in
 the target gene having the same sequence are separated by one, two or more nucleotides.
 Such a SSOMV causes a deletion from the target gene of the nucleotides that are absent from
 the SSOMV. Lastly, the sequence of the target gene that is identical to the homologous
regions may be adjacent in the target gene but separated by one two or more nucleotides in
the sequence of the SSOMV. Such an SSOMV causes an insertion in the sequence of target
gene.
[00155]       The nucleotides of the SSOMV are deoxyribonucleotides that are linked by
unmodified phosphodiester bonds except that the 3' terminal and/or 5' terminal
internucleotide linkage or alternatively the two 3' terminal and/or 5' terminal internucleotide
                                                 38

   linkages can be a phosphorothioate or phosphoamidate. As
                                                                  used herein an intemucleotide
  linkage is the linkage between nucleotides of the SSOMV
                                                                 and does not include the linkage
  between the 3' end nucleotide or 5' end nucleotide and a
                                                              blocking substituent, see supra. In a
  specific embodiment the length of the SSOMV is between
                                                                 21 and 55 deoxynucleotides and
  the lengths of the homology regions are, accordingly, a total
                                                                   length of at least 20
  deoxynucleotides and at least two homology regions should
                                                                  each have lengths of at least 8
  deoxynucleotides.
  [00156]      The SSOMV can be designed to be complementary to either
                                                                                  the coding or the
 non-coding strand of the target gene. When the desired mutation
                                                                         is a substitution of a single
 base, it is preferred that both the mutator nucleotide be a pyrimidine.

 [002081     The cold temperature properties of vegetable oil derived methyl esters were
improved by the addition of short chain fatty acid methyl esters. Soy oil methyl ester was
solid at -10*C.   When 30% (v/v) C8 methyl ester (methyl octanoate) was added to soy oil
methyl ester, the mixture remained liquid at -1 0*C. When the C8 methyl ester was increased
to 60% (v/v) the mixture remained liquid to -20*C. Addition of CIO methyl ester (methyl
decanoate) had an identical effect on the pour point of soy derived methyl ester. Cold
temperature performance of canola oil derived methyl ester was also improved by

                                               56

 (B 100). Addition of vegetable oil-derived methyl ester to diesel fuel had no observable effect
 on pour points of the mixtures except with the B20 blends. Canola, castor and soy had no
 effect on the B20 pour point, while corn, olive, safflower, sunflower, peanut, palm, and
 coconut all raised the observed pour points of the B20 blends compared to pure diesel fuel.

 Similarly, C16 mixtures with C18:1 dramatically raises the pour

                              Genetically Modified Rapeseed Plant
[00211]     A rapeseed plant is genetically modified to produce an oil with a desirable balance
of medium chain fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids as discussed herein, namely the
rapeseed plant is genetically modified to have relatively increased levels of short/medium
chain fatty acids; relatively increased levels of monounsaturated C16:0 and C18:0 fatty acids;
and relatively decreased levels of polyunsaturated C18:2 and C18:3 fatty acids. The
following genetic modifications are performed: (1) The activity of Al2 desaturase is reduced
by using gene repair oligonucleotide bases to introduce a stop codon in the coding sequence
of the FAD2 gene to decrease the level of linolenic acid (18:3) and linoleic acid (18:2) as
well as increase the level of oleic acid (18:1); (2) the activity of the A9-stearoyl acyl-ACP
desaturase gene is modified by transforming the rapeseed plant with the A9 -stearoyl acyl-ACP
gene from macadamia (Macadamiaintegrifolia),to increase the levels of palmitoleic acid
(16:1); (3) the activity of keto acyl-ACP synthase (KASII) is reduced by using gene repair
oligonucleotide bases to introduce a stop codon in the coding sequence of the KASII gene;
(4) the substrate specificity of the the palmitoyl thioesterase (PTE) is altered to increase
activity with capryloyl-ACP (C8), caproyl-ACP (C10), and lauroyl-ACP (C12) and in turn
increase the levels of short and medium chain fatty acids by transforming the rapeseed plant
with an Cuphea acyl-ACP thioesterase gene having short chain length specificity. The
genetically modified rapeseed plant produces an oil having the following fatty acid
composition: C8 accounts for about 5% of the oil; C10 accounts for about 5% of the oil; C12
