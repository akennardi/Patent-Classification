                                           ABSTRACT
   A plurality of electronic gaming machines (10) are connected to a network (11), to
   which a feature jackpot controller (12) and display means (13) are also connected.
 5 Each of the electronic gaming machines (10) are provided with a network interface
   arranged to provide a signal onto the network (11) on each occurrence of an operation
   of a respective machine and the jackpot controller (12) is arranged to receive each of
   the machine operation signals and to increment the value of a random jackpot prize on
   the occurrence of each of these operation signals. Prior to each game, the gaming
10 machine (10) selects a random number from a range of numbers and during each
   game, the machine allocates the first n numbers in the range, where n is the number of
   credits bet by the player in that game. At the end of the game, the randomly selected
   number is compared with the numbers allocated to the player and if a match occurs the
   particular machine is switched into a feature game mode in which a jackpot game is
15 played for all or part of the incremental jackpot prize.

   Field
15          The present invention relates to apparatus for use with a system of linked poker
   machines and in particular the apparatus provides an improved jackpot mechanism for
   use with such a poker machine system.
   Background of the Invention
20          Many schemes have been devised in the past to induce players to play slot
   machines including schemes such as specifying periods during which jackpot prizes
   are increased or bonus jackpots paid. Other schemes involve awarding an additional
   prize to a first player to achieve a predetermined combination on a poker machine.
   These methods, while effective, add to club overheads because of the need for
25 additional staff to ensure that the scheme is operated smoothly.
            More recently, with the advent of poker machines linked through electrical
   networks it has been possible to automatically generate jackpot prizes on the basis of
   information received from the machines being played which are connected to the
   system and one such prior art arrangement, commonly known as "Cashcade TM"
30 counts turnover on all machines in the network, increments a prize value in accordance
   with the turnover and pays the jackpot prize when the count reaches some
   predetermined and randomly selected number. In a more recent prior art arrangement,
   each game played on each machine in a gaming system is allocated a randomly
   selected number and the prize is awarded to a machine when the game number it is
35 allocated matches a preselected random number.
                                                                     10315940_1 (GHMatters) P88074.AU.1 0 4/06/18

                                                  2
            In another recent prior art arrangement, the winning machine is
   selected by randomly selecting a number at a point in time and decrementing the
   number as games played on the system are counted until the number is decremented
   to zero at which time the game (or associated machine) causing the final decrement is
 5 awarded the jackpot.
           With some prior art combination based trigger arrangements there is a serious
   disadvantage in that the player betting a single token per line, is just as likely to
   achieve a jackpot as the player playing multiple tokens per line. This has the effect of
   encouraging players playing for the bonus jackpot to bet in single tokens, rather than
10 betting multiple tokens per game.
           Jackpot games have traditionally been popular in Casinos. However, in their
   conventional format these games have inherent limitations:
           (i) Games which use specific combinations of symbols to trigger jackpots are
   perceived by many players as being unwinnable. The games are typically designed in
15 such a way that the big jackpots should not be won until large amounts are
   accumulated. With such low frequency the jackpots are never seen to be won by most
   players. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many players have learnt to disregard the
   chance of winning the major jackpots and are realistically playing for the lesser
   jackpots (ie the minor and mini jackpots). The increasing popularity of small mystery
20 jackpots with higher frequencies of occurrence tends to support this argument;
           (ii) Due to the increasing demand of players for a more complex and diverse
   game range, conventional jackpot games with combination triggers have become
   superseded. However, it is extremely complex to develop a wide variety of
   combinations which support both a feature game and mathematically exact jackpot
25 triggers;
           (iii) Typically, it would be expected that the game return (RTP) is independent
   of the number of coins bet per line. With conventional progressive jackpot games
   though, increasing the credits bet per line creates a relative disadvantage as far as
   RTP is concerned. Let's say the start-up amount for a feature jackpot is $10000. A
30 player who is playing 1 credit per line has a chance for $10000 for each credit played,
   whereas a player playing 5 credits per line only has a chance for $2000 for each credit
   played. This creates a scale of diminishing returns. The smart player who gambles for
   the feature jackpot only, will always cover all playlines, but will only bet 1 credit
   per line because the prize paid for the feature jackpot is the same irrespective of the
35 bet. This is supported by data collected from casinos,
                                                                   10315940_1 (GHMatters) P88074.AU.1 0 4/06/18

                                                    3
            (iv)Typical combination triggered progressive jackpots have fixed hit rates
   which removes from the operator's control the ability to vary jackpot frequency.
            These arrangements have been in use in the State of New South Wales and in
   other jurisdictions for a considerable period of time, however, as with other aspects of
 5 slot machine games, players become bored with such arrangements and new and
   more innovative schemes become necessary in order to stimulate player interest.
            In this specification, the term "combinations" will be used to refer to the
   mathematical definition of a particular game. That is to say, the combinations of a
   game are the probabilities of each possible outcome for that game.

   Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments
            In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a new jackpot trigger mechanism
   provides the Casino operator with a far higher degree of flexibility. Unlike conventional
   combination triggered jackpots, the jackpots here are won from a feature game. The
 5 feature game is triggered randomly as a function of credits bet per game. When a
   feature is triggered, a feature game appears. Each jackpot can only be won from this
   feature game. During the feature game a second set of reel strips appears and a "spin
   and hold" feature game commences. The feature prize score is calculated by the total
   of the points appearing on the centre line of all 5 reels.
10         Feature jackpots in this format exhibit significant differences over previous
   jackpot systems:
           (i)      A jackpot game is provided which is compatible with any existing game
   combination within an installation independent of the platform, denomination or type of
   game (e.g. slot machines, cards, keno, bingo or pachinko). This will allow for the
15 linking of combinations between game type, platform type and denomination. Using
   this system, jackpot games can now be developed using specific combinations for the
   base game which were previously unsuitable for Link Progressive Systems. These
   games will compete with the appeal of the latest games on the market.
           (ii) There is no longer a need to develop mathematically exact combinations in
20 the base game.
           (iii) Unlike the multiplier game in combination triggered jackpot embodiments,
   the present invention provides a direct relationship between the number of credits bet
   and the probability of winning the jackpot feature game on any one bought game.
   Betting 10 credits per line will produce ten times as many hits into the feature game
25 than betting 1 credit per line. This is achieved by using a jackpot trigger which is
   directly related to the wager bet on a respective game and the turnover, instead of
   using conventional combination triggers.
           (iv)Jackpot hit rates can now be changed without making changes to the base
   game. This was previously not possible using combination triggered jackpots.
30         (v) The jackpot feature system can be used across a wide-area-network (WAN),
   local-area-network (LAN), used as a stand-alone game independent of a network or
   used with a mystery jackpot. Flexibility is available to change combinations at will.
           Referring to Figure 1 a plurality of electronic gaining consoles 10 are connected
   to a network 11, to which a feature jackpot controller 12 and display means 13 are also
35 connected.
                                                                    10315940_1 (GHMatters) P88074.AU.1 0 4/06/18

                                                  6
           Each of the electronic gaming consoles 10 are provided with a network
   interface arranged to provide a signal onto the network 11 on each occurrence of an
   operation of a respective console and the jackpot controller 12 is arranged to receive
   each of the console operation signals and to increment the value of a random jackpot
 5 prize on the occurrence of each of these operation signals.
           A flow chart for a prize awarding algorithm is illustrated in Figure 2.
           Referring to the algorithm of Figure 2, machine contributions go into the prize
   pool as with known prior art jackpot systems, while the overhead display shows the
   incrementing prize value.
10          In the EGM, an average value of machine turnover between jackpot hits, is
   programmed and is used to randomly generate trigger data for the jackpot feature
   games. In step 20 of the algorithm of Figure 2, the actual number range and therefore
   probability of a feature jackpot game being awarded will depend upon the value of a
   credit in the particular machine and is calculated by dividing the turnover value by the
15 value of a credit (e.g. $5000/$0.05 = 100,000). The average turnover value is fixed for
   the EGMs and the random number generator is initialised (see step 20) at startup to
   generate numbers from the preprogrammed range determined from that value.
           For every game that is played, a random trigger value is selected (see step 21)
   in the preprogrammed range as determined from the average turnover value. When
20 the game is commenced, it is then reported (see step 22) to the controller, which
   allocates a contribution to the prize pool. Each game is also allotted (see step 23)
   numbers from the same number range that from which the random number was
   selected, one number in the range being allotted for each credit bet such that the
   player's probability of being awarded a jackpot feature game is proportional to the bet.
25         The previously selected random number is then used as a trigger value and
   compared with the values allotted to the player, if there is a match (see step 24)
   between the trigger value and the player values, the player is given an opportunity to
   play a jackpot feature game (see step 25). Alternatively, at step 23, a number is
   allocated which is equal to, or proportional to the number of credits bet in the
30 respective game and in step 24, the trigger value is compared with the single player
   value and a jackpot feature awarded if the trigger value is less than or equal to the
   player value. It will be appreciated that this alternative arrangement is mathematically
   equivalent to the previously described arrangement, the range of numbers below the
   allotted number in the alternative arrangement being equivalent to the set of allotted
35 numbers in the previously described arrangement.
                                                                    10315940_1 (GHMatters) P88074.AU.1 0 4/06/18

                                                     7
              In the preferred embodiment, a prize is always awarded in the jackpot feature
    game, the feature game being used to determine the size of the prize to be awarded
    (see step 27). The winning machine is then locked up (see step 28) and the controller
    awaits an indication that the prize has been paid before allowing the machine to be
  5 unlocked (see step 29). In some embodiments, the machine will not be locked up in
    steps 28 and 29, but instead the prize will simply be paid and the program will return to
    step 21. The machine then returns to step (see step 21) and commences a new game.
    If the trigger value does not match (see step 27) then there is no feature game
    awarded for that bought game and the machine returns to step (see step 22) and waits
10  for the next game to commence.
              By way of example, a feature game might be triggered by an EGM every $5000
    of turnover played, which is equivalent to 100,000 credits on a $0.05 machine. This is
    referred to as the jackpot feature game hit rate in credits. A random number is
    generated within a prescribed range of numbers at the EGM at the commencement of
15  each bought game. The prescribed range of numbers is determined by the jackpot
    feature game hit rate which has been determined previously, from typical values of
    casino turnover, expected jackpot amounts and jackpot frequencies. The prescribed
    range in this example is therefore 1 to 100,000 and before the commencement of each
    bought game a random number is generated within this range.
20           A bet of 20 credits will result in the numbers between 1 and 20 (inclusive) being
    allotted to the game (note that statistically it does not matter if the numbers are
    randomly selected or not or allotted as a block or scattered, the probability of a feature
    game being awarded is unchanged). If the number 7 is produced by the random
    number generator, then the feature game will be triggered. If any number between 21
25  and 100,000 is produced by the random number generator, the feature game will not
    be triggered. Similarly, a bet of 200 credits will result in the numbers between 1 and
    200 (inclusive) being allotted to the game. If any number between 1 and 200 is
    produced by the random number generator, then the feature game will be triggered. If
    any number between 201 and 100,000 is produced by the random number generator,
30  the feature game will not be triggered.
              The example below has been developed using example turnover data.
    A trigger of the second screen feature game is expected every $5000 of turnover (ie.
    100000 credits on a $0.05 machine). Increasing the number of credits bet increases
    the chance of triggering the feature on any bought game.

             Preferably, when a jackpot feature game is triggered, all players are alerted by
   a jackpot bell that a possible grand jackpot is about to be played for. This is done so
 5 that all players share in the experience of a jackpot win. Anecdotal evidence of players
   watching feature games being played in Australian casinos suggests that the drawing
   power of such games is immense.
             Players are alerted by the jackpot bell instantaneously at any point during a
   game, but the feature game will not appear until the current game (including base
io game features) are completed.
             In this embodiment the feature game appears with the new reel strips already
   spinning and accompanying feature game tunes playing. The player stops the reels
   spinning by pressing the corresponding playline buttons in order. The feature prize
   score is calculated by the total of the points appearing on the centre line of all 5 reels.
15 Across the top of the screen, a sum of the scores is displayed.
   The 4 feature prize meters in descending order of value are:
       (i) Grand Feature Prize. A score of > 100 wins the grand feature jackpot;
       (ii) Major Feature Prize. A score of 90-99 (inclusive) wins the major feature
                 jackpot;
20     (iii) Minor Feature Prize. A score of 80-89 (inclusive) wins the minor feature
                 jackpot;
       (iv) Mini Feature Prize. A score of < 79 wins the mini feature jackpot.
                                                                   10315940_1 (GHMatters) P88074.AU.1 0 4/06/18

                                                  9
        By way of example, referring to Figure 3, a 5 reel by 3 row window is displayed. If
   the reels of the feature game stop on the numbers shown in Figure 3, then the
   progressive jackpot won is the sum of the numbers on the centre line ie.
    12+10+18+13+22 = 75 which is within the range for the mini feature jackpot.
 5      The instant the feature game is completed and the sum of scores from all 5 reels is
   shown, the feature jackpot screen and signs display which jackpot has been won. This
   celebration of the jackpot win is conducted in a traditional manner (i.e. flashing
   displays, jackpot alarms, music etc).
        As the time between jackpot game awards is related to turnover, the number of
10 jackpot games played by a player between feature games and hence their chance of
   winning is directly related to the size of each bet on each game played.
   (1)      All machines on the link have a feature game, be it a second screen animation
   game or a second set of reel strips.
   (2)       The link has a number of feature jackpot meters (up to 8). All feature jackpots
15 may be linked.
   (3)       The feature game is activated as a function of machine turnover. This means
   that on average the feature game will occur one in, for example every $5000.00. There
   are a number of advantages of activating the feature game on turnover. For example, it
   enables for the first time, a relatively simple mechanism for allowing mixed
20 denomination on a link. The feature game gives the player the chance of winning one
   of the available feature jackpots if a certain outcome appears. For example, a new set
   of reel strips might appear with only 2 or 4 different symbols: Jackpot 1, Jackpot 2, or
   (Jackpot 1, Jackpot 2, Jackpot 3, Jackpot 4). The first time 5 of the same appear on
   the centre line the stated feature jackpot is won.
25 (4)      Another advantage of using a random trigger for a feature game, is that it can
   be applied to any game.
             It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations
   and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific
   embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly
30 described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as
   illustrative and not restrictive.
