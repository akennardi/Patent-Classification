            A Peanut-specific Fertilizer Prepared from Peanut Stalks and Its Preparation Method
[0001] BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Technical Field
The present invention relates to the technical field of crop fertilizers, and more specifically, to a peanut
specific fertilizer prepared from peanut stalks and its preparation method.
[0002] 2. Description of the Related Art
In recent years, crop stalks have become new sources of diffused pollution in rural areas, especially the
burning of crop residues in fields has caused severe pollution to the air. As a large agricultural country,
it can produce over 700 million tons of stalks every year in China. As a large peanut-producing country,
China yielded over 16 million tons of peanuts in total in 2016. The yield ratio of peanut stalks and
peanut pods is about 1:1, i.e. the yield of peanut stalks in China is over 16 million tons. Due to the
autotoxicity of peanut stalks, continuous cropping in peanut fields will be affected if the stalks are
returned to the fields, causing poor development of peanut plants and significantly reducing the yields.
Proper treatment of peanut stalks will contribute to the development of the peanut planting industry.
[0003] Peanut seedlings require a certain amount of calcium nutrition to increase their stress resistance.
In the later stages of development, pods require a large amount of calcium for development, but there is
insufficient exchangeable calcium in the soil, which easily causes empty grains and greatly affects the
yield. What badly needs to be solved are to provide sufficient calcium fertilizers for peanuts through a
single fertilization and improve the efficiency of fertilizers. Existing peanut-specific calcium fertilizers are
not well-targeted, and most of the calcium is directly applied to the soil, so it easily causes the
solidification or loss of calcium and the timely efficiency of the fertilizers cannot be fully used.
[0004] BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
To solve problems such as the pollution caused by peanut stalks, failure to meet the needs for calcium
fertilizers in different stages of peanuts by a single fertilization, low fertilizer efficiency and incomplete
use of the timely efficiency of the fertilizers, the present invention provides a peanut-specific fertilizer
prepared from peanut stalks. The fertilizer (charred-peanut-stal ks-integrated-with-nano-calci um-specific
fertilizer) is made by charring peanut stalks and integrating nano-calcium into the charred stalks It has
good effects and effectively increases the yield and improves the quality of peanuts.
[0005] The present invention also provides a method for preparing the peanut-specific fertilizer
prepared from peanut stalks.
[0006] The present invention adopts the following technical solution to realize the aims described above:
The present invention provides a peanut-specific fertilizer prepared from peanut stalks. The specific
fertilizer is made from the following parts (by weight) of raw materials: 40-50 parts of charred peanut
stalks, 10-15 parts of nano-calcium carbonate and 5-8 parts of wheat malt flours.
[0007] The present invention also provides a method for preparing the peanut-specific fertilizer which
includes the following steps:
(1) crush peanut stalks into powder with a size of <600 meshes using a stalk crusher, immerse it in a
mixed solution for 40-50 min, wash with water and dry at a temperature of 70-800 C; slowly heat the
                                                         1

                                          Specification
stalk powder to a temperature of 3000C, maintain at that temperature for 3 hours for charring, and then
slowly reduce the temperature to below 1500C; take out the charred substances, immerse in dilute
hydrochloric acid for 2-3 hours, and wash with water to be neutral; add tetrabutyl titanate drop by drop
while stirring, continue stirring for 1.5 hours after completion of the addition, dry the mixture at a
temperature of 70-800C to obtain charred peanut stalks;
(2) add wheat into green tea water, immerse for 3-4 hours to allow it to germinate; stop the germination
when over 85% of the wheat malt is longer than 1cm, grind the germinated wheat, dry, regrind, and
allow it to go through a sifter with a size of 60 meshes to obtain wheat malt flour;
(3) suspend nano-calcium carbonate in the water, stir until a homogeneous suspension is obtained (the
mass ration of nano-calcium carbonate to water is 1:10); add the charred peanut stalks and the wheat
malt flours; stir the solution for 2-3 hours to mix them well, and then dry at a temperature of 70-800C.
[0008] Further, the mixed solution is made from dipotassium glycyrrhizinate, sodium polyacrylate and
water.
[0009] The mass ratio of the dipotassium glycyrrhizinate, sodium polyacrylate and water above is
1:2:100.
[0010] Further, the amount of tetrabutyl titanate added is 2-3% of the charred substances.
[0011] The green tea water used in the present invention is prepared using the following method: add a
mixture of glycerol and water 10 times heavier than the green tea (the volume ratio of glycerol and
water is 1:20) into green tea, heat to a temperature of 50-600C, maintain at that temperature for 1-2
hours, and filter.
[0012] The fertilizer is based on peanut stalks, wherein the peanut stalks are charred and nano-calcium
are absorbed in the charred substances, thus not only realizing maintaining the calcium for a long time,
but also realizing continuous supply of calcium nutrition and therefore meeting the need of peanut pods
for calcium fertilizers in the later stages of development through absorption of the biochar in accordance
with the features of calcium needs in different development stages of peanuts; besides, the utilization
rate of calcium fertilizers is increased thanks to the characteristic that nano-calcium is easily absorbed;
since the charring of peanut stalks contributes to the elimination of the autotoxicity of peanut stalks, and
the charred stalks have a large specific surface area and more porous structures which provide better
absorption characteristics, so the main ingredients also include H, 0, N, S and a small amount of
microelements besides the Ca element which can provide complete nutrition for crops, increase the
content of organic matter in soil and improve the physical and chemical properties and the bioactivity of
the soil. Not only harmless treatment and returning of peanut stalks to fields, but also reduction of
carbon emissions and improvement of soil fertility are realized through the stalk charring. The present
invention has a simple formulation, but it is practical, reasonable and of good effect. It can obviously
increase the utilization rate of fertilizers, thus increasing the yield and improving the quality of peanuts
and increasing the economic benefits of peanuts.
[0013] The nano-calcium used in the present invention is a commercial product.
[0014] The present invention has the following beneficial effects:
1. Peanut stalks are returned to fields without harm through the charring of peanut stalks. The stalks
                                                        2

                                        Specification
with a large amount of nutrient elements can provide complete nutrition for crops, increase the content
of organic matter in soil and improve the physical and chemical properties and the bioactivity of the soil.
The tetrabutyl titanate is introduced to enhance the absorption of calcium;
2. The utilization rate of the calcium fertilizer is increased, and the soil can maintain the efficiency of the
calcium fertilizer thanks to the good adsorbability of biochar through the integration of nano-calcium and
charred stalks, slowing the release and meeting the need for calcium fertilizers in the later stages of
peanut development;
3. Peanut stalks in production are charred as raw materials, so no pollution is caused to the
environment and crops. The integration of nano-calcium and biochar makes returning of peanut stalks
to fields and release of the nutrition of calcium fertilizers more reasonable, provides better effects,
significantly increases the utilization rate of fertilizers, and increases the yield and improves the quality
of peanuts.
[0015] 4. A proper amount of wheat malt flour is added to enhance the capacity of the fertilizer and
promote the growth and development of peanuts while keeping the fertilizer stable.

From the experiments above, we can see that the charred-peanut-stalks-integrated-with-nano-calcium
specific fertilizer not only can meet the nutrition needs of peanuts in different development stages and
promote the better growth of peanuts, but also reduce the amount of fertilizers applied, thus saving the
cost and effectively reducing carbon emissions.

                                                 Claims
What is claimed is:
1. A peanut-specific fertilizer prepared from peanut stalks, characterized in that the specific fertilizer is
made from the following parts (by weight) of raw materials: 40-50 parts of charred peanut stalks, 10-15
parts of nano-calcium carbonate and 5-8 parts of wheat malt flour.
2. A method for preparing the peanut-specific fertilizer as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the
method includes the following steps:
(1) crush peanut stalks into powder with a size of <600 meshes using a stalk crusher, immerse in a
mixed solution for 40-50 min, wash with water and dry at a temperature of 70-80'C; slowly heat the
stalk powder to a temperature of 3000C, maintain at that temperature for 3 hours for charring, and then
slowly reduce the temperature to below 1500C; take out the charred substances, immerse in dilute
hydrochloric acid for 2-3 hours, and wash with water to be neutral; add tetrabutyl titanate drop by drop
while stirring, continue stirring for 1.5 hours after completion of the addition, dry the mixture at a
temperature of 70-80'C to obtain charred peanut stalks;
(2) add wheat into green tea water, immerse for 3-4 hours to allow it to germinate; stop the germination
when over 85% of the wheat malt is longer than 1cm, grind the germinated wheat, dry, regrind, and
allow it to go through a sifter with a size of 60 meshes to obtain wheat malt flour;
(3) suspend nano-calcium carbonate in the water, stir until a homogeneous suspension is obtained; add
the charred peanut stalks and the wheat malt flour; stir the solution for 2-3 hours to mix them well, and
then dry at a temperature of 70-80'C.
3. The preparation method as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that the mixed solution is made from
dipotassium glycyrrhizinate, sodium polyacrylate and water.
4. The preparation method as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that the mass ratio of the
dipotassium glycyrrhizinate, sodium polyacrylate and water above is 1:2:100.
5. The preparation method as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that the amount of tetrabutyl titanate
added is 2-3% of the charred substances.
