[0001]       The present application is a divisional application from Australian Patent
Application No. <removed-apn>, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
reference.
                                      FIELD OF USE
[0002]       Embodiments of various embodiments herein relate to vehicle control.
Other embodiments relate to vehicle control based on a determined vehicle
orientation.
                                     BACKGROUND
[0003]       A vehicle "consist" is a group of two or more vehicles that are coupled or
linked together to travel along a route. The vehicles may be logically linked (e.g.,
coordinated wireless control), or they may be mechanically linked by way of couplers,
hitches, or the like. In certain vehicle consists, it may be the case that the vehicles are
coupled in different orientations, that is, the vehicles are oriented differently from one
another such that they face different directions. Especially in cases where the vehicles
are configured to operate bi-directionally (e.g., forwards and backwards), it may be
necessary to determine how the vehicles are oriented, prior to the consist moving, to
avoid situations (for example) where one vehicle is motoring in one direction and a
linked vehicle is motoring in the opposite direction.
[0004]       As one example, in a consist of locomotives or other rail vehicles, control
inputs of a control subsystem of the consist (e.g., distributed power control) may
include the respective orientations of the rail vehicles in the consist relative to a lead
vehicle of the consist and/or a direction of travel of the consist. In a rail context, such
orientations may include "short hood forward" (e.g., operator cab or front end of the
vehicle is facing the lead vehicle and/or direction of travel) or "long hood forward"
(e.g., operator cab or front end of the vehicle is facing away from the lead vehicle or
direction of travel). Further information about rail vehicle orientation, and control
schemes relating thereto, are found in U.S. Pat. No. 6490523, issued December 3,
2002, and in U.S. Publication No. 2009/0248226, dated October 1, 2009, both of
which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.
                                              1

[0005]       Existing systems for determining vehicle orientation involve either manual
data entry (e.g., an operator determining the orientation of each vehicle and entering
data into a control subsystem) or complex signaling or communication schemes. The
former is time consuming and prone to error, and the latter may add significant
complexity and cost to a vehicle. Therefore, it may be desirable to provide a vehicle,
system, and method of vehicle control that differ from existing systems and methods.
                                  BRIEF DESCRIPTION
[0006]       In an embodiment, a vehicle includes a chassis, a first network bus, and a
second network bus. The first network bus extends from internally in the chassis
(e.g., at a location where a network circuit may be connected to the bus) to a first
network port attached externally to the chassis. The first network port is positioned in
association with a first orientation of the vehicle, e.g., the front end of the vehicle.
The second network bus extends from internally in the chassis to a second network
port attached externally to the chassis. The second network port is positioned in
association with a different, second orientation of the vehicle, e.g., the rear end of the
vehicle. The first network bus has a first electrical configuration and the second
network bus has a second electrical configuration that is different than the first
electrical configuration.
[0007]       According to an alternative embodiment, the provision of different
electrical configurations in association with the different orientations allows a control
subsystem of an adjacent vehicle, when coupled to the first network bus or the second
network bus (e.g., by way of a detachable network cable that extends between the
vehicles), to determine how the vehicles are oriented relative to one another. For
example, the control subsystem may include a network circuit that is configured to
determine the electrical configurations of network buses attached to it. Based on the
determined electrical configuration in a given instance, the control subsystem can
determine the vehicle orientation.
[0008]       As one example, the network buses may be Ethernet cables or other
Ethernet buses, and the networks ports may be Ethernet ports. (The buses are used, in
conjunction with routers, hubs, switches, or other network circuits, to communicate
data, e.g., for vehicle control purposes.) One of the Ethernet buses is configured in an
Ethernet crossover configuration, and the other is configured in an Ethernet straight
through configuration. Plural vehicles in a transportation system may be similarly
configured, for example, in each vehicle an Ethernet crossover bus extends to an
                                             2

Ethernet port at the front or rear of the vehicle, and an Ethernet straight-through bus
extends to an Ethernet port at the other of the front or rear of the vehicle. Whenever
one vehicle is coupled to an adjacent vehicle for network data communications, the
one vehicle can determine which end of the adjacent vehicle is attached to it by
determining the presence of the Ethernet crossover bus or the Ethernet straight
through bus.

                               DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0015]      The following detailed description of certain embodiments will be better
understood when read in conjunction with the appended drawings. To the extent that
the figures illustrate diagrams of the functional modules of various embodiments, the
functional blocks are not necessarily indicative of the division between hardware
circuitry. Thus, for example, one or more of the functional blocks (e.g., processors or
memories) may be implemented in a single piece of hardware (e.g., a general purpose
signal processor or a block of random access memory, hard disk, or the like).
Similarly, the programs may be stand-alone programs, may be incorporated as
subroutines in an operating system, may be functions in an installed software package,
and the like. It should be understood that the various embodiments are not limited to
the arrangements and instrumentality shown in the drawings.
                                             3

[0016]      In various embodiments, a plurality of vehicles within a transportation
network (e.g., automobiles that travel along a road system, or rail vehicles that travel
throughout a network of track) are outfitted with onboard data networks. Each
vehicle includes respective first and second externally-accessible network busses for
detachably connecting the network buses to adjacent vehicles for inter-vehicle data
communications. The first network buses have one electrical configuration and are
associated with one common or corresponding orientation of the vehicles (e.g., front
end or rear end). The second network buses have a different electrical configuration
and are associated with a different common or corresponding orientation of the
vehicles (e.g., the other of the front or rear end). Each vehicle also includes a control
subsystem having a network circuit. The network circuit is connected to the vehicle's
network buses, and is configured, when the vehicle is coupled to an adjacent vehicle
for data communications, to determine the electrical configuration of the adjacent
vehicle's network bus to which the network circuit is coupled. Based on the
determined electrical configuration, the control subsystem can determine how the
adjacent vehicle is oriented, such as which end of the adjacent vehicle is attached.
The vehicles may be controlled for movement along a route based on the determined
vehicle orientations.
[0017]      FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of a vehicle network system 128. The
vehicle network system 128 may include one or more vehicles 100. The vehicle 100
includes a chassis 102, a first network bus 104, and a second network bus 106. The
chassis 102 is a frame and/or body and/or platform for supporting the components of
the vehicle, which can include an operator cab 108, wheels 110, a propulsion system
112 (e.g., one or more engines, motors, alternators, generators, brakes, batteries,
turbines, and/or the like), and/or the like. Optionally, the vehicle 100 may be a marine
vessel. For example, the chassis may be or include a hull of the marine vessel.
[0018]      Each of the network buses 104 and 106 may include one or more electrical
conductors for communicating network data along the respective network bus 104,
106. The network data may include data configured in packet form (e.g., data packets
that comprise respective sets or frames of associated data bits, and/or the like) and that
may be addressed to one or more recipient devices or vehicles 100 within the vehicle
control subsystem 128.
[0019]      Additionally or alternatively, the first and second network buses 104 and
106 may each include a plurality of electrical conductors. For example, the network
                                               4

buses 104 and 106 may be Ethernet buses (e.g., according to the 10BASE-T,
100BASE-T, 1000BASE-T, 10GBASE-T, and/or the like Ethernet standards) each
having eight respective electrical conductors, such as Ethernet cables (e.g., category
5e (cat 5E) cables, category 6 (cat 6) cables, category 6a (cat 6a) cables, and/or the
like). In various embodiments, the first network bus 104 is configured having a first
electrical configuration 124 (shown in Figure 3), and the second network bus 106 is
configured having a second electrical configuration 126 (shown in Figure 4) that is
different than the first electrical configuration.
[0020]       The first network bus 104 extends internally within the chassis 102 from a
network circuit 132 to a first network port 114. The first network bus 104 is operably
attached to the first network port 114. For example, the first network bus 104 may be
electrically coupled to the first network port 114. The first network port 114 may be
attached externally to the chassis. For example, the first network port 114 is
configured to be accessible from outside the vehicle 100. Additionally or
alternatively, the first network port 114 may be built into and/or disposed on an
external surface of the chassis 102. For example, an external network cable 116 can
be operably attached to the first network port 114 without having to run the external
network cable 116 inside the vehicle 100. Optionally, the first network port 114 may
include a flap, cover, removable plug insert, and/or the like for preventing an ingress
of foreign contaminants into the first network port 114 when the external network
cable 116 is not operably attached to the first network port 114.
[0021]       The second network bus 106 extends internally within the chassis from the
network circuit 132 to a second network port 118. The second network bus 106 is
operably coupled to the second network port 118. The second network port 118 may
be attached externally to the chassis 102 similar to and/or the same as the first
network 114. It may be noted, that the first network port 114 is positioned at a first
orientation 120 of the vehicle 100, and the second network port 118 is positioned at an
opposing or different, second orientation 122 of the vehicle 100.
[0022]       The first and second orientations 120, 122 may include first and second
different sides of the vehicle 100 (e.g., front end and rear end, left side and right side,
and/or the like). Additionally or alternatively, in embodiments when the vehicle 100
correspond to a rail vehicle, the first and second orientations 120, 122 may include
long hood forward and short hood forward. In another example, in embodiments
                                               5

when the vehicle 100 correspond to a marine vessel, the first and second orientations
120, 122 may include bow and stern.
[0023]       The vehicle 100 includes the network circuit 132. The network circuit 132
may include or represent one or more hardware circuits or circuitry that include, are
connected with, or that both include and are connected with one or more processors,
controllers, or other hardware logic-based devices. The network circuit 132 may be
operably coupled to the first network port 114 by the first network bus 104, and the
second network port 118 by the second network bus 106. In various embodiments,
the network circuit 132 may be configured to pass through network data between the
first network port 114 and the second network port 118. Additionally or alternatively,
the network circuit 132 configured as described herein, may function as a router
transceiver unit as described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,532,850, issued September 10, 2013
and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, for carrying out network
communications over an MU cable bus.
[0024]       Optionally, the first and second network buses 104, 106 may terminate
inside the chassis 102 at a common location, for operable coupling of the buses to the
same network circuit 132. Alternatively, the network buses 104, 106 may terminate
inside the chassis 102 at different locations, for operable coupling to different network
circuits (e.g., the network circuits 132a, 132b, 132c, 132d). Additionally or
alternatively, the network circuit 132 may be connected to only one of the network
ports 114, 118. For example, the vehicle 100 may be a leading vehicle within a
consist that is coupled to one vehicle.
[0025]       Additionally or alternatively, the network circuit 132 may be part of a
control subsystem 130 of the vehicle network system 128. The control subsystem 130
may include or represent one or more hardware circuits or circuitry that include, are
connected with, or that both include and are connected with one or more processors,
controllers, or other hardware logic-based devices. In connection with Figure 1, the
control subsystem 130 includes the network circuit 132d configured for operable
attachment to the first and second network ports 114, 118. It may be noted that the
functions and/or operations performed by the network circuit 132d may be similar to
and/or the same as the network circuit 132. The control subsystem 130 may be
disposed in another vehicle within the vehicle network system 128, a stationary
remote system (e.g., dispatch facility), and/or the like with the network circuit 132d
being configured to be connected to the ports 114, 118 by way of the external network
                                              6

cable 116. The external network cable 116 may include one or more electrical
conductors for communicating network data between the vehicle 100 and the network
circuit 132d. For example, the external network cable 116 may include an Ethernet
bus (e.g., according to the 10BASE-T, 100BASE-T, 1000BASE-T, 10GBASE-T,
and/or the like Ethernet standards) each having eight respective electrical conductors.
Optionally, the network circuit 132d of the control subsystem 130 may be operably
coupled to the external network cable 116 utilizing an internal network bus (e.g.,
similar to and/or the same as the network buses 104, 106 as shown in FIG. 2) and/or a
network port (e.g., similar to and/or the same as the network ports 114, 118).
[0026]      The network circuit 132d is configured, when connected to the first
network port 114 and/or the second network port 118, to determine the first electrical
configuration 124 (shown in Figure 3) and/or the second electrical configuration 126
(shown in Figure 4), respectively of the network buses 104, 106. That is, the network
circuit 132d is configured to sense or detect the electrical configuration of the network
bus 104, 106 to which the network circuit 132d is currently coupled (for data
communications) by way of the first network port 114 and/or the second network port
118. For example, the network circuit 132d may be configured to detect the electrical
configuration of the network bus 104, 106 coupled to the first network port 114 and/or
second network port 118, respectively, as shown in the U.S. Pat. No. 6,175,865,
issued January 16, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Additionally or alternatively, the network circuit 132d may execute an algorithm to
determine the electrical configuration of the network bus 104, 106. For example, the
network circuit 132 may be configured to execute an Auto MDI-X algorithm and/or
be capable of Auto MDI-X. Optionally, the Auto MDI-X algorithm may incorporate
aspects of U.S. Pat. No. 6,175,865. For example, the network circuit 132d may
determine the electrical configuration of the network bus 104, 106 based on detection
and/or status of an RMII register corresponding to performance of the MDI-X in a
crossover or straight-through mode.
[0027]      Additionally or alternatively, the network circuit 132d may include a
dedicated ports corresponding to an orientation of the adjacent vehicle. For example,
the network circuit 132d may include two ports corresponding to the first orientation
120 and the second orientation 122. The network circuit 132d may determine the
electrical configuration of the coupled network bus 104, 106 based on the port the
external network cable 116 is coupled to. Optionally, the network ports 114, 118 may
                                             7

include two ports corresponding to an orientation of the adjacent vehicle. For
example, the network ports 114, 118 may include a port corresponding to the first
orientation 120 of the adjacent vehicle and/or a second port corresponding to the
second orientation 122 of the adjacent vehicle.
[0028]       The control subsystem 130 is configured to determine an orientation of the
vehicle 100 relative to the control subsystem 130 based on the detected or sensed
electrical configuration (e.g., the first electrical configuration 124, the second
electrical configuration 126). For example, the control subsystem 130 determines
whether the vehicle 100 is oriented at the first orientation 120 or the second
orientation 122 relative to the control subsystem 130 (e.g., relative to an adjacent
vehicle in which the control subsystem is disposed) based on the detected or sensed
electrical configuration. That is, since the different electrical configurations (e.g., the
first electrical configuration 124, the second electrical configuration 126) of the two
buses 104, 106 correspond to the different orientations 120, 122 of the vehicle 100,
the control subsystem 130 is able to determine the first orientation 120 or second
orientation 122 based on the sensed or detected electrical configuration.
[0029]       Optionally, the control subsystem 130 may include a vehicle controller
(not shown), which is configured to control the vehicle 100, for example, for
movement along a route. The control subsystem 130 may control the vehicle 100, the
vehicle consist in which the vehicle 100 is a part, and/or an onboard electronic device
of the consist based on the determined relative orientation. For example, if a lead
vehicle is facing with its front end facing the direction of travel, and an adjacent
vehicle is in effect backwards, with its rear end facing the rear end of the lead vehicle,
then the control subsystem 130 may control a device to ensure that the adjacent
vehicle is in effect motoring in reverse, e.g., motoring in the same direction as the lead
vehicle but which is opposite the direction which the front end of the adjacent vehicle
is facing.
[0030]       Additionally or alternatively, in connection with FIG. 2 a plurality of
vehicles (e.g., 100a, 100b, 100c) in a transportation network are configured similarly
to and/or the same as the vehicle 100 shown in FIG. 1.
[0031]       FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of a vehicle network system 134, in
accordance with an embodiment. The system 134 includes a first vehicle 100a, a
second vehicle 100b, and a third vehicle 100c. Optionally, the system 134 may
include two vehicles or more than three vehicles. For example, in a given
                                               8

transportation system, the system could include hundreds or thousands of vehicles.
The vehicles 100a, 100b, 100c include respective externally-accessible first network
buses 104a, 104b, 104c associated with a corresponding first orientation 120 of the
vehicles and respective externally-accessible second network buses 106a, 106b, 106c
associated with a different corresponding second orientation 122 of the vehicles. For
example, the first network buses 104a, 104b, 104c have the first electrical
configuration 124 (Figure 3), and the second network buses 106a, 106b, 106c have the
different, second electrical configuration 126 (Figure 4). It may be noted that
although embodiments are illustrated herein showing the vehicles 100a, 100b, 100c
with two network buses (e.g., the first network buses 104a, 104b, 104c, the second
network buses 106a, 106b, 106c) with different electrical configurations 124, 126
associated with the two different orientations 120, 122 of the vehicles 100a, 100b,
100c, a vehicle in at least one embodiment may include three or more such network
buses respectively associated with three or more different orientations of the vehicle.
[0032]       FIGS. 3-4 are schematic diagrams of the electrical configurations 124-126
of the network buses 104, 106, in accordance with an embodiment. For example, the
electrical configuration 124 shown in FIG. 3 corresponds to a pattern and/or
arrangement of conductor pins with respect to each other of opposing ends of the first
network buses 104a, 104b, 104c and/or at the first network port 114, and the electrical
configuration 126 shown in FIG. 4 correspond to a pattern and/or arrangement of
conductor pins with respect to each other of opposing ends of the second network
buses 106a, 106b, 106c and/or at the second network port 116.
[0033]       The electrical configuration 124 may correspond to an Ethernet straight
through configuration as illustrated in FIG. 3. The Ethernet straight-through
configuration is one in which the pinout corresponding to an arrange of conductor
pins of one end of the bus matches the pinout of the other end of the bus. For
example, the first network buses 104a, 104b, 104c may be Ethernet buses having an
Ethernet connector (e.g., RJ-45, and/or the like) coupled at opposing or terminating
ends of each of the first network bus 104a, 104b, 104c. The first network buses 104a,
104b, 104c, configured as an Ethernet straight-through configuration, may have the
pinouts of each opposing Ethernet connector match. For example, pin 1 of a first
Ethernet connector connected to a first end of the first network bus 104a is coupled
(via a first wire of the cable) to pin 1 of the second Ethernet connector connected to a
second opposing end of the first network bus 104a.
                                               9

[0034]       The electrical configuration 126 may correspond to an Ethernet crossover
configuration as illustrated in FIG. 4. The Ethernet crossover configuration is one in
which the pinout of one end of the bus does not match the pinout of the other end of
the bus. For example, the second network buses 106a, 106b, 106c may be Ethernet
buses having an Ethernet connector (e.g., RJ-45, and/or the like) coupled at opposing
or terminating ends of each of the second network bus 106a, 106b, 106c. The second
network buses 106a, 106b, 106c, configured as an Ethernet crossover configuration,
may have the pinouts corresponding to an arrange of conductor pins of each opposing
Ethernet connector not match. For example, pins 1 and 2 of a first Ethernet
connector connected to a first end of the second network bus 106a is coupled (via a
first wire of the cable) to pins 3 and 6, respectively, of the second Ethernet connector
connected to a second opposing end of the second network bus 106a, and vice versa.
It may be noted further information on Ethernet straight-through and crossover
configurations can be found in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,175,865.
[0035]       In further reference to FIG. 2, the system 134 may further include a
plurality detachable network cables 1 16a, 1 16b operably interconnecting the network
buses (e.g., the first network buses 104a, 104b, 104c, the second network buses 106a,
106b, 106c) of adjacent ones of the vehicles 100a, 100b, 100c. For example the
detachable network cables 11 6a may operably interconnect the network buses of the
first and second vehicles 100a, 100b, and the detachable network cables 1 16b may
operably interconnect the network buses of the second and third vehicles 100b and
100c.
[0036]       The vehicles 100a, 100b, 100c may further comprise respective control
subsystems 130a, 130b, 130c. Each of the control subsystems 130a, 130b, 130c have
respective network circuits 132a, 132b, 132c that are operably coupled to the first
network buses 104a, 104b, 104c and the second network busses 106a, 106b, 106c
internally to the vehicles 100a, 100b, 100c. The network circuits 132a, 132b, 132c
(e.g., similar to and/or the same as the network circuits 132, 132d) are configured to
detect and/or determine the first electrical configuration 124 or the second electrical
configuration 126 of the network buses of adjacent vehicles 100a, 100b, 100c that are
adjacent to the vehicle 100a, 100b, 100c in which the network circuit 132a, 132b,
132c is disposed and connected to by way of the detachable network cables 116a,
116b.
                                              10

[0037]       For example, as shown in FIG. 2, the second vehicle 100b is interposed
between the first vehicle 100a and the third vehicle 100c. The first orientations 122 of
the first vehicle 100a and the third vehicle 100c are facing and/or directed towards the
second vehicle 100b. The network circuit 132b of the second vehicle 100b is
operably connected to the second network bus 106a of the first vehicle 100a by way
of the first network bus 104b of the second vehicle 100b and the first detachable
network cable 116a. Additionally, because the third vehicle 100c is oriented opposite
relative to the first vehicle 100a (in this example), the network circuit 132b is
operably connected to the third vehicle 100c by way of the second network bus 106b
of the second vehicle 100b and the second detachable network cable 116b. The
network circuit 132b is configured to determine the electrical configuration (e.g., the
first configuration 124, the second configuration 126) of the bus (e.g., the second
network bus 106a) of the first vehicle 100a to which the network circuit 132b is
operably coupled. Additionally, the network circuit 132b is configured to determine
the electrical configuration (e.g., the first configuration 124, the second configuration
126) of the bus of the third vehicle 100c to which the network circuit 132b is operably
coupled. In this example, since the network circuit 132b is coupled to the second
network buses 106a, 106c of the first and third vehicles 100a, 100c, and because the
second network buses 106a, 106c of the first and third vehicles 100a, 100c have the
second electrical configuration 126, the network circuit 132b would determine that the
bus (e.g., the second network bus 106a) of the first vehicle 100a to which the network
circuit 132b is operably coupled to has the second configuration 126 and therefore is
the second bus 106a of the first vehicle 100a, and that the bus (e.g., the second
network bus 106c) of the third vehicle 100c to which the network circuit 132b is
coupled has the second configuration 126 and therefore is the second network bus
106c of the third vehicle 100c.
[0038]       Additionally or alternatively, the control subsystems 130a, 130b, 130c are
configured to determine whether the adjacent vehicles 100a, 100b, 100c are oriented
at the first orientation 120 or the second orientation 122, relative to the vehicle 100a,
100b, 100c in which a network circuit 132a, 132b, 132c is disposed, based on the first
electrical configuration 124 or the second electrical configuration 126 that is
determined by the network circuit 132a, 132b, 132c. For example, the control
subsystem 130b of the second vehicle 100b may be configured to determine that the
first vehicle 100a is at the second orientation 122 (relative to the side or end of the
                                               11

second vehicle 100b with which the first network bus 104b of the second vehicle 100b
is associated), based on the second network bus 106a being associated with the second
orientation 122, and that the third vehicle 100c is at the second orientation 122
(relative to the other side or end of the second vehicle 100b with which the second
network bus 106b of the second vehicle 100b is associated), based on the second
network bus 106c also being associated with the second orientation 122.
[0039]       In this manner, when a first vehicle equipped in this fashion is coupled to
an adjacent, similarly-equipped vehicle at an unknown orientation (for example, the
adjacent vehicle is attached to the rear end of the first vehicle, but it is unknown if the
adjacent vehicle is oriented with its front end towards the first vehicle or its rear end
towards the first vehicle), the control subsystem of the first vehicle can detect the
electrical configuration of the network bus 104 or 106 of the adjacent vehicle to which
the first vehicle is coupled, and with the electrical configuration being associated with
a particular orientation of the adjacent vehicle, how the adjacent vehicle is oriented
relative to the first vehicle.
[0040]       FIGS. 5-7 show embodiments of a vehicle network system 500 where the
network buses are implemented as Ethernet buses having straight-through
configurations 524 (e.g., the electrical configuration 124) and crossover
configurations 526 (e.g., the electrical configuration 126). Specifically, for a plurality
of vehicles 502a, 502b in a transportation network, the first network bus 104 of each
vehicle 502a, 502b, associated with a first orientation (e.g., side, end, or long hood or
short hood forward) 120 of the vehicles 502a, 502b, is an Ethernet bus configured as a
crossover configuration 526, and the second network bus 106 of each vehicle 502a,
502b, associated with a second orientation (e.g., other side, other end, or other of the
long hood or short hood forward) 122 of the vehicles 502a, 502b, is an Ethernet bus
configured as a straight-through configuration 524. The vehicles 502a, 502b may be
similar to and/or the same as the vehicle 100 shown in Figure 1. In each vehicle 502a,
502b, the first and second network buses 104, 106 of the vehicle 502a, 502b are
operably coupled to a respective network circuit 132e, 132f. Adjacent vehicles 502a,
502b are detachably coupled for data communications by a detachable Ethernet cable
516. Optionally, the detachable Ethernet cable 516 may be similar to and/or the same
as the external network cable 116. The network circuits 132e, 132f may be similar to
and/or the same as the network circuit 132 shown in FIG. 1.
                                             12

[0041]       In connection with FIG. 5, the first vehicle 502a and the second vehicle
502b are positioned having the same orientation. For example, the second vehicle
502b is positioned such that the first orientation 120 of the vehicle 502b is facing the
second orientation 122 of the first vehicle 502a. The second network bus 106 of the
first vehicle 502a is coupled to the first network bus 104 of the second vehicle 502b
via the detachable Ethernet cable 516. The network circuit 132e of the first vehicle
502a can determine that it is coupled to the first network bus 104 of the second
vehicle 502b by detecting that the first network bus 104 has the crossover
configuration 526. For example, knowing that the connection is through the second
network bus 106 of the first vehicle 502a, the network circuit 132e will detect the
network circuit 132e is connected to the first network bus 104 of the second vehicle
502b having the crossover configuration 526 by determining that pin 1 of the second
network bus 106 connected to the network circuit 132e is coupled to pin 3 of the
network circuit 132f on the second vehicle 502b, and/or that pin 2 of the second
network bus 106 is connected to pin 6 of the network circuit 132f on the second
vehicle 502b, and/or the like.
[0042]       In connection with FIG. 6, the first vehicle 502a and the second vehicle
502b are positioned having opposing orientations. For example, the second vehicle
502b is positioned such that the second orientation 122 of the second vehicle 502b is
facing the second orientation 122 of the first vehicle 502a. The second network bus
106 of the first vehicle 502a is coupled to the second network bus 106 of the second
vehicle 502b via the detachable Ethernet cable 516. The network circuit 132e of the
first vehicle 502a can determine that it is coupled to the second network bus 106 of
the second vehicle 502b by detecting that the second network bus 106 has the straight
through configuration 524. For example, knowing that the connection is through the
second network bus 106 of the first vehicle 502a, the network circuit 132e will detect
the network circuit 132e is connected to the second network bus 106 of the second
vehicle 502b having the straight through configuration 524 by determining that the
pins of at each of the network circuit 132e, 132f match.
[0043]       In connection with FIG. 7, the orientation of the first vehicle 502a is
flipped, with respect to FIGS. 5-6, such that the first vehicle 502a and the second
vehicle 502b are positioned having opposing orientations. For example, the second
vehicle 502b is positioned such that the first orientation 120 of the second vehicle
502b is facing the first orientation 120 of the first vehicle 502a. The first network bus
                                             13

104 of the first vehicle 502a is coupled to the first network bus 104 of the second
vehicle 502b via the detachable Ethernet cable 516. The network circuit 132e of the
first vehicle 502a can determine that it is coupled to the first network bus 104 of the
second vehicle 502b by detecting that the first network bus 104 of the second vehicle
502b if the pins as seen at each network circuit 132e, 132f of the two vehicles 502a,
502b match.
[0044]       Additionally or alternatively, the first vehicle 502a and the second vehicle
502b are positioned having the same orientation. For example, the second vehicle
502b is positioned such that the second orientation 122 of the vehicle 502b is facing
the first orientation 120 of the first vehicle 502a. The first network bus 104 of the
first vehicle 502a is coupled to the second network bus 106 of the second vehicle
502b via the detachable Ethernet cable 516. The network circuit 132e of the first
vehicle 502a can determine that it is coupled to the second network bus 106 of the
second vehicle 502b having the straight-through configuration 526 if the pins as seen
at each network circuit 132e, 132f of the two vehicles 502a, 502b do not match (e.g.,
similar to as explained in regards to FIG. 5).
[0045]       Additionally or alternatively, the external network cable 116 and/or the
detachable Ethernet cable 516 that interconnect adjacent vehicles (e.g., 502a and
502b, 100a and 100b, 100b and 100c) all the same and/or have a designated
configuration (e.g., straight through, cross over).
[0046]       It may be noted that although embodiments are described herein wherein
the electrical configuration (e.g., the electrical configuration 524, 526) of the network
buses 104, 106 include Ethernet straight-through and crossover, in other embodiments
the electrical configurations could include different impedances (e.g., impedances that
are different by more than a threshold, to avoid variances in impedance
measurement), different configurations of crossover, and/or the like.
[0047]       Another embodiment relates to a method (e.g., a method of vehicle
control). The method includes, with a network circuit of a control subsystem of a first
vehicle, determining an electrical configuration of a network bus of a second vehicle.
The method further includes, with the control subsystem, determining an orientation
of the second vehicle relative to the first vehicle based at least in part on the electrical
configuration that is determined. The method may further include the control
subsystem controlling a vehicle consist that includes the first vehicle and the second
vehicle based at least in part on the orientation that is determined.
                                              14

[0048]       In another embodiment, a method includes, with a network circuit of a
control subsystem of a first vehicle, determining whether an Ethernet bus of a second
vehicle is configured in an Ethernet crossover configuration or in an Ethernet straight
through configuration. The method further includes, with the control subsystem,
determining an orientation of the second vehicle relative to the first vehicle based at
least in part on the Ethernet crossover configuration or the Ethernet straight-through
configuration that is determined. The method may further include the control
subsystem controlling a vehicle consist that includes the first vehicle and the second
vehicle based at least in part on the orientation that is determined.
[0049]       With Base-T Ethernet, there are two basic cabling types. The first is a
straight-through cable, which was originally used to have 10BaseT devices connect to
hubs, where devices already swapped its positive and minus signals in order to
communicate. The second is a straight-through cable, which was used when a hub or
router needed to communicate with another hub or router, again swapping plus and
minus signals in the cable.
[0050]       With the industry moving towards removing MU cables, one of the issues
that is solved to determine if trailing units are long-hood or short-hood forward is by
swapping the forward/reverse trainlines in one of the directions. This makes it so the
unit just follows the trainline as opposed to locomotive personnel going to each
locomotive and setting the direction to correspond with "forward" and "reverse." The
current plan to replace MU is to use Ethernet. One method to handle this would be to
use a straight-through cable going to one particular end of the locomotive (such as
short) or other vehicle and a crossover cable going to one particular end of the
locomotive (such as long) or other vehicle. As long as every locomotive ships with
whichever method, then the direction can always be known by each trail,
corresponding to the lead. This may be done by reading the status over RMII of
whether or not MDI-X is performing in a crossover or straight-through fashion.
Another method would be to dedicate (and never swap) a particular port on a switch
that goes to that particular direction (short or long hood). Then by port there is an
understanding of where the traffic is coming from - but if they are swapped then
locomotives could pull in the wrong direction - whereas by using the cable method
then the only issue that could come up is when the cable itself is replaced (and tested).
[0051]       In an embodiment, a vehicle includes a chassis, a first network bus, and a
second network bus. The first network bus extends from internally in the chassis
                                              15

(e.g., at a location where a network circuit may be connected to the bus) to a first
network port attached externally to the chassis. The first network port is positioned in
association with a first orientation of the vehicle, e.g., the front end of the vehicle.
The second network bus extends from internally in the chassis to a second network
port attached externally to the chassis. The second network port is positioned in
association with a different, second orientation of the vehicle, e.g., the rear end of the
vehicle. The first network bus has a first electrical configuration and the second
network bus has a second electrical configuration that is different than the first
electrical configuration.
[0052]       According to an aspect, having different electrical configurations in
association with the different orientations allows a control subsystem of an adjacent
vehicle, when coupled to the first network bus or the second network bus (e.g., by
way of a detachable network cable that extends between the vehicles), to determine
how the vehicles are oriented relative to one another. For example, the control
subsystem may include a network circuit that is configured to determine the electrical
configurations of network buses attached to it. Based on the determined electrical
configuration in a given instance, the control subsystem can determine the vehicle
orientation.
[0053]       As one example, the network buses may be Ethernet cables or other
Ethernet buses, and the networks ports may be Ethernet ports. (The buses are used, in
conjunction with routers, hubs, switches, or other network circuits, to communicate
data, e.g., for vehicle control purposes.) One of the Ethernet buses is configured in an
Ethernet crossover configuration, and the other is configured in an Ethernet straight
through configuration. Plural vehicles in a transportation system may be similarly
configured, for example, in each vehicle an Ethernet crossover bus extends to an
Ethernet port at the front or rear of the vehicle, and an Ethernet straight-through bus
extends to an Ethernet port at the other of the front or rear of the vehicle. Whenever
one vehicle is coupled to an adjacent vehicle for network data communications, the
one vehicle can determine which end of the adjacent vehicle is attached to it by
determining the presence of the Ethernet crossover bus or the Ethernet straight
through bus.
