branch conduit connected to said tapping tee and said one of said at least two conduits.
[027]             The base can include apertures or formations which allow said base to be
secured to a ground location.

                                                    3
 [028]          The base can receive a stake through it to secure said base to a ground location.
 [029]          There can be a lateral pin to secure a stake to the base.
 [030]          The base can include one of the following: channels or concave formations to
 receive each of said two or more conduits; channels or concave formations to receive each of
said two or more conduits where each adjacent channel or concave formation is at a different

 Detailed description of the embodiment or embodiments
 [056]            Illustrated in Figures 1 to 8 is a first conduit joining system 10, and in Figures 9 to
 16 which illustrate a second conduit joining system, each having a base 14 for receiving two
 main conduits 20 and 22. The base 14 can include additional channels like channels 14.1 and
 14.2 so that additional main conduits can be received by the base, and held in spaced apart
 relationship, in the same manner as conduits 20 and 22. The base 14 includes a clamp
 receiving means 14.3, in this case grooves 14.8 with upper inclined faces 14.81, as will be
discussed in more detail later, for receiving at least one clamping means 16.1 on the respective
tapping tees 16 for each conduit 20 and 22.
 [057]           The first and second conduit joining system systems 10 and 110 of later
description are generally directed to a system whereby two main conduits will be clamped to the
 base 14 which will be tapped into and branch conduits 24 and 26 taken off, whereby the main
conduits 20 and 22 are large in diameter than the respective branch conduits 24 and 26.
 [058]           While separate tapping tees 16, and thus clamping means 16.1 are provided in
 Figure 1 for the two conduits 20 and 22, it will be understood that if desired a single piece clamp
 having two tapping tees thereon can be provided (or a respective tapping tee for each main
conduit present if more than two), whereby a single clamping means can clamp multiple main
conduits to the base 14.
 [059]           The base 14 has a generally rectangular shape in plan view with bulbous or
curved central portions 14.6 on the rights and left sides which from the ends of a central support
formation     14.7. This shape or footprint of the base                14 allows a cover 12, having
complementarily shaped sides, to be used with the base 14 and assembled thereto, thereby to
 protect the components of the joining system and allow an access cover for inspection and a
 location for a meter 16.92 and its reading, and mains control valve handle 16.91, both of which
are illustrated in Figures 17 to 19.
 [060]           The tapping tee 16 can include control valve functionality, as is known in the art
or if desired, in addition to the tapping tee 16 a separate control valve can be provided on the
joining system 10 or in association with it.
 [061]           The base 14 is preferably constructed and shaped to provide sufficient strength
so as to allow the clamping portion 16.1 of tapping tee 16 to clamp the pipes 20 and 22 with a
 predetermined clamping force so as to provide some additional mechanical strength to an
electrofusion join that the tapping tee 16 can provide.
 [062]           As best illustrated in Figures 6 and 7, the base 14 of Figure 6 receives a
 respective tapping tee 16 of Figure 7, by the tee 16 first being rotated through 180 degrees and
then by the under surface of the inclined side rails 16.2 of tee 16 being positioned on the

                                                    6
 upwardly facing surfaces 14.5 of the base 14, and slid in the direction of arrow 14.4 so that the
 upper inclined face 16.3 wedges into place in the grooves 14.8 which have an inclined upper
surface14.81, which declines in the direction of arrow 14.4, so that an appropriate clamping
force is applied to the outer surfaces of the conduit 20 or 22 to which it is applied, when the front
edges 16.4 of the tee 16 abut the ends 14.82 of the groves 14.8. Once in the desired location,
a self-tapping screw can be driven into the surfaced 14.5 adjacent the rear end 16.5 of the rails
 16.2 thereby preventing the urging or separation of the tee 16 and the base 14 in a direction
opposite to arrow 14.4.
 [063]            Located at the opposed ends of the central formation 14.7, near to the curved
 portions 14.6 are two securing apertures 14.9. The apertures 14.9 open through the under
surface of the base 14, as best seen in underneath view of Figure 4, so as to allow the base 14
to be staked to a ground or other location by means of star shaped stakes 28. The cross section
of the apertures 14.9 and the stakes 28 can be any appropriate shape to achieve the staking or
ground or location securing functionality. While the stakes 28 and apertures 14.9 prevent
 movement in a lateral direction relative to the direction of extension of the stakes 28 during
assembly, if preventing movement along the stakes is required, then a pin or self-tapping screw
can be used to also secure the base 14 to the stakes 28. This can be advantageous if the
joining system were required to be used via a side wall of a trench, rather than in the base of a
trench as will be most common.
 [064]    The channels or concave formations 14.1 and 14.2, as best seen in Figure 8 are sized
and shaped so as to provide support for the bases of the conduit 20 and 22, when they are
 received in the channels or concave formations 14.1, 14.2, and to provide that support for up to
almost the whole of the lower circumference, or lower half of the conduits 20 and 22. While only
two such channels or concave formations 14.1 and 14.2 are illustrated in respect of Figures 1 to
8, it will be readily understood that the base 14 can be formed with as many channels or
concave formations as main pipes to be secured to the base 14. The embodiments are
 illustrated with only 2 main conduits 20 and 22, as the present invention and embodiments are
 particularly advantageous to be used with a system where pipes are deployed or installed in
 pairs, such as when two pipes of the same diameter are extruded and coiled together, and a de
coil system is provided as a means to deploy the two pipes from their coiling gear, such as
described in the applicant's co-pending applications AU<removed-apn> and AU <removed-apn>.
 [065]            The tapping tees 16, as best illustrated in Figure 7 each have an upper cylindrical
section 16.6, which houses a tap or a tap and valve, which in turn has a hex drive socket 16.9 to
so as to tap into the main conduits 20 and 22. The tees 16 also have a cylindrical branch outlet
 16.7 to allow a branch conduit 24 or 26 to be connected to the tee 16, by means of a
compression fitting 16.8 so as to receive a flowing substance from the main conduits 20 and 22.

                                                    7
While a compression fitting 16.8 is illustrated, it will be understood that an electrofusion union
fitting could be used to join the branch outlets 16.7 to a respective branch conduit 24 or 26. It
will be noted that in the figures 1 to 8, the branch conduits 24 and 26 and the branch outlets
16.7 are arranged so as to extend at 90 degrees to the direction of extension of the conduits 20
and 22. However, it will be readily understood that the branch conduits can extend from the tees
in any desired direction, or in any direction which has a component lateral to the direction of
extension of the two main conduits 20 and 22, depending upon the needs at the site. This can
be done by providing tees 16 which have different angular arrangements of the cylindrical
branch outlet 16.7 relative to the direction of extension of the rails 16.2
[066]           As illustrated in Figure 1, there are two main conduits 20 and 22 and for each of
these which are received by the base 14, there is a respective clamp or clamping means in the
form of clamping portion16.1 and clamping rails16.2. It will be noted in respect of the base 14,
that the grooves 14.8 with upper inclined faces 14.81 for channel 14.1 are located at one end of
the base 14, while for the other channel 14.2 the grooves 14.8 with upper inclined faces 14.81
are located at the opposite end of the base 14. This provides a respective clamping location for
the adjacent main conduits 20, 22, which is staggered and or spaced from an adjacent clamping
location, in the direction of extension of the two or more conduits. This assists to ensure that the
tapping tees 16, and their respective branch conduits 24 and 26 do not interfere with each other
during assembly, or later.
[067]           While the joining system 10 has provision for two main conduits, it will be
understood that the two conduits can respectively carry one of the following: gas, water, potable
water, pumped sewage, recycled water, pumped waste, communication cable, power cable, oil,
fuel. In the case of deployment of two pipe systems, these will generally be paired in industry
required pairings, such as: gas and water for use in mining operations for coal seam gas; gas
and water for residential use; pumped waste and or sewage and recycled water as in the case
of recycling plants and installations for residential and or commercial use; or communications
and power in the case of commercial and residential use; or oil and fuel, as examples of just a
few.
[068]            It will be noted from Figure 8 that the base 14 has the base of its channels or
concave formation 14.1 and 14.2 located at approximately the same distance from the under
surface or lower edge 14.33 of the base 14. If desired, as will be discussed below with respect
to the second joining system 110, the base 14 can be made so that the distance is different
whereby one main conduit 20 or 22 will have its upper and lowers surfaces (and thus tapping
tees 16) at a different level to that of the other conduit 22 or 20. It will also be noted from Figure
8 that the grooves 14.8 associated with the outboard sides of the conduits 20 and 22 or channel

                                                    8
14.1 and 14.2, have a tapered lead-in face14.83, which assists with the alignment of the tapping
tee 16 as it is engaging the grooves 14.8.
[069]            As is best illustrated in Figures 1 to 5, the housing or cover 12 includes two open
cylindrical formations 12.1, which will be located over the upper cylindrical section 16.6 of the
tapping tees 16 to allow a service person to make the tap and or open the valve and or close
the valve, once the system 10 has been assembled, by allowing access to the hex drive socket
16.9. The formation 12.1 which pass through the upper surface of the housing 12 also enable
the upper ends of the cylindrical sections 16.6 to protrude into the formations 12.1. The upper
rims of the formations 12.1 can also receive a closure cap (not illustrated) so as to prevent
ingress via formation 12.1 and into the housing 12, once the joining system 10 has been buried
in a trench.
[070]            The housing 12 will enclose the points of connection of the branch pipes 24 and
26 to their respective tapping tees 16 which tap into the conduits 20 and 22.
[071]            It will be seen from Figures 1 to 4, that the housing 12 has left and right main
conduit cut-outs 12.2 and on one side of the housing 12 between these two branch conduit cut
outs 12.3. The fourth side 12.4 of the housing 12, as seen in Figure 4, has no cut-outs or
openings in it. These cut-outs 12.2 and 12.3 can sized and or shaped so as to engage the
outer surfaces of the respective main and branch conduits to thereby provide further mechanical
assistance to the electrofusion joints, and the clamping provided by the clamping portions of the
tees 16. Additionally these cut-outs 12.2 and 12.3 can be sized and shaped, or may receive
grommet or gasket like components (not illustrated) to assist in preventing ingress of foreign
material when the system 10 is buried. Alternatively the cut-outs 12.2 and 12.3 may be sized
and shape so as to provide sufficient clearance to with respect to the main and branch conduits.
[072]            It will be seen from Figures 3 and 5 that one of the right hand side compression
fittings 16.8 is not visible from the plan view of Figure 5, as it is located within the housing 12,
whereas the left hand side compression fitting is located well outside the periphery of the
housing 12. If desired, as discussed below with respect to the second system 110, the size and
shape of the base 14 and the housing 12 can be chosen so that the tees 16, outlets 16.7 and
compression fittings 16.8 are positioned wholly within the periphery of the housing 12.
[073]            The housing or cover 12 of Figures 1 to 5 can be provided with a inwardly
projecting lip along its inboard lower most edges, which can be used to snap onto the outboard
lower periphery of the base 14, to lock the two together, or alternatively, if no locking or
interlocking formations are provided, a service person can simply secure the base and housing
by one or more appropriately sized screws.

[074]            To provide the required strength and functional capacity need in the base 14 of
conduit joining system 10, the base 14 is preferably injection moulded in a single piece.
[075]            Illustrated in Figures 9 to 15 is a conduit joining system 110, which as previously
described is similar to that of conduit joining system 10, with like parts being like numbered. The
system 110 is similar to that of system 10 in that it is specifically adapted for two main conduits
20 and 22 and respectively joining to them the branch conduits 24 and 26.
[076]            There are several differences between the system 110 by comparison to that of
system 10, and these will now be described.
[077]            The base 14 of system 110 is more elongated in the direction at 90 degrees to
the direction of extension of the main conduits 20 and 22 or channels 14.1 and 14.2. This
ensures that the compression fittings 16.8 remain within the confines of the housing or cover 12,
and that only the branch conduits 24 and 26 pass under the periphery of the housing 12. In this
way all of the tees 16 and the compression fittings 16.8 are protected by the housing 12.
[078]            Another difference between the base 14 of system 110 and system 10, is that the
base 14 does not include any grooves 14.8 and does not rely on interacting inclined planes to
achieve its clamping forces. Instead, the base 14 of system 110 achieves its clamping forces by
two sets of four captured nuts 14.14, which are located in the underside of the base and visible
in Figures 10, 12 and 13, and are accessed through apertures 14.141 in the base (see Figure
14). The nuts 14.14 provide a respective metal thread to receive a respective bolt (not
illustrated), which are used to secure the clamping portion 16.1 of the tees 16, to the base 14,
via apertures 16.12 thereby clamping the conduits 20 and 22 in a spaced apart relationship,
against the base 14.
[079]            The base 14 of Figures 9 to 16 also differs from that of system 10, in that the
channels or concave formation 14.1 and 14.2, which receive the main conduits 20 and 22, are
located at different datum or heights with respect to each other, as is best seen from Figures 10
and 12. As this base 14 also seeks to minimise the spacing between the cut-outs 12.21, 12.22
and 12.31 and 12.32 in the housing and the respective conduit, it makes contact at these
peripheries with the conduits 20, 22 and branch conduits 24 and 26. The branch conduits 24
and 26 are supported at different heights by means of integrally moulded supports 14.24 and
14.26 for conduits 24 and 26 respectively. The support 14.24 is located at a higher datum or
location than that of support 14.26, which will be at approximately the same height as the
branch outlets 16.7 on respective conduits 20 and 22, due to the different heights of the
channels 14.1 and 14.2.
[080]            As the branch conduit 26 sits lower with respect to the base 14, a recessed
portion 14.217 is formed between the channel 14.1 and the support 14.26, so that the

                                                  10
compression fitting 16.8 on this branch conduit 26 will sit therein and not be adversely interfered
or oriented when the assembly is made. Additionally it will be noted that the tapping tee 16 of
the system 110 has a square shaft drive spindle 16.9, whereas the drive 16.9 of the system 10
has a hex drive socket.
[081]            The base 14 has diverging formations 14.241 and 14.261 which extend away
from the respective supports 14.24 and 14.26. These interact with respective cut-outs 12.31
and12.32 on the housing 12 to substantially occlude any spaces which may otherwise be
present as the branch conduits 24 and 26 pass under the periphery of the respective cut-outs
12.31 and 12.32.
[082]            The housing 12 differs in that between cut-outs 12.31 and 12.32 the lower rim
12.5 includes an inwardly projecting rim or formation which allows the rim 12.5 to be captured
under the lower edge of the base 14, between the formations 14.241 and 14.261 as is best
illustrated in Figure 13. The opposite side of housing 12 also includes a downwardly extending
tongue 12.6 which also terminates in an inwardly projecting rim or formation 12.51 which will
engage the lower edge of the base 14 in a purposely located cut-out 14.13 located midway
along the side of the base 14 which is closest to the channel 14.2.
[083]            As best illustrated in Figures 15 and 16, the housing 12 has a generally planar
upper surface while on its under surface as illustrated in Figure 16 has reinforcing ribs 12.7,
which criss-cross the under surface to provide additional strength to resist the forces and weight
of material under which it will be buried.
[084]            Another difference between the base 14 of system 110 to that of system 10, is
that system 10 provides the clamping countering forces by means of the base being a relatively
solid construction. Whereas the base 14 of the system110 achieves the required strength by
means of circumferential strengthening ribs 14.45 as best seen in Figures 12 and 13. The
periphery of the base 14 of system 110 also includes circumferential ribs 14.27, and another
internal rib 14.29 to assist with extra mechanical strength and rigidity in the base 14. The base
14 also includes holes or apertures 14.40 which can be used to secure the base 14 to a
concrete foundation or base in a trench or on a surface, or can be used to insert stakes to
perform such a functions.
[085]            While the above describes respective clamping portions           16.1  used with
respective conduits 20 and 22, where each clamping portion carries its own tapping tee 16 and
or associated valve, it will be readily understood that a single clamping portion which bridges all
and clamps all conduits to be secured can be utilised, such a single clamping portion will
include a respective number of tapping tees 16 and or tees with associated valves. In such a
case, where the clamping means 16.1 extends over two or more conduits, it will do so at an

                                                 11
angle to the direction of extension of the two or more conduits, so that the branch outlets 16.7
will be in a staggered arrangement on the base, so that they do not interfere with each other.
[086]            In a typical system, the two main supply pipes or conduits 20, 22, for example
would be DN63-125mm where one with blue stripe for potable water and one with yellow stripe
for gas would be provided in a supply trench in a street and there will be smaller branch pipes or
conduits 24 and 26 tapping off the main pipes or conduits 20 and 22 to supply each house in a
street. The smaller pipes or branch conduits 24 and 26 would be typically DN25-32mm.
[087]           The tapping tee 16 is a live tapping tee, which typically allows joining of the
branch pipe or conduit 24 or 26 onto the larger pipe or conduit 20 or 22, often without having to
turn off the pressure from the main conduit 20 or 22.
[088]           The tapping tee 16 can be an already existing independent unit that is fixed to
the pipe with mechanical clamping forces as well as an electrofusion join to weld and form a
pressure seal between the tapping tee 16 and the main pipe or conduit 20, 22- as described in
various prior art patents such as GB2199271 or GB2426306. Tapping tee designs typically have
an under clamp component that serves as a compression device to aid the electrofusion
process as well as mechanical reinforcement after the weld is complete. They can also be a
purely bolted saddle type arrangement.
[089]           Generally, depending upon the use to which the invention described above is
applied, the housing 12 can be modified so as to incorporate a meter such as the meters 16.92
in Figures 17 to 19, and or a mains control valve handle 16.91 and be a relatively quick and
uncomplicated system for providing metered water and or gas service connections to a house
on a street, but as also discussed above, it can have wider applications than only residential or
only water and gas.
[090]            Illustrated in Figures 17 to 19 is an embodiment of a conduit joining system,
which utilises a base 14 similar to that described above with respect to Figures 1 to 8, however
a cover is provided which enables the system to include two meters, 16.92, one for say gas
metering and one for water metering, if gas and water mains are the main conduits 20 and 22.
Additionally the embodiment of Figures 17 to 19 illustrate how a mains control valve handle
16.91 can be positioned on the drive 16.9 of the tapping tee/valve, to act as a mains control
valve, one for water and one for gas in this example.
[091]           While the above describes the tapping tee 16 having its clamping portion
remaining in place, it technically only needs to do so while an electrofusion joint is made. Thus
the branching can be effected by means of a temporary clamp if desired.
[092]           The base 14 as described above forms the bottom half of the clamping system,
while the cover 12 provides some protection and a cavity around the tapping tees 16 and also

                                                 12
allows the possibility to provide permanent access from ground level without digging, by say
enveloping the systems 10 or 110 within a cylinder (not illustrated) which extends up to ground
level, which has a replaceable cover to prevent misadventure or accidentally falling into the hole
provided by the cylinder. If valve handles 16.91 are provided on the housing 12 then an
extension can be used by an operator to turn or operate the valve handle 16.91, and such an
extension may be used to drop a meter reader into the cylinder to read any meter 16.92 located
at a lower location. Alternatively the meters 16.92 and or main valves could be piped up to a
location nearer the surface, depending upon the depth of burying of the joining system 10 or
110, so that a simple cover can be provided. Another alternative can be that at the region where
a joining system 10 or 110 is to be positioned, the main conduits 20 and 22 can be brought to a
closer surface level, allowing the joining system 10 or 110 to be readily accessed from a surface
location.
[093]            Additionally, while the above describes situations where there is more than one
main conduit 20 or 22, there is an indication that both tapping tees may be put in at the one
time. However, it may be required to install only one tapping tee 16, leaving the other
untouched. In which case a blanking cover or saddle can be installed in place of the tapping tee
16 to protect the main pipe for future installation of a tapping tee. Such blanking cover would
have the same tapered side rails as in system 10, or aperture rails in the case of system 110, in
order to hold the untapped pipe in place and protect it from damage until future use.
Alternatively, a second tee or blanking cover is not be provided, and reliance will be had on the
housing 12 interacting with the base 14 to thereby keep the second main conduit relatively
clean and free of any ingress by earth or dirt, to allow access later for proper connection to be
made to the second main conduit by a branch conduit.
[094]            The clamping arrangement of system 10 also has the advantage that it has a firm
end stop in order to position the tapping tee 16 correctly such that the branch outlet 16.7 is in
correct alignment with the housing or cover 12. As existing systems suffer from possible
contamination issues, for example grit or rocks being included between the clamping surfaces,
a relief formation can be provided on the under-side of the clamping portion 16, which will act as
a non-clamping surface, allowing any contamination present to be ejected into such a relief
formation.
[095]            While the above is directed to conduits that will mainly carry flowable substances
as described above, the system would use different cutting and tapping systems in the case of
power or communications signals being carried by the main conduits.
[096]            The above embodiments, in particular the bases 14 and cover 12 are preferably
manufactured from polyethylene, but can be made of any appropriate polyolefin, or any
appropriate material, subject to and depending upon the contents of the main and or branch

                                                   13
conduits or the material from which they are manufactured. The stakes 28 can also be
manufactured of any appropriate material such as polyethylene.
[097]            Where ever it is used, the word "comprising" is to be understood in its "open"
sense, that is, in the sense of "including", and thus not limited to its "closed" sense, that is the
sense of "consisting only of". A corresponding meaning is to be attributed to the corresponding
words "comprise", "comprised" and "comprises" where they appear.
[098]            It will be understood that the invention disclosed and defined herein extends to all
alternative combinations of two or more of the individual features mentioned or evident from the
text. All of these different combinations constitute various alternative aspects of the invention.
[099]            While particular embodiments of this invention have been described, it will be
evident to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be embodied in other specific
forms without departing from the essential characteristics thereof. The present embodiments
and examples are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive,
and all modifications which would be obvious to those skilled in the art are therefore intended to
be embraced therein.
