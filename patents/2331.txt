BACKGROUND OF      THE   INVENTION
[0002]     The    present       invention           relates       to     transdermal           drug
delivery systems.
[0003]    The    delivery      of    drugs      through      the     skin       provides      many
advantages. Primarily, it is a comfortable, convenient                                and non
invasive    way of    administering            drugs.    Moreover,          such a    means        of
delivery provides for uninterrupted therapy and a higher degree
of control over drug concentrations in the blood.
[0004]       U.S.       patent           5,164,190          discloses              transdermal
administration       of   hydrophobic          drugs     via     a  diffusion        mechanism
in  which    the   drug   is    dissolved         in   a carrier        at     concentrations
between    20% and     80% of       saturation         concentration.            This   patent,
however,      fails     to     suggest         an     amorphous         transdermal            drug
delivery system in which the drug is supersaturated and in
                                             - 1 -

which  the  supersaturated   portion      of   the   drug  is present     in  an
amorphous drug-in-adhesive matrix.
[0005]   United    States    Patent       No.     4,409,206     discloses       a
preparation    in  the   form   of     a    polyacrylate      film  with      an
amorphous active pharmaceutical ingredient embedded therein.
This  patent  does  not,  however,    disclose      a  transdermal   delivery
device or a system containing a supersaturated concentration of
an amorphous drug within an adhesive matrix.

the publication discloses a transdermal therapeutic system for
the     administration            of    amorphous         terazosin        to   the      skin
comprising        a    backing       layer,     a    pressure-sensitive            adhesive
reservoir        layer     and/or       a   matrix       layer,     and     optionally       a
removable protective layer.
 [0007]        United      States       Publication        No.    2005/0175678        Al   is
directed       to   a   polymer       matrix      suitable       for    the   transdermal
administration          of   rotigotine        and    a   method     of    preparing      the
same.      The polymer matrix contains                 a   supersaturated        amount    of
a rotigotine base such that the part of the rotigotine that is
not dissolved in the matrix polymer is dispersed in the matrix
as   amorphous        particles.          The    publication         further     discloses
that the matrix may be a component of a system for transdermal
administration          of    rotigotine,        wherein       the    system     can     have
components        such     as     a   protective        layer,      a    backing     layer,
further      polymer       layers,       and/or      a    membrane       which     controls
release of the rotigotine.
 [0008]        United States          Patent    No.    6,902,741      is   directed to       a
transdermal        system       which     includes       a   sex    hormone-containing
adhesive      matrix,      containing         inclusions       of   sex     hormone    in    a
hydrophilic        non-crosslinked           polymer.          The    active     substance
contained       in    the   inclusions         is    preferably       amorphous       to   an
extent     of   more     than     50% by     weight      of   the    active    substance.
The   active      substance-containing             laminate      is   characterized        in
that    the     active     substance        inclusions        are    contained      in    the
adhesive matrix in dissolved or dispersed form.
 [0009]        Various methods of manufacturing transdermal systems
in   which     the   drug     is    supersaturated         are   known.       U.S.   Patent

transdermal system comprising heating a mixture of undissolved
drug        and       reservoir        matrix        material        to      a    predetermined
temperature,            followed      by cooling.             These references,           however,
fail       to    disclose        a   method       of    making      a   stable        transdermal
device containing an active agent in amorphous form.
[0010]            Finally,       one problem          encountered       with     drug delivery
devices         comprising         supersaturated             solutions       is    insufficient
storage         stability        due    to     crystallization            processes.            Such
crystallization              processes     result in           a reduction       in    the  amount
of     dissolved          drug,    and    an     increase        in   the      amount     of    drug
present        in     the    crystalline       state,        thus   reducing        the   efficacy
of    such a supersaturated               device.             To prevent crystallization
processes          in    transdermal       delivery          devices    and     to be      able   to
administer             the    therapeutically             desired      dose       continuously,
crystallization              inhibitors      are       usually     added      to   any    delivery
device.          U.S. Patent Nos. 6,465,005, 5,676,968, 6,440,454, and
6,537,576           describe        methods        utilizing         such      crystallization
inhibitors.                   However,         the         addition        of       non-adhesive
crystallization              inhibitors       alters        the   adhesion       properties       of
the      adhesive         by  reducing      its       adhesiveness        or    by    making     the
system        softer.         As   such,     the      prior      art   fails      to    suggest     a
method        of     stabilizing        an    amorphous          drug-in-adhesive           matrix
delivery device.                Moreover,       the prior         art   fails      to   suggest     a
method          of       reestablishing           an       amorphous          drug-in-adhesive
delivery device.

wherein       the       method         comprises          packaging          the     transdermal
delivery device in a pouch.                      The pouch may be the same size or

 [0047]        The      stability         of    the    amorphous          form    of    an   active
agent     at    a    storage        temperature          is     dependent        on   the    active
agent's      glass      transition          temperature           (Tg)    and   the    difference
between      the       glass       transition          temperature          and     the     storage
temperature.           Applicants          have     found that an amorphous                 form of
an   active      agent       having       a   higher       Tg    is    more    stable      than    an
amorphous form of an active agent having a lower Tg.
 [0048]        Specifically, Applicants have found that                                 the    Tg  of
the   amorphous         forms       of  oxybutynin,           fentanyl,        and   scopolamine
are   very     low      (lower       than     the     normal        storage     temperature        of
20*C   to 250C).             For     example,       Applicants          have    found     that    the
glass      transition            temperature           of      the      amorphous         form     of
oxybutynin        is    about      -20*C,      which     is    about      400C to     about     450C
lower    than      room      temperature.             On    the      other    hand,     the    glass
transition       temperature           of    terazosin        and rotigotine          are higher
than the normal storage temperature.                             As such, amorphous forms
of oxybutynin, fentanyl, and scopolamine are more difficult to
stabilize than the amorphous forms of terazosin or rotigotine.
[0049]         Moreover,          Applicants         have      found      that    an   amorphous
drug-in-adhesive              provides        a     higher        skin     flux     relative       to
transdermal          delivery        devices       containing          crystalline        forms    of
an  active      agent       or    active      agents      in    a    subsaturated        solution.
Further,       Applicants            have      discovered            a   method      of     forming
transdermal         delivery        devices       incorporating           amorphous       forms    of

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 [0050]        One      embodiment          of     the     present      invention          is     a
transdermal        delivery          device     comprising        a   backing      layer,       an
adhesive          matrix            layer        comprising          a      supersaturated
concentration          of     at    least    one    active     agent     substantially          in
amorphous form within an adhesive matrix, and a release liner.
 [0051]        As    used       herein,      "transdermal"        means     delivery        of    a
drug   by passage          into and through            the    skin or mucosal          tissue.
Hence     the    terms         "transdermal"         and     "transmucosal"         are      used
interchangeably unless                specifically        stated otherwise.           Likewise
the terms "skin,"             "derma,"      "epidermis",         "mucosa,"     and the like
shall    also be used interchangeably                     unless     specifically        stated
otherwise.
 [0052]        The     backing         layer     is    a   flexible       substrate        which
provides      a   barrier          to   active     drug     migration       away     from      the
intended      direction          of drug      delivery.        Any well-known          backing
layer which        satisfies         this purpose        can be used in         the present
invention.
 [0053]        Preferably,            the     backing        layer      is    composed          of
materials that          are substantially             non-crystallization           promoting
and free of         crystallization            nuclei.        Such backing        layers       aid
in   the   preservation            of   the   amorphous        drug-in-adhesive          matrix
by  preventing         crystal        formation.         Examples      of materials          from
which    the    backing         layer may be         composed      include     polyethylene
terephthalate,            various         nylons,       polypropylenes,         polyesters,
polyester/ethylene-vinyl                  acetates,      metalized      polyester        films,
polyvinylidene          chloride,         metal    films     such    as   aluminum       foils,
polyvinylidene            fluoride         films,      or    mixtures       or    copolymers
thereof.

 [0055]        Silicone         coated      polyethylene          backings,         such     as
Mediflex@ 1000 coated with a silicone                       layer,      3 MT" Cotran@ 9722
coated with a silicone layer, and 3MT" Cotran m 9720 coated with
a    silicone     layer,     preserve      the   amorphous       form      of   the   drug   in
the     adhesive      matrix.         Similarly,       silicone        coated      polyester
backings, such as Mediflex@ 1200 coated with a silicone layer,
also preserves the amorphous form of drug in adhesive.
 [0056]        In    some    embodiments,        the    backing       layer      may   be  the
same     size as the adhesive matrix layer and/or may be the                              same
size as the release liner.                   In other embodiments, the backing
layer     may be      oversized       as   compared      with    the      adhesive     layer,
i.e.     the backing      layer may be         larger than the            adhesive     layer.
In    yet    other    embodiments,         the    backing     layer       may    range    from
about     0.01mm to at least            10mm larger than the              adhesive matrix
layer,      preferably         ranging      from    about     0.05mm        to    about    5mm
larger      than    the    adhesive       matrix     layer,      and     most     preferably
ranging from about 0.1mm to about 3mm larger than the adhesive
matrix layer.          Use of an oversized backing layer helps prevent
the adhesive matrix from becoming distorted or relaxing during
the     handling       and     shipping       processes.           Such       an   oversized
backing layer may help prevent crystal growth, especially when
the    devices     are   stored      for   long periods        of    time or       when they
are exposed to temperature fluctuations.

agent,       preferably       ranging        from     about     20%    to   about    80%      by
weight       of    the     total      amount        of     active     agent,      and      most
preferably        ranging     from     about      40% to      about    60% by weight          of
the total amount of active agent.
 [0080]         The    adhesive      matrix       layer     may    contain    one   or     more
additives         selected        from       tackifiers,          cohesive      enhancers,

other       pharmaceutically          acceptable          additives       or   excipients.
The    additives       are   generally         present     in   the   composition       in    an
amount      ranging     from     about      1% to      about     50% by     weight    of     the
adhesive matrix layer, and preferably ranging from about 2% to
about 25% by weight of the adhesive matrix layer.
 [0081]         In    some     embodiments,           the     adhesive       matrix      layer
contains       one    or more      tackifiers.            As   used    herein,     the     term
"tackifier"        refers    to materials           other than PIB that          are added
to     adhesives       to    increase         their      tack     or   stickiness.            If
tackifiers        are    included,         they     are    generally       present     in     an
amount      ranging     from     about      1% to     about      50% by     weight    of     the
adhesive      matrix     layer,      preferably         from about      5% to    about       40%
by     weight      of    the     adhesive         matrix      layer.      Tackifiers         are
generally       comprised       of   materials        such     as   naturally     occurring
resinous,        rosinous       materials,           or    truly     synthetic       polymer
materials.          Examples       of     tackifiers         include     hydrogenated         or
partially hydrogenated glycerol esters of rosin, polyterpenes,
polybutenes, or polysiloxanes.
[0082]          In    some     embodiments,           the     adhesive      matrix       layer
contains       one   or more       cohesive        enhancers.        The    addition      of    a

 [0087]        In    some     embodiments,       the    release        liner      may   be   the

 [0088]        Use   of an oversized             release       liner helps prevent               the
adhesive matrix from becoming distorted or relaxing during the
handling      and    shipping        processes.          Such       an     oversized       release
liner    may    help     prevent        crystal       growth,         especially        when     the
transdermal        delivery        devices      are    stored         for     long   periods        of
time,   are    exposed to          temperature        fluctuations,             or are     exposed
to   shipping       and/or      moving       stresses.             For      example,      when      an
adhesive      matrix     is     laminated        between        a    backing       layer     and     a
release     liner     that     is    the    same     size     as     the     adhesive      matrix,
coupled with        heat    curing,       crystal      growth        is    observed      to   start
from   the     edge    of    the     patch     and    progress           toward     the    center.
However, when that same adhesive matrix is laminated between a
backing     layer      and    an     oversized        release         liner,      coupled       with
heat   curing,      there      is    no   observed       crystal           growth    even     after
the patch is stored for two months, subjected to ten cycles of
freeze    and     thaw    stability        testing,        or      subjected        to   repeated
microscopic observations.
[0089]         In   one     embodiment,           the    adhesive            matrix     layer       is
laminated      between      an    oversized release              liner       and an oversized
backing     layer.         In     another      embodiment,            the      adhesive     matrix
layer    is    laminated         between       an    oversized            release      liner     and
backing    layer     of the same          size as the adhesive                  layer.      In yet
another     embodiment,           the    adhesive       matrix          layer     is    laminated
between an oversized release liner and a backing layer of the
same size as the adhesive layer with an overlay film above the
backing     layer.       If     an overlay         film    is      utilized,        the    overlay
may be the same material                 or may be a different material                         than
the release liner.

 [0090]         The     overlay        is    typically          the   same      size      as    the
oversized        release     liner,       but    larger      in   size     than   the     backing
layer.         The    overlay       layer     may     be   about     0.01mm      to    at    least
about    20mm      larger    than the         diameter        of a   round backing           layer

 [0091]         The    transdermal         delivery       device     may      include      one   or
more    additional          layers.           One     such      additional        layer      is    a
reservoir        layer.      Preferably, the reservoir                    layer is composed
of    materials          that       are      free      of      crystallization            seeding
particles.               The    reservoir         layer      may    contain      one     or   more
active      agents       and    one     or     more      pharmaceutically            acceptable
additives.
 [0092]         In   general,        the   reservoir         layer   is     a  layer     that    is
placed     between       a  backing        film     and    a    drug   release       regulating
membrane        layer.        In      such    an     example,       the     reservoir        layer
contains       an    amount     of     active     agent       which    is     higher     than    an
amount     of     active     agent      present       in    an    adhesive       matrix      layer
 (which    is    located     between        the    membrane       layer     and   the     release
liner).         The   active      agent(s)       may be        in  amorphous        form in      an
adhesive matrix or in a gel in the reservoir layer.                                     The skin

 [0096]        The transdermal delivery device unit dosage form may

comprises      the     following     steps:    first,      the active agent             and an
adhesive      polymer       are  dissolved       in    a  solvent       system      so   as  to

agent   in     the adhesive matrix                solution is        cast to at         least one

removed      from      the     adhesive         matrix     solution       at   a    temperature
which   is     at,    below,       or above        the   melting point         of the active
agent    to     spontaneously             form    the   supersaturated          concentration
of amorphous drug-in-adhesive matrix; and fourth, the other of
a   release         liner      or       a   backing      film      is    laminated          to   the
supersaturated            active        agent    in   the    adhesive       matrix,        so   that
the   supersaturated              active        agent    in    the     adhesive        matrix     is
between     the      release       liner      and the     backing       layer.        The     active
agent   may       be any      active        pharmaceutical         ingredient         capable     of
being    including           in    an      amorphous      form     within      a    transdermal

rotigotine.            In    preferred         embodiments,        the    drug     is     selected
from oxybutynin, piroxicam, fentanyl, naltrexone, scopolamine,
or a steroid.
[0098]          In one embodiment               of this     first     method,      the      release
liner     and/or          the     backing         layers       are     non-crystallization

embodiment         of   this     first       method,     the    supersaturated            drug-in
adhesive-matrix            contains         one   or   more     additives      or     excipients
which are        dissolved        or undissolved but dispersed                   as liquid        or
solid particles in the adhesive matrix.                            The amount of solvent
necessary        for this       method        ranges    from about        1% to       about     200%
more  than        the    amount        of   solvent     necessary        to   solubilize         the
drug   and      adhesive.           The      solvent     may    be    chosen     from       organic
solvents including pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, octanes, ethyl
acetate,      ethanol,        isopropanol,           toluene,       xylenes      and      mixtures
thereof.           For    the    adhesive         system,      if   the    type     of      solvent
present in the adhesive matrix solution has a lower solubility
for  the     drug     than     for       the   adhesive,      a   second      solvent        may be
added to      dissolve both              the   drug and the         adhesive.          The ratio
of  the    first       solvent         to   the    second     solvent      is   the      ratio    at

 [0099]         A    second       method       of    preparing         an     adhesive       matrix
 containing        at    least     one    active       agent     that     is     supersaturated
and     present      in   amorphous        form    comprises         the     following       steps:
admixing        the      active      agent       with     an     adhesive         matrix      at     a
 supersaturated concentration;                   heating the adhesive matrix to a
temperature          which     allows       the    active      agent       to    be     completely
dissolved in the adhesive melt, or melted and finely dispersed
in    the adhesive         matrix,      to create a hot melt;                  casting the hot
melt     to   at    least     one    of   a   release      liner      or    a backing        layer;
and laminating the other of a release liner or a backing layer
to the      hot melt,        so    that    the hot melt           is   between        the   release
liner     and     the    backing       layer.        As   the     hot    melt      is    cooled   to
ambient      temperature,          the    amorphous        drug-in-adhesive              matrix   is
spontaneously            formed,      whereby        the     solid      amorphous          drug   is
finely dispersed in the adhesive matrix.                             The active agent may
be     any    active       pharmaceutical             ingredient         capable         of   being
including        in    an   amorphous        form within         a   transdermal          delivery
device.        In    preferred        embodiments,         the     drug     is    selected      from
oxybutynin, piroxicam, fentanyl, naltrexone, scopolamine, or a
steroid.
 [0100]         In one embodiment of this first method, the hot melt
contains        one      or    more      additives         or      excipients          which     are
dissolved or undissolved but dispersed in the adhesive matrix.
 [0101]         In    another       embodiment         of   this      method,         the   release
liner     and the        backing     layer      are non-crystallization                  promoting
and free of crystallization nuclei.
 [0102]         Crystalline             forms        of       drugs        are         the     most
thermodynamically             stable      forms.       As   a    result,        drug     molecules
will     self-organize          themselves        in    such     a   structurally           ordered

energy.      Under thermodynamically favored conditions, amorphous
forms    of   drugs      or less         favored        crystal       forms      will      eventually
convert     to     the     most      stable        crystal       form.        One    way      in    which
crystallization             or    conversion             may      occur         is     through           the
presence       of       pre-existing             drug       crystals           or      other         solid
particles         (nuclei)       present           in     the      adhesive          matrix         which
provide support for crystal growth formation.                                     This process is
termed     crystal          seeding.             Thus,        to     avoid        crystal         growth
formation,        a    backing       layer       and/or       a   release         liner       that       are
non-crystallization              promoting             and      free      of      crystallization
nuclei     is     utilized.             Such       a    non-crystallization                  promoting
backing     layer       and/or     a    non-crystallization                  release        liner       has
been    shown       to   prevent         crystal         formation           and    growth         in     an
amorphous      drug-in-adhesive-matrix.                         Moreover,          utilization            of
an oversized backing layer                    or an oversized               release liner             in   a
patch may further avoid crystallization of the amorphous form.
Indeed,     use      of   such    an oversized              release        liner      or     oversized
backing     layer       helps    prevent          the    edge     of     the     adhesive         matrix
from   becoming         distorted         or    relaxing         during        the    handling          and
shipping     processes          or    when       the     devices        are     stored       for      long
periods of time or are exposed to temperature fluctuations.
 [0103]       A     solid     drug      can     exist      in    one     or     more     crystalline
forms   and     in     amorphous        form.         Structurally            ordered       molecules
form   crystals.            Of   all      the      possible        crystalline            forms,        one
crystalline         form     is   most       thermodynamically                 stable      among        the
crystalline forms.               The amorphous form of a drug, however, is
meta stable, meaning it is thermodynamically unstable.                                            Unlike
crystalline         forms,      amorphous          drug     molecules           are    structurally
organized     in      a random order.                Under thermodynamically favored
conditions,         the    less      stable       crystalline            forms      and     amorphous
form   will     eventually         convert          to    the    most      stable        crystalline
form.       Precisely         how      long      a    drug      retains         the    meta       stable

initiate.            As     such,     a   method     of    reestablishing         the   internal
adhesive          matrix      environment         for    the    amorphous      form    comprises
heat curing            a die-cut        patch at a particular             temperature       for a
sufficient           period       of    time.       Preferably,        the    heat    curing    is
done      at     the     temperature        of    the    melting      point     of   the   active
agent       up to       a   temperature        about     20'C above       the melting point
of    the       active       agent.        Preferably,         the    heat   curing      is   done
either         after      die-cutting         and    after      packaging      or   after     die
cutting          and     before      packaging.           Preferably,        heat     curing    is
performed           before         any     crystals         are     formed      or    before      a
substantial             amount       of    crystals        are     formed.         Heat    curing
sources include oven electric heating and infra-red beams.

[0106]            In      examples        1   through         9,    the   active       agent    is

polysiloxane adhesive matrix with a solvent method
 [0108]           In    this     example,        42.84       grams of Bio-PSA             7-4302      (60%
polysiloxane            adhesive         solid dissolved             in    ethyl acetate),           7.00
grams      of micronized              oxybutynin          base,      1.00     grams    of    isopropyl
palmitate          and     1.20      grams      of     colloidal         silicon      dioxide       (CSD)
were added to a glass                    jar.       After the contents were sonicated
for 1 minute, the solid was admixed with a wood spatula.                                               The
content was further sonicated for 9 minutes to solvate the CSD
and stirred            with   a mechanical             mixer     for 3 minutes.             After the
glass      jar     was rolled overnight                  to remove air,            a liquid blend,
containing          dispersed          CSD and some           undissolved          oxybutynin base
crystals,            was     obtained.                 The      blend       was      coated       to     a
fluropolymer             coated       release        liner      Scotchpak TM 1022,            dried     at
room      temperature          for      5    min.     and    at   50'C      for    90   minutes.         A
polyester         backing        film       (Mediflex        1200,      smooth     polyester side)
was     laminated to           the      dry adhesive.                The laminate was opaque
right       after       it   was      made      and     became      clear,       containing        dense
fine clear crystals.                    The crystals were observed both visually
and     microscopically.                   A   three-layer          patch      was    made     by    die
cutting          the       laminate.              The      drug-in-adhesive               matrix       was
sandwiched between                 a backing          film and a          release      liner.          The
composition             of    the       dry      adhesive        matrix         is    described         in

 WO 2008/115371                                                          PCT/US2008/003221
matrix    was      higher    than     its   solubility          (about     3% by      weight),
the  drug       was    saturated       in   the      adhesive      matrix.         Thus,      the
adhesive       matrix     contained       both     dissolved       oxybutynin        base     and
undissolved oxybutynin base.                   In this example, the undissolved
oxybutynin        base   was    present      in    crystalline        form dispersed           in
the  adhesive        matrix.        As    such,       the   patch    was     a   crystalline
drug-in-adhesive           matrix     patch.         In   example     1,    the    oxybutynin
base   crystals         were    not     completely         dissolved       in    the      blend.
Therefore,        the   blend    contained         dissolved       oxybutynin        base     and
undissolved         oxybutynin       base     crystals,        i.e.     the    blend       was   a
saturated        solution      of    oxybutynin          base.       This      was     done    by
controlling         the   ratio     of    oxybutynin         base    to    ethyl      acetate.
The    undissolved           oxybutynin           base       crystals,          which        were
crystallization           nuclei,       promoted        fast     recrystallization             of
dissolved        oxybutynin        base     after       the     solvent       was     removed.
Because      the     drying     temperature            (500 C)    was     lower     than      the
melting     point      of   oxybutynin        base      crystals,       crystals        carried
over   from      the    blend     and     crystals        formed     during      the      drying
process were not melted.

[0110]          The    composition         of    the      adhesive       matrix       in     this
example     is    described      in    Table     1.      The   laminate       and patch        of
example    2 were prepared           similarly         to example       1.     The patch of
example 2 is a crystalline drug-in-adhesive matrix patch.

[0112]         The    adhesive      matrix       for     this    example       was    prepared
similarly       to   example     1,   but    Bio-PSA       7-4302     was    replaced        with
Bio-PSA        7-4301.          Bio-PSA         7-4301       is    a     solution          of    a
polysiloxane adhesive in heptane. The polysiloxane in Bio-PSA
7-4301    is     exactly     the    same     as     the    polysiloxane         adhesive       in
Bio-PSA7-4302.              Because       heptane         is    a   poor       solvent        for
oxybutynin base, most of the oxybutynin base crystals were not

dissolved       in    the    blend.          The     undissolved           oxybutynin        base
crystals        seeded      fast       recrystallization                of     pre-dissolved
oxybutynin base.            The    patch obtained           was      a   crystalline        drug
in-adhesive matrix laminate.

 [0114]        In    this     example,        89.53       grams       of    Bio-PSA       7-4302
 (60.2%     polysiloxane           adhesive         solid        dissolved           in     ethyl
acetate),       12.25     grams      of    micronized         oxybutynin          base,       1.75
grams    of   isopropyl      palmitate,        2.10     grams of         colloidal      silicon
dioxide     (CSD) and 10.73 grams of additional ethyl acetate were
added to a glass jar.              After the contents were sonicated for 1
minute,     the    contents      were     admixed       with     a    wood   spatula.          The
contents     were     further     sonicated        for     9 minutes        to   solvate       the
CSD    and    stirred     with     a   mechanical          mixer       for    3   minutes       to
dissolve the entire oxybutynin base.                        After the glass jar was
rolled     overnight      to    remove       air,     a    liquid       blend,      containing
dispersed CSD and no undissolved oxybutynin base crystals, was
obtained.         The    blend      was     coated       to    a    fluropolymer          coated
release     liner     Scotchpak@       1022,      dried     at     room    temperature         for
4 min.,     and   at   500C    for    90 min,       or dried         at   room temperature
for   4 min,     at   400C for      4   min and at          850C for        15   minutes.         A
polyester      backing     film     (Mediflex        1200,     smooth polyester             side)
was  laminated       to the      dry adhesive.              The      laminate was         opaque
and  free     of oxybutynin        crystals        immediately after             it   was made
and remained opaque and free of                    oxybutynin crystals.                 Because
the   blend     contained       no    undissolved          oxybutynin        base      crystals
and because the adhesive contact side of the backing film is a
non-crystallization            promoting          polyester           side      and     further
because     the     silicone      coated       side      of    release       liner      (smooth
fluropolymer        coated     side)     is    a   non-crystallization               promoting
silicone     coating     on polyester,           the    laminate        obtained was         free
of oxybutynin base crystals.                   Since      the    drug concentration             in
the   adhesive       matrix     was     higher      than      its      solubility        (3%    by

 Thus,     the    adhesive matrix            contained        both dissolved           oxybutynin
 base     and    undissolved          oxybutynin        base.       In    this    example,          the
 undissolved           oxybutynin         base     was     present       in   amorphous           form
 dispersed         in     the     adhesive         matrix.          The      laminate         is      an
 amorphous          drug-in-adhesive              matrix       laminate.             Microscopic
 observation          indicates        there      were     no   crystals      present        in     the
 adhesive matrix.

 similarly       to     Example       4.     The     adhesive      matrix      was     sandwiched

15.16 grams of polybutene,                1.20 grams of 1,3-butene                 glycol       and
2.00  grams     of dipropylene           glycol       were       added to a jar.               2.00
grams   of    colloidal       silicon       dioxide      was      added    under     stirring.
7.00   grams      of    micronized        oxybutynin         base      and   an     additional
36.98    grams      of   heptane      were      added.         After     the     mixture        was
mixed,    the   jar    was rolled overnight              to remove        trapped air.             A
liquid      blend,       containing          dispersed           CSD     and      undissolved
oxybutynin base          crystals,      was     obtained.          The blend was coated
to a silicone         coated release liner, dried at                     room temperature
for  5 min.      and at      500*C    for     90 minutes.            A polyester backing
film   (Mediflex@ 1200,           smooth polyester side) was                    laminated to
the dry adhesive.              The laminate was clear right after it was
made   and    became      opaque    containing          dense       fine    crystals.           The
crystals were observed visually and microscopically.                                   A three
layer patch is made by die-cutting the laminate.                                The drug-in
adhesive     matrix       is   sandwiched         between        a   backing      film      and    a
release liner.            The composition of the dry adhesive matrix is
described in table 2.                Because the drug concentration in the
adhesive matrix was higher than its solubility                             (3% by weight),
the drug was supersaturated in the adhesive matrix.                                  Thus, the
PIB  adhesive       matrix      contained        both    dissolved        oxybutynin           base
and   undissolved           oxybutynin         base.          In     this     example,          the
undissolved oxybutynin base was present in crystalline form in
the PIB matrix.            The patch was          a crystalline          drug-in-adhesive
matrix patch.          In example 8, the oxybutynin base crystals were
not  completely        dissolved       in    the    blend      containing        heptane,        in
which   oxybutynin         base   has     a   low    solubility.            Therefore,          the
blend    contained         dissolved        oxybutynin           base    and     undissolved
oxybutynin       base      crystals,        i.e.     the      blend      is     a    saturated
solution of oxybutynin base.                    The undissolved oxybutynin base
crystals,      which       constituted         crystallization            seeds,       promoted
fast  recrystallization            of dissolved          oxybutynin         base after          the
solvent    was    removed.         Because       the   drying        temperature          (5000C)

drug-in-PIB adhesive matrix with a solvent method
 [0120]        The       adhesive        matrices        of   examples        11   and    12   were
prepared       similarly            to     example        10.        The     compositions         of
examples 11 and 12 matrices are described in Table 2.

adhesive matrix by heating
 [0122]        The      laminate        of   this     example      was prepared similarly
to the example             10 laminate.            After the adhesive was ^coated on
release       liner           Medirelease@             2249,       the      adhesive        matrix
containing        undissolved           oxybutynin         base    crystals       was   dried     at
room temperature for 5 minutes, and for 12 minutes at 85 0 C.                                      A
smooth      backing            film      Mediflex®         1200      polyester        side       was
laminated to the adhesive.                      The laminate was clear and free of
crystals     in     the     beginning,         but dense        crystals       formed     a month
after it was prepared.                   This indicated that if the drug is not
completely       dissolved          in    the     wet    adhesive      blend,     heating      at   a
temperature         even        above      the      drug's     melting        point    will      not
evenly    disperse           the    drug     molecules         as   fine     particles       in   an
adhesive     matrix          or    form     a    stable     amorphous        drug-in-adhesive

 and   the    jar     was   rolled     overnight       to     remove     trapped       air,     a
 liquid     blend,      containing       dispersed       CSD       and    no    undissolved
oxybutynin       base     crystals,     was obtained.            The blend was coated
to a silicone coated Medirelease@ 2249 release liner, dried at
room temperature           for 4 minutes and at             500C for       90 minutes;        or
at room temperature for 4 minutes, at 85*C for 15 minutes, and
at   4000C     for    4 minutes.        A polyester        backing       film     (Mediflex@
 1200,     smooth       polyester       side)     was      laminated          to    the      dry
adhesive.             The   laminate     was     clear     and      free    of    oxybutynin
crystals       after     it   was   made    and    remained         clear     and     free    of
oxybutynin          crystals.           Because       the       blend       contained         no
undissolved oxybutynin base crystals seeding recrystallization
after      the     solvent      was    removed,       and      because       the     adhesive
contact     side     of   the   backing     film     (smooth       polyester       side)     and
the   adhesive        contact     side   of    release       liner     (smooth       silicone
coated      side)      were     non-crystalline         promoting,           the     laminate
obtained      was     free   of oxybutynin         base     crystals.          Because       the
drug concentration           in   the adhesive matrix was higher                    than its
solubility        (3% by weight),        the    drug was        supersaturated          in   the
adhesive matrix.            Thus, the PIB adhesive matrix contained both
dissolved oxybutynin base and undissolved oxybutynin base.                                     In
this    example,       the   undissolved       oxybutynin         base    was present         in
amorphous        form     in    the    PIB    matrix.           The    laminate          is   an
amorphous        drug-in-adhesive          matrix      laminate.            Microscopical
observation         indicates     there    were     no   crystals        present       in    the
adhesive matrix.
 [0125]        Examples      15   and   17   are    prepared        similar      to   Example

 [0127]       In    this   example          the    adhesive        matrix        was     prepared
with a hot melt          extrusion         method.        The extrusion temperature
was   11000C     at   which    both       the    PIB,     polybutene         and      oxybutynin
base were melted.           CSD and the            glycols       were dispersed              in   the
adhesive.          The    entire        oxybutynin          base     was        dissolved          or
dispersed      in    the  adhesive          matrix      at    molecular          level      at    the
extrusion temperature.             A thin film of the matrix was extruded
to a smooth       release     liner and laminated with a smooth release
liner.
 [0128]       The    laminate      obtained         in    Example      16     was      clear      and
free   of   oxybutynin      base      crystals        and remained           clear       and     free
of oxybutynin base crystals.                      Because the drug concentration
in  the   adhesive      matrix     was      higher      than its      solubility              (3% by
weight),     the    drug   was    supersaturated             in   the   adhesive           matrix.
Thus,     the     PIB    adhesive          matrix        contained        both         dissolved
oxybutynin       base    and    undissolved            oxybutynin       base.             In     this
example,      the     undissolved           oxybutynin          base    was         present        in
amorphous      form dispersed          in    the    PIB matrix.           The       laminate       is
an amorphous       drug-in-adhesive             matrix      laminate.           Microscopical
observation       indicates      there       were      no   crystals       present          in    the
adhesive matrix.
[0129]        In Vitro Flux Data
[0130]        In    vitro    flux       studies       were      performed          using        Franz
cells    and     Human    Cadaver         Epidermis         in    incubators            at      320C.

 [0134]        Moreover,      crystallization             did    not        occur    when     the
same amorphous oxybutynin base-in-silicone adhesive matrix was
laminated between a fluropolymer coated release liner                                  (such as

 [0135]        Similarly,         crystallization              of         oxybutynin         base
occurred       when   an    amorphous         oxybutynin        base-in-PIB           adhesive

occur when the         same   amorphous         oxybutynin       base-in-PIB          adhesive

were die-cut and pouched and stored at 22'C and 40'C.
 [0136]           As   shown       in    Tables       6 and 7,          it    has     been discovered
that die-cutting destabilizes the amorphous form of oxybutynin
base in an adhesive matrix.                          As such, crystallization occurred
on    the     edge     of patch         and progressed                towards        the    center.          It
has     also      been     discovered           that      delamination             (peeling          off   the
release        liner     and     replacing it            with the same             release         liner     or
with a new piece                of release          liner) destabilized                  the amorphous
form      of     oxybutynin         base     in     adhesive          matrix.          Thus,       crystals
formed        in     about      a    5%   area       of     the      patch      over      three        weeks.
Moreover,           the    crystals          formed         randomly          in     the     delaminated
patch.           The    amount        of   crystals           and     rate     of     crystallization
were dependent on the peeling force.
[0137]            It has also been discovered that heat-curing die-cut
patches,          with    or     without        back       slitting         and     with      or     without
delamination            restabilizes             the      amorphous           form      of     oxybutynin
base in adhesive matrices and prevents the amorphous drug from
crystallizing.
[0138]            In    Tables        6    and      7,     the      stability          of     heat       cured
patches        were compared            to the stability                of the patches               with an

discovered that heat curing at a temperature above the melting

adhesive         matrix.          Thus,      no     crystal         growth      was     observed          even

after     the     heat-cured        patches     were      aged   for  3   months      at     room
temperature          or    40'C       for    the     polysiloxane         based      adhesive
matrices.
 [0139]          When    comparing       the    stability       of   heat-cured        patches
in which the release liner is of the same size as the adhesive
layer, it was found that no crystals were observed for patches
newly     removed      from pouches         at    each of the       time    points       (1,   2,
3, 6, 8 months) for microscopy observation.                           However, crystals
were observed on the patches that were removed from pouches at
earlier       time points because             the    adhesive      edge   was    in    contact
on    the    pouch    and    the process         of removing        the   patch      from the
pouch     damaged       the   edge      of  adhesive.          As   such,    damaging         the
edge     of    adhesive     initiated       crystallization.             However,       use    of
an oversized         release       liner in      contact with the          adhesive        layer
prevented         the    edge     of    adhesive        from   contacting       the     pouch.
Moreover,         when     an     oversized        released       liner     was      used      in
combination         with    heat      curing,      crystallization         was     prevented
during      the    handling       process.        In    addition,     crystal       formation
of     heat-cured        patches       did     not      occur    after     10    cycles        of
freezing        and   thawing.         These     results      indicate      the    amorphous
form of oxybutynin base in an adhesive matrix of an undie-cut
laminate        is   stable       for    a  sufficient         period    of   time.           The
results also indicate the amorphous form of oxybutynin base in
an    adhesive       matrix      in    a   heat-cured        die-cut     patch,       with     or
without       back    slitting        and   with      or    without    delamination,           is
stable for a sufficient period of time.

 [0140]        Polarized      light   microscopy       analysis      was     performed
with    an     Olympus     BX51.      Differential        scanning       Calorimetry
 ("DSC")     and Modualted      DSC were performed with            a TA Q-1000       DSC
instrument,        and    were    used     to   characterize         the     amorphous
oxybutynin       base-in-adhesive       matrix,     and   to    determine      whether
crystals were present in the laminates and patches.
[0141]         The   DSC   of   the  crystalline       oxybutynin       base    powder
showed     a   sharp  endothermic      melting     peak   at    about    56 0 C and no
glass transition temperature between -90                  to 80'C.       The melt in
the DSC pan obtained from the first                 run was     rapidly cooled to
-900 C,  and then the temperature was ramped from about -90 0 C to
about 800 C.      This melt showed a glass transition temperature at
about    -20oC,    but   no   endothermic     melting peak,         indicating       the
melt was in amorphous form.              The DSC of crystalline oxybutynin
base-in-silicone        adhesives     showed     an  endothermic       melting      peak
and a Tg at about -1200C,           which is    believed to be the Tg of the
silicone      adhesive     containing      some   dissolved      oxybutynin       base.

The     DSC    of    amorphous         oxybutynin        base-in-silicone            adhesive
showed a Tg at about -120*C, which is believed to be the Tg of
a silicone       adhesive       containing        dissolved       oxybutynin base,          and
a   Tg    at    about    -20  0 C,     which    is    believed       to     be   the     Tg  of
dispersed       amorphous       oxybutynin         base.      For    patches       that    were
not     heat     cured,      crystals         were     observed        visually        and   by
microscopy        on    the     edge     of    patch.         DSC     of     the    partially
crystallized        patches      showed      two    glass    transition        temperatures
 (at -120      and   -20 0C    regions,       respectively)         and     an endothermic
melt    peak.        This     is     consistent       with     the    presence        of   both
crystalline       oxybutynin         base     and   amorphous       oxybutynin        base   in
the partially crystallized patches.
 [0142]        Example     59      (transdermal delivery              device      comprising
scopolamine       as an active agent):               23.83    grams of ethyl acetate
were    added to      4 grams of scopolamine               free base.          The solution
was    stirred      until     the      scopolamine        crystals        were    completely
dissolved.         To this      solution,       92.31     grams     of    PIB   solution     in
heptane       (25%   polymer        solid)     was    added.         The     admixture      was
mixed with       a propeller         at   high speed        for    3 minutes       to   form a
uniform solution.            However, after the solution was rolled over
for   1 hour,      many crystals          formed.       Thus,      27.11     grams    of more
ethyl      acetate       were         added      to     completely           dissolve       the
scopolamine         crystals        and     form     a   uniform        solution.           The
solution remained to be clear after it was rolled overnight to
remove     trapped      air.        The    viscous      solution       was     coated     to   a
release      liner    Medirelease@         2249,      dried    in    an    over    to   remove

solution      (only colloidal silicon dioxide was dispersed and all
other     ingredients        were   dissolved).          After        the        solution        was
rolled     overnight        to  remove      trapped     air,        it       was      coated       to
