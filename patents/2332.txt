ABSTRACT:
SOLAR POWERED SMART MANHOLE COVERS HAS SOLER CELL
MOUNTED ON THE TOP OF MANHOLE WHICH CHARGE THE
BATTERY AND BATTERY GIVES POWER TO THE SENSOR AND
COMMUNICATE FROM ONE END TO OTHER END. SMART MANHOLE
COVER HAS RELIEF VALVE ON THE TOP FOR RELEASING ANY
PRESSURIZED FLUID FROM PITS. THESE SENSORS DETECT THE
LEVEL OF GASES IN THE PIT BEFORE OPENING THE PIT AND
PREVENT THE DIASTER HAPPENING. EVERY HARDWARE AND
ELECTRONIC DEVICES ARE INBUIT THE COVER.

SOLAR POWERED SMART (INTELLIGENT) MANHOLE COVER
SOLAR POWERED Smart (intelligent manhole covers) with solar cells:
    1. SMART INTELLIGENT MANHOLE COVERS are used in any industry such as
        electrical industry, water industry, gas industry, telecommunication industry etc etc.
        these manhole covers are used for residential and commercial purpose.
    2. For residential purpose we can use Wireless internet or GSM or GPRS technology.
        These manhole covers are watertight proof. So, their main purpose to reduce the cost
        of waste water treatment in terms of infiltration and inflow process.
    3. If manhole covers are pressurized with any fluid material, then there is small relief
        kind of valve mounted on the top of manhole cover to escape fluid.Fluid is any kind
        of mixture such as air or water. This valve is fitted on the top of manhole cover and it
        is one-way valve. Any fluid in term of gas or water does not go in the pit but any
        excess gas or water can escape from the pit.
    4. These manhole covers detect gas and level of gas such as methane, LPG, natural gas
        etc etc for gas industry, overflow water and check the flowrate of water if there is
        breakdown of water pipe in somewhere for water industry. Detect the water in pits for
        telecommunication industry because water is in the pits and slow down the internet
        when copper wire joints touch with water.
    5. Sensor is placed behind inbuilt with manhole cover. Sensors are different for different
        applications for different industries. Most of the sensors are water proof mounted in
        securely in mounting box and can be worked under different temperature conditions
        and extreme weather conditions. Solar cells are placed at the top of the manhole cover
        in safe place, does not contact with the load.
    6. Solar cell charges the battery which gives the power to operate the Sensor and
        electronic device send the data to another end.Solar cell will be placed to charge the
        battery. In future these solar cells can contribute to generate small amount of energy
        for giving power to low volt bulbs as well.
    7. Solar cells are mounted securely on top of manhole covers and can be worked under
        shadows as well. Smart manhole covers are anti-theft device and it can be easily
        tracked with GPS technology. So, customer knows straight way if someone trying to
        steal. All these features and hardware's are inbuilt in cover.
These smart manhole covers are very useful for councils and water industries to monitor
rainwater and flood water in terms to find the blockage or broken pipe in different
locations.SMART MANHOLE COVER saves cost for infiltration and inflow. These manhole
covers detect the leakage of any gas too and send the leakage level signal to customers in
terms of messaging, via email or via internet in residential areas. Application has being made
for communication from one end to other end. These applications are user friendly for
computers (laptop and desktop) and android, ios phones.
