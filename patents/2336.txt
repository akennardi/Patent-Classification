Technical Field
[0001]    The invention relates to a method for reducing renal hypertension and a
computer-readable medium utilizing such method.

100021    Renovascular hypertension (or "renal hypertension") is a condition of high
blood pressure due to kidney's hormonal response to narrowing renal arteries which is
caused by parenchymal renal diseases and/or renal artery diseases. When the renal
arteries become narrow to result in less blood flow, the kidney may mistakenly send
messages via the renal sympathetic nerves to the brain. In response to these messages,
the brain will increase cardiac output and cause high blood pressure. Treatments of the
renal hypertension includes medication therapy to help control blood pressure and
surgical therapy. The surgical therapy of the renal hypertension usually can include
balloon angioplasty and stent implantation of kidney arteries.
[0003]    However, in terms of medication therapy, the efficacy of medicine is often
getting worse with progression of the disease, and it may also cause kidney atrophy in
the long term aspect. As to surgical therapy, balloon angioplasty may improve the
narrowing of kidney arteries. However, the cure rate of the hypertension by stent
implantation of kidney arteries is less than 30%, and the patients may still be required
to continue to receive antiplatelet drugs and to strengthen the control of blood
pressure and lipids.

[0004]    As shown in Fig. 22, in the rat model of neuropathic pain provided by
Ronen Shechter et al. (Ronen Shechter et al. (2013, August), Conventional and
Kilohertz-frequency      Spinal    Cord      Stimulation      Produces       Intensity- and
Frequency-dependent Inhibition of Mechanical Hypersensitivity in a Rat Model of
Neuropathic Pain, ANESTHESIOLOGY, 119(2), 422-32), the rats with spinal cord
injuries were received an electrical stimulation with frequency of 50Hz to 10kHz for
thirty minutes (80% MoT, constant current, current intensity 0.6 mA-0.7 mA). The
paw withdraw thresholds started to drop at 30 minutes after end of the electrical
stimulation. Also, it is noted that the paw withdraw thresholds returned to
pre-stimulation level at 5 days after the last electrical stimulation. In other words, such
conventional electrical stimulation did not provide a long term effect. Patients may
have to receive such electrical stimulation for every 4-5 days (or even several times
for one day) so as to continuously ameliorate the symptoms caused by neural
hypersensitivity. However, such treatment will make patients more and more
uncomfortable and also increase the inconvenience of the treating course.
100051    In addition, US Patent No. 8,131,372              discloses a method to treat
hypertension and renal failure by stimulating the renal nerve. In this method, an
electrode is placed adjacent to the renal sympathetic nerve. The renal nerve is then
ablated so as to reduce sympathetic activities of kidney nerves, which results in a
reduction in blood pressure of the patient. However, ablation of nerves is a destructive
therapy, and once the nerve regenerates, the patient may suffer a higher blood pressure
than before ablation of the kidney nerves.
100061    Moreover, US Patent No. 7,162,303, as well as US Patent No. 7,647,115,
discloses an electrical therapy to place the electrode adjacent to the renal sympathetic
nerve and to generate an electrical field to stimulate the kidney nerves, so as to reduce

the sympathetic activities of the kidney nerves and help to reduce the blood pressure.
10007]     Therefore, it is important to provide a method for reducing renal
hypertension which can effectively ameliorate symptoms of high blood pressure with
long term effects, without the side effects caused by drugs, and also reduce the
possibility of infection caused by surgical therapies, such as stent implantation and
destructive therapy of ablation.

                DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[0047]     The embodiments of the invention will be apparent from the following
detailed description, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings,
wherein the same references relate to the same elements.
10048]     FIG. 1A is a schematic diagram showing the electrical stimulation device
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                      8         Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

applied to the dorsal root ganglion according to the first embodiment.          Referring to
FIG. IA, an electrical stimulation device 1 is applied to electrically stimulate a target
zone of an organism.      In the embodiment, the target zone is dorsal root ganglion 3
for example.     Alternatively, the target zone may be for example but not limited to
brain, vertebral column, ventral root nerve, root nerve and/or spinal dorsal horn of an
organism.     The vertebral column may be cervical vertebrae, thoracic vertebrae,
lumbar vertebrae, sacral vertebrae, or caudal vertebrae for example.          The following
paragraphs will describe the elements and applications of the electrical stimulation
device 1.
10049]     For the sake of clarity regarding the step details of the method, the circuits
and interaction of the electrical stimulation device I and the controller 2 are explained
first in the following paragraphs.          Then, the following paragraphs          describe
electrically stimulating the target zone of the organism by the electrical stimulation
device    1 of the embodiment.          However, the descriptions          in the following
embodiments are exemplary but not intended to limit the scope of the invention.
[0050]     FIG. 1B is a circuit block diagram of the electrical stimulation device 1 and
the controller 2 in FIG. IA.          Referring to FIG. 1B, a controller 2 provides
configuration parameters and supplies energy for the electrical stimulation device 1.
Because the controller 2 does not need to be implanted in the organism, it may be
called the external controller 2.    Elements of the electrical stimulation device 1 and
the controller 2 and their relationships will be described in the following paragraphs.
10051]     In the embodiment, the electrical stimulation device 1 includes a first
control unit 11 and an electrical stimulation unit 12.      The electrical stimulation unit
12 is coupled to the first control unit 11.     The controller 2 includes a second control
unit 21, a human-computer interface 22 and a power supply unit 23.                      The
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                        9          Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

human-computer interface 22 is coupled to the second control unit 21.           The power
supply unit 23 is also coupled to the second control unit 21 and acts as the power
source of the controller 2.       The power supply unit 23 may be a battery or a
rechargeable battery, or it may be a power adapter connected to mains electricity to
supply electrical power.
[0052]     In the embodiment, the user may use the human-computer interface 22 to
operate the controller 2.       Before beginning, the system default values of the
controller 2 is initialized.  Then, the user may also use the human-computer interface
22 to input the required configuration parameters to the second control unit 21.        In
the embodiment, the human-computer interface 22 may be for example but not limited
to touch button, touch panel, physical button or their combination.            The second
control unit 21 instructs the power supply unit 23 to supply DC power to the elements
of the electrical stimulation device 1 (for example the electrical stimulation unit 12) to
operate.
10053]     The first control unit 11 and the second control unit 21 may be implemented
with digital circuit such as IC (integrated circuit) or implemented with analog circuit.
For example, IC may be a micro-processor, a MCU (microprocessor control unit), a
programmable logic gate array (for example, field-programmable gate array, FPGA,
or complex programmable logic devices, CPLD) or ASIC (application-specific
integrated circuit).    In the embodiment, it is a MCU for example but not limited
thereto.
10054]     In the embodiment, the electrical stimulation device 1 is an implantable
electrical stimulation device for example.       The implantable electrical stimulation
device means that at least one portion of the element of the electrical stimulation
device 1 is implanted in the individual body (e.g., subcutaneous).           Moreover, the
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                       10         Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

electrical stimulation device 1 may be changed to a transcutaneous electrical
stimulation device depending on the symptom and requirement of the patient.           In the
embodiment, the electrical stimulation unit 12 is adapted to be implanted in the
individual.    The first control unit 11 may be implanted within the individual or
disposed outside the individual depending on actual or design requirement.            If the
electrical stimulation unit 12 is prepared to be implanted into one individual, it is
better to implant the device in near the dorsal root ganglion of the spinal nerve
relevant to the patient's pain.   The individual preferably is an organism, and it may
include mammals such as mouse, human, rabbit, cattle, sheep, pig, monkey, dog, cat,
etc.   Preferably, it is human.   For example, it is human.
10055]     As to the configuration of the electrical stimulation unit 12, referring to FIG.
1A and FIG. 2B, the electrical stimulation unit 12 comprises a flexible transmission
lead including at least one first electrode 121 and at least one second electrode 122.
In the embodiment, it includes a pair of electrodes, namely a positive electrode 121
and a negative electrode 122 for example.        In addition, there are maybe two pairs,
three pairs or more than three pairs of electrodes of the electrical stimulation unit 12,
and they may be evenly distributed on the transmission lead, namely the electrical
stimulation unit 12.      The above electrodes operate in bipolar mode to generate an
electric field between the first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122.         In the
embodiment, between the first electrode 121 and the second electrode, there are coils
or wires formed from winding coaxial conductor which are electrically connected to
the electrodes.    For example, the material of the first electrode 121 and the second
electrode 122 may be metal for example platinum, silver, gold or other conductive
metal.    Between the first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122, a zone is
defined by the coils or wires which are compactly wound cable electrically connected
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                      11          Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

to the electrodes.   The first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122 are disposed
at one end of the electrical stimulation unit 12, two contacts 123 acting as the positive
and negative electrodes are disposed at the other end of the electrical stimulation unit
12.   The two contacts 123 are electrically connected or coupled to the first control
unit 11.   The first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122 are respectively linked
to compactly wound coils, and they are linked to the contacts 123 through the wires.
Besides, the wires of the electrical stimulation unit 12 beyond the first electrode 121
and the second electrode 122 is covered by an insulator 120.               In FIG.2A, the
insulator 120 is removed to show the coil disposed between the electrodes in the
electrical stimulation unit 12.
10056]     The range of the individual length a of each electrode depends on actual or
design requirement.       The electrode length a is between 0.5~6mm, preferably
between 1~4mm.       The individual length a of the first electrode 121 and the second
electrode 122 means that the length of the electrode in the direction parallel to the
extension direction of the major axis of the cable of the electrical stimulation unit 12
on the condition that it is not implanted and the electrical stimulation unit 12 is
horizontally spread.    The range of the individual length a of the first electrode 121
and the second electrode 122 depends on actual or design requirement.         For example,
the length a is between 1-3mm.       The distance b between the first electrode 121 and
the second electrode 122 is between 1-7mm or 3-7mm, preferably between 1-4mm.
For example, the distance b of the two adjacent ends of the adjacent first and second
electrodes 121, 122 is preferably between 1-4mm.
100571     A second interval distance c exists between the first electrode 121 and the
second electrode 122 of the electrical stimulation unit 12 and the dorsal root ganglion
3.   The second interval distance c is defined as the shortest distance from the
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                      12         Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

midpoint of the adjacent first and second electrodes 121, 122 to the dorsal root
ganglion 3.      In the embodiment, the second interval distance c ranges from 0 to
10mm, preferably from 0 to 5mm.           If the distance c is 0, the midpoint of the first
electrode 121 and the second electrode 122 in the projection direction overlaps the
dorsal root ganglion 3.
10058]      Referring to FIG. 1C, in the embodiment, the electrical stimulation signal
outputted from the electrical stimulation device 1 may be a continuous sine wave, a
continuous triangle wave or an electrical stimulation signal of high-frequency pulse.
If it is an electrical stimulation pulse signal, one pulse cycle time Tp has a plurality of
pulse signals and at least one period of rest time.           One pulse cycle time is the
reciprocal of pulse repetition frequency.       The pulse repetition frequency (also called
pulse frequency) is between 0~1 KHz, preferably between 1~100 Hz.                     In the
embodiment, the pulse repetition frequency of the electrical stimulation signal is
about 2Hz.       Besides, the duration time Td of pulses in one pulse cycle time is
between 1-250ms, preferably between 10-100ms.             In the embodiment it is 25ms for
example.
[0059]      Referring to FIG. 1C, in the embodiment, the electrical stimulation unit 12
is adapted to transmit a first electrical stimulation signal.      For example, the patient
(or healthcare workers) uses the controller 2 to set the electrical stimulation frequency,
stimulation period, stimulation intensity and/or other parameters of the first electrical
stimulation signal.      Then, the controller 2 outputs the parameters and energy to the
electrical stimulation device 1, and directs the electrical stimulation unit 1 to output
signal via the first control unit 11.      In the embodiment, the frequency of the first
electrical stimulation signal is about 600 KHz.       In other words, its stimulation cycle
time Ts is about 1.67ps.
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                         13        Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

[0060]      For example, the electrical stimulation device may be chosen to be driven in
a constant voltage mode or a constant current mode.           The constant voltage mode is
safer than the constant current mode, but the intensity in the constant voltage mode is
less stable than in the constant current mode.       Choosing which mode depends on the
target zone to be electrically stimulated.     For example, if the target is dorsal column,
the constant current mode is chosen.         If the target is the dorsal root ganglion, the
constant voltage mode is chosen.         When the constant voltage mode is chosen for
driving, the voltage of the first electrical stimulation signal is constant, and the current
of the first electrical stimulation signal varies with the positions and resistances of the
first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122.           Otherwise, when the constant
current mode is chosen for driving, the current of the first electrical stimulation signal
is constant, and the voltage of the first electrical stimulation signal varies with the
positions and resistances of the first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122.       For
example, in the constant voltage mode, the voltage of the first electrical stimulation
signal ranges from -10V to -1V or from 1V to 1OV.             Preferably, the voltage of the
first electrical stimulation signal ranges from 1OV to -3 V or from 3V to IOV.         In the
constant current mode, the current of the first electrical stimulation signal ranges from
2mA to 50mA, preferably from 4ma to 30mA.
10061]      Besides, the frequency of the first electrical stimulation signal is between
200KHz~1000KHz,          preferably    between     200KHz-250KHz,          250KHz-350KHz,
350KHz~450KHz,           450KHz-550KHz,           550KHz~650KHz,           650KHz~750KHz,
750KHz~-800KHz, or 800KHz~1000KHz.                  If the selected frequency is between
200KHz-450KHz, the device operates in relatively low frequency so it is less risky to
produce biological heat for better safety.        Otherwise, if the selected frequency is
between 550KHz~10O0KHz, the generated electric field has greater density so its
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                         14         Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

electrical stimulation has better performance.     In addition, by adjusting the duration
time Td, the amount of the electrical stimulation is adjusted and the time for
dissipating the produced biological heat accordingly.      For example, if the stimulation
intensity is relatively low, the duration time Td may be increased to continuously
stimulate.    If the stimulation intensity and the frequency are relatively high, the
duration time Td may be decreased to raise the time for dissipating heat.
10062]     When the electrical stimulation unit 12 receives the first electrical
stimulation signal, the first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122 of the
electrical stimulation unit 12 accordingly generate an electric field.         The distance
from the first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122 to the dorsal root ganglion 3
is arranged within the range of the second interval distance c, so the electric field
generated by the first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122 covers the dorsal
root ganglion 3.    In other words, the electric field covers the dorsal root ganglion 3
and its surroundings to electrically stimulate the target dorsal root ganglion 3 with low
intensity, low temperature and high frequency.       Without destroying the neural cells
of the dorsal root ganglion 3, the biomolecule generation by the dorsal root ganglion 3
is suppressed, and the threshold of the target zone of the dorsal root ganglion 3 is also
raised.   Thus, the neurotransmission capability of the dorsal root ganglion 3 in the
target zone is lowered and the neurotransmission is blocked.         As a result, the patient
feels nerve pain as little as possible.
[0063]     Furthermore, the patient may feel as little as possible pain on the target zone
without generating relative much sensations of paresthesia if applying the electrical
stimulation device for electrical stimulation.   The patient suffering pains over a long
period of time may accept this electrical stimulation treatment which is effective and
generates as little as possible sensations of paresthesia.        Preferably, the treatment
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                      15          Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

resulting from the electrical stimulation by the electrical stimulation device in the
embodiment       may   keep   effective  about    one week.          In   other  words,  the
neurotransmission is blocked about one week.        Thus, the patient may less frequently
receive the electrical stimulation treatment and it is not necessary for him to receive
the treatment frequently so he may be more possibly willing to receive the treatment.
Because the details can refer to the later experimental examples, they are not repeated
here.
[0064]      Furthennore, referring to FIG. 3A to FIG. 3D, the field pattern of the
electric field is adjusted by adjusting the electrode length a of the first electrode 121
and the second electrode 122, the first interval distance b between the first electrode
121 and the second electrode 122, or the second interval distance c between the first
electrode 121, the second electrode 122 and the dorsal root ganglion 3.         For example,
the voltage of the electrical stimulation signal is 5V, its frequency is 500 KHz, and the
distance C is 5mm.      Assuming that the electrode length a and the distance c of the
first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122 are constant (a=1mm, c=5mm), as
smaller the distance b (b=2mm) between the first electrode 121 and the second
electrode 122 as shown in the electric field simulation diagram in FIG. 3A, the
electric field (the strength of the electric field is 1OOV/m~100OV/m) may only or
mainly effectively cover the dorsal root ganglion 3 to be stimulated; as greater the
distance b (b=4mm) between the first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122 as
shown in FIG. 3B, the field pattern of the electric field is distributed expandingly and
completely cover the dorsal root ganglion 3 to be stimulated          (the drawn strength of
the electric field is 100V/m~IOOOV/m).          Relatively, the electric field strength is
more intensive if the position is closer to the electric field of the first electrode 121
and the second electrode 122.      As shown in FIG. 3C, it is a distribution diagram of
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                       16          Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

the field pattern that the field pattern of the electric field in FIG. 3A is applied with a
more intensive electric field so the strength of the electric field is distributed in the
range 100 V/m~5000V/m.         From the figure, as long as the electrode is disposed close
enough to the target zone which is to be stimulated (the distance c is between
0-10mm), the electric field has an effect on it and the electric field with higher
intensity is distributed more closer to the surface of the electrode.       Then, referring to
FIG. 3D and FIG. 3E, the difference between FIG. 3D and FIG. 3C is the electrode
length a of the first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122.             In FIG. 3D, the
electrode length a is changed to 2mm.         From FIG. 3D, it is seen that the electrode
becomes longer and the space distribution of the field pattern of the electric field also
becomes slightly larger.      The difference between FIG. 3E and FIG. 3D is that the
distance b between the electrodes is changed to 6mm on the condition that the
electrode length a of the first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122 are both
fixed (at 2mm).      As the distance b between the electrodes is increased, the space
distribution of the field pattern of the electric field also becomes larger.
100651     Then, different voltage influences on the space distribution of the field
pattern of the electric field are compared.        Referring to FIG. 4A to FIG. 4C, the
frequency 500KHz of the constant electrical stimulation signal is applied, and the
electrode length a of the first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122, the distance
b between the electrodes and the distance c to the target zone to be stimulated are all
fixed (a=2mm, b=2mm, c=5mm).                Different voltage influences on the space
distribution of the field pattern of the electric field are shown in the figures (the
voltage is 3V in FIG. 4A, the voltage is 5V in FIG. 4B, the voltage is IOV in FIG. 4C).
From the figures, it is seen that as the voltage is greater, the space distribution of the
field pattern of the electric field also becomes larger.
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                        17          Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

[0066]     Then, comparing FIG. 4B, FIG. 4D and FIG. 4E, the electrical stimulation
signal with 5V is applied, and the electrode length a of the first electrode 121 and the
second electrode 122, the distance b between the electrodes, and the distance c to the
target zone to be stimulated are all fixed (a=2mm, b=2mm, c=5mm).                  Different
frequency influences of the electrical stimulation signal on the space distribution of
the field pattern of the electric field are shown in the figures (the frequency of the
electrical stimulation signal is 200 KHz in FIG. 4D, the frequency of the electrical
stimulation signal is 500 KHz in FIG. 4B, the frequency of the electrical stimulation
signal is 800 KHz in FIG. 4E).      From FIG. 5B, because around the arc length at 4mm
it is the point closest to the electrical stimulation unit, the most intensive strength of
the electric field is here.   As the frequency is increased, the space distribution of the
field pattern of the electric field also becomes larger.     From FIG. 3A to FIG. 4E, in
the embodiment, the electric field strength ranges from 100 V/in to 5000 V/m,
preferably from 400 V/ni to 5000 V/m.
[0067]     Referring to FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B, the diameter of the target (circular dorsal
root ganglion 3) to be stimulated also shown in FIG. 2B is 5mm, the electrode length
a of the first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122 is about 1 mm, the distance c
is about 5mm and the input voltage is 5V.        The electric field strength on the target to
be stimulated for different arc length location of the electrode (in the horizontal axis,
the tangent at the left side of the circle is taken as the start point of the arc 0mm) is
shown in the figures.      In FIG. 5A, the corresponding strength of the electric field is
detected at different frequencies (200 KHz, 600 KHz and 1000 KHz) for electric
stimulation are compared.       In FIG. 5B, the corresponding strength of the electric
field is detected at different distances b between electrodes (b is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 mm.)
From FIG. 5A, as the frequency of the electric stimulation signal is increased, the
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                        18         Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

strength of the electric field is more intensive and the space distribution of the field
pattern of the electric field also becomes larger.       For example, under the condition
that the frequency of the electric stimulation signal is 1000 KHz, the maximum
strength of the electric field at the target zone may reach 400 V/m.                Under the
condition that the frequency of the electric stimulation signal is 200 KHz, the
maximum strength of the electric field at the target zone may be not intensive enough
to reach 300 V/m.        From FIG. 5B, if the distance b is between 4mm~6mm, the
electric field strength of the electromagnetic field reaches its maximum.
100681      After the electrical stimulation unit 12 is implanted in the organism, to
utilize it as fully as possible, the electrical stimulation device 1 of the embodiment is
able to operate in a low-frequency mode to assist the doctor in checking whether the
electrodes are at correct positions after the implantation.             For example, in the
low-frequency mode, the electrical stimulation unit 12 may, according to the control
of the first control unit 11, deliver a second electrical stimulation signal of which the
frequency is between 0.1 Hz-         KHz and its pulse width is between 10ts-500ps.
The electrical stimulation unit 12 delivers the second electrical stimulation signal to
detect the corresponding spasm of the muscle so as to check whether the implanted
electrical stimulation unit is loose or at wrong positions.
10069]      Referring to FIG. 2A and FIG. 6, in the embodiment, the electrical
stimulation unit 12 is like a straight line, but it is not limited thereto.      The shape of
the electrical stimulation unit 12 may be like the shape described in the following
embodiments, but it is not limited thereto.
10070]      In the embodiment, the electrical stimulation device I is an active electrical
stimulation device of which the first control unit 11 together with the electrical
stimulation unit 12 are implanted in the target zone of the organism.          In other words,
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                         19         Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

both the first control unit 11 and the electrical stimulation unit 12 are implanted in the
organism subcutaneously.        Alternatively, the first control unit 11 and the electrical
stimulation     unit  12 are    integrated   into one part first and then          implanted
subcutaneously.      Because of electrically coupled to the controller 2 outside the
organism, the first control unit 11 can receive the parameter signal and energy from
the second control unit 21 so the electrical stimulation unit 12 may electrically
stimulate the target zone of the organism.
10071]      The electrical stimulation device of the disclosure is not limited to the
electrical stimulation device I mentioned above.          In other embodiment, the active
electrical stimulation device may be like the electrical stimulation device in FIG. 7.
The electrical stimulation device 1a in the embodiment and the electrical stimulation
device 1 in the previous embodiment have substantially alike elements thereof, and
the first control unit 11 a and the electrical stimulation unit 12a are also respectively
implanted in the epidermis S of the organism (subcutaneous).                 However in the
embodiment, the first control unit 11 a of the electrical stimulation device 1a is a
FPCB (flexible printed circuit board) integrated in the electrical stimulation unit, and
it still can receive the parameter signal and electrical energy from the second control
unit (not shown in the figure) outside the organism, and deliver the electrical
stimulation signal to the electrical stimulation unit 12a to electrically stimulate the
dorsal root ganglion 3 of the organism.       In the embodiment, the electrical stimulation
device la may be narrowed enough to be implanted subcutaneously for abating the
burden of the organism (or the patient).
10072]      Alternatively, the electrical stimulation device may be like the device shown
in FIG. 8.     Referring to FIG. 8, in the embodiment, the electrical stimulation device
lb is a passive electrical stimulation device.       However, the first control unit 11 b of
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                         20         Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

the electrical stimulation device lb is integrated in the controller 2 outside the
epidermis S of the organism (subcutaneous).             Thus, the implanted electrical
stimulation device lb does not contain the control unit therein.              The electrical
stimulation unit 1 lb (lead) at its end has a FPCB which is implanted subcutaneously
and not deeply (for example the depth is less than 5cm).         The controller 2b which is
not implanted within the skin can deliver an electrical stimulation signal to the
electrical stimulation unit 11 b, so the electrical stimulation unit 12b can electrically
stimulate the dorsal root ganglion 3 of the organism.
100731     As to implementation of the electrical stimulation unit, it is not limited to
the above electrical stimulation unit 12.          FIGS. 9, 12,       13 illustrate another
embodiment.      In the embodiment, the electrical stimulation unit 12c is like a ring,
and the electrical stimulation unit 12c includes at least two first electrodes 121 and at
least two second electrodes 122.      The first electrodes 121 and the second electrode
122 are interlaced at intervals (as shown in FIG. 12). Alternatively, the first electrodes
121    and the second      electrodes   122   may    be arranged      sequentially  without
interlacement (as shown in FIG. 13).          The electric field generated by the first
electrode 121 and the second electrode 122 of the electrical stimulation unit 12
surrounds and covers the target dorsal root ganglion 3 (as shown in FIG. 14) to
stimulate it with low intensity, low temperature and high-frequency electromagnetism.
Furthermore,   if the position is closer to the first electrode 121 and the second
electrode 122, the electric field is more intensive.
10074]     Referring to FIG. 10, the electrical stimulation unit 12d may be like a helix,
and the electrical stimulation unit 12d includes at least two first electrodes 121 and at
least two second electrodes 122.      In the embodiment, the electrical stimulation unit
12d includes two first electrodes 121 and two second electrodes 122 for example.
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                       21         Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

The arrangement of the first electrode 121 and the second electrode 122 is not limited.
The first electrodes 121 and the second electrodes 122 may be interlaced or arranged
without interlacement, and the first electrodes 121 and the second electrodes 122 may
be arranged like a helix to surround the dorsal root ganglion 3.          Because the electric
field generated by the first electrodes 121 and the second electrodes 122 like a helix
surround and cover the target dorsal root ganglion 3, the target dorsal root ganglion 3
is electrically stimulated with low intensity, low temperature and high frequency.
[0075]      Referring to FIG. 11, in the embodiment, the electrical stimulation unit 12e
is like an arc, and the electrical stimulation unit 12e includes at least two first
electrodes 121 and at least two second electrodes 122.              In the embodiment, the
electrical stimulation unit 12e includes two first electrodes 121 and two second
electrodes 122 for example.        The arrangement of the first electrodes 121 and the
second electrodes 122 is not limited.           The first electrodes 121 and the second
electrodes 122 may be interlaced or arranged without interlacement, and the first
electrodes 121 and the second electrodes 122 may be arranged to surround the dorsal
root ganglion 3.     Because the electric field generated by the first electrode 121 and
the second electrode 122 surround and cover the dorsal root ganglion 3, the target
dorsal root ganglion 3 is stimulated with low intensity, low temperature and high
frequency.
10076]      Referring to FIG. 15, in the embodiment, the electrical stimulation unit 12f
is like a flake (or a flat), and the electrical stimulation unit 12f includes a plurality of
the first electrodes 121 and a plurality of the second electrodes 122.            These first
electrodes 121 and these second electrodes 122 are arranged at intervals in an array.
Similarly, the electric field generated by the first electrode 121 and the second
electrode 122 surrounds and covers the dorsal root ganglion 3 so as to electrically
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                         22         Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

stimulate the target, the dorsal root ganglion 3, with low intensity and low
temperature.
[0077]     In addition to being applied for pain-management or pain-reducing as
described above, the present invention also provides several embodiments, such as the
electrical stimulation device, method, and computer-readable medium, which are
applied for reducing renal hypertension.
10078]     Please refer to FIG. 16, which is a flow chart showing the application of
method for reducing renal hypertension according to another embodiment of the
present invention.
10079]     In the present embodiment, the method for reducing renal hypertension is
applied to electrically stimulate a target zone of an organism by the electrical
stimulation device described above. As described above, the electrical stimulation
device I includes at least an electrical stimulation unit 11 and the electrical
stimulation unit 11 includes at least a first electrode 111 and a second electrode 112.
The method comprises the following steps: placing the electrical stimulation unit 11
near the target zone (Step SO1); and delivering a first electrical stimulation signal by
the electrical stimulation unit 11 to electrically stimulate the target zone (Step S02).
Accordingly, an electric field covering the target zone is generated between the first
electrode 111 and the second electrode 112 according to the first electrical stimulation
signal, and the strength of the electric field ranges from 100 V/m to 1000 V/m.
100801     In other words, the process utilizing the electrical stimulation device for
electrically stimulating a target zone of an organism to reducing renal hypertension
symptoms of such organism can also be described as followed.
10081]     A renal hypertension management method of an electrical stimulation
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                        23         Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

device comprising the following steps. First, positioning the electrical stimulation
device 1, which is at least at a distance c away from a nerve of a target zone. The
distance c is a minimum linear distance between the electrical stimulation device 1
and the targeted nerve, and the distance c is no more than 10 mm. Second, applying a
preset voltage to the first and second electrodes (i.e., the positive and negative
electrodes) so that an electric field covering and stimulating the nerve is produced
between the positive and negative electrodes.
100821     In addition, suitable parameters of the preset voltage (such as the voltage
ranges, frequency ranges, PRF ranges, and pulse width) and the suitable strength of
the electric field is substantially the same as those of first electrical stimulation signal
and the electric field generated accordingly as described above, and they are not
repeated here.
10083]     The method according to the present embodiment can effectively reduce the
symptoms of renal hypertension and also can reduce such symptoms for a long time.
Unlike the treatment of medicines, the symptoms of high blood pressure can be
reduced after electrically stimulated for only 90 seconds according to the method of
the present embodiment. The organism can receive the electrical stimulation for a
second time until at least 2 hours to 12 days after the first time of the electrical
stimulation for maintaining the effect of ameliorating renal hypertension. The time
interval between the two electrical stimulations can be as long as 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,
16, 18, 20, or 22 hours, or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14 days, and the
symptoms of high blood pressure are still ameliorated. Therefore, the organism may
not have to receive the electrical stimulation once or even several times a day to
reduce renal hypertension. The details are described in the following experiments and
are omitted here.

100851     Moreover, the present disclosure also provides another embodiment, which
is described as followed. In a neurostimulation method, the improvement of such
method consists of, or comprises, using the electrical stimulation device I which is
configured to deliver a first electrical stimulation signal to a target zone (which can be
a nerve) of an organism to electrically stimulate the target zone to treat renal
hypertension of an organism. According to the first electrical stimulation signal, an
electric field covering the target zone is generated between the first electrode 111 and
the second electrode 112 of the electrical stimulation device 1. The strength of the
electric field ranges from 100 V/m to 1000 V/m.

present invention is also provided. FIG. 17A is a functional block diagram showing
the computer-readable medium according to another embodiment, and FIG. 17B is a

100881     The electrical stimulation device 5 also includes a first control unit 51 and
an electrical stimulation unit 52. The electrical stimulation unit 52 electrically couples
to the first control unit 51. The electrical stimulation device 5 is similar to the

substantially the same as those of the electrical stimulation device 1. On the other
hand, first control unit 51 further electrically couples to a computer-readable medium,
which is exemplified as the memory unit 53 in the present embodiment. The memory
unit 53 is a non-transitory storage medium, and can be a memory, a memory card, an
optical disc drive, a video tape drive, a magnetic tape drive, and/or the combination
thereof. The memory can be a ROM, Flash Memory, or Field-Programmable Gate
Array (FPGA), or other non-transitory memory.
10089]     One or more instructions 531 are stored in the memory unit 53. For the
clarity of the figures, two instructions 531 are stored in the memory unit 53 as shown
in FIG. 17A, but the present invention is not limited thereto. The first control unit 51
can assess the instructions 531 from the memory unit 53, and execute the instructions
531 to control the action of the electrical stimulation device 5. The electrical
stimulation device 5 can be applied to electrically stimulate a target zone of an
organism for ameliorating the renal-hypertension symptoms of the organism. The
electrical stimulation unit 52 also comprises a first electrode and second electrode.
100901     The instructions 531 are executed by the first control unit 51 to cause the
electrical stimulation device 5 to execute an electrical stimulation process for reducing
renal hypertension, which comprises the following steps: delivering a first electrical
stimulation signal by the electrical stimulation unit 52 to electrically stimulate the
target zone (Step S 11). During the process of the electrical stimulation, an electric
field covering the target zone is generated between the first electrode and the second
electrode according to the first electrical stimulation signal, and a strength of the

electric field ranges from 100 V/m to 1000 V/m. In the embodiment, the range of the
electric field is measured or estimated by a simulation manner. For example, the range
of the electric field induced according to the electrical stimulation signal of the
electrical stimulation device can be estimated or simulated by performing finite
element analysis using the AC/DC module of Comsol Multiphysics           @  (a simulation
software, COMSOL, Burlington MA, USA). For the simulation, geometry, dielectric
characterizations (such as Conductivity (S/m) - Permittivity) of media (such as nerves,
muscles, skins, and materials of the electrodes), and electrical stimulation parameters
(such as a voltage, a frequency or a pulse width) are input to the AC/DC module,
wherein the geometry is built by such as the number of electrodes, the shapes and
dimensions of the electrodes, the distance between the electrodes, and the distance
between the electrodes and the target zone.
[00911     As described above, the present embodiment is exemplified with the
electrical stimulation device 5 which is controlled by the first control unit 51 to
execute the instructions 531 stored in the memory unit 53 electrically coupled to the
first control unit 51. In other words, the electrical stimulation device 5 can
independently execute every steps of the electrical stimulation process for reducing
renal hypertension without any external controller.
[00921     In other practicing modes, the computer-readable medium of the present
embodiment can be electrically coupled to an external controller (e.g., the controller 2)
or a control unit or a CPU of the external controller (e.g., the control unit 21 of the
controller 2), to make the electrical stimulation device 5 to execute the steps of the
electrical stimulation process for reducing renal hypertension. In such practicing mode,
the instructions 531 are assessed by the control unit of the external controller to
control the electrical stimulation device 5 to deliver the first electrical stimulation

signal. In other words, the electrical stimulation device 5 and the external controller
can be seen as a system, which can execute the instructions stored in the
computer-readable medium and the steps of the electrical stimulation process for
reducing renal hypertension.
100931     Other technical features of the computer-readable medium of the present
embodiment can be referred to relevant description of the electrical stimulation device
and the controller as described in the above-mentioned embodiments, and they are not
repeated here.
100941     From the below experiments, the operation and effect of the electrical
stimulation device which stimulates the dorsal root ganglion and for applied for
reducing renal-hypertension symptoms are explained.         However, the below examples
are just explanatory but not limited to the scope of the invention.
[00951     Experimental example 1: the pain behavior test on the foot in the rat
Von Frey (VF) test
10096]     Sprague-Dawley rats (SD rats) of about 275-350 grams weight are used
(BioLASCO, Taiwan co., Ltd., Taiwan) and they are provided from the central
laboratory animal center of Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital.                The spinal
nerve ligation (SNL) is performed on the L5 spinal nerve of the SD rat.           After the
development of the pain behavior is stable for few days and conforms to the clinical
pain development model, the electronic stimulation unit 1 is implanted and then the
electrical stimulation therapy is performed.     In this experimental example, the rats
are divided into the control group and the experimental group according to the
different electrical stimulation treatments.   As to the experimental group, the pain
behavior is continuously observed for 7 days after surgery.        After the pain behavior
is stable, the electrical stimulation therapy is performed for 5 minutes once a week
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                      28          Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

totally three times (FIG. 18A), or biweekly totally two times (FIG. 18B, and the
responses to the pain behavior tests are observed.     The results are shown in FIGS.
18A and 18B.
10097]     As shown in FIG. 18A, the pain behavior of the control group (N=3)
becomes stable on the third day until the 29th day, and Von Frey pain pressure
thresholds are all less than 5 g (between 1.720.39 g and 4.851.31 g).         As to the
experimental group (N=7), its pain behavior is similar to that of the control group
before receiving electrical stimulation therapy (on the 7th day, D7) and becomes
stable on about the third day similarly.      However, after receiving the first (D7)
electrical stimulation, its Von Frey pain pressure thresholds are improved.      They are
different from the control group (D8: 4.731.47 g; DIO: 4.851.31 g) both on D8
(9.851.56 g) and D1O (9.01.68 g), the tolerance levels of the pressure thresholds in
the experimental group are improved up to about 10 g, the pain pressure thresholds
increase to about 2.08 times as compared with the control group, and the pain relief
will gradually decay until receiving the second electrical stimulation therapy (the
experimental group D14: 4.53 1.08 g; the control group D14: 2.981.44 g).         On the
next day after receiving the second (D14) electrical stimulation therapy (the
experimental group D15: 8.121.65 g; the control group D15: 1.810.53 g; the pain
pressure threshold of the experimental group is about 4.49 times greater than that of
the control group), the therapy of receiving the first electrical stimulation is still
effective.   The response to the pain behavior test is still excellent on the next day
after receiving the third (D21) electrical stimulation therapy (the experimental group
D22: 9.171.93 g; the control group D22: 2.730.57 g; the pain pressure threshold of
the experimental group is about 3.36 times greater than that of the control group).
Obviously, the pain can be immediately relieved, and there are differences of the pain
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                     29         Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

pressure thresholds between the experimental group and the control group every time
after receiving the electrical stimulation therapy.    It approves that after the electrical
stimulation unit of the invention is implanted, receiving the electrical stimulation
therapy for 5 minutes once a week can relieve the pain for a short time.
100981     In FIG. 18B, pain behaviors          of the control group (N=4)            and the
experimental group (N=7) are shown as percent of paw withdrawal threshold of
prespinal nerve ligation baseline (Pre-SNL) at different time points. Similarly, both of
the experimental group and the control group, pain behaviors become stable on about
the third day before receiving the first electrical stimulation treatment. The pain
behavior of the control group remain stable on the third day until the 35th day.
However, after receiving the first electrical stimulation, its paw withdrawal thresholds
are significantly improved (D8: about       5 8 %)  and gradually decayed, but remain
effective, on DI    to D14 (DI: about 35%; D12: about 20%; D14: about 18%) when
compared with the control group. The paw withdrawal thresholds of the experimental
group returned to pre-stimulation level at 14 days (D21) after the first electrical
stimulation. After receiving the second electrical stimulation therapy, the paw
withdrawal thresholds of the experimental group are again significantly improved
(D22: about 48%) and gradually decayed but remain effective on D24 to D28 (D24:
about 25%; D26: about 20%; D28: about 8%).
10099]     In addition, as shown in FIG. 22 of the results demonstrated by Ronen
Shechter    et  al.  (Ronen Shechter      et al. (2013,      August),     Conventional    and
Kilohertz-frequency      Spinal    Cord     Stimulation       Produces       Intensity-   and
Frequency-dependent Inhibition of Mechanical Hypersensitivity in a Rat Model of
Neuropathic Pain, ANESTHESIOLOGY, 119(2), 422-32), which also uses the same
animal model (SD rats receiving SNL to mimic neuropathic pain) as the present
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                      30           Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

experimental example, the effect of the electrical stimulation (i.e., the paw withdrawal
threshold, also represented as percent of pre-SNL baseline) of 50 Hz, 1kHz, and
10kHz of Ronen Shechter et al. started to drop at 30 minutes after the first time of
electrical stimulation, and on the next day of the first electrical stimulation, the effect
of the electrical stimulation of 50 Hz, 1kHz, and 10kHz of Ronen Shechter et al.
further dropped and almost became the same the level of sham group. Moreover, even
after receiving electrical stimulations on three consecutive days (once per day), the
paw withdrawal threshold of Ronen Shechter et al. still returned to pre-stimulation
level at 5 days after the third electrical stimulation. However, according to the results
as shown in FIG 18B, with only one shot of the electrical stimulation of the present
embodiment, the effect of pain relief did not reduced until 24 hours after the electrical
stimulation. In other words, the effect of the electrical stimulation provided by the
present embodiment can last at least for 24 hours, and even for 7 days, or even up to
14 days, after receiving the electrical stimulation. Obviously, the pain can be
effectively relived by the PRF electrical stimulation of the present embodiment with a
prolonged effect.
10100]     Experimental example 2: neuroelectrophysiological test
10101]     SD rats are divided into the experimental group and the control group, the
experimental group (FIG. 19B) receives the electrical stimulation for 5 minutes, and
the control group (FIG. 19A) does not receive any electrical stimulation.          The two
groups receive large current stimulation (2.5T, C response threshold) on the sciatic
nerve under the same conditions so as to induce obvious A responses (referring to
A-fiber) and C responses (referring to C-fiber) occurring in the ipsilateral spinal
dorsal horn.    Before the interventional measure (electrical stimulation for 5 minutes
or suspending recording for 5 minutes), the baseline is measured for 30 minutes (18
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                        31        Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

samples, 100 seconds interval) in advance.           After the interventional measure is
provided, the large current stimulation is performed on the sciatic nerve once every 30
minutes, the data are continuously recorded for 2 hours, and 5 experimental
waveforms are respectively generated in two groups.              The results of the control
group and the experimental group are respectively shown in FIG. 19A and FIG. 19B.
[01021     In this experiment, as to the rats receiving the electrical stimulation for 5
minutes, the mean values of the neural responses for every 30 minutes are aligned at
the point of 90ms first, and then the individual time of each group are compared.
Referring to FIG. 19A and FIG. 19B, the mean lines of interval of every 30 minutes
are put together for comparison.      Here, there are no significant differences between
the curves of individual time in the control group shown in FIG. 19A.             Compared
with the control group, it can be seen from FIG. 19B that the C-component is
relatively largely reduced after the electrical stimulation in comparison with the
baseline in the experimental group.
[01031     In detail, the large current stimulation on the peripheral sciatic nerve acts as
the source of pain in this experimental example, and the signal can be transmitted to
the dorsal root ganglion and the spinal dorsal root nerves through large diameter
nerves (i.e. A-fibers) and small diameter nerves, including myelinated nerve fibers (i.e.
A 6 -fibers) and unmyelinated nerve fibers (i.e. C-fibers).      The neural response to the
interventional    measure      of   electrical    stimulation     can    be   observed   by
electrophysiological measurement of nerve conduction.          From FIG. 19B, the induced
C response is relatively largely reduced with time after receiving the electrical
stimulation, and the area of the C-component (intensity) is also reduced with time.       It
shows that the axon of the C-fiber which is responsible for sense of pain (especially
the pain which is chronic and difficult to locate) is changed in transmission.         The
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                         32        Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

electrical stimulation blocks or inhibits the signal transmission of neuron in small
diameter fibers or nerves whose transmission velocity is small or equal to 75 mi/s, so
the pain can be relieved, even totally blocked.
101041     Experimental     example     3:   test for   reducing      renal   hypertension
symptoms
101051     The   electrical  stimulation   device provided       by the above-mentioned
embodiments of the present invention can be used to reduce pain and also can be used
to reduce renal-hypertension symptoms of an organism. The stimulation target zone is
a dorsal root ganglion, a spinal cord, a dorsal root, a dorsal horn, a ventral root, or a
nerve on a neurotransmission pathway causing the renal hypertension. In this case, the
nerves can be the sympathetic nerves, parasympathetic nerves, vagus nerves and/or
intravascular nerves near or in the renal artery or around the kidney. Please referring
to FIGS. 20A and 20B. FIG. 20A is a schematic diagram showing nerves in the
peripheral of the kidney of the rat and the electrical stimulation model in the test of
reducing renal hypertension according to the present Experimental example. FIG. 20B
is a schematic diagram showing the measuring system according to the present
Experimental example. In the present Experimental example, rats R receive the first
electrical stimulation signal delivered by the electrical stimulation unit of the
electrical stimulation device provided by the above-mentioned embodiments of the
present invention, to demonstrate the efficacy of the electrical stimulation device
applied for reducing renal hypertension.
10106]     In FIG. 20A, the kidney R and the renal artery RI of the SD rat R are
depicted. At the left side of the kidney R, the renal artery RI is depicted to connect to
the aorta, and the renal vein is depicted to connect to the vena cava. Unilateral ligation
of renal artery is performed on the left renal artery of the SD rat to induce renal

hypertension, so as to mimic the organism who suffers from renal hypertension.
10107]     In the present Experimental example, SD rats of about 275-350 grams
weight are used (BioLASCO, Taiwan co., Ltd., Taiwan) and they are provided from
the central laboratory animal center of Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital. The
SD rats are divided into the experimental group and the control group (sham group).
According to the process provided by MING - HUNG TSAI et al. (MING - HUNG
TSAI et al. (2003, November), Mesenteric Vasoconstriction Triggers Nitric Oxide
Overproduction in the Superior Mesenteric Artery of Portal Hypertensive Rats,
GASTROENTEROLOGY,               Vol.125,   No.5,   1452-1461),    the    SD   rats of the
experimental group and the control group were anesthetized and followed by
unilateral ligation of the left renal artery of the SD rat to induce renal hypertension.
The electrical stimulation unit was implanted in each SD rat. The electrical
stimulation unit comprises two bipolar stainless-steel cuff electrodes 521 and 522.
The two cuff electrodes 521 and 522 are implanted adjacent to the renal artery RI of
the SD rat R and operators are careful not to pull the two electrodes. In the present
Experimental example, the target zone is the renal sympathetic nerve on the
endothelium of the renal artery RI. The SD rats of the experimental group received
the electrical stimulation for 5 minutes to block the neurotransmission of the renal
nerves of the SD rats R. The frequency of the first electrical stimulation signal is 500
KHz. The duration time Td of the pulses in single pulse period is 25 milliseconds. The
preset voltage applied across the first electrode and the second electrode is 5V, and
pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) is 2Hz. The SD rats of the control group did not
receive any electrical stimulation. After electrical stimulations,           the electrical
stimulation unit and the two cuff electrodes 521 and 522 are removed from the SD
rats and the wounds of SD rats caused by the surgery are stitched.

[0108]     As shown in FIG. 20B, the blood pressure of SD rats are measured by the
measuring system 4. The measuring system comprises a pressure sensor and an
inflatable device. The SD rat R is placed in the acrylic barrel 42, and the tail 411 of
the SD rat R is exposed from the acrylic barrel 42. Systolic and diastolic pressures of
the SD rat R are measured by the CODA Surgical Monitor through the tail-cuff
method at the following three different stages. For the first stage, the systolic and
diastolic pressures of the SD rat R are measured before receiving unilateral ligation of
left renal artery and are recorded to be the blood pressure of the SD rat R in the
normal situation. For the second stage, the blood pressure of the SD rat R is measured
and recorded after receiving unilateral ligation of left renal artery. For the third stage,
the blood pressure of the SD rat R is measured and recorded after receiving the
electrical stimulation.
10109]     The measuring results of the blood pressures (mmHg) of the SD rats are
shown in FIG. 20C. Each data of blood pressure of the SD rat was obtained by
average of triple duplex. In FIG. 20C, "BL" indicates the date starting experiment and
the blood pressures measured at this date were deemed as the baseline. "BDx"
indicates "x" days after the date of "BL"; "RASOP" means operation of renal artery
stenosis (i.e., the unilateral ligation of the left renal artery as described above);
"RASDx" indicates "x" days after RAS operation; "PRF" means the electrical
stimulation therapy as described above; "PRFDx" indicates "x" days after receiving
the PRF electrical stimulation of the present embodiment.
10110]     In FIG. 20C, within 14 days after unilateral ligation of the left renal artery,
both systolic and diastolic pressures of the SD rats at the second stage were sustained
at a high stage and significantly higher than their counterparts at the first stage (i.e.,
blood pressures measured before ligation).
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                      35         Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

[0111]     SD rats were then stimulated by the PRF electrical stimulation signal as
described above. At the first day after the PRF electrical stimulation (PRFD1), the
systolic pressures of the SD rats dropped to 108mmHg and the diastolic pressures
dropped to 85mmHg. Such result demonstrates that the PRF electrical stimulation of
the present embodiment can effectively ameliorate the induced symptoms of renal
hypertension. The blood pressures of the SD rats then gradually picked up. Until
twelve days after the PRF electrical stimulation (PRFD12), the systolic pressures of
the SD rats were restored to 128mmHg, which was close to the blood pressures of the
SD rats at the first stage (i.e., the normal situation) and still lower than their
counterparts at the second stage of induced renal hypertension. Such results
demonstrates that the PRIF electrical stimulation of the present embodiment may exert
a long-term effect, and the efficacy of the PRF electrical stimulation of the present
embodiment can last at least for 12 days. Thus, the first electrical stimulation signal
can be delivered for a second time at least 2 hours to 12 days after delivering the first
electrical stimulation signal for a first time.
101121     Experimental example 4: long-term effect of PRF electrical stimulation
on pain behaviors in SD rats
10113]     SD rats were divided into 3 groups: the normal (didn't received SNL) with
sham PRF group (C+Sham), the SNL (received SNL on L5) with sham PRF group
(SNL+Sham), and the SNL with PRF group (SNL+PRF). The spinal nerve ligation
(SNL) is performed on the L5 spinal nerves of the SD rats of the SNL+Sham group
and the SNL+PRF group. Only SD rats in the SNL+PRF group are received PRF
stimulations, which are performed as following: the stimulation electrode was inserted
into the left L5 foraminal canal, whereas the reference electrode was placed in contact
with the surrounding non-neural tissues. The electrodes were connected to a PXI-5402
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                        36       Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

Function Generator (National Instruments, Austin, TX) to generate RF pulses with the
following parameter settings based on clinical settings: 2-Hz biphasic trains with
500-kHz RF waves, 25-ms train width, and oscillating amplitudes at an intensity of
2.5 V. The PRF duration was 300 seconds. SD rats of the SNL+Sham group are
received an electrode placement without electricity as a sham stimulation. The PRF
stimulation or sham PRF stimulation was performed 8 days after the spinal nerve
ligation (SNL+PRF, or SNL+Sham, respectively).
101141     The mechanical threshold was evaluated using von Frey filaments (Stoelting,
Wood Dale, IL) as described in the Experimental example 1. The tests were
conducted daily from at least 2 days before SNL for establishing preoperative
baselines, and scheduled days after SNL as well as after PRF/sham treatment.
10115]     The thermal threshold was measured by paw withdrawal latencies to radiant
heat stimulation in the plantar test device (Plantar Test Apparatus, IITC, CA). The
cut-off latency was 30 seconds to avoid thermal injury. The withdrawal latency at
each time point was an average of three latencies separated by a 5-min interval. The
tests were conducted on the same days as the von Frey test and both tests were
conducted by the same operator who was blinded to the group allocation.
10116]     The effect of the PRF stimulation on SNL-induced mechanical allodynia
and heat hyperalgesia are shown in FIGS. 21A and 21B, respectively. The arrows
indicate spinal nerve ligation and PRF stimulation. "BL" means pre-SNL baseline,
"Dn" means post-SNL day, and "PDn" means (PRF/sham) posttreatment day. * P

21A and 21B; P = .000 for most post-SNL data vs baseline data; and P < .001 for
SNL+Sham vs C+Sham, which are not shown). When compared with the results of
SNL+Sham       group, the    PRF stimulations      significantly suppressed      mechanical
allodynia (i.e., tactile allodynia) for 10 days (P < .005 at PDIO; FIG. 21A) of
SNL+PRF group, and also reduced thermal hyperalgesia for 2 weeks (P < .01 at PD14;
FIG. 21B) of SNL+PRF group. It demonstrates that the PRF stimulations of the
present embodiment exert effects on the late-stage pain. Collectively, FIGS. 21A and
21B illustrates that the PRF electrical stimulations produced prolonged analgesic
effect on SNL-induced pain at least for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14
days.
10118]     Moreover, according to at least the results of the Experimental example 2
(FIGS. 19A and 19B), the C-response continuously reduced in the first two hours after
the PRF electrical stimulation and became stable afterwards. Such result represents
that the PRF electrical stimulation can exert effect of pain relief at least for two hours.
In combination of the results of the Experimental example 1, 2 and 4 (FIGS. 18A,
18B, 19A, 19B, 21A and 21B), the effect of pain relief exerted by the PRF electrical
stimulations of the present embodiments can last for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20,
or 22 hours, or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14 days after receiving PRF
electrical stimulations. At 14 days after receiving PRF electrical stimulations, the paw
withdrawal thresholds of the experimental group returned to about the same level as
the control or sham group. Such results also represent that the effects exerted by the
PRF electrical stimulations of the present embodiments are recoverable and do not
lead to permanent damage of the targeted nerves.
[01191     Therefore, when applied to reduce renal hypertension, the electrical
stimulation device of the present embodiment can effectively and quickly ameliorate
9318-A54204AUf/Yvonne/                       38          Client's No.:2013-002AU-CIP5

the symptoms of renal hypertension of the organism. It is also noted that the electrical
stimulation of the present embodiment is not conducted intravenously (i.e., electrodes
were not directed inserted into and stimulated inside the targeted artery or vein). The
electrical stimulation of the present embodiment is not to ablate the targeted nerve
(which is destructive to the targeted nerve) as the conventional radiofrequency
ablation (RFA) and therefore will cause recurrence of high blood pressure resulted
from the regeneration of the targeted nerve. In contrast to the medication therapy, a
5-minute of the PRF electrical stimulation provided by the present embodiment is
sufficient to effectively ameliorate the symptoms of renal hypertension of organisms.
In other words, the electrical stimulation of the present embodiment may effectively
and continuously reduce renal hypertension of an organism with an interval of at least
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, or 22 hours, or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
or 14 days. Other technical features of the method for reducing renal hypertension
utilizing the electrical stimulation device of the embodiments of the present invention
are substantially the same as those describe above, and they are not repeated here.
101201      In summary, in the method for reducing renal hypertension and the
non-transitory computer-readable medium according to the disclosure, a first electrical
stimulation signal is delivered by the electrical stimulation unit of the electrical
stimulation device so as to generate an electric field between the first electrode and
the second electrode. The electric field covers a target zone of an organism who
suffers from renal hypertension. Such method and non-transitory computer-readable
medium can effectively ameliorate symptoms of renal hypertension with long term
effects, without the side effects caused by drugs, and also reduce the possibility of
infection caused by operation.
