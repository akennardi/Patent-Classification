10 Background of the Invention
   Field of the Invention
           The invention relates to variants of albumin or fragments thereof or fusion
   polypeptides comprising variant albumin or fragments thereof having a change in
   binding affinity to FcRn and/or a change in half-life compared to the albumin, fragment
15 thereof or fusion polypeptide comprising albumin or a fragment thereof. The invention
   allows tailoring of binding affinity and/or half-life of an albumin to the requirements and
   desires of a user or application.
   Description of the Related Art
20         Albumin is a protein naturally found in the blood plasma of mammals where it is
   the most abundant protein.      It has important roles in maintaining the desired osmotic
   pressure of the blood and also in transport of various substances in the blood stream.
   Albumins have been characterized from many species including human, pig, mouse,
   rat, rabbit and goat and they share a high degree of sequence and structural homology.
25         Albumin binds in vivo to its receptor, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) "Brambell"
   and this interaction is known to be important for the plasma half-life of albumin. FcRn is
   a membrane bound protein, expressed in many cell and tissue types. FcRn has been
   found to salvage albumin from intracellular degradation (Roopenian D. C. and Akilesh,
   S. (2007), Nat. Rev. Immunol 7, 715-725.).            FcRn is a bifunctional molecule that
30 contributes to maintaining a high level of IgGs and albumin in serum in mammals such
   as human beings.
           Whilst the FcRn-immunoglobulin (IgG) interaction has been characterized in the
   prior art, the FcRn-albumin interaction is less well characterized. The major FcRn
   binding site is localized within Dill (381-585), (Andersen et al (2010), Clinical
35 Biochemistry 43,367-372).       A number of key amino acids have been shown to be
   important in binding, notably histidines H464, H510 and H536 and Lys500 (Andersen et

                                              - 1a
  al (2010), Nat. Commun. 3:610. DOI:10.1038/ncommsl607). The crystal structure of a
  human serum albumin (HSA) variant (V418M+T420A+E505G+V547A) with strong
  affinity to FcRn at acidic pH and in addition with increased binding at neutral pH has
  been reported allowing more detailed understanding of the interacting interfaces. In
5 addition, the authors were able to alter the affinity to FcRn through amino acid
  substitution and show that this could translate into increased circulatory half-lives in
  mice and monkey, most notably for HSA E505G+V547A (Schmidt et al (2012), Cell
  Structure. 21, Issue 11, (doi:10.1016/j.str.2013.08.022)).

             Data indicates that IgG and albumin bind non-cooperatively to distinct sites on FcRn
   (Andersen et al. (2006), Eur. J. Immunol 36, 3044-3051; Chaudhury et al. (2006), Biochemistry
   45, 4983-4990).
             It is known that mouse FcRn binds IgG from mice and humans whereas human FcRn
 5 appears to be more discriminating (Ober et al. (2001) Int. Immunol 13, 1551-1559). Andersen et
   al. (2010) Journal of Biological Chemistry 285(7):4826-36, describes the affinity of human and
   mouse FcRn for each mouse and human albumin (all possible combinations). No binding of
   albumin from either species was observed at physiological pH to either receptor. At acidic pH, a
    100-fold difference in binding affinity was observed. In all cases, binding of albumin and IgG
 0 from either species to both receptors were additive.
             Human serum albumin (HSA) has been well characterized as a polypeptide of 585
   amino acids, the sequence of which can be found in Peters, T., Jr. (1996) Al/ about Albumin:
   Biochemistry, Genetics and Medical, Applications pp10, Academic Press, Inc., Orlando (ISBN 0
    12-552110-3). It has a characteristic binding to its receptor FcRn, where it binds at pH 6.0 but
 5 not at pH 7.4.
            The plasma half-life of HSA has been found to be approximately 19 days. A natural
   variant having lower plasma half-life has been identified (Peach, R. J. and Brennan, S. 0.,
   (1991) Biochim Biophys Acta.1097:49-54) having the substitution D494N. This substitution
   generated an N-glycosylation site in this variant, which is not present in the wild-type albumin. It
 0 is not known whether the glycosylation or the amino acid change is responsible for the change
   in plasma half- life.
            Albumin has a long plasma half-life and because of this property it has been suggested
   for use in drug delivery. Albumin has been conjugated to pharmaceutically beneficial
   compounds (W02000/69902), and it was found that the conjugate maintained the long plasma
e5 half-life of albumin. The resulting plasma half-life of the conjugate was generally considerably
   longer than the plasma half-life of the beneficial therapeutic compound alone.
             Further, albumin has been genetically fused to therapeutically beneficial peptides (WO
   2001/79271 A and W02003/59934) with the typical result that the fusion has the activity of the
   therapeutically beneficial peptide and a considerably longer plasma half-life than the plasma
30 half-life of the therapeutically beneficial peptides alone.
            Otagiri et al (2009), Biol. Pharm. Bull. 32(4), 527-534, discloses more than 70 albumin
   variants, of these 25 of these are found to be mutated in domain Ill. A natural variant lacking the
   last 175 amino acids at the carboxy termini has been shown to have reduced half-life (Andersen
   et al (2010), Clinical Biochemistry 43, 367-372). Iwao et al (2007) studied the half-life of
35 naturally occurring human albumin variants using a mouse model, and found that K541 E and
    K560E had reduced half-life, E501 K and E570K had increased half-life and K573E had almost
   no effect on half-life (lwao, et. al. (2007) B.B.A. Proteins and Proteomics 1774, 1582-1590).

 5         W02011/051489 and W02012/150319 disclose a number of point mutations in albumin
   which modulate the binding of albumin to FcRn. W02010/092135 discloses a number of point
   mutations in albumin which increase the number of thiols available for conjugation in the
   albumin, the disclosure is silent about the affect of the mutations on the binding of the albumin
   to FcRn. W02011/103076 discloses albumin variants, each containing a substitution in Domain
 0 Ill of HSA. W02012/112188 discloses albumin variants containing substitutions in Domain Ill of
   HSA.
           Albumin has the ability to bind a number of ligands and these become associated
   (associates) with albumin. This property has been utilized to extend the plasma half-life of
   drugs having the ability to non-covalently bind to albumin. This can also be achieved by binding
 5 a pharmaceutical beneficial compound, which has little or no albumin binding properties, to a
   moiety having albumin binding properties, see review article and reference therein, Kratz (2008)
   Journal of Controlled Release 132, 171-183.
           Albumin is used in preparations of pharmaceutically beneficial compounds, in which
   such a preparation may be for example, but not limited to, a nanoparticle or microparticle of
 0 albumin. In these examples the delivery of a pharmaceutically beneficial compound or mixture
   of compounds may benefit from alteration in the albumin's affinity to its receptor where the
   beneficial compound has been shown to associate with albumin for the means of delivery. It is
   not clear what determines the plasma half-life of the formed associates (for example but not
   limited to Levemir@, Kurtzhals P et al. Biochem. J. 1995; 312:725-731), conjugates or fusion
a5 polypeptides but it appears to be a result of the combination of the albumin and the selected
   pharmaceutically beneficial compound/polypeptide. It would be desirable to be able to control
   the plasma half-life of given albumin conjugates, associates or albumin fusion polypeptides so
   that a longer or shorter plasma half-life can be achieved than given by the components of the
   association, conjugation or fusion, in order to be able to design a particular drug according to
30 the particulars of the indication intended to be treated.
           Albumin is known to accumulate and be catabolised in tumours, it has also been shown
   to accumulate in inflamed joints of rheumatoid arthritis sufferers. See review article and
   reference therein, Kratz (2008) Journal of Controlled Release 132, 171-183. It is envisaged that
   HSA variants with increased affinity for FcRn would be advantageous for the delivery of
35 pharmaceutically beneficial compounds.
            It may even be desirable to have variants of albumin that have little or no binding to
   FcRn in order to provide shorter half-lives or controlled serum pharmacokinetics as described by
   Kenanova et al (2009) J. Nucl. Med.; 50 (Supplement 2):1582).

             Kenanova et al (2010, Protein Engineering, Design & Selection 23(10): 789-798;
   W02010/118169) discloses a docking model comprising a structural model of domain Ill of HSA
   (solved at pH 7 to 8) and a structural model of FcRn (solved at pH 6.4). Kenanova et al
   discloses that positions 464, 505, 510, 531 and 535 in domain Ill potentially interact with FcRn.
 5 The histidines at positions 464, 510 and 535 were identified as being of particular interest by
   Chaudhury et al., (2006, op. cit.) and these were shown to have a significant reduction in affinity
   and shorter half-life in mouse by Kenanova (2010, op. cit.). However, the studies of Kenanova
   et al are limited to domain Ill of HSA and therefore do not consider HSA in its native intact
   configuration. Furthermore, the identified positions result in a decrease in affinity for the FcRn
 0 receptor.
            The present invention provides further variants having altered binding affinity to the
   FcRn receptor. The albumin moiety or moieties may therefore be used to tailor the binding
   affinity to FcRn and/or half-life of fusion polypeptides, conjugates, associates, nanoparticles and
   compositions comprising the albumin moiety.

   Definitions
30         Variant: The term "variant" means a polypeptide derived from a parent albumin by one
   or more (several) alteration(s), i.e., a substitution, insertion, and/or deletion, at one or more
   (several) positions. A substitution means a replacement of an amino acid occupying a position
   with a different amino acid; a deletion means removal of an amino acid occupying a position;
   and an insertion means adding 1 or more, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10, preferably 1-3
35 amino acids immediately adjacent an amino acid occupying a position. In relation to
   substitutions, 'immediately adjacent' may be to the N-side ('upstream') or C-side ('downstream')
   of the amino acid occupying a position ('the named amino acid'). Therefore, for an amino acid
   named/numbered 'X', the insertion may be at position 'X+1' ('downstream') or at position 'X-1'
                                                    5

   ('upstream').
             Mutant: The term "mutant" means a polynucleotide encoding a variant.
             Wild-Type Albumin: The term "wild-type" (WT) albumin means albumin having the
   same amino acid sequence as naturally found in an animal or in a human being.
 5           Parent Albumin: The term "parent" or "parent albumin" means an albumin to which an
   alteration is made by the hand of man to produce the albumin variants of the invention. The
   parent may be a naturally occurring (wild-type) polypeptide or an allele thereof, or even a
   variant thereof.
             Albumin: Albumins are proteins and constitute the most abundant protein in plasma in
 0 mammals and albumins from a long number of mammals have been characterized by
   biochemical methods and/or by sequence information. Several albumins, e.g., human serum
   albumin (HSA), have also been characterized crystallographically and the structure determined
   (HSA: He XM, Carter DC (July 1992). "Atomic structure and chemistry of human serum
   albumin". Nature 358 (6383): 209-15; horse albumin: Ho, J.X. et al. (2001). X-ray and primary
 5 structure of horse serum albumin (Equus caballus) at 0.27-nm resolution. Eur J Biochem.
   215(1):205-12).
             The term "albumin" means a protein having the same and/or very similar three
   dimensional (tertiary) structure as HSA or HSA domains and has similar properties to HSA or to
   the relevant domains. Similar three dimensional structures are for example the structures of the
 o albumins from the species mentioned herein. Some of the major properties of albumin are i) its
   ability to regulate plasma volume (oncotic activity), ii) a long plasma half-life of around 19 days ±
   5 days, iii) binding to FcRn, iv) ligand-binding, e.g. binding of endogenous molecules such as
   acidic, lipophilic compounds including bilirubin, fatty acids, hemin and thyroxine (see also table
   1 of Kragh-Hansen et al, 2002, Biol. Pharm. Bull. 25, 695, hereby incorporated by reference), v)
a5 binding of small organic compounds with acidic or electronegative features e.g. drugs such as
   warfarin, diazepam, ibuprofen and paclitaxel (see also table 1 of Kragh-Hansen et al, 2002, Biol.
   Pharm. Bull. 25, 695, hereby incorporated by reference). Not all of these properties need to be
   fulfilled in order to characterize a protein or fragment as an albumin. If a fragment, for example,
   does not comprise a domain responsible for binding of certain ligands or organic compounds
30 the variant of such a fragment will not be expected to have these properties either.
             Albumins have generally a long plasma half-life of approximately 20 days or longer, e.g.,
   HSA has a plasma half-life of 19 days. It is known that the long plasma half-life of HSA is
   mediated via interaction with its receptor FcRn, however, an understanding or knowledge of the
   exact mechanism behind the long half-life of HSA is not essential for the invention.
35           As examples of albumin proteins , more specifically albumin proteins which may be used
   as parent 'backbones' as a starting point for making the albumin variants according to the
   invention, can be mentioned human serum albumin (e.g. AAA98797 or P02768-1, SEQ ID NO:
   2 (mature), SEQ ID NO: 4 (immature)), primate serum albumin, (such as chimpanzee serum
                                                       6

   albumin (e.g. predicted sequence XP_517233.2 SEQ ID NO: 5), gorilla serum albumin or
   macaque serum albumin (e.g. NP_001182578, SEQ ID NO: 6), rodent serum albumin (such as
   hamster serum albumin (e.g. A6YF56, SEQ ID NO: 7), guinea pig serum albumin (e.g.
   Q6WDN9-1, SEQ ID NO: 8), mouse serum albumin (e.g. AAH49971 or P07724-1 Version 3,
 5 SEQ ID NO: 9) and rat serum albumin (e.g. AAH85359 or P02770-1 Version 2, SEQ ID NO:
   10))), bovine serum albumin (e.g. cow serum albumin P02769-1, SEQ ID NO: 11), equine
   serum albumin such as horse serum albumin (e.g. P35747-1, SEQ ID NO: 12) or donkey serum
   albumin (e.g. Q5XLE4-1, SEQ ID NO: 13), rabbit serum albumin (e.g. P49065-1 Version 2, SEQ
   ID NO: 14), goat serum albumin (e.g. ACF10391, SEQ ID NO: 15), sheep serum albumin (e.g.
 0 P14639-1, SEQ ID NO: 16), dog serum albumin (e.g. P49822-1, SEQ ID NO: 17), chicken
   serum albumin (e.g. P19121-1 Version 2, SEQ ID NO: 18) and pig serum albumin (e.g. P08835
   1 Version 2, SEQ ID NO: 19) or a polypeptide having at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94,
   95, 96, 97, 98 or at least 99% amino acid identity to such an albumin. The parent or reference
   albumin may be an artificial variant such as HSA. K573P (SEQ ID NO: 3) or a chimeric albumin
 5 such as the N-terminal of HSA and the C-terminal of macaca albumin (SEQ ID NO: 20), N
   terminal of HSA and the C-terminal of mouse albumin (SEQ ID NO: 21), N-terminal of HSA and
   the C-terminal of rabbit albumin (SEQ ID NO: 22), N-terminal of HSA and the C-terminal of
   sheep albumin (SEQ ID NO: 23).
           Other examples of albumin, which are also included in the scope of this application,
 0 include ovalbumin (e.g. P01012.pro: chicken ovalbumin; 073860.pro: turkey ovalbumin).
           HSA as disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 2 or any naturally occurring allele thereof, is the
   preferred parent albumin according to the invention. HSA is a protein consisting of 585 amino
   acid residues and has a molecular weight of 67 kDa. In its natural form it is not glycosylated.
   The skilled person will appreciate that natural alleles may exist having essentially the same
a5 properties as HSA but having one or more (several) amino acid changes compared to SEQ ID
   NO: 2, and the inventors also contemplate the use of such natural alleles as parent albumin
   according to the invention.
           The parent albumin, a fragment thereof, or albumin part of a fusion polypeptide
   comprising albumin or a fragment thereof according to the invention preferably has a sequence
30 identity to the sequence of HSA shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 of at least 60%, preferably at least
   70%, preferably at least 80%, preferably at least 85%, preferably at least 86%, preferably at
   least 87%, preferably at least 88%, preferably at least 89%, preferably at least 90%, preferably
   at least 91%, preferably at least 92%, preferably at least 93%, preferably at least 94%,
   preferably at least 95%, more preferred at least 96%, more preferred at least 97%, more
35 preferred at least 98% and most preferred at least 99%. It is preferred that the parent albumin
   maintains at least one of the major properties of albumin or a similar tertiary structure as an
   albumin, such as HSA. The sequence identity may be over the full-length of SEQ ID NO: 2 or
   over a molecule consisting or comprising of a fragment such as one or more (several) domains
                                                  7

   of SEQ ID NO: 2 such as a molecule consisting of or comprising domain Ill (e.g. SEQ ID NO:
   27), a molecule consisting of or comprising domain || and domain Ill (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 25), a
   molecule consisting of or comprising domain I and domain Ill (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 24), a molecule
   consisting of or comprising two copies of domain Ill (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 26), a molecule consisting
 5 of or comprising three copies of domain Ill (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 28) or a molecule consisting of or
   comprising domain I and two copies of domain Ill (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 29).
           The parent preferably comprises or consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID
   NO: 4 (immature sequence of HSA) or SEQ ID NO: 2 (mature sequence of HSA).
            In another embodiment, the parent is an allelic variant of the mature polypeptide of SEQ
 0 ID NO: 2.
           The parent albumin may be encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes under very low
   stringency conditions, low stringency conditions, medium stringency conditions, medium-high
   stringency conditions, high stringency conditions, or very high stringency conditions with (i) the
   mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or (ii) the full-length complementary
 5 strand of (i) (J. Sambrook, E.F. Fritsch, and T. Maniatis, 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory
   Manual, 2d edition, Cold Spring Harbor, New York).
           The polynucleotide of SEQ ID NO: 1 or a subsequence thereof, as well as the amino
   acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 or a fragment thereof, may be used to design nucleic acid
   probes to identify and clone DNA encoding a parent from strains of different genera or species
 O according to methods well known in the art. In particular, such probes can be used for
   hybridization with the genomic or cDNA of the genus or species of interest, following standard
   Southern blotting procedures, in order to identify and isolate the corresponding gene therein.
   Such probes can be considerably shorter than the entire sequence, but should be at least 14,
   e.g., at least 25, at least 35, or at least 70 nucleotides in length. Preferably, the nucleic acid
a5 probe is at least 100 nucleotides in length, e.g., at least 200 nucleotides, at least 300
   nucleotides, at least 400 nucleotides, at least 500 nucleotides, at least 600 nucleotides, at least
   700 nucleotides, at least 800 nucleotides, or at least 900 nucleotides in length. Both DNA and
   RNA probes can be used. The probes are typically labelled for detecting the corresponding
                              32
   gene (for example, with       P, 3 H, 35S, biotin, or avidin). Such probes are encompassed by the
30 invention.
           A genomic DNA or cDNA library prepared from such other organisms may be screened
   for DNA that hybridizes with the probes described above and encodes a parent. Genomic or
   other DNA from such other organisms may be separated by agarose or polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis, or other separation techniques. DNA from the libraries or the separated DNA
35 may be transferred to and immobilized on nitrocellulose or other suitable carrier material. In
   order to identify a clone or DNA that is homologous with SEQ ID NO: 1 or a subsequence
   thereof, the carrier material is used in a Southern blot.
            For purposes of the invention, hybridization indicates that the polynucleotide hybridizes
                                                        8

   to a labelled nucleotide probe corresponding to the polynucleotide shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, its
   complementary strand, or a subsequence thereof, under low to very high stringency conditions.
   Molecules to which the probe hybridizes can be detected using, for example, X-ray film or any
   other detection means known in the art.
 5         The nucleic acid probe may comprise or consist of the mature polypeptide coding
   sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, i.e. nucleotides 1 to 1785 of SEQ ID NO: 1.The nucleic acid probe
   may comprise or consist of a polynucleotide that encodes the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or a
   fragment thereof.
           For long probes of at least 100 nucleotides in length, very low to very high stringency
 0 conditions are defined as pre-hybridization and hybridization at 420C in 5X SSPE, 0.3% SDS,
   200 micrograms/ml sheared and denatured salmon sperm DNA, and either 25% formamide for
   very low and low stringencies, 35% formamide for medium and medium-high stringencies, or
   50% formamide for high and very high stringencies, following standard Southern blotting
   procedures for 12 to 24 hours optimally. The carrier material is finally washed three times each
 5 for 15 minutes using 2X SSC, 0.2% SDS at 450C (very low stringency), 500C (low stringency),
   550C (medium stringency), 600C (medium-high stringency), 650C (high stringency), or 700C
   (very high stringency).
           For short probes that are about 15 nucleotides to about 70 nucleotides in length,
   stringency conditions are defined as pre-hybridization and hybridization at about 50C to about
 0 100C below the calculated Tm using the calculation according to Bolton and McCarthy (1962,
   Proc. Nat/. Acad. Sci. USA 48: 1390) in 0.9 M NaCl, 0.09 M Tris-HCI pH 7.6, 6 mM EDTA, 0.5%
   NP-40, 1X Denhardt's solution, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium monobasic
   phosphate, 0.1 mM ATP, and 0.2 mg of yeast RNA per ml following standard Southern blotting
   procedures for 12 to 24 hours optimally. The carrier material is finally washed once in 6X SCC
a5 plus 0.1% SDS for 15 minutes and twice each for 15 minutes using 6X SSC at 50C to 100C
   below the calculated Tm.
           The parent may be encoded by a polynucleotide with a sequence identity to the mature
   polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 of at least 60%, e.g., at least 65%, at least 70%,
   at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%,
30 at least 98%, at least 99%, or 100%, which encodes a polypeptide which is able to function as
   an albumin. In an embodiment, the parent is encoded by a polynucleotide comprising or
   consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1.
           Albumin moiety: The albumin part of a fusion polypeptide, conjugate, associate,
   nanoparticle or composition comprising the albumin variant or fragment thereof according to the
35 invention, may be referred to as an 'albumin moiety' or 'albumin component'. A polypeptide
   according to the invention may comprise or consist of an albumin moiety.
           FcRn and shFcRn: The term "FcRn" means the human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn).
   shFcRn is a soluble recombinant form of FcRn. hFcRn is a heterodimer of SEQ ID NO: 30
                                                   9

   (truncated heavy chain of the major histocompatibility complex class I-like Fc receptor
   (FCGRT)) and SEQ ID NO: 31 (beta-2-microglobulin). Together, SEQ ID NO: 30 and 31 form
   hFcRn.
            Isolated variant: The term "isolated variant" means a variant in a form or environment
 5 which does not occur in nature. Non-limiting examples of isolated variants include (1) any non
   naturally occurring variant, (2) any variant that is at least partially removed from one or more
   (several) or all of the naturally occurring constituents with which it is associated in nature; (3)
   any variant modified by the hand of man relative to the polypeptide from which it is derived (e.g.
   the polypeptide from which it is derived as found in nature); or (4) any variant modified by
 0 increasing the amount of the variant e relative to other components with which it is naturally
   associated (e.g., multiple copies of a gene encoding the substance; use of a stronger promoter
   than the promoter naturally associated with the gene encoding the substance). An isolated
   variant may be present in a fermentation broth sample.
            Substantially pure variant: The term "substantially pure variant" means a preparation
 5 that contains at most 10%, at most 8%, at most 6%, at most 5%, at most 4%, at most 3%, at
   most 2%, at most 1%, and at most 0.5% by weight of other polypeptide material with which it is
   natively or recombinantly associated. Preferably, the variant is at least 92% pure, e.g., at least
   94% pure, at least 95% pure, at least 96% pure, at least 97% pure, at least 98% pure, at least
   99%, at least 99.5% pure, and 100% pure by weight of the total polypeptide material present in
 O the preparation. Purity may be determined by SDS-PAGE or GP-HPLC. The variants of the
   invention are preferably in a substantially pure form. This can be accomplished, for example, by
   preparing the variant by well-known recombinant methods and by purification methods.
            Mature polypeptide: The term "mature polypeptide" means a polypeptide in its final
   form following translation and any post-translational modifications, such as N-terminal
a5 processing, C-terminal truncation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, etc. The mature polypeptide
   may be amino acids 1 to 585 of SEQ ID NO: 2, e.g. with the inclusion of alterations according to
   the invention and/or any post-translational modifications.
            Mature polypeptide coding sequence:            The   term "mature polypeptide coding
   sequence" means a polynucleotide that encodes a mature albumin polypeptide. The mature
30 polypeptide coding sequence may be nucleotides 1 to 1758 of SEQ ID NO: 1 e.g. with the
   alterations required to encode a variant according to the invention.
            Sequence Identity:
            The relatedness between two amino acid sequences or between two nucleotide
   sequences is described by the parameter "sequence identity".
35          For purposes of the present invention, the sequence identity between two amino acid
   sequences is determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch,
   1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of the EMBOSS
   package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000,

   Trends Genet. 16: 276-277), preferably version 5.0.0 or later. The parameters used are gap
   open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EBLOSUM62 (EMBOSS version of
   BLOSUM62) substitution matrix. The output of Needle labeled "longest identity" (obtained using
   the -nobrief option) is used as the percent identity and is calculated as follows:
 5       (Identical Residues x 100)/(Length of Alignment - Total Number of Gaps in Alignment)
            For purposes of the present invention, the sequence identity between two
   deoxyribonucleotide sequences is determined using the Need leman-Wunsch algorithm
   (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, supra) as implemented in the Needle program of the EMBOSS
   package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000,
 0 supra), preferably version 5.0.0 or later. The parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap
   extension penalty of 0.5, and the EDNAFULL (EMBOSS version of NCBI NUC4.4) substitution
   matrix. The output of Needle labeled "longest identity" (obtained using the -nobrief option) is
   used as the percent identity and is calculated as follows:
   (Identical Deoxyribonucleotides x 100)/(Length of Alignment - Total Number of Gaps in
 5 Alignment)
            Fragment: The term "fragment" means a polypeptide having one or more (several)
   amino acids deleted from the amino and/or carboxyl terminus of an albumin and/or an internal
   region of albumin that has retained the ability to bind to FcRn. Fragments may consist of one
 0 uninterrupted sequence derived from HSA or it may comprise two or more sequences derived
   from HSA. The fragments according to the invention have a size of more than approximately 20
   amino acid residues, preferably more than 30 amino acid residues, more preferred more than
   40 amino acid residues, more preferred more than 50 amino acid residues, more preferred more
   than 75 amino acid residues, more preferred more than 100 amino acid residues, more
a5 preferred more than 200 amino acid residues, more preferred more than 300 amino acid
   residues, even more preferred more than 400 amino acid residues and most preferred more
   than 500 amino acid residues. A fragment may comprise or consist of one more domains of
   albumin such as DI + DII, DI + DIII, DII + DIII, DIII + DIII, DI + DIII + DIII, DIII + DIII +Dlll, or
   fragments of such domains or combinations of domains.
30          Domains 1,11 and Ill may be defined with reference to HSA (SEQ ID NO: 2). For
   example, HSA domain I may consist of or comprise amino acids 1 to 194 (± 1 to 15 amino
   acids) of SEQ ID NO: 2, HSA domain || may consist of or comprise amino acids 192 (± 1 to 15
   amino acids) to 387 (± 1 to 15 amino acids) of SEQ ID NO: 2 and domain Ill may consist of or
   comprise amino acid residues 381 (± 1 to 15 amino acids) to 585 (± 1 to 15 amino acids) of
35 SEQ ID NO: 2. "± 1 to 15 amino acids" means that the residue number may deviate by 1, 2, 3,
   4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 amino acids to the C-terminus and/or to the N-terminus
   of the stated amino acid position. Examples of domains 1,11 and Ill are described by Dockal et
   al (The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 1999, Vol. 274(41): 29303-29310) and Kjeldsen et al

            The skilled person can identify domains 1,11 and Ill in non-human albumins by amino
   acid sequence alignment with HSA, for example using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
   (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle
 5 program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software
   Suite, Rice et al., 2000, Trends Genet. 16: 276-277), preferably version 3.0.0 or later. The
   optional parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the
   EBLOSUM62 (EMBOSS version of BLOSUM62) substitution matrix. Other suitable software
   includes MUSCLE ((Multiple sequence comparison by log-expectation, Robert C. Edgar,
 0 Version 3.6, http://www.drive5.com/muscle; Edgar (2004) Nucleic Acids Research 32(5), 1792
   97 and Edgar (2004) BMC Bioinformatics, 5(1):113) which may be used with the default settings
   as described in the User Guide (Version 3.6, September 2005). Versions of MUSCLE later than
   3.6 may also be used for any aspect of the invention). Examples of suitable alignments are
   provided in Figures 1 and 2.
 5          It is preferred that domains have at least 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 99.5 %
   identity or 100% identity to Domain 1,11or Ill of HSA (SEQ ID NO: 2).
            Allelic variant: The term "allelic variant" means any of two or more alternative forms of
   a gene occupying the same chromosomal locus. Allelic variation arises naturally through
   mutation, and may result in polymorphism within populations. Gene mutations can be silent (no
20 change in the encoded polypeptide) or may encode polypeptides having altered amino acid
   sequences. An allelic variant of a polypeptide is a polypeptide encoded by an allelic variant of a
   gene.
            Coding sequence: The term "coding sequence" means a polynucleotide, which directly
   specifies the amino acid sequence of its translated polypeptide product. The boundaries of the
25 coding sequence are generally determined by an open reading frame, which usually begins with
   the ATG start codon or alternative start codons such as GTG and TTG and ends with a stop
   codon such as TAA, TAG, and TGA. The coding sequence may be a DNA, cDNA, synthetic, or
   recombinant polynucleotide.
            cDNA: The term "cDNA" means a DNA molecule that can be prepared by reverse
30 transcription from a mature, spliced, mRNA molecule obtained from a eukaryotic cell. cDNA
   lacks intron sequences that may be present in the corresponding genomic DNA. The initial,
   primary RNA transcript is a precursor to mRNA that is processed through a series of steps,
                                                     12

   including splicing, before appearing as mature spliced mRNA.
            Nucleic acid construct: The term "nucleic acid construct" means a nucleic acid
   molecule, either single- or double-stranded, which is isolated from a naturally occurring gene or
   is modified to contain segments of nucleic acids in a manner that would not otherwise exist in
 5 nature or which is synthetic. The term nucleic acid construct is synonymous with the term
   "expression cassette" when the nucleic acid construct contains the control sequences required
   for expression of a coding sequence of the invention.
            Control sequences: The term "control sequences" means all nucleic acid sequences
   necessary for the expression of a polynucleotide encoding a variant of the invention. Each
 0 control sequence may be native (i.e. from the same gene) or foreign (i.e. from a different gene)
   to the polynucleotide encoding the variant or native or foreign to each other. Such control
   sequences include, but are not limited to, a leader, polyadenylation sequence, propeptide
   sequence, promoter, signal peptide sequence, and transcription terminator. At a minimum, the
   control sequences include a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The
 5 control sequences may be provided with linkers for the purpose of introducing specific restriction
   sites facilitating ligation of the control sequences with the coding region of the polynucleotide
   encoding a variant.
            Operably linked: The term "operably linked" means a configuration in which a control
   sequence is placed at an appropriate position relative to the coding sequence of a
 o polynucleotide such that the control sequence directs the expression of the coding sequence.
            Expression: The term "expression" includes any step involved in the production of the
   variant including, but not limited to, transcription, post-transcriptional modification, translation,
   post-translational modification, and secretion.
            Expression vector: The term "expression vector" means a linear or circular DNA
a5 molecule that comprises a polynucleotide encoding a variant and is operably linked to control
   sequences that provide for its expression.
            Host cell: The term "host cell" means any cell type that is susceptible to transformation,
   transfection, transduction, or the like with a nucleic acid construct or expression vector
   comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention. The term "host cell" encompasses any
30 progeny of a parent cell that is not identical to the parent cell due to mutations that occur during
   replication.
            Plasma half-life: Plasma half-life is ideally determined in vivo in suitable individuals.
   However, since it is time consuming and expensive and there inevitable are ethical concerns
   connected with doing experiments in animals or man it is desirable to use an in vitro assay for
35 determining whether plasma half-life is extended or reduced. It is known that the binding of
   albumin to its receptor FcRn is important for plasma half-life and the correlation between
   receptor binding and plasma half-life is that a higher affinity of albumin to its receptor leads to
   longer plasma half-life. Thus for the invention a higher affinity of albumin to FcRn is considered
                                                      13

   indicative of an increased plasma half-life and a lower affinity of albumin to its receptor is
   considered indicative of a reduced plasma half-life.
            In this application and claims the binding of albumin to its receptor FcRn is described
   using the term affinity and the expressions "stronger" or "weaker". Thus, it should be understood
 5 that a molecule having a higher affinity to FcRn than HSA is considered to bind stronger to
   FcRn than HSA and a molecule having a lower affinity to FcRn than HSA is considered to bind
   weaker to FcRn than HSA.
           The terms "longer plasma half-life" or "shorter plasma half-life" and similar expressions
   are understood to be in relationship to the corresponding parent or reference or corresponding
 0 albumin molecule. Thus, a longer plasma half-life with respect to a variant albumin of the
   invention means that the variant has longer plasma half-life than the corresponding albumin
   having the same sequences except for the alteration(s) described herein, e.g. at two or more
   positions corresponding to 492, 550, 573, 574 and 580 of HSA (SEQ ID NO: 2).
           Reference: a reference is an albumin, fusion, conjugate, composition, associate or
 5 nanoparticle to which an albumin variant, fusion, conjugate, composition, associate or
   nanoparticle is compared. The reference may comprise or consist of full length albumin (such as
   HSA or a natural allele thereof) or a fragment thereof. A reference may also be referred to as a
   'corresponding' albumin, fusion, conjugate, composition, associate or nanoparticle to which an
   albumin variant, fusion, conjugate, composition, associate or nanoparticle is compared. A
 O reference may comprise or consist of HSA (SEQ ID NO: 2) or a fragment, fusion, conjugate,
   associate, nanoparticle or microparticle thereof. Preferably, the reference is identical to the
   polypeptide, fusion polypeptide, conjugate, composition, associate, nanoparticle or microparticle
   according to the invention ("being studied") with the exception of the albumin moiety. Preferably
   the albumin moiety of the reference comprises or consists of an albumin (e.g. HSA, SEQ ID NO:
e5 2) or a fragment thereof. The amino acid sequence of the albumin moiety of the reference may
   be longer than, shorter than or, preferably, the same (± 1 to 15 amino acids) length as the
   amino sequence of the albumin moiety of the polypeptide, fusion polypeptide, conjugate,
   composition, associate, nanoparticle or microparticle according to the invention ("being
   studied").
30         Equivalent amino acid positions: Throughout this specification amino acid positions
   are defined in relation to full-length mature human serum albumin (i.e. without leader sequence,
   SEQ ID NO: 2). However, the skilled person understands that the invention also relates to
   variants of non-human albumins (e.g. those disclosed herein) and/or fragments of a human or
   non-human albumin. Equivalent positions can be identified in fragments of human serum
35 albumin, in animal albumins and in fragments, fusions and other derivative or variants thereof by
   comparing amino acid sequences using pairwise (e.g. ClustalW) or multiple (e.g. MUSCLE)
   alignments. For example, Fig. 1 shows that positions equivalent to 500, 550 and 573 in full
   length human serum albumin are easily identified in fragments of human serum albumin and in
                                                    14

   albumins of other species. Positions 500, 550 and 573 are indicated by arrows. Further details

            Fig. 1 was generated by MUSCLE using the default parameters including output in
   ClustalW 1.81 format. The raw output data was shaded using BoxShade 3.21

10 10; Consensus Line: no consensus line; Fraction of sequences (that must agree for shading):
   0.5; Input sequence format: ALN. Therefore, throughout this specification amino acid positions
   defined in human serum albumin also apply to equivalent positions in fragments, derivatives or
   variants and fusions of human serum albumin, animals from other species and fragments and
   fusions thereof. Such equivalent positions may have (i) a different residue number in its native
15 protein and/or (ii) a different native amino acid in its native protein.
            Likewise, Fig. 2 shows that equivalent positions can be identified in fragments (e.g.
   domains) of an albumin with reference to SEQ ID NO: 2 (HSA).
   Conventions for Designation of Variants
20          For purposes of the present invention, the mature polypeptide disclosed in SEQ ID NO:
   2 is used to determine the corresponding amino acid residue in another albumin. The amino
                                                      15

   acid sequence of another albumin is aligned with the mature polypeptide disclosed in SEQ ID
   NO: 2, and based on the alignment, the amino acid position number corresponding to any
   amino acid residue in the mature polypeptide disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 2 is determined using
   the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) as
 5 implemented in the Needle program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European
   Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000, Trends Genet. 16: 276-277),
   preferably version 5.0.0 or later. The parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap
   extension penalty of 0.5, and the EBLOSUM62 (EMBOSS version of BLOSUM62) substitution
   matrix.
 0         Identification of the corresponding amino acid residue in another albumin can be
   determined or confirmed by an alignment of multiple polypeptide sequences using several
   computer programs including, but not limited to, MUSCLE (multiple sequence comparison by
   log-expectation; version 3.5 or later; Edgar, 2004, Nucleic Acids Research 32: 1792-1797),
   MAFFT (version 6.857 or later; Katoh and Kuma, 2002, Nucleic Acids Research 30: 3059-3066;
 5 Katoh et al., 2005, Nucleic Acids Research 33: 511-518; Katoh and Toh, 2007, Bioinformatics
   23: 372-374; Katoh et al., 2009, Methods in Molecular Biology 537:_39-64; Katoh and Toh,
   2010, Bioinformatics 26:_1899-1900), and EMBOSS EMMA employing ClustalW (1.83 or later;
   Thompson et al., 1994, Nucleic Acids Research 22: 4673-4680), using their respective default
   parameters.
 0         When the other polypeptide (or protein) has diverged from the mature polypeptide of
   SEQ ID NO: 2 such that traditional sequence-based comparison fails to detect their relationship
   (Lindahl and Elofsson, 2000, J. Mol. Biol. 295: 613-615), other pairwise sequence comparison
   algorithms can be used. Greater sensitivity in sequence-based searching can be attained using
   search programs that utilize probabilistic representations of polypeptide families (profiles) to
e5 search databases. For example, the PSI-BLAST program generates profiles through an iterative
   database search process and is capable of detecting remote homologs (Atschul et al., 1997,
   Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402). Even greater sensitivity can be achieved if the family or
   superfamily for the polypeptide has one or more representatives in the protein structure
   databases. Programs such as GenTHREADER (Jones, 1999, J. Mol. Biol. 287: 797-815;
30 McGuffin and Jones, 2003, Bioinformatics 19: 874-881) utilize information from a variety of
   sources (PSI-BLAST, secondary structure prediction, structural alignment profiles, and solvation
   potentials) as input to a neural network that predicts the structural fold for a query sequence.
   Similarly, the method of Gough et al., 2000, J. Mol. Biol. 313: 903-919, can be used to align a
   sequence of unknown structure with the superfamily models present in the SCOP database.
35 These alignments can in turn be used to generate homology models for the polypeptide, and
   such models can be assessed for accuracy using a variety of tools developed for that purpose.
           For proteins of known structure, several tools and resources are available for retrieving
   and generating structural alignments. For example the SCOP superfamilies of proteins have
                                                   16

    been structurally aligned, and those alignments are accessible and downloadable. Two or more
    protein structures can be aligned using a variety of algorithms such as the distance alignment
    matrix (Holm and Sander, 1998, Proteins 33: 88-96) or combinatorial extension (Shindyalov and
    Bourne, 1998, Protein Engineering 11: 739-747), and implementation of these algorithms can
  5 additionally be utilized to query structure databases with a structure of interest in order to
    discover possible structural homologs (e.g., Holm and Park, 2000, Bioinformatics 16: 566-567).
             In describing the albumin variants of the present invention, the nomenclature described
    below is adapted for ease of reference. The accepted IUPAC single letter or three letter amino
    acid abbreviation is employed. The term 'point mutation' and/or 'alteration' includes deletions,
  0 insertions and substitutions.
             Substitutions. For an amino acid substitution, the following nomenclature is used:
    Original amino acid, position, substituted amino acid. Accordingly, the substitution of threonine
    at position 226 with alanine is designated as "Thr226Ala" or "T226A". Multiple mutations (or
    alterations) are separated by addition marks ("+"), e.g., "Gly205Arg + Ser4l 1Phe" or "G205R +
  5 S411 F", representing substitutions at positions 205 and 411 of glycine (G) with arginine (R) and
    serine (S) with phenylalanine (F), respectively. The Figures also use ("/"), e.g., "E492T/N503D"
    this should be viewed as interchangeable with ("+").
             Deletions. For an amino acid deletion, the following nomenclature is used: Original
    amino acid, position*. Accordingly, the deletion of glycine at position 195 is designated as
  o "Gly195* or "G195*". Multiple deletions are separated by addition marks ("+"), e.g., "Gly195* +
    Ser4l 1* or "G1 95* + S411*".
             Insertions. As disclosed above, an insertion may be to the N-side ('upstream', 'X-1') or
    C-side ('downstream', 'X+1') of the amino acid occupying a position ('the named (or original)
    amino acid', 'X').
,-5          For an amino acid insertion to the C-side ('downstream', 'X+1') of the original amino acid
    ('X'), the following nomenclature is used: Original amino acid, position, original amino acid,
    inserted amino acid. Accordingly the insertion of lysine after glycine at position 195 is
    designated "Glyl95GlyLys"or "G195GK". An insertion of multiple amino acids is designated
    [Original amino acid, position, original amino acid, inserted amino acid #1, inserted amino acid
30  #2; etc.]. For example, the insertion of lysine and alanine after glycine at position 195 is
    indicated as "Glyl 95GlyLysAla" or "G1 95GKA".
             In such cases the inserted amino acid residue(s) are numbered by the addition of lower
    case letters to the position number of the amino acid residue preceding the inserted amino acid
    residue(s). In the above example, the sequence would thus be:
                                     Parent:       Variant:
                                     195            195195a195b
                                     G             G - K - A
                                                     17

            For an amino acid insertion to the N-side ('upstream', 'X-1') of the original amino acid
   (X), the following nomenclature is used: Original amino acid, position, inserted amino acid,
   original amino acid. Accordingly the insertion of lysine (K) before glycine (G) at position 195 is
 5 designated "Glyl95LysGly"or "G195KG". An insertion of multiple amino acids is designated
   [Original amino acid, position, inserted amino acid #1, inserted amino acid #2; etc., original
   amino acid]. For example, the insertion of lysine (K) and alanine (A) before glycine at position
   195 is indicated as "Glyl95LysAlaGly" or "G195KAG". In such cases the inserted amino acid
   residue(s) are numbered by the addition of lower case letters with prime to the position number
 0 of the amino acid residue following the inserted amino acid residue(s). In the above example,
   the sequence would thus be:
                                     Parent:       Variant:
                                     195           195a'195b'195
                                     G             K - A - G
            Multiple alterations. Variants comprising multiple alterations are separated by addition
 5 marks ("+"), e.g., "Arg170Tyr+Gly195Glu" or "R170Y+G195E" representing a substitution of
   arginine and glycine at positions 170 and 195 tyrosine and glutamic acid, respectively.
            Different alterations. Where different alterations can be introduced at a position, the
   different alterations are separated by a comma, e.g., "Arg170Tyr,Glu" represents a substitution
   of arginine at position 170 with tyrosine or glutamic acid. Thus, "Tyr1 67Gly,Ala + Arg1 70Gly,Ala"
 O designates the following variants:
   "Tyr167Gly+Arg170Gly", "Tyr167Gly+Arg170Ala", "Tyr167Ala+Arg170Gly", and
   "Tyr1 67Ala+Arg1 70Ala".

 5 described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i) and (j).
             A preferred alteration is a substitution.
             It is preferred that the parent albumin and/or the variant albumin comprises or consists
   of:

   or fragments thereof comprise alterations, such as substitutions, deletions or insertions at two or
30 more of positions selected among the group consisting of positions 492, 550, 573, 574 and 580
   of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or in equivalent positions of other albumins or
   variants or fragments thereof. A stop codon may be introduced in addition to the alterations
   described herein and if introduced is at position 574 or further downstream (e.g. in SEQ ID NO:
   2 it is introduced at from position 574 to 585).

             In one aspect, the number of alterations in the variants of the invention is 1 to 20, e.g., 1
    to 10 and 1 to 5, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 alterations relative to SEQ ID NO: 2 or
    relative to the sequence of the parent albumin.
  5         At position 492 of SEQ ID NO: 2 (or equivalent position of other albumins or variants or
    fragments thereof), it is preferred that the alteration is a substitution, such as from the native
    amino acid to A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, Y, more preferred to G, D, F,
    H, M or R, even more preferred to G, or D and most preferred to G. In SEQ ID NO: 2 the native
    amino acid at position 492 is E, therefore a substitution to E is not preferred.
  O         At position 550 of SEQ ID NO: 2 (or equivalent position of other albumins or variants or
    fragments thereof), it is preferred that the alteration is a substitution, such as from the native

    W, H, F, T, I or V, even more preferred to P, Y or W and most preferred to P. In SEQ ID NO: 2
    the native amino acid at position 573 is K, therefore a substitution to K is not preferred.
30          At position 574 of SEQ ID NO: 2 (or equivalent position of other albumins or variants or
    fragments thereof), it is preferred that the alteration is a substitution, such as from the native
    amino acid to A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, Y, more preferred to H, G,
    D, F, N, S or Y, even more preferred to D, F, G or H and most preferred to H. In SEQ ID NO: 2
    the native amino acid at position 574 is K, therefore a substitution to K is not preferred.
35          At position 580 of SEQ ID NO: 2 (or equivalent position of other albumins or variants or
    fragments thereof), it is preferred that the alteration is a substitution, such as from the native
    amino acid to A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, Y, more preferred to K or R,
    most preferred to K. In SEQ ID NO: 2 the native amino acid at position 580 is Q, therefore a
                                                     21

   substitution to Q is not preferred.
           A variant albumin may comprise alterations at positions corresponding to positions
   492+550 of SEQ ID NO: 2 (or equivalent position of other albumins or variants or fragments
   thereof). Such alterations may comprise 492D+550K (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 231), or 492G+550K
 5 (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 240).
           A variant albumin may comprise alterations at positions corresponding to positions
   492+573 of SEQ ID NO: 2 (or equivalent position of other albumins or variants or fragments
   thereof). Such alterations may comprise 492F+573P           (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 109), 492G+573P
   (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 110), 492H+573P (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 111) or 492R+573P (e.g. SEQ ID NO:
 0 113) or more preferably 492D+573P (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 108). However, it is preferred that the
   variant does not consist of SEQ ID NO: 2 with only alterations 492G+573A, 492G+573A,
   492G+N503K+573A,           492G+N503H+573A,         492G+573P,        492G+N503K+573 P o r
   492G+N503H+573P.

   PNLVTRCKDALA, (d) PKLVESSKATLG or (e) PKLVASTQAALA.
           It is preferred that the variant albumin, a fragment thereof or fusion polypeptide
   comprising the variant albumin or fragment thereof has altered binding affinity to FcRn and/or
 o an altered plasma half-life compared with the corresponding parent or reference albumin,
   fragment thereof, or fusion polypeptide comprising the variant albumin or fragment thereof
   and/or an altered binding affinity to FcRn.
           In a particularly preferred embodiment the parent or reference albumin is HSA (SEQ ID
   NO: 2) and the variant albumin, a fragment thereof or fusion polypeptide comprising the variant
e5 albumin or fragment thereof has altered binding affinity to FcRn and/or an altered plasma half
   life compared with the HSA, the corresponding fragment or fusion polypeptide comprising HSA
   or fragment thereof and/or an altered binding affinity to FcRn.
           The correlation between binding of albumin to its receptor and plasma half-life has been
   realized by the present inventors based on the natural occurring allele of HSA D494N. The
30 inventors have previously analyzed this allele and found that it has a lower affinity to its receptor
   FcRn than the affinity of WT HSA to FcRn.
           Further, it has been disclosed that a transgenic mouse having the natural mouse FcRn
   replaced with human FcRn has a higher serum albumin level than normal mouse (J Exp Med.
   (2003) 197(3):315-22). It has previously been discovered that human FcRn has a higher affinity
35 to mouse serum albumin than mouse FcRn has to mouse serum albumin and, therefore, the
   observed increase in serum albumin in the transgenic mice corresponds with a higher affinity
   between serum albumin and its receptor, confirming the correlation between albumin binding to
   FcRn and plasma half-life. In addition, variants of albumin that have little or no binding to FcRn
                                                    27

   have been shown to have reduced half-life in a mouse model, Kenanova et al (2009) J. Nucl.
   Med.; 50 (Supplement 2):1582).
           One way to determine whether the affinity of a variant albumin to FcRn is higher or lower
   than the parent or reference albumin is to use the Surface Plasmon Resonance assay (SPR) as
 5 described below. The skilled person will understand that other methods might be useful to
   determine whether the affinity of a variant albumin to FcRn is higher or lower than the affinity of
   the parent or reference albumin to FcRn, e.g., determination and comparison of the binding
   constants KD. The binding affinity (KD) between a first molecule (e.g. ligand) and a second
   molecule (e.g. receptor) is a function of the kinetic constants for association (on rate, ka) and
 0 dissociation (off-rate, kd) according to KD= kd/ka. Thus, according to the invention variant
   albumins having a KD that is lower than the KD for natural HSA is considered to have a higher
   plasma half-life than HSA and variant albumins having a KD that is higher than the KD for
   natural HSA is considered to have a lower plasma half-life than HSA.
            In an embodiment of the invention, the variants of albumin or fragments thereof, or
 5 fusion polypeptides comprising variant albumin or a fragment thereof according to the invention
   have a plasma half-life that is longer than the plasma half-life of the parent or reference albumin
   fragment thereof or fusion polypeptide comprising the parent or reference albumin or a fragment
   thereof and/or an stronger binding affinity to FcRn.
            In a further embodiment the variants of albumin or fragments thereof, or fusion
 o polypeptides comprising variant albumin or fragments thereof according to the invention have a
   plasma half-life that is shorter than the plasma half-life of the parent or reference albumin
   fragment thereof or fusion polypeptide comprising the parent or reference albumin or a fragment
   thereof and/or an weaker binding affinity to FcRn.
            In addition to alterations at two or more positions selected from 492, 550, 573, 574
a5 and/or 580 (or equivalent position of other albumins or variants or fragments thereof) the variant
   albumin or fragments thereof, or fusion polypeptides comprising variant albumin or fragments
   thereof according to the invention may contain additional substitutions, deletions or insertions in
   other positions of the molecules. Such additional substitutions, deletions or insertions may be
   useful in order to alter other properties of the molecules such as but not limited to altered
30 glycosylation; introduction of reactive groups of the surface              such    a thiol   groups,
   removing/generating a carbamoylation site; etc.
            Residues that might be altered in order to provide reactive residues on the surface and
   which advantageously could be applied to the invention has been disclosed in W02010/092135
   (incorporated herein by reference). Particular preferred residues include the positions
35 corresponding to positions in SEQ ID NO: 2.
           As examples of alterations that can be made in SEQ ID NO: 2 or in corresponding
   positions in other albumins in order to provide a reactive thiol group on the surface includes
   alterations corresponding to following alterations in SEQ ID NO: 2: L585C, D1C, A2C, D562C,

   C558*, C361*, C91*, C124*, C169* and C567*. Alternatively a cysteine residue may be added
 5 to the N or C terminal of albumin. The term 'reactive thiol' means and/or includes a thiol group
   provided by a Cys which is not disulphide bonded to a Cysteine and/or which is sterically
   available for binding to a partner such as a conjugation partner.
   Fusion polypeptides
 0          A second aspect of the invention relates to fusion polypeptides. Therefore, the variants
   of albumin or fragments thereof according to the invention may be fused with a non-albumin
   polypeptide fusion partner. The fusion partner may in principle be any polypeptide but generally
   it is preferred that the fusion partner is a polypeptide having therapeutic, prophylactic (including
   vaccine), diagnostic, imaging or other beneficial properties. Such properties may be referred to
 5 as 'pharmaceutically beneficial properties'. Fusion polypeptides comprising albumin or
   fragments thereof are known in the art. It has been found that such fusion polypeptides
   comprising albumin or a fragment thereof and a fusion partner polypeptide have a longer
   plasma half-life compared to the unfused fusion partner polypeptide alone. According to the
   invention it is possible to alter the plasma half-life of the fusion polypeptides according to the
 o invention compared to the corresponding fusion polypeptides of the prior art. 'Alter' includes
   both increasing the plasma half-life or decreasing the plasma half-life. Increasing the plasma
   half-life is preferred. The invention allows tailoring of half-life to a term desired.
            One or more (several) therapeutic, prophylactic (including vaccine), diagnostic, imaging
   or other beneficial polypeptides may be fused to the N-terminus, the C-terminus of albumin,
e5 inserted into a loop in the albumin structure or any combination thereof. It may or it may not
   comprise linker sequences separating the various components of the fusion polypeptide.
            Teachings relating to fusions of albumin or a fragment thereof are known in the art and
   the skilled person will appreciate that such teachings can also be applied to the invention. WO
   2001/79271A (particularly page 9 and/or Table 1), WO 2003/59934 (particularly Table 1),
30 W003/060071 (particularly Table 1) and W001/079480 (particularly Table 1) (each incorporated
   herein by reference in their entirety) also contain examples of therapeutic, prophylactic
   (including vaccine), diagnostic, imaging or other beneficial polypeptides that may be fused to
   albumin or fragments thereof, and these examples apply also to the invention.
             Further preferences for the second aspect of the invention include those of the first
35 aspect of the invention and those provided below the twelfth aspect of the invention. The skilled
   person understands that any aspect of the invention may be combined with another aspect or
   aspects of the invention and/or with one or more (several) of the preferences for the aspects of
   the invention and/or other disclosures made herein.

   Polynucleotides
            A third aspect of the invention relates to isolated polynucleotides that encode any of the
   variants or fusion polypeptides of the invention. The polynucleotide may be an isolated
 5 polynucleotide. The polynucleotide may be comprised in a vector (such as a plasmid) and/or in
   a host cell.
            Further preferences for the third aspect of the invention include those of the first aspect
   of the invention and those provided below the twelfth aspect of the invention. The skilled person
   understands that any aspect of the invention may be combined with another aspect or aspects
 0 of the invention and/or with one or more (several) of the preferences for the aspects of the
   invention and/or other disclosures made herein.
   Nucleic Acid Constructs
            A fourth aspect of the invention relates to nucleic acid constructs comprising a
 5 polynucleotide encoding a variant or fusion polypeptide of the invention operably linked to one
   or more (several) control sequences that direct the expression of the coding sequence in a
   suitable host cell under conditions compatible with the control sequences.
            A polynucleotide may be manipulated in a variety of ways to provide for expression of a
   variant. Manipulation of the polynucleotide prior to its insertion into a vector may be desirable or
 o necessary depending on the expression vector. The techniques for modifying polynucleotides
   utilizing recombinant DNA methods are well known in the art.
            The control sequence may be a promoter sequence, which is recognized by a host cell
   for expression of the polynucleotide. The promoter sequence contains transcriptional control
   sequences that mediate the expression of the variant. The promoter may be any nucleic acid
a5 sequence that shows transcriptional activity in the host cell including mutant, truncated, and
   hybrid promoters, and may be obtained from genes encoding extracellular or intracellular
   polypeptides either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.
            In a yeast host, useful promoters are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae enolase (ENO-1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae protease A (PRA1), Saccharomyces
30 cerevisiae protease B (PRB1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae translation elongation factor (TEF1),
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae translation elongation factor (TEF2), Saccharomyces cerevisiae
   galactokinase (GAL1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde
   3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADHI1, ADH2/GAP), Saccharomyces cerevisiae triose phosphate
   isomerase (TPI), Saccharomyces cerevisiae metallothionein (CUP1), and Saccharomyces
35 cerevisiae 3-phosphoglycerate kinase. Other useful promoters for yeast host cells are described
   by Romanos et al., 1992, Yeast 8: 423-488.
            The skilled person knows useful promoters for use in rice and mammalian cells, such as
   CHO or HEK. In a rice host, useful promoters are obtained from cauliflower mosaic virus 35S
                                                     30

    RNA gene (CaMV35S), maize alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh1) and alpha Amy3.
            In a mammalian host cell, such as CHO or HEK, useful promoters are obtained from
    Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and CAG hybrid promoter (hybrid of CMV early enhancer element and
    chicken beta-actin promoter), Simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40).
  5         The control sequence may also be a suitable transcription terminator sequence, which is
    recognized by a host cell to terminate transcription. The terminator sequence is operably linked
    to the 3'-terminus of the polynucleotide encoding the variant. Any terminator that is functional in
    the host cell may be used.
            Preferred terminators for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for
  0 Saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome C (CYC1),
    Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae
    glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Other useful terminators for yeast host cells are
    described by Romanos et al., 1992, supra. The skilled person knows useful terminators for use
    in rice and mammalian cells, such as CHO or HEK. For example, in a rice host, preferred
  5 terminators are obtained from Agrobacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase (Nos) and
    cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA gene (CaMV35S).
            The control sequence may also be a suitable leader sequence, a nontranslated region of
    an mRNA that is important for translation by the host cell. The leader sequence is operably
    linked to the 5'-terminus of the polynucleotide encoding the variant. Any leader sequence that is
  O functional in the host cell may be used.
            Suitable leaders for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for Saccharomyces
    cerevisiae    enolase (ENO-1),       Saccharomyces      cerevisiae    3-phosphoglycerate    kinase,
    Saccharomyces cerevisiae           alpha-factor, and       Saccharomyces      cerevisiae    alcohol
    dehydrogenase/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ADH2/GAP).
a-5         The control sequence may also be a polyadenylation sequence, a sequence operably
    linked to the 3'-terminus of the variant-encoding sequence and, when transcribed, is recognized
    by the host cell as a signal to add polyadenosine residues to transcribed mRNA. Any
    polyadenylation sequence that is functional in the host cell may be used.
            Useful polyadenylation sequences for yeast host cells are described by Guo and
30  Sherman, 1995, Mol. Cellular Biol. 15: 5983-5990.
            The control sequence may also be a signal peptide coding region that encodes a signal
    peptide linked to the N-terminus of a variant and directs the variant into the cell's secretory
    pathway. The 5'-end of the coding sequence of the polynucleotide may inherently contain a
    signal peptide coding region naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the
35  coding region that encodes the variant. Alternatively, the 5'-end of the coding sequence may
    contain a signal peptide coding region that is foreign to the coding sequence. The foreign signal
    peptide coding region may be required where the coding sequence does not naturally contain a
    signal peptide coding region. Alternatively, the foreign signal peptide coding region may simply
                                                     31

    replace the natural signal peptide coding region in order to enhance secretion of the variant.
    However, any signal peptide coding region that directs the expressed variant into the secretory
    pathway of a host cell may be used.
             Useful signal peptides for yeast host cells are obtained from the genes for
  5 Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha-factor and Saccharomyces cerevisiae invertase. Other useful
    signal peptide coding sequences are described by Romanos et al., 1992, supra. The skilled
    person knows useful signal peptides for use in rice and mammalian cells, such as CHO or HEK.
            Where both signal peptide and propeptide regions are present at the N-terminus of a
    variant, the propeptide region is positioned next to the N-terminus of the variant and the signal
  0 peptide region is positioned next to the N-terminus of the propeptide region.
             Further preferences for the fourth aspect of the invention include those of the first aspect
    of the invention and those provided below the twelfth aspect of the invention. The skilled person
    understands that any aspect of the invention may be combined with another aspect or aspects
    of the invention and/or with one or more (several) of the preferences for the aspects of the
  5 invention and/or other disclosures made herein.
    Preparation of Variants
            A fifth aspect of the invention relates to a method for preparing or obtaining a variant
    albumin or fragment thereof, or fusion polypeptides comprising the variant albumin or fragments
  o thereof, or associates of variant albumin or fragment thereof comprising:
            (a) introducing into a parent albumin or fragments thereof, or fusion polypeptides
    comprising the parent albumin or fragments thereof an alteration at two or more positions
    selected from 492, 550, 573, 574 and 580, preferably as described for the first aspect of the
    invention; and
a-5         (b) recovering the variant albumin or fragment thereof, or fusion polypeptides comprising
    the variant albumin or fragment thereof.
             Preferred alterations are as described in relation to the first aspect of the invention. The
    resultant variant albumin or fragment thereof may have altered FcRn-binding affinity compared
    to the FcRn-binding affinity of a reference such as a parent albumin or fragment which does not
30  comprise the alterations. More preferably, the resultant variant albumin or fragment thereof has
    a stronger FcRn-binding affinity.
            The invention includes a method for preparing a polypeptide which is a variant of
    albumin, fragment thereof or fusion polypeptide comprising said variant albumin or fragment
    thereof having a binding affinity to FcRn which is altered compared to the binding affinity of a
35  reference albumin, fragment or fusion thereof to FcRn, comprising:
              (a) providing a nucleic acid encoding a parent albumin such as an albumin having at
    least 60% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 2;
            (b) modifying the sequence of step (a), to encode a polypeptide which is a variant
                                                     32

    albumin, fragment thereof or fusion polypeptide comprising said variant albumin or fragment
    thereof comprising alterations at two or more positions corresponding to positions selected from
    selected among two or more of the group consisting of positions 492, 550, 573, 574 and 580 in
    SEQ ID NO: 2;
  5          (c) optionally, introducing the modified sequence of step (b) in a suitable host cell;
             (d) optionally, growing the cells in a suitable growth medium under condition leading to
    expression of the polypeptide; and
             (e) optionally, recovering the polypeptide from the growth medium;
               wherein the polypeptide has an altered binding affinity to FcRn and/or an altered
  0 plasma half-life compared with the half-life of a parent albumin, reference albumin, fragment
    thereof or fusion polypeptide comprising said parent albumin, reference albumin or fragment or
    fusion thereof.
             It is preferred that the parent albumin and/or the variant albumin comprises or consists
  5 of:
             (a) a polypeptide having at least 60% sequence identity to the mature polypeptide of
    SEQ ID NO: 2;
             (b) a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes under low stringency
    conditions with (i) the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or (ii) the full
  O length complement of (i);
             (c) a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide having at least 60% identity to the mature
    polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1; and/or
             (d) a fragment of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2.
a-5          The variants can be prepared by those skilled persons using any mutagenesis
    procedure known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis, synthetic gene construction,
    semi-synthetic gene construction, random mutagenesis, shuffling, etc.
             Site-directed mutagenesis is a technique in which one or more (several) mutations
    (alterations) are created at one or more (several) defined sites in a polynucleotide encoding the
30  parent.
             Site-directed mutagenesis can be accomplished in vitro by PCR involving the use of
    oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation. Site-directed mutagenesis can also be
    performed in vitro by cassette mutagenesis involving the cleavage by a restriction enzyme at a
    site in the plasmid comprising a polynucleotide encoding the parent and subsequent ligation of
35  an oligonucleotide containing the mutation in the polynucleotide. Usually the restriction enzyme
    that digests at the plasmid and the oligonucleotide is the same, permitting ligation of the plasmid
    and insert to one another. See, e.g., Scherer and Davis, 1979, Proc. Nat/. Acad. Sci. USA 76:
    4949-4955; and Barton et al., 1990, Nucleic Acids Res. 18: 7349-4966.
                                                       33

           Site-directed mutagenesis can also be accomplished in vivo by methods known in the
   art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication NO: 2004/0171154; Storici et al., 2001,
   Nature Biotechnol. 19: 773-776; Kren et al., 1998, Nat. Med. 4: 285-290; and Calissano and
   Macino, 1996, Fungal Genet. Newslett. 43: 15-16.
 5         Any site-directed mutagenesis procedure can be used in the invention. There are many
   commercial kits available that can be used to prepare variants.
           Synthetic gene construction entails in vitro synthesis of a designed polynucleotide
   molecule to encode a polypeptide of interest. Gene synthesis can be performed utilizing a
   number of techniques, such as the multiplex microchip-based technology described by Tian et
 0 al. (2004, Nature 432: 1050-1054) and similar technologies wherein oligonucleotides are
   synthesized and assembled upon photo-programmable microfluidic chips.
           Single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions can be made and
   tested using known methods of mutagenesis, recombination, and/or shuffling, followed by a
   relevant screening procedure, such as those disclosed by Reidhaar-Olson and Sauer, 1988,
 5 Science 241: 53-57; Bowie and Sauer, 1989, Proc. Nat/. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 2152-2156;
   WO 95/17413; or WO 95/22625. Other methods that can be used include error-prone PCR,
   phage display (e.g., Lowman et al., 1991, Biochemistry 30: 10832-10837; U.S. Patent NO:
   5,223,409; WO 92/06204) and region-directed mutagenesis (Derbyshire et al., 1986, Gene 46:
   145; Ner et al., 1988, DNA 7: 127).
 O         Mutagenesis/shuffling methods can be combined with high-throughput, automated
   screening methods to detect activity of cloned, mutagenized polypeptides expressed by host
   cells (Ness et al., 1999, Nature Biotechnology 17: 893-896). Mutagenized DNA molecules that
   encode active polypeptides can be recovered from the host cells and rapidly sequenced using
   standard methods in the art. These methods allow the rapid determination of the importance of
a5 individual amino acid residues in a polypeptide.
           Semi-synthetic gene construction is accomplished by combining aspects of synthetic
   gene construction, and/or site-directed mutagenesis, and/or random mutagenesis, and/or
   shuffling. Semi-synthetic construction is typified by a process utilizing polynucleotide fragments
   that are synthesized, in combination with PCR techniques. Defined regions of genes may thus
30 be synthesized de novo, while other regions may be amplified using site-specific mutagenic
   primers, while yet other regions may be subjected to error-prone PCR or non-error prone PCR
   amplification. Polynucleotide sub sequences may then be shuffled.
           Further preferences for the fifth aspect of the invention include those of the first aspect of
   the invention and those provided below the twelfth aspect of the invention. The skilled person
35 understands that any aspect of the invention may be combined with another aspect or aspects
   of the invention and/or with one or more (several) of the preferences for the aspects of the
   invention and/or other disclosures made herein.

   Methods of Production
            A sixth aspect of the invention relates to methods of preparation of a variant according to
   the invention. The variants of the invention can be prepared using techniques well known to the
   skilled person. One convenient way is by cloning nucleic acid encoding the parent albumin or a
 5 fragment thereof or fusion polypeptide comprising albumin or a fragment thereof, modifying said
   nucleic acid to introduce the desired substitution(s) at two or more positions corresponding to
   positions selected from 492, 550, 573, 574 and 580 of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2
   (or equivalent positions in other albumins or fragments thereof), preferably as described for the
   first or fifth aspects of the invention, preparing a suitable genetic construct where the modified
 0 nucleic acid is placed in operative connection with suitable regulatory genetic elements, such as
   promoter, terminator, activation sites, ribosome binding sites etc., introducing the genetic
   construct into a suitable host organism, culturing the transformed host organism under
   conditions leading to expression of the variant and recovering the variant. All these techniques
   are known in the art and it is within the skills of the average practitioner to design a suitable
 5 method for preparing a particular variant according to the invention.
            The variant polypeptide of the invention may also be connected to a signal sequence in
   order to have the variant polypeptide secreted into the growth medium during culturing of the
   transformed host organism. It is generally advantageous to have the variant polypeptide
   secreted into the growth medium in order to ease recovery and purification.
 O          Techniques for preparing variant polypeptides have also been disclosed in WO
   2009019314 (included by reference) and these techniques may also be applied to the invention.
            Albumins have been successfully expressed as recombinant proteins in a range of hosts
   including fungi (including but not limited to Aspergillus (WO06066595), Kluyveromyces (Fleer
   1991, Bioltechnology 9, 968-975), Pichia (Kobayashi 1998 Therapeutic Apheresis 2, 257-262)
a5 and Saccharomyces (Sleep 1990, Bioltechnology 8, 42-46)), bacteria (Pandjaitab 2000, J.
   Allergy Clin. Immunol. 105, 279-285)), animals (Barash 1993, Transgenic Research 2, 266-276)
   and plants (including but not limited to potato and tobacco (Sijmons 1990, Bio/technology 8, 217
   and Farran 2002, Transgenic Research 11, 337-346) and rice e.g. Oryza sativa) and
   mammalian cells such as CHO and HEK. The variant polypeptide of the invention is preferably
30 produced recombinantly in a suitable host cell. In principle any host cell capable of producing a
   polypeptide in suitable amounts may be used and it is within the skills of the average
   practitioner to select a suitable host cell according to the invention. A preferred host organism is
   yeast, preferably selected among            Saccharomycacae,     more    preferred  Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae.
35          The variant polypeptides of the invention may be recovered and purified from the growth
   medium using a combination of known separation techniques such as filtration, centrifugation,
   chromatography, and affinity separation techniques etc. It is within the skills of the average
   practitioner to purify the variants of the invention using a particular combination of such known
                                                      35

   separation steps. As an example of purification techniques that may be applied to the variants
   of the invention can be mentioned the teaching of WO00/44772.
           The variant polypeptides of the invention may be used for delivering a therapeutically
   beneficial compound (including prophylactically beneficial compound such as a vaccine) to an
 5 animal or a human individual in need thereof. Such therapeutically beneficial compounds
   include, but are not limited, to labels and readily detectable compounds for use in diagnostics,
   such as various imaging techniques; pharmaceutical active compounds such as drugs, or
   specifically binding moieties such as antibodies. The variants of the invention may even be
   connected to two or more different therapeutically beneficial compounds, e.g., an antibody and
 0 a drug, which gives the combined molecule the ability to bind specifically to a desired target and
   thereby provide a high concentration of the connected drug at that particular target.
            Further preferences for the sixth aspect of the invention include those of the first aspect
   of the invention and those provided below the twelfth aspect of the invention. The skilled person
   understands that any aspect of the invention may be combined with another aspect or aspects
 5 of the invention and/or with one or more (several) of the preferences for the aspects of the
   invention and/or other disclosures made herein.
   Conjugates
           A seventh aspect of the invention relates to conjugates (conjugations).Therefore, the
 o variants of albumin or fragments thereof or fusion polypeptides according to the invention may
   be conjugated to a second molecule ('conjugation partner') using techniques known within the
   art. The conjugation partner may be a therapeutic, prophylactic (including vaccine), diagnostic,
   imaging or other beneficial moiety. Said conjugation partner may be a polypeptide or a non
   polypeptide chemical. The conjugation partner may be a polypeptide, chemical (e.g. chemically
a5 synthesised drug) or a nucleic acid (e.g. DNA, RNA, siRNA).
           Said second molecule may comprise a diagnostic or imaging moiety, and in this
   embodiment the conjugate may be useful as a diagnostic tool such as in imaging; or the second
   molecule may be a therapeutic or prophylactic (e.g. vaccine) compound and in this embodiment
   the conjugate may be used for therapeutic or prophylactic (e.g. vaccination) purposes where the
30 conjugate will have the therapeutic or prophylactic properties of the therapeutic or prophylactic
   compound as well as the desirable plasma half-life provided by the albumin part of the
   conjugate. Conjugates of albumin and a therapeutic molecule are known in the art and it has
   been verified that such conjugates have long plasma half-life compared with the non
   conjugated, free therapeutic molecule as such. According to the invention it is possible to alter
35 the binding affinity to FcRn and/or plasma half-life of the conjugate according to the invention
   compared to the corresponding conjugates of the prior art. 'Alter' includes both increasing the
   plasma half-life and decreasing the plasma half-life binding affinity to FcRn and/or increasing
   the binding affinity and decreasing the binding affinity to FcRn. Increasing the plasma half-life
                                                   36

   and/or binding affinity to FcRn is preferred. The conjugates may conveniently be linked via a
   free thiol group present on the surface of HSA (amino acid residue 34 of mature HSA) using
   well known chemistry.
            In one particular preferred aspect the variant albumin or fragment thereof is conjugated
 5 to a beneficial therapeutic or prophylactic (including vaccine) compound and the conjugate is
   used for treatment of a condition in a patient in need thereof, which condition is responsive to
   the particular selected therapeutic compound. Techniques for conjugating such a therapeutically
   useful compound to the variant albumin or fragment thereof are known in the art. WO
   2009/019314 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) discloses examples of techniques
 0 suitable for conjugating a therapeutically compound to a polypeptide which techniques can also
   be applied to the invention. Further WO 2009/019314 discloses examples of compounds and
   moieties that may be conjugated to substituted transferrin and these examples may also be
   applied to the invention. The teaching of WO 2009/019314 is included herein by reference.
            HSA contains in its natural form one free thiol group (at Cys34) that conveniently may be
 5 used for conjugation. As a particular embodiment within this aspect the variant albumin or
   fragment thereof may comprise further modifications provided to generate additional free thiol
   groups on the surface. This has the benefit that the payload of the variant albumin or fragment
   thereof is increased so that more than one molecule of the therapeutic (e.g. prophylactic)
   compound can be conjugated to each molecule of variant albumin or fragment thereof, or two or
 0 more (several) different therapeutic compounds may be conjugated to each molecule of variant
   albumin or fragment thereof, e.g., a compound having targeting properties such as an antibody
   specific for example a tumour; and a cytotoxic drug conjugated to the variant albumin or
   fragment thereof thereby creating a highly specific drug against a tumour. Teaching of particular
   residues that may be modified to provide for further free thiol groups on the surface can be
a5 found in co-pending patent application WO 2010/092135, which is incorporated by reference.
       The conjugation partner may alternatively be conjugated to a fusion polypeptide (described
   herein), resulting in a molecule comprising a fusion partner fused to the albumin as well as a
   conjugation partner conjugated to the same albumin or even to the fusion partner.
            Further preferences for the seventh aspect of the invention include those of the first
30 aspect of the invention and those provided below the twelfth aspect of the invention. The skilled
   person understands that any aspect of the invention may be combined with another aspect or
   aspects of the invention and/or with one or more (several) of the preferences for the aspects of
   the invention and/or other disclosures made herein.
35 Associates
            An eighth aspect of the invention relates to associates. Therefore, the variants of
   albumin or fragments thereof or fusion polypeptides may further be used in form of "associates".
   In this connection the term "associate" is intended to mean a compound comprising a variant of
                                                    37

   albumin or a fragment thereof and another compound bound or associated to the variant
   albumin or fragment thereof by non-covalent binding. As an example of such an associate can
   be mentioned an associate consisting of variant albumin and a lipid associated to albumin by a
   hydrophobic interaction. Such associates are known in the art and they may be prepared using
 5 well known techniques. As an example of a preferred associate according to the invention can
   be mentioned, an associate comprising variant albumin and a taxane, a taxol or taxol derivative
   (e.g. paclitaxel). Further examples of associates comprise a therapeutic, prophylactic (including
   vaccine), diagnostic, imaging or other beneficial moiety.
            The half-life of an albumin associate according to the invention may be longer or shorter
 0 than the half-life of the 'other compound' alone. The half-life of an albumin associate according
   to the invention may be longer or shorter than the half-life of the analogous / equivalent albumin
   associate comprising or consisting of a reference albumin such as native HSA (instead of an
   albumin variant or derivative according to the invention) and the 'other compound'. Likewise, the
   binding affinity to FcRn of an albumin associate according to the invention may be stronger or
 5 weaker than the binding affinity to FcRn of the analogous / equivalent albumin associate
   comprising or consisting of a reference albumin such as native HSA (instead of an albumin
   variant or derivative according to the invention) and the 'other compound'. Methods for the
   preparation of associates are well-known to the skilled person, for example, formulation (by
   association) of HSA with Lipo-compounds is described in Hussain, R. and Siligardi, G. (2006)
 O International Journal of Peptide Research and Therapeutics, Vol. 12, NO: 3, pp. 311-315.
            Further preferences for the eighth aspect of the invention include those of the first aspect
   of the invention and those provided below the twelfth aspect of the invention. The skilled person
   understands that any aspect of the invention may be combined with another aspect or aspects
   of the invention and/or with one or more (several) of the preferences for the aspects of the
a5 invention and/or other disclosures made herein.
   Compositions
            A ninth aspect of the invention relates to compositions. Therefore the invention is also
   directed to the use of a variant of albumin or a fragment thereof or fusion polypeptides
30 comprising variant albumin or fragments thereof, or a conjugate comprising a variant of albumin
   or a fragment thereof, or an associate comprising a variant of albumin or a fragment thereof for
   the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition, wherein the variant of albumin or a fragment
   thereof or fusion polypeptides comprising variant albumin or fragments thereof, or a conjugate
   comprising a variant of albumin or a fragment thereof, or an associate comprising a variant of
35 albumin or a fragment thereof has an altered binding affinity to FcRn and/or an altered plasma
   half-life compared with HSA or the corresponding fragment thereof or fusion polypeptide
   comprising HSA or fragment thereof or conjugate comprising HSA.
            In this connection the corresponding fragment of HSA is intended to mean a fragment of
                                                    38

   HSA that aligns with and has same number of amino acids as the fragment of the variant
   albumin with which it is compared. Similarly the corresponding fusion polypeptide comprising
   HSA or conjugate comprising HSA is intended to mean molecules having same size and amino
   acid sequence as the fusion polypeptide of conjugate comprising variant albumin, with which it
 5 is compared.
           The composition may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient such
   as water, polysorbate 80 or those specified in the US Pharmacopoeia for human albumin.
            Further preferences for the ninth aspect of the invention include those of the first aspect
   of the invention and those provided below the twelfth aspect of the invention. The skilled person
 0 understands that any aspect of the invention may be combined with another aspect or aspects
   of the invention and/or with one or more (several) of the preferences for the aspects of the
   invention and/or other disclosures made herein.
 5 Nanoparticles
           A tenth aspect of the invention relates to a nanoparticle comprising a variant, fusion,
   conjugate, associate, nanoparticle, composition or polynucleotide as disclosed herein.
           Techniques for incorporation of a molecule into nano- or microparticles are known in the
   art. Preferred methods for preparing nano- or microparticles that may be applied to the albumin,
 0 variant, fragment, fusion, conjugate or associate thereof according to the invention is disclosed
   in WO 2004/071536 or W02008/007146 or Oner & Groves (Pharmaceutical Research, Vol
   10(9), 1993, pages 1387 to 1388) which are incorporated herein by reference. Preferably the
   average diameter of a nano-particle is from 5 to 1000 nm, more preferably 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
   80, 100, 130, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, or 999 to 5,10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80,
a5 100, 130, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, or 1000 nm. An advantage of a
   microparticle less than 200 nm diameter, and more particularly less than 130 nm, is that is
   amenable to sterilisation by filtration through a 0.2 pm (micron) filter. Preferably, the average
   diameter of a micro-particle is from 1000 nm (1 pm (micron)) to 100 pm (micron), more
   preferably from 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 to 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60,
30 70, 80, 90, 100 pm (micron).
            Further preferences for the tenth aspect of the invention include those of the first aspect
   of the invention and those provided below the twelfth aspect of the invention. The skilled person
   understands that any aspect of the invention may be combined with another aspect or aspects
   of the invention and/or with one or more (several) of the preferences for the aspects of the
35 invention and/or other disclosures made herein.
   Uses
           An eleventh aspect of the invention relates to use of a variant albumin, fragment, fusion
                                                    39

   or conjugate thereof or nanoparticle or associate thereof. Use may be, for example, in a method
   of treatment, prophylaxis, diagnosis or imaging. The variant albumin or fragments thereof or
   fusion polypeptides comprising variant albumin or fragments thereof according to the invention
   have the benefit that their binding affinity to FcRn and/or plasma half-life is altered compared to
 5 the parent or reference albumin or fragments thereof or fusion polypeptides comprising parent
   or reference albumin or fragments thereof. This has the advantage that the binding affinity to
   FcRn and/or plasma half-life of conjugates comprising variant albumin or a fragment thereof or
   fusion polypeptide comprising variant albumin or a fragment thereof, or an associate comprising
   variant albumin or a fragment thereof according to the invention can be selected in accordance
 0 with the particular therapeutic purpose.
            In some situations, it would be advantageous to use an albumin, variant, fragment,
   fusion, conjugate or associate or composition thereof having a longer plasma half-life than the
   reference molecule or composition since this would have the benefit that the administration of
   the albumin, variant, fragment, fusion, conjugate or associate or composition thereof would be
 5 needed less frequently or at a reduced dose (and consequently with fewer side effects)
   compared to the situation where the reference molecule or composition was used. With respect
   to the use of a variant, fusion, conjugate, associate, nanoparticle, composition or polynucleotide
   the albumin moiety may comprise one more alterations as disclosed herein.
            In other situations, it would be advantageous to use an albumin, variant, fragment,
 o fusion, conjugate or associate or composition thereof having a shorter plasma half-life than the
   reference molecule or composition since this would have the benefit that the administration of
   the albumin, variant, fragment, fusion, conjugate or associate or composition thereof can be
   carried out at a higher dose compared to the situation where the reference molecule or
   composition was used with the benefit that the administered compound clears from the recipient
e5 more quickly than if the reference molecule or composition was used. With respect to the use of
   a variant, fusion, conjugate, associate, nanoparticle, composition or polynucleotide the albumin
   moiety may comprise one more alterations as disclosed herein.
            For example for a conjugate, associate or fusion polypeptide used for imaging purposes
   in animals or human beings, where the imaging moiety has an very short half-life and a
30 conjugate or a fusion polypeptide comprising HSA has a plasma half-life that is far longer than
   needed for the imaging purposes it would be advantageous to use a variant albumin or
   fragment thereof of the invention having a shorter plasma half-life than the parent or reference
   albumin or fragment thereof, to provide conjugates of fusion polypeptides having a plasma half
   life that is sufficiently long for the imaging purpose but sufficiently short to be cleared form the
35 body of the particular patient on which it is applied.
            In another example for a conjugate, an associate or fusion polypeptide comprising a
   therapeutic compound effective to treat or alleviate a particular condition in a patient in need for
   such a treatment it would be advantageous to use the variant albumin or fragment thereof
                                                     40

   having a longer plasma half-life than the parent or reference albumin or fragment thereof, to
   provide associates or conjugates or fusion polypeptides having longer plasma half-lives which
   would have the benefit that the administration of the associate or conjugate or fusion
   polypeptide of the invention would be needed less frequently or at reduced dose with less side
 5 effects compared to the situation where the parent or reference albumin or associates thereof or
   fragment thereof was used. For example, the invention provides a method of treating a
   proliferative disease in an individual, comprising administering the individual an effective
   amount of an associate according to the invention in which the associate comprises a taxane, a
   taxol or taxol derivative (e.g. paclitaxel).
 O         In a further aspect the invention relates to compositions comprising the variant albumin,
   associates thereof or fragment thereof, variant albumin fragment or associates thereof or fusion
   polypeptide comprising variant albumin or fragment thereof according to the invention. The
   compositions are preferably pharmaceutical compositions. The composition may be prepared
   using techniques known in the area such as disclosed in recognized handbooks within the
 5 pharmaceutical field. Since the albumin, variant, fragment, fusion, conjugate or associate
   thereof has a binding affinity to FcRn and/or plasma half-life which is modulated (i.e. stronger or
   weaker and/or longer or shorter) than that of a reference molecule, the composition also has a
   binding affinity to FcRn and/or modulated plasma half-life relative to an equivalent composition
   comprising the reference molecule in place of the albumin, variant, fragment, fusion, conjugate
 o or associate thereof as described herein. The composition may be a vaccine. The polypeptide
   according to the invention may be an active pharmaceutical or an excipient. Optionally, the
   composition is provided in unit dosage form.
           Preferably the albumin, variant, fragment, fusion, conjugate or associate thereof has a
   plasma half-life that is longer than the plasma half-life of the reference molecule e.g. the same
a5 composition except that the albumin component (e.g. albumin, variant, fragment, fusion,
   conjugate or associate) is wild-type albumin (e.g. HSA) or a variant, fragment, fusion, conjugate
   or associate.
           In a particular embodiment the compositions comprise a variant albumin or a fragment
   thereof according to the invention and a compound comprising a pharmaceutically beneficial
30 moiety and an albumin binding domain (ABD). According to the invention ABD means a site,
   moiety or domain capable of binding to circulating albumin in vivo and thereby conferring
   transport in the circulation of the ABD and any compound or moiety bound to said ABD. ABD's
   are known in the art and have been shown to bind very tight to albumin so a compound
   comprising an ABD bound to albumin will to a certain extent behave as a single molecule. The
35 inventors have realized by using the variant albumin or fragment thereof according to the
   invention together with a compound comprising a pharmaceutically beneficial moiety and an
   ABD makes it possible to alter the binding affinity to FcRn and/or plasma half-life of the
   compound comprising a pharmaceutically beneficial moiety and an ABD compared to the
                                                    41

   situation where said compound were injected as such in a patient having need thereof or
   administered in a formulation comprising natural albumin or a fragment thereof.
            The variant albumin or fragments thereof, conjugates comprising variant albumin or a
   fragment thereof or fusion polypeptide comprising variant albumin or a fragment thereof, or an
 5 associate comprising variant albumin or a fragment thereof according to the invention may also
   be incorporated into nano- or microparticles using techniques well known within the art. A
   preferred method for preparing nano- or microparticles that may be applied to the variant
   albumins or fragments thereof according to the invention is disclosed in WO 2004/071536 or
   W02008/007146 or Oner & Groves (Pharmaceutical Research, Vol 10(9), 1993, pages 1387 to
 0 1388) which are incorporated herein by reference.
            Further preferences for the eleventh aspect of the invention include those of the first
   aspect of the invention and those provided below the twelfth aspect of the invention. The skilled
   person understands that any aspect of the invention may be combined with another aspect or
   aspects of the invention and/or with one or more (several) of the preferences for the aspects of
 5 the invention and/or other disclosures made herein.
   Method for altering the FcRn-binding affinity or half-life of a molecule
            A twelfth aspect of the invention provides a method for altering the FcRn-binding affinity
   or half-life of a molecule comprising:
 0          (a) where the molecule is a polypeptide, fusing or conjugating the molecule to a
   polypeptide disclosed herein or to a conjugate disclosed herein; associating the molecule to a
   polypeptide disclosed herein or to a conjugate disclosed herein; incorporating the molecule in a
   nanoparticle disclosed herein or a composition disclosed herein;
            (b) where the molecule is not a polypeptide, conjugating the molecule to a polypeptide
a5 disclosed herein or to a conjugate disclosed herein; associating the molecule to a polypeptide
   disclosed herein or to a conjugate a disclosed herein; incorporating the molecule in a
   nanoparticle disclosed herein or a composition disclosed herein.
            Examples of 'molecule' include those useful in therapy, prophylaxis (including those
   used in vaccines either as an active pharmaceutical ingredient or as an excipient), imaging and
30 diagnosis, such as those described herein.
            Further preferences for the twelfth aspect of the invention include those of the first
   aspect of the invention and those provided below this twelfth aspect of the invention. The skilled
   person understands that any aspect of the invention may be combined with another aspect or
   aspects of the invention and/or with one or more (several) of the preferences for the aspects of
35 the invention and/or other disclosures made herein.
            Preferences for all aspects of the invention are provided below. The skilled person
   understands that any aspect of the invention may be combined with another aspect or aspects
                                                    42

   of the invention and/or with one or more (several) of the preferences for the aspects of the
   invention and/or other disclosures made herein.
           The variant of albumin or a fragment thereof or fusion polypeptides comprising variant
   albumin or fragments thereof, fragment thereof, conjugate, nanoparticle, associate or
 5 composition may have a plasma half-life that is either longer or shorter, preferably longer, than
   the plasma half-life than a corresponding albumin or a fragment thereof or fusion polypeptides
   comprising albumin or fragments thereof, fragment thereof, conjugate, nanoparticle, associate
   or composition or a binding to FcRn that is stronger or weaker, preferably weaker. Preferably
   the variant of albumin or a fragment thereof or fusion polypeptides comprising variant albumin or
 0 fragments thereof, fragment thereof, conjugate, nanoparticle, associate or composition has a
   plasma half-life that is longer than the plasma half-life of HSA or the corresponding albumin or a
   fragment thereof or fusion polypeptides comprising albumin or fragments thereof, fragment
   thereof, conjugate, nanoparticle, associate or composition.
           Alternatively, this may be expressed as the variant of albumin or a fragment thereof or
 5 fusion polypeptides comprising variant albumin or fragments thereof, fragment thereof,
   conjugate, nanoparticle, associate or composition having a KD to FcRn (e.g. shFcRn) that is
   lower than the corresponding KD for HSA to FcRn or the corresponding fragment thereof or
   fusion polypeptide comprising HSA or fragment thereof. Preferably, the KD for the variant of
   albumin or a fragment thereof or fusion polypeptides comprising variant albumin or fragments
 o thereof, fragment thereof, conjugate, nanoparticle, associate or composition is less than 0.9X
   KD for HSA to FcRn, more preferred less than 0.5X KD for HSA to FcRn, more preferred less
   than 0.1X KD for HSA to FcRn, even more preferred less than 0.05X KD for HSA to FcRn, even
   more preferred less than 0.02X KD for HSA to FcRn and most preferred less than 0.01X KD for
   HSA to FcRn (where X means 'multiplied by'). The KD of the variant of albumin or a fragment
a5 thereof or fusion polypeptides comprising variant albumin or fragments thereof, fragment
   thereof, conjugate, nanoparticle, associate or composition may be between the KD of WT
   albumin (e.g. SEQ ID No. 2) for FcRn and the KD of HSA K573P (SEQ ID No. 3) for FcRn. Such
   KDs represent binding affinities that are higher than the binding affinity between HSA and FcRn.
   A higher binding affinity indicates a longer half-life, for example plasma half-life.
30         Alternatively, the variant of albumin or a fragment thereof or fusion polypeptides
   comprising variant albumin or fragments thereof, fragment thereof, conjugate, nanoparticle,
   associate or composition has a plasma half-life that is shorter than the plasma half-life of HSA
   or the corresponding fragment thereof or fusion polypeptide comprising HSA or fragment
   thereof.
35         This may be expressed as the variant of albumin or a fragment thereof or fusion
   polypeptides comprising variant albumin or fragments thereof, fragment thereof, conjugate,
   nanoparticle, associate or composition having a KD to FcRn that is higher than the
   corresponding KD for HSA to FcRn or the corresponding of albumin or a fragment thereof or
                                                     43

    fusion polypeptides comprising albumin or fragments thereof, fragment thereof, conjugate,
    nanoparticle, associate or composition. Preferably, the KD for the variant of albumin or a
    fragment thereof or fusion polypeptides comprising variant albumin or fragments thereof,
    fragment thereof, or a conjugate comprising a variant of albumin or a fragment thereof is more
  5 than 2X KD for HSA to FcRn, more preferred more than 5X KD for HSA to FcRn, more preferred
    more than 1OX KD for HSA to FcRn, even more preferred more than 25X KD for HSA to FcRn,
    most preferred more than 50X KD, more than 60X, more than 70X KD, more than 80X, more
    than 90X or more than 1OOX KD for HSA to FcRn. The variant of albumin or a fragment thereof
    or fusion polypeptides comprising variant albumin or fragments thereof, fragment thereof,
  0 conjugate, nanoparticle, associate or composition may be a null binder to FcRn.
            The variant of albumin or a fragment thereof or fusion polypeptides comprising variant
    albumin or fragments thereof, fragment thereof, or a conjugate or nanoparticle or associate or
    composition comprising a variant of albumin or a fragment thereof is preferably the variant of
    albumin or a fragment thereof or fusion polypeptides comprising variant albumin or fragments
  5 thereof, fragment thereof, or a conjugate or nanoparticle or associate or composition comprising
    a variant of albumin or a fragment thereof according to the invention. A lower binding affinity
    indicates a shorter half-life, for example plasma half-life.
            One advantage of the invention is that it allows the half-life of albumin, a variant of
    albumin or a fragment thereof or fusion polypeptides comprising variant albumin or fragments
  o thereof, fragment thereof, conjugate, nanoparticle, associate or composition to be tailored in
    order to achieve a binding affinity or half-life which meets the needs of the user.
            When determining and/or comparing KD, one or more (and preferably all) of the
    following parameters may be used:

35  Regeneration of the surfaces may be done using injections of HBS-EP buffer (0.01 M HEPES,
    0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20) at pH 7.4 (Biacore AB).

  5         The invention discloses that two or more positions selected among the group consisting
    of positions 492, 550, 573, 574 and 580 in SEQ ID NO: 2 (and therefore equivalent positions in
    albumins and fragments from human serum and albumin and non-human serum albumins) may
    be altered in order to modulate (increase of decrease) the binding affinity and/or half-life e.g.
    plasma half-life of an albumin, fragment, fusion, conjugate, associate, nanoparticle or
  0 composition. An alteration may be a substitution, insertion or deletion. Substitution is preferred.
            A substitution or insertion may or may not comprise introduction of a conserved amino
    acid, i.e. conserved in relation to the amino acid at the position of interest. Examples of

 0           It is preferred that the alteration at position 492 is conserved relative to D or E. It is
   preferred that the alteration at position 574 is conserved relative to H. It is preferred that the
   alteration at position 580 is conserved relative to K.
            Advantageously, the polypeptide retains substantially the same tertiary structure (or, for
   a fragment, the relevant part of the structure) as a reference or parent albumin such as HSA.
 5 The skilled person understand the term 'substantially the same tertiary structure' bearing in
   mind that some degree of variation in tertiary structure is expected as all proteins have some
   degree of structural flexibility. This applies particularly to polypeptides having a higher binding
   affinity to FcRn than the parent or reference albumin (e.g. HSA) has to FcRn.
            One or more (several) of the His residues may or may not be maintained relative to the
 0 parent albumin. For example, with reference to SEQ ID NO: 2, one or more (several) of the
   following His residues may be maintained: 3, 9, 39, 67, 105, 128, 146, 242, 247, 288, 338, 367,
   440, 464, 510, 535. One or more (several), preferably all, of the His residues in domain I are
   maintained (i.e. 3, 9, 39, 67, 105, 128, 146.). One or more (several), preferably all, of the His
   residues in domain || are maintained (i.e. 242, 247, 288, 338, 367). One or more (several),
a5 preferably all, of the His residues in domain Ill are maintained (i.e. 440, 464, 510, 535). One or
   more (several) or all three of His 464, 510, 535 may be maintained.
             It is preferred that at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 or 17 of the
   disulphide bonds of the albumin are maintained in the polypeptide. For a polypeptide derived
   from a full length albumin, it is preferred that all disulphide bonds usually present in that albumin
30 are maintained. For a polypeptide derived from a fragment of albumin, it is preferred that all
   disulphide bonds usually present in that fragment are maintained. It is preferred that Cys34 (or
   equivalent in non-human albumins) is maintained.
             For all aspects of the invention fusion partner polypeptides and/or conjugates may
35 comprise one or more (several) of: 4-1 BB ligand, 5-helix, A human C-C chemokine, A human

           The invention is further described by the following examples that should not be
   construed as limiting the scope of the invention.
   Examples
 O Example 1. Preparation of HSA variant expression plasmids for HSA
           HSA variants were expressed using standard molecular biology techniques, such as
   described in Sambrook, J. and D.W. Russell, 2001 (Molecular Cloning: a laboratory manual, 3 rd
   ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y).
   Method 1: Permutation libraries at positions E492, D550, K574H and Q580K were produced by
-5 PCR amplification of pDB4081, encoding wild type HSA (described below), using a mutagenic
   forward primer and non-mutagenic reverse primer as shown in Table 2. The PCR conditions are
   shown in Tables 3 and 4. 2 pl of reaction product was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis
   and the remainder treated with 5pl of 1Ox buffer 4 (New England Biolabs - 50mM potassium
   acetate, 20mM Tris-acetate, 10mM magnesium acetate, 1mM DTT pH 7.9 at 25'C) and 1pl
30 Dpnl (NEB) for 1 hour at 370 C. The reactions were purified by addition of 50 pl water, prior to
   application of a vacuum for 20 minutes. A further 50 pl of water was added and a vacuum
   applied until the well was dry. Plasmid DNA was recovered by addition of 30 pl of water and
   incubation for 1 minute. 2 pl of this purified product was transformed into 15 pl TOP10 E. coli
   cells by standard protocols. Clones were selected and grown overnight in LB supplemented with
35 100 pg/ml ampicillin and purified using a Qiagen QlAprep 96 miniprep kit according to
   manufacturer's instructions. Variants were verified by sequencing.
           pDB4081 was made by the ligation of a synthetic DNA fragment, Bsal/Sphl digested,
   which had been generated by gene assembly (DNA2.0 Inc, USA), containing 3' region of the
                                                    69

  PRB1 promoter, modified fusion leader sequence, nucleotide sequence encoding HSA and 5'
  region of the modified ADH1 terminator) into Hindlll/Sphl-digested pDB4005. pDB4005 is
  described in WO 2011/051489 (incorporated herein by reference).

           Preparation of expression plasmids and transformation of S. cerevisiae was performed
   as described in W02012/150319 (incorporated herein by reference), employing the 24
   (pDB5027-9, pDB5032 and pDB5091-92), or 48 hour stocking method (all remaining variants).
   The host strain for pDB4990-5, pDB4997-5004, pDB5042-5046, pDB5027-32 and pDB5091-2
 0 was S. cerevisiae DYB7 (Payne et al (2008) Applied and Environmental Microbiology Vol
   74(24): 7759-7766) with four copies of PDI integrated into the genome. The host strain for the
   remaining plasmids was S. cerevisiae BXP10ciro as described in W02012/150319 (incorporated
   herein by reference). Protein isolation and purification from shake flask was performed as
   described in W02011/051489.

   Example 2. SPR analysis of binding affinity of WT HSA and variants to shFcRn
           SPR analyses were performed on a Biacore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare).
   Immobilisation was carried out on CM5 chips coupled with His-tagged shFcRn (FcRn produced
   by GeneArt, Life Technologies) using GE Healthcare amine coupling chemistry as per the
20 manufacturer's instructions. Immobilised levels of shFcRn-HIS (shFcRn with a 6-His tail on the
   C-terminus of beta-2-microglobulin) were 1200 - 2500RU and achieved by injecting 20pg/mL
   shFcRn diluted using sodium acetate pH4.5 (G E Healthcare). Chip surface was left to stabilize
   with a constant flow (5pL/min) of running buffer - Di-basic/Mono-basic phosphate buffer pH5.5
   ((67 mM phosphate buffer, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20) at pH 5.5)) at 25 0 C (i.e. ambient
                                                  75

  temperature) overnight. After ligand stabilization, the chip surface was conditioned by injecting
  5-12 x 45pL Di-basic/Mono-basic phosphate buffer at 30pL/min followed by HBSEP (0.01 M
  HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, 3mM EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20) at pH 7.4 (GE Healthcare))
  regeneration steps (12s) in between each injection. Surfaces were then checked for activity by
5 injecting 3x45pL positive control (wt HSA (SEQ ID NO: 2)) at 30pL/min, followed by 12s
  regeneration pulse. Kinetic measurements were performed by injecting dilutions (100pM
  0.01 6pM) of HSA and HSA variants at 30pL/min over immobilised shFcRn, at 250C (i.e. ambient
  temperature). The reference cell value was then subtracted and Biaevaluation software 4.1
  used to obtain kinetic data and confirm KD values.The variants were wild-type albumin (SEQ ID
0 NO: 2) and albumins with alterations at one or more of positions 492, 550, 573, 574 and 580.
  The variants were analysed by SPR to determine their binding response (RU) to shFcRn. Some
  variants were further characterized to determine KD values. The data are shown in Tables 12 to
  18.

   primers were used to introduce the desired changes, as listed in Table 20. The template
   plasmids were methylated using the components described in Table 21 , incubated at 370C for
   one hour and were then purified using a Qiagen QiaQuick PCR purification kit according to
   manufacturer's instructions. The methylated template was then used in mutagenic PCR

   40 pl of each of the PCR-generated plasmids was prepared for in vivo recombination by the
10 addition of 0.5 pl of each of Dpnl, Nsil and Pvul restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs),
   followed by incubation at 370C for one hour. 3 pl of the prepared plasmid, 3 pl of Acc651IBamHl
   digested pDB3936 and 1 pl of salmon sperm DNA were used to transform S. cerevisiae
   according to the protocol described in Example 1. The host strain used was a S. cerevisiae
   strain derived from DYB7 ura3 (Payne et al 2008, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 74(24): 7759-7766)
15 with two additional copies of PDI1 integrated into the genome. Single colonies were patched
   onto BMMD+CSM-leu plates (as described in WO 2012/150319, incorporated herein by
   reference) to enable assessment of expression prior to production of yeast stocks. Stocks were
                                                    83

   produced by the 48-hour method described in Example 1. 200 pl of each yeast strain was used
   to inoculate 10 ml BMMS in 50 ml shake flask, followed by incubation at 300C, 200 rpm for four
   days. Culture supernatant was harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes.
            Albumin variants were purified from 10mL shake flasks using a single chromatographic
 5 step with an albumin affinity matrix (AlbuPure T M - ProMetic BioSciences, Inc.). Micro-scale
   affinity chromatography was performed on an automated platform (Perkin Elmer, Janus) with
   200pL custom packed Atoll columns with 8 run in parallel in a 96-well format using the same
   procedure as described in WO 2011/051489 (incorporated herein by reference), with volumes
   scaled down appropriately.
 0          Final concentration of the samples was determined by Absorbance at 280nm using a UV
   microplate and a plate reader, readings were blank corrected against PBS and the
   concentrations calculated based on an extinction coefficient of 0.52AU/cm for a 1mg/mL
   solution (AU: absorbance units).
 5 Example 4. Analysis of further combination variants.
            Kinetic analyses using bio-layer interferometry were performed on an Octet Red-96
   instrument (ForteBio). Immobilisation of GST-tagged shFcRn (shFcRn-GST/FLAG) was carried
   out on AR2G biosensors using ForteBio amine coupling chemistry following the instructions
   from the manufacturer. shFcRn-GST/FLAG- refers to GST- tag (glutathione-transferase) and a
 0 FLAG-tag (DYKDDDDK) on the C-terminal of the alpha chain of FcRn. Prior to use, the
   GST/FLAG-tagged shFcRn was purified using IgG affinity chromatography. More specifically,
   the GST/FLAG-tagged shFcRn was captured on a GSTrap column and eluted with reduced
   glutathione. shFcRn was dialyzed into PBS into pH 7.4 and further purified using IgG
   Sepharose TM 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). The shFcRn was captured on the resin in 50mM Na
a5 acetate, 150mM NaCl pH 5.5 and eluted with PBS pH 7.4. The eluted shFcRn was
   concentrated to 2-5mg/mL and stored at -201C until use. Immobilised level of shFcRn
   GST/FLAG was at a response level more than 1nm, and achieved using a FcRn concentration
   of 2-10pg/mL in sodium acetate, followed by ethanolamine quenching of the amine coupling
   reaction. The sensors were either used directly or soaked in 15% (w/v) sucrose and dried until
30 use.
            Kinetic analyses were performed using micro-scale affinity purified albumin variants
   diluted 2-, 4- and 8-fold in BMMD fermentation media (as described WO 2011/051489,
   incorporated herein by reference) supplemented with 100mM sodium acetate and adjusted to
   pH 5.5. Association (120s) and dissociation (300s) were performed at 301C and shaking at
35 1000rpm. ForteBio software was used for data evaluation and calculation of KD values as well
   as association and dissociation constants which were calculated using the HSA concentrations
   determined by OD280nm measurement.
