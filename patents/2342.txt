                              DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   Example embodiments relate to methods of treating cancer. The methods
   include administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound to a
 5 patient. The compound is represented by Formula 1:
                    HO
                                          H
                               N-              NH2
                                       Formula 1.
   In one example embodiment, the cancer is associated with overexpression or
10 high expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5).
   PRMT belong to a class of nine enzymes that perform NG-mono methylation,
   asymmetric-, or symmetric- dimethylation of arginine residues on a range of
   nuclear and cytoplasmic protein substrates. PRMTs can be divided into three
15 subclasses, i.e. types 1,11and III. PRMT5 as type Il PRMTs, is responsible for
   catalyzing the symmetrical dimethylation of arginine residues within target
   proteins. PRMT5 is involved in diverse cellular and biological processes
   including transcriptional regulation, RNA metabolism and ribosome biogenesis.
   For example, PRMT5-driven methylation of arginine residues leads to
20 symmetric dimethylation of histone H4 (H4R3me2s), which in turn alters
   chromatin structure to promote transcriptional repression.
   PRMT5 plays a key role in the tumorigenesis, and is upregulated in
   lymphomas, breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer and glioblastoma.
25 A high cytoplasmic expression of PRMT5 is closely related to the high-grade
   subtypes of primary lung adenocarcinomas and a poor prognosis. PRMT5 can
   regulate multiple signaling pathways to promote lung cancer cell proliferation.
   Therefore, PRMT5 inhibitors are therapeutic agents for treating cancer.
                                           5

   An example embodiment provides a method to target PRMT5 mediated
   tumorigenesis in cancers with compound T1551 (i.e. compound of Formula I).
   Compound T1551 with indole scaffold inhibits PRMT5 methyltransferase
   activity. T1551 can decrease cell viability of A549 and H460 cells, reduce
 5 symmetric dimethylation level of H4R3, downregulate protein expression of
   two target genes of PRMT5, i.e. FGFR3 and eIF4E, and inhibit the activation
   of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK signaling.
   An example embodiment provides a method of treating cancer in a patient by
10 administering compound T1551 to the patient. In one example embodiment,
   tumor cells of the cancer express a higher level of PRMT5 than normal cells
   express. In one example embodiment, tumor cells of the cancer express a
   higher level of PRMT5 than healthy cells express. In one example
   embodiment, the cancer is selected from a group consisting of lymphomas,
15 breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, myeloma, ovarian cancer, and
   glioblastoma. In one example embodiment, the cancer is non-small cell lung
   cancer.
   In one     example   embodiment,    compound     T1551   is   administered   in
20 combination with one or more additional PRMT5 inhibitors to the patient.
   In one example embodiment, a patient is diagnosed as the patient with the
   cancer by determining an expression level of PRMT5. If the expression level
   of PRMT5 is higher than that of normal or healthy cells or tissues, the patient
   is diagnosed as the cancer that can be treated by compound T1 551.
   An example embodiment provides a method of treating a disease associated
   with overexpression of PRMT5. The disease associated with overexpression
   of PRMT5 relates to PRMT5-driven methylation of arginine residues which
   leads to symmetric dimethylation of histone H4 (H4R3me2s). Compound
   T1551 inhibits PRMT5-driven methylation of arginine residues and thereby
   ameliorate the progress of the disease associated with overexpression of
   PRMT5.
                                         6

In one example embodiment, the disease associated with overexpression of
PRMT5 includes but not limited to cancer and inflammation.
An example embodiment provides a pharmaceutical composition that includes
compound T1 551.
In one example embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is used to treat
cancer. In one example embodiment, tumor cells of the cancer express a
higher level of PRMT5 than normal cells do. In one example embodiment, the
cancer is selected from a group consisting of lymphomas, breast cancer, lung
cancer, colorectal cancer, myeloma, ovarian cancer, and glioblastoma. In one
example embodiment, the cancer is non-small cell lung cancer. In one
example embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is used to treat a
disease associated with overexpression of PRMT5.
In one example embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition includes one or
more additional      PRMT5      inhibitors.   In one example embodiment,       the
pharmaceutical composition includes a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient
or carrier. The pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier includes but
not limited to fillers (diluents), binders, disintegrating agents, lubricants, and
glidants.
In one example embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions can be
administered    by various routes, e.g., oral, subcutaneous, transdermal,
intramuscular, intravenous, or intraperitoneal. Routes of administering the
pharmaceutical composition include systematic delivery or local delivery to an
organ or tissue.
Example 1 Material and methods
1. MTT assay
Compound T1551 was purchased from Topscience company (Shanghai,
China), dissolved in DMSO and stored at -40 0C. A549 and H460 cells were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in environment
                                            7

of 5% C02 at 37oC in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100
units/mL penicillin and 100 pg/mL streptomycin. Cells were cultured in 96-cell
plates at a density of 3,000 cells/well overnight for cell adhesion. With the
treatment with DMSO or various concentrations of compound T1 551 for 72 hr,
each well was added 10 pL MTT (5 mg/mL) and incubated for 4 hr at 3oC,
followed by adding 100 pL acidic isopropanol (10% SDS and 0.01 mol/L HCI).
Finally, optical density (OD) of each well was measured at 570 nm by
Microplate Reader (Tecan, Morrisville, NC, USA).
2. PRMT5 methyltransferase activity assay
PRMT5 enzymatic assay was carried out by Shanghai ChemPartner Co. (998
Halei Road, Pudong New Area, Shanghai, 201203, China). 10 concentrations
of compound T1551 were tested to measure the IC5o values. T1551 was
prepared as 10 mM stock in DMSO and diluted to final concentration in
DMSO. PRMT5 and substrates were incubated with indicated concentrations
of compounds in a 384-well plate for 60 min at room temperature. Then,
acceptor and donor solutions were added to label the residual substrates of
PRMT5. The labeling process was lasting for 60 min at room temperature,
followed by reading endpoint with EnSpire with Alpha mode.
3. Western blot analysis
A549 and H460 cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer
supplemented with a protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific
78440, USA) for 30 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min (12,000 g,
40 C).  The supernatant was collected, and protein         concentration  was
calculated with a Bio-Rad DCTM protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Philadelphia, PA,
USA). 50 pg protein lysate were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane. Then,
membranes were incubated with primary antibody (1:1000), and with a
fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10000). GAPDH was used as
the loading control for normalization. The signal of membranes was scanned
with a LI-COR Odyssey Scanner (Belfast, ME, USA).
4. Molecular docking
                                       8

Molecular docking calculation was performed with Schrodinger software
(Schrodinger, Inc., New York, NY, 2015). Crystal complex of PRMT5, SAM
and EPZ015666 was derived from RCSB protein data bank (PDBID: 4X61).
After the preparation for protein with Prep Wiz in Maestro, a grid file was
generated based on the position of EPZ015666 for docking. Compound
T1551 was then preprocessed by LigPrep under OPLS-2005 force field, and
the low-energy three dimensional conformers were created. Finally, Glide with
the standard precision (SP) mode was used to dock compound T1551 into
PRMT5 binding pocket. The pose with the lowest docking score was chosen
for further binding mode analysis.
5. Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted using Graph Prim5.0 software. Descriptive
analytical data were presented as means ± SEM. Multiple comparisons were
evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) method. P<0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Example 2 Effect of compound T1551 in decreasing cell viability of NSCLC
cells
Figure 1A is a graph 100 showing the effect of compound T1551 on the cell
viability of A549 cells. Figure 1B is a graph 102 showing the effect of
compound T1 551 on the cell viability of H460 cells.
MTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of compound T1551 in
NSCLC cell lines, A549 and H460. A549 and H460 cells were incubated with
a range of compound T1551 concentrations (i.e. 0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 pM) for
72 hr. As shown in Figures 1A and 1B, compound T1551 significantly
decreased cell viability in A549 cells and H460 cells in a concentration
dependent manner.
Figure 1C is a table 104 showing the IC50 values of compound T1 551 in A549
and H460 cells. The IC5o values are 5.80 ±1.00 pM for A549 cells and 5.33
±1.48 pM for H460 cells, respectively.

   Example 3 Inhibition of compound T1 551 on PRMT5 methyltransferase
   activity
   Figure 2 is a graph 200 showing the inhibition of compound T1 551 on PRMT5.
 5 AlphaLISA assay was carried out to investigate the effect of compound T1 551
   on enzymatic activity of PRMT5. Figure 2 showed that compound T1551
   inhibited PRMT5 enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The
   corresponding IC50 value was 34.1 ± 2.8 pM, indicating that compound T1 551
   could directly inhibit the methyltransferase function of PRMT5.
   Example 4      Effect of compound T1551         in decreasing the symmetric
   dimethylation level of histone 4
   Figure 3 shows the western blot analysis 300 for histone 4 (H4) and
   H4R3me2s in A549 cells treated by compound T1 551.
   Since PRMT5-driven methylation of arginine residues can lead to symmetric
   dimethylation of arginine residue 3 of histone 4, the expression level of
   H4R3me2s protein in A549 cells treated with and without compound T1551
   was analyzed to investigate the effect of compound T1551 on PRMT5
   catalytic substrate. A549 cells were treated by different concentrations of
   compound T1551, i.e. 0, 5, 7.5 and 10 pM. The total H4 was used as loading
   control. As shown in Figure 3, after treating the cells with T1 551 for 24 hr, the
   global level of H4R3me2s is notably decreased. Therefore, from the
   perspective of histone substrate, it proves that compound T1551 can inhibit
   PRMT5 methyltransferase activity.
10 Example 5 Effect of compound T1551             on the down-regulation of the
   expression of PRMT5 target genes
   Figure 4 shows the western blot analysis 400 for the expression of target
   genes, i.e. FGFR3 and eIF4E.
15
                                            10

   PRMT5 exerts its function by regulating the expression of target genes, such
   as oncogene FGFR3 and eIF4E. FGFR3 and eIF4E were previously reported
   to frequently overexpress in cancer including lung cancer, myeloma and
   ovarian cancers, and thus the expression of FGFR3 and eIF4E plays an
 5 important role in tumor occurrence and development. The FGFR signaling has
   been targeted to treat cancer such as lung cancer. Using RNA interference
   technology, PRMT5 knockdown could down-regulate FGFR3 and eIF4E
   expression.
10 The protein expression levels of these two target genes FGFR3 and eIF4E in
   A549 cells treated with different concentrations of compound T1551 (i.e. 0,
   2.5, 5, and 10 pM) were analyzed to evaluate the relationship of PRMT5,
   compound T1551 and FGFR3/eIF4E. GAPDH was used as the loading
   control. As shown in Figure 4, FGFR3 and eIF4E expression significantly
15 decreased in A549 cells treated with 10 pM of compound T1 551. It shows that
   compound T1551 can reduce FGFR3 and eIF4E expression by inhibiting
   PRMT5.
   Example 6 Effect of compound T1551         in suppressing the activation of
   P13K/AKT/mTOR and ERK signaling in A549 cells
   Figure 5 shows the western blot analysis 500 for the expression of p-AKT,
   AKT, p-ERK, ERK, p-mTORT and mTORT in A549 cells treated with different
   concentrations of compound T1551 (i.e. 0, 2.5, 5 and 10 pM).
   eIF4E is a key event downstream of ras and P13K/AKT/mTOR signaling
   pathway, which is frequently activated in a diverse range of human cancers.
   FGFR3 is one of the receptors that promote cell survival by stimulating
   P13K/AKT/mTOR signaling, and can also activate AKT and ERK13. The effect
   of compound T1551 in the regulation of the activation of AKT, ERK and
   mTOR through inhibiting PRMT5 was examined to further analyze the
   molecular mechanism underlying PRMT5-dependent regulation of FGFR3. As
   shown in Figure 5, at the 10.0 pM of compound T1 551, the protein levels of
   phosphorylated AKT, ERK and mTOR in A549 cells significantly decreased,
                                         11

indicating that compound T1551 was able to suppress the activation of
P13K/AKT/mTOR and ERK signaling mediated by PRMT5.
Example 7 Interaction features of compound T1551 with PRMT5
Figure 6A shows the chemical structure 600 of compound T1551. Compound
T1551 has an indole scaffold represented as a blue structure in Figure 6A.
Figure 6B shows a crystal structure 602 of PRMT5-SAM-EPZ015666. Figure
6C is a drawing 604 showing the binding mode of PRMT5 with compound
T1551. Figure 6D is a drawing 606 showing the binding mode of PRMT5 with
EPZ015666. Compound T1551 binds to PRMT5 protein with the glide gscore
-9.33 kcal/mol. The interaction features of compound T1551             and co
crystalized EPZ015666 with PRMT5 were compared. The detailed binding
mode was shown in Figures 6B-6D. Similar to EPZ01 5666, T1551 buried in a
hydrophobic pocket composed of Tyr304, Phe327, Ser578 and Phe580 when
interacting with PRMT5 as shown in Figure 6C. The benzene ring of
compound T1 551 in indole scaffold formed strong cation--rr interaction with the
sulfur atom of SAM, as observed in PRMT5-EPZ015666 complex. In addition,
compound T1551 also formed a hydrogen bond with the main-chain oxygen
atom of Ser578, further fastening its interaction with PRMT5. The results
confirm that the compound T1551 is an inhibitor of PRMT5.
Figures 1-6 shows that compound T1551 with the indole scaffold was
identified as a PRMT5 inhibitor. Compound T1551 can not only decrease
cellular viability and symmetric demethylation level of histone 4 in A549 cells,
but also inhibit PRMT5 methyltransferase activity. Moreover, T1551 is able to
downregulate the protein expression of oncogene FGFR3/eIF4E via inhibiting
PRMT5, and then suppress the activation of P13K/AKT/mTOR and ERK
signaling. The key cation--rr interaction between the benzene ring of
compound T1551 and sulfur atom of SAM is responsible for its inhibitory
activity against PRMT5. The identification of this inhibitor and functional
biology study of PRMT5 contribute to the development of PRMT5 inhibitor for
the treatment of cancer.

   What is claimed is:
   1. A method of treating cancer in a patient, comprising:
           administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound to the
   patient to treat the cancer,
           wherein the compound is represented by Formula I,
                     HO
                                           H

                                   Formula I.
   2. The method of claim 1, wherein tumor cells of the cancer express a higher
   level of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) than normal cells
   express.
   3. The method of claim 1, wherein the cancer is selected from lymphomas,
   breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, myeloma, ovarian cancer, and
   glioblastoma.
   4. The method of claim 1, wherein the cancer is non-small cell lung cancer.
   5. The method of claim 1, wherein the compound is administered in
   combination with one or more (PRMT5) inhibitors.
 5
   6. The method of claim 1 further comprising:
           obtaining a biological sample from the patient;
           detecting whether PRMT5 is overexpressed in the biological sample by
   comparing a level of PRMT5 expression in the biological sample with a level
10 of PRMT5 expression in a control group; and
                                           16

          diagnosing the patient whose biological sample has higher level of the
   PRMT5 expression than that in the control group.
   7. The method of claim 6, wherein the biological sample is a tissue sample, a
 5 blood sample or a plasma sample from the patient.
   8. A method of treating a disease associated with overexpression of protein
   arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) in a patient, comprising:
          administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound to the
10 patient to treat the disease,
          wherein the compound is represented by Formula I:
                     HO
                                          H
                              N,               NH2
                                     Formula 1.
15 9. The method of claim 8, wherein the disease associated with
   overexpression of PRMT5 is cancer.
   10. The method of claim 9, wherein the cancer is selected from a group
   consisting of lymphomas, breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer,
20 myeloma, ovarian cancer, and glioblastoma.
   11. The method of claim 8, wherein the disease associated with
   overexpression of PRMT5 is non-small cell lung cancer.
25 12. The method of claim 8, wherein the compound is administered in
   combination with one or more (PRMT5) inhibitors.
   13. A pharmaceutical composition, comprising:
          a compound; and
          a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient,
                                          17

          wherein the compound is represented by Formula 1,
                    HO
                                         H
