[00011        This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/220,160, filed
June 24, 2009; U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/220,163, filed June 24, 2009; and U.S. Provisional
Application No. 61/232,362, filed August 7, 2009, all of which are incorporated by reference herein.
                                  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[00021        Delivery devices are used to deliver, or guide, medical devices or instruments to a target
location within a subject. The delivery devices provide access to target locations within the body where,
for example, diagnostic, therapeutic, and interventional procedures are required. Access via these devices
is generally minimally invasive, and can be either percutaneous, or through natural body orifices. The
access can require providing a guiding path through a body lumen, such as, for example without
limitation, a blood vessel, an esophagus, a trachea and adjoining bronchia, ducts, any portion of the gastro
intestinal tract, and the lymphatics. Once the delivery device has provided access to the target location,
the delivery device is then used to guide the medical device or instrument to perform the diagnostic,
therapeutic, or interventional procedure. An example of such a delivery device is a guide catheter, which
may be delivered by steering it to its required destination, tracking it along a previously delivered guide
wire, or both. The list of components being delivered for use percutaneously is large and rapidly
growing.
 100031       Minimal outer dimensions of these delivery devices are important for minimizing the injury
associated with delivery. Minimizing the wall thickness of the delivery device provides additional space
for the medical device to be guided, while minimizing the injury associated with entry into the subject and
the closure needed. Flexibility of the delivery device is important in allowing the guiding device to track
or be steered to its target destination along tortuous paths while minimizing injury to the intervening
tissues. The delivery device also needs to have compressive and tensile properties sufficient to support its
delivery to the target site. When tracking around bends in the body, any kinks created in the guiding
 device can create an obstruction to the delivery of the medical device. When used as a steerable device,
the distal end of the delivery device is preferably deflectable over a range of bend radii and responsive to
the steering controls. The delivery device also should support torque transmitted from the handle to the
 distal region.
 100041       Once the delivery device is in place the delivery device preferably also supports torque
 around a distal bend such that the medical device may be rotated into position while sustaining some
 contact loads. Additionally, once in place the guiding device preferably is sufficiently stiff to support and
 guide the medical device to its target destination. The guiding device should also remain stable and not
 shift from one state of equilibrium to another either spontaneously or under the influence of forces being
 imparted to it from the delivery of the medical device or its own control mechanisms. As the delivery

device often travels down fluid-filled lumens such as, for example without limitation, blood vessels, it
should additionally incorporate a seal against fluids impinging upon its periphery and another at its distal
end which interfaces with the medical device to maintain a seal around the delivery device.
[00051        There exists a need for improved steerable delivery devices and guiding medical devices.

  WO 2010/151698                                                                         PCT/US2010/039865

                           DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
 [00651       The disclosure relates generally to steerable delivery devices, which may be considered
steerable guide devices, and their methods of use. The steerable delivery devices can be used to deliver,
or guide, any type of suitable medical device or instrument therethrough to a location within a patient's
body. For example, the steerable delivery devices can be used to deliver, or guide, a medical device into
bodily lumens such as, for example without limitation, a blood vessel, an esophagus, a trachea and
possibly adjoining bronchia, any portion of the gastrointestinal tract, an abdominal cavity, a thoracic
cavity, various other ducts within the body, and the lymphatics. Once the steerable delivery device has
gained access to a target location within the subject, the medical device or instrument is delivered, or
guided, to the target location to carry out the medical intervention. Steerable delivery devices described
herein can be tracked along a previously delivered guide wire.
 [00661      Figure 1 is a perspective view of a distal portion of an exemplary steerable delivery device.
Steerable device 10 includes steerable portion 12 and has distal end 15. Steerable portion 12 includes an
outer tubular member 14 and inner tubular member 16. Outer tubular member 14 has an inner surface
defining a lumen therein, and inner tubular member 14 is sized to be disposed within the inner lumen of
outer tubular member 14. Outer tubular member 14 and inner tubular member 16 are axially fixed
relative to one another at fixation location 18 along the length of steerable device 10. That is, at fixation
location 18, the inner and outer tubular members are not adapted to move distally or proximally relative to
one another. Fixation location 18 is located distal to steerable portion 12. At locations proximal to
fixation location 18, inner tubular member 16 and outer tubular member 14 are axially movable relative to
one another. That is, along steerable portion 12, inner tubular member 16 and outer tubular member 14
are adapted to move axially relative to another. Outer tubular member 14 has slots 22 formed therein to
define spine 20. Spine 20 extends along a length of steerable portion 12. Slots 22 are shown substantially
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis "L" of steerable portion 12, when steerable portion 12 is in a
straightened configuration as shown in Figure 1. Inner tubular member 16 also has slots formed therein
(not shown) in the steerable portion to define a spine (not shown).
[0067]       Figures 2a and 2b illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a steerable delivery device.
Steerable device 30 has a distal end 37 and includes outer tubular element 34 and inner tubular element 36
which are axially immovable relative to one another at fixation location 38, but are axially movable
proximal to fixation location 38. Outer tubular element 34 includes a plurality of slots 42 formed therein
to define spine 40. Inner tubular element 36 also includes a plurality of slots formed therein (not shown)
to define a spine (not shown). In Figures 2a and 2b, the spines are disposed substantially 180 degrees
                                                       6

   WO 2010/151698                                                                      PCT/US2010/039865
apart from one another. Figure 2a illustrates steerable portion 32 deflected, or steered, into a first bent
configuration, while Figure 2b illustrates steerable portion 32 steered into a second bent configuration
different than the first bent configuration. To steer the steerable portion into the configuration shown in
Figure 2a, a proximal portion of outer tubular member 34 is moved axially, and specifically proximally,
relative to inner tubular member 36, while the tubular elements 34 and 36 are axially fixed relative to one
another at fixation location 38. This can be accomplished by pulling outer tubular member 23 in a
proximal "P" direction while maintaining the position of inner tubular member 36, by pushing inner
tubular member 36 in a distal "D" direction while maintaining the position of outer tubular member, or by
a combination thereof. The relative axial movement of the inner and outer tubular members as shown in
Figure 2a applies substantially opposing compressive and tensile forces to the spines of the tubular
members, thus deflecting, or steering, the device in the direction of spine 40 of outer tubular member 34,
as is shown in Figure 2a. Figure 2b illustrates a step of steering device 30 in the substantially opposite
direction from that shown in Figure 2a. To steer device 30 into the configuration shown in Figure 2b,
inner tubular member is moved proximally relative to outer tubular member 34. This can be performed by
moving the outer tubular member distally, moving the inner tubular member proximally, or a combination
thereof. This relative axial movement applies substantially opposing compressive and tensile forces to
the spines in steerable portion 32 of device 30, thereby deflecting the device in a direction substantially
opposite that of spine 40 of outer tubular member 34.
 [00681       Figure 2c shows a sectional view of the steerable portion from Figure 2b, including optional
floating tubular member 505 disposed within inner tubular member 504. Steerable portion 500 includes
inner tubular member 504 and outer tubular member 502. Inner tubular member 504 has interrupted slots
512 formed therein to define spine 506. Outer tubular member 502 has interrupted slots 510 formed
therein to define spine 508. The steerable portion is bent along the axis of spine 506. Spine 508 and spine
506 are substantially 180 degrees apart from one another (i.e., they are on substantially opposite sides of
steerable portion 500).
 100691       To steer steerable portion 500 into the configuration shown in Figure 2c (also shown in
Figure 2b), inner tubular member 504 is pulled in the proximal direction relative to outer tubular member
502, as is illustrated in Figure 2b. Pulling on the inner member 504 applies a tensile force to inner spine
506. Because inner and outer tubular members 504 and 502 are axially fixed relative to one another at a
location distal to the steerable portion, pulling on inner member 504 relative to outer tubular member 502
results in a compressive force applied to the distal end of the steerable portion of outer tubular member
502. The compressive force begins to compress slots 510 on outer tubular member 502. Compression of
outer slots 510 causes outer tubular member to bend in the direction shown in Figure 2c, and the bending
stops when inner slots 510 are closed. Thus, outer slots 510 limit the degree of the bend of steerable
portion 500. The same type of bending that is shown in Figures 2b and 2c would occur if outer tubular
element 502 were pushed distally relative to inner tubular member 504.
 100701       If outer tubular member 502 were pulled proximally relative to inner tubular member 504 (or
if inner tubular member 504 were pushed distally relative to outer tubular member 502), steerable portion
                                                        7

   WO 2010/151698                                                                         PCT/US2010/039865
500 would bend in the manner shown in Figure 2a. The degree of the bend would be limited by inner
slots 512.
[00711        Figure 2c illustrates an embodiment of a medical device including a floating tubular member,
which may be referred to herein as a floating liner. In general, a floating liner is disposed within an outer
structure. In the exemplary embodiment in Figure 2c, the outer structure includes the inner and outer
tubular members. The outer structure generally provides structural and mechanical properties for the
delivery device, and the floating liner provides lubricity for a medical device or instrument to be
advanced therethrough. A floating liner is generally impermeable as well. A floating liner "floats" with a
portion of the outer structure. That is, the floating liner is not fixed to a portion of the outer structure in
which it floats. In the exemplary embodiment in Figures 2c, the floating liner floats within the steerable
portion (i.e., is not attached to the steerable portion). In general, a floating liner is attached to the outer
structure at a location proximal to the steerable or bendable portion of the device. For example, in the
embodiment in Figure 2C, the floating liner is attached to the outer structure at a location proximal to the
steerable portion. A floating liner doesn't impede the ability of the outer structure to move as it is steered,
bent, actuated, receives forces applied thereto, etc.
 [00721       In some embodiments the floating liner is a lubricious polymer tube. In some embodiments
the floating liner includes wire windings and/or axially laid wires.
 [0073]       The outer structure in which the floating liner floats can be any suitable tubular member. For
 example, the outer structure can be a catheter, guiding device, a steerable device, etc. In some
 embodiments the outer structure has a neutral bending preference but is not intended to be steered. In this
 embodiment the outer structure provides axial and radial stiffness thereby limiting the likelihood of kinks
 while the floating liner provides lubricity and is additionally restrained from kinking by the outer
 structure.
 [00741       Figures 2a and 2b also show proximal portion 35 of device 30, which is proximal to steerable
 portion 32, having a substantially neutral portion designed to have no preferential bending axis while at
 the same time transmitting axial force and torque applied at a proximal end of the device (not shown).
 100751        In some embodiments, the inner and outer tubular members are adapted to have opposing
 compressive and tensile loads applied thereto to steer the steerable portion. In some embodiments at least
 one of the tubular members has a neutral bending axis. A neutral bending axis, as used herein, generally
 refers to an axis of the tubular member along which there is substantially no axial displacement in
 response to a compressive and/or tensile force applied thereto. Axial displacement along the neutral
 bending axis, in response to a compressive and/or tensile force applied thereto, is less than axial
 displacement of structures elsewhere in the tubular member. In particular, axial displacement along the
 neutral bending axis is minimal relative to axial displacement of structures elsewhere in the tubular
 member. Examples of a neutral bending axis include spine 382 in Figure 21 and spines 412 and 414 in
 Figure 23.
  [00761       In some embodiments at least one of the tubular members is adapted to offset the neutral
 bending axis relative to the opposite tubular member. The neutral bending axes of the tubular members
                                                          8

   WO 2010/151698                                                                      PCT/US2010/039865
can be offset to be approximately tangent to opposite sides of the opposing members, making the neutral
bending axis offset equal to the diameter of the device, thus providing the highest possible bending
leverage ratio for a given device diameter.
10077]        The tubular members described herein may exhibit preferential or neutral bending behavior.
Neutral bending behavior implies that the displacement for a given radially applied load (from the edge of
the tubular member through the longitudinal axis of the tubular member) will be independent of the radial
angle from which the load was applied. In contrast, in a non-neutral structure the displacement associated
with a radial load will change as a function of the radial angle. An exemplary tubular member tending
towards neutral bending behavior is shown in Figure 25 or the uninterrupted spiral pattern of Figure 25
which is essentially a spring.
100781        In some embodiments the inner and outer tubular elements are adapted to be rotated relative
to one another to enhance the steerability of the steerable portion. The tubular elements can rotate relative
to one another yet remain axially fixed relative to one another at a location distal to the steerable portion.
In these embodiments, in addition to axial forces being applied to one or more tubes, one or more tubular
members are also rotated with respect to each other to steer the steerable portion.
 [00791       In some embodiments only one of the inner and outer tubular members has at least one slot
defining a spine along the steerable portion, while the other does not have any slots along the steerable
portion. For example, in Figures 2a and 2b, outer tubular member 34 can have a slot and a spine while
inner tubular member 36 does not have a slot formed therein. Alternatively, inner tubular member 36 can
have at least one slot and a spine while outer tubular member 34 does not have a slot formed therein. The
steerable portion can be steered as described herein if at least one of the inner and outer tubular members
is adapted to preferentially bend in a first direction.
 100801       In the embodiment in Figures 1 and 2 the slots in both tubular members are substantially
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the steerable portion. The slots in one or both of the tubular
members can be, however, at an angle relative to the longitudinal axis that is other than substantially 90
degrees.
 100811       In some embodiments the steerable device also includes a tubular element disposed between
the inner and outer tubular members. The intermediate member can be, for example without limitation, a
 flexible polymeric material. The intermediate member can be encasing one or both of the tubular
 members, or comprising one or both of the members. The intermediate member can be adapted to
 provide a fluid barrier and/or a low friction surface.
 [00821        Slots as described herein can be formed in a tubular member by laser machining or other
 machining processes. Forming the slots creates at least one spine in a tubular member. A spine as used
 herein can be considered a region of the steerable portion that imparts axial stiffness in compression or
 tension, or both, and may additionally include features that provide torsional stiffness. When a single
 spine is created in a tubular member, the neutral bending axis of the tubular member is moved to the spine
 of the tubular member.

[0083]        In some embodiments, a tubular member includes at least two spines, the combination of
which moves the neutral bending axis of the tubular member to an axis parallel to, or tangent to when
bent, the longitudinal axis of the tubular device and passing through the spines.
[00841        In some embodiments a liner, such as a flexible polymer liner, is bonded on the inner surface
of the inner tubular member. In some embodiments a flexible polymer is bonded or otherwise disposed
over the outer surface of the outer tubular member. A liner can also be disposed such that it is encasing
the inner tubular member.
100851        In some embodiments the steerable portion is comprised of a first tubular member that is
adapted to bend preferentially in a first direction and a second tubular member that is not adapted to bend
preferentially in one direction. In some instances of these embodiments, the second tubular member is a
flexible polymer material with or without a braided or wire support. In some instances, a wire or other
structural support is included in the first tubular member in the deflectable area to increase compressive
and tensile stiffness along one side of the tubular member, thus moving the neutral bending axis from the
longitudinal axis of the tubular member to the side of the tubular member that includes the structural
support. In some instances wires are laid longitudinally and distributed evenly to increase axial stiffness
in tension without creating a preferential bending.
[00861        In some embodiments the device includes three tubular members, having three offset neutral
bending axes approximately 120 degrees radially spaced apart, thus providing the steerable device with
universal steering in any direction.
[00871        Figure 3 illustrates, for ease of description, a flattened, or unrolled, portion of exemplary
tubular member 50, which can be an inner or an outer tubular member. Tubular member 50 includes
fixation region 52, steerable portion 54, and a proximal neutral portion 58. Steerable portion 54 includes
a plurality of slots 56 formed therein to define spine 55 extending along the steerable portion. Slots 56
are sinuous-shaped slots, and spine 55 has a generally straight configuration along the length of steerable
portion 54. That is, spine 55 is substantially parallel with the longitudinal axis of the tubular member.
Fixation region 52 includes a plurality of holes 57 to facilitate bonding to provide for axial fixation
relative to a second tubular member (not shown). Proximal portion 58 includes a plurality of multiple
overlapping slots 60 to provide the desired flexibility, axial force transmission, and torque transmission
characteristics.
[00881        Figure 4 illustrates a flattened, or unrolled, portion of exemplary tubular member 61, which
can be an inner or an outer tubular member of a steerable portion. Tubular member 61 includes fixation
region 62, steerable portion 64, and proximal neutral bending portion 68. Neutral bending portion 68 will
exhibit minimal bending preference upon a compressive or tensile force applied thereto. Tubular member
61 is similar to tubular member 50 shown in Figure 3, but includes linking elements 72, which can be
flexible. Each linking element extends from one side of a slot to the other side. Each linking element
includes two arm portions extending from one side of the slot to the other side of the slot. The two arms
meet at the point at which they are connected to one side of the slot. The linking elements extend along
steerable portion 64 on substantially the opposite side as spine 65. Linking elements 72 enhance and/or

control torque response and bending of steerable portion 64. As steerable portion 64 is bent about spine
65, linking elements 72 bend and stretch under tension. As steerable portion 64 is twisted, or put in
torque, linking elements 72 are put in compression. In torque, the gap between a given linking element
and the section of the tubular member proximally adjacent to the given linking element collapses,
effectively increasing the torsional stiffness of steerable portion 64.
 [00891       Figure 5 illustrates a flattened portion of exemplary tubular member 80, including fixation
portion 82, steerable portion 84, and proximal neutral portion 86. The embodiment in Figure 5 is similar
to the outer tubular member as shown in Figures 2a and 2b. Steerable portion 84 includes substantially
straight slots 90 that are substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of tubular member 80. Spine
88 is substantially straight in configuration, extending along the length of steerable portion 84
substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tubular member 80. Fixation portion 82 includes
holes 92 therethrough (four shown) to facilitate bonding. Proximal portion 86 has multiple overlapping
slots 94 to give the desired flexibility, axial force and torque transmission.
 [00901       Figure 6 illustrates a flattened portion of exemplary tubular member 96, including fixation
portion 98, steerable portion 100, and proximal neutral portion 102. Steerable portion 100 includes
substantially straight slots 108 that are substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of tubular
member 96, but each is offset relative to the adjacent slot so that spine 106 has a sinuous shape extending
along the length of steerable portion 100. Fixation portion 98 includes holes 104 therethrough (four
shown) to facilitate bonding. Proximal portion 102 includes multiple overlapping slots 110 to give the
desired flexibility, axial force and torque transmission characteristics.
 [0091]       Figures 7a and 7b illustrate exemplary portions of flattened first and second tubular members
 112 and 128. First tubular member 112 can be an inner tubular member and second tubular member 128
can be an outer tubular member, or first tubular member 112 can be an outer tubular member and second
tubular member 128 can be an inner tubular member. Tubular members 112 and 128 can be assembled as
part of a steerable delivery device. That is, one of the first and second tubular members can be disposed
within the other. First tubular member 112 includes fixation portion 114, steerable portion 116, and
proximal neutral portion 118. Fixation portion 114 includes holes 120. Steerable portion 116 has slots
 124 formed therein to define spine 122. Spine 122 has a generally sinuous shape. Proximal portion 118
includes a plurality of overlapping slots 126. Second tubular member 128 includes fixation portion 130,
steerable portion 132, and proximal neutral portion 134. Fixation portion 130 includes holes 136.
Steerable portion 132 has slots 140 formed therein to define spine 138. Spine 138 has a generally sinuous
shape. Proximal portion 134 includes a plurality of overlapping slots 142.
 100921       In Figures 7a and 7b, the slots in each of tubular members 112 and 128 are offset relative to
the adjacent slot, interrupted, and have a general helical configuration. Spines 122 and 138 have
generally sinuous configurations. The slots in the tubular members are at the same angle relative to the
longitudinal axis of the tubular member, but are formed in opposite helical patterns. A advantage of
having inner and outer tubular members with slots that are not in alignment (as opposed to inner and outer
tubular members that have slots perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tubular member) is that the
                                                        11

slots are less likely to get caught up on one another as the steerable portion is steered. The angled slots
shown in Figures 7a and 7b also provide for an increased torque response based on a torque applied at the
proximal end of the device.
[00931        Figure 8 illustrates a portion of an exemplary steerable delivery device. Steerable device 150
includes outer tubular member 152, inner tubular member 154, and intermediate tubular member 156. A
portion of outer tubular member 152 and intermediate member 156 are cut away to show inner tubular
member 154. Intermediate tubular member 156 can be a flexible polymeric tube. Inner and outer tubes
152 and 154 have slots 160, 164 formed therein to define spines 158 and 162. The spines are substantially
180 degrees apart, as shown. The slots formed in the respective tubular members are at an angle relative
to the longitudinal axis of the steerable portion and are formed in opposite helical patterns.
[00941        Figure 9 illustrates a portion of an exemplary steerable delivery device. Steerable device 166
includes outer tubular member 168 and inner tubular member 170. Inner tubular member 170 can be a
flexible polymeric tubular element. Outer tubular member 168 has a plurality of slots 174 formed therein
to define spine 172. Inner tubular member 170 has no preferential bending axis. Inner tubular member
170 could alternatively have a modified bending axis offset by having, for example, a stiffening element
incorporated into the wall of inner tubular member 170 approximately 180 degrees from spine 172. In
some embodiments inner tubular member 170 may incorporate wire braids and or axially-laid wires
which reduce kinkability and increase axial stiffness as is common in braided catheters or other similar
known tubular medical devices.
[00951        Figure 10 illustrates a portion of an exemplary steerable delivery device. Steerable delivery
device 178 includes outer tubular member 180 and inner tubular member 182. Outer tubular member 180
can be, for example, a flexible polymeric tubular member. Inner tubular member 182 has a plurality of
slots 186 formed therein to define spine 184, which is substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the
steerable portion. Outer tubular member 180 has no preferential bending axis. Alternatively, outer
tubular member 180 can have a preferential bending axis. For example, a structural support element can
be incorporated into the wall of outer tubular member 180 approximately 180 degrees from spine 184.
Outer tubular member 180 can be substantially the same as inner tubular element 170 in Figure 9, but for
any lubricity enhancing feature. In some embodiments inner tubular member 170 may incorporate wire
braids and or axially laid wires which reduce kinkability and increase axial stiffness as is common in
braided catheter or other similar known tubular medical device.
 [0096]       In an alternative embodiment, the device includes inner and outer slotted tubes, and
additionally includes an outermost tubular member similar to 180 shown in Figure 10. The outermost
tubular member can be, for example without limitation, a polymeric tubular member.
 [00971       Figure 11 a illustrates a portion of an exemplary embodiment of a first tubular member that
can be included in a steerable delivery device. Tubular member 190 is a tubular member formed from a
ribbon wire. Tubular member 190 has spine 192 formed by coiling a ribbon shaped with interlocking
elements 194 and 196, which together form an interlocking feature along spine 192. Interlocking
elements 194 and 196 may be press-fit to interlock the two. The interlocking elements can be encased
                                                         12

with a tubular member, such as a polymer tubular member, to secure them in place. The interlocking
elements can also, or alternatively, have a polymer tubular member disposed therein to help secure them
in place. In addition to the interlocking features, the ribbon wire has sections of decreased width 198
which once wound into a tubular structure create the steerable portion for flexibility. A second tubular
member of the steerable delivery device can be created in a similar manner to the tubular member in
Figure 11 a. Figure 11 b illustrates an embodiment of the ribbon with interlocking elements 196 and
decreased width regions 200 between elements 196. The angle of interlocking elements 196 relative to
the longitudinal axis of the tubular element can be varied based on the pitch of the coil. Such a pattern
can additionally be fabricated by laser machining.
[00981        Figures 12a and 12b illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a tubular member. Tubular
member 210 comprises a tube 214 with grooves 212 formed therein on the outer surface of tube 214.
Grooves 212 do not extend all the way through tube 214. Tubular member can be, for example, a stiff
polymeric tubular member. Figure 12a shows a sectional view of a portion of tubular 210 showing the
depth of grooves 212 in the steerable portion. Figure 12b illustrates a flattened view of tubular member
210 showing grooves 212 formed in tube 214. Grooves 212 define a single substantially straight spine
216. Grooves 212 cut into tube 214 increase flexibility of the steerable portion to allow the steerable
portion to be steered. Spine 216 provides for the application of compressive and tensile forces to steer the
device. Because the cut does not go all the way through the wall of the tube, it inherently creates a fluid
tight barrier and a lubricious liner. In some embodiments tubular member 210 can an inner or outer
tubular member of a steerable device, and the other of the inner and outer tubular elements can also
includes a tubular element with grooves formed thereon. In some embodiments the steerable device can
also have a polymeric sleeve to encapsulate the outer tube to create a smooth outer surface.
 [00991       Figure 13a illustrates a portion of an exemplary introducer sheath reinforcement member 220.
Member 220 is formed by laser cutting a tubular member to slots or gaps therein. A helical slot 222
defines interlocking T-shaped patterns 224 formed in reinforcement member 220. The helical path is
shown generally in helical path 226. Flexibility slots 228 are formed in member 220 to provide flexibility
to member 220. Member 220 also includes bonding slots 230 formed therein to allow for bonding to one
 or more components of the device. Figure 13b illustrates member 220 from Figure 13a in a flattened
pattern showing the interlocking T-shaped pattern along helical path 226, flexibility slots 228, and
 bonding slots 230. Figure 13c shows a close-up of the section shown in Figure 13b.
 [00100]      In some embodiments a guide catheter includes a relatively rigid metal or polymer
 reinforcement member (an example of which is shown in Figure 13a-13c) layered between an inner and
 an outer flexible polymer tube. The rigid reinforcement member can be laser machined or otherwise cut
 in a pattern in order to enhance flexibility along the longitudinal axis of the tube, to allow some limited
 radial compliance, and to allow bonding of the inner and outer flexible polymers. The slot pattern can
 include an interlocking T-shaped pattern arranged helically around the tube for flexibility and radial
 compliance, a slot pattern where the slots are substantially perpendicular to the tube longitudinal axis, and
 are patterned along the tube longitudinal axis to further enhance flexibility and bonding of said layers.

[00101]       Figure 14 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a guide system adapted to guide and
deliver a therapeutic, diagnostic, interventional, or any other type of medical device 260 intraluminaly to
a target location within a body. Guide system 250 includes outer guide member 252 and steerable
delivery device 256, a portion of which is disposed within outer guide member 250. Steerable delivery
device 256 can be, for example, any of the steerable delivery devices described herein. Outer guide
member 252 has a preset bend 254 that can be formed by, for example, heat setting. Steerable delivery
device 256 includes steerable portion 258, which can be formed as, for example, any of the steerable
portions described herein. For example, steerable delivery device can include outer and inner tubular
members, wherein at least one of the tubular members is adapted to preferentially bend in a first direction.
In the embodiment shown in Figure 14, steerable portion 258 is comprised of a single steerable tubular
member steered into the configuration shown in Figure 14 by actuating pull wire 264. Alternatively,
steerable delivery device 256 can be comprised of the embodiment described in Figure 2, and steered by
relative axial movement of inner and outer tubular members, as described herein.
[001021       Alternatively, outer guide member 252 can be adapted to be bent using optional pull wire
262, shown in Figure 14. In such an embodiment bend 254 may or may not preset. Guide member 250
comprises a tubular member incorporating a pattern of slots as described for steering portions herein.
When located in position pull wire 262 is tensioned and the axial and torsional stiffness of bend 254 is
thereby increased. A steerable outer guide member 252 in its delivery configuration (non-bent) is
generally loose and compliant, but is tensioned or compressed to reconfigure it into a pre-set shape. Its
stiffness in the bent configuration is a function of the amount of tension or compression applied and the
particular slot pattern chosen.
 [00103]      Bend 254 in outer guide member 252 is compliant enough to be straightened for delivery, for
example advanced on a guide wire, but rigid enough to be able to guide steerable delivery device 256
around bend 254. Steerable delivery device 256 is steerable and transmits torque.
 [001041      The structural properties of the inner and outer tubular members of the steerable delivery
device will determine the manner in which they respond to force applied thereon. The structural
properties of the inner and/or outer tubes will depend on the tubing material and the design, or
characteristics, of the slots created in the tubular members (unless one of the inner and outer tubular
members does not have any slots therein). The design of the slot pattern is therefore a function of the
required structural properties of the tubular member. For example, structural properties of the tubular
 member that can be modified by changing the design of the slots or slot patterns include flexural stiffness,
torque transmission, steerability, radius of curvature, and allowable wall thickness of the steerable
 assembly.
 1001051       Figure 15 is a flattened view and illustrates a portion of an exemplary steerable portion of a
 tubular member. Tubular member 290 can be an inner or an outer tubular member as described herein.
 Steerable portion 290 is typically a laser-cut tubular member, but may in fact be fabricated by any
 technique capable of creating the appropriate widths of cuts required (e.g., water jet, wire EDM, etc.)
 wherein first cut, or slot, 292 is made, defined by first surface 294 and second surface 296. Slot 292

extends almost all the way around tubular member 290, and defines spine 308. Slots 282 are thickest,
along the tubular longitudinal axis, along compression axis C which allows tubular member to be
compressed along compression axis C, which changes the configuration of tubular member 290. Tubular
member 290 also includes interlocking features 298 (only one of which is labeled), which include first
interlocking element 300 and second interlocking element 302. Slot 292 includes slot portion 304, which
is defined by the first and second interlocking elements 300 and 302 and allows for movement between
the two interlocking elements 300 and 302 in the axial direction. Tubular member 290 also includes
stress relief slots 306, which extend across spine 308 and provide stress relief for spine 308. Stress relief
slots 306 can be considered to be axially in-between slots 292. Slots 292 are not connected with slots
306. Slots 306 are substantially thinner than slots 292. As will be described in detail below, tubular
member 290 is adapted to be compressed along compression axis C, which is substantially 180 degree
from spine 308.
 1001061      Figures 16a and 16b illustrate a portion of tubular member 290 shown in Figure 15. Figure
 16b illustrates tubular member 290 with slot 292, with a greatest thickness along compression axis C.
 Slot 292 includes slot 304, which is defined by interlocking elements 300 and 303. Slot 292 and slot 304
allow for compression of tubular member 290, shown in Figure 16a. When a compressive force A is
 applied along compressive axis C surfaces 294 and 296 are brought closer towards another, as are
 surfaces 300 and 302. Slots 292 and 304 therefore allow for axial compression of tubular member 290,
 until surfaces 294 and 296 engage one another, or until surfaces 300 and 302 engage one another,
whichever happens first. Slots 292 and 304 can be designed such that the slots close at the same time.
 Once the surfaces engage, they behave substantially like a solid tube and can no longer be compressed
 along the engagement points. Upon a compressive force to tubular member 290, tubular member will
 therefore be steered into the configuration shown in Figure 16a. Similarly, when a tensile force is applied
 to tubular member 290 shown in Figure 16a, tubular member 290 will straighten to the configuration
 shown in Figure 16b. Particularly, tubular member 290 will straighten until the interlocking features
 engage one another and prevent further movement. Figure 16c illustrates the tubular member from
 Figures 16a and 16b and indicates points of load application including those illustrated in Figures 16b and
 16c. Torsional force T indicates a torsional force acting on tubular member 290 upon the application of
 torque at a proximal end of the device. Tensile and compressive forces are listed as "a" or "b" depending
 on the behavior exhibited by the tubular member as described below.
 1001071       Figure 17 is a graph illustrating Force v. Displacement behavior associated with the
 application of loads or displacements at various points around tubular member 290 shown in Figures 15
  16c. The Force/Displacement behavior of tubular member 290 for loads applied in planes passing
 through the longitudinal axis of the tubular member, ranges between the lines A and B in Figure 17.
 Curve A illustrates the behavior along a compliant axis on the surface of the tubular member and parallel
 to the longitudinal axis of the tubular member where the slots are widest, while curve B illustrates the
 behavior where the slots are vary narrow. As the tubular member is bent about spine 308 in a fashion
 which closes slots 292, the forces required to bend the tubular member are low and the
                                                         15

   WO 2010/151698                                                                      PCT/US2010/039865
 Force/Displacement curve has a small slope. The tubular member is compliant in this region. When the
 width of the slots decreases to zero the structure becomes much stiffer as indicated by the second much
 higher slope region of curve A. The amount of displacement associated with closing the slots is
 essentially indicated by point D where the slope of the Force/Displacement curve changes. Curve A
 indicates the behavior expected from forces applied at a point along compressive axis C, illustrating that a
 large amount of axial displacement follows from minimal compressive force on tubular member 290.
Upon closing slots, the compressive axis becomes stiff (indicated by the large increase in Force at point D
 in the curve). Curve B in the graph indicates compression along the axis running through spine 308. Due
to stress relief slots 306, a small amount of compressive displacement occurs before spine 308 stiffens
and begins to act substantially like a solid tube, as indicated by point E in the graph. The structure will
exhibit the behavior of curve B for tensional loads applied to the top of the structure on the compressive
axis C as the gaps closed under this loading are very narrow. Curve B also represents the behavior of the
structure to torsional loads, as the gaps impacted most by these loads are narrow.
 1001081      Figure 18 illustrates a flattened view of exemplary tubular member 320. Slot 330, or cut,
formed therein has a spiral (also referred to herein as helical) pattern and is un-interrupted. Tubular
member 320 is shown in an as-cut compressed configuration, and is adapted to be expanded the greatest
amount along expansion axis EA upon the application of a tensile force thereto. Tubular member 320
includes interlocking features 332, which include surfaces 322 and 324, and surfaces 326 and 328. Slot
330 includes the slot defined by surfaces 326 and 328, and by surfaces 322 and 324. In this embodiment
the slot, or gap, defined by surfaces 326 and 328 is larger than the gap defined by surfaces 322 and 324.
That is, the gap that is closer to expansion axis EA is larger than the gap that is further from expansion
axis EA. Tubular member 334 also includes spine 334, which is interrupted by small slots 336. As
illustrated in Figure 16c, tubular member 320, upon the application of axial loads applied thereto, will
exhibit Force/Displacement curves as follows: a compressive force (downwards) applied at EA will
exhibit curve B, while a tensile load at EA (upwards) will exhibit curve A. A torsional load will exhibit
curve B.
 [00109]      Figure 19 is a flattened view and illustrates a portion of a tubular member. Tubular member
270 can be an inner or an outer tubular member as described herein. Steerable portion 270 is a laser-cut
tubular member wherein first cut, or slot, 274 is made to define spine 276. Cut 274 is made almost all the
way around tubular member 270. Cut 274 also defines interlocking features 278 (only one of them is
labeled), which are comprised of a first interlocking element 280 and a second interlocking element 282.
Cut 274 includes cut 284, which creates the interlocking features and allows for movement between the
two interlocking elements. Tubular member 270 also includes stress relief 272, which extend across
spine 276 and provide stress relief for spine 276. Stress relief slots 272 can be considered to be axially in
between slots 274. Slots 274 are not connected with slots 272. Tubular member 270 is adapted to be
expanded along expansion axis EA, and is adapted to be minimally compressible upon the application of
compressive forces thereto. Spine 276 is substantially static. Upon the application of tensile forces to
                                                        16

tubular member 270 along expansion axis EA, tubular member 270 will deflect from a straightened
configuration into a bent configuration.
[001101       Figure 20 illustrates an embodiment similar to that shown in Figure 18 and only differences
in the structure between the two will be described. All other features can be considered the same.
Tubular member 350 includes interlocking features including interlocking elements 354 and 356. Slot
360 created in tubular member 350 includes the gap defined by surfaces of interlocking elements 354 and
356.
 1001111      Figure 21 illustrates a flattened portion of an exemplary tubular member 380 including
interrupted cuts 390 that define spine 382. Tubular member 380 includes interlocking features 384,
which include interlocking elements 386 and 388. Interlocking features 384 allow for expansion along
expansion axis EA upon the application of a tensile force thereto. Tubular member 380, like all tubular
members described herein unless specifically stated otherwise, can be incorporated into a steerable
portion as an inner or an outer tubular member.
 [001121      Figure 22 illustrates a flattened portion of an exemplary tubular member 400. Interrupted
 slots 404 define spine 402, which has a spiral shape. Tubular member 400 does not have static axis.
 1001131      Figure 23 illustrates a flattened portion of an exemplary tubular member 410. Tubular
 member 410 includes interrupted helical slots 418, which define spines 412 and 414. Tubular member
 410 has two spines, 180 degrees around the periphery of the device from one other. The helical cut
 pattern repeats itself every 180 degrees to define substantially straight spines. Tubular member 410 also
 includes a plurality of interlocking features 420 which provide torsional stiffness. The maximal
 expansion/compression is at axis 416.
 [001141      Figure 24 illustrates a flattened portion of an exemplary tubular member 430, which is similar
 to the embodiment in Figure 23 but rather than repeating every 180 degrees, the cut pattern repeats every
 360 degrees. Slots 434 have an interrupted helical design, and tubular member 430 has a single spine
 432. Feature 436 provides additional torsional stiffness. Tubular member 430 exhibits maximal
 expansion/compression along axis 438.
 [001151      Figure 25 illustrates a flattened portion of an exemplary tubular member 440. Tubular
 member 440 includes slots 448, which repeat every 190 degrees to define spines 442 and 446. The slots
 have an interrupted helical pattern, and create a relatively neutral pattern.
  [001161      Figure 26 illustrates a flattened portion of an exemplary tubular member 450. Tubular
 member 450 has uninterrupted slot 456 formed therein, which repeats every 360 degrees. Tubular
 member 450 also includes interlocking features 454 comprised of at least two interlocking elements as
 described herein. In this embodiment, the interlocking elements have complimentary curved surfaces and
  are adapted to support rotation. Slot 456 defines spines 452, while slot 456 allows compression and/or
  expansion along axes A.
  [00117]       Figure 27 illustrates an exemplary steerable delivery device including steerable portion 520.
  Steerable delivery device includes outer tubular member 522, inner tubular member 524, and floating
  inner member 534. Inner tubular member 524 is disposed within and coaxial to outer tubular member
                                                          17

   WO 2010/151698                                                                      PCT/US2010/039865
522, and floating inner member 534 is disposed within and coaxial with inner tubular member 524.
Floating inner member 534 is axially fixed relative to inner tubular member 524 at a location proximal to
steerable portion 520. The device shown in Figure 27 can also include a liner member disposed between
the outer and inner tubular members.
 [001181      Figure 28 illustrates an exemplary steerable delivery system 600. System 600 includes
control device 602 that is adapted to steer steerable portion 610 of a steerable delivery device. The
steerable delivery device includes outer tubular member 606 and inner tubular member 608 disposed
within outer tubular member 606. Control device 602 includes housing 612 with a slot therein adapted to
allow for movement of actuator 604. Actuator 604 is coupled to inner tubular member 608, and is
adapted to be moved axially, either distally D or proximally P to control the axial movement of inner
tubular member 608. Any other suitable type of actuator can also be used including actuators
incorporating mechanical advantage. Actuation of actuator 604 causes inner tubular member 608 to move
axially relative to outer tubular member, which causes steerable portion 610 to bend. The control device
is therefore adapted to steer steerable portion 610 inside of a subject. System 600 also includes a floating
liner member 616 and hemostatic valve 614.
[001191       One aspect of the disclosure is a guide device that is adapted to be maintained, or locked, in a
specific configuration to provide access for a medical device or instrument to be passed therethrough, but
may or may not be steerable. In Figures 2A-2C, steerable portion 32 is adapted to be steered or deflected
into any configuration between those shown in Figures 2A and 2B. Steerable portion is adapted to be
steered to, for example, navigate bends or turns within a bodily lumen. In that specific embodiment,
compressive and/or tensile forces are applied to the inner and/or outer tubular members to steer the
steerable portion. In some embodiments, once steerable portion 32 is steered into a curved configuration,
the forces applied thereto (e.g., compressive, tensile, torsional) can be released, and yet a medical device
or instrument can be passed through the tubular members. In some embodiments, however, the bent
configuration of the steerable portion can be maintained by maintaining the application of the forces
thereto. For example, in Figures 2A-2C, steerable portion 32 can be maintained, or locked, in the bent
configurations shown by maintaining the application of the compressive and/or tensile forces. By
maintaining the application of the forces to the steerable portion or locking the relative displacements of
the inner and outer tubes, the inner and outer tubes are substantially axially fixed relative to one another
along the length of the steerable portion.
 [001201      In an exemplary method of use, multiple bend portions may be incorporated and adapted to
have a locked configuration that closely mimics, or resembles, a portion of the subject's anatomy. The
bend portion can be advanced through the subject (e.g., over a guide wire) to a desired location, and can
then be actuated into a curved configuration, such as by the application of compressive and/or tensile
forces thereto. The curved configuration can be adapted to resemble the path of the anatomical lumen in
which the device is positioned. Application of the actuation force maintains, or stiffens, the bend portions
in the desired curved configuration. A medical device or instrument can then be advanced through the
curved portion to a target location within the subject.

   WO 2010/151698                                                                     PCT/US2010/039865
[001211      The device shown in Figure 14 can alternatively be configured to be operated in this manner.
For example, steerable delivery device 256 in Figure 14 can be actuated to have a first bend or curved
region 254 and a second bend or curved region 258. The curves, or bends, form a general S-shaped
portion of the device. The delivery device 256 can be maintained, or locked, in the general S-shape to
guide a medical device or instrument therethrough. The S-shape of the delivery device 256 can be used if
it resembles a portion of the anatomy into which it is placed, but any other type of preformed
configuration can be used, depending on the anatomical requirements. In the alternative to Figure 14, the
delivery device can be actuated into the configuration shown by the application of compressive and/or
tensile forces to inner and outer tubular members, as is described herein.
 1001221     Figures 29A and 29B illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a portion of a lockable device
adapted to be locked, or maintained, in a specific configuration that mimics that of a portion of the
subject's anatomy. In the unlocked form the structure is compliant and easily guidable whereas in the
locked form the device is rigid in its predetermined form. The device can then be used to provide access
for a medical device or instrument to be passed therethrough to a target location within the subject. Bend
portion 700 of the device includes a plurality of beads, 702, 704, and 706. Bead 702 is the distal-most
bead, bead 706 is the proximal-most bead and beads 704 are disposed between the two end beads 702 and
706. The beads are separate and distinct structural features, not mechanically coupled to one another.
Each bead has two bores 715 therethrough, each adapted to receive one of the two control wires 708.
Control wires 708 are secured only to distal bead 702, using any suitable technique (e.g., adhesive).
Wires 708 therefore are adapted to be axially moveable relative to beads 704 and 706. Proximal bead 706
has a substantially constant height H around the periphery of the bead, while beads 702 and 704 do not
have a constant height. Specifically, the height of the beads 702 and 704 decreases around a portion of
each of the beads. The gap between adjacent beads is therefore relatively large between bead 702 and
704, and between beads 704, while the gap between bead 706 and the adjacent bead 704 is relatively
 small compared to the other gaps.
 1001231      To adjust the lockable portion into its predetermined form, an axially directed (i.e., distally
 directed) compressive force C is applied to proximal bead 706 while maintaining wires 208 is position.
 Maintaining wires 208 in position can occur based on a proximally directed tensile force applied to wires
 208, or wires 208 may be secured to a portion of the delivery system that is not actuated. This causes the
 distance between surfaces 711 and 713 to decrease, until they engage one another as shown in Figure
 29B. The actuation force is continued until all of the beads' adjacent surfaces are engaged, as shown in
 the configuration in Figure 29B. In Figure 29B, lockable portion 700 is in a bent configuration adapted
 to mimic a portion of the patient's anatomy in which it is to be positioned. Figure 29B also shows a
 section portion of one side of the beads through which one of wires 708 passes. Lockable portion is
 maintained in the locked configuration in Figure 29B by maintaining the distally directed compressive
 force to proximal bead 706 or the relative displacements between distal bead 702 and proximal bead 706.
 Lockable portion 208 can also be bent into the configuration shown in Figure 29B upon the application of
 a proximally directed tensile force applied to wires 708, while applying a distally directed compressive
                                                        19

   WO 2010/151698                                                                     PCT/US2010/039865
force to proximal bead 706. While six beads are shown in Figures 29A and 29B, the lockable portion can
have two or more beads.
1001241       Figures 30A-30H show exemplary beads that can be incorporated into a lockable portion as
described herein. Figure 30A illustrates bead 716 with wire bores 717 therethrough. The height H of bead
716 is substantially constant. When the height is substantially constant, the planes through the proximal
and distal ends of the beads are substantially parallel. When the height is not constant, the planes are not
parallel. Bead 716 is the same as proximal bead 706 in Figure 29A. In an embodiment with a lockable
portion comprised entirely of beads that have a constant height, the lockable portion would have a straight
configuration under compression. Figure 30B shows bead 718 with bores therethrough, wherein the
height at portion 720 is less than at portion 721. Bead 718 has the same general shape as beads 702 and
704 in Figure 29A. The height of portion 720 can be adjusted to modify the curvature of the lockable
portion. Generally, as height 720 decreases, the degree of the bend increases (i.e., the radius of curvature
decreases). Similarly, the height of portion 721 can be modified to modify the curvature. Figure 30C
illustrates bead 722 that can be injection molded. Bead 722 includes two outer wire features 724 and two
inner wire features 726 formed in bead 722. Each outer wire feature has a portion that overlaps with a
portion the corresponding inner wire feature to define an opening through which a control wire can pass.
Molding the bead with the wire features to create the wire bore can be easier than forming a hole the
entire way through the bead. Bead 722 is formed to have 2 control wires pass therethrough. Figure 30D
illustrates bead 730 that can be injection molded. Bead 730 includes two indentations 732 and two
indentations 734. The indentations in bead 730 allow for the height of wire bore 736 to be less than it
would be without the indentations. The indentations can make the wire bores easier to mold. Figure 30E
illustrates bead 740 including tabs 742 stamped therein. The tabs are stamped in the body of bead 740 to
form wire openings 744, through which a control wire is passed. Bead 740 can be, for example, a
hypotube, sheet metal rolled into an annular shape, etc. Figure 30F is similar to Figure 30E and includes
interlocking features including interlocking elements 754 (male) and 756 (female). The interlocking
features generally enhance torque transmission. The interlocking feature could be comprised of any
interlocking elements described herein or any other suitable interlocking elements. Figure 30G illustrates
bead 760 including an inner corrugated member 764 and outer member 762. The spaces between inner
member 764 and outer member 762 define control wire bores 768, which are adapted to receive control
wires therethrough. In Figure 30G, twelve control wires can be passed through bead 760. Figure 30H
shows a plurality of beads 760 (from Figure 30G) and 770, each with inner member 764 and outer
member 762. In adjacent beads 760 and 770, the control wire bores are defined by peaks and valleys
formed in the inner members on adjacent beads.
[001251       While the embodiments have been shown with control wires being secured relative to a single
bead, all of the control wires in a lockable portion need not be secured to the same bead. For example, a
control wire can be secured to any bead in the lockable portion.
1001261       The locked configuration of the lockable portion can be modified by modifying
characteristics of the beads. For example, the number of beads in the lockable portion can be modified to
                                                       20

   WO 2010/151698                                                                     PCT/US2010/039865
change the radius of curvature. The height of portion of the beads can be modified, as shown in the
comparison between Figure 30A and 30B. The lockable portion additionally need not include beads of
the same type. For example, a lockable portion could alternate the beads shown in Figures 30A and 30B,
creating a curve with a degree of bend less than that shown in Figure 29A. Beads of similar design can be
rotationally offset from one another along the length of the lockable portion. For example, in the
embodiment in Figure 29A, every other bead could be rotated 90 degrees in the same direction relative to
the adjacent beads. Additionally, the relative angle between the control wire bore axis and the plane of a
bead end can be adjusted. For example, in Figure 30B, the axes of control wire bores 719 can be
substantially 90 degrees relative to the plane of the distal end of bead 718. The axes of bores 719, can,
however, be offset such that they are not substantially 90 degrees relative to the plane of the distal end of
bead 718.
 [001271     The beads as described herein can have almost any length. In some embodiments a bead is a
section of straight tubing. Any bead can also incorporate any of the slotted cut patterns described herein
1001281      While the lockable portions have been shown to include curved, or bent sections, the lockable
device can have a locked configuration in which the device is substantially straight. For example, if the
lockable device included 2 or more beads as shown in Figure 30A, the lockable device would have a
substantially straight locked configuration.
[001291      In some embodiments the lockable device could have a floating liner (as described herein)
disposed therein. The floating liner could, in some embodiments, secured to the distal-most bead. The
lockable device could alternatively or additionally have an outer liner disposed on the outside of the
lockable device. The outer liner could also be secured to the distal-most bead or the outer liner could be
affixed to the inner liner and the beads left to float inside.
[001301      In some embodiments the lockable device (e.g., the device shown in Figures 29A and 29B) is
adapted to be advanced over a steerable device within the subject. For example, a traditional guidewire or
the steerable device shown in Figures 2A-2C can be steered to a desired location within the subject. A
lockable device, such as a beaded lockable device described herein, can then be tracked over the steered
device. The lockable device comprising at least two beads is flexible to allow it to follow the curvature of
the steered device. Once the lockable device has been advanced over the steered device to the desired
position, the beads of the lockable device are locked in place as described herein, and the lockable device
assumes its preset configuration.
 [001311     In alternative embodiments, the lockable portion (e.g., the beaded structure in Figures 29A
and 29B) includes a floating liner therein.
 [001321     In an exemplary embodiment of use, a guiding element (e.g., a guidewire) is advanced to a
desired location within the subject. The device comprising the lockable portion is then tracked over the
guiding element until it reaches a desired position. The lockable portion is then actuated to change the
configuration of the lockable portion to the desired configuration. The lockable portion is then
maintained, or locked, in the desired configuration. A medical device, medical instrument, or other
device is then advanced therethrough to a target location within the subject.
