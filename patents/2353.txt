   Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
20 having a game controller having components that enable a
   designated symbol such as a wild symbol to be retained for
   a further game round such as a game of a series of free
   games.   In an embodiment, the wild symbol is modified to
   incorporate a multiplier if another wild symbol is
25 selected for the same position.
   The components of the game controller also enable the
   implementation of a re-spin feature where when it is
   initiated a first subset of the reels   (e.g. a first reel)
30 is spun while s second subset of the reels (e.g. the
   remaining four reels) are spun and re-spun provided an
   additional designated symbol is added to the selected
   symbol by virtue of the reels. In the re-spin, each
   selected designated symbol is held. When no additional
35 designated symbol is selected, the first reel stops
   spinning and the symbols are evaluated for winning
   outcomes.

   General construction of gaming system
   The gaming system can take a number of different forms. In
 5 a first form, a standalone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
   In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
10 wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
   For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
15 wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
   executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
20 operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
   However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
25 envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
   the gaming system may operate in standalone gaming machine
30 mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode depending
   on the game being played, operating conditions, and so on.
   Other variations will be apparent to persons skilled in
   the art.
35 Irrespective of the form, the gaming system has several
   core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
                                            10245972_1 (GHMatters) P100870.AU.2 15/05/18

   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
 5 instructions to play the game and observe the game
   outcomes.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
10 credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
   and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 including one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions             (e.g. to
   place a wager), and one or more speakers 58.
15
   The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
20 display. Typically, the game play rules are stored as
   program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:              a
25 microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
   or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.  That is a processor may be
   provided by any suitable logic circuitry for receiving
   inputs, processing them in accordance with instructions
30 stored in memory   and generating outputs   (for example on
   the display).  Such processors are sometimes also referred
   to as central processing units (CPUs). Most processors are
   general purpose units, however, it is also know to provide
   a specific purpose processor using an application specific
35 integrated circuit (ASIC) or a field programmable gate
   array  (FPGA).

   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
   10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
 5 by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
   game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
10 chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.    Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.  Other gaming machines may configure for ticket in
   such that they have a ticket reader for reading tickets
15 having a value and crediting the player based on the face
   value of the ticker.   A player marketing module (not
   shown) having a reading device may also be provided for
   the purpose of reading a player tracking device, for
   example as part of a loyalty program.    The player tracking
20 device may be in the form of a card, flash drive or any
   other portable storage medium capable of being read by the
   reading device. In some embodiments, the player marketing
   module may provide an additional credit mechanism, either
   by transferring credits to the gaming machine from credits
25 stored on the player tracking device or by transferring
   credits from a player account in data communication with
   the player marketing module that is accessed in response
   to insertion of the player tracking device.
30 A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
   pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.          Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
35 beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
   from the gaming machine 10.

   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a
   liquid crystal display.   The display 14 may any other
   suitable video display unit, such as an OLED display.                       The
   top box 26 may also include a display, which may be of the
 5 same type as the display 14, or of a different type.
   Figure 3 shows a block diagram of operative components of
   a typical gaming machine which may be the same as or
   different to the gaming machine of Figure 2.
10
   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102 mounted on a circuit board.
   Instructions and data to control operation of the
   processor 102 are stored in a memory 103, which is in data
15 communication with the processor 102.    Typically, the
   gaming machine 100 will include both volatile and non
   volatile memory and more than one of each type of memory,
   with such memories being collectively represented by the
   memory 103.
20
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
   communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
25 machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
   devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
30 random numbers for use by the processor 102.           Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
   In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
35 includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 including one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107   (which provide a game play
                                             10245972_1 (GHMatters) P100870.AU.2 15/05/18

   mechanism),  a card and/or ticket reader 108, a printer
   109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input mechanism 110 and a
   coin output mechanism 111.    Additional hardware may be
   included as part of the gaming machine 100, or hardware
 5 may be omitted as required for the specific
   implementation. For example, while buttons or touch
   screens are typically used in gaming machines to allow a
   player to place a wager and initiate a play of a game any
   input device that enables the player to input game play
10 instructions may be used. For example, in some gaming
   machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a play of
   the game. Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate
   that a touch screen can be used to emulate other input
   devices, for example, a touch screen can display virtual
15 buttons which a player can "press" by touching the screen
   where they are displayed.
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
20 The network card may, for example, send status
   information,  accounting information or other information
   to a bonus controller, central controller, server or
   database and receive data or commands from the bonus
   controller, central controller, server or database.                     In
25 embodiments employing a player marketing module,
   communications over a network may be via player marketing
   module -  i.e. the player marketing module may be in data
   communication with one or more of the above devices and
   communicate with it on behalf of the gaming machine.

   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.   The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.                  The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
35 execution by the processor 102 and related data.                  The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.    The mass storage device
                                              10245972_1 (GHMatters) P100870.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 18
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
   the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.

   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
   input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.

   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
   network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
15 two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
   machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
20 implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
25 network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
   associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
30 promotional or informational material.
   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
35 game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
   the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
                                            10245972_1 (GHMatters) P100870.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 19
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
   gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
 5 game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.       A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
   In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
10 most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.   With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
   gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
15 these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
   that provides a player interface operable using standard
20 computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
   incorporated herein by reference.
25
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
   licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
30 relating to particular games.   An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
35 systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
   for example through a firewall 211.
                                            10245972_1 (GHMatters) P100870.AU.2 15/05/18

                                 - 20
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
 5 plurality of different computers.    For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.    For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
10 could be provided.   Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of game servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.

   Further detail of gaming system
   The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to specify
   a wager which will be evaluated by the gaming system for
20 this play of the game and initiates a play of the game.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that a player's
   wager can be varied from game to game dependent on player
   selections. In most spinning reel games, it is typical for
   the player's wager to be made up of a selection as to how
25 the game outcome will be evaluated by specifying what
   parts of the game outcome will qualify for winning
   outcomes and a multiplier that will apply to each winning
   outcome.  For example, a player's  wager may be based on how
   many lines they play in each game -   e.g. a minimum of one
30 line up to the maximum number of lines allowed by the game
    (noting that not all permutations of win lines may be
   available for selection) and an amount per line - e.g.
   one, two or five credits. Winning outcomes on an activated
   win line may be evaluated based on a pay table that
35 specifies the amount awarded for a one credit per line
   wager multiplied by the amount wagered per line.
                                              10245972_1 (GHMatters) P100870.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 21
   Such win lines are typically formed by a combination of
   symbol display positions, one from each reel, the symbol
   display positions being located relative to one another
   such that they form a line.
 5
   In many games, the gaming machine may award winning
   outcomes which are not strictly limited to the lines they
   have selected, for example, "scatter" pays are awarded
   independently of a player's selection of pay lines.
10
   Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, the player may selecting a number of reels to
   play. Games of this type are marketed under the trade name
   "Reel Power" by Aristocrat Leisure Industries Pty Ltd and
15 are also known as "ways" to win games. The selection of
   the reel means that each displayed symbol of the reel can
   be substituted for a symbol at one or more designated
   display positions. In other words, all symbols displayed
   at symbol display positions corresponding to a selected
20 reel can be used to form symbol combinations with symbols
   displayed at a designated, symbol display positions of the
   other reels. For example, if there are five reels and
   three symbol display positions for each reel such that the
   symbol display positions comprise three rows of five
25 symbol display positions, the symbols displayed in the
   centre row are used for non-selected reels. As a result,
   the total number of ways to win is determined by
   multiplying the number of active display positions of each
   reels, the active display positions being all display
30 positions of each selected reel and the designated display
   position of the non-selected reels. As a result for five
   reels and fifteen display positions there are 243 ways to
   win.
35 In the embodiment described below, the display positions
   of the symbol display are arranged in a rectangular matrix
   comprising a plurality of columns and a plurality of rows.
                                            10245972_1 (GHMatters) P100870.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 22
   However, other arrangements are known in the gaming
   industry and could be employed in embodiments of the
   invention. For example, in some arrangements there are
   more symbols in some columns than others, such as 3-4-3-4
 5 3 arrangement of seventeen display positions corresponding
   to respective ones of five reels. In such arrangements,
   the columns of four symbols can be arranged so that they
   are off-set or staggered relative to the columns having
   three symbols so that the middle two symbols in the
10 columns of four symbols share boundaries with two symbols
   of each neighbouring reel.
   In Figure 6, the processor 62 of game controller 60 is
   shown implementing a number of modules based on program
15 code and data stored in memory 64. Persons skilled in the
   art will appreciate that one or more of the modules could
   be implemented in some other way, for example by a
   dedicated circuit.
20 These modules include the outcome generator 622 which
   operates in response to the player's operation of game
   play mechanism 56 to place a wager and initiate a play of
   the game and generates a game outcome which will then be
   evaluated by award evaluator 623. In the embodiment, the
25 first part of forming the game outcome is for a symbol
   selector 622A to select symbols from a set of symbols
   specified by symbol data 641 using random number generator
   621. The selected symbols are advised to the display
   controller 624 which causes them to be displayed on
30 display 54 at a set of display positions.
   One example of selecting symbols is for the symbol
   selector 622A to select symbols for display from a
   plurality of symbol sets defining reel strips 641
35 corresponding to respective ones of a plurality of
   spinning reels. The reel strips 641 specify a sequence of
   symbols for each reel. In an embodiment, the symbol
                                            10245972_1 (GHMatters) P100870.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 23
   selector 622A selects the symbols for display by selecting
   a stopping position in the sequence. In one example, three
   symbols of each of five reels are displayed such that
   symbols are displayed at fifteen display positions on
 5 display 54. It is known to use a probability table stored
   in memory 64 to vary the odds of a particular stop
   position being selected. Other techniques can be used to
   control the odds of particular outcomes occurring to
   thereby control the return to player of the game.
10
   Once the symbols are selected, they are evaluated by
   outcome evaluator 623 which determines whether the
   selected symbols include any winning outcomes based on pay
   table 643.  If the selected symbols include one or more
15 winning outcomes, a win meter of meters 644 is updated
   with the value of the credit added to the meter being
   determined based on the pay table and the player's wager.
   That is, in accordance with the player's win entitlement.
   The outcome evaluator 63 also includes a trigger monitor
20 623A which determines whether the selected symbols meet
   one of the trigger conditions 646 stored in memory 64.
   In the embodiment, there are separate trigger conditions
   which result respectively in the award of a free game
25 series feature or a re-spin feature.
   When the trigger monitor 623A determines that the trigger
   condition 646 for the free games feature is met, the free
   games controller 625 initiates a series of free games.                       A
30 free game conducted by the game controller 60 involves a
   spin of the reels by the game controller for which a
   player does not place an additional wager.       As such, a
   free game can also be understood of as a game round of an
   overall game conducted by the gaming system upon which a
35 player has placed a wager.   That is, the single game can
   be made up of a number of separate game rounds.              Depending
   on the implementation, the reel strips used in the free
                                            10245972_1 (GHMatters) P100870.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 24
   games may be the same or different to those used in the
   base game.
   When the free games are started, the free games controller
 5 625 sets a counter 645 in memory and as the games are
   conducted, the counter is adjusted by counter adjuster
   625A of free game controller 625.   When all of the free
   games have been conducted (and hence the counter has
   reached zero) the series of free games ends.           During the
10 free games, the symbol selector 622A selects symbols for
   display on the display positions from each of the
   respective reels.  When the selected symbols include a
   designated symbol, which in an embodiment is a WILD symbol
   which can substitute for all other symbols, the designated
15 symbol is held for future games by symbol holder 622B
   which updates memory 64 to define the positions that are
   occupied by held symbols 642.
   In this respect, the embodiment departs from the
20 conventional operation of a gaming machine in which
   symbols are held.  In a conventional gaming machine where
   symbols are held symbols, new symbols are not selected by
   the gaming machine for the display position at which the
   held symbol is displayed.   In the embodiment, WILD symbols
25 which can substitute for other symbols can be retained or
   "held". After a symbol has been held, in a subsequent free
   game, the gaming system is configured so that a new symbol
   is selected for display at the symbol display position by
   symbol selector 622A and if a further WILD symbol is
30 selected for a symbol display position already occupied by
   a held WILD symbol, the held WILD symbol is modified (or
   "upgraded") by symbol modifier 622C incorporating a
   multiplier into the display of the held WILD symbol. For
   example, if a second WILD symbol lands at a position
35 occupied by a first WILD symbol, the symbol modifier 622C
   modifier modifies the display of the WILD symbol to
   indicate that it attracts a times two   ("x2") multiplier.

   When a third symbol lands at the same position, the symbol
   modifier 622C modifier modifies the display of the WILD
   symbol to indicate that it attracts a times three                 ("x3")
   multiplier.   In an embodiment, as described in further
 5 detail below, if a WILD symbol lands on a symbol which is
   already a x3 multiplier, the multiplier is not adjusted by
   the symbol modifier.   That is, in this embodiment, there
   is a cap on the value which a multiplier can reach.                    In
   other embodiments, there may not be a cap on the
10 multiplier.   In other embodiments, the multipliers can be
   modified in a different way provided at least some further
   occurrences of a designated symbol result in an increased
   multiplier.   For example, when a second designated symbol
   lands on a position occupied by a designated symbol, the
15 multiplier can be set to x3 and when a further multiplier
   lands, the multiplier can be set to x4.     In another
   example, the multiplier may change from x2 to x4.
   In each of the embodiments, the changes are implemented by
20 a symbol modifier 622C which updates the data associated
   with the relevant held symbols 642 to indicate the
   multiplier that currently applies.
   During each round of the free game series, the selected
25 symbols are evaluated by outcome evaluator 623 using pay
   table 643.   For each winning outcome, the award is
   multiplied by the multipliers associated with any WILD
   symbols that substitute as part of the winning outcome.
30 Figure 7 shows a flow chart of an embodiment of a method
   700 for conducting a free game series.    As indicated, at
   step 705 it is determined whether a scatter symbol
    ("SCAT") lands on each of reels 1, 2, and 3.          That is, the
   occurrence of scatter symbols on each of reels 1-3 is the
35 trigger condition.   The trigger monitor 623A causes the
   free game series to start.    The method then involves
   awarding a spin and indicating 710 to the player that free
                                             10245972_1 (GHMatters) P100870.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 26
   games have been triggered.   The method then involves
   changing the reels and pay tables 715 to apply during the
   free game series and starting the free games. At step 720,
   the method involves spinning the reels.    That is,
 5 selecting stopping positions using the random number
   generator 621 to determine the symbols that will appear at
   the symbol display positions corresponding to respective
   ones of the reels.  In this example, there are 5 reels.
   The method then involves a number of steps which can
1o result in a symbol being held, or a held symbol being
   modified.  At step 721, it is determined whether a WILD
   symbol has landed on an empty location.    For each location
   at which a WILD symbol has landed and which it is empty,
   the location of that WILD is saved as part of held symbol
15 642 and that symbol becomes a "sticky" WILD which will be
   retained at that symbol position in subsequent games of
   free games series.
   The method also involves determining 723 whether a WILD
20 has landed on another WILD symbol.   If it has, the WILD at
   that location is upgraded by the symbol modifier 622C to
   be a "WILD x2".  That is, a x2 multiplier is added to the
   WILD symbol.  Similarly, if a WILD lands 725 on a WILD x2,
   the WILD x2 symbol at that location is upgraded by the
25 symbol modifier 622C to a WILD x3 symbol 726.          Finally, in
   this embodiment, there is a cap on the size to which a
   WILD symbol can grow and hence if a WILD lands 727 on a
   WILD x3 symbol, nothing is done 728.
30 The method involves calculating 730 which win lines played
   by the player have winning outcomes taking into account
   the usual function of a WILD symbol as a substitute
   symbol.  Wins containing WILD x2 are multiplied by 2 for
   each WILD x2 symbol 730.  Wins containing WILD x3 are
35 multiplied by 3 for each WILD x3.   Independently of the
   wins on active win lines played by the player, it is
   determined whether there are any scatter wins 735.
                                            10245972_1 (GHMatters) P100870.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 27
   At step 740, it is determined by trigger monitor 623A
   whether a re-trigger has been awarded.  In this example,
   the re-trigger is the same as the original trigger
 5 requiring a SCAT symbol to land on reels 1, 2, 3.                 If a
   re-trigger has not previously been awarded and there is a
   scatter win, 5 additional free games are awarded 745.
   Thus, in this example, counter adjuster 625A updates the
   free games counter adjuster 625 by adding a further 5 free
10 games.  In this example, the re-trigger can only occur
   once. At step 750, it is determined whether this was the
   last free game (i.e. the counter has reached 0) and if so,
   the feature has ended.  Otherwise, the method continues by
   spinning the reels again 720 to conduct the next free
15 game.
   If the trigger condition determined by the trigger monitor
   623 from a game outcome is the re-spin feature, the re
   spin feature controller 626 controls the conduct of the
20 re-spin feature.  Unlike the free games feature, the re
   spin feature does not involve the conduct of a defined
   number of games but rather is conducted until an end
   condition is met. To this end, the re-spin feature
   controller 626 contains an end condition monitor 626A
25 which determines whether an end condition has been met in
   relation to the re-spin feature.  In this example, the end
   condition is that a re-spin of a subset of the reels does
   not result in the addition of an additional designated
   symbol to the displayed symbols as described in further
30 detail below.
   In this respect, when the re-spin feature is initiated,
   re-spin feature controller 626 causes the symbol selector
   622A to select symbols for all of the reels 621 and all of
35 the reels are initially displayed as spinning towards the
   stop positions selected by the symbol selector 622A in
   accordance with the technique described above.           A first
                                            10245972_1 (GHMatters) P100870.AU.2 15/05/18

                               - 28
   subset of the reels are displayed as continuing to spin
   while the second subset of reels are displayed as stopping
   at stop positions.   In one example, the first subset is
   reel 1 and the second subset is reels 2, 3, 4 and 5.                      If
 5 the selected symbols of the second subset include a
   designated symbol, again a WILD symbol, symbol holder 622B
   retains the symbol as a held symbol 642 for a further re
   spin.  In each re-spin, the symbol selector 622A selects
   symbols for the symbol positions of each of the reels of
10 the second subset of reels that are not already occupied
   by held symbols.   The process continues until the new
   symbol selected by the symbol selector 622A includes no
   further designated symbols.    At this point, the end
   condition monitor 626 determines that an end condition has
15 occurred in respect of the re-spin feature and causes the
   reels of the first subset to stop at the selected
   position. The symbols which are then displayed are
   evaluated by outcome evaluator 623 based on pay table 643
   to determine whether they include any winning outcomes on
20 active win lines and any awards are made by updating the
   win meter of meters 644.
   Figure 8 shows a flow chart 800 of a method of an
   embodiment of such a re-spin feature.    In Figure 8, it is
25 shown that the method involves determining whether a WILD
   symbol lands on reels 2, 3, 4 and 5.    This is the trigger
   condition for the re-spin feature game.     If a WILD symbol
   lands on those reels, the method involves the re-spin
   feature controller awarding the re-spin feature and
30 indicating to the player that a re-spin has triggered 820.
   The method then involves holding the triggering WILDS at
   the positions at which they were displayed, loading the
   reels that are used for the re-spin games as well as
   updating the pay table 643 to be the one used for a re
35 spin game 830.
   The method then involves starting spinning 840 all of the
                                             10245972_1 (GHMatters) P100870.AU.2 15/05/18

                              - 29
   reels under control of the symbol selector 322A.                At step
   850, the method involves stopping reels 2, 3, 4 and 5.                        It
   is then determined whether a WILD has landed in a position
   where there was previously no WILD. If the answer is Yes,
 5 the method involves holding 870 the additional WILDS and
   repeating the step 840 of spinning the reels in respect of
   reels 2, 3, 4 and 5.  If the answer is No, then the method
   involves stopping 880 reel 1.   That is, the method
   involves repeating the steps of spinning the reels of the
10 second subset (reels 2, 3, 4 and 5) until such time as no
   additional WILDS are held by symbol holder 622B at which
   time the first reel is stopped. The method then involves
   evaluating the selected symbols based on the pay table 643
   for the re-spin feature and making any awards by updating
15 the meters 644.
   In some embodiments, an eligibility criteria may be
   applied by the game controller 60 for the player to be
   eligible for the free game series game or the re-spin
20 feature, for example that the player has made a certain
   sized wager, made an ante bet, selected all win lines,
   played sufficient games, or the player is a member of a
   loyalty program.
25 The trigger event may be, a symbol combination in the
   game, occurrence of a specific symbol in the game,
   purchased, be caused by another connected system, based on
   turnover, based on a random evaluation, etc.
30 Typically, a winning outcome will result in some form of
   award being made such as an award of credits. Such an
   award may never actually be physically received by a
   player. For example, many gaming systems provide a player
   with a double or nothing gamble feature, where the player
35 can double or forfeit their credits before commencing
   another play of the game or cashing out. Further, as
   credits are fungible, once credits have been added to the
                                            10245972_1 (GHMatters) P100870.AU.2 15/05/18

                               - 30
   credit meter it is not possible to distinguish between
   credits which exist because the player has input cash or
   the like and credits resulting from an award.
 5 Further aspects of the method will be apparent from the
   above description of the system. It will be appreciated
   that at least part of the method will be implemented
   electronically, for example, digitally by a processor
   executing program code such as in the above description of
10 a game controller. In this respect, in the above
   description certain steps are described as being carried
   out by a processor of a gaming system, it will be
   appreciated that such steps will often require a number of
   sub-steps to be carried out for the steps to be
15 implemented electronically, for example due to hardware or
   programming limitations. For example, to carry out a step
   such as evaluating, determining or selecting, a processor
   may need to compute several values and compare those
   values.
20
   As indicated above, the method may be embodied in program
   code. The program code could be supplied in a number of
   ways, for example on a tangible computer readable storage
   medium, such as a disc or a memory device, e.g. an EEPROM,
25  (for example, that could replace part of memory 103) or as
   a data signal (for example, by transmitting it from a
   server).  Further different parts of the program code can
   be executed by different devices, for example in a client
   server relationship. Persons skilled in the art, will
30 appreciate that program code provides a series of
   instructions executable by the processor.
   It will be understood to persons skilled in the art of the
   invention that many modifications may be made without
35 departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, in
   particular it will be apparent that certain features of
   embodiments of the invention can be employed to form
