                         A RETAINING WALL ARRANGEMENT
         TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD
[001] This invention relates to a retaining wall arrangement and more particularly to
a unique and inventive arrangement which includes a multiplicity of stackable
modular blocks adapted for assembling into a series of vertical support columns
wherein the interlocking between said modular blocks ultimately in part is permanent
and achieved again at least in part due to the inherent structural configuration of the
modular blocks.
         BACKGROUND ART DISCUSSION
[002] Retaining walls are often used in landscaping around residential or
commercial buildings. Due to the nature of their application in retaining or walling in
a significant volume of ground material, they are often made of concrete structures
set in situ or walls formed of stacked sections of heavy masonry blocks set upon a
concrete foundation.
[003] Once a retaining wall reaches a particular height it will usually fall under the
requirements of local building codes, in that a constructed retaining wall must
withstand certain forces judged by the height of the wall, the overall mass of the wall
and the width or thickness of the wall at the base, with the mass being the most
critical.
[004] For these local building code requirements to be satisfied, as introduced
above, this will often require that the retaining wall arrangement include a concrete
based foundation.
[005] In many instances however, a retaining wall need not be of a substantial
height to fall under a regulated building code, wherein the wall for the most part
provides an aesthetic terracing and/or landscaping feature around a property, rather
than a structural re-enforcement to potentially movable ground material.
                                              1

[006] Nonetheless, without suitable material and methods of construction to be able
to assemble a retaining wall that lacks significant height most people are reluctant to
build such a retaining wall arrangement due to the cost, convenience, skill and
difficulties involved in using concrete masonry blocks and so forth upon a concrete
foundation.
[007] It would be advantageous if it was possible to provide a more simple, cost
saving, convenient and efficient modular building arrangement of assembling the
retaining wall which would allow the more DIY's, landscapers or not necessarily fully
skilled tradespersons, to be able to assemble together a retaining.
[008] Accordingly it is an object of this invention to provide a retaining wall
arrangement utilising a multiplicity of stackable interlocking modular blocks that will
be able to be handled conveniently, safely and without any significant skill whereby
these modular blocks are assembled into a series of vertical support columns
interlinked by way of intermediate lengths of stackable concrete sleepers.
[009] Further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from a
complete reading of the following specification.
         SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
[010] In one form of the invention there is a retaining wall arrangement, said
retaining wall arrangement including;
[011] a multiplicity of stackable interlockable modular blocks adapted for assembly
into a series of vertical support columns whereby said vertical support columns are
interlinked by way of intermediate lengths of stackable concrete sleepers;
[012] each stackable interlockable modular block including a protruding section and
a recess section so that when one modular block is stacked upon another the
protruding section and the recess section align, allowing the respective modular
blocks to be orientated vertically one to the other;
                                             2

[013] each stackable interlocking modular block having a central bore whereby
when the modular blocks are orientated vertically one upon the other in the assembly
of said vertical support column, said respective bore holes of each modular block
defines a passage for a stake to pass there through so as to fix the assembled
vertical support column with the ground;
[014] said defined passageway of the respective bore holes of each of the modular
blocks stacked within an assembled vertical support column further configured to
allow a slurry of concrete, binding material and/or other adhesive type composite to
be receivable there through said passage when said stake has fixed said vertical
column support with the ground such that on setting of said concrete, binding
material and/or other adhesive type composite, said stake becomes set in said
passageway thereby permanently interlocking the multiplicity of stackable
interlockable modular blocks within the vertical support column.
[015] In preference the retaining wall arrangement further includes a tie-back
arrangement adapted to reinforce the structural support strength of the vertical
support column, said tie-back arrangement including an intermediate link, wherein
the intermediate link includes a first section securable within a notch included within
the modular block and a second section of the intermediate link exposable from the
vertical support column, wherein the second section of the intermediate link is
engagable with a bracing arrangement.
[016] In preference the first section of the intermediate link of the tie-back
arrangement includes an aperture commensurate in dimensions and shape with the
bore hole of the modular block such that the first section of the intermediate link is
restable within said notch about a peripheral upper edge of the respective bore hole
of the modular block so as to allow the stake to be positionable within the aperture of
the first section of the intermediate link wherein the stake has been driven through
the passage defined in the vertical column support to fix the vertical support column
with the ground.
[017] In preference the bracing arrangement includes a column brace, wherein one
end of the column brace is adapted to hook and retainably engage with an aperture
                                             3

of the second section of the intermediate link and wherein another end of said
column brace is adapted to be fixably retained to a picket securable within the ground
at a distance from said vertical support column of the retaining wall arrangement.
[018] In preference the stackable interlockable modular block protruding section is at
the base of the modular block and the recess section of the modular block is at the
top of the modular block.
[019] In this embodiment the introduction of the protruding section at the base of the
modular block and the corresponding recess at the top of the modular block enables
a multiplicity of the interlockable modular blocks to be stackable one above the other
as the protruding section nests and rests in the recess section of the top part of the
modular block.
[020] In preference the protrusion section and the corresponding recess section of
the modular block are configured within the structure so that once the protruding
section rests within the corresponding recess of a vertically adjacent below modular
block, the respective bore holes of each modular block align to define the
passageway to which once the vertical support column is stacked to a preferred
height by placing one modular block one upon the other, the defined passageway
allows a stake to pass through each of the bore holes of the respective modular
blocks making up the vertical support column so as to then stake the vertical column
support with the ground.
[021] In preference each stackable interlockable modular block on opposing sides
includes aligned continuous slots whereby lengths of stackable concrete sleepers are
guidable and confinable therein.
[022] In preference the stackable interlockable modular block further includes a slot
running along a side at 900 to the opposing sides including the aligned longitudinal
slots.
[023] In alternative embodiments the slots are configured at a corner or corners of
the stackable interlockable modular block.
                                            4

[024] In preference the retaining wall arrangement further includes a base support
structure wherein the base support structure includes a recess to accept the
protruding section of a stackable interlockable modular block mounted thereon.
[025] In preference the retaining wall arrangement further includes a capping tile
configured to nest upon the top of the assembled vertical support column thereby
closing off the top of the stackable interlockable modular block stacked the highest
upon the vertical support column.
[026] In preference a corner or corners of the stackable interlockable modular block
are bevelled.
[027] In order now to describe the invention in greater detail a series of preferred
embodiments will be described with the assistance of the following illustrations and
accompanying text.

        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
[034] Figure 1 shows a perspective view of one of the stackable interlockable
modular blocks shown generally as (10).
[035] In the preferred embodiment each stackable interlockable modular block
includes on the two opposing sides (12), (14) longitudinal slots (16) and (18) which is
discussed in greater detail when referencing Figure 6, allows lengths of stackable
concrete sleepers (11) to be guided and confined in the respective slots (16) and (18)
when a series of stackable interlockable modular blocks have been assembled into
the series of vertical support columns referenced as (13) in Figure 6 and by which
one such vertical support column (13) is shown in cross-section and will be discussed
in greater detail when referencing Figure 5.
[036] In the stackable interlockable modular block (10) shown in Figure 1 there is a
further slot (20) at 900 to the respective slots (16) and (18), included so as to allow
greater variation in the way in which the adjacent vertical columns are aligned one
with respect to the other, and how the concrete sleepers are orientated.
[037] In the preferred embodiment the stackable interlockable modular block (10)
includes beveled edges (19).
[038] In Figure 6 reference (26) shows how a 900 arrangement can be made
available between adjacent vertical support columns (13) as opposed to just 1800.
[039] The stackable interlockable modular block (10) includes a recess section (20)
which is adapted to mate with the corresponding protruding section (24). As best
seen in Figure 5 when the stackable interlockable modular blocks are assembled one
atop the other, the protruding section (24) of the modular block (10) is able to nest
and rest within the recess section (22) at the top of the modular block (10) thereby
                                             6

appropriately aligning the modular blocks vertically one with the other as the requisite
vertical support column is being constructed.
[040] Importantly, the protruding section (24) and the corresponding recess section
(22) also allows the bore hole (28) of the modular block (10) to be aligned with the
corresponding bore hole (28) of another modular block (10) stacked above or below
when assembled into the vertical support column (13) as best seen in Figure 5.
[041] Advantageously, by including the central bore (28) inherently within the
structure of the modular block (10) and by confining the way in which one modular
block (10) can be stacked upon another modular block (10) through the protruding
section (24) and the recess section (22) allows each of the bore holes (28) to define
one continuous passage when the vertical column (13) is assembled.
[042] By having one defined vertical passage throughout the length of the
assembled vertical column support (13) allows a stake (30) to pass through the
series of bore holes (28) of the assembled vertical support column (13) to then
engage the vertical support column (13) with the ground (32).
[043] In the preferred embodiment shown in Figure 5 and also referenced in greater
detail in Figure 4, the retaining wall arrangement also includes the base support
structure (40).
[044] The base support structure (40) includes a top surface (41) which exposes the
recess (43) and also the defined bore hole (44) which once again allows for the most
immediate modular block (10) stacked upon the base support structure (40) to have
the corresponding protruding section (24) engage with that recess (43) of the base
support structure (40) so that the bore hole (44) of the base support structure (40)
also aligns with the defined passage which has been constructed from the
appropriately aligned bore holes (28) of each of the modular blocks (10) making up
the vertical column support (13).
[045] Figure 2 illustrates the intermediate link shown generally as (50).
                                             7

[046] The intermediate link (50) includes a first section (52) which is adapted to rest
within a notch (53) that acts as a skirt around the top edge of the circumferential rim
(55) of the bore hole (28) of the stackable interlockable modular block (10).
[047] The general circular shape shown as (54) rests within the notched rim (53)
and the aperture (55) included in the first section (52) of the intermediate link (50)
does not close off or hinder the opening to the bore hole (28) of the stackable
interlockable modular block (10) but rather this aperture (55) included as part of the
intermediate link (50) allows the stake (30) to be passed there through the aperture
(55) thereby providing a point of leverage for the bracing arrangement shown best in
Figures 3a and 3b and Figure 5.
[048] The bracing arrangement which includes the column brace (60) at one end
has a hook section (62) which is able to engage the aperture (58) of the second
section (51) of the intermediate link (50).
[049] At the other end of the brace column (60) there is another hook section (63)
that engages with the picket arrangement (65).
[050] In preference in constructing the retaining wall, the base support structure (40)
would be placed in the ground as required with the modular blocks (10) vertically
stacked one upon the other to which then preferably a steel stake (30) would be
placed there through the aligned bore holes (28) of each of the modular blocks (10)
to the finished height of the wall.
[051] The intermediate link (50) would be added at the required level to construct
the tie-back arrangement utilising the bracing arrangement referenced above.
[052] The inserted stake or picket (30) would be cut off at the top and then concrete
slurry poured through the centre passing through the gaps around the stake (30) to
set the stake (30) into place uniquely interlocking each one of the modular blocks
(10) into a single vertical support column (13) once the poured concrete slurry has
set.
                                             8

[053] Thereafter base plates and capping tiles can be placed on the vertical support
column by way of glue or the like.
[054] As best seen in Figure 6 a retaining wall can be uniquely constructed relying
upon the multiplicity of the stackable interlockable modular blocks (10).
[055] The assembling of the stackable interlockable modular blocks (10) into a
series of vertical support columns (13) allows the support columns (13) to be
interlinked by the intermediate lengths of stackable concrete sleepers (11) to enclose
the ground to which the retaining wall arrangement is structured thereabout.
