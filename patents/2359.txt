    [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/430,923, filed
    January 7, 2011, which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
  5                              BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
    [0002] Melanin in humans is the primary determinant of skin color. Melanin in skin is produced
    by melanocytes in the epidermis in response to environmental triggers, such as increased sun
    exposure, or other physical or chemical perturbation. Melanin is also found in hair, the
    pigmented tissue underlying the iris of the eye, as well as the stria vascularis of the inner ear.
 t0 [0003] Environmental and/or physiological stress can cause disorders in melanin production. For
    example, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation ("PIH") represents the sequelae of various
    cutaneous disorders, including infections, allergic reactions, mechanical injuries, reactions to
    medications, phototoxic eruptions, trauma (e.g., bums), inflammatory diseases (e.g., lichen
    planus, lupus erythematosus and atopic dermatitis), as well as reactions to devices, including
 [5 electromagnetic devices such as ultrasound, radiofrequency, lasers, light-emitting diodes and
    visible light therapy, as well as microdermabrasion reactions. PIH occurs widely in the human
    population and can be the source of significant psychosocial distress for those affected with this
    disorder. PIH is a pathophysiologic response to cutaneous inflammation. Melanocytes can be
    stimulated by the inflammatory process to synthesize and secrete more melanin from
 !o melanocytes, or the number of melanocytes can increase in the epidermis, leading to
    hyperpigmentation of the skin. PIH can also occur when inflammation disrupts the basal cell
    layer, causing melanin pigment to be released and subsequently trapped by macrophages in the
    papillary dermis. Hyperpigmentation or hypermelanosis disorders due to environmental
    stressors, such as hormonal imbalance, can also affect melanin or pigmentation levels in the skin.

  5 embodiments, a "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" may also be used in conjunction with
    cosmeceutically-acceptable compositions.
    [00197] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable cation" refers to a non toxic, acceptable cationic
    counter-ion of an acidic functional group.      Such cations are exemplified by sodium, potassium,
    calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium cations, and the like. In some
 t0 embodiments, a "pharmaceutically acceptable cation" may also be used in conjunction with
    cosmeceutically-acceptable compositions.
    [00198] "Pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient or carrier
    with which a disclosed compound is administered. In some embodiments, a "pharmaceutically
    acceptable vehicle" may also be used in conjunction with cosmetically-acceptable compositions.
 t5 [00199] "Preventing" or "prevention" refers to a reduction in risk of acquiring a disease or
    disorder (i.e., causing at least one of the clinical symptoms of the disease not to develop in a
    subject that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease but does not yet experience or
    display symptoms of the disease).
    [00200] "Prodrugs" refers to compounds, including derivatives of disclosed compounds, which
 !0 have cleavable groups and become by solvolysis or under physiological conditions of compounds
    which are pharmaceutically active in vivo. Such examples include, but are not limited to, choline
    ester derivatives and the like, N-alkylmorpholine esters and the like.
    [00201] "Solvate" refers to forms of the compound that are associated with a solvent, usually by
    a solvolysis reaction. Conventional solvents include water, ethanol, acetic acid and the like. The
25  compounds disclosed herein may be prepared e.g. in crystalline form and may be solvated or

    [00204] "Treating" or "treatment" of any disease or disorder refers, in one embodiment, to
    ameliorating the disease or disorder (i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the disease or
    at least one of the clinical symptoms thereof). In another embodiment "treating" or "treatment"
    refers to ameliorating at least one physical parameter, which may not be discernible by the
  5 subject. In yet another embodiment, "treating" or "treatment" refers to modulating the disease or
    disorder, either physically, (e.g., stabilization of a discernible symptom), physiologically, (e.g.,
    stabilization of a physical parameter), or both. In yet another embodiment, "treating" or
    "treatment" refers to delaying the onset of the disease or disorder, or even preventing the same.
    In a still further embodiment, "treating" or "treatment" refers to administration of the compound
 t0 or compositions disclosed herein for cosmetic purposes.
    [00205] Other derivatives of the disclosed compounds have activity in both their acid and acid
    derivative forms, but in the acid sensitive form often offers advantages of solubility, tissue
    compatibility, or delayed release in the mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of
    Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985). Prodrugs include acid derivatives such as,
 [5 for example, esters prepared by reaction of the parent acid with a suitable alcohol, or amides
    prepared by reaction of the parent acid compound with a substituted or unsubstituted amine, or
    acid anhydrides, or mixed anhydrides. Simple aliphatic or aromatic esters, amides and
    anhydrides derived from acidic groups pendant on the disclosed compounds are preferred
    prodrugs. In some cases it is desirable to prepare double ester type prodrugs such as
 !0 (acyloxy)alkyl esters or ((alkoxycarbonyl)oxy)alkylesters. Preferred are the C1 to C8 alkyl, C2
    C8 alkenyl, aryl, C7-C12 substituted aryl, and C7-C12 arylalkyl esters of the disclosed
    compounds herein.
    [00206] As used herein, the term "isotopic variant" refers to a compound that contains unnatural
    proportions of isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compound. For example, an
25  "isotopic variant" of a compound can contain one or more non-radioactive isotopes, such as for example,
    deuterium (2H or D), carbon-13 (13C), nitrogen-15 (15N), or the like. It will be understood that, in a
    compound where such isotopic substitution is made, the following atoms, where present, may vary, so that
    for example, any hydrogen may be 2H/D, any carbon may be 13C, or any nitrogen may be 15N, and that
    the presence and placement of such atoms may be determined within the skill of the art. Likewise, the
30  disclosed compounds may include the preparation of isotopic variants with radioisotopes, in the instance
    for example, where the resulting compounds may be used for drug and/or substrate tissue distribution
    studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. 3H, and carbon-14, i.e. 14C, are particularly useful
    for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Further,
    compounds may be prepared that are substituted with positron emitting isotopes, such as 1 IC,
                                                          -46-

        WO 2012/094638                                                            PCT/US2012/020550
    18F, 150 and 13N, and would be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for
    examining substrate receptor occupancy.
    [00207] All isotopic variants of the compounds provided herein, radioactive or not, are intended to be
    encompassed within the scope of the contemplated compounds.
  5 [00208] It is also to be understood that compounds that have the same molecular formula but
    differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in
    space are termed "isomers". Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are
    termed "stereoisomers".
    [00209] Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed "diastereomers" and
 to those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed "enantiomers". When
    a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair
    of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of
    its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or
    by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as
 [5 dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (-)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can
    exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof A mixture containing equal
    proportions of the enantiomers is called a "racemic mixture".
    [00210] "Tautomers" refer to compounds that are interchangeable forms of a particular
    compound structure, and that vary in the displacement of hydrogen atoms and electrons. Thus,
 !o two structures may be in equilibrium through the movement of 7 electrons and an atom (usually
    H). For example, enols and ketones are tautomers because they are rapidly interconverted by
    treatment with either acid or base. Another example of tautomerism is the aci- and nitro- forms
    of phenylnitromethane, that are likewise formed by treatment with acid or base.
    [00211] Tautomeric forms may be relevant to the attainment of the optimal chemical reactivity
25  and biological activity of a compound of interest.
    [00212] The disclosed compounds may possess one or more asymmetric centers; such
    compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)- stereoisomers or as mixtures
    thereof Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the
    specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and mixtures, racemic
30  or otherwise, thereof The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of
    stereoisomers are well-known in the art.
    [00213] Melanin Disorders
    [00214] As discussed above, melanin in humans is the primary determinant of skin color.
    Melanin pigments (eumelanin, pheomelanin and neuromelanin) are derivatives of the amino acid
                                                         -47-

        WO 2012/094638                                                           PCT/US2012/020550
    tyrosine, and production of melanin pigments is catalysed by the enzyme tyrosinase. Melanin is
    also found in hair, the pigmented tissue underlying the iris of the eye, as well as the stria
    vascularis of the inner ear. Melanin disorders can thus affect a variety of physiological systems,
    including the skin, hair, eye, inner ear, as well as neurological structures in the brain, where
  5 tissues with melanin include the medulla and zona reticularis of the adrenal gland, and pigment
    bearing neurons within areas of the brainstem, such as the locus coeruleus and the substantia
    nigra.
    [00215] Environmental and/or physiological stress can cause disorders in melanin production, as
    well as various genetic abnormalities. With regards to hypopigmentation disorders, there are
  0 approximately ten different types of oculocutaneous albinism, which is mostly an autosomal
    recessive disorder. Hypopigmentation occurs when pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) are
    either destroyed or inactive. Other hypopigmentation disorders include conditions due to skin
    damage (e.g. burn or ablative laser resurfacing) or due to autoimmune disease where the immune
    system attacks melanocytes, as in vitiligo. Vitiligo can also be caused by physical trauma or
 [5 certain diseases, such as Addison's disease or diabetes.
    [00216] Hyperpigmentation or hypermelanosis disorders result in an increase in melanin or
    melanocyte production and/or distribution. For example, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation
    ("PIH") represents the sequelae of various cutaneous disorders, including infections, allergic
    reactions, mechanical injuries, reactions to medications, phototoxic eruptions, trauma (e.g.
 !0 burns), as well as reactions to devices, including electromagnetic devices such as ultrasound,
    radiofrequency, lasers, light-emitting diodes and visible light therapy, as well as
    microdermabrasion reactions, shaving, chemical peels or other dermatological procedures. PIH
    occurs widely in the human population and can be the source of significant psychosocial distress
    for those affected with this disorder. PIH may occur as a pathophysiologic response to cutaneous
25  inflammation. Melanocytes can be stimulated by the inflammatory process to synthesize and
    secrete more melanin from melanocytes, or the number of melanocytes can increase in the
    epidermis, leading to hyperpigmentation of the skin. PIH can also occur when inflammation
    succeeds in disrupting the basal cell layer, causing melanin pigment to be released and
    subsequently trapped by macrophages in the papillary dermis. PIH also occurs in instances
30  where inflammation is untreated. One example of PIH as a result of inflammation is acne
    scarring. Hyperpigmentation or hypermelanosis disorders due to environmental stressors, such
    as hormonal imbalance, can also affect melanin or pigmentation levels in the skin. Other
    hyperpigmentation disorders include caf6 au lait macules, melasma, choasma, age spots, drug
    induced hyperpigmentation, Addison's disease, epheides (freckles), seborrheic keratosis,

    acanthosis nigricans, solar lentigines (sun spots), photoxic/photoallergic reaction,
    hemochromatosis and diabetic dermopathy.
    [00217] Current treatment of hyperpigmentation disorders include topical lightening agents,
    laser/intense pulsed light, cryotherapy and chemical peels. However, for many individuals,
  5 cosmetic camouflaging of hyper or hypopigmentation cutaneous manifestations is the only viable
    alternative. Effective treatment of hypo and hyperpigmentation disorders, therefore, is needed.
    [00218] The compositions disclosed herein seek to treat melanin disorders, including PIH and
    other hyperpigmentation disorders by modifying melanin distribution and/or production.
    [00219] The compositions disclosed herein also seek to treat melanin disorders in conjunction
 t0 with treatments and/or procedures that may cause hypermelanosis or hyperpigmentation
    disorders. Accordingly, the compositions disclosed herein may be used in conjunction with the
    treatment of skin disorders or trauma as a result of a mechanical injury or therapy, including but
    not limited to laser treatment, chemical peels, intense pulsed light, dermabrasion or cryotherapy.

    [00246] In one embodiment, the composition further comprises at least one film fomers. Suitable
    film fomers include, but are not limited to, polyacrylate-13, Opadry II@ or similar materials, e.g.,
    such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,802,924, incorporated herein by reference, may be
    used as a film former.
25  [00247] In yet other embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) is formulated for transdermal
    administration. Transdermal formulations may employ transdermal delivery devices and
    transdermal delivery patches and can be lipophilic emulsions or buffered, aqueous solutions,
    dissolved and/or dispersed in a polymer or an adhesive. In various embodiments, such patches
    are constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents. In
30  additional embodiments, the transdermal delivery of the compounds of Formula (I) is
    accomplished by means of iontophoretic patches and the like. In certain embodiments,
    transdermal patches provide controlled delivery of the compounds of Formula (I). The rate of
    absorption may be slowed by using rate-controlling membranes or by trapping the compound
    within a polymer matrix or gel. Alternatively, absorption enhancers are used to increase
                                                         -59-

        WO 2012/094638                                                            PCT/US2012/020550
    absorption. Absorption enhancers or carriers include absorbable pharmaceutically acceptable
    solvents that assist passage through the skin. For example, in one embodiment, transdermal
    devices are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the
    compound optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound
  5 to the skin of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and
    means to secure the device to the skin.
    [00248] Transdermal formulations described herein may be administered using a variety of
    devices which have been described in the art. For example, such devices include, but are not
    limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,598,122, 3,598,123, 3,710,795, 3,731,683, 3,742,951, 3,814,097,
 to 3,921,636, 3,972,995, 3,993,072, 3,993,073, 3,996,934, 4,031,894, 4,060,084, 4,069,307,
    4,077,407, 4,201,211, 4,230,105, 4,292,299, 4,292,303, 5,336,168, 5,665,378, 5,837,280,
    5,869,090, 6,923,983, 6,929,801 and 6,946,144.
    [00249] The transdermal dosage forms described herein may incorporate certain
    pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are conventional in the art. Transdermal drug
 [5 delivery systems are topically administered medicaments and may be in the form of patches that
    deliver drugs for systemic effects at a predetermined and controlled rate. The components of
    transdermal devices include: (1) polymer matrix or matrices, (2) the drug, (3) permeation
    enhancers and (4) other excipients.
    [00250] The polymer controls the release of the drug from the device. Useful polymers for
 !o transdermal devices include, but are not limited to Natural Polymers (e.g., Cellulose derivatives,
    Zein, Gelatin, Shellac, Waxes, Proteins, Gums and their derivatives, Natural rubber, Starch, etc.);
    Synthetic Elastomers (e.g., Polybutadieine, Hydrin rubber, Polysiloxane, Silicone rubber, Nitrile,
    Acrylonitrile, Butyl rubber, Styrenebutadieine rubber, Neoprene, etc.); and Synthetic Polymers
    (e.g., Polyvinyl alcohol, Polyvinyl chloride, Polyethylene, Polypropylene, Polyacrylate,
25  Polyamide, Polyurea, Polyvinylpyrrolidone, Polymethylmethacrylate, Epoxy, etc.)
    [00251] Solvents increase penetration possibly by enclosing the polar pathway and/or by
    fluidizing lipids. Examples include water alcohols (e.g., methanol and ethanol); alkyl methyl
    sulfoxides (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide, alkyl homologs of methyl sulfoxide dimethyl acetamide and
    dimethyl formamide); pyrrolidones (e.g., 2 pyrrolidone, N-methyl, 2-purrolidone); laurocapram
30  (Azone), miscellaneous solvents (e.g., propylene glycol, glycerol, silicone fluids, isopropyl
    palmitate).
    [00252] Surfactants may enhance polar pathway transport, especially of hydrophilic drugs. The
    ability of a surfactant to alter penetration is a function of the polar head group and the
    hydrocarbon chain length. Anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, Dioctyl
                                                         -60-

        WO 2012/094638                                                            PCT/US2012/020550
    sulphosuccinate, Sodium lauryl sulphate, and Decodecylmethyl sulphoxide. Nonionic surfactants
    include, but are not limited to, Pluronic F127, and Pluronic F68. Bile salts include, but are not
    limited to, Sodium ms taurocholate, Sodium deoxycholate, and Sodium tauroglycocholate.
    Others include, for example, Propylene glycol-oleic acid and 1, 4-butane diol-linoleic acid, urea,
  5 N, N-dimethyl-m-toluamide, calcium thioglycolat,; anticholinergic agents, eucalyptol, di-o
    methyl-3-cyclodextrin and soyabean casein.
    [00253] The fastening of all transdermal devices to the skin has so far been done by using a
    pressure sensitive adhesive which can be positioned on the face of the device or in the back of the
    device and extending peripherally. Adhesive systems should adhere to the skin aggressively, but
 t0 be easily removed. They should also not leave an unwashable residue on the skin, and they
    should not irritate or sensitize the skin.
    [00254] The face adhesive system should also be physically and chemically compatible with the
    drug, excipients and enhancers of the device of which it is a part. Permeation of drug should not
    be affected and the delivery of simple or blended permeation enhancers should not be affected.
 [5 [00255] Backing membranes are flexible and they provide a good bond to the drug reservoir,
    prevent drug from leaving the dosage form through the top, and accept printing. Backing
    membranes are impermeable substances that protect the product during use on the skin (e.g.,
    metallic plastic laminate, plastic backing with absorbent pad and occlusive base plate (aluminum
    foil), adhesive foam pad (flexible polyurethane) with occlusive base plate (aluminum foil disc),
 !0 etc.).
    [00256] In addition, transdermal formulations can include additional components such as, but not
    limited to, gelling agents, creams and ointment bases, and the like. In some embodiments, the
    transdermal formulation further includes a woven or non-woven backing material to enhance
    absorption and prevent the removal of the transdermal formulation from the skin. In other
25  embodiments, the transdermal formulations described herein maintain a saturated or
    supersaturated state to promote diffusion into the skin
    [00257] Compositions disclosed herein may be formulated in conventional manner using one or
    more pharmaceutically or cosmetically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries
    which facilitate processing of the substituted benzaldehydes and optional combination agents.
30  Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen and standard therapeutic
    practice. As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically or cosmetically acceptable carrier" means
    an inert, non toxic solid or liquid filler, diluent or encapsulating material, not reacting adversely
    with the active compound or with the subject. Suitable carriers are well known, and include
    water, saline, aqueous dextrose, sugar solutions, ethanol, glycols and oils, including those of
                                                         -61-

    petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil and
    mineral oil. In other embodiments, an agent or combination of agents of the instant embodiments
    can be formulated in an oleaginous hydrocarbon base, an anhydrous absorption base, a water-in
    oil absorption base, an oil-in-water water-removable base and/or a water-soluble base. Examples
  5 of such carriers and excipients include, but are not limited to, humectants (e.g., urea), glycols
    (e.g., propylene glycol), alcohols (e.g., ethanol), fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid), surfactants (e.g.,
    polysorbate-80, isopropyl myristate and sodium lauryl sulfate), pyrrolidones, glycerol
    monolaurate, sulfoxides, terpenes (e.g., menthol), amines, amides, alkanes, alkanols, water,
    calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and
 t0 polymers such as polyethylene glycols.
    [00258] Compositions can also contain adjuvants common to the cosmetic and dermatological
    fields, such as hydrophilic or lipophilic gelling agents, hydrophilic or lipophilic active agents,
    preserving agents, antioxidants, solvents, fragrances, fillers, sunscreens, odor-absorbers and
    dyestuffs. The amounts of these various adjuvants are those conventionally used in the fields
 [5 considered and, for example, are from about 0.01% to about 20% of the total weight of the
    composition. Depending on their nature, these adjuvants can be introduced into the fatty phase,
    into the aqueous phase and/or into the lipid vesicles.
    [00259] The compositions may be in the form of tablets, capsules, skin patches, inhalers, eye
    drops, nose drops, ear drops, suppositories, creams, ointments, injectables, hydrogels and into
 !o any other appropriate formulation known to one of skill in the art. For oral administration the
    pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by
    conventional means with acceptable excipients or carriers such as binding agents (e.g.,
    pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers
    (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g.,
25  magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolae);
    or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). Tablets may be coated using methods well
    known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example,
    solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with
    water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by
30  conventional means with acceptable excipients or carriers such as suspending agents (e.g.,
    sorbitol syrup cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin
    or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol or fractionated
    vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid).

    embodiment, a topical composition is provided which includes a topical carrier. For example,
    thickeners, diluents, emulsifiers, dispersing aids or binders may be used as needed. The topical
 to carrier is selected so as to provide the composition in the desired form, e.g., as a liquid, lotion,
    cream, paste, gel, powder, or ointment, and may be comprised of a material of either naturally
    occurring or synthetic origin. Examples of suitable topical carriers for use herein include water,
    alcohols and other nontoxic organic solvents, glycerin, mineral oil, silicone, petroleum jelly,
    lanolin, fatty acids, vegetable oils, parabens, aloe vera, waxes, and the like.
 [5 [00261] Ointments and creams can, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with
    the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions can be formulated with an

    [00264] In some embodiments, one function of the carrier is to enhance skin penetration of the
 [5 active ingredients. Permeation enhancers are compounds which promote skin permeability by
    altering the skin as a barrier to the flux of a desired penetrant. These may be classified as
    solvents, surfactants and miscellaneous chemicals. Suitable carriers are well known to skilled
    practitioners, and include liposomes, ethanol, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), petroleum jelly
    (petrolatum), mineral oil (liquid petrolatum), water, deimethylformamide, dekaoxyethylene
 !0 oleylether, oleic acid, 2-pyrrolidone, Azone@ brand penetration enhancer (Upjohn), biologically
    acceptable glycols, diglycols, polyglycols; alkyoxy C2-C8 alcohols, ethoxydiglycol and dimethyl
    isosorbide. A skin penetration enhancer may be included at concentrations ranging from 5% to
    95%, preferably 5% to 10% of the total composition.
    [00265] In a further embodiment of the combinations described above, a topical formulation is
25  prepared that comprises a composition for cosmetic or dermatological use, which composition
    comprises a cosmetically and/or dermatologically effective amount of the combination stated
    above.
    [00266] In one embodiment, the compositions are in a form suitable for cosmetic application
    including, but not limited to, lotions, ointments, creams, sprays, spritzes, aqueous or aqueous
30  alcoholic mixture gels, mousses, patches, pads, masks, moistened clothes, wipes, solid sticks,
    clear sticks, lip sticks, aerosol creams, anhydrous powders, tales, tonics, oils, emulsions or bath
    salts.
    [00267] In another embodiment, the composition also contains irritation-mitigating additives to
    minimize or eliminate the possibility of skin irritation or skin damage resulting from the chemical
                                                         -67-

    compound to be administered, or other components of the composition. Suitable irritation
    mitigating additives include for example: tocopherols, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., 2
    phenyl-1-ethanol), glycerin, salicylates, ascorbates (e.g., tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate), ionophores
    (e.g., monensin), amphiphilic amines, animonium chloride, N-acetylcysteine, capsaicin, and/or
  5 chloroquine.
    Modulation of Melanin Production
    [00268] In some embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein modulate melanin product in a
    subject in need thereof For example, the compositions disclosed herein may decrease melanin
    production to reduce pigmentation in a subject in need thereof The compositions disclosed
 to herein may also function to decrease the number of melanocytes present in the epidermis,
    effectively decreasing melanin production and reducing pigmentation in a subject in need
    thereof A decrease in melanin production may be desirable in the skin, hair, pigmented
    pigmented tissue underlying the iris of the eye, or the stria vascularis of the inner ear.
    Administration or targeting of the compositions disclosed herein may act to locally effect
 [5 melanin production and reduce pigmentation.
    [00269] Hyperpigmentation or hypermelanosis disorders due to environmental stressors, such as
    hormonal imbalance, can also affect melanin or pigmentation levels in the skin.
    Hyperpigmentation or hypermelanosis disorders may also be due to physiological stressors or
    mechanical stressors.
 !0 [00270] Prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) is a bioactive molecule in the prostanoid family of
    lipid mediators that regulate numerous processes in the body, including inflammation. While not
    wishing to be limited to a specific theory or mechanism of action, it is believed that the
    compositions disclosed herein may act in two (2) ways to modulate melanin distribution: 1)
    through the modulation of melanin production by melanocytes; and 2) by affecting melanin
25  distribution by melanocytes.
    [00271] 4-ethoxybenzaldehyde has been demonstrated to affect a wide variety of inflammatory
    conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, febrile conditions, edema, hyperalgesia, inflammatory
    bowel disease, and periodontal disease. However, 4-ethoxybenzaldehyde has not previously
    been shown to be useful in the treatment of hyperpigmentation, including post-inflammatory
30  hyperpigmentation, or to lighten skin.

    subject is queried if the treatment regimen is "satisfactory" or "unsatisfactory". Alternatively,
    the endpoint may be measured quantitatively in terms of the amount of melanin and/or
    melanocytes in a given subject or experimental procedure. The endpoint may be measured by a
    trained medical professional, for example a physician or nurse, or by a subject or other
 to individual. The endpoint may additionally be determined remotely, for example, through
    comparisons of photographs or other recordings by a trained medical professional or other
    individual. Furthermore, the degree of modification of melanin production may be
    predetermined by a trained medical professional, for example, by assigning a predetermined
    degree of melanin and/or melanocyte presence as an endpoint value.
 [5 [00314] The "effective amount", however, will take into account any toxicity effects that may
    occur, for example, severe skin irritation with higher doses of the active agents disclosed herein.
    Suggested endpoints may first be measured in vitro or in an animal model to determine the
    acceptable range of active agents to be used in conjunction with the compositions disclosed
    herein. One of ordinary skill in the art can then extrapolate doses that will avoid toxicity but
 !o maintain efficacy in treated subjects, including humans. The "effective amount" can vary
    depending on the compound, the disease and its severity, and the age, weight, etc., of the subject
    to be treated.

    Examples
  5 Example 1: Inhibition of Prostaglandin F2 alpha Levels
    [00339] Human keratinocytes were harvested and exposed to with UVB light to induce PGF2
    alpha release. Following exposure to UVB irradiation, the cells were treated with a composition
    comprising 1% 4-ethoxybenzaldehyde, Indomethacin (positive control) or left untreated
    (negative control). After 24 hours post-treatment, PGF2 alpha levels were measured by ELISA
 to analysis. The composition comprising 4-ethoxybenzaldehyde provided dose-dependent
    inhibition of PGF2 alpha in UVB-induced cells (Figure 1).
    Example 2: Skin Tone Clinical Study
    [00340] Approximately 30 healthy subjects, aged 20-64 years with Fitzpatrick Skin Types I-III,
    are enrolled in this single-center, double-blinded comparison study. Assignments of the test
 [5 product or vehicle to subjects are randomized 2:1 to avoid bias. A total of approximately 15
    subjects receive the test product and 15 subjects receive the vehicle. Subjects follow a twice
    daily product application regiment for 4 weeks. No other moisturizers, lotions or products are
    allowed to be applied during the study. At the baseline visit, subjects are graded by a
    dermatologist for uneven skin tone on their facial skin. Standardized digital photographs of the
 !o test site (i.e., face) are also taken. At the end of week 2, subjects are graded by a dermatologist
    for uneven skin tone on their facial skin. Standardized digital photographs of the test site (i.e.,
    face) are also taken. Twice-daily application of test product continues for another 14 days. At the
    end of 4 weeks, subjects are graded by a dermatologist for uneven skin tone on their facial skin.
    Standardized digital photographs of the test site (i.e., face) are also taken.
25  Example 3: Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation Clinical Study
    [00341] UV irradiation stimulates a variety of biochemical pathways in the skin, resulting in free
    radical formation as well as the release of inflammatory mediators. The short-term clinical effects
    observed from these pathways, include cutaneous inflammation and erythema, while long-term
    effects (for example, in the absence of treatment of the inflammatory response) result in
30  photodamaged skin. UV irradiation may also cause the development of post-inflammatory
    hyperpigmentation since it induces an inflammatory response in the skin that can proceed to
    hyperpigmentation.

    [00342] The 17 healthy female subjects, aged 26-63 years with Fitzpatrick Skin Types III-IV,
    were enrolled and completed this single-center, double-blinded comparison study. At baseline,
    test areas were marked onto the backs of the subjects: Untreated control, 1% w 4EB composition,
    antioxidant product, and other test products. Assignments of the test products to test areas were
  5 randomized to avoid site bias. The minimal erythemal dose (MED) for each subject was also
    determined, using a solar simulator with a spectral output comparable to that of natural solar
    radiation (UVB: 290-320 nm, UVA: 320-400nm). Thirty micro liters of each test product were
    applied to the respective test sites by the study staff, once daily, for 4 days. On Day 5, test sites
    were irradiated with 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 MEDs. On Day 6, standardized digital photographs
 t0 were taken of the test sites and test product application resumed for an additional eleven days.
    Standardized digital photographs were taken of the test sites on Day 20. The images were
    analyzed using a computer-aided colorimetry algorithm, according to the CIE color standard, to
    determine a* (redness) on Day 6 and L* (brightness) on Day 20.
    [00343] Both the 1% 4EB product and the antioxidant product provided statistically significant
 [5 protection from UV-induced erythema and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation when
    compared to untreated control (all P<0.01). The 1% w 4EB composition provided significantly
    higher protection than the antioxidant product from UV-induced post-inflammatory
    hyperpigmentation (all P<0.0001, Figure 2). The results from this clinical study suggest that
    topical 1% 4EB provides significant protection from UV-induced post-inflammatory
 !0 hyperpigmentation when compared to the antioxidant product. The 1% w 4EB product provided
    a statistically significant reduction in hyperpigmentation (Figure 3) and increase in skin
    brightness (Figure 4) when compared to the untreated control sample and the other test products
    (all P<0.000 1).
    [00344] Results from this clinical study suggest that topical 1% 4EB may provide significant
25  short-term and long-term protection from UV-induced post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
    The results depicted in Figure 3 from the clinical study suggest that topical 1% 4EB provides a
    statistically significant reduction in hyperpigmentation when compared to the untreated control
    sample and the other test products (all P<0.0001). Additionally, as seen in Figure 4, the 1% 4EB
    product provided a statistically significant increase in skin brightness when compared to the other
30  test products (all P<0.0001).

    Example 13: Half-face study to assess the efficacy and tolerance of four topical products in
    the treatment of facial hyperpigmentation
 to          1.0     BACKGROUND
    [00354] Hyperpigmentation is an increase in pigmentation or color of the skin that is abnormally
    dark. Hyperpigmentation occurs when an excess amount of melanin is produced. Causes of
    hyperpigmentation include sun exposure, certain medications, hormonal changes, PIH (post
    inflammatory hyperpigmentation) or a congenital pigmentation disorder. Hyperpigmentation
 [5 results in uneven skin color (tone) and a photoaged appearance. Dyspigmentation is identified as
    an abnormality in the formation or distribution of pigment, especially in the skin.
             2.0     PURPOSE
    [00355] This controlled clinical usage study will be conducted to evaluate and compare the
    tolerance and efficacy of four topical products designed to treat facial hyperpigmentation when
 !o used by females with moderate to severe dyspigmentation on the face.
    [00356] Evaluations of efficacy will be made using clinical grading, Chroma Meter
    measurements, digital photography, and self-assessment questionnaires. Tolerance will be
    evaluated by clinical grading of objective irritation, subject assessment of subjective sensations,
    and monitoring of adverse events and reactions.
25           3.0     ASSESSMENTS
    [00357] The topical treatments will produce statistically significant improvements in clinical
    grading scores for efficacy parameters and have statistically non-significant changes objective
    irritation assessments after 12 weeks of use compared to baseline.

                     9.3    Chroma Meter Measurements
    [00411] The Minolta Chroma Meter CR-400, in conjunction with a computer, is used to
    instrumentally assess skin color. The following values are recorded:
         L*       Values describe the relative brightness on a gray scale from black to white; scores
                  increase as the skin tone becomes brighter
         a*       Values describe the color hue ranging from red to green; scores increase with
                  vascularization or blood flow
         b*       Values describe the color hue ranging from blue to yellow; scores increase with the
                  amount of melanin in the skin
    [00412] Chroma Meter measurements are performed at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12. A
  5 single measurement is taken on the right and left sides of each subject's face on a hyperpigmented
    area selected by the expert grader. The location is recorded on a facial diagram to ensure
    consistency in measurement location at each visit.
                     9.4    Digital Photography
    [00413] Digital photography using a Nikon camera (Canfield VISIA-CR Camera System) is
 t0 performed at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12, to document visible changes in facial
    hyperpigmentation. For each subject, a full-face image is taken of the right and left sides of the
    face (2 images per subject) with standard and cross-polarized lighting/filter conditions. The focus
    revolves around the brown channel images (derived from the cross-polarized images) and the
    standard lighting photos.
 [5 [00414] Photos taken at weeks 4, 8 and 12 arecompared to the baseline photo to ensure consistent
    focus, lighting, placement and color. At each photography visit, color standards are photographed
    prior to beginning each day's photography.
                     9.5     Self-Assessment Questionnaires
    [00415] At baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12, subjects will complete a self-assessment
20  questionnaire regarding various skin condition parameters on the right and left sides of the face.
             10.0    ADVERSE EVENTS
                     10.1   Definition of an Adverse Event
    [00416] An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation
    where a subject is administered a pharmaceutical product/biologic (at any dose), OTC, cosmetic
25  product or medical device and which does not necessarily require a causal relationship with a test
    article. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal
    laboratory finding, for example), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a
    medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Adverse events

                     10.2     Assessment of Severity and Relationship
     [00417] The investigator or his medical staff will evaluate all adverse events as to their severity
    and relation to the test article. The severity of adverse events will be graded as follows:
        Mild:         Awareness of a sign or symptom but easily tolerated
        Moderate:     Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with usual activity or to affect
                      clinical status
        Severe:       Incapacitating with inability to do usual activity or to significantly affect clinical
                      status
     [00418] Assessment of Causality: the Investigator and/or trained staff member will also assess
  5 the relationship of any adverse event to the use of the study article, based upon available
    information, using the following guidelines:
        0      Unlikely      No temporal association, or the cause of the event has been identified, or
                             the test article cannot be implicated
        1       Possible     Temporal association, but other etiologies are likely to be the cause;
                             however, involvement of the test article cannot be excluded
        2      Probable      Temporal association, other etiologies are possible, but not likely
        3       Definite     Clear-cut temporal association
                     10.3     Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
     [00419] A serious adverse event is any experience or reaction occurring at any dose that results in
    any of the following outcomes: death, is life threatening, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation
 t0 of hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth
    defect.
     [00420] Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require
    hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical
    judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical
15  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. The term "life-threatening"
    refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to
    an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.
     [00421] Hospitalization solely for the purpose of diagnostic tests, even if related to an adverse
    event, elective hospitalization for an intervention which was already planned before the inclusion
20  of the subject in the study, and admission to a day-care facility may not themselves constitute
    sufficient grounds to be considered as a serious adverse event. Hospitalization is defined as being
    admitted to a hospital as an in-patient for greater than 24 hours.
                                                         -105-

        WO 2012/094638                                                           PCT/US2012/020550
                     10.4    Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events
    [00422] At each visit, the subjects are questioned about adverse events using an open question
    (e.g., "Have you noticed any change in your health since the last visit?").
    [00423] Directed questioning and examination will be performed when appropriate. All reported
  5 adverse events are documented on the appropriate forms without omitting any requested and
    known information. Every time a concomitant therapy is reported during the study, an Adverse
    Event Form will be completed if appropriate and the reason for the treatment noted.
    [00424] When an adverse event persists at the end of the study, the investigator conducts a
    follow-up of the subject until the event is satisfactorily resolved.
 to [00425] All adverse events are recorded by the Investigator onto the Adverse Event page of the
    source documents describing the adverse event, onset and stop date, severity, opinion of
    causality, the course of action taken, if any, as well as any pertinent data necessary to allow a
    complete evaluation of the adverse event. For serious adverse events, an additional report (SAE
    Report Form) is completed.
 [5                  10.5    Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events
    [00426] Any serious adverse event that occurs during the study whether related to the treatment
    or not, expected or not, is reported.
                     10.6    Unanticipated Adverse Events
    [00427] Unanticipated adverse effect is defined as any serious adverse effect on health or safety,
 !o any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the test article if that effect,
    problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the
    application; or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with the test article that relates
    to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.
                     10.7    Anticipated Reactions
25  [00428] The test material when applied to the face may produce mild to moderate, transient
    erythema, dryness, burning, stinging and/or itching. The responses discussed above will not be
    treated as adverse reactions. These conditions may or may not resolve over time. Symptoms that
    are persistent and moderate to severe in nature, or that involve elevation (e.g., edema, papules,
    vesicles, spreading) are considered adverse events (AEs).
30           11.0    BIOSTATISTICS AND DATA MANAGEMENT
                     Statistical Analysis
    [00429] The per protocol (PP) population is the primary population for efficacy and tolerance
    testing. The PP population includes all subjects who were randomized and completed all study
    procedures. Clinical grading scores and Chroma Meter measurement values at week 4, week 8,

    and week 12 are compared to baseline scores/values using a paired t-test. The average percent
    change from baseline is calculated for all parameters at each post-baseline time point.
    Comparisons among the three test materials are performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA)
    with paired comparisons using Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD). All differences are
  5 considered to be statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level.
    [00430] Subject Self-assessment questionnaires regarding skin condition parameters completed
    by subjects at all visits are analyzed using descriptive statistics presenting the percentages for
    each question.
                     Data Management
 to [00431] Clinical grading and Chroma Meter measurements are performed using electronic data
    capture system (EDC) which documents the identity of the evaluator as well as the time and date
    of all entries, or all corrected entries.
    [00432] The electronic data capture system (EDC) is a computerized system designed for the
    collection of clinical data in electronic format. The 3 major aspects of EDC are a graphical user
 [5 interface for data entry, a validation component to check for user data and a reporting tool for
    analysis of the collected data. Statistical analyses are performed using SAS software version 9
    series (SAS Statistical Institute).
    [00433] The self-assessment questionnaires are completed by subjects electronically using
    HIPAA compliant Zoomerang online survey software.
 !0 [00434] Data review and analyses is performed by an independent data committee. The data
    committee will consist of selected representatives from clinical services, quality assurance and
    the statistical department.
             12.0    RESULTS
    [00435] Figures 7, 8 and 9 provide the results from this study. Overall, 4% hydriquinone and
25  Base + 0.5% 4EB both significantly reduced hyperpigmentation compared to baseline for every
    time point (See Figure 7).
    [00436] Figure 8 illustrates the overall level of hyperpigmentation as a change from baseline.
    Sites treated with 4% hydriquinone and Base + 0.5% 4EB demonstrated comparable distribution
    of results in individuals.
30  [00437] Figure 9 provides the results of the patient self-assessment questionnaires. Better subject
    preference was observed with treatment with Base + 0.5% 4EB than with 4% Hydroquinone.

                    5.3     Method of Treatment Assignment
    [004451                  Subjects are numbered sequentially in the order in which they qualify for
    entry into the study.
    [00446] Prior to the start of the study, the biostatistics department generates a randomization
  5 based on a site rotational basis to avoid skin site bias. The irradiated, untreated site is to be
    included in the randomization assignment.
                    UV Radiation
    [00447] UV radiation is supplied by an artificial source, which has a spectral output in the
    ultraviolet range comparable to that of the natural solar spectrum (UVB: 290-320 nm and UVA:
 to 320-400 nm). The artificial light source used complies with the source spectral specifications as
    described in published testing guidelines. UV irradiation is performed with a single port solar
    simulator (Model 16S, Solar UV Simulator, Solar Light Co., Philadelphia) with a 150 watt xenon
    arc lamp. UVB + UVA radiation is obtained by using a combination of the UG-1 1/1mm and
    WG-320 filters (Schott Glass Technologies) that are placed in the radiation path of the solar
 [5 simulator.
    [00448] An adjustable patient stop is used to keep the distance from solar simulator to the
    radiated surface constant. At a distance of approximately 6.5 cm from the lamp housing, the
    radiated surface is exposed to a 1.0 cm diameter spot of UVA/UVB light. Exposures are
    performed by varying the time of exposure (in seconds) while keeping the energy level constant.
 !0 Opening and closing of the light shutter is performed manually. The radiation output of the xenon
    bulb is measured using the 3D-600 meter (Solar Light Co.). If a different radiometer is used for
    determination of radiation output, then a description of the model and accessories is included in
    the report. The xenon arc lamp is ignited and left on for at least 10 minutes prior to use in the
    study. Measurements are taken after lamp warm-up.
25                  5.4     Product Application
    [00449] Thirty (30) microliters (gl) of each test material is applied to designated sites using an
    open application technique with rubbing.
    [00450] One irradiated, untreated site does not receive product application.

            8.0     CONDUCT OF STUDY
                    8.1     Visit 1: Baseline: Day 1
 5 [00458] Individuals are given an informed consent (IC) document to read. They have all of their
   study related questions answered by the Investigator or his/her designated staff and if they agree,
   they sign two copies of the IC.
   [00459] Subjects complete a health and eligibility questionnaire, a confidentiality agreement
   photographic release form, and a HIPAA release form.
10 [00460] The Investigator or his/her designated staff examine the back (test site area) for evenness
   of skin tone (Fitzpatrick skin type III only) and to ensure the lack of uneven suntan, sunburn,
   scars, birthmarks, moles, vitiligo, keloids, skin abnormalities, or any other dermal markings.
   [00461] Eligible individuals are enrolled into the study and assigned a subject number.
   [00462] Subjects receive 5-7 irradiation exposures expressed as J/sq cm (adjusted to the erythema
15 action spectrum) on adjacent unprotected skin sites on the lower back. Each exposure represents
   a 25% increase in energy over the previous exposure.
   [00463] Seven (7) 3.0 cm x 5.0 cm areas are marked on the lower back.
                    8.2     Visit 2: Day 2
   [00464] 1. Test sites from Visit 1 areexamined using either a tungsten or warm white fluorescent
20 light that provides 450 to 550 lux of illumination.

    [00465] 2. Sites are scored for erythema using the scale outlined in section 9.1 for MED
    Determination.
    [00466] 3. Using the determined MED value, UVR exposures are calculated. The amount of
    UVR delivered to each subject's test sites depends on this value.
  5 [00467] 4. Each area is exposed to UVR in doses of 1.OX, 1.5X and 2.OX and 2.5X the
    previously determined MED.
    [00468] 5. Subjects have a rest period of 5 days while tanning develops at the irradiated sites.
    Subjects resume study procedures on Day 8.

                     ++    erythema, with or without edema
                           present
    [00474] The site receiving the lowest dose of combined UV that produced mild redness reaching
    the borders of the site will receive a score of +, and will be recorded as the MED (US) for that
25  subject.
    [00475] Each subject's MED may be different, but will likely be approximately 70 mJ/cm2. The
    intensity of UVR delivered to each subject's test sites depends on this value.
                    9.2     Chromameter Measurements
    [00476] The Minolta Chroma Meter CR-400, in conjunction with a computer, is used to assess
30  skin color. L* values describe the relative brightness on a gray scale from black to white, and
                                                       -113-

   scores increase as the skin tone becomes brighter/lighter. b* values describe the color hue
   ranging from blue to yellow and scores increase with the amount of melanin in the skin. One
   measurement is taken at each of the six treated sites and the untreated irradiated control site.
                   9.3      Imaging Procedures
 5 [00477] Digital photography is performed on the six treated sites and the untreated irradiated
   control site using a Nikon D300 camera and Micro Nikkor lens. Test and control sites are clearly
   labeled for each individual, and color standards are visible in each subject's photograph. Images
   are saved as raw data (NEF files) and also as JPEG files, arranged by subject. Photographs are
   analyzed for colorimetry using Image Pro Analysis software.
 0          10.0   ADVERSE EVENTS
                    10.1    Definition of an Adverse Event
   [00478] An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation
   where a subject is administered a pharmaceutical product/biologic (at any dose), OTC, cosmetic
   product or medical device and which does not necessarily require a causal relationship with a test
 5 article. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal
   laboratory finding, for example), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a
   medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
                    10.2    Assessment of Severity and Relationship
   [00479] The investigator or his/her medical staff evaluates all adverse events as to their severity
!0 and relation to the test article. The severity of adverse events is graded as follows:
     Mild          Awareness of a sign or symptom but easily tolerated
     Moderate      Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with usual activity or to affect
                   clinical status
      Severe       Incapacitating with inability to do usual activity or to significantly affect
                   clinical status
   [00480] The Investigator and/or trained staff member also assesses the relationship of any
   adverse event to the use of the study article, based upon available information, using the
   following guidelines:
     0      Unlikely     No temporal association, or the cause of the event has been identified, or
                         the test article cannot be implicated
      1     Possible     Temporal association, but other etiologies are likely to be the cause;
                         however, involvement of the test article cannot be excluded
     2      Probable     Temporal association, other etiologies are possible, but not likely
     3      Definite     Clear-cut temporal association
                                                       -114-

        WO 2012/094638                                                            PCT/US2012/020550
                     10.3    Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
     [00481] A serious adverse event is any experience or reaction occurring at any dose that results in
    any of the following outcomes: death; is life threatening; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation
    of hospitalization; a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or a congenital anomaly/birth
  5 defect.
     [00482] Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require
    hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical
    judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical
    intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. The term "life-threatening"
 t0 refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to
    an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.
     [00483] Hospitalization solely for the purpose of diagnostic tests, even if related to an adverse
    event, elective hospitalization for an intervention which was already planned before the inclusion
    of the subject in the study, and admission to a day-care facility may not themselves constitute
 [5 sufficient grounds to be considered as a serious adverse event. Hospitalization is defined as being
    admitted to a hospital as an in-patient for greater than 24 hours.
                     10.4    Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events
     [00484] At each visit, the subject is questioned about adverse events using an open question (e.g.,
    "Have you noticed any change in your health since the last visit?").
 !0  [00485] Directed questioning and examination is performed when appropriate. All reported
    adverse events are documented on the appropriate forms without omitting any requested and
    known information.
     [00486] Every time a concomitant therapy is reported during the study, an Adverse Event Form
    is completed if appropriate and the reason for the treatment noted.
25   [00487] When an adverse event persists at the end of the study, follow-up of the subject is
    conducted until the event is satisfactorily resolved.
                     10.5    Unanticipated Adverse Events
     [00488] Unanticipated adverse effect is defined as any serious adverse effect on health or safety,
    any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the test article if that effect,
30  problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the
    application; or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with the test article that relates
    to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.
                                                       -115-

         WO 2012/094638                                                           PCT/US2012/020550
                     10.6     Anticipated Reactions
      [00489] The test material when applied to the skin may produce mild irritation such as erythema,
     tanning, scaling/dryness, burning and/or stinging at the test site or surrounding the test sites. The
     responses discussed above will not be treated as adverse reactions. If sites begin to show mild
 5   levels of erythema, then product applications may be skipped as needed in order to avoid redness,
     which would interfere in the assessment of product efficacy. The UV exposure will create
     sunburn and possible discomfort. Hypo- or hyperpigmentation may occur at the skin sites, and
     the skin may show irritation where test material or vehicle is applied. These conditions may or
     may not resolve over time. Symptoms that are persistent and moderate to severe in nature, or that
 0   involve elevation (e.g., edema, papules, vesicles, spreading) will be considered adverse events
     (AEs).
             11.0    BIOSTATISTICS AND DATA MANAGEMENT
      [00490] Digital photographs will be taken of the entire treatment and control areas under
     standardized conditions. Images will be analyzed via a computer-aided colorimetry algorithm to
 5   determine L* values and b* values. The L* values of the treated areas and untreated areas from
     the images and Chromameter measurements will be compared to provide a "Skin Lightening
     Factor."
      [00491] The "L*and b' colorimeter values are expected to be different between the test material
     treated and untreated, irradiated area. Since each patient will serve as his own control, p-values
!0   will be determined by the two-tailed Student t-test.
