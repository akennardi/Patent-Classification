                                            ABSTRACT
Systems and methods for transporting seawater from a seawater source to an inland
site for utilization as a drilling and/or fracturing fluid are disclosed. In an aspect, systems
and methods are disclosed wherein seawater is extracted from an ocean at a coastal
location and transported to an inland drilling and hydraulic fracturing site via a railway
based transportation system, thereby providing a consistent, large volume supply of
seawater for use in drilling and/or hydraulic fracturing operations. Such systems and
methods       may eliminate      usage of locally-sourced fresh water, eliminating           the
unsustainable burden that drilling and hydraulic fracturing places on local water tables.

                                FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
[0004]         The present disclosure generally relates to hydrocarbon           extraction
processes and more particularly to systems and methods for utilizing seawater in drilling
and hydraulic fracturing processes.
                                      BACKGROUND
[0005]         The statements in this section merely provide background information
related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.
[0006]          Hydraulic fracturing processes are used to, among other things, extract
subterranean oil. These processes require significant amounts of water to operate. A
single oil or gas well may require three to thirteen million gallons of water. Land-based
hydraulic fracturing sites currently utilize locally-sourced fresh water, placing an
enormous, unsustainable strain on the local water table.
                                             1

[0007]         Currently, areas of significant drilling, such as Texas, have devoted as
much as ten percent of local fresh water usage to drilling and hydraulic fracturing
operations. According to the Texas Water Development Board and the Railroad
Commission of Texas, the State's oil and gas regulator, in 2011, Texas used a greater
number of barrels of water for oil and natural gas fracking (approximately 632 million)
than the number of barrels of oil produced (approximately 441                   million). Water
consumption is expected to rise as drilling operations expand. For example, by 2035,
the U.S. Energy Information Administration expects nearly 80% of the 21 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas produced annually to be from "unconventional" sources such as
hydraulically fractured      shale.  Furthermore,    such    processes stress arid,       fragile
ecosystems because many of the most oil-rich portions of the United States (e.g., Eagle
Ford Shale and the Permian Basin) are the driest. Some average less than 21 inches of
rainfall a year. The current rate of land-based hydraulic fracturing, notwithstanding
projected growth, cannot be sustained using fresh water alone.
[0008]         Hydraulic fracturing processes, also known as "fracking," "fracing," or
"fraccing," are used to release hydrocarbons and other substances contained in
subterranean rock formations via high pressure injection of a fracturing fluid, such as
fresh water, into the rock formation.
[0009]         In recent years, hydraulic fracturing has been widely used to access
previously unreachable deposits of oil and natural gas. As of 2010, 60% of all new oil
and gas wells worldwide were created using hydraulic fracturing. Because vast amounts
of formerly inaccessible oil and gas can be extracted using hydraulic fracturing, it is
likely that usage of such processes will increase in the future.
[0010]         The fracturing fluid comprises water and low concentrations of chemical
additives, depending on the characteristics of the water and the rock formation being
fractured. For example, the fracturing fluid may comprise so-called slickwater additives,
adapted to reduce friction, allowing the fracturing fluid to be pumped into the fracture at
a higher rate than if water alone were used. Slickwater additives typically make up less
than two percent of the fracturing fluid and must be adjusted for each rock formation or
"play." Borate salts and potassium chloride (a metal halide salt commonly used as a
substitute for table salt) are also common fracturing fluid additives.
[0011]         After injection, a portion of the fracturing fluid returns to the surface. Such
returning fluid is known as "produced water." Produced water, generated from hydraulic
fracturing or normal production of oil and gas wells, typically has a higher concentration
                                                2

of salt, other compounds, elements, and impurities. Produced water may be re-used in
the hydraulic fracturing process, however only 40-50% of initially-injected fracturing fluid
returns to the surface. Therefore, additional fracturing fluid must be continually added
even when produced water is reused. Because of its heavy salinity and impurity
concentration, produced water must be removed, cleaned, or reused. Most often,
produced water is re-injected into disposal wells or re-injected into injection wells used
to maintain the reservoir pressure.
[0012]         Hydraulic fracturing has been used to create offshore oil wells. For
example, large hydraulic fracturing vessels have been employed to open wells in the
North Sea, the Arabian Sea, off the western coast of Africa and off the Unites States
Gulf Coast. Initially, offshore hydraulic fracturing processes used fracturing fluids
comprising fresh water. Fresh water proved to be a major limitation because it was
carried out to sea via tankers with limited cargo capacity. Later offshore hydraulic
fracturing processes began utilizing a fracturing fluid comprising seawater. Seawater is
simply collected from the surrounding ocean, processed, and injected into the fracturing
site, thereby eliminating the production bottleneck of a limited fracturing fluid supply.
[0013]         Given the foregoing, systems and methods for transporting seawater from
a plentiful source (e.g., an ocean, saltwater lake, brine source, and the like) to a
hydraulic fracturing site are needed. Additionally, systems and methods for transporting,
processing and utilizing produced water generated during hydraulic fracturing processes
are needed. Systems and methods for transporting seawater and produced water to
areas with plentiful resources for de-salinization, additional hydraulic fracturing sites,
storage areas, and processing areas, are needed.
                                        SUMMARY
[0014]         This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts. These
concepts are further described below in the Detailed Description section. This Summary
is not intended to identify key features or essential features of this disclosure's subject
matter, nor is this Summary intended as an aid in determining the scope of the disclosed
subject matter.
[0015]         Aspects of the present disclosure may meet the above-identified needs by
providing systems and methods for transporting seawater from a source to an oilfield
drilling site and/or a hydraulic fracturing site. Specifically, in an aspect, systems and
methods are disclosed wherein seawater is pumped from an ocean at a coastal location
                                              3

and transported to an inland site via a pipeline, thereby providing a consistent, large
volume supply of seawater for use in operations such as drilling for oil and natural gas,
hydraulic fracturing operations, and the like.
[0016]          In an aspect, a large diameter pipeline originates at an extraction station,
such as a pumping station, located at a seawater source (e.g., the United States Gulf of
Mexico), enabling seawater to be pumped from the seawater source into the pipeline.
The pipeline extends inland to an area near a hydrocarbon-laden rock formation, such
as the Haynesville Shale Formation located under parts of southwestern Arkansas,
northwest Louisiana, and east Texas. Transported seawater is received at an inland site
(e.g., a drilling or hydraulic fracturing site) located near the rock formation and is then
used to augment or replace fresh water utilization at the inland site. That is, the drilling
"mud, " hydraulic fracturing fluids, and/or other fluids using in drilling or hydraulic
fracturing processes may comprise seawater sourced from a seawater source, such as
the United States Gulf of Mexico, and fresh water. In another aspect, such fluids
comprise seawater sourced from the sea and does not comprise fresh water.
[0017]          As of 2010, 60% of new oil and gas wells are created using water
intensive hydraulic fracturing processes. Each new oil and gas well created using
hydraulic fracturing may use three to 13 million gallons of fresh water, placing enormous
strain on local water tables, such as the Ogallala. Usage of seawater sourced from a
large supply such as the Gulf of Mexico or another seawater source (e.g., an ocean,
saltwater lake, brine source, and the like) eliminates usage of fresh water from local,
finite water tables, enabling drilling for oil and natural gas, hydraulic fracturing, and other
related processes to continue or expand without depleting local water tables or paying
for that rapidly decreasing resource.
[0018]          In an aspect, existing pipelines may be adapted for utilization with the
present disclosure. That is, seawater may be transported from the Gulf of Mexico, the
Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, or similar saltwater body, reservoir, or any other
location, to an inland site (e.g., oilfield drilling sites, hydraulic fracturing sites) using
existing pipelines. In some aspects, a portion of a seawater transportation system in
accordance with the present disclosure is constructed so that it interconnects a
seawater source with an existing pipeline. A delivery pipeline may be constructed so
that it originates at a portion of the existing pipeline proximal to the inland site and
terminates at the inland site.
                                                 4

[0019]           In an aspect, a seawater transportation system is configured to transport
seawater from a seawater source to a hydraulic fracturing site. Utilization of such
seawater generates produced water having higher concentrations of salt, other
compounds, and elements. Produced water must disposed of, reused, or cleaned. A
portion of the pipeline may be used to transport produced water to a second site. The
second site may be a disposal site, a desalinization site, another hydraulic fracturing
site, and the like.
[0020]           In an aspect, systems and methods are disclosed wherein seawater is
pumped from a plentiful source of seawater (e.g., an ocean) and transported to an
inland site via a seawater transportation system which comprises rail-based transports.
Seawater may be loaded onto tanker cars and carried by rail to a location at or near an
inland site, thereby providing a consistent, large volume supply of seawater for use in
oilfield drilling operations, hydraulic fracturing operations, and the like.
[0021]           A seawater transportation system comprising rail-based transports may
further comprise one or more pipelines to transport seawater.
[0022]           In an aspect, seawater transportation systems comprise alternative
transportation devices including, but not limited to: air transportation; commercial
vehicles; and ships. Such transportation devices may carry seawater the entire distance
between the plentiful source of seawater and the inland site, or a portion of the distance.
[0022A]          In an    aspect, there is provided      a fluid transportation system for
transporting seawater from a seawater source to an inland oilfield having an inland
oilfield wellbore, wherein transportation occurs at least partially by a transportation
mechanism, the system comprising:
         an extraction station, positioned at a seawater source, configured to collect
seawater from the seawater source;
         a loading station, configured to place the collected seawater in at least one of
railcar, a tanker truck, and a pipeline of the transportation mechanism for transportation;
         an unloading station, configured to unload the collected seawater from the
transportation mechanism; and
         an injector positioned at the inland oilfield wellbore, configured to receive the
collected seawater after the collected seawater has been transported via the
transportation mechanism, and further configured to inject the seawater into the inland
oilfield wellbore for subterranean operations;
                                                 5

         wherein the seawater source is one of: an ocean; a saltwater lake; and a sea;
and
         wherein the inland oilfield has at least one additional wellbore which has
previously utilized locally sourced water for subterranean operations.
[0022B]         In an aspect, there is provided a method of forming a drilling or hydraulic
fracturing fluid, the method comprising:
         (a)    collecting seawater from a seawater source;
         (b)    transporting the collected seawater from the seawater source to an inland
oilfield; and
         (c)    providing, at the inland oilfield, a quantity of the collected seawater from
the seawater source to an end user for injection into an inland oilfield wellbore for
subterranean operations;
         wherein the seawater source is one of: an ocean; a seawater gulf; a saltwater
lake; and a sea; and
         wherein the inland oilfield has at least one additional wellbore which has
previously solely utilized locally-sourced, freshwater-based fluid for hydraulic fracturing,
the locally-sourced, freshwater-based fluid not containing produced water;
         wherein transporting the collected seawater is performed with at least one of a
railcar, a tanker truck, and a pipeline.
[0023]          Further features and advantages of the present disclosure, as well as the
structure and operation of various aspects of the present disclosure, are described in
detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.

                                  DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0035]         The present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for utilizing
seawater to augment or replace utilization of fresh water in drilling and fracturing fluids;
the latter being used for hydraulic fracturing processes.
[0036]         Aspects of the present disclosure provide systems and methods for
transporting seawater from an oceanic source to an inland site (e.g., an oilfield drilling
site, a hydraulic fracturing site, an oil well, a natural gas well, a combination site, and the
like). Specifically, in an aspect, systems and methods are disclosed wherein seawater is
pumped from a body of water at a coastal location and transported to an inland drilling
and hydraulic fracturing site via a pipeline, thereby providing a consistent, large volume
supply of seawater for use in drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations.
                                                 7

[0037]          Unless otherwise noted, for the purposes of the present disclosure,
"seawater" refers to water originating from a source of water containing large amounts of
salt, such as the ocean, salt water lakes, a brine source, and the like.
[0038]          Referring now to FIGs. 1A & 1B, diagrams 100, 101 of an exemplary
inland site where hydraulic fracturing and natural gas drilling occur, which may be
augmented by systems and processes of the present disclosure, are shown.
[0039]          As shown in diagram 101, hydraulic fracturing processes may occur at an
inland site 110 comprising one or more wellbores 112. Hydraulic fracturing processes
create fractures in subterranean hydrocarbon-bearing formations 102 in order to release
hydrocarbons contained therein. In the United States, hydraulic fracturing is increasingly
implemented in order to create new oil and gas wells which tap into oil and gas
contained within shale rock formations. Shale formations may be 8,000 feet or more
below the surface.
[0040]          Hydraulic    fracturing   processes   release    hydrocarbons    trapped    in
subterranean hydrocarbon-bearing formations 102 via high pressure injection of a
fracturing fluid at wellbore 112. The fracturing fluid typically principally comprises fresh
water, sourced from a local aquifer 104. As shown in FIG. 1, hydraulic fracturing utilizes
water from local aquifer 104. Water may be stored in one or more storage tanks 106
(labeled, for clarity, only as storage tank 106 in FIG. 1B) until the water (or other base
fluid, such as seawater, disclosed in detail below) is needed.
[0041]          A base fluid, such as freshwater from aquifer 104 or seawater, may be
combined with one or more proppants and one or more additives to form the fracturing
fluid. In another aspect, the base fluid, or some combination of the base fluid and one or
more additional elements, such as a proppant (e.g., bentonite) or a chemical additive,
may be used as a drilling fluid.
[0042]          Proppants may be silica sand, resin-coated sand, ceramics, particulates,
and the like, and serve to keep an induced hydraulic fracture open during or following a
fracturing treatment. Proppants may be stored on site in proppant storage facility 116.
[0043]          The fracturing fluid may comprise slickwater additives, adapted to reduce
friction, allowing the fracturing fluid to be pumped into the fracture at a higher rate than if
water alone were used. Additives vary based on the characteristics of the base fluid and
the rock formation being fractured. Slickwater additives typically make up less than two
percent of the fracturing fluid and must be adjusted for each rock formation or play.
Borate salts and potassium chloride, a metal halide salt commonly used as a substitute
                                                8

for table salt, are also common fracturing fluid additives. Because salts may be used as
additives in fracturing fluids and offshore drilling and hydraulic fracturing utilizes
seawater as a base fluid, land-based hydraulic drilling and fracturing processes may be
adapted to utilize seawater-based fracturing fluids.
[0044]          Additives may also include one or more of: biocides, buffers, corrosion
inhibitors, crosslinkers, friction reducers, gelling agents, scale inhibitors, and surfactants.
Additives may be stored at inland site 110 in additive storage tank 114.
[0045]          Additives and proppants may be combined with a base fluid to form a
drilling or hydraulic fracturing fluid via one or more mixers 108 (labeled, for clarity, only
as mixer 108 in FIG. 1B). Mixer 108 may be fluidically connected to a storage tank 106,
additive storage tank 114, wellbore 112, a high-pressure pump, or the like.
[0046]          Inland site 110 may further comprise base fluid processing equipment (not
shown in FIGs. 1A & 1B) such as a water treatment facility configured to remove at least
one contaminant from the base fluid (e.g., via filters). In alternate aspects, a water
treatment facility is configured to remove one or more of the following: biological matter;
plastic debris; metals; pesticides; artificially created chemicals; and radioactive material.
[0047]          Inland site 110 may be adapted to measure physical properties (e.g.,
chemical content, pH, and the like) of the base fluid and add at least one additive based
on the measured physical properties of the base fluid. In an aspect, the base fluid is
seawater and the pH of the seawater may be measured and an acid or a base may be
added in order to maintain the pH of the seawater within a desired range.
[0048]          Inland site 110 may comprise one or more injectors (e.g., high-pressure
pumps) configured to inject a drilling fluid or a hydraulic fracturing fluid into wellbore 112
at the high pressures necessary to facilitate drilling or hydraulic fracturing. In an aspect,
wellbore 112 comprises an injector and the injector is fluidically connected to storage
tank 106 and mixer 108. An injector may be a high-pressure pump removably
positionable at wellbore 112.
[0049]          Fresh water may be extracted from local aquifer 104 via private wells or
public water wells. In many areas of significant drilling and hydraulic fracturing, ten
percent or more of the local aquifer 104 is devoted to supporting these activities. As
much as thirteen million gallons of locally-sourced fresh water may be injected into
wellbore 112 during hydraulic fracturing. 40 to 50% of this water eventually returns to
the surface as produced water. Produced water typically has a much higher
concentration of salt, other compounds, elements, and impurities. Such water must be
                                                 9

stored (e.g., in waste ponds, as shown in FIG. 1), removed, cleaned, pumped into
disposal wells, or reused. Typically, produced water is initially stored on site, creating a
risk to the local aquifer 104.
[0050]         Referring now to FIG. 2, a diagram 200 depicting the locations of known
subterranean hydrocarbon-bearing formations (e.g., shale formations) throughout the
lower 48 states, according to an aspect of the present disclosure, is shown.
[0051]         FIG. 2 shows multiple subterranean hydrocarbon-bearing formations 102,
namely shale formations 202 (shown, for clarity, as shale formations 202a-d in FIG. 2),
suitable for exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons via drilling and hydraulic
fracturing. Shale formations 202 are accessible from land-based drilling sites. Such sites
are often significantly inland, requiring the use of local aquifers for drilling and fracturing
fluids. Water sources 204 (shown, for clarity, only as water source 204a-c in FIG. 2)
such as the Gulf of Mexico 204b, the Atlantic Ocean 204c, and the Pacific Ocean 204a,
may provide seawater suitable for usage in land-based drilling and hydraulic fracturing
processes.
[0052]         Referring now to FIGs. 3 & 4, diagram 300 and diagram 400, respectively,
depict the location of multiple inland sites 110 and seawater transportation systems 310,
according to aspects of the present disclosure, are shown.
[0053]         Inland site 110 may be a land-based drilling and hydraulic fracturing site
302 (shown, for clarity, only as hydraulic fracturing sites 302a-d in FIG. 3). Inland sites
110 are typically located hundreds or thousands of miles inland, above shale formations
202.
[0054]         The terms "inland site," "drilling and hydraulic fracturing site," or "hydraulic
fracturing site" and/or the plural form of these terms are used interchangeably
throughout herein to refer to drilling sites, well sites, hydrocarbon extraction sites, and
the like wherein drilling fluids, fracturing fluids, pressurizing fluids, and the like are
utilized.
[0055]         Seawater transportation system 310 is configured to transport seawater
from a source 204 to one or more hydraulic fracturing sites 302. Transportation system
310 may comprise at least one pipeline 304 which interconnects an extraction station
306 located at or near source 204 to hydraulic fracturing site 302 located inland.
Hydraulic fracturing site 302 may be located tens or hundreds of miles away from water
source 204. Drilling and hydraulic fracturing sites, such as hydraulic fracturing site 302,
may comprise seawater storage tanks 106 (not shown in FIG. 3) that store seawater
                                                10

from transportation system 310. Seawater stored in such seawater storage tanks 106
may be used at a later time at hydraulic fracturing site 302, transported to another
hydraulic fracturing site 302 not located near pipeline 304 via another transportation
mechanism (e.g., rail, truck, air, and the like), or transported or used by other
facilities/industries (e.g., a desalinization plant, fisheries, and the like).
[0056]          As will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art(s) after reading
the description herein, transportation system 310 may comprise additional elements
found in aqueducts, oil pipelines, and other pipeline-based transportation systems. For
example, transportation system 310 may comprise an initial injection station, pump
stations, partial delivery stations, block valve stations, regulator stations, final delivery
stations and the like. Transportation system 310 may comprise branching pipeline 304,
as shown in FIG. 4, thereby enabling seawater to flow to multiple locations for utilization
at multiple hydraulic fracturing sites 302. Transportation system 310 may be used to
transport produced water from a first hydraulic fracturing site 302 to a second hydraulic
fracturing site 302. Additives may be introduced into the produced water in order to
enable the produced water to be used as fracturing fluid at the second hydraulic
fracturing site 302.
[0057]          In an aspect, extraction station 306 is located at source 204. In another
aspect, extraction station 306 is located a distance from source 204 and is configured to
receive seawater and pass such seawater into other portions of transportation systems
disclosed herein (e.g., systems comprising pipelines, systems comprising railcars, and
the like).
[0058]          In an aspect, a 48 inch diameter pipeline 304 originates at extraction
station 306 (e.g., a pumping station, pump, underwater pipe, or the like) located at Gulf
of Mexico 204, enabling seawater to be pumped from Gulf of Mexico 204 into pipeline
304. Pipeline 304 extends inland to an area near a hydrocarbon-laden rock formation
202, such as the Haynesville Shale Formation located under parts of southwestern
Arkansas, northwest Louisiana, and east Texas. Transported seawater is received at
hydraulic fracturing site 302 located near rock formation 202 and is then used to
augment or replace fresh water utilization drilling processes, hydraulic fracturing
processes, and the like. That is, the drilling or fracturing fluids used may comprise
seawater sourced from Gulf of Mexico 204 and fresh water. In another aspect, such
fluids may comprise seawater sourced from Gulf of Mexico 204 and do not comprise
any fresh water.
                                                11

[0059]          In an aspect, existing pipelines may be adapted for utilization with the
present disclosure. That is, seawater may be transported from water source 204 to
hydraulic fracturing sites 302 using existing pipelines. In some aspects, a portion of
seawater transportation system 310 in accordance with the present disclosure is
constructed which interconnects seawater source 204 with an existing pipeline. A
delivery pipeline may be constructed originating at a portion of the existing pipeline
proximal to hydraulic fracturing site 302 and terminating at hydraulic fracturing site 302.
[0060]          In an aspect, seawater transportation system 310 is configured to
transport seawater from seawater source 204 to a hydraulic fracturing site 302.
Utilization of such seawater generates produced water having higher concentrations of
salt, other compounds, and elements. Produced water must disposed of, reused, or
cleaned. Additional portions of seawater transportation system 310 may be used to
transport produced water to a second site. The second site may be a disposal site, a
storage site, a desalinization site, a fishery, a site operated by another industry, another
hydraulic fracturing site, and the like.
[0061]          Referring now to FIGs. 5A & 5B, diagrams 501 and 503 depicting,
respectively, the locations of known hydrocarbon-containing shale formations in the
State of Texas and the freight rail system in the State of Texas, according to an aspect
of the present disclosure, are shown.
[0062]          Diagram 501 is a detailed view of known hydrocarbon-containing shale
formations 202 (shown, for clarity, as shale formations 202a-b in FIG. 5A). For example,
the Barnett shale formation 202a is approximately five thousand square miles and
underlies Fort Worth, Texas as well as at least 17 counties in the State of Texas.
[0063]          Diagram 503 details freight railways 502 (shown, for clarity, as railways
502a-c in FIG. 5B) throughout the State of Texas. Typically, railways 502 are designed
to transport materials from shipping centers or manufacturing facilities to population
centers or finishing facilities. For example, railway 202 may start at a port 504 (shown,
for clarity, as ports 504a-b in FIG. 5B), such as the Port of Galveston 504a and extend
to a population center, such as Fort Worth, Texas. Railway 202 comprises various
stops, switches, and branches along the way, enabling cargo to be loaded and unloaded
along railway 202.
[0064]          Port 504 may comprise terminal switching railroads, such as the Galveston
Railroad, which facilitate transportation of cargo to and from ships at port 504. Port 504
                                               12

may comprise function-specific railways, which allow engines and railcars to transit
between railway 202 and a company-specific facility, such as extraction station 306.
[0065]         As shown in diagram 503, a plurality of railways 502 pass over shale
formations 202 shown in diagram 501. Many stops exist over shale formations 202.
Hydraulic fracturing sties 302 (not shown in FIGs. 5A & 5B) may be located near
existing railway stops. In an aspect, additional railway stops may be constructed near
hydraulic fracturing sites 302. In another aspect, transportation systems may be
constructed to move seawater from an existing railway stop to hydraulic fracturing site
302 (e.g., temporary, flexible pipelines, rigid pipelines, truck routes, and the like).
[0066]         Referring now to FIG. 6, a diagram 600 depicting the location of multiple
hydraulic fracturing sties 302 and seawater transportation system 310 comprising
railways 502, according to an aspect of the present disclosure, is shown.
[0067]         Seawater may be transported from source 204 to inland hydraulic
fracturing site 302 via seawater transportation system 310. Seawater may be used at
hydraulic fracturing site 302 to facilitate hydrocarbon extraction in lieu of locally-sourced
fresh water.
[0068]         In an aspect, seawater transportation system may comprise railway 502,
which originates at the Port of Galveston, passes through Bryan, Texas, Waco, Texas,
and terminates near Fort Worth, Texas, above the Barnett Shale Formation 202.
Railway 502 may receive seawater at Port of Galveston 504 and carry seawater by
tanker cars to hydraulic fracturing site 302 located at Barnett Shale Formation 202,
thereby supplying a consistent large volume of seawater for hydraulic fracturing
operations.
[0069]         In an aspect, seawater is pumped from source 204 via extraction station
306 and loaded onto railroad cars at a loading station (not shown). Upon loading, the
railcars are driven to an unloading station 602 comprising a railway stop. At unloading
station 602, the seawater is unloaded and utilized at hydraulic fracturing site 302.
[0070]         Railcars may be tanker cars or another vehicle configured to transport
seawater. Railway 502 may originate at port 504 or at a different location. Seawater may
be transported the majority of the distance between source 204 and hydraulic fracturing
site 302 via railway. In another aspect shown in FIG. 7, railway 502 transports seawater
only a portion of the distance between source 204 and hydraulic fracturing site 302.
Seawater transportation system 310 may additionally comprise at least one pipeline 304
configured to carry seawater. Seawater transportation system 310 may comprise
                                               13

additional elements enabling the seawater to be inserted and removed from pipeline 304
and loaded and unloaded from railroad cars. Seawater may be transferred multiple
times between pipelines 304 and railcars or other transportation mechanisms as it is
transported from source 204 to inland site 110.
[0071]          In an aspect, seawater transportation systems 310 comprise alternative
transportation devices including, but not limited to: air transportation; commercial
vehicles; and ships. Such transportation devices may carry seawater the entire distance
between source 204 and inland hydraulic fracturing site 302, or a portion of the distance.
[0072]          Now referring to FIG. 8, a flowchart illustrating an exemplary process 800
for utilizing seawater collected from seawater source 204 at inland site 110 for drilling or
hydraulic fracturing operations, according to an aspect of the present disclosure, is
shown.
[0073]          Process 800      may utilize some      or all of the following:     seawater
transportation system 310; roads; extraction station 306; pipeline 304. Such elements
may be located at one or more of the following: seawater source 204; port 504; railway
502; loading station; unloading station 602; inland site 110; hydraulic fracturing site 302;
shale formation 202; and the like. Process 800 begins at step 802 and passes
immediately to step 804.
[0074]          At step 804, seawater is collected from a seawater source. In an aspect,
collection is carried out by extraction station 306, namely a seawater pump, positioned
in or near seawater source 204 (e.g., the United States Gulf of Mexico). In another
aspect, seawater may be collected by marine vessels or other means that will be
apparent to those skilled in the relevant art(s) after reading the description herein.
[0075]          At step 806, the collected seawater is transported to inland site 110. In an
aspect, inland site 110 is located more than one hundred miles from seawater source
204. Inland site 110 may be located in an area of low annual rainfall, such as the Eagle
Ford Shale or the Permian Basin. The collected seawater may be transported using
seawater transportation system 310. In an aspect, collected seawater may be
transported at least a portion of the way by pipeline 304. Pipeline 304 may comprise
above ground piping, underground piping, temporary piping, and the like. In another
aspect, the collected seawater may be transported at least part of the way via railcar.
[0076]          At step 808, at least one sensor may be deployed to measure at least one
physical property of the collected seawater. In an aspect, the sensor may be deployed
at extraction station 306. In another aspect, one or more sensors may be deployed
                                              14

along transportation system 310. In another aspect, one or more sensors may be
deployed at inland site 110. The sensors may measure volume, temperature, chemical
content, pH level, salinity level, contaminant levels, and the like, thereby enabling the
collected seawater to be treated and/or utilized.
[0077]          At step 810, at least one additive is added to the collected seawater in
order to maintain the physical properties of the collected seawater within a desired
range. Additives may include a base, an acid, or another material that will be apparent
to those skilled in the relevant art(s) after reading the description herein. Step 810 may
be carried out at, for example, inland site 110.
[0078]          At step 812, at least one contaminant is removed from the collected
seawater. The at least one contaminant may be removed by base fluid processing
equipment. In an aspect, such equipment is located at inland site 110. In another
aspect, such equipment is located at extraction station 306, thereby removing
contaminants before the collected seawater is transported via, for example, pipeline 304
or via railcar.
[0079]          At step 814, at least one fracturing additive, such as a slickwater additive
is added to the collected seawater.
[0080]          At step 816, at least one proppant, such as silica sand, is added to the
collected seawater.
[0081]          Steps 814 and 816 convert the collected seawater into a seawater-based
hydraulic fracturing fluid. In another aspect, steps 814 and 814 may convert the
collected seawater into a drilling fluid.
[0082]          At step 818, seawater-based fluid, such as the seawater-based hydraulic
fracturing fluid, is injected into wellbore 112 in order to facilitate subterranean
operations, such as drilling or hydraulic fracturing. Process 800 then terminates at step
820.
[0083]          All or portions of process 800 may be carried out by, for example,
seawater collection companies, rail operators, pipeline operators, wellhead or drill site
operators, drilling fluids engineers, and the like.
[0084]          As will be apparent to those having skill in the relevant art(s) after reading
the description herein, process 800 may be modified by removing, rearranging, adding,
or substituting steps. For example, in another aspect, process 800 omits steps 808, 810
and 812. In another aspect process 800 omits steps 814 and 816.
                                               15

[0085]          As will be apparent to those having skill in the relevant art(s) after reading
the description herein, collected seawater, mixtures comprising collected seawater, and
the like may be stored during process 800 in, for example, storage tank 106.
[0086]           Now referring to FIG. 9, a flowchart illustrating an exemplary process 900
for utilizing seawater collected from seawater source 204 at inland site 110 for drilling or
hydraulic fracturing operations, according to an aspect of the present disclosure, is
shown.
[0087]          Some or all of the steps of process 900 are carried out at inland site 110.
In an aspect, inland site 110 operator carries out process 900. Process 900 begins at
step 902 and passes immediately to step 904.
[0088]          At step 904, seawater collected from seawater source 204 is received at
inland site 110. Seawater may be received at an unloading site via railcar. In another
aspect, seawater may be received via pipeline 304. In another aspect, seawater is
received via tanker trucks.
[0089]          At step 906, at least one additive, such as a pH balancing additive,
slickwater additive or proppant, is added to the collected seawater. Step 906 may be
carried out at inland site 110. In another aspect, step 906 may be carried out at
extraction station 306, or some other location. Seawater typically has a salinity of 30 to
50 ppt whereas freshwater has a salinity of 0 to .5 ppt. In an aspect, an additive is mixed
with the collected seawater in order to account for the salinity of the collected seawater,
or to facilitate usage of collected seawater when considering its salinity.
[0090]          At step 908, seawater-based fluid, such as the seawater-based hydraulic
fracturing fluid, is injected into wellbore 112 in order to facilitate subterranean
operations, such as drilling or hydraulic fracturing. Process 900 then terminates at step
910.
[0091]           Now referring to FIG. 10, a flowchart illustrating an exemplary process
1000 for transporting received seawater collected from seawater source 204, wherein
the destination of the received seawater is inland site 110, according to an aspect of the
present disclosure, is shown.
[0092]          Some or all of the steps of process 1000 may be carried out by a
transportation company, bulk carrier, or similar. Process 1000 begins at step 1002 and
passed immediately to step 1004.
[0093]          At step 1004, seawater which has been collected from seawater source
204 is received. In an aspect, the collected seawater is received at a loading station
                                               16

located at port 504 for loading onto a plurality of railcars. In another aspect, the collected
seawater is received at a loading station located inland from the port seawater source.
The collected seawater may be delivered by another transportation mechanism, such as
pipeline 304.
[0094]          At step 1006, the collected seawater is transported in order to facilitate
delivery of the collected seawater at inland site 110.
[0095]          At step 1008, the transported, collected seawater is provided. In an
aspect, this occurs at inland site 110 and the collected seawater is provided to an end
user such as a wellhead operator, a drill operator, an oil and gas company, or the like. In
another aspect, the collected seawater is only transported a portion of the way to inland
site 110, therefore the collected seawater may be transferred to another transportation
mechanism in order to facilitate delivery of the collected seawater at inland site 110 for
usage by an end user. Process 1000 then terminates at step 1010.
[0096]          This   disclosure should    not be     limited  to the    specifically named
transportation mechanisms discussed. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the
relevant arts after reading the description herein, alternative transportation mechanisms,
now known and developed in the future, may be used to transport seawater, or other
fluids or compositions of matter which may serve as a basis for fracturing fluid, from
plentiful seawater source 204 to inland hydraulic fracturing site 302. Such mechanisms
may be utilized to transport seawater a portion of the distance, or the entire distance.
[0097]          While various aspects of the present disclosure have been described
above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example and
not limitation. It will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s) that various

[0098]          In addition, it should be understood that the figures in the attachments,
which highlight the structure, methodology, functionality and advantages of the present
disclosure, are presented for example purposes only. The present disclosure is
sufficiently flexible and configurable, such that it may be implemented in ways other than
that shown in the accompanying figures (e.g., transportation of other fluids or
compositions of matter to inland hydraulic fracturing sites; utilization of transportation
mechanisms and devices other than those mentioned herein). As will be appreciated by
                                              17

those skilled in the relevant art(s) after reading the description herein, certain features

         wherein the injector is positioned at the inland site wellbore, located at least
around 40.23 kilometres from the ocean, connected to the pipeline at the second
pipeline connection point for receiving the seawater-based hydraulic fracturing fluid, and
configured to inject the seawater-based hydraulic fracturing fluid into the inland site
wellbore for subterranean operations.
11.      The method of claim 7, further comprising:
         receiving the seawater at the inland oilfield;
         adding at least one additive to the seawater, thereby forming a seawater-based
fluid; and
         injecting, at the inland oilfield wellbore, the seawater-based fluid for subterranean
operations.
12.      The method of claim 7, further comprising:
         measuring at least one physical property of the collected seawater wherein the
measuring occurs at least at one of the seawater source and the inland oilfield;
         and
         adding at least one treatment additive to the collected seawater based on the
measured at least one physical property.
13.      The method of any one of claims 7 to 9, 11 and 12, further comprising removing
at least one contaminant from the collected seawater, wherein the at least one
contaminant is at least one of: biological matter; plastic debris; metals; pesticides;
artificially created chemicals; and radioactive material.
14.      The fluid transportation system of claim 1, wherein the pipeline comprises a first
pipeline connection portion and a second pipeline connection portion, and wherein the
                                                 32
