The present invention relates to peptides, nucleic acids and cells for use in immunotherapeutic
methods. In particular, the present invention relates to the immunotherapy of cancer. The
present invention furthermore relates to tumor-associated cytotoxic T cell (CTL) peptide
epitopes, alone or in combination with other tumor-associated peptides that serve as active
pharmaceutical ingredients of vaccine compositions that stimulate anti-tumor immune
responses. The present invention relates to 67 novel peptide sequences and their variants
derived from HLA class I and HLA class II molecules of human tumor cells that can be used
in vaccine compositions for eliciting anti-tumor immune responses.
Background of the invention
Lung cancer accounts for the most cancer-related deaths in both men and women. Worldwide,
lung cancer is the most common cancer in terms of both incidence and mortality. In 2008,
there were 1.61 million new cases, and 1.38 million deaths due to lung cancer. The highest
rates are in Europe and North America.
Since 1987, more women have died each year from lung cancer than from breast cancer.
Death rates have continued to decline significantly in men from 1991-2003 by about 1.9% per
year. Female lung cancer death rates are approaching a plateau after continuously increasing
for several decades. These trends in lung cancer mortality reflect the decrease in smoking
rates over the past 30 years.
An estimated 230,000 new cases of lung cancer and 160,000 deaths due to lung cancer are
expected in 2013 in the USA according to the national cancer institute (NCI).
Lung cancer is classified clinically as small cell (13%, SCLC) or non-small cell (87%,
NSCLC) for the purposes of treatment. Prognosis is generally poor. Of all people with lung
cancer, 15% survive for five years after diagnosis. Stage is often advanced at the time of
diagnosis. At presentation, 3 0 - 4 0 % of cases of NSCLC are stage IV, and 60% of SCLC are
stage IV.
Treatment options are determined by the type (small cell or non-small cell) and stage of
cancer and include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted biological therapies
such as bevacizumab (AVASTIN@) and erlotinib (TARCEVA@). For localized cancers,
surgery is usually the treatment of choice. Recent studies indicate that survival with early
stage, non-small cell lung cancer is improved by chemotherapy following surgery. Because
the disease has usually spread by the time it is discovered, radiation therapy and
chemotherapy are often used, sometimes in combination with surgery. Chemotherapy alone or
combined with radiation is the usual treatment of choice for small cell lung cancer; on this
regimen, a large percentage of patients experience remission, which is long lasting in some
cases.
The 1-year relative survival for lung cancer has slightly increased from 37% in 1975-1979 to
42% in 2002, largely due to improvements in surgical techniques and combined therapies.
However, the 5-year survival rate for all stages combined is only 16%. The survival rate is
49% for cases detected when the disease is still localized; however, only 16% of lung cancers
are diagnosed at this early stage.

                                                 -2
Despite the above, there remains a need for new efficacious and safe treatment option for
cancers such as lung cancer, in particular non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric
cancers and brain tumors of different phenotypes which improve the well-being of the
patients by not using excessive chemotherapeutic agents or other agents that may lead to
severe side effects.
The present invention employs peptides that stimulate the immune system of the patient and
act as anti-tumor-agents in a non-invasive fashion.
Summary of the invention
In a first aspect of the present invention, the present invention provides a peptide consisting of
the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 2, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
Described herein is a peptide comprising a sequence that is selected from the group of SEQ
ID No. 1 to SEQ ID No. 65, and SEQ ID No. 76 to, and SEQ ID No. 84, and SEQ ID No. 92
or a variant thereof, which is at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, homologous (preferably at
least 80% or at least 90% identical) to SEQ ID No. I to SEQ ID No. 65, and SEQ ID No. 76
to SEQ ID No. 84, and SEQ ID No. 92, wherein said peptide or variant thereof has an overall
length for SEQ ID No. 1 to SEQ ID No. 65 and SEQ ID 78 to SEQ ID No. 84 and SEQ ID
No. 92 of between 8 and 100, preferably between 8 and 30, and most preferred of between 8
and 14 amino acids, and for SEQ ID No. 76 and 77 of between 12 and 100, preferably
between 12 and 30, and most preferred of between 12 to 18 amino acids.

Stimulation of an immune response is dependent upon the presence of antigens recognised as
foreign by the host immune system. The discovery of the existence of tumor associated anti
gens has raised the possibility of using a host's immune system to intervene in tumor growth.
Various mechanisms of harnessing both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system
are currently being explored for cancer immunotherapy.
Specific elements of the cellular immune response are capable of specifically recognising and
destroying tumor cells. The isolation of cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) from tumor-infiltrating cell
populations or from peripheral blood suggests that such cells play an important role in natural
immune defences against cancer. CD8-positive T-cells in particular, which recognise Class I
molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-bearing peptides of usually 8 to 10
amino acid residues derived from proteins or defect ribosomal products (DRIPS) located in
the cytosol, play an important role in this response. The MHC-molecules of the human are
also designated as human leukocyte-antigens (HLA).
There are two classes of MHC-molecules: MHC class I molecules that can be found on most
cells having a nucleus. MHC molecules are composed of an alpha heavy chain and beta-2
microglobulin (MHC class I receptors) or an alpha and a beta chain (MHC class II receptors),
respectively. Their three-dimensional conformation results in a binding groove, which is used

 WO 2015/018805                                                                PCT/EP2014/066755
for non-covalent interaction with peptides. MHC class I present peptides that result from pro
teolytic cleavage of predominantly endogenous proteins, DRIPs and larger peptides. MHC
class II molecules can be found predominantly on professional antigen presenting cells
(APCs), and primarily present peptides of exogenous or transmembrane proteins that are tak
en up by APCs during the course of endocytosis, and are subsequently processed. Complexes
of peptide and MHC class I molecules are recognized by CD8-positive cytotoxic T
lymphocytes bearing the appropriate TCR (T-cell receptor), whereas complexes of peptide
and MHC class II molecules are recognized by CD4-positive-helper-T cells bearing the ap
propriate TCR. It is well known that the TCR, the peptide and the MHC are thereby present in
a stoichiometric amount of 1:1:1.
CD4-positive helper T cells play an important role in inducing and sustaining effective re
sponses by CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells. The identification of CD4-positive T-cell epitopes
derived from tumor associated antigens (TAA) is of great importance for the development of
pharmaceutical products for triggering anti-tumor immune responses (Kobayashi et al., 2002;
Qin et al., 2003; Gnjatic et al., 2003). At the tumor site, T helper cells, support a CTL friendly
cytokine milieu (Mortara et al., 2006) and attract effector cells, e.g. CTLs, NK cells, macro
phages, granulocytes (Hwang et al., 2007).
In the absence of inflammation, expression of MHC class II molecules is mainly restricted to
cells of the immune system, especially professional antigen-presenting cells (APC), e.g.,
monocytes, monocyte-derived cells, macrophages, dendritic cells. In cancer patients, cells of
the tumor have surprisingly been found to express MHC class II molecules (Dengjel et al.,
2006).
It was shown in mammalian animal models, e.g., mice, that even in the absence of CTL effec
tor cells (i.e., CD8-positive T lymphocytes), CD4-positive T cells are sufficient for inhibiting
manifestation of tumors via inhibition of angiogenesis by secretion of interferon-gamma
(IFNy).
Additionally, it was shown that CD4-positive T cells recognizing peptides from tumor
associated antigens presented by HLA class II molecules can counteract tumor progression
via the induction of antibody (Ab) responses.
In contrast to tumor-associated peptides binding to HLA class I molecules, only a small num
ber of class II ligands of tumor associated antigens (TAA) have been described to date.
Since the constitutive expression of HLA class II molecules is usually limited to cells of the
immune system, the possibility of isolating class II peptides directly from primary tumors was
not considered possible. However, Dengjel et al. were successful in identifying a number of
MHC Class II epitopes directly from tumors (WO 2007/028574, EP 1 760 088 BI; (Dengjel
et al., 2006).
The antigens that are recognized by the tumor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, that is, their
epitopes, can be molecules derived from all protein classes, such as enzymes, receptors, tran
scription factors, etc. which are expressed and, as compared to unaltered cells of the same
origin, up-regulated in cells of the respective tumor.
Since both types of response, CD8 and CD4 dependent, contribute jointly and synergistically
to the anti-tumor effect, the identification and characterization of tumor-associated antigens
recognized by either CD8+ CTLs (ligand: MHC class I molecule + peptide epitope) or by

  WO 2015/018805                                                             PCT/EP2014/066755

CD4-positive T-helper cells (ligand: MHC class II molecule + peptide epitope) is important in
the development of tumor vaccines.
The present invention also relates to two new and very useful MHC class II peptides (accord
ing to SEQ ID NOs 76 and 77). These peptides are particularly useful in the diagnosis and/or
treatment of gastric cancer, NSCLC and other cancers over-expressing and / or over - present
ing MMP12 and POSTN respectively.
The present invention also relates to so-called length variants of the inventive MHC class II
peptides according to SEQ ID NO 76 or 77. As mentioned above, the peptide according to
SEQ ID NO 76 consists of the amino acid sequence INNYTPDMNREDVDYAIR (MMP12
peptide), and the peptide according to SEQ ID NO 77 consists of the amino acid sequence
TNGVIHVVDKLLYPADT (POSTN-002-peptide). The length variants are generally N
and/or C-terminally extended (between 1 and 5, preferably 1 to 10 amino acids) or N- and/or
C-terminally shortened (between 1 and 5 amino acids) peptides, which still can bind to MHC,
and elicit a cellular immune response as described herein. As is known in the state of the art,
peptides binding to class II proteins are not constrained in size and can vary from 11 to 30
amino acids in length. The peptide binding groove in the MHC class II molecules is open at
both ends, which enables binding of peptides with relatively longer length. Though the "core"
nine residues long segment contributes the most to the recognition of the peptide, the flanking
regions are also important for the specificity of the peptide to the class II allele (see, for ex
ample, Meydan C, et al., Prediction of peptides binding to MHC class I and II alleles by tem
poral motif mining. BMC Bioinformatics. 2013; 14 Suppl 2: S13. Epub 2013 Jan 21). Using
the many software tools as available (e.g. as described above), the person of skill in the art
will be able to identify the binding motif, and thus identify the possibilities for extensions
and/or deletions of the MHC class II peptides according to SEQ ID NO 76 or 77, in order to
create length variants.
For a peptide to trigger (elicit) a cellular immune response, it must bind to an MHC-molecule.
This process is dependent on the allele of the MHC-molecule and specific polymorphisms of
the amino acid sequence of the peptide. MHC-class-I-binding peptides are usually 8-12 amino
acid residues in length and usually contain two conserved residues ("anchors") in their se
quence that interact with the corresponding binding groove of the MHC-molecule. In this way
each MHC allele has a "binding motif' determining which peptides can bind specifically to
the binding groove.
In the MHC class I dependent immune reaction, peptides not only have to be able to bind to
certain MHC class I molecules being expressed by tumor cells, they also have to be recog
nized by T cells bearing specific T cell receptors (TCR).
The antigens that are recognized by the tumor specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, that is, their
epitopes, can be molecules derived from all protein classes, such as enzymes, receptors, tran
scription factors, etc. which are expressed and, as compared to unaltered cells of the same
origin, up-regulated in cells of the respective tumor.
The current classification of tumor associated antigens comprises the following major groups:
a) Cancer-testis antigens: The first TAAs ever identified that can be recognized by T cells
belong to this class, which was originally called cancer-testis (CT) antigens because of the
expression of its members in histologically different human tumors and, among normal tis
sues, only in spermatocytes/spermatogonia of testis and, occasionally, in placenta. Since the
cells of testis do not express class I and II HLA molecules, these antigens cannot be recog-

  WO 2015/018805                                                             PCT/EP2014/066755
                                               - 10
nized by T cells in normal tissues and can therefore be considered as immunologically tumor
specific. Well-known examples for CT antigens are the MAGE family members or NY-ESO
1.
b) Differentiation antigens: These TAAs are shared between tumors and the normal tissue
from which the tumor arose; most are found in melanomas and normal melanocytes. Many of
these melanocyte lineage-related proteins are involved in the biosynthesis of melanin and are
therefore not tumor specific but nevertheless are widely used for cancer immunotherapy. Ex
amples include, but are not limited to, tyrosinase and Melan-A/MART-1 for melanoma or
PSA for prostate cancer.
c) Overexpressed TAAs: Genes encoding widely expressed TAAs have been detected in his
tologically different types of tumors as well as in many normal tissues, generally with lower
expression levels. It is possible that many of the epitopes processed and potentially presented
by normal tissues are below the threshold level for T-cell recognition, while their overexpres
sion in tumor cells can trigger an anticancer response by breaking previously established tol
erance. Prominent examples for this class of TAAs are Her-2/neu, Survivin, Telomerase or
WT 1.
d) Tumor specific antigens: These unique TAAs arise from mutations of normal genes (such
as -catenin, CDK4, etc.). Some of these molecular changes are associated with neoplastic
transformation and/or progression. Tumor specific antigens are generally able to induce
strong immune responses without bearing the risk for autoimmune reactions against normal
tissues. On the other hand, these TAAs are in most cases only relevant to the exact tumor on
which they were identified and are usually not shared between many individual tumors.
e) TAAs arising from abnormal post-translational modifications: Such TAAs may arise from
proteins which are neither specific nor overexpressed in tumors but nevertheless become tu
mor associated by posttranslational processes primarily active in tumors. Examples for this
class arise from altered glycosylation patterns leading to novel epitopes in tumors as for
MUC 1 or events like protein splicing during degradation which may or may not be tumor
specific.
f) Oncoviral proteins: These TAAs are viral proteins that may play a critical role in the onco
genic process and, because they are foreign (not of human origin), they can evoke a T-cell
response. Examples of such proteins are the human papilloma type 16 virus proteins, E6 and
E7, which are expressed in cervical carcinoma.
For proteins to be recognized by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes as tumor-specific or -associated
antigens, and to be used in a therapy, particular prerequisites must be fulfilled. The antigen
should be expressed mainly by tumor cells and not or in comparably small amounts by normal
healthy tissues or in another preferred embodiment the peptide should be over-presented by
tumor cells as compared to normal healthy tissues. It is furthermore desirable, that the respec
tive antigen is not only present in a type of tumor, but also in high concentrations (i.e. copy
numbers of the respective peptide per cell). Tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens are
often derived from proteins directly involved in transformation of a normal cell to a tumor
cell due to a function e.g. in cell cycle control or suppression of apoptosis. Additionally,
downstream targets of the proteins directly causative for a transformation may be upregulated
und thus may be indirectly tumor-associated. Such indirect tumor-associated antigens may
also be targets of a vaccination approach (Singh-Jasuja et al., 2004). In both cases it is essen
tial that epitopes are present in the amino acid sequence of the antigen, since such a peptide
("immunogenic peptide") that is derived from a tumor associated antigen should lead to an in
vitro or in vivo T-cell-response.
Basically, any peptide able to bind a MHC molecule may function as a T-cell epitope. A pre
requisite for the induction of an in vitro or in vivo T-cell-response is the presence of a T cell

  WO 2015/018805                                                            PCT/EP2014/066755
                                               - 11
with a corresponding TCR and the absence of immunological tolerance for this particular
epitope.
Therefore, TAAs are a starting point for the development of a tumor vaccine. The methods for
identifying and characterizing the TAAs are based on the use of CTL that can be isolated
from patients or healthy subjects, or they are based on the generation of differential transcrip
tion profiles or differential peptide expression patterns between tumors and normal tissues.
However, the identification of genes over-expressed in tumor tissues or human tumor cell
lines, or selectively expressed in such tissues or cell lines, does not provide precise infor
mation as to the use of the antigens being transcribed from these genes in an immune therapy.
This is because only an individual subpopulation of epitopes of these antigens are suitable for
such an application since a T cell with a corresponding TCR has to be present and immuno
logical tolerance for this particular epitope needs to be absent or minimal. In a very preferred
embodiment of the invention it is therefore important to select only those over- or selectively
presented peptides against which a functional and/or a proliferating T cell can be found. Such
a functional T cell is defined as a T cell, which upon stimulation with a specific antigen can
be clonally expanded and is able to execute effector functions ("effector T cell").
In case of TCRs and antibodies according to the invention the immunogenicity of the underly
ing peptides is secondary. For TCRs and antibodies according to the invention the presenta
tion is the determining factor.
T-helper cells play an important role in orchestrating the effector function of CTLs in anti
tumor immunity. T-helper cell epitopes that trigger a T-helper cell response of the TH1 type
support effector functions of CD8-positive killer T cells, which include cytotoxic functions
directed against tumor cells displaying tumor-associated peptide/MHC complexes on their
cell surfaces. In this way tumor-associated T-helper cell peptide epitopes, alone or in combi
nation with other tumor-associated peptides, can serve as active pharmaceutical ingredients of
vaccine compositions that stimulate anti-tumor immune responses.
Uses against further cancers are disclosed in the following description of the proteins of the
peptides according to the invention.
ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A (ABC 1), member 13 (ABCA13)
In human, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transmembrane transporters has at least
48 genes and 7 gene subfamilies. The predicted ABCA13 protein consists of 5,058 amino acid
residues making it the largest ABC protein described to date (Prades et al., 2002). Knight et
al. determined that ABCA13 protein is expressed in mouse and human hippocampus and cor
tex, both regions relevant to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Knight et al., 2009). The
ABCA13 gene maps to chromosome 7pl2.3, a region that contains an inherited disorder af
fecting the pancreas (Shwachman-Diamond syndrome) as well as a locus involved in T-cell
tumor invasion and metastasis (INM7), and therefore is a positional candidate for these pa
thologies (Prades et al., 2002).
Matrix metallopeptidase 12 (macrophage elastase) (MMP12)
MMP12, also known as human metalloelastase (HME) or macrophage metalloelastase
(MME) is a zinc endopeptidase recognized for its ability to degrade elastin. Apart from that, it
has a broad substrate range, extending to other matrix proteins such as collagens, fibronectin,
laminin, proteoglycans, and non-matrix proteins such as alpha-i -antitrypsin. In asthma, em
physema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), MMP12 may contribute to al-

  WO 2015/018805                                                             PCT/EP2014/066755
                                               - 12
veolar destruction and airway remodeling (Cataldo et al., 2003; Wallace et al., 2008). MMP12
has been implicated in macrophage migration, and as it can generate angiostatin from plas
minogen, it contributes to inhibition of angiogenesis (Chakraborti et al., 2003; Chandler et
al., 1996; Sang, 1998). Like other metalloproteinases, MMP12 is involved in physiological
processes like embryogenesis, wound healing and the menstrual cycle (Chakraborti et al.,
2003; Labied et al., 2009), but also in pathological processes of tissue destruction.
Although data are based on low numbers of patients in several cases, there is ample evidence
in literature that MMP12 is frequently over-expressed in cancer (Denys et al., 2004;
Hagemann et al., 2001; Ma et al., 2009; Vazquez-Ortiz et al., 2005; Ye et al., 2008). Howev
er, data are controversial with respect to the impact of MMP12 over-expression on clinical
parameters and prognosis. While it may be involved in matrix dissolution and, thus, metasta
sis, it can also inhibit tumor growth through production of angiostatin, which negatively im
pacts angiogenesis (Gorrin-Rivas et al., 2000; Gorrin Rivas et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2004).
For lung cancer, consequences of MMP12 expression are controversial. MMP12 overexpres
sion in epithelial cells has been reported in inflammation-triggered lung remodeling. MMP12
up-regulation may play a role in emphysema-to-lung cancer transition (Qu et al., 2009). An
imal studies suggest that MMP12 expression by stroma or macrophages suppresses growth of
lung tumors (Acuff et al., 2006; Houghton et al., 2006). However, there are also reports that
MMP12 over-expression in lung tumors correlates with recurrence, metastatic disease and
shorter relapse-free survival after resection (Cho et al., 2004; Hofmann et al., 2005).
Dystonin (DST)
DST (BPAG1-e) encodes a member of the plakin protein family of adhesion junction plaque
proteins. BPAG1-e is expressed in epithelial tissue, anchoring keratin-containing intermediate
filaments to hemidesmosomes (HDs). HDs are multiprotein adhesion complexes that promote
epithelial stromal attachment in stratified and complex epithelia. Modulation of their function
is of crucial importance in a variety of biological processes, such as differentiation and migra
tion of keratinocytes during wound healing and carcinoma invasion, in which cells become
detached from the substrate and acquire a motile phenotype (Litjens et al., 2006).
Malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of tumor. BPAG1 is expressed in
human melanoma cell lines (A375 and G361) and normal human melanocytes. The levels of
anti-BPAG1 auto-antibodies in the sera of melanoma patients were significantly higher than
in the sera of healthy volunteers (p<0.01). Anti-BPAG1 auto-antibodies may be a promising
marker for the diagnosis of melanoma (Shimbo et al., 2010). DST was associated with breast
cancer invasion (Schuetz et al., 2006). The BPAG1 gene is likely to be involved in the prolif
eration, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC (Fang et al.,
2005).
Matrix-remodeling associated 5 (MXRA5)
MXRA5, also known as adlican, encodes an adhesion proteoglycan and belongs to a group of
genes involved in ECM remodeling and cell-cell adhesion (Rodningen et al., 2008). Although
the function of MXRA5 in cancer is unknown, somatic mutations in MXRA5 have been iden
tified in tumors obtained from a variety of tissues such as skin, brain, lung, and ovary. RT
PCR was performed on adlican (MXRA5) confirmed microarray findings of overexpression
in colon cancers compared to normal colon tissue (13 colorectal tumors and 13 normal tis
sues) (Zou et al., 2002). In a recent study, matrix-remodeling associated 5 was the second
most frequently mutated gene in NSCLC (first is TP53) (Xiong et al., 2012).

Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) / cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6)
CDK4 is a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. It is a catalytic subunit of the protein
kinase complex that is important for cell cycle GI phase progression. The activity of this ki
nase is restricted to the Gi-to S phase transition during the cell cycle and its expression is
primarily controlled at the transcriptional level (Xiao et al., 2007). CDK4 and CDK6 enzymes
and their regulators, e.g., cyclins, play critical roles in embryogenesis, homeostasis, and can
cerogenesis (Graf et al., 2010).
In lung cancer tissues the expression level of CDK4 protein was significantly increased com
pared to normal tissues (P < 0.001). Patients with higher CDK4 expression had a markedly
shorter overall survival time than patients with low CDK4 expression. Multivariate analysis
suggested the level of CDK4 expression was an independent prognostic indicator (P < 0.00 1)
for the survival of patients with lung cancer. Furthermore, suppressing CDK4 expression also
significantly elevated the expression of cell cycle regulator p21 (Wu et al., 2011 a). In lung
cells that express an endogenous K-Ras oncogene, ablation of Cdk4, but not Cdk2 or Cdk6,
induces an immediate senescence response. No such response occurs in lungs expressing a
single Cdk4 allele or in other K-Ras-expressing tissues. Targeting Cdk4 alleles in advanced
tumors detectable by computed tomography scanning also induces senescence and prevents
tumor progression (Puyol et al., 2010).
Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Hi (H) (HNRNPH1) / heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein H2 (H') (HNRNPH2)
These genes belong to the subfamily of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonu
cleoproteins (hnRNPs). The hnRNPs are RNA binding proteins and they complex with heter
ogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). These proteins are associated with pre-mRNAs in the nu
cleus and appear to influence pre-mRNA processing and other aspects of mRNA metabolism
and transport.
hnRNPH activity appears to be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of malignant
gliomas as the center of a splicing oncogenic switch, which might reflect reactivation of stem
cell patterns and mediates multiple key aspects of aggressive tumor behavior, including eva
sion from apoptosis and invasiveness (Lefave et al., 2011). Small interfering RNA-mediated
knockdown of hnRNP H or A-Raf resulted in MST2-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, en
forced expression of either hnRNP H or A-Raf partially counteracted apoptosis induced by
etoposide (Rauch et al., 2010). Up-regulation of hnRNP H/H' is found in a few tissues that
normally express low cytoplasmic levels of hnRNP H/H', for example, adenocarcinoma of the
pancreas, hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric carcinoma (Honore et al., 2004).
Tetratricopeptide repeat, ankyrin repeat and coiled-coil containing 2 (TANC2)
TANC family comprises TANCI and TANC2, which was identified in 2005 (Han et al.,
2010). TANC family proteins are involved in the regulation of dendritic spines, spatial learn
ing, and embryonic development, as TANC 1-deficiency in mice reduces spine density in the
hippocampus and impaired spatial learning, whereas TANC2-deficiency causes embryonic
lethality. In contrast, overexpression of TANC 1 and TANC2 in cultured neurons enhances the
density of dendritic spines and excitatory synapses. TANCI and 2 proteins are mainly ex
pressed in the brain, in which a significant proportion of protein is located in small-vesicle
membranes (Han et al., 2010).
Ring finger protein 213 (RNF213)

  WO 2015/018805                                                             PCT/EP2014/066755
                                               - 14
RNF213 encodes a protein containing a C3HC4-type RING finger domain, which is a special
ized type of Zn-finger that binds two atoms of zinc and is thought to be involved in mediating
protein-protein interactions.
A research group provided evidence suggesting, for the first time, the involvement of
RNF213 in genetic susceptibility to moyamoya disease (Liu et al., 2011 b). Another study has
shown that the RNF213 gene was related to moymoya disease susceptibility in the Han Chi
nese population (Wu et al., 2012).
Solute carrier family 34 (sodium phosphate), member 2 (SLC34A2)
SLC34A2 is a pH-sensitive sodium-dependent phosphate transporter. Upregulation of
SLC34A2 gene expression in well-differentiated tumors may reflect cell differentiation pro
cesses during ovarian cancerogenesis and could serve as potential marker for ovarian cancer
diagnosis and prognosis (Shyian et al., 2011). RT-PCR confirmed increased expression of
SLC34A2 in papillary thyroid cancer (Kim et al., 2010b). There was also a significantly in
creased gene expression of SLC34A2 among breast cancer tissues compared with normal tis
sues (Chen et al., 2010a).
SET and MYND domain containing 3 (SMYD3)
It was previously reported that upregulation of SMYD3, a histone H3 lysine-4-specific me
thyltransferase, plays a key role in the proliferation of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and hepa
tocellular carcinoma (HCC). In another study, they reveal that SMYD3 expression is also ele
vated in the great majority of breast cancer tissues. Similarly to CRC and HCC, silencing of
SMYD3 by small interfering RNA to this gene resulted in the inhibited growth of breast can
cer cells, suggesting that increased SMYD3 expression is also essential for the proliferation of
breast cancer cells (Hamamoto et al., 2006). Knockdown of SMYD3 by RNA interference
down-regulates c-Met expression and inhibits cells migration and invasion induced by HGF
(Zou et al., 2009). SMYD3 plays crucial roles in HeLa cell proliferation and migra
tion/invasion, and it may be a useful therapeutic target in human cervical carcinomas (Wang
et al., 2008b).
Aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C1 (AKR1C1) / aldo-keto reductase family 1,
member C2 (AKR1C2)
AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 differ in only seven amino-acid residues (Le et al., 2010). AKR1C1
and AKRIC2 regulate the activity of androgens, estrogens, and progesterone, and the occu
pancy and transactivation of the corresponding receptors (Penning et al., 2000; Steckelbroeck
et al., 2004). The AKR1C enzymes, except AKR1C4 which is liver specific, are expressed in
different normal and diseased tissues and have thus been related to several diseases, such as
lung, breast, prostate, endometrial cancer, myeloid leukemia, and others (Brozic et al., 2011;
Byrns et al., 2011). Sensitivity to cisplatin appeared to be associated with AKR1C levels in
epithelial lung cancer cell lines (Chen et al., 2010b) and in NSCLC patients (Kuang et al.,
2012; Stewart, 2010). Thus, overexpression of AKR1C is an indicator of poor prognosis and
chemo-resistance in human non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) (Wang et al., 2007). Overexpres
sion of AKR1C2 is also associated with disease progression in prostatic cancer (Huang et al.,
2010). Depletion of AKR1C2 expression with RNAi inhibits turmorigenesis in vivo and in
vitro, which strongly suggests that AKR1C2 siRNA might play a critical role in blocking
hepatocarcinogenesis (Dong-Dong, 2007).
Reticulocalbin 1, EF-hand calcium binding domain (RCN1) / reticulocalbin 3, EF-hand
calcium binding domain (RCN3)

  WO 2015/018805                                                            PCT/EP2014/066755
                                               - 15
Reticulocalbin 1 is a calcium-binding protein located in the lumen of the ER. Immunohisto
chemical examination demonstrated a broad distribution of RCN in various organs of fetuses
and adults, predominantly in the endocrine and exocrine organs. Overexpression of RCN may
play a role in tumorigenesis, tumor invasion, and drug resistance (Fukuda et al., 2007). Re
ticulocalbin 1 (RCN1) is a cell surface-associated protein on both endothelial (EC) and pros
tate cancer (PCa) cell lines. RCN1 expression on the cell surface was upregulated by tumor
necrosis factor alpha treatment of bone-marrow endothelial cells (Cooper et al., 2008). RCN1
is up-regulated in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and was localized in cancer cells or in stromal
cells near the cancer cells. It could be a novel candidate for CRC marker (Watanabe et al.,
2008). RCN3 is a member of the CREC (Cab45/reticulocalbin/ERC45/calumenin) family of
multiple EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins localized to the secretory pathway (Tsuji et al.,
2006). In oligodendrogliomas RCN3 is suggested as a potentially important candidate gene.
Though little is known about the function of RCN3 (Drucker et al., 2009).
Interleukin 8 (IL8)
IL8 is a chemokine of the CXC family that is one of the major mediators of the inflammatory
response. This chemokine is secreted by several cell types. It functions as a chemoattractant,
and is also a potent angiogenic factor. The CXC (ELR+) chemokines like IL8 induce angio
genesis and may be important in cancers that have an angiogenic phenotype such as NSCLC
(Arenberg et al., 1997). Recently it was found that tumor derived IL8 acted as an attractant for
circulating tumor cells to return to the original tumor (breast cancer, colon cancer, and mela
noma tumors), leading to a more aggressive tumor phenotype (Kim et al., 2009). IL-8 levels
are associated with lung cancer risk several years before diagnosis. Combination of IL-8 and
CRP are more robust biomarkers in predicting subsequent lung cancer (Pine et al., 2011). Ac
tivating mutations of KRAS or EGFR upregulate IL-8 expression in NSCLC; IL-8 is highly
expressed in NSCLCs from males, smokers, elderly patients, NSCLCs with pleural involve
ment, and KRAS-mutated adenocarcinomas; and IL-8 plays a role in cell growth and migra
tion in oncogenic KRAS-driven NSCLC (Sunaga et al., 2012).
Pyrimidinergic receptor P2Y, G-protein coupled, 6 (P2RY6)
P2RY6 belongs to the family of G-protein coupled receptors. This family has several receptor
subtypes with different pharmacological selectivity, which overlaps in some cases, for various
adenosine and uridine nucleotides. The P2Y6 subtype is expressed at particularly high levels
in the placenta, suggesting that P2Y6 plays an important role in placental function. However,
the cellular localization of P2Y6 within the placenta is unknown. P2Y6 may play an im
portant role in trophoblastic development, differentiation, and neoplasia (Somers et al., 1999).
An important role for the pyrimidine-activated P2Y receptor in the inflammatory response of
lung epithelia was indicated (Schafer et al., 2003).
HECT, UBA and WWE domain containing 1, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (HUWE1)
HUWE1 encodes a member of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase family. The HECT domain lies
in the C-terminus and contains the active-site cysteine which forms an intermediate ubiquitin
thioester bond.
ARF-BP1 (HUWE1) is a critical mediator of both the p53-independent and p53-dependent
tumor suppressor functions of ARF. As such, ARF-BP1 may serve as a potential target for
therapeutic intervention in tumors regardless of p53 status (Chen et al., 2005a). Inactivation of
ARF-BPl stabilized p53 and induced apoptosis (Chen et al., 2006). HUWEl (HectH9) is
overexpressed in multiple human tumors and is essential for proliferation of a subset of tumor
cells (Adhikary et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2011 a). In breast cancer HUWE1 correlated signifi
cantly with relevant prognostic factors, and with clinical outcome (Confalonieri et al., 2009).

                                              - 16
Versican (VCAN)
VCAN is a member of the aggrecan/versican proteoglycan family. VCAN is known to associ
ate with a number of molecules in the extracellular matrix including hyaluronan, tenascin,
fibulin-1, fibronectin, CD44 and L-selectin, fibrillin, integrin, and link protein (Zheng et al.,
2004). VCAN is expressed in a variety of tissues. It is highly expressed in the early stages of
tissue development, and its expression decreases after tissue maturation. Its expression is also
elevated during wound repair and tumor growth (Ghosh et al., 2010). Knockdown in human
lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells of VCAN by RNA interference significantly inhibited tu
mor growth in vivo but not in vitro (Creighton et al., 2005). VCAN is a direct target of p53.
High expression of VCAN has also been found in the peritumoral stromal tissue of early stage
prostate cancers, and of breast cancers, and it is associated with an aggressive tumor behavior
(Yoon et al., 2002).
Drosha, ribonuclease type III (DROSHA)
Drosha is a Class 2 RNase III enzyme responsible for initiating the processing of microRNA
(miRNA), or short RNA molecules naturally expressed by the cell that regulate a wide variety
of other genes by interacting with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to induce
cleavage of complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) as part of the RNAi pathway. A mi
croRNA molecule is synthesized as a long RNA primary transcript known as a pri-miRNA,
which is cleaved by Drosha to produce a characteristic stem-loop structure of about 70 base
pairs long, known as a pre-miRNA (Lee et al., 2003). Drosha exists as part of a protein com
plex called the Microprocessor complex, which also contains the double-stranded RNA bind
ing protein Pasha (also called DGCR8) (Denli et al., 2004), which is essential for Drosha ac
tivity and is capable of binding single-stranded fragments of the pri-miRNA that are required
for proper processing (Han et al., 2006). Human Drosha was cloned in 2000, when it was
identified as a nuclear dsRNA ribonuclease involved in the processing of ribosomal RNA
precursors (Wu et al., 2000). Drosha was the first human RNase III enzyme identified and
cloned. The other two human enzymes that participate in the processing and activity of miR
NA are the Dicer and Argonaute proteins. Both Drosha and Pasha are localized to the cell
nucleus, where processing of pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA occurs. This latter molecule is then
further processed by the RNase Dicer into mature miRNAs in the cell cytoplasm (Lee et al.,
2003). Drosha and other miRNA processing enzymes may be important in cancer prognosis
(Slack and Weidhaas, 2008).
Pleckstrin homology domain containing, family A (phosphoinositide binding specific)
member 8 (PLEKHA8)
The gene for phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate adaptor-2 (FAPP2 = PLEKHA8) encodes a
cytoplasmic lipid transferase with a plekstrin homology domain that has been implicated in
vesicle maturation and transport from trans-Golgi to the plasma membrane (Cao et al., 2009).
The introduction of ribozymes targeting the FAPP2 gene in colon carcinoma cells induced
their apoptosis in the presence of Fas agonistic antibody. Also, FAPP2 siRNA transfected
glioma and breast tumor cells showed significant increases in apoptosis (Tritz et al., 2009).
Later studies have highlighted a role for FAPP2 as lipid transfer protein involved in glyco
sphingolipid metabolism at the Golgi complex (D'Angelo et al., 2012). Phosphoinositol 4
phosphate adaptor protein-2 (FAPP2) plays a key role in glycosphingolipid (GSL) production
using its C-terminal domain to transport newly synthesized glucosylceramide away from the
cytosol-facing glucosylceramide synthase in the cis-Golgi for further anabolic processing
(Kamlekar et al., 2013).
Acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA)

  WO 2015/018805                                                                PCT/EP2014/066755
                                                - 17
ACACA is a biotin-containing enzyme which catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to
malonyl-CoA, the rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis (Tong and Harwood, Jr., 2006).
ACACA up-regulation has been recognized in multiple human cancers, promoting lipogenesis
to meet the need of cancer cells for rapid growth and proliferation. Therefore, ACACA might
be effective as a potent target for cancer intervention, and the inhibitors developed for the
treatment of metabolic diseases would be potential therapeutic agents for cancer therapy
(Wang et al., 2010a). Two studies have shown that silencing of ACACA by RNA interference
causes growth inhibition and induces cell death almost to the same extent as observed after
silencing of FASN gene expression (Brusselmans et al., 2005; Chajes et al., 2006). TOFA (5
tetradecyloxy-2-furoic acid), an allosteric inhibitor of ACACA, is cytotoxic to lung cancer
cells NCI-H460 and colon carcinoma cells HCT-8 and HCT-15 and induce apoptosis (Wang
et al., 2009a). Another highly potent inhibitor of ACACA, soraphen A, blocks lipogenesis and
enhances fatty acid oxidation in prostate cancer cells. Cancer cells stop proliferating and ulti
mately die (Beckers et al., 2007). These findings suggest that apart from malonyl-CoA accu
mulation, inhibition of lipogenesis per se may cause cancer cell death and that ACACA may
be a target for antineoplastic therapy after all (Brusselmans et al., 2005).
Integrin, alpha 11 (ITGA11)
Integrins play crucial roles in diverse cellular and developmental processes, including cell
growth, differentiation, and survival, as well as carcinogenesis, cancer cell invasion, and me
tastases. Integrin alphal 1 (ITGAl l/alphal 1) is localized to stromal fibroblasts and commonly
overexpressed in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The alpha 11 mRNA was overex
pressed in both lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (Wang et al., 2002). It has
been reported that alpha 11 plays an important role in the ability of fibroblasts to promote the
growth of NSCLC cells in vivo, and such activity is partially mediated by its regulation of
IGF2 expression (Zhu et al., 2007). For NSCLC patients' clinicopathological characteristics,
the overexpression of hMTH1, SPD, HABP 2, ITGAl1, COL11Al, and CK-19 was signifi
cantly correlated with the pathological stage (p<0.05). In addition, the overexpression of
hMTH1, SPD, ITGA1 1, and COL1 1A1 was correlated with lymph node metastasis and poor
prognosis (Chong et al., 2006).
Collagen, type XII, alpha 1 (COL12A1)
The COL12A1 gene encodes the alpha chain of type XII collagen, a member of the FACIT
(fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices) collagen family. Type XII collagen
is a homotrimer found in association with type I collagen, an association that is thought to
modify the interactions between collagen I fibrils and the surrounding matrix (Oh et al.,
1992). COL12A1 may be involved in basement membrane regulation providing specific mo
lecular bridges between fibrils and other matrix components (Thierry et al., 2004). COL12A1
is expressed in heart, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle and pancreas (Dharmavaram et al.,
1998), in a variety of connective tissues including articular and epiphyseal cartilage (Gregory
et al., 2001; Walchli et al., 1994; Watt et al., 1992). COL12A1 was down-regulated in tumors
with high microsatellite instability when compared to the stable group with low or null mi
crosatellite instability (Ortega et al., 2010).
Elastase, neutrophil expressed (ELANE)
Neutrophil elastase (or leukocyte elastase) also known as ELA2 (elastase 2, neutrophil) is a
seine proteinase in the same family as chymotrypsin and has broad substrate specificity. Se
creted by neutrophils during inflammation, it destroys bacteria and host tissue (Belaaouaj et
al., 2000). Human neutrophil elastase (ELANE), a main actor in the development of chronic
obstructive pulmonary diseases, has been recently involved in non-small cell lung cancer pro
gression. It can act at several levels (i) intracellularly, clearing for instance the adaptor mole-

  WO 2015/018805                                                            PCT/EP2014/066755

cule insulin receptor substrate-i (IRS-1) (ii) at the cell surface, hydrolyzing receptors as
CD40 (iii) in the extracellular space, generating elastin fragments i.e. morphoelastokines
which potently stimulate cancer cell invasiveness and angiogenesis (Moroy et al., 2012). Neu
trophil elastase directly induced tumor cell proliferation in both human and mouse lung ade
nocarcinomas by gaining access to an endosomal compartment within tumor cells, where it
degraded insulin receptor substrate-I (IRS-1) (Houghton et al., 2010).
Serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade B (ovalbumin), member 3 (SERPINB3)
Squamous cellular carcinoma antigen (SCCA), also called SERPINB3, is a member of the
high molecular weight family of serine protease inhibitors (serpins) (Suminami et al., 1991).
High levels have been reported in cancer of the head and neck tissue and other epithelial can
cers (Torre, 1998). SCCA has been reported to be overexpressed in tumoral compared to peri
tumoral tissue, suggesting a role as a potential marker for histological detection of HCC
(Pontisso et al., 2004). Serpin B3/B4, particularly Serpin B4, appears to play an important
role in aberrant epithelial proliferation. Evaluation of Serpin B3/B4 could have prognostic
value in predicting disease progression, especially in patients with increased susceptibility to
lung cancer (Calabrese et al., 2012). On one hand, SCCA1 (SERPINB3) inhibits cell death
induced by lysosomal injury while, on the other hand, it sensitizes cells to ER stress by acti
vating caspase-8 independently of the death receptor apoptotic pathway (Ullman et al., 2011).
Some findings indicate that SERPINB3 plays an important role in the induction of epidermal
barrier disruption. SERPINB3 may be a critical determinant of barrier function in the epider
mis (Katagiri et al., 2010).
Kinesin family member 26B (KIF26B)
A kinesin is a protein belonging to a class of motor proteins found in eukaryotic cells. Kine
sins move along microtubule filaments, and are powered by the hydrolysis of ATP (thus kine
sins are ATPases). Kif26b, a kinesin family gene, is a downstream target of Sall1
(Nishinakamura et al., 2011). Kif26b is essential for kidney development because it regulates
the adhesion of mesenchymal cells in contact with ureteric buds. Overexpression of Kif26b in
vitro caused increased cell adhesion through interactions with non-muscle myosin
(Terabayashi et al., 2012; Uchiyama et al., 2010).
Ankylosis, progressive homolog (mouse) (ANKH)
ANKH (human homolog of progressive ankylosis) regulates the transport of inorganic pyro
phosphate (PPi) through the cell membrane (Wang et al., 2008a). Some data suggest that
ANKH expression and function in vitro and in vivo are repressed in hypoxic environments
and that the effect is regulated by HIF-1 (Zaka et al., 2009). Human ANKH gene is expressed
in vivo in a tissue-specific manner, with highest levels of mRNA expression found in brain,
heart, and skeletal muscle (Guo et al., 2001). Mutations in the ANKH gene have been associ
ated with autosomal dominant craniometaphyseal dysplasia (Kornak et al., 2010). ANKH was
significantly upregulated in cervical cancer cell lines with amplifications as compared to cell
lines without amplifications (Kloth et al., 2007). Genomic amplification of regions on chro
mosome arm 5p has been observed frequently in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), implying the
presence of multiple oncogenes on this arm. Coe et al. described the identification of micro
deletions that have escaped detection by conventional screens and the identification TRIO and
ANKH as novel putative oncogenes (Coe et al., 2005).
Nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1)
In human cells, the mRNA export factor NXF1 resides in the nucleoplasm and at nuclear pore
complexes (Zhang et al., 2011 b). The transport of mRNA from the site of transcription in the
nucleus to the site of translation in the cytoplasm is an essential process in eukaryotic gene

  WO 2015/018805                                                            PCT/EP2014/066755
                                               - 19
expression. In human cells, the mRNA export factor NXF1 (also known as TAP) escorts
mRNA transcripts out of the nucleus by simultaneously binding mRNA, mRNA adaptor pro
teins, and phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats of the nuclear pore complex (Kelly and
Corbett, 2009). NXF1 is unique among nuclear transport factors, as it is a multidomain pro
tein that bears no structural or mechanistic resemblance to the karyopherin proteins that
transport protein cargos, tRNAs, and microRNAs through the NPC. mRNA export by NXF1
is a process that occurs independent of the GTPase Ran (Gruter et al., 1998). Nuclear export
of mRNPs is mediated by transport factors such as NXF 1 that bind mRNPs and mediate their
translocation through the central channel of nuclear pores (NPC) using transient interactions
with FG-nucleoporins (Wickramasinghe et al., 2010). mRNAs can be transported by either
bulk export pathways involving NXF 1/TAP or more specialized pathways involving chromo
some region maintenance 1 (CRM1) (Siddiqui and Borden, 2012).
Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4)
RGS4 acts as a GTPase accelerating protein to modulate pL-and 6- opioid receptor (MOR and
DOR, respectively) signaling. Opioid agonist-induced reduction in RGS4 occurs via the ubiq
uitin-proteasome pathway and may contribute to the maintenance of cell homeostasis in the
morphine-dependent state (Wang and Traynor, 2011). RGS4 plays an important role in regu
lating beta-cell function (Ruiz, I et al., 2010). Xie et al. suggested RGS4 as a novel suppres
sor of breast cancer migration and invasion, important steps of metastatic cascades (Xie et al.,
2009). RGS4 was overexpressed in thyroid carcinoma. The effective down-regulation of its
expression levels in thyroid cancer cells significantly attenuated viability of thyroid cancer
cells, indicating the significant role of RGS4 in thyroid carcinogenesis (Nikolova et al.,
2008). RGS4 was differentially expressed in a human pancreatic tumor cell line and found to
be a possible marker gene for local tumor invasion and liver metastases in pancreatic carci
noma (Niedergethmann et al., 2007). RGS4 overexpression delayed and altered lung epitheli
al cell tubulation by selectively inhibiting G protein-mediated p38 MAPK activation, and,
consequently, by reducing epithelial cell proliferation, migration, and expression of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Albig and Schiemann, 2005).
Glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2 (GFPT2)
GFPT2 is involved in neurite outgrowth, early neuronal cell development, neuropeptide sig
naling/synthesis and neuronal receptor (Tondreau et al., 2008). Genetic variants in GFPT2 are
associated with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy (Zhang et al., 2004). Furthermore,
the association of SNPs in GFPT2 suggests that the gene involved in modulation of oxidative
pathway could be major contributor to diabetic chronic renal insufficiency (Prasad et al.,
2010). DNA methylation of the GFPT2 gene was validated in primary acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) samples. Patients with methylation of multiple CpG islands had a worse
overall survival (Kuang et al., 2008). GFPT2 plays a role in glutamine metabolism and was
observed to be more highly expressed in mesenchymal cell lines. Glutamine metabolism may
play an important role in tumor progression and inhibitors of cellular metabolic pathways may
be a form of epigenetic therapy (Simpson et al., 2012).
Cerebral endothelial cell adhesion molecule (CERCAM)
CERCAM is localized at the surface of endothelial cells (Starzyk et al., 2000) and mapped on
chromosome 9q34. 11, a candidate region on 9q, identified as linked to familial idiopathic
scoliosis (Miller et al., 2012). The CEECAMI gene is widely transcribed in the nervous sys
tem and in several secretory tissues such as salivary glands, pancreas, liver and placenta
(Schegg et al., 2009).The CERCAM protein is structurally similar to the ColGalT enzymes
GLT25D1 and GLT25D2. But although its function is still not known, it seems to be is func-

  WO 2015/018805                                                              PCT/EP2014/066755

tionally different from the related GLT25D 1 protein, and the protein does not function as a
glycosyltransferase like GLT25D1 and GLT25D2 proteins (Perrin-Tricaud et al., 2011).
UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase 2
(Ga1NAc-T2) (GALNT2)
GALNT2, catalyze the first step in mucin-type 0-glycosylation of peptides in the Golgi appa
ratus. These enzymes transfer N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) from UDP-GalNAc to the
hydroxyl group of serine or threonine in target proteins (Peng et al., 2010). GALNT2 was
expressed constitutively and at low levels in most or all human adenocarcinoma cell lines
from pancreas, colon, stomach, and breast examined (Sutherlin et al., 1997). Studies have
shown that 0-glycans and GALNT genes play critical roles in a variety of biological func
tions and human disease development. Risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (Terry et al., 2010)
and coronary artery disease (Willer et al., 2008) have been associated with single nucleotide
polymorphisms of GALNT2. Aberrant glycosylation of cell surface glycoprotein due to spe
cific alterations of glycosyltransferase activity is usually associated with invasion and metas
tasis of cancer. GALNT2 is involved in tumor migration and invasion in gastric carcinomas
(Hua et al., 2012), in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Wu et al., 201 1b) and in human ma
lignant glioma (Liu et al., 2011 a).
Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (HNRNPM)
The HNRNPM gene belongs to the subfamily of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nucle
ar ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). HNRNPM is an abundant component of human hnRNP
complexes that can influence pre-mRNA splicing by regulating its own pre-mRNA splicing
(Hase et al., 2006) or by affecting the regulation of alternative splicing of fibroblast growth
factor receptor 2 (Hovhannisyan and Carstens, 2007). Proteomic analyses of in vitro purified
spliceosomes detected HNRNPM in the pre-spliceosomal H-complex and throughout the
spliceosome assembly (Rappsilber et al., 2002; Wahl et al., 2009). HNRNPM is involved in
the spliceosome machinery through its interaction with the CDC5L/PLRG1 spliceosomal sub
complex (Lleres et al., 2010). In human cancer cells, some results show that, cytoplasmic re
tention of IMP-3 and HNRNPM leads to significant drop in proliferation. A nuclear IMP-3
HNRNPM complex is important for the efficient synthesis of CCND 1, D3 and G 1 and for the
proliferation of human cancer cells (Rivera et al., 2013).
Basonuclin 1 (BNC1)
Basonuclin is a zinc-finger protein with a highly restricted tissue distribution (Tseng, 1998).
Thus far, basonuclin has been detected mainly in the basal keratinocytes of stratified squa
mous epithelia (skin, oral epithelium, esophagus, vagina, and cornea) and in the gametogenic
cells of the testis and ovary (Tseng and Green, 1994; Weiner and Green, 1998). There is now
considerable evidence that basonuclin is a cell-type-specific transcription factor for rRNA
genes (rDNA). The zinc fingers of basonuclin interact with three evolutionarily conserved
sites within the rDNA promoter (Iuchi and Green, 1999; Tseng et al., 1999). Epigenetic regu
lation by CpG methylation has an important role in tumorigenesis as well as in the response to
cancer therapy. BNCl was hypomethylated in radioresistant H1299 human non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Suppression of BNC1 rmRNA expression in H1299 cells also
reduced the resistance of these cells to ionizing radiation (Kim et al., 201 Oa). Aberrant DNA
methylation of BNC1 was also detected in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples
(Tong et al., 2010). In Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC), methylation of BNC1 was associated
with a poorer prognosis independent of tumor size, stage or grade (Morris et al., 2010).
FK506 binding protein 10, 65 kDa (FKBP1O)

 WO 2015/018805                                                               PCT/EP2014/066755
                                               - 21
FK506-binding protein 10 (FKBP1O) belongs to the FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans iso
merase family. It is located in endoplasmic reticulum and acts as molecular chaperones
(Ishikawa et al., 2008; Patterson et al., 2000). It is highly expressed in lung development and
can be reactivated in a coordinated manner with extracellular matrix proteins after lung injury
(Patterson et al., 2005).
Frizzled family receptor 1 (FZD1), frizzled family receptor 2 (FZD2), frizzled family
receptor 7 (FZD7)
The genes FZD2, FZD1 and FZD7 are all from the 'frizzled' gene family; members of this
gene family encode 7-transmembrane domain proteins that are receptors for Wnt signaling
proteins.
The expression of the FZD2 gene appears to be developmentally regulated, with high levels
of expression in fetal kidney and lung and in adult colon and ovary (Sagara et al., 1998; Zhao
et al., 1995).
The FZD1 protein contains a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich domain in the N-terminal extra
cellular region, 7 transmembrane domains, and a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif The
FZD1 transcript is expressed in various tissues, including lung as well as heart, kidney, pan
creas, prostate, and ovary (Sagara et al., 1998). The expression of frizzled 1 and 2 receptors
was found to be up-regulated in breast cancer (Milovanovic et al., 2004).
The FZD7 protein contains an N-terminal signal sequence, 10 cysteine residues typical of the
cysteine-rich extracellular domain of Fz family members, 7 putative transmembrane domains,
and an intracellular C-terminal tail with a PDZ domain-binding motif FZD7 gene expression
may downregulate APC function and enhance beta-catenin-mediated signals in poorly differ
entiated human esophageal carcinomas (Sagara et al., 1998; Tanaka et al., 1998).
ATPase, Ca++ transporting, cardiac muscle, fast twitch 1 (ATP2A1), ATPase, Ca++
transporting, cardiac muscle, fast twitch 2 (ATP2A2)
Both genes (ATP2A1 and ATP2A2) encode SERCA Ca(2+)-ATPases. Sarcoplasmic reticu
lum (SR)1/ER calcium ATPases (SERCAs) are calcium pumps that couple ATP hydrolysis
with calcium transport across the SR/ER membrane (MacLennan et al., 1997). SERCAs are
encoded by three homologous genes: SERCA1 (ATP2A1), SERCA2 (ATP2A2), and
SERCA3 (Wu et al., 1995). Some evidence has emerged to show that SERCA may also have
a direct impact on the processes of apoptosis, differentiation, and cell proliferation (Chami et
al., 2000; Ma et al., 1999; Sakuntabhai et al., 1999).
Mutations in ATP2A1, encoding SERCA1, cause some autosomal recessive forms of Brody
disease, characterized by increasing impairment of muscular relaxation during exercise
(Odermatt et al., 1996).
ATP2A2 is an ATPase associated with Darier's disease, a rare, autosomal dominant hereditary
skin disorder characterized by abnormal keratinization and acantholysis (Huo et al., 2010).
Germline alterations of ATP2A2 may predispose to lung and colon cancer and an impaired
ATP2A2 gene might be involved in carcinogenesis (Korosec et al., 2006). In a Small Cell
Lung Cancer (H1339) and an Adeno Carcinoma Lung Cancer (HCC) cell line the ER Ca2+
content was reduced compared to normal human bronchial epithelial. The reduced Ca2+
content correlated with a reduced expression of SERCA 2 pumping calcium into the ER
(Bergner et al., 2009). ATP2A2 could be potential prognostic markers for colorectal cancer

  WO 2015/018805                                                              PCT/EP2014/066755
                                               - 22
CRC patients. It was detected in circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and the postoperative relapse
was significantly correlated with gene overexpression (Huang et al., 2012).
Laminin, gamma 2 (LAMC2)
Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous con
stituent of basement membranes. They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological
processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and
metastasis. The LAMC2 gene encodes the laminin-5 y2 chain, which is part of laminin-5, one
of the major components of the basement membrane zone. LAMC2 was frequently up
regulation by promoter demethylation in gastric cancer (Kwon et al., 2011). LAMC2 was
found to be overexpressed in angiotropic melanoma areas vs. avascular melanoma areas
(Lugassy et al., 2009). LAMC2 is a biomarker of bladder cancer metastasis, and its expression
level was associated with tumor grade (Smith et al., 2009b). LAMB3 and LAMC2 genes were
co-expressed in 21 of 32 non-SCLC cell lines (66%) but only in one of 13 SCLC cell lines
(8%). Coexpression of the LAMB3 and LAMC2 genes was also observed in all 4 cases of
primary non-SCLC cells examined but not in the corresponding non-cancerous lung cells
(Manda et al., 2000).
Heat shock 70kDa protein 2 (HSPA2), heat shock 70kDa protein 8 (HSPA8)
HSPA2 has been identified as a potential cancer-promoting protein expressed at abnormal
levels in a subset of human cancers, such as breast cancer (Mestiri et al., 2001), cervical can
cer (Garg et al., 2010a), bladder urothelial cancer (Garg et al., 2010b), nasopharyngeal carci
noma (Jalbout et al., 2003) and malignant tumors (Chouchane et al., 1997). Some level of the
HSPA2 gene activity was also observed in cell lines derived from several human cancers
(Scieglinska et al., 2008), while silencing of the HSPA2 gene in cancer cells led to growth
arrest and decrease in tumorigenic potential (Rohde et al., 2005; Xia et al., 2008). Further
more, polymorphism in the HSPA2 gene is associated with an increase in the risk of develop
ing lung cancer (Wang et al., 20 1Ob). Overexpression of HSPA2 is correlated with increased
cell proliferation, poor differentiation and lymph node metastases in human breast cancer,
cervical cancer and bladder urothelial cancer (Garg et al., 2010a; Garg et al., 20 1Ob; Mestiri et
al., 2001).
The HSPA8 gene encodes a member of the heat shock protein 70 family Hsc70, which con
tains both heat-inducible and constitutively expressed members. HSPA8 binds to nascent pol
ypeptides to facilitate correct protein folding (Beckmann et al., 1990). Hsc70 function as mo
lecular chaperones, assisting in protein synthesis, folding, assembly, trafficking between cel
lular compartments, and degradation (Bukau and Horwich, 1998; Hartl and Hayer-Hartl,
2002). Hsc70 is expressed in non-malignant mammary cells as well as breast cancer cells
(Kao et al., 2003; Vargas-Roig et al., 1998) and the overexpression of Hsp/hsc70 in chemo
resistant cancer cells (Ciocca et al., 1992; Lazaris et al., 1997) has prompted studies about
possible clinical markers of these proteins (Ciocca and Calderwood, 2005). There is a poten
tial role of this secreted hsc70 chaperone in cell proliferation that might account for the higher
tumor growth of cancer cells overexpressing cathepsin D (Nirde et al., 2010). Furthermore
Ruisin et al. reported an association between a polymorphism of this gene and lung cancer
risk (Rusin et al., 2004).
Vacuolar protein sorting 13 homolog B (yeast) (VPS13B)
VPS13B was identified as a peripheral membrane protein localized to the Golgi complex,
where it overlaps with the cis-Golgi matrix protein GM130. Consistent with its subcellular
localization, VPS13B depletion using RNAi causes fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon into
ministacks (Seifert et al., 2011). Kolehmainen et al. (2003) identified the COHI gene, also
known as VPS13B, within the Cohen syndrome critical region on chromosome 8q22

  WO 2015/018805                                                            PCT/EP2014/066755
                                               - 23
(Kolehmainen et al., 2003). Loss-of-function mutations in the gene VPS13B lead to autoso
mal recessive Cohen syndrome (Seifert et al., 2011). Mutations of VPS13B and other genes
were described in gastric and colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability (An et al.,
2012).
CSE1 chromosome segregation 1-like (yeast) (CSE1L)
The cellular apoptosis susceptibility (CSE1L) gene has been demonstrated to regulate multi
ple cellular mechanisms including the mitotic spindle check point as well as proliferation and
apoptosis. CSE1L is located in both the cytoplasm and the nuclei of cells. Nuclear CSE1L
regulates the transcriptional activity of the p53 protein, a major tumor suppressor protein (Rao
et al., 2011; Tanaka et al., 2007). Cytoplasmic CSE1L is associated with microtubules; this
association has been shown to stimulate the extension of invadopodia and to enhance the mi
gration of tumor cells (Tai et al., 2010). CSE1L is highly expressed in most cancers, such as
benign and malignant cutaneous melanocytic lesions (Boni et al., 1999), endometrial carci
noma (Peiro et al., 2001), ovarian carcinoma (Brustmann, 2004), breast cancer (Behrens et al.,
2001), urinary bladder urothelial carcinomas (Chang et al., 2012), and its expression has been
shown to correlate with cancer progression. Silencing of CSE1L may be a potential therapeu
tic approach for colon cancer (Zhu et al., 2013).
Dihydropyrimidinase-like 4 (DPYSL4)
Dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 4 (DPYSL4) is a known regulator of hippocampal neu
ron development. DPYSL4 is involved in growth regulation, polarization and differentiation
of dental epithelial cells during tooth germ morphogenesis (Yasukawa et al., 2013). Some
studies showed DPYSL4's role in attenuating neurite outgrowth possibility through inhibiting
microtubule polymerization, and also revealed its novel association with vimentin during nu
clear condensation prior to neuronal death (Aylsworth et al., 2009). The p53 tumor suppressor
gene, which is frequently mutated in a wide variety of tumors, plays an important role in
maintaining genomic integrity. Both mRNA and protein expressions of DPYSL4 were specif
ically induced by anticancer agents in p53-proficient cells. DPYSL4 is an apoptosis-inducible
factor controlled by p53 in response to DNA damage (Kimura et al., 2011).
Sec61 gamma subunit (SEC61G)
SEC61y, a heterotrimeric protein channel comprising the subunits SEC61a, P, and y, is a
member of the SEC61 translocon (Greenfield and High, 1999). The SEC61 complex forms a
transmembrane pore for the translocation of nascent polypeptides into the ER lumen, as well
as the integration of transmembrane proteins into the ER bilayer (Osborne et al., 2005).
SEC61y is required for tumor cell survival, and for the cellular response to endoplasmic retic
ulum stress. Furthermore it is highly overexpressed in malignant cells and near absent in nor
mal cells (Lu et al., 2009). Knocking down SEC61y expression resulted in apoptosis and ab
rogation of EGFR/AKT survival signaling (Lu et al., 2009) as well as to growth inhibition of
the tumor cells (Neidert et al., 2012).
ORM1-like 1 (S. cerevisiae) (ORMDL1)
The human genes (ORMDL1, ORMDL2 and ORMDL3) are expressed ubiquitously in adult
and fetal tissues. They encode transmembrane proteins anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum
which are likely involved in protein folding in the ER. By genomic sequence analysis,
Hjelmqvist et al. (2002) mapped the ORMDL1 gene to chromosome 2q32.2 (Hjelmqvist et
al., 2002). ORMDL proteins are the primary regulators of ceramide biosynthesis in mammali
an cells (Siow and Wattenberg, 2012). ORMDL1 is specifically down-regulated in association
with presenilin 1 (PS1) mutations (Araki et al., 2008).

  WO 2015/018805                                                           PCT/EP2014/066755
                                             - 24
Pecanex-like 3 (Drosophila) (PCNXL3)
Pecanex-like protein 3 (PCNXL3) is a multi-pass membrane protein; it belongs to the pecanex
family.
The PCNXL3 gene was mapped to the chromosomal region 11ql2. 1-q13. Three novel human
tumor-associated translocation breakpoints were located in the chromosome 11ql3 region
between the markers DIlS4933 and DIlS546. Thus PCNXL3 might be a 11ql3-associated
disease gene (van et al., 2000).
Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 200kDa (U5) (SNRNP200)
Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a complex of specialized RNA and pro
tein subunits that removes introns from a transcribed pre-mRNA segment. The spliceosome
consists of small nuclear RNA proteins (snRNPs) Ul, U2, U4, U5 and U6, together with ap
proximately 80 conserved proteins. SNRNP200 is a gene required for unwinding of the
U4/U6 duplex, a step essential for catalytic activation of the spliceosome (Maeder et al.,
2009). SNRNP200 expression was detected in heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal mus
cle, kidney, and pancreas (Zhao et al., 2009). Mutations in SNRNP200 have recently been
discovered to be associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) (Benaglio et
al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012).
SAM domain, SH3 domain and nuclear localization signals 1 (SAMSN1)
SAMSN1 is a member of a novel gene family of putative adaptors and scaffold proteins con
taining SH3 and SAM (sterile alpha motif) domains. SAMSN1 is expressed in hematopoietic
tissues, muscle, heart, brain, lung, pancreas, endothelial cells and myelomas. Endogenous
SAMSN1 expression was shown to be up-regulated in primary B cells upon differentiation
and proliferation-inducing stimuli, and transduction experiments suggest a stimulatory role
for SAMSN1 in B cell differentiation to plasma cells (Brandt et al., 2010). Cell lines and pri
mary cells from acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma patients express SAMSN1
(Claudio et al., 2001). SAMSN1 was down-regulated in the large cell lung carcinoma cell line
Calu-6 (Yamada et al., 2008). SAMSNI was differentially expressed in ulcerative colitis
associated cancer (Watanabe et al., 2011).
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 2, 113kDa (STAT2)
STAT2 as a novel contributor to colorectal and skin carcinogenesis that may act to increase
the gene expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, which in turn activate the
oncogenic STAT3 signaling pathway (Gamero et al., 2010). STAT2 is a critical mediator in
the activation of type I IFN-induced apoptosis. More importantly, defects in the expression or
nuclear localization of STAT2 could lessen the efficacy of type I IFN immunotherapy
(Romero-Weaver et al., 2010). Lower expression of STAT2 in low grade astrocytomas were
detected when comparing with high grade astrocytomas. The results showed existing relation
ship between STAT and PPARgamma signaling in glial tumors and further support expected
important role of STATs in regulation of growth and differentiation in these tumors (Ehrmann
et al., 2008).
CCR4-NOT transcription complex, subunit 1 (CNOT1)
The human CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex consists of at least nine enzymatic and non
enzymatic subunits. CNOT1 has an important role in exhibiting enzymatic activity of the
CCR4-NOT complex, and thus is critical in control of mRNA deadenylation and mRNA de
cay. CNOT 1 depletion structurally and functionally deteriorates the CCR4-NOTcomplex and
induces stabilization of mRNAs, which results in the increment of translation causing ER
stress-mediated apoptosis. Ito et al. conclude that CNOT1 contributes to cell viability by se
curing the activity of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase (Ito et al., 2011). siRNA-mediated deple-

                                                - 25
tion of endogenous CNOT1 or other Ccr4-Not subunits in breast cancer cells results in dereg
ulation of ERalpha target genes (increased induction of ERa target genes TTFI and c-Myc).
These findings define a function for the human Ccr4-Not complex as a transcriptional re
pressor of nuclear receptor signaling that is relevant for the understanding of molecular path
ways involved in cancer (Winkler et al., 2006).
Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (mitochondrial) (SHMT2)
The SHMT2 gene encodes the mitochondrial form of a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent en
zyme that catalyzes the reversible reaction of serine and tetrahydrofolate to glycine and 5,10
methylene tetrahydrofolate. The encoded product is primarily responsible for glycine synthe
sis. In a polygenic disease such as lung cancer, gene-gene interactions are expected to play an
important role in determining the phenotypic variability of the diseases. Interactions between
MTHFR677, MTHFR1298, and SHMT polymorphisms may have a significant impact on
genetic instability in lung cancer patients. It was shown that with regard to cytogenetic altera
tions lymphocytes from lung cancer patients exposed to the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4
(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone [NNK] had considerably increased frequency
of cytogenetic damage in presence of MTHFR 677, MTHFR 1298, and SHMT allelic variants
(Piskac-Collier et al., 2011). Pharmacogenomic studies on the role of polymorphism of the
SHMT gene in the efficacy of 5-FU and FOLFIRI protocols of colorectal cancer patients re
vealed a significant effect resulting in altered overall survival as well (Timar et al., 2006).
Jun B proto-oncogene (JUNB)
JunB is a member of the AP-1 (activator protein-1) family of dimeric transcription factors.
The transcription factor AP-1 is involved in cellular proliferation, transformation and death
(Shaulian and Karin, 2002). JunB might be regulated through an NF-6B pathway and up
regulation of JunB induced by HGF might play an important role in the regulation of cell pro
liferation and cell invasion through MMP-9 expression (Lee and Kim, 2012). JunB seems to
play an oncogenic role in lymphomas, particularly in Hodgkin's lymphomas (Shaulian, 2010).
JunB is an essential upstream regulator of p16 and contributes to maintain cell senescence that
blocks malignant transformation of TAC. JunB thus apparently plays an important role in
controlling prostate carcinogenesis (Konishi et al., 2008). JunB promotes tumor invasiveness
and enhances angiogenesis in VHL-defective ccRCCs (Kanno et al., 2012).
Transforming, acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3 (TACC3)
TACC3 exists in a complex with ch-TOG (colonic and hepatic tumor over-expressed gene)
and clathrin that cross-links microtubules in kinetochore fibres. TACC3 is expressed in cer
tain proliferative tissues including testis, lung, spleen, bone marrow, thymus and peripheral
blood leukocytes. TACC3 expression is altered in some human tumor types. In cells, TACC3
is localized to both centrosomes and spindle microtubules but not at astral microtubules
(Hood and Royle, 2011). TACC3 expression was correlated with p53 expression, and patient
whose tumors highly expressed TACC3 and p53 had a significantly poorer prognosis than
patients whose tumors had low-level expression for both immunostainings (P = 0.006). It is
suggested that increase in TACC3 may impart a proliferative advantage to NSCLC and con
tribute to tumor progression, and that TACC3 expression is a strong prognostic indicator of
clinical outcome in NSCLC (Jung et al., 2006). Tacc3 may be a negative regulator of the
Notch signalling pathway (Bargo et al., 2010).
RAD54 homolog B (S. cerevisiae) (RAD54B)
DNA repair and recombination protein RAD54B is a protein that in humans is encoded by the
RAD54B gene. RAD54 binds to double-stranded DNA, and displays ATPase activity in the
presence of DNA. The human RAD54B protein is a paralog of the RAD54 protein, which

                                               - 26
plays important roles in homologous recombination. Homologous recombination (HR) is es
sential for the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Sarai et al., 2008).
Knockdown of RAD54B, a gene known to be somatically mutated in cancer, causes chromo
some instability (CIN) in mammalian cells (McManus et al., 2009). RAD54B elevated gene
expression is significantly associated with shorter time-to-progression and poor OS in GBM
patients (Grunda et al., 2010).
Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (EEF2)
EEF2 encodes a member of the GTP-binding translation elongation factor family. This pro
tein is an essential factor for protein synthesis. It promotes the GTP-dependent translocation
of the nascent protein chain from the A-site to the P-site of the ribosome. EEF2 was highly
expressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LADC), but not in the neighboring non-tumor lung tissue.
It is suggested that eEF2 is an anti-apoptotic marker in LADC, because patients with high
eEF2 expression had a significantly higher incidence of early tumor recurrence, and a signifi
cantly worse prognosis. Silencing of eEF2 expression increased mitochondrial elongation,
cellular autophagy and cisplatin sensitivity. Moreover, eEF2 was SUMOylated in LADC
cells, and eEF2 SUMOylation correlated with drug resistance (Chen et al., 2011 a). EEF2 is an
attractive target for cancer therapy because inhibiting EEF2 causes the rapid arrest of protein
synthesis, inducing apoptosis and leading ultimately to cell death. siRNA-induced silencing of
EEF2 resulted in specific cytotoxicity of tumor cells (Chen et al., 201 1b; Wullner et al.,
2008).
Cyclin A2 (CCNA2)
CCNA2 belongs to the highly conserved cyclin family. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK
kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which contrib
ute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event (Deshpande et al., 2005). Human cyclin
A2 is a key regulator of S phase progression and entry into mitosis. CCNA2 binds and acti
vates CDC2 or CDK2 kinases, and thus promotes both cell cycle G1/S and G2/M transitions
(Honda et al., 2012). Mutations, amplifications and overexpression of this gene, which alters
cell cycle progression, are observed frequently in a variety of tumors and may contribute to
tumorigenesis (Cooper et al., 2009; Kars et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2011; Tompkins et al.,
2011). Furthermore, it is described that CCNA2 expression is associated with a poor progno
sis in several types of cancer (Yasmeen et al., 2003) and that elevated expression of cyclin A
correlated to shorter survival periods (Dobashi et al., 1998).
Neuroepithelial cell transforming 1 (NET1) 41
NETI is part of the family of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Members of this fam
ily activate Rho proteins by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP. The protein encoded by
NETl interacts with RhoA within the cell nucleus and may play a role in repairing DNA
damage after ionizing radiation.
The NETJ gene, but not opioid receptors, is expressed in breast adenocarcinoma cells and
may facilitate their migration (Ecimovic et al., 2011). NETI is up-regulated in gastric cancer
(GC) tissue and drives the invasive phenotype of this disease (Srougi and Burridge, 2011).
NET 1 plays an important role in GC cell migration and invasion, key aspects of GC progres
sion (Bennett et al., 2011). The higher expressions of RhoC and NETI in human prostate can
cers after short-term endocrine therapy suggest that RhoC and NETI may become therapeutic
targets during endocrine therapy (Kawata et al., 2012).
Chromosome 11 open reading frame 24 (Cllorf24)

  WO 2015/018805                                                              PCT/EP2014/066755
                                                - 27
C 11orf24 was identified by Twells et al (2001). The C lorf24 gene has no known similarity
to other genes, and its function is unknown. Northern blot analysis detected high expression
of a 1.9-kb transcript in heart, placenta, liver, pancreas, and colon. Lower levels were detected
in brain, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, spleen, prostate, testis, ovary, and small intestine, and
very low levels were detected in thymus and leukocytes (Twells et al., 2001). The 449 amino
acid long protein C 1orf24 is located on the chromosomal region 1 1q13. This region is de
scribed as a multi-cancer susceptibility region (Gudmundsson et al., 2009; Purdue et al.,
2011).
Regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1)
Regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1) is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor
for Ran GTPase. Localised generation of Ran-GTP by RCC1 on chromatin is critical for nu
cleocytoplasmic transport, mitotic spindle assembly and nuclear envelope formation
(Hitakomate et al., 2010). Some data suggested that chromosomal binding of the mitotic regu
lators such as RCC1, Mad2 and survivin is essential for mitotic progression (Ho et al., 2008).
Wong et al. have found that the nuclear RanGTP level is diminished during the early stages of
apoptosis, which correlates with immobilization of RCC1 on the chromosomes. Therefore,
they propose that RCC1 reads the histone code created by caspase-activated Mstl to initiate
apoptosis by reducing the level of RanGTP in the nucleus (Wong et al., 2009).
Melanoma antigen family F, 1 (MAGEFI)
Most known members of the MAGE (melanoma-associated antigen) superfamily are ex
pressed in tumors, testis and fetal tissues, which has been described as a cancer/testis expres
sion, pattern (MAGE subgroup I). Peptides of MAGE subgroup I have been successfully used
in peptide and DC vaccination (Nestle et al., 1998; Marchand et al., 1999; Marchand et al.,
1999; Marchand et al., 1995; Thumer et al., 1999). In contrast, some MAGE genes (MAGE
subgroup II), such as MAGEF 1, are expressed ubiquitously in all adult and fetal tissues tested
and also in many tumor types including ovarian, breast, cervical, melanoma and leukemia
(Nestle et al., 1998; Marchand et al., 1999; Marchand et al., 1999; Marchand et al., 1995;
Thurner et al., 1999). Nevertheless, overexpression of MAGEF1 could be detected in NSCLC
(Tsai et al., 2007) and in 79 % of a cohort of Taiwanese colorectal cancer patients (Chung et
al., 2010).
Non-SMC condensin I complex, subunit D2 (NCAPD2)
Condensins are heteropentameric complexes that were first identified as structural compo
nents of mitotic chromosomes. NCAPD2 is an essential component of the human condensin
complex required for mitotic chromosome condensation. NCAPD2 depletion affects chromo
some alignment in metaphase and delays entry into anaphase (Watrin and Legagneux, 2005).
Recent linkage and association studies have implicated the chromosome l2p13 locus as pos
sibly harboring genetic variants predisposed to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Single marker asso
ciation revealed the two SNPs in NCAPD2 (rs7311174 and rs2072374) as showing nominal
significant p values (p = 0.0491 and 0.0116, respectively). These genetic analyses provide
evidence that the chromosome 12p 13 locus is associated with AD in Chinese (Li et al., 2009).
Chromosome 12 open reading frame 44 (Cl2orf44)
By searching databases for orthologs of a Drosophila Atg 13-interacting protein, Mercer et al.
(2009) identified human ATG101, also known as Cl2orf44 (Mercer et al., 2009). The
ATG101 gene was mapped to chromosome 12ql3.13. The deduced 218 amino acid protein
was predicted to be a cytosolic hydrophilic protein (Hosokawa et al., 2009). Macroautophagy
is a catabolic process for lysosome-mediated degradation of cytoplasmic proteins, organelles,
and macromolecules. ATG proteins, such as ATGO1, are required for formation of autopha-

  WO 2015/018805                                                               PCT/EP2014/066755
                                               - 28
gosomes, double-membrane vesicles that surround and sequester cytoplasmic cargo prior to
fusion with lysosomes. ATG101 (C12orf44) is essential for autophagy (Mercer et al., 2009).
HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 4 (HERC4)
HERC4 belongs to the HERC family of ubiquitin ligases, all of which contain a HECT do
main and at least 1 RCC1 (MIM 179710)-like domain (RLD). The 350-amino acid HECT
domain is predicted to catalyze the formation of a thioester with ubiquitin before transferring
it to a substrate, and the RLD is predicted to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for
small G proteins (Hochrainer et al., 2005). E3 ubiquitin ligase Herc4, though ubiquitously
expressed in all tissues, is most highly expressed in the testis, specifically during spermiogen
esis. Herc4 ligase is required for proper maturation and removal of the cytoplasmic droplet for
the spermatozoon to become fully functional (Rodriguez and Stewart, 2007).
Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3)
IGF2BP3 is a member of the insulin-like growth factor-II mRNA-binding protein family, im
plicated in mRNA localization, turnover and translational control. The protein contains sever
al KH (K-homologous) domains, which are important in RNA binding and are known to be
involved in RNA synthesis and metabolism. Expression occurs mainly during embryonic de
velopment and has been described for some tumors. Thus, IGF2BP3 is considered to be an
oncofoetal protein (Liao et al., 2005). IGF2BP3 may promote tumor cell proliferation by en
hancing IGF-II protein synthesis and by inducing cell adhesion and invasion through stabili
zation of CD44 mRNA (Findeis-Hosey and Xu, 2012). Moreover, IGF2BP3 expression has
been studied in many human neoplasms with growing evidence that it mediates migration,
invasion, cell survival and tumor metastasis (Jeng et al., 2009; Kabbarah et al., 2010; Li et
al., 2011; Liao et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2011; Hwang et al., 2012; Samanta et al., 2012) and it
might also be implicated in angiogenesis (Suvasini et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012). In lung
adenocarcinomas, a higher frequency of IGF2BP3 expression can be detected in moderately
or poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, which may be associated with an aggressive bio
logical behavior (Findeis-Hosey et al., 2010; Beljan et al., 2012; Findeis-Hosey and Xu,
2012).
Cell division cycle 6 homolog (S. cerevisiae) (CDC6)
CDC6 protein functions as a regulator at the early steps of DNA replication. It localizes in
cell nucleus during cell cycle GI, but translocates to the cytoplasm at the start of S phase.
Further, CDC6 is supposed to regulate replication-checkpoint activation through the interac
tion with ATR in higher eukaryotic cells (Yoshida et al., 2010). CDC6 is essential for DNA
replication and its deregulation is involved in carcinogenesis. It was found that CDC6 down
regulation by RNA interference (RNAi) prevented cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis
(Lau et al., 2006). Overexpression of CDC6 was found in several cancers. Among the cancer
types overexpressing CDC6 are gastric cancer (Tsukamoto et al., 2008), brain tumors (Ohta
et al., 2001), oral squamous cell carcinoma (Feng et al., 2008), cervical carcinoma (Wang et
al., 2009b) and malignant mesothelioma (Romagnoli et al., 2009).
Fibroblast activation protein, alpha (FAP)
Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a type II integral membrane glycoprotein belonging to
the serine protease family. The putative seine protease activity of FAP alpha and its in vivo
induction pattern may indicate a role for this molecule in the control of fibroblast growth or
epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during development, tissue repair, and epithelial carcino
genesis (Scanlan et al., 1994). Most normal adult tissues and benign epithelial tumors show
little or no detectable FAP expression. However, FAP expression is detected in the stroma of
over 90% of malignant breast, colorectal, lung, skin and pancreatic tumors, fibroblasts of

  WO 2015/018805                                                              PCT/EP2014/066755
                                              - 29
healing wounds, soft tissue sarcomas, and some fetal mesenchymal cells. FAP has a potential
role in cancer growth and metastasis through cell adhesion and migration processes, as well as
rapid degradation of ECM components. Thus, it is present on tumor cells invading the ECM,
and endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis, but is not expressed in inactive cells of the
same type (Dolznig et al., 2005; Kennedy et al., 2009; Rettig et al., 1993; Rettig et al., 1994;
Scanlan et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 2010a).
Wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 5A (WNT5A)
In general, Wnt5a regulates a variety of cellular functions, such as proliferation, differentia
tion, migration, adhesion and polarity (Kikuchi et al., 2012). It is expressed in undifferentiated
human embryonic stem cells (Katoh, 2008). WNT5A is classified as a non-transforming
WNT family member whose role in carcinogenesis is still ambiguous. It exhibits tumor sup
pressor activities in some cancers (thyroid, brain, breast and colorectum), but is aberrantly up
regulated in cancers of lung, stomach and prostate (Li et al., 2010). Oncogenic WNT5A acti
vates canonical WNT signaling in cancer stem cells for self-renewal, and non-canonical WNT
signaling at the tumor-stromal interface for invasion and metastasis (Katoh and Katoh, 2007).
Expression of WNT5A has been described for a variety of tumor entities. For example, ab
normal protein expression of Wnt5a was observed in 28% of prostate cancer where it pro
motes aggressiveness (Yamamoto et al., 2010). Furthermore, WNT5A over-expression is
described to be associated with poor prognosis and/or increasing tumor grade in ovarian can
cer (Badiglian et al., 2009), melanoma (Da Forno et al., 2008; Weeraratna et al., 2002), GBM
(Yu et al., 2007), lung cancer (Huang et al., 2005) and pancreatic cancer (Ripka et al., 2007).
In HCC, it seems that the canonical Wnt signaling pathway contributes to tumor initiation and
the noncanonical signaling to tumor progression (Yuzugullu et al., 2009).
TPX2, microtubule-associated, homolog (Xenopus laevis) (TPX2)
TPX2 is a spindle assembly factor. It is required for normal assembly of mitotic spindles and
of microtubules during apoptosis. TPX2 is required for chromatin and/or kinetochore depend
ent microtubule nucleation (Bird and Hyman, 2008; Moss et al., 2009). Newly synthesized
TPX2 is required for nearly all Aurora A activation and for full p53 synthesis and phosphory
lation in vivo during oocyte maturation (Pascreau et al., 2009). TPX2 is a cell cycle
associated protein which is overexpressed in many tumor types, such as meningiomas (Stuart
et al., 2010), squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx (SCCL) (Cordes et al., 2010), oral squa
mous cell carcinomas (SCC) (Shigeishi et al., 2009), hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC)
(Satow et al., 2010), pancreatic tumor (Warner et al., 2009), ovarian cancer (Ramakrishna et
al., 2010), squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (Lin et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2006). It is fre
quently co-overexpressed with Aurora-A giving rise to a novel functional unit with oncogenic
properties (Asteriti et al., 2010). TPX2 expression is a prognostic indicator in lung cancer
(Kadara et al., 2009).
Hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (RHAMM) (HMMR)
The receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility RHAMM (HMMR) exerts different functions
in the cell as well as on the cell membrane. RHAMM can be exported to the cell surface
where it binds hyaluronic acid (HA) and interacts with the HA receptor CD44. Processes like
cell motility, wound healing and invasion are modulated by RHAMM (Sohr and Engeland,
2008). RHAMM (receptor for HYA-mediating motility) is one of the receptors for hyaluronan
(HYA) (Gares and Pilarski, 2000). Also cancer cells exhibit binding sites (CD44, RHAMM,
etc.) for HYA and HYA protects cancer cells against immune cell attack. Serum HYA is often
increased in metastatic patients (Delpech et al., 1997). In addition, HYA-interaction with
RHAMM (HMMR) and CD44 on cancer cells has been proposed to be important in promot
ing tumor progression and dissemination (Li et al., 2000b). Furthermore, RHAMM is over-

                                               - 30
expressed in several cancer tissues (Tzankov et al., 2011); (Kramer et al., 2010); (Twarock et
al., 2010); (Shigeishi et al., 2009); (Zlobec et al., 2008); (Li et al., 2000a)).
ADAM metallopeptidase domain 8 (ADAM8)
ADAM8 is a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain) family. Many
ADAM species, including ADAM8, are expressed in human malignant tumors, where they
are involved in the regulation of growth factor activities and integrin functions, leading to
promotion of cell growth and invasion (Mochizuki and Okada, 2007). The expression of
ADAM8 was positively correlated to EGFR. Both were mainly expressed in the cytoplasm
and on the cell membrane (Wu et al., 2008). ADAM8 was abundantly expressed in the great
majority of lung cancers examined. Exogenous expression of ADAM8 increased the migrato
ry activity of mammalian cells, an indication that ADAM8 may play a significant role in pro
gression of lung cancer (Ishikawa et al., 2004). ADAM8 has been associated with poor prog
nosis of lung cancer (Hernandez et al., 2010). ADAM8 over-expression was associated with
shorter patient survival and it was a good predictor of distant metastases in RCC (Roemer et
al., 2004b; Roemer et al., 2004a). In addition, expression levels and the protease activities of
ADAM8 correlated with invasive activity of glioma cells, indicating that ADAM8 may play a
significant role in tumor invasion in brain cancer (Wildeboer et al., 2006).
Collagen alpha-3(VI) chain protein (COL6A3)
COL6A3 encodes the alpha-3 chain, one of the three alpha chains of type VI collagen. The
protein domains have been shown to bind extracellular matrix proteins, an interaction that
explains the importance of this collagen in organizing matrix components.
Remodeling of the extracellular matrix through overexpression of collagen VI contributes to
cis-platin resistance in ovarian cancer cells. The presence of collagen VI correlated with tu
mor grade, an ovarian cancer prognostic factor (Sherman-Baust et al., 2003). COL6A3 is
overexpressed in colorectal tumor (Smith et al., 2009a), salivary gland carcinoma (Leivo et
al., 2005) and differentially expressed in gastric cancer (Yang et al., 2007). COL6A3 was
identified as one of seven genes with tumor-specific splice variants. The validated tumor
specific splicing alterations were highly consistent, enabling clear separation of normal and
cancer samples and in some cases even of different tumor stages (Thorsen et al., 2008).
Thy-1 cell surface antigen (THYl)
Thy-i (CD90) is a 25-37 kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycol-protein
expressed on many cell types, including T cells, thymocytes, neurons, endothelial cells, and
fibroblasts. Activation of Thy-i can promote T cell activation. Thy-i also affects numerous
non-immunologic biological processes, including cellular adhesion, neurite outgrowth, tumor
growth, tumor suppression, migration, wound healing and cell death. Thy-i is an important
regulator of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, with important roles in nerve regeneration,
metastasis, inflammation, and fibrosis (Rege and Hagood, 2006b; Rege and Hagood, 2006a).
Furthermore, Thy-I appears to be a marker of adult but not embryonic angiogenesis. The up
regulation of Thy-i by cytokines but not growth factors indicates the importance of inflam
mation in the pathogenesis of adult angiogenesis (Lee et al., 1998). There is a significant
overexpression of Thy-i located in the lung cancer cell nucleus as compared to the normal
tissue or benign tumor cells of lung, and it is one of the factors related to the prognosis of
NSCLC patients. Thus, Thy-i may be a novel latent malignant marker in the lung cancer pa
thology (Chen et al., 2005b). Thy-i can be considered as a surrogate marker for various kind
of stem cells (mesenchymal stem cells, hepatic stem cells ("oval cells") (Masson et al., 2006),
keratinocyte stem cells (Nakamura et al., 2006) and hematopoietic stem cells (Yamazaki et
al., 2009).

Deiodinase, iodothyronine, type II (DI02)
The protein encoded by the D102 gene belongs to the iodothyronine deiodinase family. It is
highly expressed in the thyroid, and may contribute significantly to the relative increase in
thyroidal T3 production in patients with Graves' disease and thyroid adenomas (Meyer et al.,
2008); (de Souza Meyer et al., 2005)). The gene expression patterns are significantly different
between upward and downward progressing types of nasopharygeal carcinoma (NPC). The
expression of D102 gene is higher in the downward progressing type (downward = distant
metastasis) than in upward progressing type (local growth and invasion of the base of skull),
which may be closely related to the metastasis potential of NPC (Liang et al., 2008). D102
mRNA as well as D102 activity is expressed in brain tumors (Murakami et al., 2000). D2 ac
tivity in lung is present and similar in peripheral lung and lung cancer tissue (Wawrzynska et
al., 2003).
Periostin, osteoblast specific factor (POSTN)
POSTN, a gene encoding a protein with similarity to the fasciclin family and involved in cell
survival and angiogenesis, has emerged as a promising marker for tumor progression in vari
ous types of human cancers (Ruan et al., 2009).
High expression of periostin protein or mRNA was detected in most solid tumors including
breast (Zhang et al., 2010b), colon (Kikuchi et al., 2008), head and neck (Kudo et al., 2006),
pancreatic (Kanno et al., 2008), papillary thyroid (Puppin et al., 2008), prostate (Tischler et
al., 2010), ovarian (Choi et al., 2010), lung (Takanami et al., 2008) and liver (Utispan et al.,
2010) carcinoma, as well as oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Kwon et al., 2009). Peri
ostin is abnormally highly expressed in lung cancer and is correlated with angiogenesis, inva
sion and metastasis (Takanami et al., 2008). Silencing of periostin in A549 non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) cells inhibits tumor cell growth and decrease cell invasion (Wu et al.,
2013).
SLITI (slit homolog 1 (Drosophila)), SLIT2 (slit homolog 2 (Drosophila))
SLITs (SLITI, SLIT2, and SLIT3) are a family of secreted proteins that mediate positional
interactions between cells and their environment during development by signaling through
ROBO receptors (Hinck, 2004). SLIT/ROBO signaling, however, is not restricted to devel
opment, and loss of these cues likely plays an important role during tumor progression. Slits
and Robos are considered candidate tumor suppressor genes because their promoters are fre
quently hypermethylated in epithelial cancers (Narayan et al., 2006; Schmid et al., 2007;
Latil et al., 2003). In ~50% of sampled human breast tumors, SLIT2 or SLIT3 gene expres
sion is silenced (Sharma et al., 2007). Hypermethylation of SLIT2 was frequently detected in
NSCLCs and associated with various clinical features (Suzuki et al., 2013).
TLX3 (T-cell leukemia homeobox 3)
TLX3 (also known as RNX or HOX 11L2) belongs to a family of orphan homeobox genes
that encode DNA-binding nuclear transcription factors. Members of the HOX 11 gene family
are characterized by a threonine-47 replacing cytosine in the highly conserved homeodomain
(Dear et al., 1993). TLX3 is uniquely expressed in the developing medulla oblongata and is
required for proper formation of first-order relay visceral sensory neurons and of most of the
(nor) adrenergic centers in the brainstem, especially involved in the physiologic control of
cardiovascular and respiratory systems (Qian et al., 2001). Expression of TLX3 has also been
detected in leukaemia samples from 20% of children and 13% of adults affected with T-cell
acute lymphocytic leukaemia (Cave et al., 2004), although this gene has never been involved
in normal T-cell differentiation (Ferrando et al., 2004).

CEP192 (centrosomal protein 192kDa)
Centrosomes play an important role in various cellular processes, including spindle formation
and chromosome segregation. CEP192 is a centrosome protein that plays a critical role in cen
trosome biogenesis and function in mammals, Drosophila and C. elegans (Gomez-Ferreria et
al., 2012). It stimulates the formation of the scaffolding upon which gamma tubulin ring com
plexes and other proteins involved in microtubule nucleation and spindle assembly become
functional during mitosis (Gomez-Ferreria et al., 2007).
ANKS1A (ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif domain containing 1A)
Ankyrin repeat and SAM domain-containing protein 1A is a protein that in humans is encod
ed by the ANKS1A gene (Nagase et al., 1996). ANKS1A has been first described as a target
and signal transmitter of receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR and PDGFR (Pandey et al.,
2002) and more recently as an interaction partner of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA8 (Shin
et al., 2007). In a recent study, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in
348 advanced NSCLC patients. They identified 17 top candidate SNPs related to prognosis.
SNPs were located in the genomic region of the ANKS1A gene (Lee et al., 2013).
CEP250 (centrosomal protein 250kDa)
The CEP250 gene encodes a core centrosomal protein required for centriole-centriole cohe
sion during interphase of the cell cycle (Mayor et al., 2002). By radiation hybrid analysis, Fry
et al. (1998) mapped the CEP250 gene to the centromeric region of chromosome 20, at ap
proximately 20qll.2 (Fry et al., 1998). Mayor et al. (2002) found that overexpression of
CEP250 in a human osteosarcoma cell line resulted in formation of large centrosome
associated structures. CEP250 overexpression did not interfere with centrosome separation or
cell division, however, indicating that cell cycle-regulated activity dissociates CEP250 from
centrosomes (Mayor et al., 2002).
MDN1 (MDN1, midasin homolog (yeast))
MDN1, midasin homolog (yeast) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MDN1 gene.
Midasin is present as a single-copy gene encoding a well-conserved protein of approximately
600 kDa in all eukaryotes for which data are available. In humans, the gene maps to 6ql5 and
encodes a predicted protein of 5596 residues (632 kDa) (Garbarino and Gibbons, 2002). Re
cently, MDN1 was found to be mutated in breast cancers of the luminal B subtype. MDN1
may play a role in the development and hormone resistance of this aggressive subtype
(Cornen et al., 2014).
OLFM1 (olfactomedin 1)
OLFM1, also called Noelin-1, is a secreted glycoprotein belonging to a family of olfactome
din domain-containing proteins and plays an important role in regulating the production of
neural crest cells by the neural tube (Barembaum et al., 2000). Olfactomedin was originally
identified as the major component of the mucus layer that surrounds the chemosensory den
drites of olfactory neurons (Kulkami et al., 2000). Expression of olfactomedin 1 protein was
significantly higher in lung adenocarcinoma than in lung cancer of other histologic types and
normal lung tissues (Wu et al., 2010). Furthermore, OLFMI is deregulated in the endometrial
cancer, Ewing's sarcoma, and neuroblastoma (Wong et al., 2007; Allander et al., 2002; Khan
et al., 2001).
BUBIB (budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1 homolog beta (yeast))

  WO 2015/018805                                                            PCT/EP2014/066755
                                              - 33
BUB1B, also named BubRI, is a core mitotic checkpoint component that binds to and inhibits
the Cdc20-activated anaphase-promoting complex (APC/CCdc20), a ubiquitin E3 ligase that
initiates anaphase by orchestrating separase-mediated cleavage of cohesion rings that hold
sister chromatids together (Baker et al., 2004). BubRi not only contributes to proper chromo
some segregation through mitotic checkpoint activation but also by regulation of chromo
some-spindle attachments (Malureanu et al., 2009; Lampson and Kapoor, 2005). Impaired
spindle checkpoint function has been found in many forms of cancer. Mutations in BubRI
have been associated with mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA), a rare human syndrome
characterized by aneuploidization, tumor predisposition, and several progeroid traits, includ
ing short lifespan, growth and mental retardation, cataracts, and facial dysmorphisms
(Matsuura et al., 2006).
PI4KA (phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, catalytic, alpha)
Four different phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PI4Ks) are expressed in human cells. These
isoenzymes (PI4KA, P14KB, PI4K2A and PI4K2B) catalyze the phosphorylation of phospha
tidylinositol (Ptdlns) in the cytoplasmic face of cellular membranes, leading to the production
of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) (Minogue and Waugh, 2012). PI4KA is main
ly found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Its activity seems to regulate both the formation
of ER exit sites (Blumental-Perry et al., 2006) and the concentration of PtdIns4P in the plas
ma membrane (Balla et al., 2008). A research group has found that PI4KA mRNA was more
abundant in HCC than normal healthy tissues. This up-regulation correlated significantly with
both poor differentiation and the active proliferation rate in HCC. Therefore PI4KA could be
used as a new molecular marker to improve established prognostic models for HCC (Ilboudo
et al., 2014).
AURKB (aurora kinase B)
Aurora B kinase is a protein that functions in the attachment of the mitotic spindle to the cen
tromere (Kim et al., 2011). AURKB localizes to microtubules near kinetochores (Kunitoku et
al., 2003). Aurora kinases are over-expressed in a variety of tumor cell lines, suggesting that
these kinases might play a role in tumorigenesis, and have already become potential targets
for cancer diagnosis and therapy (Fu et al., 2007). Recently a gene signature of five genes
(TOP2A, AURKB, BRRN1, CDK1 and FUS) that are closely associated with the outcomes in
patients with NSCLC was identified. The results suggested that genes involved in chromo
some condensation, like AURKB, are likely related with stem-like properties and might pre
dict survival in lung adenocarcinoma (Perumal et al., 2012).
SLC3A2 (solute carrier family 3 (activators of dibasic and neutral amino acid
transport), member 2)
SLC3A2 comprises the light subunit of the large neutral amino acid transporter (LATI) that is
also known as CD98 (cluster of differentiation 98) (Lemaitre et al., 2005). The CD98 hetero
dimer consists of a type II single-pass transmembrane heavy chain (CD98hc, also known as
4F2 antigen heavy chain or FRP-1; encoded by the genes SLC3A2 and Slc3a2 for human and
mouse, respectively) of -80-85 kDa that is disulfide-linked with a multi-pass light chain of
 -40 kDa (Deves and Boyd, 2000). CD98hc functions in amplifying integrin signalling and in
the transport of amino acids; both of these functions can contribute to cell survival and prolif
eration (Cantor and Ginsberg, 2012). Many tumors express CD98hc (SLC3A2), and its ex
pression correlates with poor prognosis in B cell lymphomas. Furthermore, nearly all studies
that have examined the expression of CD98hc or CD98 light chains in solid tumors show that
their expression is correlated with progressive or metastatic tumors (Kaira et al., 2009).
IFT81 (intraflagellar transport 81 homolog (Chiamydomonas))

 WO 2015/018805                                                              PCT/EP2014/066755
                                              - 34
Intraflagellar transport (IFT) of ciliary precursors such as tubulin from the cytoplasm to the
ciliary tip is involved in the construction of the cilium, a hairlike organelle found on most
eukaryotic cells. Knockdown of IFT81 and rescue experiments with point mutants showed
that tubulin binding by IFT81 was required for ciliogenesis in human cells (Bhogaraju et al.,
2013). Together with IFT74/72, IFT81 forms a core complex to build IFT particles which are
required for cilium formation (Lucker et al., 2005).
COG4 (component of oligomeric golgi complex 4)
The COG complex consists of eight subunits named COG1-8 (Ungar et al., 2002; Whyte and
Munro, 2001) grouped into two sub-complexes: COG1-4 (Lobe A) and COG5-8 (Lobe B)
(Ungar et al., 2005). The COG complex functions in the tethering of vesicles recycling resi
dent Golgi proteins (such as glycosylation enzymes) (Pokrovskaya et al., 2011). The COG4
gene maps to chromosome 16q22.1 (Reynders et al., 2009). Ungar et al. (2002) concluded
that COG4 is critical for the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus and can influence
intracellular membrane trafficking (Ungar et al., 2002).
NCBP1 (nuclear cap binding protein subunit 1, 8OkDa)
Nuclear cap-binding protein complex is a RNA-binding protein which binds to the 5' cap of
RNA polymerase II. Kataoka et al. (1994) described the cloning of a gene that encodes an 80
kD nuclear cap-binding protein (NCBP1) found in HeLa cell nuclear extracts that may be
involved in mRNA splicing and RNA export (Kataoka et al., 1994). By hybridizing to ge
nomic DNA from a somatic cell hybrid panel, Chadwick et al. (1996) mapped the NCBP1
gene to 9q34.1 (Chadwick et al., 1996).
NEFH (neurofilament, heavy polypeptide)
The NEFH encoding neurofilament heavy chain is one of the major components of the neu
ronal cytoskeleton neurofilaments. The neurofilament heavy polypeptide (NEFH, 200 kD)
gene resides at chromosomal band 2 2 q1 2 .2 and was proposed as a DNA marker for presymp
tomatic diagnosis in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) families. Loss or down-regulation of
NEFH has been mostly reported in human autonomic nerve tumors or central neurocytomas
(Mena et al., 2001; Segal et al., 1994). In addition, absent or diminished NEFH expression in
human prostate cancer (Schleicher et al., 1997), clear-cell epithelioid tumor (Tanaka et al.,
2000), and small cell lung carcinoma (Bobos et al., 2006) has been observed. Interestingly,
over-expression of NEFH disrupted normal cell structure and function, and induced cell death
(Szebenyi et al., 2002).
Detailed description of the invention
As used herein and except as noted otherwise all terms are defined as given below.
The term "peptide" is used herein to designate a series of amino acid residues, connected one
to the other typically by peptide bonds between the alpha-amino and carbonyl groups of the
adjacent amino acids. The peptides are preferably 9 amino acids in length, but can be as short
as 8 amino acids in length, and as long as 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14 and in case of MHC class II
peptides they can be as long as 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20 amino acids in length.
Further the term "peptide" shall include salts of a series of amino acid residues, connected one
to the other typically by peptide bonds between the alpha-amino and carbonyl groups of the
adjacent amino acids. Preferably the salts are pharmaceutical acceptable salts.

  WO 2015/018805                                                            PCT/EP2014/066755
                                               - 35
The term "peptide" shall include "oligopeptide". The term "oligopeptide" is used herein to
designate a series of amino acid residues, connected one to the other typically by peptide
bonds between the alpha-amino and carbonyl groups of the adjacent amino acids. The length
of the oligopeptide is not critical to the invention, as long as the correct epitope or epitopes
are maintained therein. The oligopeptides are typically less than about 30 amino acid residues
in length, and greater than about 15 amino acids in length.
The term "the peptides of the present invention" shall include the peptides consisting of or
comprising a peptide as defined above according to SEQ ID No. 1 to SEQ ID No. 92.
The term "polypeptide" designates a series of amino acid residues, connected one to the other
typically by peptide bonds between the alpha-amino and carbonyl groups of the adjacent ami
no acids. The length of the polypeptide is not critical to the invention as long as the correct
epitopes are maintained. In contrast to the terms peptide or oligopeptide, the term polypeptide
is meant to refer to molecules containing more than about 30 amino acid residues.
A peptide, oligopeptide, protein or polynucleotide coding for such a molecule is "immuno
genic" (and thus is an "immunogen" within the present invention), if it is capable of inducing
an immune response. In the case of the present invention, immunogenicity is more specifical
ly defined as the ability to induce a T-cell response. Thus, an "immunogen" would be a mole
cule that is capable of inducing an immune response, and in the case of the present invention,
a molecule capable of inducing a T-cell response. In another aspect, the immunogen can be
the peptide, the complex of the peptide with MHC, oligopeptide, and/or protein that is used to
raise specific antibodies or TCRs against it.
A class I T cell "epitope" requires a short peptide that is bound to a class I MHC receptor,
forming a ternary complex (MHC class I alpha chain, beta-2-microglobulin, and peptide) that
can be recognized by a T cell bearing a matching T-cell receptor binding to the MHC/peptide
complex with appropriate affinity. Peptides binding to MHC class I molecules are typically 8
14 amino acids in length, and most typically 9 amino acids in length.
In humans there are three different genetic loci that encode MHC class I molecules (the
MHC-molecules of the human are also designated human leukocyte antigens (HLA)): HLA
A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. HLA-A*01, HLA-A*02, and HLA-B*07 are examples of different
MHC class I alleles that can be expressed from these loci.
Table 2: Expression frequencies F of HLA*A02 and the most frequent HLA-DR serotypes.
Frequencies are deduced from haplotype frequencies Gf within the American population
adapted from Mori et al. (Mori et al., 1997) employing the Hardy-Weinberg formula F=1-(1
Gf) 2 . Combinations of A*02 with certain HLA-DR alleles might be enriched or less frequent
than expected from their single frequencies due to linkage disequilibrium. For details refer to

Therefore, for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes a peptide that binds with appropriate af
finity to several different HLA class II receptors is highly desirable. A peptide binding to sev
eral different HLA class II molecules is called a promiscuous binder.
As used herein, reference to a DNA sequence includes both single stranded and double
stranded DNA. Thus, the specific sequence, unless the context indicates otherwise, refers to
the single strand DNA of such sequence, the duplex of such sequence with its complement
(double stranded DNA) and the complement of such sequence. The term "coding region" re
fers to that portion of a gene which either naturally or normally codes for the expression
product of that gene in its natural genomic environment, i.e., the region coding in vivo for the
native expression product of the gene.
The coding region can be from a non-mutated ("normal"), mutated or altered gene, or can
even be from a DNA sequence, or gene, wholly synthesized in the laboratory using methods
well known to those of skill in the art of DNA synthesis.
The term "nucleotide sequence" refers to a heteropolymer of deoxyribonucleotides.
The nucleotide sequence coding for a particular peptide, oligopeptide, or polypeptide may be
naturally occurring or they may be synthetically constructed. Generally, DNA segments en
coding the peptides, polypeptides, and proteins of this invention are assembled from cDNA
fragments and short oligonucleotide linkers, or from a series of oligonucleotides, to provide a
synthetic gene that is capable of being expressed in a recombinant transcriptional unit com
prising regulatory elements derived from a microbial or viral operon.
As used herein the term "a nucleotide coding (or encoding) for a peptide" refers to a nucleo
tide sequence coding for the peptide including artificial (man-made) start and stop codons
compatible for the biological system the sequence is going to be expressed by.
The term "expression product" means the polypeptide or protein that is the natural translation
product of the gene and any nucleic acid sequence coding equivalents resulting from genetic
code degeneracy and thus coding for the same amino acid(s).
The term "fragment", when referring to a coding sequence, means a portion of DNA compris
ing less than the complete coding region, whose expression product retains essentially the
same biological function or activity as the expression product of the complete coding region.
The term "DNA segment" refers to a DNA polymer, in the form of a separate fragment or as a
component of a larger DNA construct, which has been derived from DNA isolated at least
once in substantially pure form, i.e., free of contaminating endogenous materials and in a
quantity or concentration enabling identification, manipulation, and recovery of the segment
and its component nucleotide sequences by standard biochemical methods, for example, by
using a cloning vector. Such segments are provided in the form of an open reading frame un
interrupted by internal non-translated sequences, or introns, which are typically present in

  WO 2015/018805                                                              PCT/EP2014/066755
                                               - 37
eukaryotic genes. Sequences of non-translated DNA may be present downstream from the
open reading frame, where the same do not interfere with manipulation or expression of the
coding regions.
The term "primer" means a short nucleic acid sequence that can be paired with one strand of
DNA and provides a free 3'-OH end at which a DNA polymerase starts synthesis of a deoxy
ribonucleotide chain.
The term "promoter" means a region of DNA involved in binding of RNA polymerase to ini
tiate transcription.
The term "isolated" means that the material is removed from its original environment (e.g.,
the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally-occurring poly
nucleotide or polypeptide present in a living animal is not isolated, but the same polynucleo
tide or polypeptide, separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural sys
tem, is isolated. Such polynucleotides could be part of a vector and/or such polynucleotides or
polypeptides could be part of a composition, and still be isolated in that such vector or com
position is not part of its natural environment.
The polynucleotides, and recombinant or immunogenic polypeptides, disclosed in accordance
with the present invention may also be in "purified" form. The term "purified" does not re
quire absolute purity; rather, it is intended as a relative definition, and can include prepara
tions that are highly purified or preparations that are only partially purified, as those terms are
understood by those of skill in the relevant art. For example, individual clones isolated from a
cDNA library have been conventionally purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Purification
of starting material or natural material to at least one order of magnitude, preferably two or
three orders, and more preferably four or five orders of magnitude is expressly contemplated.
Furthermore, a claimed polypeptide which has a purity of preferably 99.999%, or at least
99.99% or 99.9%; and even desirably 99% by weight or greater is expressly contemplated.
The nucleic acids and polypeptide expression products disclosed according to the present in
vention, as well as expression vectors containing such nucleic acids and/or such polypeptides,
may be in "enriched form". As used herein, the term "enriched" means that the concentration
of the material is at least about 2, 5, 10, 100, or 1000 times its natural concentration (for ex
ample), advantageously 0.01 %, by weight, preferably at least about 0.1% by weight. En
riched preparations of about 0.5%, 1%, 5%, 10%, and 2 0% by weight are also contemplated.
The sequences, constructs, vectors, clones, and other materials comprising the present inven
tion can advantageously be in enriched or isolated form.
The term "active fragment" means a fragment that generates an immune response (i.e., has
immunogenic activity) when administered, alone or optionally with a suitable adjuvant, to an
animal, such as a mammal, for example, a rabbit or a mouse, and also including a human,
such immune response taking the form of stimulating a T-cell response within the recipient
animal, such as a human. Alternatively, the "active fragment" may also be used to induce a T
cell response in vitro.
As used herein, the terms "portion", "segment" and "fragment," when used in relation to pol
ypeptides, refer to a continuous sequence of residues, such as amino acid residues, which se
quence forms a subset of a larger sequence. For example, if a polypeptide were subjected to
treatment with any of the common endopeptidases, such as trypsin or chymotrypsin, the oli
gopeptides resulting from such treatment would represent portions, segments or fragments of

  WO 2015/018805                                                              PCT/EP2014/066755
                                                 - 38
the starting polypeptide. When used in relation to polynucleotides, these terms refer to the
products produced by treatment of said polynucleotides with any of the endonucleases.
In accordance with the present invention, the term "percent identity" or "percent identical",
when referring to a sequence, means that a sequence is compared to a claimed or described
sequence after alignment of the sequence to be compared (the "Compared Sequence") with
the described or claimed sequence (the "Reference Sequence"). The Percent Identity is then
determined according to the following formula:
Percent Identity = 100 [1 -(C/R)]
wherein C is the number of differences between the Reference Sequence and the Compared
Sequence over the length of alignment between the Reference Sequence and the Compared
Sequence, wherein
(i) each base or amino acid in the Reference Sequence that does not have a corresponding
aligned base or amino acid in the Compared Sequence and
(ii) each gap in the Reference Sequence and
(iii) each aligned base or amino acid in the Reference Sequence that is different from an
aligned base or amino acid in the Compared Sequence, constitutes a difference and
(iiii) the alignment has to start at position 1 of the aligned sequences;
and R is the number of bases or amino acids in the Reference Sequence over the length of the
alignment with the Compared Sequence with any gap created in the Reference Sequence also
being counted as a base or amino acid.
If an alignment exists between the Compared Sequence and the Reference Sequence for
which the Percent Identity as calculated above is about equal to or greater than a specified
minimum Percent Identity then the Compared Sequence has the specified minimum Percent
Identity to the Reference Sequence even though alignments may exist in which the herein
above calculated Percent Identity is less than the specified Percent Identity.
The original (unmodified) peptides as disclosed herein can be modified by the substitution of
one or more residues at different, possibly selective, sites within the peptide chain, if not oth
erwise stated.
Preferably those substitutions are located at the end of the amino acid chain. Such substitu
tions may be of a conservative nature, for example, where one amino acid is replaced by an
amino acid of similar structure and characteristics, such as where a hydrophobic amino acid is
replaced by another hydrophobic amino acid. Even more conservative would be replacement
of amino acids of the same or similar size and chemical nature, such as where leucine is re
placed by isoleucine. In studies of sequence variations in families of naturally occurring ho
mologous proteins, certain amino acid substitutions are more often tolerated than others, and
these are often show correlation with similarities in size, charge, polarity, and hydrophobicity
between the original amino acid and its replacement, and such is the basis for defining "con
servative substitutions."
Conservative substitutions are herein defined as exchanges within one of the following five
groups: Group 1-small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar residues (Ala, Ser, Thr, Pro, Gly);
Group 2-polar, negatively charged residues and their amides (Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln); Group 3
polar, positively charged residues (His, Arg, Lys); Group 4-large, aliphatic, nonpolar residues
(Met, Leu, Ile, Val, Cys); and Group 5-large, aromatic residues (Phe, Tyr, Trp).

                                               - 39
Less conservative substitutions might involve the replacement of one amino acid by another
that has similar characteristics but is somewhat different in size, such as replacement of an
alanine by an isoleucine residue. Highly non-conservative replacements might involve substi
tuting an acidic amino acid for one that is polar, or even for one that is basic in character.
Such "radical" substitutions cannot, however, be dismissed as potentially ineffective since
chemical effects are not totally predictable and radical substitutions might well give rise to
serendipitous effects not otherwise predictable from simple chemical principles.
Of course, such substitutions may involve structures other than the common L-amino acids.
Thus, D-amino acids might be substituted for the L-amino acids commonly found in the anti
genic peptides of the invention and yet still be encompassed by the disclosure herein. In addi
tion, amino acids possessing non-standard R groups (i.e., R groups other than those found in
the common 20 amino acids of natural proteins) may also be used for substitution purposes to
produce immunogens and immunogenic polypeptides according to the present invention.
If substitutions at more than one position are found to result in a peptide with substantially
equivalent or greater antigenic activity as defined below, then combinations of those substitu
tions will be tested to determine if the combined substitutions result in additive or synergistic
effects on the antigenicity of the peptide. At most, no more than 4 positions within the peptide
would simultaneously be substituted.
The peptides of the invention can be elongated by up to four amino acids, that is 1, 2, 3 or 4
amino acids can be added to either end in any combination between 4:0 and 0:4.
Combinations of the elongations according to the invention can be depicted from table 3:

The amino acids for the elongation can be the peptides of the original sequence of the protein
or any other amino acid. The elongation can be used to enhance the stability or solubility of
the peptides.
The term "T-cell response" means the specific proliferation and activation of effector func
tions induced by a peptide in vitro or in vivo. For MHC class I restricted CTLs, effector func
tions may be lysis of peptide-pulsed, peptide-precursor pulsed or naturally peptide-presenting
target cells, secretion of cytokines, preferably Interferon-gamma, TNF-alpha, or IL-2 induced
by peptide, secretion of effector molecules, preferably granzymes or perforins induced by
peptide, or degranulation.
Preferably, when the CTLs specific for a peptide of SEQ ID No. 1 to SEQ ID No. 92 are test
ed against the substituted peptides, the peptide concentration at which the substituted peptides

achieve half the maximal increase in lysis relative to background is no more than about 1
mM, preferably no more than about 1 pM, more preferably no more than about 1 nM, and still
more preferably no more than about 100 pM, and most preferably no more than about 10 pM.
It is also preferred that the substituted peptide be recognized by CTLs from more than one
individual, at least two, and more preferably three individuals.
Thus, the epitopes of the present invention may be identical to naturally occurring tumor
associated or tumor-specific epitopes or may include epitopes that differ by no more than 4
residues from the reference peptide, as long as they have substantially identical antigenic ac
tivity.
Stimulation of an immune response is dependent upon the presence of antigens recognized as
foreign by the host immune system. The discovery of the existence of tumor associated anti
gens has now raised the possibility of using a host's immune system to intervene in tumor
growth. Various mechanisms of harnessing both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune
system are currently explored for cancer immunotherapy.
Specific elements of the cellular immune response are capable of specifically recognizing and
destroying tumor cells. The isolation of cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) from tumor-infiltrating cell
populations or from peripheral blood suggests that such cells play an important role in natural
immune defences against cancer. CD8-positive T-cells in particular, which recognize class I
molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-bearing peptides of usually 8 to 12
residues derived from proteins or defect ribosomal products (DRIPS) located in the cytosols,
play an important role in this response. The MHC-molecules of the human are also designated
as human leukocyte-antigens (HLA).
MHC class I molecules can be found on most cells having a nucleus which present peptides
that result from proteolytic cleavage of mainly endogenous, cytosolic or nuclear proteins,
DRIPS, and larger peptides. However, peptides derived from endosomal compartments or
exogenous sources are also frequently found on MHC class I molecules. This non-classical
way of class I presentation is referred to as cross-presentation in literature.
Since both types of response, CD8 and CD4 dependent, contribute jointly and synergistically
to the anti-tumor effect, the identification and characterization of tumor-associated antigens
recognized by either CD8-positive CTLs (MHC class I molecule) or by CD4-positive CTLs
(MHC class II molecule) is important in the development of tumor vaccines. It is therefore an
object of the present invention, to provide compositions of peptides that contain peptides
binding to MHC complexes of either class.
Considering the severe side-effects and expense associated with treating cancer better progno
sis and diagnostic methods are desperately needed. Therefore, there is a need to identify other
factors representing biomarkers for cancer in general and lung cancer in particular. Further
more, there is a need to identify factors that can be used in the treatment of cancer in general
and lung cancer in particular.
The present invention provides peptides that are useful in treating cancers / tumors, preferably
lung cancers, even more preferably non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) that over- or
exclusively present the peptides of the invention. These peptides were shown by mass spec
trometry to be naturally presented by HLA molecules on primary human lung cancer samples
(see example 1, and figure 1).

  WO 2015/018805                                                                PCT/EP2014/066755
                                                  - 41
The source gene/protein (also designated "full-length protein" or "underlying protein") from
which the peptides are derived were shown to be highly overexpressed in non-small cell lung
carcinoma, and for SEQ IDs No. 66 to 75 gastric cancer and glioblastoma compared with
normal tissues (see example 2, and figure 2 for NSCLC) demonstrating a high degree of tu
mor association of the source genes. Moreover, the peptides themselves are strongly over
presented on tumor tissue but not on normal tissues (see example 3 and Figure 3).
HLA-bound peptides can be recognized by the immune system, specifically T lymphocytes/T
cells. T cells can destroy the cells presenting the recognized HLA/peptide complex, e.g. lung
cancer cells presenting the derived peptides.
The peptides of the present invention have been shown to be capable of stimulating T cell
responses and / or are over-presented and thus can be used for the production of antibodies
and / or TCRs, in particular sTCRs, according to the present invention (see example 4 and
figure 4). Furthermore, the peptides when complexed with the respective MHC can be used
for the production of antibodies and / or TCRs, in particular sTCRs, according to the present
invention, as well. Respective methods are well known to the person of skill, and can be
found in the respective literature as well. Thus, the peptides of the present invention are useful
for generating an immune response in a patient by which tumor cells can be destroyed. An
immune response in a patient can be induced by direct administration of the described pep
tides or suitable precursor substances (e.g. elongated peptides, proteins, or nucleic acids en
coding these peptides) to the patient, ideally in combination with an agent enhancing the im
munogenicity (i.e. an adjuvant). The immune response originating from such a therapeutic
vaccination can be expected to be highly specific against tumor cells because the target pep
tides of the present invention are not presented on normal tissues in comparable copy num
bers, preventing the risk of undesired autoimmune reactions against normal cells in the pa
tient.
The pharmaceutical compositions comprise the peptides either in the free form or in the form
of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. As used herein, "a pharmaceutically acceptable salt"
refers to a derivative of the disclosed peptides wherein the peptide is modified by making acid
or base salts of the agent. For example, acid salts are prepared from the free base (typically
wherein the neutral form of the drug has a neutral -NH 2 group) involving reaction with a suit
able acid. Suitable acids for preparing acid salts include both organic acids, e.g., acetic acid,
propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic ac
id, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic
acid, methane sulfonic acid, ethane sulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and
the like, as well as inorganic acids, e.g., hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid,
nitric acid phosphoric acid and the like. Conversely, preparation of basic salts of acid moieties
which may be present on a peptide are prepared using a pharmaceutically acceptable base
such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide,
trimethylamine or the like.
In an especially preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions comprise the pep
tides as salts of acetic acid (acetates), trifluoro acetates or hydrochloric acid (chlorides).
In addition to being useful for treating cancer, the peptides of the present invention are also
useful as diagnostics. Since the peptides were generated from lung cancer cells and since it
was determined that these peptides are not or at lower levels present in normal tissues, these
peptides can be used to diagnose the presence of a cancer.

  WO 2015/018805                                                              PCT/EP2014/066755

The presence of claimed peptides on tissue biopsies can assist a pathologist in diagnosis of
cancer. Detection of certain peptides by means of antibodies, mass spectrometry or other
methods known in the art can tell the pathologist that the tissue is malignant or inflamed or
generally diseased. Presence of groups of peptides can enable classification or sub
classification of diseased tissues.
The detection of peptides on diseased tissue specimen can enable the decision about the bene
fit of therapies involving the immune system, especially if T-lymphocytes are known or ex
pected to be involved in the mechanism of action. Loss of MHC expression is a well de
scribed mechanism by which infected of malignant cells escape immuno-surveillance. Thus,
presence of peptides shows that this mechanism is not exploited by the analyzed cells.
The peptides of the present invention might be used to analyze lymphocyte responses against
those peptides such as T cell responses or antibody responses against the peptide or the pep
tide complexed to MHC molecules. These lymphocyte responses can be used as prognostic
markers for decision on further therapy steps. These responses can also be used as surrogate
markers in immunotherapy approaches aiming to induce lymphocyte responses by different
means, e.g. vaccination of protein, nucleic acids, autologous materials, adoptive transfer of
lymphocytes. In gene therapy settings, lymphocyte responses against peptides can be consid
ered in the assessment of side effects. Monitoring of lymphocyte responses might also be a
valuable tool for follow-up examinations of transplantation therapies, e.g. for the detection of
graft versus host and host versus graft diseases.
The peptides of the present invention can be used to generate and develop specific antibodies
against MHC/peptide complexes. These can be used for therapy, targeting toxins or radioac
tive substances to the diseased tissue. Another use of these antibodies can be targeting radio
nuclides to the diseased tissue for imaging purposes such as PET. This use can help to detect
small metastases or to determine the size and precise localization of diseased tissues.
Therefore it is a further aspect of the invention to provide a method for producing a recombi
nant antibody specifically binding to a human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
I or II being complexed with a HLA-restricted antigen, the method comprising: immunizing a
genetically engineered non-human mammal comprising cells expressing said human major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II with a soluble form of a MHC class I or II
molecule being complexed with said HLA-restricted antigen; isolating mRNA molecules
from antibody producing cells of said non-human mammal; producing a phage display library
displaying protein molecules encoded by said mRNA molecules; and isolating at least one
phage from said phage display library, said at least one phage displaying said antibody specif
ically binding to said human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II being
complexed with said HLA-restricted antigen.
It is a further aspect of the invention to provide an antibody that specifically binds to a human
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II being complexed with a HLA-restricted
antigen, wherein the antibody preferably is a polyclonal antibody, monoclonal antibody, bi

Yet another aspect of the present invention then relates to a method of producing said anti
body specifically binding to a human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II

from said phage display library, said at least one phage displaying said antibody specifically
bindable to said human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II being com
plexed with said HLA-restricted antigen. Respective methods for producing such antibodies
and single chain class I major histocompatibility complexes, as well as other tools for the pro
duction of these antibodies are disclosed in WO 03/068201, WO 2004/084798, WO

vention are all explicitly incorporated by reference in their entireties.
Preferably, the antibody is binding with a binding affinity of below 20 nanomolar, preferably
of below 10 nanomolar, to the complex, which is regarded as "specific" in the context of the
present invention.
It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a method for producing a soluble T-cell recep
tor recognizing a specific peptide-MHC complex. Such soluble T-cell receptors can be gener
ated from specific T-cell clones, and their affinity can be increased by mutagenesis targeting
the complementarity-determining regions. For the purpose of T-cell receptor selection, phage
display can be used (US 2010/0113300, Liddy N, Bossi G, Adams KJ, Lissina A, Mahon TM,
Hassan NJ, et al. Monoclonal TCR-redirected tumor cell killing. Nat Med 2012
Jun; 18(6):980-987). For the purpose of stabilization of T-cell receptors during phage display
and in case of practical use as drug, alpha and beta chain can be linked e.g. by non-native di
sulfide bonds, other covalent bonds (single-chain T-cell receptor), or by dimerization domains
(see Boulter JM, Glick M, Todorov PT, Baston E, Sami M, Rizkallah P, et al. Stable, soluble

soluble alphabeta T-cell receptor heterodimers suitable for biophysical analysis of ligand
binding. Protein Sci 1999 Nov; 8 (11):2418-2423). The T-cell receptor can be linked to tox
ins, drugs, cytokines (see US 2013/0115191), domains recruiting effector cells such as an
anti-CD3 domain, etc., in order to execute particular functions on target cells. Moreover, it
could be expressed in T cells used for adoptive transfer.
Further information can be found in WO 2004/033685A1 and WO 2004/074322A1. A com
bination of sTCRs is described in WO 2012/056407A1. Further methods for the production
are disclosed in WO 2013/057586A1.
In addition, they can be used to verify a pathologist's diagnosis of a cancer based on a biop
sied sample.

To select over-presented peptides, a presentation profile is calculated showing the median
sample presentation as well as replicate variation. The profile juxtaposes samples of the tumor
entity of interest to a baseline of normal tissue samples. Each of these profiles can then be
consolidated into an over-presentation score by calculating the p-value of a Linear Mixed
Effects Model (J. Pinheiro, D. Bates, S. DebRoy, Sarkar D., R Core team. nlme: Linear and
Nonlinear Mixed Effects Models. 2008) adjusting for multiple testing by False Discovery
Rate (Y. Benjamini and Y. Hochberg. Controlling the False Discovery Rate: A Practical and
Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B
(Methodological), Vol.57 (No. 1):289-300, 1995).
For the identification and relative quantitation of HLA ligands by mass spectrometry, HLA
molecules from shock-frozen tissue samples were purified and HLA-associated peptides were
isolated. The isolated peptides were separated and sequences were identified by online nano
electrospray-ionization (nanoESI) liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) exper
iments. The resulting peptide sequences were verified by comparison of the fragmentation
pattern of natural TUMAPs recorded from NSCLC samples with the fragmentation patterns of
corresponding synthetic reference peptides of identical sequences. Since the peptides were
directly identified as ligands of HLA molecules of primary tumors, these results provide di
rect evidence for the natural processing and presentation of the identified peptides on primary
tumor tissue obtained from NSCLC patients.
The proprietary discovery pipeline XPRESIDENT@ v2.1 (see, for example, US 2013
0096016which is hereby incorporated in its entirety) allows the identification and selection of
relevant over-presented peptide vaccine candidates based on direct relative quantitation of
HLA-restricted peptide levels on cancer tissues in comparison to several different non
cancerous tissues and organs. This was achieved by the development of label-free differential
quantitation using the acquired LC-MS data processed by a proprietary data analysis pipeline,
combining algorithms for sequence identification, spectral clustering, ion counting, retention
time alignment, charge state deconvolution and normalization.
Presentation levels including error estimates for each peptide and sample were established.
Peptides exclusively presented on tumor tissue and peptides over-presented in tumor versus
non-cancerous tissues and organs have been identified.
HLA-peptide complexes from 50 shock-frozen NSCLC tumor tissue samples were purified
and HLA-associated peptides were isolated and analysed by LC-MS.
All TUMAPs contained in the application at hand were identified with this approach on pri
mary NSCLC tumor samples confirming their presentation on primary NSCLC.
TUMAPs identified on multiple NSCLC tumor and normal tissues were quantified using ion
counting of label-free LC-MS data. The method assumes that LC-MS signal areas of a peptide
correlate with its abundance in the sample. All quantitative signals of a peptide in various LC
MS experiments were normalized based on central tendency, averaged per sample and merged
into a bar plot, called presentation profile. The presentation profile consolidates different
analysis methods like protein database search, spectral clustering, charge state deconvolution
(decharging) and retention time alignment and normalization.

The term "antibody" or "antibodies" is used herein in a broad sense and includes both poly
clonal and monoclonal antibodies. In addition to intact or "full" immunoglobulin molecules,
also included in the term "antibodies" are fragments or polymers of those immunoglobulin

  WO 2015/018805                                                            PCT/EP2014/066755
                                                - 47
molecules and humanized versions of immunoglobulin molecules, so long as they exhibit any
of the desired properties (e.g., specific binding of an lung cancer marker polypeptide, delivery
of a toxin to an lung cancer cell expressing a lung cancer marker gene at an increased level,
and/or inhibiting the activity of a lung cancer marker polypeptide) according to the invention.
Whenever possible, the antibodies of the invention may be purchased from commercial
sources. The antibodies of the invention may also be generated using well-known methods.
The skilled artisan will understand that either full length lung cancer marker polypeptides or
fragments thereof may be used to generate the antibodies of the invention. A polypeptide to
be used for generating an antibody of the invention may be partially or fully purified from a
natural source, or may be produced using recombinant DNA techniques.
For example, a cDNA encoding a ABCA13, MMP12, DST, MXRA5, CDK4, HNRNPH,
TANC2, 1RNF213, SMYD3 and SLC34A2, or any other polypeptide of SEQ ID No. 1 to
SEQ ID No. 65, and SEQ ID No. 76 to SEQ ID No. 84 and SEQ ID No. 92 polypeptide, or a
fragment thereof, can be expressed in prokaryotic cells (e.g., bacteria) or eukaryotic cells
(e.g., yeast, insect, or mammalian cells), after which the recombinant protein can be purified
and used to generate a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody preparation that specifically bind
the lung cancer marker polypeptide used to generate the antibody according to the invention.
One of skill in the art will realize that the generation of two or more different sets of mono
clonal or polyclonal antibodies maximizes the likelihood of obtaining an antibody with the
specificity and affinity required for its intended use (e.g., ELISA, immunohistochemistry, in
vivo imaging, immunotoxin therapy). The antibodies are tested for their desired activity by
known methods, in accordance with the purpose for which the antibodies are to be used (e.g.,
ELISA, immunohistochemistry, immunotherapy, etc.; for further guidance on the generation
and testing of antibodies, see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1988, new 2 "dedition 2013). For
example, the antibodies may be tested in ELISA assays, Western blots, immunohistochemical
staining of formalin-fixed lung cancers or frozen tissue sections. After their initial in vitro
characterization, antibodies intended for therapeutic or in vivo diagnostic use are tested ac
cording to known clinical testing methods.
The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a substan
tially homogeneous population of antibodies, i.e.; the individual antibodies comprising the
population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present
in minor amounts. The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibod
ies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to cor
responding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a partic
ular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homol
ogous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to
another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they
exhibit the desired antagonistic activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567, which is hereby incorpo
rated by reference in its entirety).
Monoclonal antibodies of the invention may be prepared using hybridoma methods. In a hy
bridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal is typically immunized with an
immunizing agent to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies
that will specifically bind to the immunizing agent. Alternatively, the lymphocytes may be
immunized in vitro.

  WO 2015/018805                                                                PCT/EP2014/066755
                                                - 48
The monoclonal antibodies may also be made by recombinant DNA methods, such as those
described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies of the inven
tion can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oli
gonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and
light chains of murine antibodies).
In vitro methods are also suitable for preparing monovalent antibodies. Digestion of antibod
ies to produce fragments thereof, particularly, Fab fragments, can be accomplished using rou
tine techniques known in the art. For instance, digestion can be performed using papain. Ex
amples of papain digestion are described in WO 94/29348 published Dec. 22, 1994 and U.S.
Pat. No. 4,342,566. Papain digestion of antibodies typically produces two identical antigen
binding fragments, called Fab fragments, each with a single antigen binding site, and a resid
ual Fe fragment. Pepsin treatment yields a fragment that has two antigen combining sites and
is still capable of cross-linking antigen.
The antibody fragments, whether attached to other sequences or not, can also include inser
tions, deletions, substitutions, or other selected modifications of particular regions or specific
amino acids residues, provided the activity of the fragment is not significantly altered or im
paired compared to the non-modified antibody or antibody fragment. These modifications can
provide for some additional property, such as to remove/add amino acids capable of disulfide
bonding, to increase its bio-longevity, to alter its secretory characteristics, etc. In any case, the
antibody fragment must possess a bioactive property, such as binding activity, regulation of
binding at the binding domain, etc. Functional or active regions of the antibody may be identi
fied by mutagenesis of a specific region of the protein, followed by expression and testing of
the expressed polypeptide. Such methods are readily apparent to a skilled practitioner in the
art and can include site-specific mutagenesis of the nucleic acid encoding the antibody frag
ment.
The antibodies of the invention may further comprise humanized antibodies or human anti
bodies. Humanized forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric immunoglobu
lins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab' or other antigen
binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non
human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins (recipient
antibody) in which residues from a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient
are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as
mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, Fv
framework (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non
human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither
in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the
humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable
domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non
human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human
immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise
at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immu
noglobulin.
Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally, a hu
manized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which
is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as "import" resi
dues, which are typically taken from an "import" variable domain. Humanization can be es
sentially performed by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding

  WO 2015/018805                                                              PCT/EP2014/066755
                                               - 49
sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such "humanized" antibodies are chimeric anti
bodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable
domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In
practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues
and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent an
tibodies.
Transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full rep
ertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production can be
employed. For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody
heavy chain joining region gene in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete
inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ-line immuno
globulin gene array in such germ-line mutant mice will result in the production of human an
tibodies upon antigen challenge. Human antibodies can also be produced in phage display
libraries.
Antibodies of the invention are preferably administered to a subject in a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier. Typically, an appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt is
used in the formulation to render the formulation isotonic. Examples of the pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier include saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. The pH of the solu
tion is preferably from about 5 to about 8, and more preferably from about 7 to about 7.5. Fur
ther carriers include sustained release preparations such as semipermeable matrices of solid
hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped arti
cles, e.g., films, liposomes or microparticles. It will be apparent to those persons skilled in the
art that certain carriers may be more preferable depending upon, for instance, the route of ad
ministration and concentration of antibody being administered.
The antibodies can be administered to the subject, patient, or cell by injection (e.g., intrave
nous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular), or by other methods such as infusion that
ensure its delivery to the bloodstream in an effective form. The antibodies may also be admin
istered by intratumoral or peritumoral routes, to exert local as well as systemic therapeutic
effects. Local or intravenous injection is preferred.
Effective dosages and schedules for administering the antibodies may be determined empiri
cally, and making such determinations is within the skill in the art. Those skilled in the art
will understand that the dosage of antibodies that must be administered will vary depending
on, for example, the subject that will receive the antibody, the route of administration, the
particular type of antibody used and other drugs being administered. A typical daily dosage of
the antibody used alone might range from about 1 (pg/kg to up to 100 mg/kg of body weight
or more per day, depending on the factors mentioned above. Following administration of an
antibody for treating lung cancer, the efficacy of the therapeutic antibody can be assessed in
various ways well known to the skilled practitioner. For instance, the size, number, and/or
distribution of lung cancer in a subject receiving treatment may be monitored using standard
tumor imaging techniques. A therapeutically-administered antibody that arrests tumor growth,
results in tumor shrinkage, and/or prevents the development of new tumors, compared to the
disease course that would occurs in the absence of antibody administration, is an efficacious
antibody for treatment of lung cancer.
Because the lung tumor markers ABCA13, MMP12 of the invention are highly expressed in
lung cancer cells and are expressed at extremely low levels in normal cells, inhibition of

  WO 2015/018805                                                               PCT/EP2014/066755
                                                - 50
ABCA13 and MMP12 expression or polypeptide activity may be integrated into any thera
peutic strategy for treating or preventing NSCLC.
The principle of antisense therapy is based on the hypothesis that sequence-specific suppres
 sion of gene expression (via transcription or translation) may be achieved by intra-cellular
hybridization between genomic DNA or mRNA and a complementary antisense species. The
 formation of such a hybrid nucleic acid duplex interferes with transcription of the target tumor
 antigen-encoding genomic DNA, or processing/transport/translation and/or stability of the
target tumor antigen mRNA.
Antisense nucleic acids can be delivered by a variety of approaches. For example, antisense
oligonucleotides or anti-sense RNA can be directly administered (e.g., by intravenous injec
tion) to a subject in a form that allows uptake into tumor cells. Alternatively, viral or plasmid
vectors that encode antisense RNA (or RNA fragments) can be introduced into cells in vivo.
Antisense effects can also be induced by sense sequences; however, the extent of phenotypic
 changes is highly variable. Phenotypic changes induced by effective antisense therapy are
 assessed according to changes in, e.g., target mRNA levels, target protein levels, and/or target
protein activity levels.
In a specific example, inhibition of lung tumor marker function by antisense gene therapy
may be accomplished by direct administration of antisense lung tumor marker RNA to a sub
ject. The antisense tumor marker RNA may be produced and isolated by any standard tech
nique, but is most readily produced by in vitro transcription using an antisense tumor marker
 cDNA under the control of a high efficiency promoter (e.g., the T7 promoter). Administration
of anti-sense tumor marker RNA to cells can be carried out by any of the methods for direct
nucleic acid administration described below.
An alternative strategy for inhibiting ABCA13, and MMP12 function using gene therapy in
volves intracellular expression of an anti-ABCA13, MMP12 antibody or a portion of an anti
ABCA13, MMP12 antibody. For example, the gene (or gene fragment) encoding a monoclo
nal antibody that specifically binds to an ABCA13, MMP12 polypeptide and inhibits its bio
 logical activity is placed under the transcriptional control of a specific (e.g., tissue- or tumor
 specific) gene regulatory sequence, within a nucleic acid expression vector. The vector is then
 administered to the subject such that it is taken up by lung cancer cells or other cells, which
then secrete the anti-ABCA13, MMP12 antibody and thereby block biological activity of the
ABCA13, MMP12 polypeptide. Preferably, the ABCA13, MMP12polypeptides are present at
the extracellular surface of gastric cancer cells.
In the methods described above, which include the administration and uptake of exogenous
DNA into the cells of a subject (i.e., gene transduction or transfection), the nucleic acids of
the present invention can be in the form of naked DNA or the nucleic acids can be in a vector
 for delivering the nucleic acids to the cells for inhibition of gastric tumor marker protein ex
pression. The vector can be a commercially available preparation, such as an adenovirus vec
tor (Quantum Biotechnologies, Inc. (Laval, Quebec, Canada). Delivery of the nucleic acid or
vector to cells can be via a variety of mechanisms. As one example, delivery can be via a lip
osome, using commercially available liposome preparations such as LIPOFECTIN,
LIPOFECTAMINE (GIBCO-25 BRL, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.), SUPERFECT (Qiagen, Inc.
Hilden, Germany) and TRANSFECTAM (Promega Biotec, Inc., Madison, Wis.), as well as
other liposomes developed according to procedures standard in the art. In addition, the nucleic
 acid or vector of this invention can be delivered in vivo by electroporation, the technology for

  WO 2015/018805                                                             PCT/EP2014/066755
                                               - 51
which is available from Genetronics, Inc. (San Diego, Calif.) as well as by means of a
SONOPORATION machine (ImaRx Pharmaceutical Corp., Tucson, Arizona).
As one example, vector delivery can be via a viral system, such as a retroviral vector system
that can package a recombinant retroviral genome. The recombinant retrovirus can then be
used to infect and thereby deliver to the infected cells antisense nucleic acid that inhibits ex
pression of ABCA13, MMP12. The exact method of introducing the altered nucleic acid into
mammalian cells is, of course, not limited to the use of retroviral vectors. Other techniques
are widely available for this procedure including the use of adenoviral vectors, adeno
associated viral (AAV) vectors, lentiviral vectors, pseudotyped retroviral vectors. Physical
transduction techniques can also be used, such as liposome delivery and receptor-mediated
and other endocytosis mechanisms. This invention can be used in conjunction with any of
these or other commonly used gene transfer methods.
The antibodies may also be used for in vivo diagnostic assays. Generally, the antibody is la
beled with a radionucleotide (such as "'In, 99Te, "C,       , 3H, 32 P or 35 S) so that the tumor
can be localized using immunoscintiography. In one embodiment, antibodies or fragments
thereof bind to the extracellular domains of two or more ABCA13, MMP12 targets and the
affinity value (Kd) is less than 1 x 10pM.
Antibodies for diagnostic use may be labeled with probes suitable for detection by various
imaging methods. Methods for detection of probes include, but are not limited to, fluores
cence, light, confocal and electron microscopy; magnetic resonance imaging and spectrosco
py; fluoroscopy, computed tomography and positron emission tomography. Suitable probes
include, but are not limited to, fluorescein, rhodamine, eosin and other fluorophores, radioiso
topes, gold, gadolinium and other lanthanides, paramagnetic iron, fluorine-18 and other posi
tron-emitting radionuclides. Additionally, probes may be bi- or multi-functional and be de
tectable by more than one of the methods listed. These antibodies may be directly or indirect
ly labeled with said probes. Attachment of probes to the antibodies includes covalent attach
ment of the probe, incorporation of the probe into the antibody, and the covalent attachment
of a chelating compound for binding of probe, amongst others well recognized in the art. For
immunohistochemistry, the disease tissue sample may be fresh or frozen or may be embedded
in paraffin and fixed with a preservative such as formalin. The fixed or embedded section
contains the sample are contacted with a labeled primary antibody and secondary antibody,
wherein the antibody is used to detect the ABCA13, MMP12 proteins express in situ.
The present invention thus provides a peptide comprising a sequence that is selected from the
group of consisting of SEQ ID No. I to SEQ ID No. 65, and SEQ ID No. 76 to SEQ ID No.
84, and SEQ ID No. 92 or a variant thereof which is 90% homologous to SEQ ID No. 1 to
SEQ ID No. 65, and SEQ ID No. 76 to SEQ ID No. 84, and SEQ ID No. 92 or a variant
thereof that will induce T cells cross-reacting with said peptide.
The peptides of the invention have the ability to bind to a molecule of the human major histo
compatibility complex (MHC) class-I and / or class II.
In the present invention, the term "homologous" refers to the degree of identity (see Percent
Identity above) between sequences of two amino acid sequences, i.e. peptide or polypeptide
sequences. The aforementioned "homology" is determined by comparing two sequences
aligned under optimal conditions over the sequences to be compared. Such a sequence ho
mology can be calculated by creating an alignment using, for example, the ClustalW algo-

  WO 2015/018805                                                               PCT/EP2014/066755
                                                -52
rithm. Commonly available sequence analysis software, more specifically, Vector NTI,
GENETYX or other analysis tools are provided by public databases.
A person skilled in the art will be able to assess, whether T cells induced by a variant of a
specific peptide will be able to cross-react with the peptide itself (Fong et al., 2001);
(Zaremba et al., 1997; Colombetti et al., 2006; Appay et al., 2006).
By a "variant" of the given amino acid sequence the inventors mean that the side chains of,
for example, one or two of the amino acid residues are altered (for example by replacing them
with the side chain of another naturally occurring amino acid residue or some other side
chain) such that the peptide is still able to bind to an HLA molecule in substantially the same
way as a peptide consisting of the given amino acid sequence in consisting of SEQ ID No. 1
to SEQ ID No. 65, and SEQ ID No. 76 to SEQ ID No. 84, and SEQ ID No. 92. For example,
a peptide may be modified so that it at least maintains, if not improves, the ability to interact
with and bind to the binding groove of a suitable MHC molecule, such as HLA-A*02 or -DR,
and in that way it at least maintains, if not improves, the ability to bind to the TCR of activat
ed CTL.
These CTL can subsequently cross-react with cells and kill cells that express a polypeptide
that contains the natural amino acid sequence of the cognate peptide as defined in the aspects
of the invention. As can be derived from the scientific literature (Rammensee et al., 1997)
and databases (Rammensee et al., 1999), certain positions of HLA binding peptides are typi
cally anchor residues forming a core sequence fitting to the binding motif of the HLA recep
tor, which is defined by polar, electrophysical, hydrophobic and spatial properties of the poly
peptide chains constituting the binding groove. Thus one skilled in the art would be able to
modify the amino acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID No. 1 to SEQ ID No. 65 and SEQ ID
No. 76 to SEQ ID No. 84, and SEQ ID No. 92, by maintaining the known anchor residues,
and would be able to determine whether such variants maintain the ability to bind MHC class
I or II molecules. The variants of the present invention retain the ability to bind to the TCR of
activated CTL, which can subsequently cross-react with- and kill cells that express a polypep
tide containing the natural amino acid sequence of the cognate peptide as defined in the as
pects of the invention.
Those amino acid residues that do not substantially contribute to interactions with the T-cell
receptor can be modified by replacement with another amino acid whose incorporation does
not substantially affect T-cell reactivity and does not eliminate binding to the relevant MHC.
Thus, apart from the proviso given, the peptide of the invention may be any peptide (by which
term the inventors include oligopeptide or polypeptide), which includes the amino acid se
quences or a portion or variant thereof as given.

Longer peptides may also be suitable. It is also possible, that MHC class I epitopes, although
usually between 8-11 amino acids long, are generated by peptide processing from longer pep
tides or proteins that include the actual epitope. It is preferred that the residues that flank the
actual epitope are residues that do not substantially affect proteolytic cleavage necessary to
expose the actual epitope during processing.
Accordingly, the present invention also provides peptides and variants of MHC class I
epitopes wherein the peptide or variant has an overall length of between 8 and 100, preferably
between 8 and 30, and most preferred between 8 and 14, namely 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 ami
no acids, in case of the class II binding peptides the length can also be 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
21 or 33 amino acids.
Of course, the peptide or variant according to the present invention will have the ability to
bind to a molecule of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. Binding of
a peptide or a variant to a MHC complex may be tested by methods known in the art.

In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention the peptide consists or consists essen
tially of an amino acid sequence according to SEQ ID No. I to SEQ ID No. 65, and SEQ ID
No. 76 to SEQ ID No. 84, and SEQ ID No. 92.
"Consisting essentially of' shall mean that a peptide according to the present invention, in
addition to the sequence according to any of SEQ ID No. 1 to SEQ ID No. 65, and SEQ ID
No. 76 to SEQ ID No. 84, and SEQ ID No. 92 or a variant thereof contains additional N
and/or C-terminally located stretches of amino acids that are not necessarily forming part of
the peptide that functions as an epitope for MHC molecules epitope.
Nevertheless, these stretches can be important to provide an efficient introduction of the pep
tide according to the present invention into the cells. In one embodiment of the present inven
tion, the peptide is a fusion protein which comprises, for example, the 80 N-terminal amino
acids of the HLA-DR antigen-associated invariant chain (p33, in the following "Ii") as de
rived from the NCBI, GenBank Accession number X00497. In other fusions, the peptides of
the present invention can be fused to an antibody as described herein, or a functional part
thereof, in particular into a sequence of an antibody, so as to be specifically targeted by said
antibody, or, for example, to or into an antibody that is specific for dendritic cells.
In addition, the peptide or variant may be modified further to improve stability and/or binding
to MHC molecules in order to elicit a stronger immune response. Methods for such an optimi
zation of a peptide sequence are well known in the art and include, for example, the introduc
tion of reverse peptide bonds or non-peptide bonds.
In a reverse peptide bond amino acid residues are not joined by peptide (-CO-NH-) linkages
but the peptide bond is reversed. Such retro-inverso peptidomimetics may be made using
methods known in the art, for example such as those described in Meziere et al (1997) J. Im
munol. 159, 3230-3237, incorporated herein by reference. This approach involves making
pseudopeptides containing changes involving the backbone, and not the orientation of side
chains. Meziere et al (1997) show that for MHC binding and T helper cell responses, these
pseudopeptides are useful. Retro-inverse peptides, which contain NH-CO bonds instead of
CO-NH peptide bonds, are much more resistant to proteolysis.
A non-peptide bond is, for example, -CH 2-NH, -CH 2 S-, -CH 2 CH 2 -, -CH=CH-, -COCH 2-,
CH(OH)CH 2-, and -CH 2 SO-. United States Patent 4,897,445 provides a method for the solid
phase synthesis of non-peptide bonds (-CH 2-NH) in polypeptide chains which involves poly
peptides synthesized by standard procedures and the non-peptide bond synthesized by react
ing an amino aldehyde and an amino acid in the presence of NaCNBH 3 .
Peptides comprising the sequences described above may be synthesized with additional chem
ical groups present at their amino and/or carboxy termini, to enhance the stability, bioavaila
bility, and/or affinity of the peptides. For example, hydrophobic groups such as carbobenzox
yl, dansyl, or t-butyloxycarbonyl groups may be added to the peptides' amino termini. Like
wise, an acetyl group or a 9-fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl group may be placed at the peptides'
amino termini. Additionally, the hydrophobic group, t-butyloxycarbonyl, or an amido group
may be added to the peptides' carboxy termini.
Further, the peptides of the invention may be synthesized to alter their steric configuration.
For example, the D-isomer of one or more of the amino acid residues of the peptide may be
used, rather than the usual L-isomer. Still further, at least one of the amino acid residues of

  WO 2015/018805                                                             PCT/EP2014/066755
                                               - 57
the peptides of the invention may be substituted by one of the well-known non-naturally oc
curring amino acid residues. Alterations such as these may serve to increase the stability, bio
availability and/or binding action of the peptides of the invention.
Similarly, a peptide or variant of the invention may be modified chemically by reacting spe
cific amino acids either before or after synthesis of the peptide. Examples for such modifica
tions are well known in the art and are summarized e.g. in R. Lundblad, Chemical Reagents
for Protein Modification, 3rd ed. CRC Press, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Chemical modification of amino acids includes but is not limited to, modification by acyla
tion, amidination, pyridoxylation of lysine, reductive alkylation, trinitrobenzylation of amino
groups with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS), amide modification of carboxyl
groups and sulphydryl modification by performic acid oxidation of cysteine to cysteic acid,
formation of mercurial derivatives, formation of mixed disulphides with other thiol com
pounds, reaction with maleimide, carboxymethylation with iodoacetic acid or iodoacetamide
and carbamoylation with cyanate at alkaline pH, although without limitation thereto. In this
regard, the skilled person is referred to Chapter 15 of Current Protocols In Protein Science,
Eds. Coligan et al. (John Wiley and Sons NY 1995-2000) for more extensive methodology
relating to chemical modification of proteins.
Briefly, modification of e.g. arginyl residues in proteins is often based on the reaction of vici
nal dicarbonyl compounds such as phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, and 1,2-cyclohexanedione
to form an adduct. Another example is the reaction of methylglyoxal with arginine residues.
Cysteine can be modified without concomitant modification of other nucleophilic sites such
as lysine and histidine. As a result, a large number of reagents are available for the modifica
tion of cysteine. The websites of companies such as Sigma-Aldrich (http://www.sigma
aldrich.com) provide information on specific reagents.
Selective reduction of disulfide bonds in proteins is also common. Disulfide bonds can be
formed and oxidized during the heat treatment of biopharmaceuticals.
Woodward's Reagent K may be used to modify specific glutamic acid residues. N-(3
(dimethylamino)propyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide can be used to form intra-molecular crosslinks
between a lysine residue and a glutamic acid residue.
For example, diethylpyrocarbonate is a reagent for the modification of histidyl residues in
proteins. Histidine can also be modified using 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal.
The reaction of lysine residues and other a-amino groups is, for example, useful in binding of
peptides to surfaces or the cross-linking of proteins/peptides. Lysine is the site of attachment
of poly(ethylene)glycol and the major site of modification in the glycosylation of proteins.
Methionine residues in proteins can be modified with e.g. iodoacetamide, bromoethylamine,
and chloramine T.
Tetranitromethane and N-acetylimidazole can be used for the modification of tyrosyl residues.
Cross-linking via the formation of dityrosine can be accomplished with hydrogen perox
ide/copper ions.
Recent studies on the modification of tryptophan have used N-bromosuccinimide, 2-hydroxy
5-nitrobenzyl bromide or 3-bromo-3-methyl-2-(2-nitrophenylmercapto)-3H-indole (BPNS
skatole).

Successful modification of therapeutic proteins and peptides with PEG is often associated
with an extension of circulatory half-life while cross-linking of proteins with glutaraldehyde,
polyethyleneglycol diacrylate and formaldehyde is used for the preparation of hydrogels.
Chemical modification of allergens for immunotherapy is often achieved by carbamylation
with potassium cyanate.
A peptide or variant, wherein the peptide is modified or includes non-peptide bonds is a pre
ferred embodiment of the invention. Generally, peptides and variants (at least those contain
ing peptide linkages between amino acid residues) may be synthesized by the Fmoc
polyamide mode of solid-phase peptide synthesis as disclosed by Lu et al (1981) and refer
ences therein. Temporary N-amino group protection is afforded by the 9
fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group. Repetitive cleavage of this highly base-labile pro
tecting group is done using 20% piperidine in N, N-dimethylformamide. Side-chain function
alities may be protected as their butyl ethers (in the case of serine threonine and tyrosine),
butyl esters (in the case of glutamic acid and aspartic acid), butyloxycarbonyl derivative (in
the case of lysine and histidine), trityl derivative (in the case of cysteine) and 4-methoxy
2,3,6-trimethylbenzenesulphonyl derivative (in the case of arginine). Where glutamine or as
paragine are C-terminal residues, use is made of the 4,4'-dimethoxybenzhydryl group for pro
tection of the side chain amido functionalities. The solid-phase support is based on a polydi
methyl-acrylamide polymer constituted from the three monomers dimethylacrylamide (back
bone-monomer), bisacryloylethylene diamine (cross linker) and acryloylsarcosine methyl es
ter (functionalizing agent). The peptide-to-resin cleavable linked agent used is the acid-labile
4-hydroxymethyl-phenoxyacetic acid derivative. All amino acid derivatives are added as their
preformed symmetrical anhydride derivatives with the exception of asparagine and glutamine,
which are added using a reversed N, N-dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide/1hydroxybenzotriazole
mediated coupling procedure. All coupling and deprotection reactions are monitored using
ninhydrin, trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid or isotin test procedures. Upon completion of syn
thesis, peptides are cleaved from the resin support with concomitant removal of side-chain
protecting groups by treatment with 95% trifluoroacetic acid containing a 50 % scavenger
mix. Scavengers commonly used include ethandithiol, phenol, anisole and water, the exact
choice depending on the constituent amino acids of the peptide being synthesized. Also a
combination of solid phase and solution phase methodologies for the synthesis of peptides is
possible (see, for example (Bruckdorfer et al., 2004) and the references as cited therein).
Trifluoroacetic acid is removed by evaporation in vacuo, with subsequent trituration with di
ethyl ether affording the crude peptide. Any scavengers present are removed by a simple ex
traction procedure which on lyophilisation of the aqueous phase affords the crude peptide free
of scavengers. Reagents for peptide synthesis are generally available from e.g. Calbiochem
Novabiochem (UK) Ltd, Nottingham NG7 2QJ, UK.
Purification may be performed by any one, or a combination of, techniques such as re
crystallization, size exclusion chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic
interaction chromatography and (usually) reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatog
raphy using e.g. acetonitril/water gradient separation.
Analysis of peptides may be carried out using thin layer chromatography, electrophoresis, in
particular capillary electrophoresis, solid phase extraction (CSPE), reverse-phase high per
formance liquid chromatography, amino-acid analysis after acid hydrolysis and by fast atom
bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometric analysis, as well as MALDI and ESI-Q-TOF mass
spectrometric analysis.

A further aspect of the invention provides a nucleic acid (for example a polynucleotide) en
 coding a peptide or peptide variant of the invention. The polynucleotide may be, for example,
DNA, cDNA, PNA, RNA or combinations thereof, either single- and/or double-stranded, or
native or stabilized forms of polynucleotides, such as, for example, polynucleotides with a
phosphorothioate backbone and it may or may not contain introns so long as it codes for the
peptide. Of course, only peptides that contain naturally occurring amino acid residues joined
by naturally occurring peptide bonds are encodable by a polynucleotide. A still further aspect
of the invention provides an expression vector capable of expressing a polypeptide according
to the invention.
A variety of methods have been developed to link polynucleotides, especially DNA, to vec
tors for example via complementary cohesive termini. For instance, complementary homo
polymer tracts can be added to the DNA segment to be inserted to the vector DNA. The vec
tor and DNA segment are then joined by hydrogen bonding between the complementary ho
mopolymeric tails to form recombinant DNA molecules.
 Synthetic linkers containing one or more restriction sites provide an alternative method of
joining the DNA segment to vectors. Synthetic linkers containing a variety of restriction en
 donuclease sites are commercially available from a number of sources including International
Biotechnologies Inc. New Haven, CN, USA.
A desirable method of modifying the DNA encoding the polypeptide of the invention em
ploys the polymerase chain reaction as disclosed by (Saiki et al., 1988)). This method may be
used for introducing the DNA into a suitable vector, for example by engineering in suitable
restriction sites, or it may be used to modify the DNA in other useful ways as is known in the
 art. If viral vectors are used, pox- or adenovirus vectors are preferred.
The DNA (or in the case of retroviral vectors, RNA) may then be expressed in a suitable host
to produce a polypeptide comprising the peptide or variant of the invention. Thus, the DNA
 encoding the peptide or variant of the invention may be used in accordance with known tech
niques, appropriately modified in view of the teachings contained herein, to construct an ex
pression vector, which is then used to transform an appropriate host cell for the expression
 and production of the polypeptide of the invention. Such techniques include those disclosed in
US Patent Nos. 4,440,859, 4,530,901, 4,582,800, 4,677,063, 4,678,751, 4,704,362, 4,710,463,
4,757,006, 4,766,075, and 4,810,648.
The DNA (or in the case of retroviral vectors, RNA) encoding the polypeptide constituting
the compound of the invention may be joined to a wide variety of other DNA sequences for
introduction into an appropriate host. The companion DNA will depend upon the nature of the
host, the manner of the introduction of the DNA into the host, and whether episomal mainte
nance or integration is desired.
 Generally, the DNA is inserted into an expression vector, such as a plasmid, in proper orienta
tion and correct reading frame for expression. If necessary, the DNA may be linked to the
 appropriate transcriptional and translational regulatory control nucleotide sequences recog
nized by the desired host, although such controls are generally available in the expression
vector. The vector is then introduced into the host through standard techniques. Generally, not
 all of the hosts will be transformed by the vector. Therefore, it will be necessary to select for
transformed host cells. One selection technique involves incorporating into the expression

  WO 2015/018805                                                               PCT/EP2014/066755

vector a DNA sequence, with any necessary control elements, that codes for a selectable trait
in the transformed cell, such as antibiotic resistance.
Alternatively, the gene for such selectable trait can be on another vector, which is used to co
transform the desired host cell.
Host cells that have been transformed by the recombinant DNA of the invention are then cul
tured for a sufficient time and under appropriate conditions known to those skilled in the art in
view of the teachings disclosed herein to permit the expression of the polypeptide, which can
then be recovered.
Many expression systems are known, including bacteria (for example E. coli and Bacillus
subtilis), yeasts (for example Saccharomyces cerevisiae), filamentous fungi (for example As
pergillus spec.), plant cells, animal cells and insect cells. Preferably, the system can be mam
malian cells such as CHO cells available from the ATCC Cell Biology Collection.
A typical mammalian cell vector plasmid for constitutive expression comprises the CMV or
SV40 promoter with a suitable poly A tail and a resistance marker, such as neomycin. One
example is pSVL available from Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA. An example of an induci
ble mammalian expression vector is pMSG, also available from Pharmacia. Useful yeast
plasmid vectors are pRS403-406 and pRS413-416 and are generally available from Stratagene
Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA. Plasmids pRS403, pRS404, pRS405 and
pRS406 are Yeast Integrating plasmids (YIps) and incorporate the yeast selectable markers
HIS3, TRP1, LEU2 and URA3. Plasmids pRS413-416 are Yeast Centromere plasmids
(Ycps). CMV promoter-based vectors (for example from Sigma-Aldrich) provide transient or
stable expression, cytoplasmic expression or secretion, and N-terminal or C-terminal tagging
in various combinations of FLAG, 3xFLAG, c-myc or MAT. These fusion proteins allow for
detection, purification and analysis of recombinant protein. Dual-tagged fusions provide flex
ibility in detection.
The strong human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter regulatory region drives constitutive
protein expression levels as high as 1 mg/L in COS cells. For less potent cell lines, protein
levels are typically -0. 1 mg/L. The presence of the SV40 replication origin will result in high
levels of DNA replication in SV40 replication permissive COS cells. CMV vectors, for ex
ample, can contain the pMB1 (derivative of pBR322) origin for replication in bacterial cells,
the b-lactamase gene for ampicillin resistance selection in bacteria, hGH polyA, and the fl
origin. Vectors containing the preprotrypsin leader (PPT) sequence can direct the secretion of
FLAG fusion proteins into the culture medium for purification using ANTI-FLAG antibodies,
resins, and plates. Other vectors and expression systems are well known in the art for use with
a variety of host cells.
In another embodiment two or more peptides or peptide variants of the invention are encoded
and thus expressed in a successive order (similar to "beads on a string" constructs). In doing
so, the peptides or peptide variants may be linked or fused together by stretches of linker ami
no acids, such as for example LLLLLL, or may be linked without any additional peptide(s)
between them.
The present invention also relates to a host cell transformed with a polynucleotide vector con
struct of the present invention. The host cell can be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Bacterial
cells may be preferred prokaryotic host cells in some circumstances and typically are a strain
of E. coli such as, for example, the E. coli strains DH5 available from Bethesda Research La-

boratories Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA, and RR1 available from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) of Rockville, MD, USA (No ATCC 31343). Preferred eukaryotic host
cells include yeast, insect and mammalian cells, preferably vertebrate cells such as those from
a mouse, rat, monkey or human fibroblastic and colon cell lines. Yeast host cells include
YPH499, YPH500 and YPH501, which are generally available from Stratagene Cloning Sys
tems, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA. Preferred mammalian host cells include Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) cells available from the ATCC as CCL61, NIH Swiss mouse embryo cells
NIH/3T3 available from the ATCC as CRL 1658, monkey kidney-derived COS-1 cells avail
able from the ATCC as CRL 1650 and 293 cells which are human embryonic kidney cells.
Preferred insect cells are Sf9 cells which can be transfected with baculovirus expression vec
tors. An overview regarding the choice of suitable host cells for expression can be found in,
for example, the textbook of Paulina Balbis and Argelia Lorence "Methods in Molecular Bi
ology Recombinant Gene Expression, Reviews and Protocols," Part One, Second Edition,
ISBN 978-1-58829-262-9, and other literature known to the person of skill.
Transformation of appropriate cell hosts with a DNA construct of the present invention is
accomplished by well-known methods that typically depend on the type of vector used. With
regard to transformation of prokaryotic host cells, see, for example, Cohen et al (1972) Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 69, 2110, and Sambrook et al (1989) Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory
Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. Transformation of yeast
cells is described in Sherman et al (1986) Methods In Yeast Genetics, A Laboratory Manual,
Cold Spring Harbor, NY. The method of Beggs (1978) Nature 275,104-109 is also useful.
With regard to vertebrate cells, reagents useful in transfecting such cells, for example calcium
phosphate and DEAE-dextran or liposome formulations, are available from Stratagene Clon
ing Systems, or Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD 20877, USA. Electroporation is
also useful for transforming and/or transfecting cells and is well known in the art for trans
forming yeast cell, bacterial cells, insect cells and vertebrate cells.
Successfully transformed cells, i.e. cells that contain a DNA construct of the present inven
tion, can be identified by well-known techniques such as PCR. Alternatively, the presence of
the protein in the supernatant can be detected using antibodies.
It will be appreciated that certain host cells of the invention are useful in the preparation of the
peptides of the invention, for example bacterial, yeast and insect cells. However, other host
cells may be useful in certain therapeutic methods. For example, antigen-presenting cells,
such as dendritic cells, may usefully be used to express the peptides of the invention such that
they may be loaded into appropriate MHC molecules. Thus, the current invention provides a
host cell comprising a nucleic acid or an expression vector according to the invention.
In a preferred embodiment    the host cell is an antigen presenting cell, in particular a dendritic
cell or antigen presenting   cell. APCs loaded with a recombinant fusion protein containing
prostatic acid phosphatase   (PAP) are currently under investigation for the treatment of pros
tate cancer (Sipuleucel-T)   (Small et al., 2006; Rini et al., 2006).
A further aspect of the invention provides a method of producing a peptide or its variant, the
method comprising culturing a host cell and isolating the peptide from the host cell or its cul
ture medium.
In another embodiment the peptide, the nucleic acid or the expression vector of the invention
are used in medicine. For example, the peptide or its variant may be prepared for intravenous
(i.v.) injection, sub-cutaneous (s.c.) injection, intradermal (i.d.) injection, intraperitoneal (i.p.)

                                                - 62
injection, intramuscular (i.m.) injection. Preferred methods of peptide injection include s.c.,
i.d., i.p., i.m., and i.v. Preferred methods of DNA injection include i.d., i.m., s.c., i.p. and i.v.
Doses of e.g. between 50 ptg and 1.5 mg, preferably 125 pg to 500 pg, of peptide or DNA
may be given and will depend on the respective peptide or DNA. Dosages of this range were
successfully used in previous trials (Walter et al Nature Medicine 18, 1254-1261 (2012)).
Another aspect of the present invention includes an in vitro method for producing activated T
cells, the method comprising contacting in vitro T cells with antigen loaded human MHC
molecules expressed on the surface of a suitable antigen-presenting cell for a period of time
sufficient to activate the T cell in an antigen specific manner, wherein the antigen is a peptide
according to the invention. Preferably a sufficient amount of the antigen is used with an anti
gen-presenting cell.
Preferably the mammalian cell lacks or has a reduced level or function of the TAP peptide
transporter. Suitable cells that lack the TAP peptide transporter include T2, RMA-S and Dro
sophila cells. TAP is the transporter associated with antigen processing.
The human peptide loading deficient cell line T2 is available from the American Type Culture
Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20852, USA under Catalogue No
CRL 1992; the Drosophila cell line Schneider line 2 is available from the ATCC under Cata
logue No CRL 19863; the mouse RMA-S cell line is described in Karre et al 1985.
Preferably, the host cell before transfection expresses substantially no MHC class I molecules.
It is also preferred that the stimulator cell expresses a molecule important for providing a co
stimulatory signal for T-cells such as any of B7. 1, B7.2, ICAM- 1 and LFA 3. The nucleic
acid sequences of numerous MHC class I molecules and of the co-stimulator molecules are
publicly available from the GenBank and EMBL databases.
In case of a MHC class I epitope being used as an antigen, the T cells are CD8-positive CTLs.
If an antigen-presenting cell is transfected to express such an epitope, preferably the cell com
prises an expression vector capable of expressing a peptide containing SEQ ID No. I to SEQ
ID No. 65, and SEQ ID No. 76 to SEQ ID No. 84, and SEQ ID No. 92, or a variant amino
acid sequence thereof.
A number of other methods may be used for generating CTL in vitro. For example, the meth
ods described in Peoples et al (1995) and Kawakami et al (1992) use autologous tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes in the generation of CTL. Plebanski et al (1995) makes use of autol
ogous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PLBs) in the preparation of CTL. Jochmus et al (1997)
describes the production of autologous CTL by pulsing dendritic cells with peptide or poly
peptide, or via infection with recombinant virus. Hill et al (1995) and Jerome et al (1993)
make use of B cells in the production of autologous CTL. In addition, macrophages pulsed
with peptide or polypeptide, or infected with recombinant virus, may be used in the prepara
tion of autologous CTL. S. Walter et al. 2003 describe the in vitro priming of T cells by using
artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs), which is also a suitable way for generating T cells
against the peptide of choice. In this study, aAPCs were generated by the coupling of pre
formed MHC:peptide complexes to the surface of polystyrene particles (microbeads) by bio
tin:streptavidin biochemistry. This system permits the exact control of the MHC density on
aAPCs, which allows to selectively elicit high- or low-avidity antigen-specific T cell respons
es with high efficiency from blood samples. Apart from MHC:peptide complexes, aAPCs
should carry other proteins with co-stimulatory activity like anti-CD28 antibodies coupled to

  WO 2015/018805                                                              PCT/EP2014/066755
                                                - 63
their surface. Furthermore such aAPC-based systems often require the addition of appropriate
soluble factors, e. g. cytokines like interleukin-12.
Allogeneic cells may also be used in the preparation of T cells and a method is described in
detail in WO 97/26328, incorporated herein by reference. For example, in addition to Dro
sophila cells and T2 cells, other cells may be used to present antigens such as CHO cells, bac
ulovirus-infected insect cells, bacteria, yeast, vaccinia-infected target cells. In addition plant
viruses may be used (see, for example, Porta et al (1994)) which describes the development of
cowpea mosaic virus as a high-yielding system for the presentation of foreign peptides.
The activated T cells that are directed against the peptides of the invention are useful in thera
py. Thus, a further aspect of the invention provides activated T cells obtainable by the forego
ing methods of the invention.
Activated T cells, which are produced by the above method, will selectively recognize a cell
that aberrantly expresses a polypeptide that comprises an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No.
I to SEQ ID No. 92, preferably a sequence of SEQ ID No. I to SEQ ID No. 65, and SEQ ID
No. 76 to SEQ ID No. 84, and SEQ ID No. 92.
Preferably, the T cell recognizes the cell by interacting through its TCR with the
HLA/peptide-complex (for example, binding). The T cells are useful in a method of killing
target cells in a patient whose target cells aberrantly express a polypeptide comprising an
amino acid sequence of the invention wherein the patient is administered an effective number
of the activated T cells. The T cells that are administered to the patient may be derived from
the patient and activated as described above (i.e. they are autologous T cells). Alternatively,
the T cells are not from the patient but are from another individual. Of course, it is preferred if
the individual is a healthy individual. By "healthy individual" the inventors mean that the in
dividual is generally in good health, preferably has a competent immune system and, more
preferably, is not suffering from any disease that can be readily tested for, and detected.
In vivo, the target cells for the CD8-positive T cells according to the present invention can be
cells of the tumor (which sometimes express MHC class II) and/or stromal cells surrounding
the tumor (tumor cells) (which sometimes also express MHC class II; (Dengjel et al., 2006)).
The T cells of the present invention may be used as active ingredients of a therapeutic compo
sition. Thus, the invention also provides a method of killing target cells in a patient whose
target cells aberrantly express a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence of the inven
tion, the method comprising administering to the patient an effective number of T cells as
defined above.
By "aberrantly expressed" the inventors also mean that the polypeptide is over-expressed
compared to normal levels of expression or that the gene is silent in the tissue from which the
tumor is derived but in the tumor it is expressed. By "over-expressed" the inventors mean that
the polypeptide is present at a level at least 1.2-fold of that present in normal tissue; prefera
bly at least 2-fold, and more preferably at least 5-fold or 10-fold the level present in normal
tissue.
T cells may be obtained by methods known in the art, e.g. those described above.
Protocols for this so-called adoptive transfer of T cells are well known in the art. Reviews can
be found in (Gattinoni et al., 2006) and (Morgan et al., 2006).

Any molecule of the invention, i.e. the peptide, nucleic acid, antibody, expression vector, cell,
activated CTL, T-cell receptor or the nucleic acid encoding it is useful for the treatment of
disorders, characterized by cells escaping an immune response. Therefore any molecule of the
present invention may be used as medicament or in the manufacture of a medicament. The
molecule may be used by itself or combined with other molecule(s) of the invention or (a)
known molecule(s).
Preferably, the medicament of the present invention is a vaccine. It may be administered di
rectly into the patient, into the affected organ or systemically i.d., i.m., s.c., i.p. and i.v., or
applied ex vivo to cells derived from the patient or a human cell line which are subsequently
administered to the patient, or used in vitro to select a subpopulation of immune cells derived
from the patient, which are then re-administered to the patient. If the nucleic acid is adminis
tered to cells in vitro, it may be useful for the cells to be transfected so as to co-express im
mune-stimulating cytokines, such as interleukin-2. The peptide may be substantially pure, or
combined with an immune-stimulating adjuvant (see below) or used in combination with im
mune-stimulatory cytokines, or be administered with a suitable delivery system, for example
liposomes. The peptide may also be conjugated to a suitable carrier such as keyhole limpet
haemocyanin (KLH) or mannan (see WO 95/18145 and Longenecker, 1993). The peptide
may also be tagged, may be a fusion protein, or may be a hybrid molecule. The peptides
whose sequence is given in the present invention are expected to stimulate CD4 or CD8 T
cells. However, stimulation of CD8 CTLs is more efficient in the presence of help provided
by CD4 T-helper cells. Thus, for MHC Class I epitopes that stimulate CD8 CTL the fusion
partner or sections of a hybrid molecule suitably provide epitopes which stimulate CD4
positive T cells. CD4- and CD8-stimulating epitopes are well known in the art and include
those identified in the present invention.
In one aspect, the vaccine comprises at least one peptide having the amino acid sequence set
forth SEQ ID No. 1 to SEQ ID No. 92 and at least one additional peptide, preferably two to
50, more preferably two to 25, even more preferably two to 20 and most preferably two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, sev
enteen or eighteen peptides. The peptide(s) may be derived from one or more specific TAAs
and may bind to MHC class I molecules.
In another aspect, the vaccine comprises at least one peptide having the amino acid sequence
set forth SEQ ID No. I to SEQ ID No. 65 and SEQ ID No. 76 to SEQ ID No. 84, and SEQ ID
No. 92, and at least one additional peptide, preferably two to 50, more preferably two to 25,
even more preferably two to 20 and most preferably two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen or eighteen peptides.
The peptide(s) may be derived from one or more specific TAAs and may bind to MHC class I
molecules.
The polynucleotide may be substantially pure, or contained in a suitable vector or delivery
system. The nucleic acid may be DNA, cDNA, PNA, RNA or a combination thereof Meth
ods for designing and introducing such a nucleic acid are well known in the art. An overview
is provided by e.g. (Pascolo et al., 2005). Polynucleotide vaccines are easy to prepare, but the
mode of action of these vectors in inducing an immune response is not fully understood. Suit
able vectors and delivery systems include viral DNA and/or RNA, such as systems based on
adenovirus, vaccinia virus, retroviruses, herpes virus, adeno-associated virus or hybrids con
taining elements of more than one virus. Non-viral delivery systems include cationic lipids
and cationic polymers and are well known in the art of DNA delivery. Physical delivery, such

as via a "gene-gun," may also be used. The peptide or peptides encoded by the nucleic acid
may be a fusion protein, for example with an epitope that stimulates T cells for the respective
opposite CDR as noted above.
The medicament of the invention may also include one or more adjuvants. Adjuvants are sub
stances that non-specifically enhance or potentiate the immune response (e.g., immune re
sponses mediated by CTLs and helper-T (TH) cells to an antigen, and would thus be consid
ered useful in the medicament of the present invention. Suitable adjuvants include, but are not
limited to, 1018 ISS, aluminium salts, AMPLIVAX*, AS15, BCG, CP-870,893, CpG7909,
CyaA, dSLIM, flagellin or TLR5 ligands derived from flagellin, FLT3 ligand, GM-CSF,
IC30, IC31, Imiquimod (ALDARA*), resiquimod, ImuFact IMP321, Interleukins as IL-2, IL

Montanide IMS 1312, Montanide ISA 206, Montanide ISA 50V, Montanide ISA-51, water
in-oil and oil-in-water emulsions, OK-432, OM-174, OM-197-MP-EC, ONTAK, OspA, Pep
Tel@ vector system, poly(lactid co-glycolid) [PLG]-based and dextran microparticles, talac
toferrin SRL 172, Virosomes and other Virus-like particles, YF-17D, VEGF trap, R848, beta
glucan, Pam3Cys, Aquila's QS21 stimulon, which is derived from saponin, mycobacterial
extracts and synthetic bacterial cell wall mimics, and other proprietary adjuvants such as
Ribi's Detox, Quil, or Superfos. Adjuvants such as Freund's or GM-CSF are preferred. Several
immunological adjuvants (e.g., MF59) specific for dendritic cells and their preparation have
been described previously (Allison and Krummel, 1995; Allison and Krummel, 1995). Also
cytokines may be used. Several cytokines have been directly linked to influencing dendritic
cell migration to lymphoid tissues (e.g., TNF-), accelerating the maturation of dendritic cells
into efficient antigen-presenting cells for T-lymphocytes (e.g., GM-CSF, IL-I and IL-4) (U.S.
Pat. No. 5,849,589, specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) and acting as
immunoadjuvants (e.g., IL-12, IL-15, IL-23, IL-7, IFN-alpha. IFN-beta) (Gabrilovich, 1996).
CpG immunostimulatory oligonucleotides have also been reported to enhance the effects of
adjuvants in a vaccine setting. Without being bound by theory, CpG oligonucleotides act by
activating the innate (non-adaptive) immune system via Toll-like receptors (TLR), mainly
TLR9. CpG triggered TLR9 activation enhances antigen-specific humoral and cellular re
sponses to a wide variety of antigens, including peptide or protein antigens, live or killed vi
ruses, dendritic cell vaccines, autologous cellular vaccines and polysaccharide conjugates in
both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. More importantly it enhances dendritic cell matu
ration and differentiation, resulting in enhanced activation of T H1 cells and strong cytotoxic T
lymphocyte (CTL) generation, even in the absence of CD4 T cell help. The T H1 bias induced
by TLR9 stimulation is maintained even in the presence of vaccine adjuvants such as alum or
incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) that normally promote a TH2 bias. CpG oligonucleotides
show even greater adjuvant activity when formulated or co-administered with other adjuvants
or in formulations such as microparticles, nanoparticles, lipid emulsions or similar formula
tions, which are especially necessary for inducing a strong response when the antigen is rela
tively weak. They also accelerate the immune response and enable the antigen doses to be
reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude, with comparable antibody responses to
the full-dose vaccine without CpG in some experiments (Krieg, 2006). US Pat. No. 6,406,705
BI describes the combined use of CpG oligonucleotides, non-nucleic acid adjuvants and an
antigen to induce an antigen-specific immune response. A CpG TLR9 antagonist is dSLIM
(double Stem Loop Immunomodulator) by Mologen (Berlin, Germany) which is a preferred
component of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Other TLR binding
molecules such as RNA binding TLR 7, TLR 8 and/or TLR 9 may also be used.

  WO 2015/018805                                                            PCT/EP2014/066755

Other examples for useful adjuvants include, but are not limited to chemically modified CpGs
(e.g. CpR, Idera), dsRNA analogues such as Poly(I:C) and derivates thereof (e.g. Am
pliGen@, Hiltonol@, poly-(ICLC), poly(IC-R), poly(I:C12U), non-CpG bacterial DNA or
RNA as well as immunoactive small molecules and antibodies such as cyclophosphamide,
sunitinib, Bevacizumab, celebrex, NCX-4016, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, sorafenib,
temozolomide, temsirolimus, XL-999, CP-547632, pazopanib, VEGF Trap, ZD2171,
AZD2171, anti-CTLA4, other antibodies targeting key structures of the immune system (e.g.
anti-CD40, anti-TGFbeta, anti-TNFalpha receptor) and SC58175, which may act therapeuti
cally and/or as an adjuvant. The amounts and concentrations of adjuvants and additives useful
in the context of the present invention can readily be determined by the skilled artisan without
undue experimentation.
Preferred adjuvants are imiquimod, resiquimod, GM-CSF, cyclophosphamide, sunitinib,
bevacizumab, interferon-alpha, CpG oligonucleotides and derivates, poly-(I:C) and derivates,
RNA, sildenafil, and particulate formulations with PLG or virosomes.
In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention the
adjuvant is selected from the group consisting of colony-stimulating factors, such as Granulo
cyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF, sargramostim), cyclophosphamide,
imiquimod, resiquimod, and interferon-alpha.
In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention the
adjuvant is selected from the group consisting of colony-stimulating factors, such as Granulo
cyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF, sargramostim), cyclophosphamide,
immiquimod and resiquimod.
In a preferred embodiment of the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention, the
adjuvant is cyclophosphamide, imiquimod or resiquimod.
Even more preferred adjuvants are Montanide IMS 1312, Montanide ISA 206, Montanide
ISA 50V, Montanide ISA-51, poly-ICLC (Hiltonol) and anti-CD40 mAB or combinations
thereof .
This composition is used for parenteral administration, such as subcutaneous, intradermal,
intramuscular or oral administration. For this, the peptides and optionally other molecules are
dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable, preferably aqueous carrier. In addi
tion, the composition can contain excipients, such as buffers, binding agents, blasting agents,
diluents, flavours, lubricants, etc. The peptides can also be administered together with im
mune stimulating substances, such as cytokines. An extensive listing of excipients that can be
used in such a composition, can be, for example, taken from A. Kibbe, Handbook of Pharma
ceutical Excipients, 3 rd Ed., 2000, American Pharmaceutical Association and pharmaceutical
press. The composition can be used for a prevention, prophylaxis and/or therapy of adeno
mateous or cancerous diseases. Exemplary formulations can be found in, for example,
EP2113253.
Nevertheless depending on the number and the physico-chemical characteristics of the pep
tides of the invention further research is needed to provide formulations for specific combina
tions of peptides, especially combinations with more than 20 peptides that are stable for more
than 12 to 18 months.

EXAMPLES
EXAMPLE 1:
Identification and quantitation of tumor associated peptides presented on the cell sur
face
Tissue samples
Patients' tumor tissues were provided by University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.
Written informed consents of all patients had been given before surgery. Tissues were shock
frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after surgery and stored until isolation of TUMAPs at
800 C.
Isolation of HLA peptides from tissue samples
HLA peptide pools from shock-frozen tissue samples were obtained by immune precipitation
from solid tissues according to a slightly modified protocol (Falk, K., 1991; Seeger, F.H.T.,
1999) using the HLA-A*02-specific antibody BB7.2, the HLA-A, -B, -C-specific antibody
W6/32, CNBr-activated sepharose, acid treatment, and ultrafiltration.
Methods
The HLA peptide pools as obtained were separated according to their hydrophobicity by re
versed-phase chromatography (Acquity UPLC system, Waters) and the eluting peptides were
analyzed in an LTQ-Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron) equipped with an
ESI source. Peptide pools were loaded directly onto the analytical fused-silica micro-capillary

column (75 ptm i.d. x 250 mm) packed with 1.7 ptm C18 reversed-phase material (Waters)
applying a flow rate of 400 nL per minute. Subsequently, the peptides were separated using a
two-step 180 minute-binary gradient from 10% to 33% B at a flow rate of 300 nL per minute.
The gradient was composed of Solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1%
formic acid in acetonitrile). A gold coated glass capillary (PicoTip, New Objective) was used
for introduction into the nanoESI source. The LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer was operated
in the data-dependent mode using a TOP5 strategy. In brief, a scan cycle was initiated with a
full scan of high mass accuracy in the orbitrap (R = 30 000), which was followed by MS/MS
scans also in the orbitrap (R = 7500) on the 5 most abundant precursor ions with dynamic
exclusion of previously selected ions. Tandem mass spectra were interpreted by SEQUEST
and additional manual control. The identified peptide sequence was assured by comparison of
the generated natural peptide fragmentation pattern with the fragmentation pattern of a syn
thetic sequence-identical reference peptide. Fig 1 shows an exemplary spectrum obtained
from tumor tissue for the MHC class I associated peptide ABCA13-001 and its elution profile
on the UPLC system.
Label-free relative LC-MS quantitation was performed by ion counting i.e. by extraction and
analysis of LC-MS features (Mueller et al. 2007a). The method assumes that the peptide's
LC-MS signal area correlates with its abundance in the sample. Extracted features were fur
ther processed by charge state deconvolution and retention time alignment (Mueller et al.
2007b; Sturm et al. 2008). Finally, all LC-MS features were cross-referenced with the se
quence identification results to combine quantitative data of different samples and tissues to
peptide presentation profiles. The quantitative data were normalized in a two-tier fashion ac
cording to central tendency to account for variation within technical and biological replicates.
Thus each identified peptide can be associated with quantitative data allowing relative quanti
fication between samples and tissues. In addition, all quantitative data acquired for peptide
candidates was inspected manually to assure data consistency and to verify the accuracy of
the automated analysis. For each peptide a presentation profile was calculated showing the
mean sample presentation as well as replicate variations. The profile juxtaposes NSCLC sam
ples to a baseline of normal tissue samples.
Presentation profiles of exemplary over-presented peptides are shown in Figure 3.
EXAMPLE 2
Expression profiling of genes encoding the peptides of the invention
Not all peptides identified as being presented on the surface of tumor cells by MHC mole
cules are suitable for immunotherapy, because the majority of these peptides are derived from
normal cellular proteins expressed by many cell types. Only few of these peptides are tumor
associated and likely able to induce T cells with a high specificity of recognition for the tumor
from which they were derived. In order to identify such peptides and minimize the risk for
autoimmunity induced by vaccination the inventors focused on those peptides that are derived
from proteins that are over-expressed on tumor cells compared to the majority of normal tis
sues.
The ideal peptide will be derived from a protein that is unique to the tumor   and not present in
any other tissue. To identify peptides that are derived from genes with an     expression profile
similar to the ideal one the identified peptides were assigned to the proteins and genes, respec
tively, from which they were derived and expression profiles of these genes    were generated.

tient. Tumor tissue specimens were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after surgery
and later homogenized with mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was prepared
from these samples using TRI Reagent (Ambion, Darmstadt, Germany) followed by a cleanup
with RNeasy (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany); both methods were performed according to the
manufacturer's protocol.
Total RNA from healthy human tissues was obtained commercially (Ambion, Huntingdon,
UK; Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany; Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands; BioChain, Hay
ward, CA, USA). The RNA from several individuals (between 2 and 123 individuals) was
mixed such that RNA from each individual was equally weighted.
Quality and quantity of all RNA samples were assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Ag
ilent, Waldbronn, Germany) using the RNA 6000 Pico LabChip Kit (Agilent).
Microarray experiments
Gene expression analysis of all tumor and normal tissue RNA samples was performed by
Affymetrix Human Genome (HG) U133A or HG-U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide microarrays
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). All steps were carried out according to the Affymetrix
manual. Briefly, double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 5-8 pg of total RNA, using
SuperScript RTII (Invitrogen) and the oligo-dT-T7 primer (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Ger
many) as described in the manual. In vitro transcription was performed with the BioArray
High Yield RNA Transcript Labelling Kit (ENZO Diagnostics, Inc., Farmingdale, NY, USA)
for the U133A arrays or with the GeneChip IVT Labelling Kit (Affymetrix) for the U133 Plus
2.0 arrays, followed by cRNA fragmentation, hybridization, and staining with streptavidin
phycoerythrin and biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibody (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Nether
lands). Images were scanned with the Agilent 2500A GeneArray Scanner (U133A) or the
Affymetrix Gene-Chip Scanner 3000 (U133 Plus 2.0), and data were analyzed with the GCOS
software (Affymetrix), using default settings for all parameters. For normalisation, 100
housekeeping genes provided by Affymetrix were used. Relative expression values were cal
culated from the signal log ratios given by the software and the normal kidney sample was
arbitrarily set to 1.0.
Exemplary expression profiles of source genes of the present invention that are highly over
expressed or exclusively expressed in non-small-cell lung carcinoma are shown in Fig. 2.
EXAMPLE 4
In vitro immunogenicity for NSCLC MHC class I presented peptides
In order to obtain information regarding the immunogenicity of the TUMAPs of the present
invention, we performed investigations using an in vitro T-cell priming assay based on re
peated stimulations of CD8+ T cells with artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs) loaded
with peptide/MHC complexes and anti-CD28 antibody. This way we could show immunogen
icity for 9 HLA-A*0201 restricted TUMAPs of the invention so far, demonstrating that these
peptides are T-cell epitopes against which CD8+ precursor T cells exist in humans (Table 4).
In vitro priming of CD8+ T cells
In order to perform in vitro stimulations by artificial antigen presenting cells loaded with pep
tide-MHC complex (pMHC) and anti-CD28 antibody, we first isolated CD8+ T cells from
fresh HLA-A*02 leukapheresis products via positive selection using CD8 microbeads (Mil-

tenyi Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany) of healthy donors obtained from the Transfusion
Medicine Tuebingen, Germany, after informed consent.
Isolated CD8+ lymphocytes or PBMCs were incubated until use in T-cell medium (TCM)
consisting of RPMI-Glutamax (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 10% heat
inactivated human AB serum (PAN-Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany), 100 U/ml Penicillin / 100
ptg/ml Streptomycin (Cambrex, Cologne, Germany), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (CC Pro, Ober
dorla, Germany), 20 pg/ml Gentamycin (Cambrex). 2.5 ng/ml IL-7 (PromoCell, Heidelberg,
Germany) and 10 U/ml IL-2 (Novartis Pharma, Numberg, Germany) were also added to the
TCM at this step.
Generation of pMHC/anti-CD28 coated beads, T-cell stimulations and readout was performed
in a highly defined in vitro system using four different pMHC molecules per stimulation con
dition and 8 different pMHC molecules per readout condition.
All pMHC complexes used for aAPC loading and cytometric readout were derived from UV
induced MHC ligand exchange (Rodenko et al., 2006) with minor modifications. In order to
determine the amount of pMHC monomer obtained by exchange we performed streptavidin
based sandwich ELISAs according to (Rodenko et al., 2006).
The purified co-stimulatory mouse IgG2a anti human CD28 Ab 9.3 (Jung et al., 1987) was
chemically biotinylated using Sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin as recommended by the
manufacturer (Perbio, Bonn, Germany). Beads used were 5.6 pm diameter streptavidin coated
polystyrene particles (Bangs Laboratories, Illinois, USA).
pMHC used for positive and negative control stimulations were A*0201/MLA-001 (peptide
ELAGIGILTV from modified Melan-A/MART-1) and A*0201/DDX5-001 (YLLPAIVHI
from DDX5), respectively.
800.000 beads / 200 pl were coated in 96-well plates in the presence of 4 x 12.5 ng different
biotin-pMHC, washed and 600 ng biotin anti-CD28 were added subsequently in a volume of
200 pl. Stimulations were initiated in 96-well plates by co-incubating 1x10 6 CD8+ T cells
with 2x10 5 washed coated beads in 200 pl TCM supplemented with 5 ng/ml IL-12 (Pro
moCell) for 3-4 days at 37'C. Half of the medium was then exchanged by fresh TCM sup
plemented with 80 U/ml IL-2 and incubating was continued for 3-4 days at 37'C. This stimu
lation cycle was performed for a total of three times. For the pMHC multimer readout using 8
different pMHC molecules per condition, a two-dimensional combinatorial coding approach
was used as previously described (Andersen et al., 2012) with minor modifications encom
passing coupling to 5 different fluorochromes. Finally, multimeric analyses were performed
by staining the cells with Live/dead near IR dye (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), CD8
FITC antibody clone SKI (BD, Heidelberg, Germany) and fluorescent pMHC multimers. For
analysis, a BD LSRII SORP cytometer equipped with appropriate lasers and filters was used.
Peptide specific cells were calculated as percentage of total CD8+ cells. Evaluation of multi
meric analysis was done using the FlowJo software (Tree Star, Oregon, USA). In vitro prim
ing of specific multimer+ CD8+ lymphocytes was detected by by comparing to negative con
trol stimulations. Immunogenicity for a given antigen was detected if at least one evaluable in
vitro stimulated well of one healthy donor was found to contain a specific CD8+ T-cell line
after in vitro stimulation (i.e. this well contained at least 1% of specific multimer+ among
CD8+ T-cells and the percentage of specific multimer+ cells was at least 10x the median of
the negative control stimulations).

Syntheses of peptides
All peptides were synthesized using standard and well-established solid phase peptide synthe
sis using the Fmoc-strategy. After purification by preparative RP-HPLC, ion-exchange proce
dure was performed to incorporate physiological compatible counter ions (for example tri
fluoro-acetate, acetate, ammonium or chloride).
Identity and purity of each individual peptide have been determined by mass spectrometry
and analytical RP-HPLC. After ion-exchange procedure the peptides were obtained as white
to off-white lyophilizates in purities of 90% to 99.7%.
All TUMAPs are preferably administered as trifluoro-acetate salts or acetate salts, other salt
forms are also possible. For the measurements of example 4, trifluoro-acetate salts of the pep
tides were used.

cleaved upon UV-irradiation, and exchanged with the peptide of interest as analyzed. Only
peptide candidates that can effectively bind and stabilize the peptide-receptive MHC mole
cules prevent dissociation of the MHC complexes. To determine the yield of the exchange
reaction, an ELISA was performed based on the detection of the light chain (02m) of stabi
lized MHC complexes. The assay was performed as generally described in Rodenko et al.

Candidate peptides that show a high exchange yield (i.e. higher than 40%, preferably higher
than 50%, more preferred higher than 70%, and most preferred higher than 80%) are general
ly preferred for a generation and production of antibodies or fragments thereof, and/or T cell
receptors or fragments thereof, as they show sufficient avidity to the MHC molecules and
prevent dissociation of the MHC complexes.
EXAMPLE 7
Binding and immunogenicity of selected MHC class II peptides
HLA class II proteins are divided into 3 major isotypes HLA-DR, -DP, DQ which are encod
ed by numerous haplotypes. The combination of various a- and B- chains increases the diver
sity of the HLA class II proteins found in an arbitrary population. Thus, the selected HLA class
II TUMAPs have to bind to several different HLA-DR molecules (i.e. show promiscuous bind
ing ability) in order to be able to contribute to an effective T-cell response in a significant
percentage of patients.
The promiscuous binding of POSTN-002 and MMP12-002 to various HLA-DR haplotypes
and the stability of the formed complexes was assessed in an in vitro binding assay by an ex
ternal service provider as follows.

Principle of Test
The ProImmune REVEAL* MHC-peptide binding assay determines the ability of each candi
date peptide to bind to the selected HLA class II haplotype and stabilize the HLA-peptide
complex. Thereby the candidate peptides are assembled in vitro with a particular HLA class II
protein. The level of peptide incorporation into HLA molecules is measured by presence or
absence of the native conformation of the assembled HLA-peptide complex at time 0 after
completed refolding procedure (so called on-rate).
The binding capacity of candidate peptide to a particular HLA molecule is compared to the
one with known very strong binding properties (positive control) resulting in the correspond
ing REVEAL* MHC-peptide binding score. The positive control peptide is selected and pro
vided by ProImmune based on their experience individually for each HLA haplotype.

 WO 2015/018805                                                             PCT/EP2014/066755

Besides the affinity of a peptide to a particular HLA molecule, the enduring stability of the
formed HLA-peptide complex is crucial for the occurrence of an immune response. Accord
ingly presence of the formed HLA-peptide complex is measured after its incubation for 24 h
at 37'C. Consequently the stability of the formed MHC-peptide complex is calculated as a
ration of the binding scores at 24 h and the binding scores which are received right after the
refolding (accordingly at time 0) in percent.
Results
The analysis of POSTN-002 and MMP12-002 in REVEAL MHC-peptide binding assay
showed that both peptides bind to various HLA haplotypes. POSTN-002 was shown to form a
complex with 5 and MMP12-002 with 4 of 7 investigated HLA haplotypes (Figure 5). Both
peptides did not bind to HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR6. The detected binding scores were within
the range of 0.02 to about 2.5% compared to the positive control, and clearly above scores of
non-binding peptides.
The stability analysis of the formed HLA-POSTN-002 and HLA-MMP12-002 complexes
revealed that 3 and 2 of 6 investigated HLA-peptide complexes were stable after 24 h at 37'C,
respectively (Figure 6).
A conclusion on the immugenicity of a peptide based on its binding capacity to a HLA
molecule can be made by comparing the binding score of this peptide to the one with known
immunogenicity. Therefore, five well investigated peptides with determined immunogenicity
were selected for this comparison. The immunogenicity of these peptides was determined ex
vivo in blood samples of vaccinated patients using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) CD4
T-cells.
In principle, ICS assays analyze the quality of specific T cells in terms of effector functions.
Therefore, the peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultivated in vitro and
subsequently restimulated by the peptide of interest, a reference peptide and a negative
control (here MOCK). Following the restimulated cells were stained for FN-gamma, TNF
alpha, IL-2 and IL-10 production, as well as expression of the co-stimulatory molecule
CD 154. The counting of affected cells was performed on a flow cytometer (Figure 7).
The immunogenicity analysis revealed 100% immune response by vaccination with IMA950
peptides (BIR-002 and MET-005) in 16 patients and 44% to 86% immune response by
vaccinaton with IMA910 peptides (CEA-006, TGFBI-004 and MMP-001) in 71 patients.
To compare the binding scores of POSTN-002 and MMP12-002 to the binding scores of
IMA910 and IMA950 peptides, all peptides were arranged in a table for each investigated
HLA-DR haplotype according to the detected binding score (Tables 8.1 to 8.5).

002 are highlighted in gray.

The comparison of the binding scores of POSTN-002 and MMP12-002 to the binding scores
of the other class II peptides with known immunogenicity showed that the binding capacities
of both peptides are mostly located in the middle till the lower half of the tables with excep
tion of HLA-DR2. The binding capacities of both peptides to HLA-DR2 are located in the
upper half of the table with MMP12-002 being the top candidate. Based on this analysis it
must be expected that both peptides, POSTN-002 and MMP12-002, induce an immune re
sponse as well.
