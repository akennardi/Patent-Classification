                            This application                is a divisional application      derived from
   Australian Patent Application No. <removed-apn> (which is itself a divisional

                                                           BACKGROUND
                                 The present invention relates generally to handheld power
   tools, and specifically to fastener driving tools, including, but not limited to
   combustion-powered fastener-driving tools, also referred to as combustion
10 tools or combustion nailers, as well as pneumatic nailers and electric nailers
   employing reciprocating driver blades and magazine feeders.
                            Combustion-powered tools are known in the art, and one type of
   such tools, also known as IMPULSE@ brand tools for use in driving
   fasteners into workpieces, is described in commonly assigned patents to
15 Nikolich U.S. Pat. Re. No. 32,452, and U.S.                                      Pat. Nos. 4,522,162;

   7,341,171, all of which are incorporated by reference herein.                                     Similar
   combustion-powered                                 nail  and   staple   driving   tools  are    available
   commercially from ITW-Paslode of Vernon Hills, Illinois under the
20 IMPULSE@, BUILDEX® and PASLODE@ brands.
                            Such tools incorporate a tool housing enclosing a small internal
   combustion engine. The engine is powered by a canister of pressurized fuel
   gas, also called a fuel cell. A battery-powered

WO 2012/068007                                                         PCT/US2011/060577
          electronic power distribution unit produces a spark for ignition, and a
          fan located in a combustion chamber provides for both an efficient
          combustion within the chamber, while facilitating processes ancillary to
          the combustion operation of the device.           The engine includes a
     5    reciprocating piston with an elongated, rigid driver blade disposed
          within a single cylinder body. Fasteners are fed magazine-style into the
          nosepiece, where they are held in a properly positioned orientation for
          receiving the impact of the driver blade.
                          When the user depresses the tool against a workpiece, the
    10    tool closes the combustion chamber and fuel is delivered into the
          combustion chamber, after fuel/air mixing, the user activates the
          trigger, initiating a spark with the ignition spark unit, then the burnt gas
          generates a high pressure to push the piston down and drive the nail.
          Just prior to the piston impacting the bumper, the piston passes through
    15    the exhaust port, and some of the gas is exhaust.          The combustion
          chamber generates vacuum pressure to retract the piston back to the
          pre-firing position.    Simultaneously, the fastener feeding mechanism
          feeds the next fastener into a pre-driving position in the nosepiece or
          nose (the terms are considered interchangeable).          However, due to
    20    friction caused by the feeding mechanism urging fasteners against the
          driver blade, the return of the piston is slowed or even stopped.
                          More specifically, once the nail driving process is
          complete, a subsequent timing relationship between the return of the
          drive piston and advancement of the feeder mechanism is also
    25    important to obtain reliable piston return and nail feeding.            The
          preferred timing scenario is for the drive piston to return to the pre
                                                2

          firing position before the feeder mechanism advances the nail into the
          tool nosepiece. In conventional nailers, the feeder mechanism attempts
          to advance the nail into the nose while the drive piston and driver blade
          is returning to the pre-firing position.    This results in the nail being
     5    biased against the driver blade during the return cycle. Only when the
          driver blade is fully retracted to its pre-firing position and a clear
          fastener passageway is provided does the fastener reach its drive
          position.

                                          SUMMARY
                         The above-listed drawbacks of conventional nailers are
          met or exceeded by the present tool, featuring a mechanism for
          delaying the fastener advance of the second and subsequent fasteners
    15    until after the piston has returned to the pre-firing position after driving
          a leading fastener.    The present fastener delay can be accomplished
          mechanically or electromechanically. When operated mechanically, the
          fastener delay mechanism is activated directly by the position of the
          driver blade. When operated electromechanically, the fastener delay
    20    mechanism is energized or actuated for a specified period of time or
          until the position of the piston or driver blade activates a position
          switch.    After prolonged use, when combustion-powered, the tool
          commonly heats up, which slows piston return even more than when
          the tool is first used.     An advantage of the present fastener delay
    25    mechanism is that the fastener is delayed a sufficient period of time
          regardless of tool temperature.

                         Another     advantage    of   the  present   fastener delay
          mechanism occurs when applied to tools requiring a strong biasing
          force for fastener advancement, typically using a feed pawl or claw
          member to feed the fastener, which causes significant friction force
     5    between the fastener and the driver blade. Such fastener drive systems
          are disclosed in commonly-assigned US Patent Application Serial No.
          11/820,942, published as US Patent Application Publication No. 2008
          0314953-Al, incorporated by reference herein.          The present system
          reduces the friction applied to the driver blade, facilitating a rapid
    10    return to the pre-firing position.
                         More specifically, a nailer includes a power source
          including a piston reciprocating within a cylinder, a driver blade
          secured to the piston for common movement relative to a nosepiece, a
          magazine connected to the nosepiece for feeding fasteners sequentially
    15    for being driven into a workpiece by the driver blade, a fastener delay
          mechanism operatively associated with the magazine and configured
          for engaging a subsequent fastener and delaying advancement of the
          subsequent fastener or fasteners to the nosepiece until the driver blade
          returns to the pre-firing position after driving a leading fastener.

                                 DETAILED DESCRIPTION
                         Referring now to FIGs. 1 and 2, a fastener-driving tool of
          the type suitable with the present feeder mechanism is generally
          designated 10 and is depicted as a combustion-powered tool.          The
    20    general principles of operation of such tools are known in the art and
          are described in US Patent Nos. 5,197,646; 4,522,162; 4,483,473;
          4,483,474 and 4,403,722, all of which are incorporated by reference.
          However, it is contemplated that the present fastener delay mechanism
          is applicable to fastener driving tools powered by other power sources
    25    that employ a reciprocating driver blade for driving magazine-fed
                                                5

WO 2012/068007                                                         PCT/US2011/060577
          fasteners into a workpiece, including but not limited to electrically,
          pneumatically or powder driven nailers.        Also, while it should be
          understood that the tool 10 is operable in a variety of orientations,
          directional terms such as "upper" and "lower" refer to the tool in the
     5    orientation depicted in FIG. 2.
                         A housing 12 of the tool 10 encloses a self-contained
          internal power source 14 within a housing main chamber 16.           As in
          conventional combustion tools, the power source 14 is powered by
          internal combustion and includes a combustion chamber 18 (FIG. 2)
    10    that communicates with a drive cylinder 20.            A drive piston 22
          reciprocally disposed within the drive cylinder 20 is connected to the
          upper end of a driver blade 24. As is well known in the art, the piston
          22 is connected to and moves with the driver blade 24. As such, in the
          present application, discussion of the position of the piston 22 will be
    15    understood to include the driver blade 24 and vice versa. An upper
          limit of the reciprocal travel of the drive piston 22 is referred to as a
          pre-firing position, which occurs just prior to firing, or the ignition of
          the combustion gases that initiates the downward driving of the driver
          blade 24 to impact a fastener 26 (FIG. 3) to drive it into a workpiece.
    20                   Through depression of a trigger 28, an operator induces
          ignition and a resulting combustion within the combustion chamber 18,
          causing the driver blade 24 to be forcefully driven downward through a
          nose or nosepiece 30. The nosepiece 30 guides the driver blade 24 to
          strike a first or forward-most fastener 26a (FIG. 3) that had been
    25    delivered into the nosepiece via a fastener magazine 32.          While a
          variety of magazines are contemplated as are known in the art,
                                              6

WO 2012/068007                                                       PCT/US2011/060577
          including strip and rotary types, in the present tool 10 the magazine 32
          is preferably a linear or strip magazine in which the fasteners 26 are
          secured in a strip 34 using collating materials, typically metal, paper or
          plastic.
     5                   In proximity to the nosepiece 30 is a workpiece contact
          element 36, which is connected, through a linkage or upper probe 38 to
          a reciprocating valve sleeve 40, which partially defines the combustion
          chamber 18. Depression of the tool housing 12 towards the workpiece
          (not shown) in a downward direction in relation to the depiction in
    10    FIG. 2, causes the workpiece contact element 36 to move from a rest
          position to a firing position, closing the combustion chamber 18 and
          preparing it for combustion.     Other pre-firing functions, such as the
          energization of a fan 42 in the combustion chamber 18 powered by a
          fan motor 44, and/or the delivery of a dose of fuel from a fuel cell 46
    15    located in a fuel cell chamber 48 in the housing 12 to the combustion
          chamber 18 are performed mechanically or under the control of a
          control circuit or program 50 embodied in a central processing unit or
          control module 52 (shown hidden), typically housed in a handle portion
          54 (FIG. 1) of the housing 12.
    20                   Upon a pulling of the trigger 28, a spark plug 56 is
          energized, igniting the fuel and gas mixture in the combustion chamber
          18 and sending the drive piston 22 and the driver blade 24 downward
          toward the waiting leading fastener 26a for entry into the workpiece.
          While in the present application the leading fastener 26a is first in line
    25    and is the next fastener to be driven, it is contemplated that other
          selected fasteners could be designated the leading fastener depending
                                               7

WO 2012/068007                                                        PCT/US2011/060577
          on the configuration of the tool 10. The subsequent bottoming out of
          the piston 22 and return, and the exhaust, clearing and other functions
          of the tool 10 are well known in the art and discussed in the patents
          incorporated by reference, and need not be addressed here.
     5                   Referring now to FIGs. 3 and 4, a main feature of the
          present tool 10 is a fastener delay system or mechanism, generally
          designated    60.    An electro-magnetic      solenoid   62 including     a
          reciprocating plunger 64 is mounted to the tool 10, such as to the
          magazine 32, to be at an angle and preferably perpendicular to the strip
    10    34 of fasteners 26. It is contemplated that the angle of orientation of the
          solenoid 62 relative to the fasteners 26 may vary to suit the situation.
          Also, while the mounting position of the solenoid 62 on the tool 10 may
          vary to suit the situation, in the preferred embodiment, the solenoid is
          mounted to engage the strip 34 between the leading and a subsequent
    15    fastener, respectively designated 26a, 26b. It is not required that the
          solenoid 62 be located between the leading and subsequent fasteners in
          the magazine, or those located closest to the nosepiece 30. As is known
          in the art, the magazine 32 is provided with a magazine follower 66
          (FIG. 1) which urges the strip 34 in the direction of the arrow A
    20    towards the nosepiece 30.
                         The solenoid 62 is electrically        connected to, and
          controlled by, the control program 50 as is known in the art. The
          plunger 64 reciprocates between a retracted position and an extended
          position (FIG. 4).     In this application, it will be understood that
    25    "retracted" and "extended" refer to the position of the plunger 64 as it is
          disposed for respectively allowing the passage of, or blocking the
                                               8

WO 2012/068007                                                        PCT/US2011/060577
          passage of fasteners 26 towards the nosepiece 30. Various mechanical
          assemblies are contemplated for achieving these functions.         In the
          retracted position, the fasteners 26 are free to move toward the
          nosepiece 30 through urging of the biased follower 66, as in standard
     5    nailer operation. In the extended position, the first fastener 26a may be
          driven by the driver blade 24, but the second fastener 26b and the
          remainder of the strip 34 is prevented from movement towards the
          nosepiece 30.      The control program 50 is configured so that the
          solenoid 62 is energized or activated to move the plunger 64 to the
    10    extended position for a specified period of time. While the duration of
          the period may vary to suit the circumstances, it is preferred that the
          solenoid be energized for approximately 100 milliseconds (msec),
          considered sufficient time for the piston 22 to return to the pre-firing
          position (FIG.2).
    15                   Two control mechanisms can be used on the control of
          the solenoid 62: a timing delay control system as shown in FIG. 5, and
          a piston position signal control as described in FIG. 6.
                         Referring now to FIG. 5, a timing chart is schematically
          shown indicating the cooperation of the control program 50 and the
    20    present fastener delay mechanism 60. At time ti, a spark is initiated at
          the spark plug 56 by the user pulling the trigger 28 as is known in the
          art. There is a small program delay between pulling the trigger 28 and
          the    actual initial  spark generation,    as   is known     in the  art.
          Simultaneously with the spark generation, the control program 50
    25    initiates an electromagnetic timer function 68 which is a clock set for a
          preset period, preferably approximately 100 msec, which may vary to
                                               9

WO 2012/068007                                                        PCT/US2011/060577
          suit the situation.    The timer 68 indicates the energization of the
          solenoid plunger 64 into the extended position.
                         Due to the initial delay, the combustion does not occur
          until t2, when the piston 22 begins traveling down the cylinder 20, and
     5    the driver blade 24 impacts the first fastener 26a. The fastener pre
          drive position on the timing chart reflects the position of the next to be
          driven fastener 26b.     At t3, the first fastener 26a is driven by the
          descending driver blade 24. After that, there is no fastener in the pre
          drive position until after t5, which designates the return of the piston 22
    10    to the pre-firing position. Only at t5 does the timer 68 expire and the
          fastener 26b is again urged toward the nosepiece 30 due to retraction of
          the plunger 64. Thus, there is no frictional loading against the driver
          blade 24 by fasteners 26 as the piston 22 returns to the pre-firing
          position.
    15                   Referring now to FIG. 6, an alternate control system is
          generally designated 70.      Components shared with the system 60 of
          FIG. 5 are designated with identical reference numbers.          The main
          distinguishing feature of the system 70 compared to the system 60 is
          that instead of using a control system-controlled solenoid delay, the
    20    plunger 64 is operated by a piston position sensor 72 located near the
          upper end of the drive cylinder 20 at the piston pre-firing position
          (shown schematically in FIG. 2).       The sensor 72 is contemplated as
          being an opto switch, a magnetic position sensor, or the like.      At ti, a
          spark is initiated by the spark plug 56, sending the piston 22 down the
    25    cylinder at t2. This movement of the piston 22 from the pre-firing
          position activates or energizes the position sensor 72 as seen in FIG. 6.

          Also at t2, the sensor 72 then simultaneously activates the solenoid 62
          to energize the plunger 64 and prevent fastener 26b and those behind it
          from advancing toward the nosepiece 30.          Since there is less friction
          acting on the piston 22 and the driver blade 24, the piston returns
     5    relatively rapidly to the pre-firing position. Once the piston 22 returns
          to the pre-firing position at t3, the sensor 72 is deactivated or turned off,
          and the plunger 64 is immediately retracted, allowing the fasteners 26
          to again move toward the nosepiece 30.
                          Referring   now     to   FIG. 7,    yet   another   alternate
    10    embodiment of the present fastener delay mechanism is generally
          designated 80 and schematically represented. Components shared with
          the systems 60 and 70 are designated with identical reference numbers.
          A main difference between the system 80 and that of the systems 60
          and 70 is that the plunger 64 does not directly act upon or engage the
    15    fasteners 26.    Instead, the plunger activates an interim pivoting cam
          member 82, which pivots about an axis 84 transverse to the direction of
          movement of the fasteners 26. A first cam arm 86 extends from the
          pivot point and engages the fastener 26b when the solenoid 62 is
          energized. A second cam arm 88, preferably projecting at a right angle
    20    to the first cam arm 86, is pivotally connected to the plunger 64 by a pin
          90 disposed parallel to the pivot axis 84. Thus, retraction of the plunger
          64 due to deenergization of the solenoid 62 will pivot the first cam arm
          86 counter-clockwise in an arc B as seen in FIG. 7 and away from the
          fasteners 26. It is contemplated that the system 80 may be operated by
    25    either of the control systems 60 or 70 described above.

WO 2012/068007                                                          PCT/US2011/060577
                         Referring now to FIGs. 8 and 9, still another alternate
          embodiment is generally designated 100 and is referred to as a system
          or mechanism. Components shared with the embodiments 60, 70 and
          80 are designated with identical reference numbers. A main distinction
     5    of the system 100 compared to the other embodiments is that the delay
          mechanism is operated solely mechanically by direct contact with the
          driver blade 24, such that, after ignition, the driver blade moving
          toward the fasteners 26 activates the delay system 100, which remains
          activated until the driver blade is retracted to the pre-firing position. As
    10    such, there is no electronic or electromechanical control over the system
          100.
                         More specifically, the system 100 includes a generally
          wedge-shaped or lobed cam 102 connected to the tool 10 and pivoting
          about a transverse pivot axis 104 parallel to the axis 84 described in
    15    relation to FIG. 7. Also, the pivot axis 104 is disposed in an offset
          location on the cam 102. The cam 102 includes a first surface 106 and
          a second surface 108. As can be seen in FIGs. 8 and 9, the first and
          second surfaces 106, 108 form a common angle. A biasing element 110
          such as a spring is connected to the first surface 106 to bias it towards
    20    the driver blade 24. Thus, the cam 102 is biased into a path of the
          driver blade 24, and the first surface 106 engages the driver blade.
                         The second surface 108 is in contact with a biased feed
          pawl 112 which reciprocates between a retracted position in which it
          does not engage the fasteners 26 (FIG. 8), and an extended position in
    25    which it engages the fastener 26b (FIG. 9).          The feed pawl 112 is
          connected to the tool 10 using a variety of connection technologies, for
                                                12

WO 2012/068007                                                          PCT/US2011/060577
          example, as being pivotable about an axis (not shown) parallel to the
          direction of movement of the fastener strip 34. A biasing element 114
          such as a spring is connected to the pawl 112 to bias it away from the
          fastener strip 34, or to the retracted position of FIG. 8.
     5                   Referring now to FIG. 9, as the driver blade 24 progresses
          toward the fastener 26a, the driver blade engages the first surface 106
          and overcomes the biasing effect of the biasing element 110, causing
          the cam 102 to rotate about the axis 104 in the clockwise direction as
          shown. This rotation of the cam 102 causes the second surface 108 to
    10    engage the feed pawl 112 and to overcome the biasing force of the
          biasing element 114 so that the feed pawl moves to the extended
          position in which it blocks the fastener 26b, prevents further fastener
          advancement until the pawl is released, and reduces loading on the
          reciprocating driver blade 24, permitting more rapid return of the piston
    15    22. The feed pawl 112 is released only when the driver blade 24 is
          sufficiently retracted to clear the first cam surface 106, which also
          occurs when the piston 22 reaches the pre-firing position.
                         While particular embodiments of the present fastener
          advance delay for a fastener driving tool have been described herein, it
    20    will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes and
          modifications may be made thereto without departing from the
          invention in its broader aspects and as set forth in the following claims.
