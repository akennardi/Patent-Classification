   Detailed Description
   Referring to the drawings, there is shown a gaming system
   having a game controller arranged to implement a game
35 having a series of game rounds wherein special symbols,
   such as wild symbols, are controlled such that they are
   displayed at one or more display positions and the number
   of special symbols increases during the series of game
                                           9957903_1 (GHKatters) P77298.AU.4

                             - 11
   rounds. In an embodiment, the special symbols move from
   reel to reel.
   The gaming system may take a number of different forms. In
 5 a first form of the single player component of the
   invention, a stand alone gaming machine is provided
   wherein all or most components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine.
10 In a second form, a distributed architecture is provided
   wherein some of the components required for implementing
   the game are present in a player operable gaming machine
   and some of the components required for implementing the
   game are located remotely relative to the gaming machine.
15 For example, a "thick client" architecture may be used
   wherein part of the game is executed on a player operable
   gaming machine and part of the game is executed remotely,
   such as by a gaming server; or a "thin client"
   architecture may be used wherein most of the game is
20 executed remotely such as by a gaming server and a player
   operable gaming machine is used only to display audible
   and/or visible gaming information to the player and
   receive gaming inputs from the player.
25 However, it will be understood that other arrangements are
   envisaged.  For example, an architecture may be provided
   wherein a gaming machine is networked to a gaming server
   and the respective functions of the gaming machine and the
   gaming server are selectively modifiable.      For example,
30 the gaming system may operate in stand alone gaming
   machine mode, "thick client" mode or "thin client" mode
   depending on the game being played, operating conditions,
   and so on. Other variations will be apparent to persons
   skilled in the art.
35
   Irrespective of the form, the gaming system comprises
   several core components. At the broadest level, the core
   components are a player interface 50 and a game controller
                                           9957903_1 (GHKatters) P77298.AU.4

                              - 12
   60 as illustrated in Figure 1. The player interface is
   arranged to enable manual interaction between a player and
   the gaming system and for this purpose includes the
   input/output components required for the player to enter
 5 instructions and play the game.
   Components of the player interface may vary from
   embodiment to embodiment but will typically include a
   credit mechanism 52 to enable a player to input credits
10 and receive payouts, one or more displays 54, a game play
   mechanism 56 comprising one or more input devices that
   enable a player to input game play instructions           (e.g. to
   place bets),  and one or more speakers 58.
15 The game controller 60 is in data communication with the
   player interface and typically includes a processor 62
   that processes the game play instructions in accordance
   with game play rules and outputs game play outcomes to the
   display. Typically, the game play instructions are stored
20 as program code in a memory 64 but can also be hardwired.
   Herein the term "processor" is used to refer generically
   to any device that can process game play instructions in
   accordance with game play rules and may include:            a
   microprocessor, microcontroller, programmable logic device
25 or other computational device, a general purpose computer
    (e.g. a PC) or a server.
   A gaming system in the form of a stand alone gaming
   machine 10 is illustrated in Figure 2. The gaming machine
30 10 includes a console 12 having a display 14 on which are
   displayed representations of a game 16 that can be played
   by a player.   A mid-trim 20 of the gaming machine 10
   houses a bank of buttons 22 for enabling a player to
   interact with the gaming machine, in particular during
35 game play.   The mid-trim 20 also houses a credit input
   mechanism 24 which in this example includes a coin input
   chute 24A and a bill collector 24B.   Other credit input
   mechanisms may also be employed, for example, a card
                                            9957903_1 (GHKatters) P77298.AU.4

   reader for reading a smart card, debit card or credit
   card.   A player marketing module  (not shown) having a
   reading device may also be provided for the purpose of
   reading a player tracking device, for example as part of a
 5 loyalty program.   The player tracking device may be in the
   form of a card, flash drive or any other portable storage
   medium capable of being read by the reading device.
   A top box 26 may carry artwork 28, including for example
10 pay tables and details of bonus awards and other
   information or images relating to the game.          Further
   artwork and/or information may be provided on a front
   panel 29 of the console 12.    A coin tray 30 is mounted
   beneath the front panel 29 for dispensing cash payouts
15 from the gaming machine 10.
   The display 14 shown in Figure 2 is in the form of a video
   display unit, particularly a cathode ray tube screen
   device.   Alternatively, the display 14 may be a liquid
20 crystal display, plasma screen, any other suitable video
   display unit, or the visible portion of an
   electromechanical device.    The top box 26 may also include
   a display, for example a video display unit, which may be
   of the same type as the display 14, or of a different
25 type.

   The gaming machine 100 includes a game controller 101
   having a processor 102.   Instructions and data to control
   operation of the processor 102 are stored in a memory 103,
   which is in data communication with the processor 102.
35 Typically, the gaming machine 100 will include both
   volatile and non-volatile memory and more than one of each
   type of memory, with such memories being collectively
   represented by the memory 103.
                                             9957903_1 (GHKatters) P77298.AU.4

                             - 14
   The gaming machine has hardware meters 104 for purposes
   including ensuring regulatory compliance and monitoring
   player credit, an input/output (I/0) interface 105 for
 5 communicating with peripheral devices of the gaming
   machine 100.  The input/output interface 105 and/or the
   peripheral devices may be intelligent devices with their
   own memory for storing associated instructions and data
   for use with the input/output interface or the peripheral
10 devices.  A random number generator module 113 generates
   random numbers for use by the processor 102.         Persons
   skilled in the art will appreciate that the reference to
   random numbers includes pseudo-random numbers.
15 In the example shown in Figure 3, a player interface 120
   includes peripheral devices that communicate with the game
   controller 101 comprise one or more displays 106, a touch
   screen and/or buttons 107, a card and/or ticket reader
   108, a printer 109, a bill acceptor and/or coin input
20 mechanism 110 and a coin output mechanism 111.          Additional
   hardware may be included as part of the gaming machine
   100, or hardware may be omitted as required for the
   specific implementation. For example, while buttons or
   touch screens are typically used in gaming machines to
25 allow a player to place a wager and initiate a play of a
   game any input device that enables the player to input
   game play instructions may be used. For example, in some
   gaming machines a mechanical handle is used to initiate a
   play of the game.
30
   In addition, the gaming machine 100 may include a
   communications interface, for example a network card 112.
   The network card may, for example, send status
   information, accounting information or other information
35 to a central controller, server or database and receive
   data or commands from the central controller, server or
   database.
                                           9957903_1 (GHKatters) P77298.AU.4

   Figure 4 shows a block diagram of the main components of
   an exemplary memory 103.  The memory 103 includes RAM
   103A, EPROM 103B and a mass storage device 103C.             The RAM
   103A typically temporarily holds program files for
 5 execution by the processor 102 and related data.             The
   EPROM 103B may be a boot ROM device and/or may contain
   some system or game related code.  The mass storage device
   103C is typically used to store game programs, the
   integrity of which may be verified and/or authenticated by
10 the processor 102 using protected code from the EPROM 103B
   or elsewhere.
   It is also possible for the operative components of the
   gaming machine 100 to be distributed, for example
15 input/output devices 106,107,108,109,110,111 to be
   provided remotely from the game controller 101.
   Figure 5 shows a gaming system 200 in accordance with an
   alternative embodiment.  The gaming system 200 includes a
20 network 201, which for example may be an Ethernet network.
   Gaming machines 202, shown arranged in three banks 203 of
   two gaming machines 202 in Figure 5, are connected to the
   network 201.  The gaming machines 202 provide a player
   operable interface and may be the same as the gaming
25 machines 10,100 shown in Figures 2 and 3, or may have
   simplified functionality depending on the requirements for
   implementing game play.  While banks 203 of two gaming
   machines are illustrated in Figure 5, banks of one, three
   or more gaming machines are also envisaged.
30
   One or more displays 204 may also be connected to the
   network 201.  For example, the displays 204 may be
   associated with one or more banks 203 of gaming machines.
   The displays 204 may be used to display representations
35 associated with game play on the gaming machines 202,
   and/or used to display other representations, for example
   promotional or informational material.
                                           9957903_1 (GHKatters) P77298.AU.4

   In a thick client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   part of the game played by a player using a gaming machine
   202 and the gaming machine 202 implements part of the
   game. With this embodiment, as both the game server and
 5 the gaming device implement part of the game, they
   collectively provide a game controller. A database
   management server 206 may manage storage of game programs
   and associated data for downloading or access by the
   gaming devices 202 in a database 206A. Typically, if the
10 gaming system enables players to participate in a Jackpot
   game, a Jackpot server 207 will be provided to perform
   accounting functions for the Jackpot game.       A loyalty
   program server 212 may also be provided.
15 In a thin client embodiment, game server 205 implements
   most or all of the game played by a player using a gaming
   machine 202 and the gaming machine 202 essentially
   provides only the player interface.  With this embodiment,
   the game server 205 provides the game controller. The
20 gaming machine will receive player instructions, pass
   these to the game server which will process them and
   return game play outcomes to the gaming machine for
   display.  In a thin client embodiment, the gaming machines
   could be computer terminals, e.g. PCs running software
25 that provides a player interface operable using standard
   computer input and output components. Other client/server
   configurations are possible, and further details of a
   client/server architecture can be found in WO 2006/052213
   and PCT/SE2006/000559, the disclosures of which are
30 incorporated herein by reference.
   Servers are also typically provided to assist in the
   administration of the gaming network 200, including for
   example a gaming floor management server 208, and a
35 licensing server 209 to monitor the use of licenses
   relating to particular games.  An administrator terminal
   210 is provided to allow an administrator to run the
   network 201 and the devices connected to the network.
                                           9957903_1 (GHKatters) P77298.AU.4

                              - 17
   The gaming system 200 may communicate with other gaming
   systems, other local networks, for example a corporate
   network, and/or a wide area network such as the Internet,
 5 for example through a firewall 211.
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that in
   accordance with known techniques, functionality at the
   server side of the network may be distributed over a
10 plurality of different computers.   For example, elements
   may be run as a single "engine" on one server or a
   separate server may be provided.   For example, the game
   server 205 could run a random generator engine.
   Alternatively, a separate random number generator server
15 could be provided.  Further, persons skilled in the art
   will appreciate that a plurality of games servers could be
   provided to run different games or a single game server
   may run a plurality of different games as required by the
   terminals.
20
   Further detail of exemplar gaming system
   The player operates the game play mechanism 56 to initiate
   a play of the gaming system. The player's operation of the
25 game play mechanism specifies, in part, what will be
   evaluated when the play is conducted and thereby what the
   player is entitled to win from the game. Persons skilled
   in the art will appreciate that a player's win entitlement
   will vary from game to game dependent on player
30 selections. In most spinning reel games, it is typical for
   the player's entitlement to be affected by the amount they
   wager and selections they make  (i.e. the nature of the
   wager). For example, a player's win entitlement may be
   based on how many lines they will play in each game -                 i.e.
35 a minimum of one line up to the maximum number of lines
   allowed by the game  (noting that not all permutations of
   win lines may be available for selection.       Such win lines
   are typically formed by a combination of displayed symbol
                                            9957903_1 (GHKatters) P77298.AU.4

                              - 18
   positions, one from each reel, the symbol positions being
   located relative to one another such that they form a
   line.
 5 In many games, the player's win entitlement is not
   strictly limited to the lines they have selected, for
   example, "scatter" pays are awarded independently of a
   players selection of pay lines and are an inherent part of
   the win entitlement.
10
   Persons skilled in the art, will appreciate that in other
   embodiments, the player may obtain a win entitlement by
   selecting a number of reels to play. Such games are
   marketed under the trade name "Reel Power" by Aristocrat
15 Leisure Industries Pty Ltd. The selection of the reel
   means that each symbol of the reel can be substituted for
   a symbol at one or more designated display positions. In
   other words, all symbol positions of a selected reel can
   be used to form symbol combinations with designated,
20 displayed symbol positions of other reels.
   In other embodiments a player win entitlement may be
   affected by purchasing access to particular pay tables
   e.g. a first bet amount entitles the player to wins
25 including cherries and a second amount entitles them to
   wins including plums.
   The game controller of the preferred embodiment is shown
   in more detail in Figure 6. Game controller 60
30 incorporates a symbol selector 610 that selects symbols a
   set of symbols  (a display set) 643 from symbol selection
   set 642 using random numbers from random number generator
   650, to appear on the display 54 in a base game. In one
   example, the symbol set corresponds to reels having a
35 defined order and symbol selector determines the stop
   position using the random number generator . For example,
   if there are five reels, each having twenty symbols, the
   stop determining function might determine that the stop
                                            9957903_1 (GHKatters) P77298.AU.4

                              - 19
   positions are positions: 3, 13, 7, 9 and 17. The spinning
   of the reels is then controlled so that each symbol comes
   to a stop in the same row, typically a predetermined row
   of a plurality of rows of symbols. When a reels stops, the
 5 symbols will be in one of a plurality of possible symbol
   positions for that reel relative to the stop position.
   Often, particular stop positions are weighted so as to
   control the probability of certain outcomes. Outcome
   determiner 630 determines whether the selected symbols
10  (stored as symbol display set 643) correspond to a winning
   outcome and updates meter data 646 as appropriate.
   In addition to the above, feature game round controller
   625 is arranged to monitor for a trigger event which may
15 be any of the known triggers in the art, including a
   particular symbol combination, a number of games played or
   an amount wagered in a time period. In another embodiment,
   feature game round controller 625 is operably connected
   with random number generator 650 to randomly determine
20 whether a feature game round should be initiated. Feature
   game round controller in 625 comprises a special symbol
   controller adapted to control the number and display
   position of special symbols from special symbol set 641
   during a series of game rounds conducted feature game
25 round controller 620. While, the special symbol controller
   620 controls the number of special symbols and their
   display positions, the remaining display positions of the
   set of display positions are filled by selecting them in
   the same manner as the base game, so that the special
30 symbols under control of the special symbol controller
   effectively overwrite the selected symbols at the position
   where they are place by the special symbol controller 620.
   Outcome determiner 630 determines an outcome for the game
35 round based on the symbols in symbol display set 643 which
   is formed from the controlled symbols and the selected
   symbols, and updates meter data 646 using any prize data
   645 in each game round.
                                            9957903_1 (GHKatters) P77298.AU.4

                             - 20
   Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that one or
   more of these components could be provided in other ways,
   for example by a dedicated circuit.
 5
   The special symbol controller 620 is arranged to increase
   the number of special symbols at least once during the
   series of game rounds, typically after a predetermined
   number of game rounds. Thus, at least one first game round
10 involves a first number of special symbols and at least
   one second game round involves a second, larger number of
   special symbols. The number of special symbols may be
   varied again during the game rounds either by being
   increased or decreased. In an embodiment, the special
15 symbol controller 620 also controls the position of the
   special symbols in each game round so that they move in a
   desired way.
   As described above, the outcome determiner determines
20 whether to award any prizes after each game round. These
   are initially accrued on a win meter of meter data 646. At
   the conclusion of the series of game rounds ("free
   games"), the accrued amount is transferred to a credit
   meter of credit data. In some embodiments, the player may
25 be offered the chance to gamble the amount on the win
   meter prior to it being transferred to the credit meter.
   As indicated above, the special symbol may be a wild
   symbol but may also be some other symbol which has a
30 particular effect on the game such as a multiplier or a
   symbol which forms part of a trigger combination for
   triggering a further feature or retriggering the series of
   game rounds.
35 In the above embodiment, the symbols other than the
   selected symbols, are selected from the same symbol set in
   the first and second game rounds, however, persons skilled
   in the art will appreciate that they could be selected
                                           9957903_1 (GHKatters) P77298.AU.4

                             - 21
   from different sets of symbols. Put another way, symbols
   could be selected from a first set of symbols in first
   game rounds and a second set in second game rounds, and
   the first and second sets could be the same or different.
 5 In one embodiment, there can be a third set of game rounds
   (or more than three sets of game rounds) where there are
   more special symbols than the second round and symbols can
   be selected from a third set.
10 The method 700 of an embodiment is described with
   reference to Figure 7. Play is started by the player and a
   base game commences 705 during which symbol selector 610
   selects the symbol display set 643 using random numbers
   from random number generator 650 and the display set
15 appears in the display positions on display 54. In a
   spinning reel game, this corresponds to the visible reel
   positions after the spin of the reels. It is determined
   710 whether a series of game rounds is triggered. If it is
   triggered, a counter is initialised 715, specifying that
20 this is the first game round. It is determined 720 whether
   a first designated number of game rounds N has been
   played. If not, the display 54 is controlled to display a
   first number of special symbols and the remaining symbols
   are selected 730 before an outcome is determined 740. The
25 counter is then increased 745.
   When the number of game rounds G is greater than a
   designated number N of game rounds at least one additional
   special symbol is added as described in further detail
30 below. At step 750 it is determined whether a second
   number of game rounds M has been played, where M is
   greater than N and in this embodiment specifies the total
   number of game rounds to be played. If G is less than or
   equal to M, the method proceeds by controlling 755 the
35 display 54 to display a second number of special symbols
   greater than the first number of special symbols,
   selecting the remaining symbols 730 and determining the
   game round outcome. The counter is increased 745 and
                                           9957903_1 (GHKatters) P77298.AU.4

                              - 22
   second game rounds with the second number of special
   symbols continue until G is greater than M and the series
   of game rounds ends 760.
 5 Example 1
   A detailed example of an embodiment of the invention will
   now be described. As shown in Figure 8, the display
   positions of a game of five spinning reels 820a to 820e is
10 shown, with three visible reel positions per reel. Non
   feature game rounds involve determination of a game round
   outcome on the basis of combinations of the symbols              (such
   as shown in Figure 8) along win lines played by the
   player, which may be the centre line in a simple example.
15
   On the trigger, which may be random or on the basis of a
   symbol or combination of symbols in the display positions,
   the series of feature games is initiated. In this example,
   whatever win lines were being evaluated in the base game
20 are evaluated in each game round of the series of game
   rounds. In this example, there are ten game rounds in the
   series and the first five game rounds are played with one
   special symbol before the number of special symbols is
   increased to two. In this example the special symbol is a
25 WILD symbol which can substitute for all other symbols to
   form winning combinations.
   In this example, in the first game round one WILD symbol
   is placed at a random display position of the three reels
30 corresponding to reel 5. In this embodiment, the WILD
   symbol covers and overwrites the symbol which would
   otherwise occupy that display position. A game round spin
   then occurs to select the remaining symbols which are
   evaluated together with the WILD symbol. The timing of the
35 placement of the WILD symbol may be controlled to suit the
   game but in one embodiment is placed while the reels spin
   to add to anticipation.
                                           9957903_1 (GHKatters) P77298.AU.4

                             - 23
   The WILD on reel 5 then disappears. In free game 2, one
   WILD is randomly placed on top of a certain position on
   reel 4 and an outcome is determined.
 5 The WILD on reel 4 disappears. In free game 3, one WILD is
   randomly placed on top of a certain position on reel 3 and
   an outcome is determined.
   The WILD on reel 3 disappears. In free game 4, one WILD is
10 randomly placed on top of a certain position on reel 2 and
   an outcome is determined.
   The WILD on reel 2 disappears. In free game 5, one WILD is
   randomly placed on top of a certain position on reel 1 and
15 an outcome is determined.
   The WILD on reel 1 disappears. In free game 6, two WILD
   are randomly placed on top of a certain position on reel 1
   and an outcome is determined.
20
   The WILD on reel 1 disappears. In free game 7, two WILD is
   randomly placed on top of a certain position on reel 2 and
   an outcome is determined.
25 The WILD on reel 2 disappears. In free game 8, two WILD is
   randomly placed on top of a certain position on reel 3 and
   an outcome is determined.
   The WILD on reel 3 disappears. In free game 9, two WILD is
30 randomly placed on top of a certain position on reel 4 and
   an outcome is determined.
   The WILD on reel 4 disappears. In free game 10, two WILD
   is randomly placed on top of a certain position on reel 5,
35 an outcome is determined, and the series of free games
   ends.
