                This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/671,406, filed July 13, 2012, which
   is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
10                                                   Background of the Invention
                In general, this invention relates to DNA-encoded libraries of compounds and methods of using and
   creating such libraries. The invention also relates to compositions for use in such libraries.
                DNA-encoded combinatorial libraries afford many benefits for drug discovery. These libraries can provide
   a large number of diverse compounds that can be rapidly screened and interrogated. To further increase complexity,
15 various steps of the discovery process can be programmed and automated. These steps include the use of multi-step,
   split-and-pool synthesis to add building blocks to atomic or polyatomic scaffolds and the use of enzymatic and/or
   chemical ligation to add oligonucleotide tags that encode both the synthetic steps and the building blocks.
                Despite these benefits, numerous issues can arise when very large or complex libraries must be synthesized
   and deconvoluted. As the size of the library increases, improved methods may be needed to provide high yields of
20 encoding oligonucleotide tag ligation using robust and rapid methodologies. To create libraries under diverse
   reaction conditions, stable oligonucleotide constructs would be beneficial, such as constructs that are stable under
   conditions of high pH and elevated temperature. To simplify deconvolution of tags, the sequence of the tags could
   be recognized by DNA- or RNA-dependent polymerases, such that tag population demographics can be determined
   by template-dependent polymerization and sequence determination. Difficulties may arise when creating a library
25 having all of these beneficial attributes. Accordingly, there exists a need for improved, more robust methods of
   screening and identifying small compounds in oligonucleotide-encoded libraries.
                                                      Summary of the Invention
                The present invention features complexes for use in DNA-encoded libraries, where these complexes have
30 one or more linkages for which a polymerase has reduced ability to read or translocate through. In order to discover
   the identity of encoded regions (e.g., headpience, one or more tags, and/or tailpiece), the linkage is either reversed
   before it is exposed to the polymerase or alternatively bypassed by the polymerase. This linkage can be bypassed in
   any useful manner that may not capture all of the sequence information of the tags (e.g., such as in the 5'- or 3'
   connectors, as described herein) but captures the encoding sequence information of the tags. Such linkages could
35 result in lower incidences of mis-tagging, expand the number and kind of linkages to be used in making complexes
   and libraries, and provide non-enzymatic methods for creating and screening DNA-encoded complexes. Additional
   advantages of these complexes and methods are described herein.
                Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention features a complex including: a chemical entity including one or
   more scaffolds or one or more building blocks; a first oligonucleotide tag encoding the identity of at least one of the
40 one or more scaffolds or building blocks; and a headpiece having a first functional group and a second functional
   group, where the first functional group operatively associates with the chemical entity and the second functional
                                                                  1

   group operatively associates with the first tag via a first linkage for which a polymerase has reduced ability to read
   or translocate through.
               In another aspect, the invention features a complex including: a chemical entity including one or more
   scaffolds or one or more building blocks; n number of oligonucleotide tags having n-1 linkages, where n is an
 5 integer between 1 and about 10, and where each of the linkages is between two adjacent tags and each tag encodes
   the identity of at least one of the one or more scaffolds or building blocks; and a headpiece having a first functional
   group operatively associated with the chemical entity and a second functional group operatively associated with at
   least one of the n number of tags via a first linkage, where a polymerase has reduced ability to read or translocate
   through at least one of the first linkage and n-1 linkages.

                In any of the methods described herein, the method results in any of the complexes described herein or any
   of the libraries described herein.
 5              In yet another aspect, the invention features a method of screening a plurality of chemical entities, the
   method including: (a) contacting a target with any complex described herein and/or a library described herein; and
   (b) selecting one or more complexes having a predetermined characteristic for the target, as compared to a control,
   thereby screening the chemical entity.
                  In some embodiments, the predetermined characteristic includes increased binding for the target (e.g., a
10 biological target, as described herein), as compared to a control.
                In some embodiments, prior to step (a) one or more operations are performed selected from the list
   consisting of: annealing one or more relay primers with said complex, wherein said one or more relay primers span
   said first linkage and/or n-1 linkages; extending said relay primers using a polymerase to produce oligonucleotide
   fragments; and ligating said oligonucleotide fragments to produce a template.

   described herein, the method including: (a) annealing one or more relay primers with the complex, where the one or
   more relay primers span the first linkage and/or n-1 linkages; (b) extending the relay primers using a polymerase to

   amplifying the template by polymerase chain reaction to produce an amplified mix; and (e) sequencing the
20 optionally amplified mix to determine the sequence of the complex.
                  In some embodiments, the complex includes a 5'-connector at the 5'-terminus of one or more tags and a
   3'-connector at the 3'-terminus of one or more tags, and where each of the one or more relay primers hybridizes to
   adjacent 5'- and 3'-connectors. In particular embodiments, each 5'-connector includes the same sequence, and/or
   each 3'-connector includes the same sequence. In some embodiments, the sequence of at least one of the 5'
25 connector is complementary to the sequence of the adjacent 3'-connector (e.g., to form a duplex between the 5'- and
   3'-connectors under hybridization conditions) or identical or sufficiently similar to allow for hybridization to a
   complementary oligonucleotide. In further embodiments, the method includes hybridizing the 5'-connecter to the
   adjacent 3'-connector. In some embodiments, each relay primer for a specific junction (e.g., thereby forming a
   three-helix junction) between the 5'- and 3'-connectors includes the same sequence.
30              In another aspect, the invention features a method of determining the nucleotide sequence of any complex
   described herein, the method including: (a) providing the complex including the chemical linkage, where the
   chemical linkage is a cross-linking oligonucleotide that spans the junction between two adjacent tags and that
   operatively associates with the two adjacent tags via one or more reversible co-reactive groups; (b) releasing the

                In further embodiments, the method includes ligating the tags using a chemical process or an enzymatic
   process (e.g., 5'-phosphorylation) prior to step (b).
40              In some embodiments, the method further includes repairing the template prior to the optional amplifying
   step or the sequencing step. In particular embodiments, the repairing step includes modifying at least one of the first

   linkage and/or n-1 linkages to be a repaired linkage capable of being read or translocated through by a polymerase.
   In some embodiments, the polymerase can read or translocate through at least 50% (e.g., at least 60%, 65%, 70%,
   75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or even 100%) of the repaired linkages (e.g., as compared to a
   control, such as a control oligonucleotide having the first linkage and n-1 linkages that have not been repaired). In
 5 particular embodiments, the polymerase can read or translocate through about 10% to about 100% of the repaired
   linkages (e.g., 20% to 100%, 25% to 100%, 50% to 100%, 75% to 100%, 90% to 100%, 95% to 100%, 10% to 95%,

   90%, and 75% to 90%, as compared to control (e.g., as compared to a control oligonucleotide having the first
   linkage and n-1 linkages that have not been repaired)). In particular embodiments, the repairing step includes
10 providing the template with a repair enzyme (e.g., a photolyase, a glycosylase, an endonuclease, a Flap
   endonuclease, an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease, a poly ADP ribose polymerase, or a methyltransferase,
   as described herein).
                In any of the above embodiments, the methods or complexes may include only single-stranded molecules,
   where the headpiece, the first tag, and/or the one or more additional tags are single-stranded.
15              In any of the above embodiments, the method further comprises one or more optional steps to diversify the
   library or to interrogate the members of the library, as described herein. In some embodiments, the method further
   comprises identifying a small drug-like library member that binds or inactivates a protein of therapeutic interest. In
   other embodiments, the method further comprises contacting a member of the library with a biological target under
   conditions suitable for at least one member of the library to bind to the target, removing one or more library
20 members that do not bind to the target, and analyzing the one or more oligonucleotide tags associated with the
   target.
                As described herein, the use of single-stranded molecules could have numerous benefits. Accordingly, in
   any of the embodiments described herein, the methods and complexes include a headpiece, one or more tags, a
   complex, a chemical entity, a molecule, or any member of a tagged library having decreased mass, increased
25 solubility (e.g., in an organic solvent), decreased cost, increased reactivity, increased target accessibility, decreased
   hydrodynamic radius, and/or increased accuracy of analytical assessments, as compared to a method including one
   or more double-stranded molecules (e.g., a double-stranded headpiece or a double-stranded tag). In some
   embodiments, each of the tags within a set of tags (e.g., the first tag or a subsequent tag, if present) has about the
   same mass (e.g., each tag has a mass that is about +/- 10% from the average mass between two or more tags). In
30 particular embodiments, the tag has a decreased mass (e.g., less than about 15,000 Daltons, about 14,000 Daltons,
   about 13,000 Daltons, about 12,000 Daltons, about 11,000 Daltons, about 10,000 Daltons, about 9,000 Daltons,
   about 8,000 Daltons, about 7,500 Daltons, about 7,000 Daltons, about 6,000 Daltons, about 6,500 Daltons, about
   5,000 Daltons, about 5,500 Daltons, about 4,000 Daltons, about 4,500 Daltons, or about 3,000 Daltons) compared to
   a double-stranded tag (e.g., a double-stranded tag having a mass of about 15,000 Daltons, about 14,000 Daltons,
35 about 13,000 Daltons, or about 12,000 Daltons). In other embodiments, the tag has a reduced length compared to a
   double-stranded tag (e.g., a double-stranded tag having a length of less than about 20 nucleotides, less than about 19
   nucleotides, less than about 18 nucleotides, less than about 17 nucleotides, less than about 16 nucleotides, less than
   about 15 nucleotides, less than about 14 nucleotides, less than about 13 nucleotides, less than about 12 nucleotides,
   less than about 11 nucleotides, less than about 10 nucleotides, less than about 9 nucleotides, less than about 8
40 nucleotides, or less than about 7 nucleotides). In some embodiments, one or more tags or members of the library
   lack a primer-binding region and/or a constant region (e.g., during a selection step, such as selection using size
                                                                 7
   10163193 1 trHMitari P99090At 11

   exclusion chromatography). In some embodiments, one or more tags or members of the library have a reduced
   constant region (e.g., a length less than about 30 nucleotides, less than about 25 nucleotides, less than about 20
   nucleotides, less than about 19 nucleotides, less than about 18 nucleotides, less than about 17 nucleotides, less than
   about 16 nucleotides, less than about 15 nucleotides, less than about 14 nucleotides, less than about 13 nucleotides,
 5 less than about 12 nucleotides, less than about 11 nucleotides, less than about 10 nucleotides, less than about 9
   nucleotides, less than about 8 nucleotides, or less than about 7 nucleotides). In other embodiments, the methods
   include a headpiece that encodes for a molecule, a portion of a chemical entity, a binding reaction (e.g., chemical or
   enzymatic ligation) of a step, or the identity of a library, where the encoding headpiece eliminates the need of an
   additional tag to encode such information.
10              In any of the above embodiments, an oligonucleotide (e.g., the headpiece, the first tag, and/or one or more
   additional tags, if present) encodes for the identity of the library. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide (e.g.,
   the headpiece, the first tag, and/or one or more additional tags, if present) includes a first library-identifying
   sequence, where the sequence encodes for the identity of the first library. In particular embodiments, the
   oligonucleotide is a first library-identifying tag. In some embodiments, the method includes providing a first
15 library-identifying tag, where the tag includes a sequence that encodes for a first library, and/or binding the first
   library-identifying tag to the complex. In some embodiments, the method includes providing a second library and
   combining the first library with a second library. In further embodiments, the method includes providing a second
   library-identifying tag, where the tag includes a sequence that encodes for a second library. In some embodiments,
   more than two libraries are combined (e.g., three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or more libraries).
20              In any of the above embodiments, the encoded information is provided in one or more tags or in a
   combination of more than one tag. In some embodiments, the encoded information is represented by more than one
   tag (e.g., two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or more tags). In some embodiments, the encoded
   information is represented by more than one tag, where all encoding tags are contained within the encoding
   sequence (e.g., by using of a specific tag combination to encode information). In some embodiments, the encoded
25 information is represented by more than one tag, where less than all encoding tags are contained within the encoding
   sequence (e.g., by using one tag from a set of more than one individual tag to encode within an individual encoding
   sequence). In some embodiments, the encoded information is represented orthogonally, where encoded information
   is represented by a combination of more than one tag with less than all of the encoding information being contained
   within an individual library member, such that more than one corresponding library member needs to be sequenced
30 in order to deconvolute the encoded information. In some embodiments, more than one chemical building block is
   represented by a single tag (e.g., for a racemic building block, such as two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
   ten, or more building blocks represented by a single tag).
                In any of the above embodiments, an oligonucleotide (e.g., a headpiece and/or one or more building blocks)
   encodes for the use of the member of the library (e.g., use in a selection step or a binding step, as described herein).
35 In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide (e.g., the headpiece, the first tag, and/or one or more additional tags, if
   present) include a use sequence, where the sequence encodes for use of a subset of members in the library in one or
   more steps (e.g., a selection step and/or a binding step). In particular embodiments, the oligonucleotide is a use tag
   including a use sequence. In some embodiments, an oligonucleotide (e.g., a headpiece and/or one or more
   oligonucleotide tags) encodes for the origin of the member of the library (e.g., in a particular part of the library). In
40 some embodiments, the oligonucleotide (e.g., the headpiece, the first tag, and/or one or more additional tags, if
   present) includes an origin sequence (e.g., a random or degenerate sequence having a length of about 10, 9, 8, 7, or 6
                                                                   8

   nucleotides), where the sequence encodes for the origin of the member in the library, as compared to other members
   of the library. In particular embodiments, the oligonucleotide is an origin tag including an origin sequence. In some
   embodiments, the method further includes joining, binding, or operatively associating a use tag and/or an origin tag
   to the complex.
 5              In any of the embodiments herein, the methods, compositions, and complexes optionally include a
   tailpiece, where the tailpiece includes one or more of a library-identifying sequence, a use sequence, or an origin
   sequence, as described herein. In particular embodiments, the methods further include joining, binding, or
   operatively associating the tailpiece (e.g., including one or more of a library-identifying sequence, a use sequence, or
   an origin sequence) to the complex.
10              In any of the above embodiments, the methods, compositions, and complexes, or portions thereof (e.g., the
   headpiece, the first tag, and/or the one or more additional tags, if present), includes a modification that support
   solubility in semi-, reduced-, or non-aqueous (e.g., organic) conditions. In some embodiments, the bifunctional
   spacer, headpiece, or one or more tags is modified to increase solubility of a member of said DNA-encoded
   chemical library in organic conditions In some embodiments, the modification is one or more of an alkyl chain, a
15 polyethylene glycol unit, a branched species with positive charges, or a hydrophobic ring structure. In some
   embodiments, the modification includes one or more modified nucleotides having a hydrophobic moiety (e.g.,
   modified at the C5 positions of T or C bases with aliphatic chains, such as in 5'-dimethoxytrityl-N4
   diisobutylaminomethylidene-5-(1-propynyl)-2'-deoxycytidine,3'-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]
   phosphoramidite; 5'-dimethoxytrityl-5-(1-propynyl)-2'-deoxyuridine,3'-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]

   diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite) or an insertion having a hydrophobic moiety (e.g., an azobenzene). In some
   embodiments, the member of the library has an octanol:water coefficient from about 1.0 to about 2.5 (e.g., about 1.0
   to about 1.5, about 1.0 to about 2.0, about 1.3 to about 1.5, about 1.3 to about 2.0, about 1.3 to about 2.5, about 1.5
25 to about 2.0, about 1.5 to about 2.5, or about 2.0 to about 2.5).

   absorption, adsorption, and/or other intermolecular forces. Binding can be effectuated by any useful means, such as
   by enzymatic binding (e.g., enzymatic ligation to provide an enzymatic linkage) or by chemical binding (e.g.,
   chemical ligation to provide a chemical linkage).
                By "building block" is meant a structural unit of a chemical entity, where the unit is directly linked to other
 5 chemical structural units or indirectly linked through the scaffold. When the chemical entity is polymeric or
   oligomeric, the building blocks are the monomeric units of the polymer or oligomer. Building blocks can have one
   or more diversity nodes that allow for the addition of one or more other building blocks or scaffolds. In most cases,
   each diversity node is a functional group capable of reacting with one or more building blocks or scaffolds to form a
   chemical entity. Generally, the building blocks have at least two diversity nodes (or reactive functional groups), but
10 some building blocks may have one diversity node (or reactive functional group). Alternatively, the encoded
   chemical or binding steps may include several chemical components (e.g., multi-component condensation reactions
   or multi-step processes). Reactive groups on two different building blocks should be complementary, i.e., capable
   of reacting together to form a covalent or a non-covalent bond.
                By "chemical entity" is meant a compound comprising one or more building blocks and optionally one or
15 more scaffolds. The chemical entity can be any small molecule or peptide drug or drug candidate designed or built
   to have one or more desired characteristics, e.g., capacity to bind a biological target, solubility, availability of
   hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, rotational degrees of freedom of the bonds, positive charge, negative charge,
   and the like. In certain embodiments, the chemical entity can be reacted further as a bifunctional or trifunctional (or
   greater) entity.
20              By "chemical-reactive group" is meant a reactive group that participates in a modular reaction, thus
   producing a linkage. Exemplary reactions and reactive groups include those selected from a Huisgen 1,3-dipolar
   cycloaddition reaction with a pair of an optionally substituted alkynyl group and an optionally substituted azido
   group; a Diels-Alder reaction with a pair of an optionally substituted diene having a 4 it-electron system and an
   optionally substituted dienophile or an optionally substituted heterodienophile having a 2 it-electron system; a ring
25 opening reaction with a nucleophile and a strained heterocyclyl electrophile; a splint ligation reaction with a
   phosphorothioate group and an iodo group; and a reductive amination reaction with an aldehyde group and an amino
   group, as described herein.
                By "complementary" is meant a sequence capable of hybridizing, as defined herein, to form secondary
   structure (a duplex or a double-stranded portion of a nucleic acid molecule). The complementarity need not be
30 perfect but may include one or more mismatches at one, two, three, or more nucleotides. For example,
   complementary sequence may contain nucleobases that can form hydrogen bonds according to Watson-Crick base
   pairing rules (e.g., G with C, A with T or A with U) or other hydrogen bonding motifs (e.g., diaminopurine with T,
   5-methyl C with G, 2-thiothymidine with A, inosine with C, pseudoisocytosine with G). The sequence and its
   complementary sequence can be present in the same oligonucleotide or in different oligonucleotides.
35              By "complex" or "ligated complex" is meant a headpiece that is operatively associated with a chemical
   entity and/or one or more oligonucleotide tags by a covalent bond or a non-covalent bond. The complex can
   optionally include a bifunctional spacer between the chemical entity and the headpiece.
                By "component'' of a chemical entity is meant either a scaffold or a building block.
                By "connector" of an oligonucleotide tag is meant a portion of the tag at or in proximity to the 5'- or 3'
40 terminus having a fixed sequence. A 5'-connector is located at or in proximity to the 5'-terminus of an
   oligonucleotide, and a 3'-connector is located at or in proximity to the 3'-terminus of an oligonucleotide. When
                                                                 11
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090At 11

   present in a complex, each 5'-connector may be the same or different, and each 3'-connector may be the same or
   different. In an exemplary, non-limiting complex having more than one tags, each tag can include a 5'-connector
   and a 3'-connector, where each 5'-connector has the same sequence and each 3'-connector has the same sequence
   (e.g., where the sequence of the 5'-connector can be the same or different from the sequence of the 3'-connector).
 5 In another exemplary, non-limiting complex, the sequence of the 5'-connector is designed to be complementary, as
   defined herein, to the sequence of the 3'-connector (e.g., to allow for hybridization between 5'- and 3'-connectors).
   The connector can optionally include one or more groups allowing for a linkage (e.g., a linkage for which a
   polymerase has reduced ability to read or translocate through, such as a chemical linkage).
                By "constant" or "fixed constant" sequence is meant a sequence of an oligonucleotide that does not encode
10 information. Non-limiting, exemplary portions of a complex having a constant sequence include a primer-binding
   region, a 5'-connector, or a 3'-connector. The headpiece of the invention can encode information (thus, a tag) or
   alternatively not encode information (thus, a constant sequence). Similary, the tailpiece of the invention can encode
   or not encode information.
                By "cross-linking oligonucleotide" is meant an oligonucleotide that operatively associates, as defined
15 herein, at a particular junction between two adjacent tags in a complex. In a non-limiting example, one terminus of
   the cross-linking oligonucleotide hybridizes to the 3'-connector of a first tag, and the other terminus of the cross
   linking oligonucleotide hybridizes to the 5'-connector of a second tag that is adjacent to the first tag. Exemplary,
   non-limiting embodiments of cross-linking oligonucleotides include those having one or more reactive groups (e.g.,
   a chemical-reactive group, a photo-reactive group, an intercalating moiety, or a reversible co-reactive group, or any
20 described herein) that operatively associates with adjacent tags or connectors of adjacent tags.
                By "diversity node" is meant a functional group at a position in the scaffold or the building block that
   allows for adding another building block.
                By "headpiece" is meant a chemical structure for library synthesis that is operatively linked to a component
   of a chemical entity and to a tag, e.g., a starting oligonucleotide. Optionally a headpiece may contain few or no
25 nucleotides, but may provide a point at which they may be operatively associated. Optionally, a bifunctional spacer
   connects the headpiece to the component.
                By "hybridize" is meant to pair to form a double-stranded molecule between complementary
   oligonucleotides, or portions thereof, under various conditions of stringency. (See, e.g., Wahl, G. M. and S. L.
   Berger (1987) Methods Enzymol. 152:399; Kimmel, A. R. (1987) Methods Enzymol. 152:507.) For example, high
30 stringency hybridization can be obtained with a salt concentration ordinarily less than about 750 mM NaCl and 75
   mM trisodium citrate, less than about 500 mM NaCl and 50 mM trisodium citrate, or less than about 250 mM NaCl
   and 25 mM trisodium citrate. Low stringency hybridization can be obtained in the absence of organic solvent, e.g.,
   formamide, while high stringency hybridization can be obtained in the presence of at least about 35% formamide or
   at least about 50% formamide. High stringency hybridization temperature conditions will ordinarily include
35 temperatures of at least about 30'C, 37"C, or 420 C. Varying additional parameters, such as hybridization time, the
   concentration of detergent, e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and the inclusion or exclusion of carrier DNA, are
   well known to those skilled in the art. Various levels of stringency are accomplished by combining these various
   conditions as needed. In one embodiment, hybridization will occur at 30'C in 750 mM NaCl, 75 mM trisodium
   citrate, and 1%SDS. In an alternative embodiment, hybridization will occur at 370 C in 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM
40 trisodium citrate, 1% SDS, 35% formamide, and 100 ptg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA (ssDNA). In a further
   alternative embodiment, hybridization will occur at 42"C in 250 mM NaCl, 25 mM trisodium citrate, 1% SDS, 50%
                                                                12
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090At 11

   formamide, and 200 pg/ml ssDNA. Useful variations on these conditions will be readily apparent to those skilled in
   the art.
                For most applications, washing steps that follow hybridization will also vary in stringency. Wash
   stringency conditions can be defined by salt concentration and by temperature. As above, wash stringency can be
 5 increased by decreasing salt concentration or by increasing temperature. For example, high stringency salt
   concentrations for the wash steps may be, e.g., less than about 30 mM NaCl and 3 mM trisodium citrate, or less than
   about 15 mM NaCl and 1.5 mM trisodium citrate. High stringency temperature conditions for the wash steps will
   ordinarily include a temperature of, e.g., at least about 25"C, 42"C, or 68"C. In one embodiment, wash steps will
   occur at 250 C in 30 mM NaCl, 3 mM trisodium citrate, and 0.1% SDS. In an alternative embodiment, wash steps
10 will occur at 42"C in 15 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM trisodium citrate, and 0.1% SDS. In a further alternative embodiment,
   wash steps will occur at 680 C in 15 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM trisodium citrate, and 0.1% SDS. Additional variations on
   these conditions will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Hybridization techniques are well known to
   those skilled in the art and are described, for example, in Benton and Davis (Science 196:180, 1977); Grunstein and
   Hogness (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 72:3961, 1975); Ausubel et al. (Current Protocols in Molecular Biology,
15 Wiley Interscience, New York, 2001); Berger and Kimmel (Guide to Molecular Cloning Techniques, 1987,
   Academic Press, New York); and Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor
   Laboratory Press, New York.
                By "intercalating moiety" is meant a reactive group that results in inclusion of a moiety between two or
   more nucleotides. In a non-limiting example, the intercalating moiety reacts with one or more nucleotides to form
20 inter- or intra-strand cross-links between duplex or triplex oligonucleotides. Exemplary, non-limiting intercalating
   moieties are described herein.
                By "junction" is meant a nick (lack of an internucleotide bond) or a gap (lack of one or more nucleotides)
   between two adjacent tags in a complex. The junction can also be between two adjacent connectors present in two
   adjacent tags (e.g., between the 3'-connector of a first tag and the 5'-connector of a second tag that is adjacent to the
25 first tag).
                By "library" is meant a collection of molecules or chemical entities. Optionally, the molecules or chemical
   entities are bound to one or more oligonucleotides that encodes for the molecules or portions of the chemical entity.
                By "linkage" is meant a chemical connecting entity that allows for operatively associating two or more
   chemical structures, where the linkage is present between the headpiece and one or more tags, between two tags, or
30 between a tag and a tailpiece. The chemical connecting entity can be a non-covalent bond (e.g., as described
   herein), a covalent bond, or a reaction product between two functional groups. By "chemical linkage" is meant a
   linkage formed by a non-enzymatic, chemical reaction between two functional groups. Exemplary, non-limiting
   functional groups include a chemical-reactive group, a photo-reactive group, an intercalating moiety, or a cross
   linking oligonucleotide (e.g., as described herein). By "enzymatic linkage" is meant an internucleotide or
35 internucleoside linkage formed by an enzyme. Exemplary, non-limiting enzymes include a kinase, a polymerase, a
   ligase, or combinations thereof. By a linkage "for which a polymerase has reduced ability to read or translocate
   through" is meant a linkage, when present in an oligonucleotide template, that provides a reduced amount of
   elongated and/or amplified products by a polymerase, as compared to a control oligonucleotide lacking the linkage.
   Exemplary, non-limiting methods for determining such a linkage include primer extension as assessed by PCR
40 analysis (e.g., quantitative PCR), RT-PCR analysis, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, sequence
   demographics, or other methods. Exemplary, non-limiting polymerases include DNA polymerases and RNA
                                                                 13
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090Al 11

   polymerases, such as DNA polymerase I, DNA polymerase II, DNA polymerase III, DNA polymerase VI, Taq
   DNA polymerase, Deep VentRTM DNA Polymerase (high-fidelity thermophilic DNA polymerase, available from
   New England Biolabs), T7 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase I, RNA polymerase II, RNA
   polymerase III, or T7 RNA polymerase.
 5              By "multivalent cation" is meant a cation capable of forming more than one bond with more than one
   ligand or anion. The multivalent cation can form either an ionic complex or a coordination complex. Exemplary
   multivalent cations include those from the alkali earth metals (e.g., magnesium) and transition metals (e.g.,
   manganese (II) or cobalt (III)), and those that are optionally bound to one or more anions and/or one or more
   univalent or polydentate ligands, such as chloride, amine, and/or ethylenediamine.
10              By "oligonucleotide" is meant a polymer of nucleotides having a 5'-terminus, a 3'-terminus, and one or
   more nucleotides at the internal position between the 5'- and 3'-termini. The oligonucleotide may include DNA,
   RNA, or any derivative thereof known in the art that can be synthesized and used for base-pair recognition. The
   oligonucleotide does not have to have contiguous bases but can be interspersed with linker moieties. The
   oligonucleotide polymer and nucleotide (e.g., modified DNA or RNA) may include natural bases (e.g., adenosine,
15 thymidine, guanosine, cytidine, uridine, deoxyadenosine, deoxythymidine, deoxyguanosine, deoxycytidine, inosine,
   or diamino purine), base analogs (e.g., 2-aminoadenosine, 2-thiothymidine, inosine, pyrrolo-pyrimidine, 3-methyl
   adenosine, C5-propynylcytidine, C5-propynyluridine, C5-bromouridine, C5-fluorouridine, C5-iodouridine,
   C5-methylcytidine, 7-deazaadenosine, 7-deazaguanosine, 8-oxoadenosine, 8-oxoguanosine, 0(6)-methylguanine,
   and 2-thiocytidine), modified bases (e.g., 2'-substituted nucleotides, such as 2'-O-methylated bases and 2'-fluoro
20 bases), intercalated bases, modified sugars (e.g., 2'-fluororibose; ribose; 2'-deoxyribose; arabinose; hexose;
   anhydrohexitol; altritol; mannitol; cyclohexanyl; cyclohexenyl; morpholino that also has a phosphoramidate
   backbone; locked nucleic acids (LNA, e.g., where the 2'-hydroxyl of the ribose is connected by a C1 .6 alkylene or
   C1 .6 heteroalkylene bridge to the 4'-carbon of the same ribose sugar, where exemplary bridges included methylene,
   propylene, ether, or amino bridges); glycol nucleic acid (GNA, e.g., R-GNA or S-GNA, where ribose is replaced by
25 glycol units attached to phosphodiester bonds); threose nucleic acid (TNA, where ribose is replace with a-L
   threofuranosyl-(3'--2')); and/or replacement of the oxygen in ribose (e.g., with S, Se, or alkylene, such as
   methylene or ethylene)), modified backbones (e.g., peptide nucleic acid (PNA), where 2-amino-ethyl-glycine
   linkages replace the ribose and phosphodiester backbone), and/or modified phosphate groups (e.g.,
   phosphorothioates, 5'-N-phosphoramidites, phosphoroselenates, boranophosphates, boranophosphate esters,
30 hydrogen phosphonates, phosphoramidates, phosphorodiamidates, alkyl or aryl phosphonates, phosphotriesters,
   bridged phosphoramidates, bridged phosphorothioates, and bridged methylene-phosphonates). The oligonucleotide
   can be single-stranded (e.g., hairpin), double-stranded, or possess other secondary or tertiary structures (e.g., stem
   loop structures, double helixes, triplexes, quadruplexes, etc.).
                By "operatively linked" or "operatively associated" is meant that two or more chemical structures are
35 directly or indirectly linked together in such a way as to remain linked through the various manipulations they are
   expected to undergo. Typically, the chemical entity and the headpiece are operatively associated in an indirect
   manner (e.g., covalently via an appropriate spacer). For example, the spacer may be a bifunctional moiety with a
   site of attachment for chemical entity and a site of attachment for the headpiece.
                By "photo-reactive group" is meant a reactive group that participates in a reaction caused by absorption of
40 ultraviolet, visible, or infrared radiation, thus producing a linkage. Exemplary, non-limiting photo-reactive groups
   are described herein.
                                                                 14
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090At 11

                By "protecting group" is a meant a group intended to protect the 3'-terminus or 5'-terminus of an
   oligonucleotide or to protect one or more functional groups of the chemical entity, scaffold, or building block
   against undesirable reactions during one or more binding steps of making, tagging, or using an oligonucleotide
   encoded library. Commonly used protecting groups are disclosed in Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic
 5 Synthesis,"      4 th  Edition (John Wiley & Sons, New York, 2007), which is incorporated herein by reference.
   Exemplary protecting groups for oligonucleotides include irreversible protecting groups, such as dideoxynucleotides
   and dideoxynucleosides (ddNTP or ddN), and, more preferably, reversible protecting groups for hydroxyl groups,
   such as ester groups (e.g., 0-(a-methoxyethyl)ester, O-isovaleryl ester, and O-levulinyl ester), trityl groups (e.g.,
   dimethoxytrityl and monomethoxytrityl), xanthenyl groups (e.g., 9-phenylxanthen-9-yl and 9-(p
10 methoxyphenyl)xanthen-9-yl), acyl groups (e.g., phenoxyacetyl and acetyl), and silyl groups (e.g., t
   butyldimethylsilyl). Exemplary, non-limiting protecting groups for chemical entities, scaffolds, and building blocks
   include N-protecting groups to protect an amino group against undesirable reactions during synthetic procedure
   (e.g., acyl; aryloyl; carbamyl groups, such as formyl, acetyl, propionyl, pivaloyl, t-butylacetyl, 2-chloroacetyl, 2
   bromoacetyl, trifluoroacetyl, trichloroacetyl, phthalyl, o-nitrophenoxyacetyl, a-chlorobutyryl, benzoyl, 4

   groups, such as phenoxycarbonyl, p-nitrophenoxycarbonyl, o-nitrophenoxycarbonyl, 2,4-dinitrophenoxycarbonyl, p
   methyl-phenoxycarbonyl, m-methylphenoxycarbonyl, o-bromophenoxycarbonyl, 3,5-dimethylphenoxycarbonyl, p
   chlorophenoxycarbonyl, 2-chloro-4-nitrophenoxy-carbonyl, and the like); carbonyl-protecting groups (e.g., acetal
 5 and ketal groups, such as dimethyl acetal, 1,3-dioxolane, and the like; acylal groups; and dithiane groups, such as
   1,3-dithianes, 1,3-dithiolane, and the like); carboxylic acid-protecting groups (e.g., ester groups, such as methyl
   ester, benzyl ester, t-butyl ester, orthoesters, and the like; silyl groups, such as trimethylsilyl, as well as any
   described herein; and oxazoline groups); and phosphate-protecting groups (e.g., optionally substituted ester groups,

   p-hydroxyphenacyl ester, and the like).
                By "proximity" or "in proximity" to a terminus of an oligonucleotide is meant near or closer to the stated
   terminus than the other remaining terminus. For example, a moiety or group in proximity to the 3'-terminus of an
   oligonucleotide is near or closer to the 3'-terminus than the 5'-terminus. In particular embodiments, a moiety or
15 group in proximity to the 3'-terminus of an oligonucleotide is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
   fifteen, or more nucleotides from the 3'-terminus. In other embodiments, a moiety or group in proximity to the 5'
   terminus of an oligonucleotide is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, fifteen, or more nucleotides
   from the 5'-terminus.
                By "purifying" is meant removing any unreacted product or any agent present in a reaction mixture that
20 may reduce the activity of a chemical or biological agent to be used in a successive step. Purifying can include one
   or more of chromatographic separation, electrophoretic separation, and precipitation of the unreacted product or
   reagent to be removed.
                By "reversible co-reactive group" is meant a reactive group that participates in a reversible reaction.
   Exemplary, non-limiting reactive groups include photo-reactive groups, where exposure to a particular absorption
25 radiation results in a linkage between the photo-reactive groups and exposure to a different, particular absorption
   radiation results in cleavage of the formed linkage (e.g., a cyanovinylcarbazole group, a cyanovinyl group, and an
   acrylamide group). Another exemplary, non-limiting reactive group includes redox-reactive groups, where such
   groups can be reversibly reduced or oxidized (e.g., a thiol group).
                By "scaffold" is meant a chemical moiety that displays one or more diversity nodes in a particular special
30 geometry. Diversity nodes are typically attached to the scaffold during library synthesis, but in some cases one
   diversity node can be attached to the scaffold prior to library synthesis (e.g., addition of one or more building blocks
   and/or one or more tags). In some embodiments, the scaffold is derivatized such that it can be orthogonally
   deprotected during library synthesis and subsequently reacted with different diversity nodes.
                By "small molecule" drug or "small molecule" drug candidate is meant a molecule that has a molecular
35 weight below about 1,000 Daltons. Small molecules may be organic or inorganic, isolated (e.g., from compound
   libraries or natural sources), or obtained by derivatization of known compounds.
                By "substantial identity" or "substantially identical" is meant a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence that
   has the same polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence, respectively, as a reference sequence, or has a specified
   percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides, respectively, that are the same at the corresponding location within
40 a reference sequence when the two sequences are optimally aligned. For example, an amino acid sequence that is
   "substantially identical" to a reference sequence has at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%,
                                                                   16

   97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identity to the reference amino acid sequence. For polypeptides, the length of comparison
   sequences will generally be at least 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 contiguous amino acids,
   more preferably at least 25, 50, 75, 90, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, or 350 contiguous amino acids, and most preferably
   the full-length amino acid sequence. For nucleic acids, the length of comparison sequences will generally be at least
 5 5 contiguous nucleotides, preferably at least 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25
   contiguous nucleotides, and most preferably the full length nucleotide sequence. Sequence identity may be
   measured using sequence analysis software on the default setting (e.g., Sequence Analysis Software Package of the
   Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center, 1710 University Avenue, Madison, WI
   53705). Such software may match similar sequences by assigning degrees of homology to various substitutions,
10 deletions, and other modifications.
                By "tag" or "oligonucleotide tag" is meant an oligonucleotide portion of the library at least part of which
   encodes information. Non-limiting examples of such information include the addition (e.g., by a binding reaction)
   of a component (i.e., a scaffold or a building block, as in a scaffold tag or a building block tag, respectively), the
   headpiece in the library, the identity of the library (i.e., as in an identity tag), the use of the library (i.e., as in a use
15 tag), and/or the origin of a library member (i.e., as in an origin tag).
                By "tailpiece" is meant an oligonucleotide portion of the library that is attached to the complex after the
   addition of all of the preceding tags and encodes for the identity of the library, the use of the library, and/or the
   origin of a library member.
                By "primer" is meant an oligonucleotide that is capable of annealing to an oligonucleotide template and
20 then being extended by a polymerase in a template-dependent manner.
                By "relay primer" is meant an oligonucleotide that is capable of annealing to an oligonucleotide template
   that contains, in the region of the template to which the primer is hybridized, at least one internucleotide linkage that
   reduces the ability of a polymerase to read or translocate through. Upon hybridization, one or more relay primers
   allow for extension by a polymerase in a template dependent manner.
25              By "recombination," as used herein, is meant the generation of a polymerase product as a result of at least
   two distinct hybridization events.
                Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following Detailed Description
   and the claims.
30                                              Brief Description of the Drawings
                Figures 1A-1B shows exemplary complexes. Figure 1A shows a complex (from the 5' to 3' direction)
   having a chemical entity (star), a fixed constant sequence (e.g., a headpiece), followed by three variable encoding
   sequences (e.g., three tags), and another fixed constant sequence (e.g., a tailpiece), where the linkage between the
   fixed constant sequences and variable encoding sequences are readable. The complex can be further extended using
35 a polymerase with a primer (hybridized to the 3'-terminus of the complex), optionally amplified with PCR, and
   sequenced. Figure lB shows a complex having unreadable linkages. The complex (from the 5' to 3' direction) has
   a chemical entity (star), a fixed constant sequence (e.g., a headpiece), followed by three variable encoding sequences
   (e.g., three tags), and another fixed constant sequence (e.g., a tailpiece), where the linkage between the fixed
   constant sequences and variable encoding sequences are unreadable. Each of the variable encoding sequences
40 includes a 5'-connector and a 3'-connector that are fixed constant sequences. Because the linkages are unreadable,
   relay primers are used to span the linkages and to allow for extension with a polymerase, thus forming
                                                                  17

   oligonucleotide fragments. The fragments are then ligated using ligase, optionally amplified with PCR, and
   sequenced. The reading process (e.g., optional extension, ligation, optional amplification, and sequencing) may
   optionally be entirely performed after selection. Alternatively, the optional extension and ligation part of the
   reading process may be performed prior to selection.
 5              Figure 2 show an exemplary complex having an unreadable linkage formed by psoralen. The schematic
   provides (from the 5' to 3' direction) a variable encoding sequence, a 3'-connector, a 5'-connector, and another
   variable encoding sequence. The 3'-connector and 5'-connector hybridizes to form a duplex, and psoralen (an
   intercalating, photo-reactive moiety) forms an unreadable linkage between the 5'- and 3'-connectors. The relay
   primer hybridizes to the 5'- and 3'-connectors and spans the unreadable linkage. The readable portions of the
10 complex (e.g., the variable encoding sequence) are extended with a polymerase to form oligonucleotide fragments.
   The fragments and relay primers are ligated using ligase, optionally amplified with PCR, and sequenced. The
   reading process (e.g., extension, ligation, optional amplification, and sequencing) may optionally be entirely
   performed after selection. Alternatively, the extension and ligation part of the reading process may be performed
   prior to selection.
15              Figure 3 show an exemplary complex having unreadable linkages formed by a cross-linking
   oligonucleotide. In the top schematic, the complex includes (from the 5' to 3' direction) a chemical entity (star), a
   fixed constant sequence (e.g., a headpiece), a cross-linking oligonucleotide that is cross-linked via a reversible co
   reactive group (e.g., cyanovinylcarbazole groups cross-linked at about 366 nm, cross-links marked with X), and
   followed by a variable encoding sequence having fixed constant sequences at the 5'- and 3'-termini (e.g., a tag
20 having 5'- and 3'-connectors). The combination of the cross-linking oligonucleotide and variable encoding
   sequence are repeated three more times. Then, the final cross-linking oligonucleotide and another fixed constant
   sequence (e.g., a tailpiece) follows. The cross-links are marked with X. Next, the complex is reacted with a
   chemical process and/or an enzymatic process (e.g., a ligase and optionally a kinase) to ligate the tags. Next, the
   cross-linking oligonucleotides are released to form a template (e.g., using absorption at about 312 nm). Finally, the
25 template is optionally amplified with PCR and sequenced. The reading process (e.g., optional kinase step, ligation,
   optional amplification, and sequencing) may optionally be entirely performed after selection. Alternatively, the
   optional kinase step and ligation step of the reading process may be performed prior to selection.
                Figure 4 shows an exemplary reversible reaction with reversible co-reactive groups (a pair of a
   cyanovinylcarbazole group and a thymidine) and use of these groups permits the formation of cross-links between
30 the cross-linking oligonucleotide and the fixed constant sequence of the oligonucleotide tag. Reversible co-reactive
   groups (marked by X and X') are present in the 3'-connector, 5'-connector, and cross-linking oligonucleotide.

                                                     Detailed Description
                We have developed complexes having at least one linkage (e.g., a chemical linkage) for which a
   polymerase has reduced ability to read or translocate through. The ability to tag libraries without being constrained
35 by readability of a polymerase greatly expands the range of tagging methods that can be used. Possible, non
   limiting advantages include decreased mass of tags and/or library members; increased solubility of library members
   in various reaction conditions (e.g., in aqueous and/or organic conditions suitable for both chemical entity and tag
   synthesis); increased stability (e.g., in aqueous and/or organic reaction conditions, where such oligonucleotide tags
   and linkages may be more resistant to particular reaction conditions, as compared to tag without such linkages);
40 decreased cost (e.g., reduce use of expensive enzyme reagents); increased ease of use (e.g., use of
   cyanovinylcarbazole cross-linking occurs over a broad pH range of 5.5-9.5, which permits cross-linking under
                                                               20
   10163193 1 (CHMfteri P99090At 11

   reaction conditions suitable for forming the chemical entity-portion of the complex); reduced number of reaction
   steps and reduced use of reagent(s) (e.g., reduced use of a buffer exchange step, such as during combinatorial split
   reactions, where thousands of individual, small aliquots need to be independently processed; a precipitation step, or
   a pH-modification step); increased fidelity (e.g., when hybridization-mediated methods are used to reduce the
 5 frequency of occurrence of mis-tagging events); and increased compatibility with reaction conditions for forming
   the chemical entity (e.g., allows for use of orthogonal functionalities, where unique, tagging chemistries (e.g., use of
   UV irradiation) can be used that will not occur during post-split/mix step(s), which will also reduce the frequency of
   mis-tagging events).
                Because such linkages may have reduced readability by a polymerase, we have also developed methods to
10 allow for sequencing such complexes. These methods include use of relay primers to span the linkages and/or use
   of releasable cross-linking oligonucleotides. These complexes and methods can be used to create diverse libraries of
   selectable chemical entities by establishing an encoded relationship between particular tags and particular chemical
   reactions or building blocks. To identify one or more chemical entities, the oligonucleotide tags can be amplified,
   cloned, sequenced, and correlated by using the established relationship. Methods of creating and tagging libraries of
15 these complexes are described in detail below.
   Complexes
                This invention features a complex including a chemical entity, one or more tags, and a headpiece
   operatively associated with the chemical entity and one or more tags. At least one of the linkages between the
20 headpiece and the tag or between two tags is a linkage for which a polymerase has reduced ability to read or
   translocate through. The chemical entities, headpieces, tags, linkages, and bifunctional spacers are further described
   below.
                Chemical Entities
25              The chemical entities or members (e.g., small molecules or peptides) of the invention can include one or
   more building blocks and optionally include one or more scaffolds.
                The scaffold S can be a single atom or a molecular scaffold. Exemplary single atom scaffolds include a
   carbon atom, a boron atom, a nitrogen atom, or a phosphorus atom, etc. Exemplary polyatomic scaffolds include a
   cycloalkyl group, a cycloalkenyl group, a heterocycloalkyl group, a heterocycloalkenyl group, an aryl group, or a
30 heteroaryl group. Particular embodiments of a heteroaryl scaffold include a triazine, such as 1,3,5-triazine, 1,2,3
   triazine, or 1,2,4-triazine; a pyrimidine; a pyrazine; a pyridazine; a furan; a pyrrole; a pyrrolline; a pyrrolidine; an
   oxazole; a pyrazole; an isoxazole; a pyran; a pyridine; an indole; an indazole; or a purine.
                The scaffold S can be operatively linked to the tag by any useful method. In one example, S is a triazine
   that is linked directly to the headpiece. To obtain this exemplary scaffold, trichlorotriazine (i.e., a chlorinated
35 precursor of triazine having three chlorines) is reacted with a nucleophilic group of the headpiece. Using this
   method, S has three positions having chlorine that are available for substitution, where two positions are available
   diversity nodes and one position is attached to the headpiece. Next, building block A. is added to a diversity node of
   the scaffold, and tag A. encoding for building block A. ("tag An") is ligated to the headpiece, where these two steps
   can be performed in any order. Then, building block B. is added to the remaining diversity node, and tag B.
40 encoding for building block B. is ligated to the end of tag A.. In another example, S is a triazine that is operatively
                                                                 21
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090At 11

   linked to a tag, where trichlorotriazine is reacted with a nucleophilic group (e.g., an amino group) of a PEG,
   aliphatic, or aromatic linker of a tag. Building blocks and associated tags can be added, as described above.
                In yet another example, S is a triazine that is operatively linked to building block A.. To obtain this
   scaffold, building block A. having two diversity nodes (e.g., an electrophilic group and a nucleophilic group, such as
 5 an Fmoc-amino acid) is reacted with the nucleophilic group of a linker (e.g., the terminal group of a PEG, aliphatic,
   or aromatic linker, which is attached to a headpiece). Then, trichlorotriazine is reacted with a nucleophilic group of
   building block An. Using this method, all three chlorine positions of S are used as diversity nodes for building
   blocks. As described herein, additional building blocks and tags can be added, and additional scaffolds S. can be
   added.
10              Exemplary building block A.'s include, e.g., amino acids (e.g., alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-, and epsilon
   amino acids, as well as derivatives of natural and unnatural amino acids), chemical-reactive reactants (e.g., azide or
   alkyne chains) with an amine, or a thiol reactant, or combinations thereof. The choice of building block A. depends
   on, for example, the nature of the reactive group used in the linker, the nature of a scaffold moiety, and the solvent
   used for the chemical synthesis.
                Exemplary building block B.'s and C's include any useful structural unit of a chemical entity, such as
   optionally substituted aromatic groups (e.g., optionally substituted phenyl or benzyl), optionally substituted
   heterocyclyl groups (e.g., optionally substituted quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, azaindolyl,
   benzimidazolyl, azabenzimidazolyl, benzisoxazolyl, pyridinyl, piperidyl, or pyrrolidinyl), optionally substituted
   alkyl groups (e.g., optionally substituted linear or branched C 1 -6 alkyl groups or optionally substituted C 1-6
   aminoalkyl groups), or optionally substituted carbocyclyl groups (e.g., optionally substituted cyclopropyl,
   cyclohexyl, or cyclohexenyl). Particularly useful building block B.'s and C's include those with one or more
   reactive groups, such as an optionally substituted group (e.g., any described herein) having one or optional
   substituents that are reactive groups or can be chemically modified to form reactive groups. Exemplary reactive
   groups include one or more of amine (-NR 2, where each R is, independently, H or an optionally substituted C1-6
   alkyl), hydroxy, alkoxy (-OR, where R is an optionally substituted C 1 -6 alkyl, such as methoxy), carboxy (-COOH),
   amide, or chemical-reactive substituents. A restriction site may be introduced, for example, in tag B. or C, where a
   complex can be identified by performing PCR and restriction digest with one of the corresponding restriction
   enzymes.
15
                Headpiece
                In the library, the headpiece operatively links each chemical entity to its encoding oligonucleotide tag.
   Generally, the headpiece is a starting oligonucleotide having two functional groups that can be further derivatized,
   where the first functional group operatively links the chemical entity (or a component thereof) to the headpiece and
20 the second functional group operatively links one or more tags to the headpiece. A bifunctional spacer can
   optionally be used as a spacing moiety between the headpiece and the chemical entity.
                The functional groups of the headpiece can be used to form a covalent bond with a component of the
   chemical entity and another covalent bond with a tag. The component can be any part of the small molecule, such as
   a scaffold having diversity nodes or a building block. Alternatively, the headpiece can be derivatized to provide a
25 spacer (i.e., a spacing moiety separating the headpiece from the small molecule to be formed in the library)
   terminating in a functional group (e.g., a hydroxyl, amine, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, alkynyl, azido, or phosphate group),
   which is used to form the covalent linkage with a component of the chemical entity. The spacer can be attached to
                                                                   22
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090At 11

   the 5'-terminus, at one of the internal positions, or to the 3'-terminus of the headpiece. When the spacer is attached
   to one of the internal positions, the spacer can be operatively linked to a derivatized base (e.g., the C5 position of
   uridine) or placed internally within the oligonucleotide using standard techniques known in the art. Exemplary
   spacers are described herein.
 5              The headpiece can have any useful structure. The headpiece can be, e.g., 1 to 100 nucleotides in length,
   preferably 5 to 20 nucleotides in length, and most preferably 5 to 15 nucleotides in length. The headpiece can be
   single-stranded or double-stranded and can consist of natural or modified nucleotides, as described herein. For
   example, the chemical moiety can be operatively linked to the 3'-terminus or 5'-terminus of the headpiece. In
   particular embodiments, the headpiece includes a hairpin structure formed by complementary bases within the
10 sequence. For example, the chemical moiety can be operatively linked to the internal position, the 3'-terminus, or
   the 5'-terminus of the headpiece.
                Generally, the headpiece includes a non-self-complementary sequence on the 5'- or 3'- terminus that allows
   for binding an oligonucleotide tag by polymerization, enzymatic ligation, or chemical reaction. The headpiece can
   allow for ligation of oligonucleotide tags and optional purification and phosphorylation steps. After the addition of
15 the last tag, an additional adapter sequence can be added to the 5'-terminus of the last tag. Exemplary adapter
   sequences include a primer-binding sequence or a sequence having a label (e.g., biotin). In cases where many
   building blocks and corresponding tags are used (e.g., 100), a mix-and-split strategy may be employed during the
   oligonucleotide synthesis step to create the necessary number of tags. Such mix-and-split strategies for DNA
   synthesis are known in the art. The resultant library members can be amplified by PCR following selection for
20 binding entities versus a target(s) of interest.
                The headpiece or the complex can optionally include one or more primer-binding sequences. For example,
   the headpiece has a sequence in the loop region of the hairpin that serves as a primer-binding region for
   amplification, where the primer-binding region has a higher melting temperature for its complementary primer (e.g.,
   which can include flanking identifier regions) than for a sequence in the headpiece. In other embodiments, the
25 complex includes two primer-binding sequences (e.g., to enable a PCR reaction) on either side of one or more tags
   that encode one or more building blocks. Alternatively, the headpiece may contain one primer-binding sequence on
   the 5'- or 3'-terminus. In other embodiments, the headpiece is a hairpin, and the loop region forms a primer-binding
   site or the primer-binding site is introduced through hybridization of an oligonucleotide to the headpiece on the 3'
   side of the loop. A primer oligonucleotide, containing a region homologous to the 3'-terminus of the headpiece and
30 carrying a primer-binding region on its 5'-terminus (e.g., to enable a PCR reaction) may be hybridized to the
   headpiece and may contain a tag that encodes a building block or the addition of a building block. The primer
   oligonucleotide may contain additional information, such as a region of randomized nucleotides, e.g., 2 to 16
   nucleotides in length, which is included for bioinformatics analysis.
                The headpiece can optionally include a hairpin structure, where this structure can be achieved by any useful
35 method. For example, the headpiece can include complementary bases that form intermolecular base pairing
   partners, such as by Watson-Crick DNA base pairing (e.g., adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine) and/or by
   wobble base pairing (e.g., guanine-uracil, inosine-uracil, inosine-adenine, and inosine-cytosine). In another
   example, the headpiece can include modified or substituted nucleotides that can form higher affinity duplex
   formations compared to unmodified nucleotides, such modified or substituted nucleotides being known in the art. In
40 yet another example, the headpiece includes one or more cross-linked bases to form the hairpin structure. For
                                                                23
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090At 11

   example, bases within a single strand or bases in different double strands can be cross-linked, e.g., by using
   psoralen.
                The headpiece or complex can optionally include one or more labels that allow for detection. For example,
   the headpiece, one or more oligonucleotide tags, and/or one or more primer sequences can include an isotope, a
 5 radioimaging agent, a marker, a tracer, a fluorescent label (e.g., rhodamine or fluorescein), a chemiluminescent
   label, a quantum dot, and a reporter molecule (e.g., biotin or a his-tag).
                In other embodiments, the headpiece or tag may be modified to support solubility in semi-, reduced-, or
   non-aqueous (e.g., organic) conditions. Nucleotide bases of the headpiece or tag can be rendered more hydrophobic
   by modifying, for example, the C5 positions of T or C bases with aliphatic chains without significantly disrupting
10 their ability to hydrogen bond to their complementary bases. Exemplary modified or substituted nucleotides are 5'
   dimethoxytrityl-N4-diisobutylaminomethylidene-5-(1-propynyl)-2'-deoxycytidine,3'-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N
   diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite; 5'-dimethoxytrityl-5-(1-propynyl)-2'-deoxyuridine,3'-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N
   diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite; 5'-dimethoxytrityl-5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine,3'-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]
   phosphoramidite; and 5'-dimethoxytrityl-5-(pyren-1-yl-ethynyl)-2'-deoxyuridine, or 3'-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N
15 diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite.
                In addition, the headpiece oligonucleotide can be interspersed with modifications that promote solubility in
   organic solvents. For example, azobenzene phosphoramidite can introduce a hydrophobic moiety into the headpiece
   design. Such insertions of hydrophobic amidites into the headpiece can occur anywhere in the molecule. However,
   the insertion cannot interfere with subsequent tagging using additional DNA tags during the library synthesis or
20 ensuing PCR once a selection is complete or microarray analysis, if used for tag deconvolution. Such additions to
   the headpiece design described herein would render the headpiece soluble in, for example, 15%, 25%, 30%, 50%,
   75%, 90 %, 95%, 98%, 99%, or 100% organic solvent. Thus, addition of hydrophobic residues into the headpiece
   design allows for improved solubility in semi- or non-aqueous (e.g., organic) conditions, while rendering the
   headpiece competent for oligonucleotide tagging. Furthermore, DNA tags that are subsequently introduced into the
25 library can also be modified at the C5 position of T or C bases such that they also render the library more
   hydrophobic and soluble in organic solvents for subsequent steps of library synthesis.
                In particular embodiments, the headpiece and the first tag can be the same entity, i.e., a plurality of
   headpiece-tag entities can be constructed that all share common parts (e.g., a primer-binding region) and all differ in
   another part (e.g., encoding region). These may be utilized in the "split" step and pooled after the event they are
30 encoding has occurred.
                In particular embodiments, the headpiece can encode information, e.g., by including a sequence that
   encodes the first split(s) step or a sequence that encodes the identity of the library, such as by using a particular
   sequence related to a specific library.
35              Oligonucleotide tags
                The oligonucleotide tags described herein (e.g., a tag or a portion of a headpiece or a portion of a tailpiece)
   can be used to encode any useful information, such as a molecule, a portion of a chemical entity, the addition of a
   component (e.g., a scaffold or a building block), a headpiece in the library, the identity of the library, the use of one
   or more library members (e.g., use of the members in an aliquot of a library), and/or the origin of a library member
40 (e.g., by use of an origin sequence).
                                                                 24
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090At 11

                Any sequence in an oligonucleotide can be used to encode any information. Thus, one oligonucleotide
   sequence can serve more than one purpose, such as to encode two or more types of information or to provide a
   starting oligonucleotide that also encodes for one or more types of information. For example, the first tag can
   encode for the addition of a first building block, as well as for the identification of the library. In another example, a
 5 headpiece can be used to provide a starting oligonucleotide that operatively links a chemical entity to a tag, where
   the headpiece additionally includes a sequence that encodes for the identity of the library (i.e., the library-identifying
   sequence). Accordingly, any of the information described herein can be encoded in separate oligonucleotide tags or
   can be combined and encoded in the same oligonucleotide sequence (e.g., an oligonucleotide tag, such as a tag, or a
   headpiece).
10              A building block sequence encodes for the identity of a building block and/or the type of binding reaction
   conducted with a building block. This building block sequence is included in a tag, where the tag can optionally
   include one or more types of sequence described below (e.g., a library-identifying sequence, a use sequence, and/or
   an origin sequence).
                A library-identifying sequence encodes for the identity of a particular library. In order to permit mixing of
15 two or more libraries, a library member may contain one or more library-identifying sequences, such as in a library
   identifying tag (i.e., an oligonucleotide including a library-identifying sequence), in a ligated tag, in a part of the
   headpiece sequence, or in a tailpiece sequence. These library-identifying sequences can be used to deduce encoding
   relationships, where the sequence of the tag is translated and correlated with chemical (synthesis) history
   information. Accordingly, these library-identifying sequences permit the mixing of two or more libraries together
20 for selection, amplification, purification, sequencing, etc.
                A use sequence encodes the history (i.e., use) of one or more library members in an individual aliquot of a
   library. For example, separate aliquots may be treated with different reaction conditions, building blocks, and/or
   selection steps. In particular, this sequence may be used to identify such aliquots and deduce their history (use) and
   thereby permit the mixing together of aliquots of the same library with different histories (uses) (e.g., distinct
25 selection experiments) for the purposes of the mixing together of samples together for selection, amplification,
   purification, sequencing, etc. These use sequences can be included in a headpiece, a tailpiece, a tag, a use tag (i.e.,
   an oligonucleotide including a use sequence), or any other tag described herein (e.g., a library-identifying tag or an
   origin tag).
                An origin sequence is a degenerate (random, stochastically-generated) oligonucleotide sequence of any
30 useful length (e.g., about six oligonucleotides) that encodes for the origin of the library member. This sequence
   serves to stochastically subdivide library members that are otherwise identical in all respects into entities
   distinguishable by sequence information, such that observations of amplification products derived from unique
   progenitor templates (e.g., selected library members) can be distinguished from observations of multiple
   amplification products derived from the same progenitor template (e.g., a selected library member). For example,
35 after library formation and prior to the selection step, each library member can include a different origin sequence,
   such as in an origin tag. After selection, selected library members can be amplified to produce amplification
   products, and the portion of the library member expected to include the origin sequence (e.g., in the origin tag) can
   be observed and compared with the origin sequence in each of the other library members. As the origin sequences
   are degenerate, each amplification product of each library member should have a different origin sequence.
40 However, an observation of the same origin sequence in the amplification product could indicate multiple amplicons
   derived from the same template molecule. When it is desired to determine the statistics and demographics of the
                                                                 25
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090At 11

   population of encoding tags prior to amplification, as opposed to post-amplification, the origin tag may be used.
   These origin sequences can be included in a headpiece, a tailpiece, a tag, an origin tag (i.e., an oligonucleotide
   including an origin sequence), or any other tag described herein (e.g., a library-identifying tag or a use tag).
                Any of the types of sequences described herein can be included in the headpiece. For example, the
 5 headpiece can include one or more of a building block sequence, a library-identifying sequence, a use sequence, or
   an origin sequence.
                Any of these sequences described herein can be included in a tailpiece. For example, the tailpiece can
   include one or more of a library-identifying sequence, a use sequence, or an origin sequence.
                Any of tags described herein can include a connector at or in proximity to the 5'- or 3'-terminus having a
10 fixed sequence. Connectors facilitate the formation of linkages (e.g., chemical linkages) by providing a reactive
   group (e.g., a chemical-reactive group or a photo-reactive group) or by providing a site for an agent that allows for a
   linkage (e.g., an agent of an intercalating moiety or a reversible reactive group in the connector(s) or cross-linking
   oligonucleotide). Each 5'-connector may be the same or different, and each 3'-connector may be the same or
   different. In an exemplary, non-limiting complex having more than one tags, each tag can include a 5'-connector
15 and a 3'-connector, where each 5'-connector has the same sequence and each 3'-connector has the same sequence
   (e.g., where the sequence of the 5'-connector can be the same or different from the sequence of the 3'-connector).
   The connector provides a sequence that can be used for one or more linkages. To allow for binding of a relay primer
   or for hybridizing a cross-linking oligonucleotide, the connector can include one or more functional groups allowing
   for a linkage (e.g., a linkage for which a polymerase has reduced ability to read or translocate through, such as a
20 chemical linkage).
                These sequences can include any modification described herein for oligonucleotides, such as one or more
   modifications that promote solubility in organic solvents (e.g., any described herein, such as for the headpiece), that
   provide an analog of the natural phosphodiester linkage (e.g., a phosphorothioate analog), or that provide one or
   more non-natural oligonucleotides (e.g., 2'-substituted nucleotides, such as 2'-O-methylated nucleotides and 2'
25 fluoro nucleotides, or any described herein).
                These sequences can include any characteristics described herein for oligonucleotides. For example, these
   sequences can be included in tag that is less than 20 nucleotides (e.g., as described herein). In other examples, the
   tags including one or more of these sequences have about the same mass (e.g., each tag has a mass that is about +/
   10% from the average mass between within a specific set of tags that encode a specific variable); lack a primer
30 binding (e.g., constant) region; lack a constant region; or have a constant region of reduced length (e.g., a length less
   than 30 nucleotides, less than 25 nucleotides, less than 20 nucleotides, less than 19 nucleotides, less than 18
   nucleotides, less than 17 nucleotides, less than 16 nucleotides, less than 15 nucleotides, less than 14 nucleotides, less
   than 13 nucleotides, less than 12 nucleotides, less than 11 nucleotides, less than 10 nucleotides, less than 9
   nucleotides, less than 8 nucleotides, or less than 7 nucleotides).
35              Sequencing strategies for libraries and oligonucleotides of this length may optionally include concatenation
   or catenation strategies to increase read fidelity or sequencing depth, respectively. In particular, the selection of
   encoded libraries that lack primer-binding regions has been described in the literature for SELEX, such as described
   in Jarosch et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 34: e86 (2006), which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, a
   library member can be modified (e.g., after a selection step) to include a first adapter sequence on the 5'-terminus of
40 the complex and a second adapter sequence on the 3'-terminus of the complex, where the first sequence is
   substantially complementary to the second sequence and result in forming a duplex. To further improve yield, two
                                                                 26
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090Al 11

   fixed dangling nucleotides (e.g., CC) are added to the 5'-terminus. In particular embodiments, the first adapter
   sequence is 5'-GTGCTGC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 1), and the second adapter sequence is 5'-GCAGCACCC-3' (SEQ ID
   NO: 2).
 5              Linkages
                The linkages of the invention are present between oligonucleotides that encode information (e.g., such as
   between the headpiece and a tag, between two tags, or between a tag and a tailpiece), where such linkages include
   any linkage for which a polymerase has reduced ability to read or translocate through. Exemplary linkages include
   chemical linkages including one or more of a chemical-reactive group, a photo-reactive group, an intercalating
10 moiety, a cross-linking oligonucleotide, or a reversible co-reactive group.
                A linkage may be tested to determine whether a polymerase has reduced ability to read or translocate
   through that linkage. This ability can be tested by any useful method, such as liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry, RT-PCR analysis, sequence demographics, and/or PCR analysis.
                In particular embodiments, chemical ligation includes the use of one or more chemical-reactive pairs to
15 provide a linkage. Exemplary chemical-reactive pairs are a pair including an optionally substituted alkynyl group
   and an optionally substituted azido group to form a triazole via a Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction; an
   optionally substituted diene having a 4 it-electron system (e.g., an optionally substituted 1,3-unsaturated compound,
   such as optionally substituted 1,3-butadiene, 1-methoxy-3-trimethylsilyloxy-1,3-butadiene, cyclopentadiene,
   cyclohexadiene, or furan) and an optionally substituted dienophile or an optionally substituted heterodienophile
20 having a 2 it-electron system (e.g., an optionally substituted alkenyl group or an optionally substituted alkynyl
   group) to form a cycloalkenyl via a Diels-Alder reaction; a nucleophile (e.g., an optionally substituted amine or an
   optionally substituted thiol) with a strained heterocyclyl electrophile (e.g., optionally substituted epoxide, aziridine,
   aziridinium ion, or episulfonium ion) to form a heteroalkyl via a ring opening reaction; a phosphorothioate group
   with an iodo group, such as in a splinted ligation of an oligonucleotide containing 5'-iodo dT with a 3'
25 phosphorothioate oligonucleotide; an optionally substituted amino group with an aldehyde group or a ketone group,
   such as a reaction of a 3'-aldehyde-modified oligonucleotide, which can optionally be obtained by oxidizing a
   commercially available 3'-glyceryl-modified oligonucleotide, with 5'-amino oligonucleotide (i.e., in a reductive
   amination reaction) or a 5'-hydrazido oligonucleotide; a pair of an optionally substituted amino group and a
   carboxylic acid group or a thiol group (e.g., with or without the use of succinimidyl trans-4
30 (maleimidylmethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
   (EDAC); a pair of an optionally substituted hydrazine and an aldehyde or a ketone group; a pair of an optionally
   substituted hydroxylamine and an aldehyde or a ketone group; or a pair of a nucleophile and an optionally
   substituted alkyl halide.
                Platinum complexes, alkylating agents, or furan-modified nucleotides can also be used as a chemical
35 reactive group to form inter- or intra-strand linkages. Such agents can be used between two oligonucleotides and
   can optionally be present in the cross-linking oligonucleotide.
                Exemplary, non-limiting platinum complexes include cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), e.g., to
   form GG intra-strand linkages), transplatin (trans-diaminedichloroplatinum(II), e.g., to form GXG inter-strand
   linkages, where X can be any nucleotide), carboplatin, picolatin (ZD0473), ormaplatin, or oxaliplatin to form, e.g.,
40 GC, CG, AG, or GG linkages. Any of these linkages can be inter- or intra-strand linkages.
                                                                27
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090At 11

                Exemplary, non-limiting alkylating agents include nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine, e.g., to form GG
   linkages), chlorambucil, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, prodrug forms of cyclophosphamide (e.g., 4
   hydroperoxycyclophosphamide and ifosfamide)), 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)- 1-nitrosourea (BCNU, carmustine), an
   aziridine (e.g., mitomycin C, triethylenemelamine, or triethylenethiophosphoramide (thio-tepa) to form GG or AG
 5 linkages), hexamethylmelamine, an alkyl sulfonate (e.g., busulphan to form GG linkages), or a nitrosourea (e.g., 2
   chloroethylnitrosourea to form GG or CG linkages, such as carmustine (BCNU), chlorozotocin, lomustine (CCNU),
   and semustine (methyl-CCNU)). Any of these linkages can be inter- or intra-strand linkages.
                Furan-modified nucleotides can also be used to form linkages. Upon in situ oxidation (e.g., with N
   bromosuccinimide (NBS)), the furan moiety forms a reactive oxo-enal derivative that reacts with a complementary
10 base to form an inter-strand linkage. In some embodiments, the furan-modified nucleotides forms linkages with a
   complementary A or C nucleotide. Exemplary, non-limiting furan-modified nucleotides include any 2'-(furan-2
   yl)propanoylamino-modified nucleotide; or an acyclic, modified nucleotides of 2-(furan-2-yl)ethyl glycol nucleic
   acid.
                Photo-reactive groups can also be used as a reactive group. Exemplary, non-limiting photo-reactive groups
15 include an intercalating moiety, a psoralen derivative (e.g., psoralen, HMT-psoralen, or 8-methoxypsoralen), an
   optionally substituted cyanovinylcarbazole group, an optionally substituted vinylcarbazole group, an optionally
   substituted cyanovinyl group, an optionally substituted acrylamide group, an optionally substituted diazirine group,
   an optionally substituted benzophenone (e.g., succinimidyl ester of 4-benzoylbenzoic acid or benzophenone
   isothiocyanate), an optionally substituted 5-(carboxy)vinyl-uridine group (e.g., 5-(carboxy)vinyl-2'-deoxyuridine),
20 or an optionally substituted azide group (e.g., an aryl azide or a halogenated aryl azide, such as succinimidyl ester of
   4-azido-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFB)).
                Intercalating moieties can also be used as a reactive group. Exemplary, non-limiting intercalating moieties
   include a psoralen derivative, an alkaloid derivative (e.g., berberine, palmatine, coralyne, sanguinarine (e.g.,
   iminium or alkanolamine forms thereof), or aristololactam-p-D-glucoside), an ethidium cation (e.g., ethidium
25 bromide), an acridine derivative (e.g., proflavine, acriflavine, or amsacrine), an anthracycline derivative (e.g.,
   doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin (daunomycin), idarubicin, and aclarubicin), or thalidomide.
                For a cross-linking oligonucleotide, any useful reactive group (e.g., described herein) can be used to form
   inter- or intra-strand linkages. Exemplary reactive groups include chemical-reactive group, a photo-reactive group,
   an intercalating moiety, and a reversible co-reactive group. Cross-linking agents for use with cross-linking
30 oligonucleotides include, without limitation, alkylating agents (e.g., as described herein), cisplatin (cis
   diamminedichloroplatinum(II)), trans-diaminedichloroplatinum(II), psoralen, HMT-psoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen,
   furan-modified nucleotides, 2-fluoro-deoxyinosine (2-F-dI), 5-bromo-deoxycytosine (5-Br-dC), 5-bromo
   deoxyuridine (5-Br-dU), 5-iodo-deoxycytosine (5-I-dC), 5-iodo-deoxyuridine (5-I-dU), succinimidyl trans-4
   (maleimidylmethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, SMCC, EDAC, or succinimidyl acetylthioacetate (SATA).
35              Oligonucleotides can also be modified to contain thiol moieties that can be reacted with a variety of thiol
   reactive groups such as maleimides, halogens, iodoacetamides and thus can be used for cross-linking two
   oligonucleotides. The thiol groups can be linked to the 5'- or the 3'- terminus of an oligonucleotide.
                For inter-strand cross-linking between duplex oligonucleotides at a pyrimidine (e.g., thymidine) position,
   the intercalating, photo-reactive moiety psoralen can be chosen. Psoralen intercalates into the duplex and forms
40 covalent inter-strand cross-links with pyrimidines, preferentially at 5'-TpA sites, upon irradiation with ultraviolet
   light (about 254 nm). The psoralen moiety can be covalently attached to a modified oligonucleotide (e.g., by an
                                                                  28

   alkane chain, such as a Cl-      1 o alkyl, or a polyethylene glycol group, such as as -(CH 2CH 2O).CH 2CH 2-, where n is an
   integer from 1 to 50). Exemplary psoralen derivatives can also be used, where non-limiting derivatives include 4'
   (hydroxyethoxymethy)-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (HMT-psoralen) and 8-methoxypsoralen.
                Various portions of the cross-linking oligonucleotide can be modified to introduce a linkage. For example,
 5 terminal phosphorothioates in oligonucleotides can also be used for linking two adjacent oligonucleotides.
   Halogenated uracils/cytosines can also be used as cross-linker modifications in the oligonucleotide. For example, 2
   fluoro-deoxyinosine (2-F-dI) modified oligonucleotides can be reacted with disulfide-containing diamines or
   thiopropylamines to form disulfide linkages.
                As described below, reversible co-reactive groups include those selected from a cyanovinylcarbazole
10 group, a cyanovinyl group, an acrylamide group, a thiol group, or a sulfonylethyl thioethers. An optionally
   substituted cyanovinylcarbazole (CNV) group can also be used in oligonucleotides to cross-link to a pyrimidine base
   (e.g., cytosine, thymine, and uracil, as well as modified bases thereof) in complementary strands. CNV groups
   promote [2+2] cycloaddition with the adjacent pyrimidine base upon irradiation at 366 nm, which results in an inter
   strand cross-link. Irradiation at 312 nm reverses the cross-link and thus provides a method for reversible cross
15 linking of oligonucleotide strands. A non-limiting CNV group is 3-cyanovinylcarbozaole, which can be included as
   a carboxyvinylcarbazole nucleotide (e.g., as 3-carboxyvinylcarbazole- l'-p-deoxyriboside-5'-triphosphate).
                The CNV group can be modified to replace the reactive cyano group with another reactive group to provide
   an optionally substituted vinylcarbazole group. Exemplary non-limiting reactive groups for a vinylcarbazole group
   include an amide group of -CONRNRN2, where each RNi and RN2 can be the same or different and is independently
20 H and C 1-6 alkyl, e.g., -CONH 2 ; a carboxyl group of -CO 2 H; or a C2-7 alkoxycarbonyl group (e.g., methoxycarbonyl).
   Furthermore, the reactive group can be located on the alpha or beta carbon of the vinyl group. Exemplary
   vinylcarbazole groups include a cyanovinylcarbazole group, as described herein; an amidovinylcarbazole group
   (e.g., an amidovinylcarbazole nucleotide, such as 3-amidovinylcarbazole-l'-p-deoxyriboside-5'-triphosphate); a
   carboxyvinylcarbazole group (e.g., a carboxyvinylcarbazole nucleotide, such as 3-carboxyvinylcarbazole-l'-p
25 deoxyriboside-5'-triphosphate); and a C2-7 alkoxycarbonylvinylcarbazole group (e.g., an
   alkoxycarbonylvinylcarbazole nucleotide, such as 3-methoxycarbonylvinylcarbazole-l'-p-deoxyriboside-5'
   triphosphate). Additional optionally substituted vinylcarbazole groups and nucleotides having such groups are
   provided in the chemical formulas of U.S. Patent No. 7,972,792 and Yoshimura and Fujimoto, Org. Lett. 10:3227
   3230 (2008), which are both hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.
30              Other reversible reactive groups include a thiol group and another thiol group to form a disulfide, as well as
   a thiol group and a vinyl sulfone group to form a sulfonylethyl thioethers. Thiol-thiol groups can optionally include
   a linkage formed by a reaction with bis-((N-iodoacetyl)piperazinyl)sulfonerhodamine. Other reversible reactive
   groups (e.g., such as some photo-reactive groups) include optionally substituted benzophenone groups. A non
   limiting example is benzophenone uracil (BPU), which can be used for site- and sequence-selective formation of an
35 interstrand cross-link of BPU-containing oligonucleotide duplexes. This cross-link can be reversed upon heating,
   providing a method for the reversible cross-linking of two oligonucleotide strands.
                In other embodiments, chemical ligation includes introducing an analog of the phosphodiester bond, e.g.,
   for post-selection PCR analysis and sequencing. Exemplary analogs of a phosphodiester include a phosphorothioate
   linkage (e.g., as introduced by use of a phosphorothioate group and a leaving group, such as an iodo group), a
40 phosphoramide linkage, or a phosphorodithioate linkage (e.g., as introduced by use of a phosphorodithioate group
   and a leaving group, such as an iodo group).
                                                                     29
   10163193 1 (CHMfteri P99090At 11

                For any of the groups described herein (e.g., a chemical-reactive group, a photo-reactive group, an
   intercalating moiety, a cross-linking oligonucleotide, or a reversible co-reactive group), the group can be
   incorporated at or in proximity to the terminus of an oligonucleotide or between the 5'- and 3'-termini.
   Furthermore, one or more groups can be present in each oligonucleotide. When pairs of reactive groups are
 5 required, then oligonucleotides can be designed to facilitate a reaction between the pair of groups. In the non
   limiting example of a cyanovinylcarbazole group that co-reacts with a pyrimidine base, the first oligonucleotide can
   be designed to include the cyanovinylcarbazole group at or in proximity to the 5'-terminus. In this example, a
   second oligonucleotide can be designed to be complementary to the first oligonucleotide and to include the co
   reactive pyrimidine base at a position that aligns with the cyanovinylcarbazole group when the first and second
10 oligonucleotide hybridizes. Any of the groups herein and any of the oligonucleotides having one or more groups
   can be designed to facilitate reaction between the groups to form one or more linkages.
                Bifunctional spacers
                The bifunctional spacer between the headpiece and the chemical entity can be varied to provide an
   appropriate spacing moiety and/or to increase the solubility of the headpiece in organic solvent. A wide variety of
15 spacers are commercially available that can couple the headpiece with the small molecule library. The spacer
   typically consists of linear or branched chains and may include a C1-10 alkyl, a heteroalkyl of 1 to 10 atoms, a C2-10
   alkenyl, a C 2 -o alkynyl, C5-o aryl, a cyclic or polycyclic system of 3 to 20 atoms, a phosphodiester, a peptide, an
   oligosaccharide, an oligonucleotide, an oligomer, a polymer, or a poly alkyl glycol (e.g., a poly ethylene glycol,
   such as -(CH 2CH 20).CH2 CH2 -, where n is an integer from 1 to 50), or combinations thereof.
20              The bifunctional spacer may provide an appropriate spacing moiety between the headpiece and a chemical
   entity of the library. In certain embodiments, the bifunctional spacer includes three parts. Part 1 may be a reactive
   group, which forms a covalent bond with DNA, such as, e.g., a carboxylic acid, preferably activated by a N-hydroxy
   succinimide (NHS) ester to react with an amino group on the DNA (e.g., amino-modified dT), an amidite to modify
   the 5' or 3'-terminus of a single-stranded headpiece (achieved by means of standard oligonucleotide chemistry),
25 chemical-reactive pairs (e.g., azido-alkyne cycloaddition in the presence of Cu(I) catalyst, or any described herein),
   or thiol reactive groups. Part 2 may also be a reactive group, which forms a covalent bond with the chemical entity,
   either building block An or a scaffold. Such a reactive group could be, e.g., an amine, a thiol, an azide, or an alkyne.
   Part 3 may be a chemically inert spacing moiety of variable length, introduced between Part 1 and 2. Such a spacing
   moiety can be a chain of ethylene glycol units (e.g., PEGs of different lengths), an alkane, an alkene, a polyene
30 chain, or a peptide chain. The spacer can contain branches or inserts with hydrophobic moieties (such as, e.g.,
   benzene rings) to improve solubility of the headpiece in organic solvents, as well as fluorescent moieties (e.g.
   fluorescein or Cy-3) used for library detection purposes. Hydrophobic residues in the headpiece design may be
   varied with the spacer design to facilitate library synthesis in organic solvents. For example, the headpiece and
   spacer combination is designed to have appropriate residues wherein the octanol:water coefficient (Po,,) is from, e.g.,
35 1.0 to 2.5.
                Spacers can be empirically selected for a given small molecule library design, such that the library can be
   synthesized in organic solvent, for example, in 15%, 25%, 30%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%, or 100% organic
   solvent. The spacer can be varied using model reactions prior to library synthesis to select the appropriate chain
   length that solubilizes the headpiece in an organic solvent. Exemplary spacers include those having increased alkyl
40 chain length, increased poly ethylene glycol units, branched species with positive charges (to neutralize the negative
                                                                 30
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090At 11

   phosphate charges on the headpiece), or increased amounts of hydrophobicity (for example, addition of benzene ring
   structures).
                Examples of commercially available spacers include amino-carboxylic spacers, such as those being
   peptides (e.g., Z-Gly-Gly-Gly-Osu (N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-(Glycine) 3 -N-succinimidyl ester) or Z-Gly-Gly
 5 Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Osu (N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-(Glycine) 6 -N-succinimidyl ester, SEQ ID NO: 3)), PEG (e.g.,
   Fmoc-aminoPEG2000-NHS or amino-PEG (12-24)-NHS), or alkane acid chains (e.g., Boc-c-aminocaproic acid
   Osu); chemical-reactive pair spacers, such as those chemical-reactive pairs described herein in combination with a
   peptide moiety (e.g., azidohomoalanine-Gly-Gly-Gly-OSu (SEQ ID NO: 4) or propargylglycine-Gly-Gly-Gly-OSu
   (SEQ ID NO: 5)), PEG (e.g., azido-PEG-NHS), or an alkane acid chain moiety (e.g., 5-azidopentanoic acid, (S)-2
10 (azidomethyl)- 1-Boc-pyrrolidine, 4-azidoaniline, or 4-azido-butan- 1-oic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester); thiol
   reactive spacers, such as those being PEG (e.g., SM(PEG)n NHS-PEG-maleimide), alkane chains (e.g., 3-(pyridin
   2-yldisulfanyl)-propionic acid-Osu or sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(3'-[2-pyridyldithio]-propionamido)hexanoate)); and
   amidites for oligonucleotide synthesis, such as amino modifiers (e.g., 6-(trifluoroacetylamino)-hexyl-(2
   cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)-phosphoramidite), thiol modifiers (e.g., S-trityl-6-mercaptohexyl-1-[(2-cyanoethyl)
15 (NN-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite, or chemical-reactive pair modifiers (e.g., 6-hexyn-1-yl-(2-cyanoethyl)-(NN
   diisopropyl)-phosphoramidite, 3-dimethoxytrityloxy-2-(3-(3-propargyloxypropanamido)propanamido)propyl-1-0
   succinoyl, long chain alkylamino CPG, or 4-azido-butan-1-oic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester)). Additional
   spacers are known in the art, and those that can be used during library synthesis include, but are not limited to, 5'-0
   dimethoxytrityl-l',2'-dideoxyribose-3'-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite;          9-0-dimethoxytrityl
20 triethylene glycol, 1-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite; 3-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityloxy)propyl-1-[(2
   cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite; and 18-0-dimethoxytrityl hexaethyleneglycol,1-[(2-cyanoethyl)
   (N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite. Any of the spacers herein can be added in tandem to one another in different
   combinations to generate spacers of different desired lengths.
                Spacers may also be branched, where branched spacers are well known in the art and examples can consist
25 of symmetric or asymmetric doublers or a symmetric trebler. See, for example, Newcome et al., Dendritic
   Molecules: Concepts, Synthesis, Perspectives, VCH Publishers (1996); Boussif et al., Proc.NatL. A cad. Sci. USA
   92:7297-7301 (1995); and Jansen et al., Science 266:1226 (1994).
   Enzymatic ligation and chemical ligation techniques
30              Various ligation techniques can be used to add scaffolds, building blocks, spacers, linkages, tags, and/or the
   headpiece to produce a complex. Accordingly, any of the binding steps described herein can include any useful
   ligation techniques, such as enzymatic ligation and/or chemical ligation. These binding steps can include the
   addition of one or more tags to the headpiece or complex; the addition of a spacer to the headpiece; and the addition
   of one or more scaffolds or building blocks to the headpiece or complex. In particular embodiments, the ligation
35 techniques used for any oligonucleotide provide a resultant product that can be transcribed and/or reverse
   transcribed to allow for decoding of the library or for template-dependent polymerization with one or more DNA or
   RNA polymerases.
                Generally, enzymatic ligation produces an oligonucleotide having a native phosphodiester bond that can be
   transcribed and/or reverse transcribed. Exemplary methods of enzyme ligation are provided herein and include the
40 use of one or more RNA or DNA ligases, such as T4 RNA ligase, T4 DNA ligase, CircLigase TM ssDNA ligase,
   CircLigase TM II ssDNA ligase, and ThermoPhage TM ssDNA ligase (Prokazyme Ltd., Reykjavik, Iceland).
                                                                31
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090Al 11

                Chemical ligation can also be used to produce oligonucleotides capable of being transcribed or reverse
   transcribed. The efficacy of a chemical ligation technique to provide oligonucleotides capable of being transcribed
   or reverse transcribed may need to be tested. This efficacy can be tested by any useful method, such as liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry, RT-PCR analysis, and/or PCR analysis. In particular embodiments, chemical
 5 ligation includes the use of one or more chemical-reactive pairs to provide a spacing moiety that can be transcribed
   or reverse transcribed. In particular, reactions suitable for chemical-reactive pairs are preferred candidates for the
   ligation process (Kolb et al., A ngew. Chem. Int. Ed., 40:2004-2021 (2001); Van der Eycken et al., QSAR Comb. Sci.,
   26:1115-1326 (2007)). In one embodiment, the ligated oligonucleotides contain a linkage that polymerases have a
   reduced ability to read or translocate through, e.g. an "unreadable" linkage.
10
                Reaction conditions to promote enzymatic ligation or chemical ligation
                The methods described herein can include one or more reaction conditions that promote enzymatic or
   chemical ligation between the headpiece and a tag or between two tags. These reaction conditions include using
   modified nucleotides within the tag, as described herein; using donor tags and acceptor tags having different lengths
15 and varying the concentration of the tags; using different types of ligases, as well as combinations thereof (e.g.,
   CircLigase TM DNA ligase and/or T4 RNA ligase), and varying their concentration; using poly ethylene glycols
   (PEGs) having different molecular weights and varying their concentration; use of non-PEG crowding agents (e.g.,
   betaine or bovine serum albumin); varying the temperature and duration for ligation; varying the concentration of
   various agents, including ATP, Co(NH 3)6 Cl 3, and yeast inorganic pyrophosphate; using enzymatically or chemically
20 phosphorylated oligonucleotide tags; using 3'-protected tags; and using preadenylated tags. These reaction
   conditions also include chemical ligations.
                The headpiece and/or tags can include one or more modified or substituted nucleotides. In preferred
   embodiments, the headpiece and/or tags include one or more modified or substituted nucleotides that promote
   enzymatic ligation, such as 2'-O-methyl nucleotides (e.g., 2'-O-methyl guanine or 2'-O-methyl uracil), 2'-fluoro
25 nucleotides, or any other modified nucleotides that are utilized as a substrate for ligation. Alternatively, the
   headpiece and/or tags are modified to include one or more chemically reactive groups to support chemical ligation
   (e.g. an optionally substituted alkynyl group and an optionally substituted azido group). Optionally, the tag
   oligonucleotides are functionalized at both termini with chemically reactive groups, and, optionally, one of these
   termini is protected, such that the groups may be addressed independently and side-reactions may be reduced (e.g.,
30 reduced polymerization side-reactions).
                Enzymatic ligation can include one or more ligases. Exemplary ligases include CircLigase TM ssDNA ligase
   (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies, Madison, WI), CircLigase T M II ssDNA ligase (also from EPICENTRE
   Biotechnologies), ThermoPhage TM ssDNA ligase (Prokazyme Ltd., Reykjavik, Iceland), T4 RNA ligase, and T4
   DNA ligase. In preferred embodiments, ligation includes the use of an RNA ligase or a combination of an RNA
35 ligase and a DNA ligase. Ligation can further include one or more soluble multivalent cations, such as
   Co(NH 3 )6 Cl 3 , in combination with one or more ligases.
                Before or after the ligation step, the complex can be purified for three reasons. First, the complex can be
   purified to remove unreacted headpiece or tags that may result in cross-reactions and introduce "noise" into the
   encoding process. Second, the complex can be purified to remove any reagents or unreacted starting material that
40 can inhibit or lower the ligation activity of a ligase. For example, phosphate may result in lowered ligation activity.
                                                                  32
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090Al 11

   Third, entities that are introduced into a chemical or ligation step may need to be removed to enable the subsequent
   chemical or ligation step. Methods of purifying the complex are described herein.
                Enzymatic and chemical ligation can include poly ethylene glycol having an average molecular weight of
   more than 300 Daltons (e.g., more than 600 Daltons, 3,000 Daltons, 4,000 Daltons, or 4,500 Daltons). In particular
 5 embodiments, the poly ethylene glycol has an average molecular weight from about 3,000 Daltons to 9,000 Daltons
   (e.g., from 3,000 Daltons to 8,000 Daltons, from 3,000 Daltons to 7,000 Daltons, from 3,000 Daltons to 6,000
   Daltons, and from 3,000 Daltons to 5,000 Daltons). In preferred embodiments, the poly ethylene glycol has an
   average molecular weight from about 3,000 Daltons to about 6,000 Daltons (e.g., from 3,300 Daltons to 4,500
   Daltons, from 3,300 Daltons to 5,000 Daltons, from 3,300 Daltons to 5,500 Daltons, from 3,300 Daltons to 6,000
10 Daltons, from 3,500 Daltons to 4,500 Daltons, from 3,500 Daltons to 5,000 Daltons, from 3,500 Daltons to 5,500
   Daltons, and from 3,500 Daltons to 6,000 Daltons, such as 4,600 Daltons). Poly ethylene glycol can be present in
   any useful amount, such as from about 25% (w/v) to about 35% (w/v), such as 30% (w/v).
                In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the tags are installed by ligation of a single-stranded
   oligonucleotide to a single-stranded oligonucleotide using the ligation protocol outlined below: Headpiece: 25 tM
15 (5' terminus: 5'-monophospho/2'-OMe G, intervening nucleotides: 2'-deoxy, and 3' terminus: 2'-blocked/3'
   blocked); Tag: 25 tM (5'-terminus: 2'-OMe/5'-OH G, intervening nucleotides: 2'-deoxy, and 3'-terminus: 3'
   OH/2'-OMe); Co(NH 3 )6 Cl 3 : 1 mM; PEG 4600: 30% (w/v); T4 RNA Ligase (Promega): 1.5 units/ptl; Yeast Inorganic
   Pyrophosphatase: 0.0025 units/pl; Tris: 50 mM; MgCl 2 : 10 mM; ATP: 1 mM; pH: 7.5; and Water: Balance.
   In further embodiments, the protocol includes incubation at 37"C for 20 hours. For the purposes of actual library
20 construction, higher concentration of headpiece, tags, and/or ligase may be used, and such modifications to these
   concentrations would be apparent to those skilled in the art. Chemical ligation methodologies can include any
   chemical method that enables the operative association of two encoding tags, whether or not a polymerase is able to
   read or translocate through the operatively-associated linkage.
25 Methods for determining the nucleotide sequence of a complex
                This invention features a method for determining the nucleotide sequence of a complex, such that encoding
   relationships may be established between the sequence of the tag and the structural units (or building blocks) of the
   chemical entity. In particular, the identity and/or history of a chemical entity can be inferred from the sequence of
   bases in the oligonucleotide. Using this method, a library including diverse chemical entities or members (e.g.,
30 small molecules or peptides) can be addressed with a particular tag sequence.
                Figures 1-4 provide various exemplary methods for determining the nucleotide sequence of a complex.
   These figures provide exemplary methods to span unreadable linkage and/or release cross-linking oligonucleotides,
   which result in the formation of an oligonucleotide template.
                Figure lb provides an exemplary method using relay primers. In particular, the relay primers hybridize to
35 the fixed constant sequence portions (e.g., the 5'- and 3'-connectors), where each sequence for the relay primers can
   be the same or different. The relay primers span the unreadable linkage, and extension proceeds along the readable
   portions of the complex (i.e., the encoding sequence, e.g., one or more tags) to produce oligonucleotide fragments.
   Then, the relay primers and fragments can be ligated to form a template, which can be optionally amplified and
   sequenced.
                                                                 33
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090At 11

                Figures 2-4 provide exemplary unreadable linkages. Figure 2 provides a linkage formed by psoralen,
   which reacts within a duplex formed by adjacent 5'- and 3'-connectors. Figure 3 provides a linkage formed by a
   cross-linked oligonucleotide, which hybridized to adjacent 5'- and 3'-connectors.
                Any of the linkages described herein can be reversible or irreversible. Reversible linkages include photo
 5 reactive linkages (e.g., a cyanovinylcarbozole group and thymidine, as in Figure 4) and redox linkages. Additional
   linkages are described herein.
                In an alternative embodiment, an "unreadable" linkage can be enzymatically repaired in order to generate a
   readable or at least translocatable linkage. Enzymatic repair processes are well known to those skilled in the art and
   include, but are not limited to, pyrimidine (e.g., thymidine) dimer repair mechanisms (e.g., using a photolyase or a
10 glycosylase (e.g., T4 pyrimidine dimer glycosylase (PDG))), base excision repair mechanisms (e.g., using a
   glycosylase, an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease, a Flap endonuclease, or a poly ADP ribose polymerase
   (e.g., human apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease, APE 1; endonuclease III (Nth) protein; endonuclease IV;
   endonuclease V; formamidopyrimidine [fapy]-DNA glycosylase (Fpg); human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (a
   isoform) (hOGGi); human endonuclease VIII-like 1 (hNEIL1); uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG); human single
15 strand selective monofunctional uracil DNA glycosylase (SMUG1); and human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase
   (hAAG)), which can be optionally combined with one or more endonucleases, DNA or RNA polymerases, and/or a
   ligases for the repair), methylation repair mechanisms (e.g., using a methyl guanine methyltransferase), AP repair
   mechanisms (e.g., using an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease (e.g., APE 1; endonuclease III; endonuclease
   IV; endonuclease V; Fpg; hOGG1; and hNEIL 1), which can be optionally combined with one or more
20 endonucleases, DNA or RNA polymerases, and/or a ligases for the repair), nucleotide excision repair mechanisms
   (e.g., using excision repair cross-complementing proteins or excision nucleases, which can be optionally combined
   with one or more endonucleases, DNA or RNA polymerases, and/or a ligases for the repair), and mismatch repair
   mechanisms (e.g., using an endonuclease (e.g., T7 endonuclease I; MutS, MutH, and/or MutL), which can be
   optionally combined with one or more exonucleases, endonucleases, helicases, DNA or RNA polymerases, and/or
25 ligases for the repair). Commercial enzyme mixtures are available to readily provide these kinds of repair
   mechanisms, e.g., PreCR Repair Mix (New England Biolabs Inc., Ipswich MA), which includes Taq DNA Ligase,
   Endonuclease IV, Bst DNA Polymerase, Fpg, Uracil-DNA Glycosylase (UDG), T4 PDG (14 Endonuclease V), and
   Endonuclease VIII.
30 Methods for tagging encoded libraries
                This invention features a method for operatively associating oligonucleotide tags with chemical entities,
   such that encoding relationships may be established between the sequence of the tag and the structural units (or
   building blocks) of the chemical entity. In particular, the identity and/or history of a chemical entity can be inferred
   from the sequence of bases in the oligonucleotide. Using this method, a library including diverse chemical entities
35 or members (e.g., small molecules or peptides) can be encoded with a particular tag sequence.
                Generally, these methods include the use of a headpiece, which has at least one functional group that may
   be elaborated chemically and at least one functional group to which a single-stranded oligonucleotide may be bound
   (or ligated). Binding can be effectuated by any useful means, such as by enzymatic binding (e.g., ligation with one
   or more of an RNA ligase and/or a DNA ligase) or by chemical binding (e.g., by a substitution reaction between two
40 functional groups, such as a nucleophile and a leaving group).
                                                                34
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090At 11

                To create numerous chemical entities within the library, a solution containing the headpiece can be divided
   into multiple aliquots and then placed into a multiplicity of physically separate compartments, such as the wells of a
   multiwell plate. Generally, this is the "split" step. Within each compartment or well, successive chemical reaction
   and ligation steps are performed with a single-stranded tag within each aliquot. The relationship between the
 5 chemical reaction conditions and the sequence of the single-stranded tag are recorded. The reaction and ligation
   steps may be performed in any order. Then, the reacted and ligated aliquots are combined or "pooled," and
   optionally purification may be performed at this point. These split and pool steps can be optionally repeated.
                Next, the library can be tested and/or selected for a particular characteristic or function, as described herein.
   For example, the mixture of tagged chemical entities can be separated into at least two populations, where the first
10 population binds to a particular biological target and the second population does not (e.g., by negative selection or
   positive selection). The first population can then be selectively captured (e.g., by eluting on a column providing the
   target of interest or by incubating the aliquot with the target of interest) and, optionally, further analyzed or tested,
   such as with optional washing, purification, negative selection, positive selection, or separation steps.
                Finally, the chemical histories of one or more members (or chemical entities) within the selected population
15 can be determined by the sequence of the operatively linked oligonucleotide. Upon correlating the sequence with
   the particular building block, this method can identify the individual members of the library with the selected
   characteristic (e.g., an increased tendency to bind to the target protein and thereby elicit a therapeutic effect). For
   further testing and optimization, candidate therapeutic compounds may then be prepared by synthesizing the
   identified library members with or without their associated oligonucleotide tags.
20              The methods described herein can include any number of optional steps to diversify the library or to
   interrogate the members of the library. For any tagging method described herein, successive "n" number of tags can
   be added with additional "n" number of ligation, separation, and/or phosphorylation steps. Exemplary optional steps
   include restriction of library member-associated encoding oligonucleotides using one or more restriction
   endonucleases; repair of the associated encoding oligonucleotides, e.g., with any repair enzyme, such as those
25 described herein; ligation of one or more adapter sequences to one or both of the termini for library member
   associated encoding oligonucleotides, e.g., such as one or more adapter sequences to provide a priming sequence for
   amplification and sequencing or to provide a label, such as biotin, for immobilization of the sequence; reverse
   transcription or transcription, optionally followed by reverse-transcription, of the assembled tags in the complex
   using a reverse transcriptase, transcriptase, or another template-dependent polymerase; amplification of the
30 assembled tags in the complex using, e.g., PCR; generation of clonal isolates of one or more populations of
   assembled tags in the complex, e.g., by use of bacterial transformation, emulsion formation, dilution, surface capture
   techniques, etc.; amplification of clonal isolates of one or more populations of assembled tag in the complex, e.g.,
   by using clonal isolates as templates for template-dependent polymerization of nucleotides; and sequence
   determination of clonal isolates of one or more populations of assembled tags in the complex, e.g., by using clonal
35 isolates as templates for template-dependent polymerization with fluorescently labeled nucleotides. Additional
   methods for amplifying and sequencing the oligonucleotide tags are described herein.
                These methods can be used to identify and discover any number of chemical entities with a particular
   characteristic or function, e.g., in a selection step. The desired characteristic or function may be used as the basis for
   partitioning the library into at least two parts with the concomitant enrichment of at least one of the members or
40 related members in the library with the desired function. In particular embodiments, the method comprises
   identifying a small drug-like library member that binds or inactivates a protein of therapeutic interest. In another
                                                                  35
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090At 11

   embodiment, a sequence of chemical reactions is designed, and a set of building blocks is chosen so that the reaction
   of the chosen building blocks under the defined chemical conditions will generate a combinatorial plurality of
   molecules (or a library of molecules), where one or more molecules may have utility as a therapeutic agent for a
   particular protein. For example, the chemical reactions and building blocks are chosen to create a library having
 5 structural groups commonly present in kinase inhibitors. In any of these instances, the oligonucleotide tags encode
   the chemical history of the library member and, in each case, a collection of chemical possibilities may be
   represented by any particular tag combination.
                In one embodiment, the library of chemical entities, or a portion thereof, is contacted with a biological
   target under conditions suitable for at least one member of the library to bind to the target, followed by removal of
10 library members that do not bind to the target, and analyzing the one or more oligonucleotide tags associated with
   the target. This method can optionally include amplifying the tags by methods known in the art. Exemplary
   biological targets include enzymes (e.g., kinases, phosphatases, methylases, demethylases, proteases, and DNA
   repair enzymes), proteins involved in protein:protein interactions (e.g., ligands for receptors), receptor targets (e.g.,
   GPCRs and RTKs), ion channels, bacteria, viruses, parasites, DNA, RNA, prions, and carbohydrates.
15              In another embodiment, the chemical entities that bind to a target are not subjected to amplification but are
   analyzed directly. Exemplary methods of analysis include microarray analysis, including evanescent resonance
   photonic crystal analysis; bead-based methods for deconvoluting tags (e.g., by using his-tags); label-free photonic
   crystal biosensor analysis (e.g., a BIND Reader from SRU Biosystems, Inc., Woburn, MA); or hybridization-based
   approaches (e.g. by using arrays of immobilized oligonucleotides complementary to sequences present in the library
20 of tags).
                In addition, chemical-reactive pairs (or functional groups) can be readily included in solid-phase
   oligonucleotide synthesis schemes and will support the efficient chemical ligation of oligonucleotides. In addition,
   the resultant ligated oligonucleotides can act as templates for template-dependent polymerization with one or more
   polymerases. Accordingly, any of the binding steps described herein for tagging encoded libraries can be modified
25 to include one or more of enzymatic ligation and/or chemical ligation techniques. Exemplary ligation techniques
   include enzyme ligation, such as use of one of more RNA ligases and/or DNA ligases; and chemical ligation, such
   as use of chemical-reactive pairs (e.g., a pair including optionally substituted alkynyl and azido functional groups).
                Furthermore, one or more libraries can be combined in a split-and-mix step. In order to permit mixing of
   two or more libraries, the library member may contain one or more library-identifying sequences, such as in a
30 library-identifying tag, in a ligated tag, or as part of the headpiece sequence, as described herein.
                Methods having reduced mass
                Much of the motivation for single-stranded encoding strategies arises from the reduced mass of a single
   stranded tag when compared to a double-stranded tag. Reduced mass potentially confers several benefits including
35 increased solubility, decreased cost, increased reactivity, increased target accessibility, decreased hydrodynamic
   radius, increased accuracy of analytical assessments, etc. In addition to using a single-stranded tagging
   methodology, further reductions in mass can be achieved by including the use of one or more of the following: one
   or more tags having a reduced length, constant mass tag sets, an encoding headpiece, one or more members of a
   library lacking a primer-binding region and/or a constant region, one or more members of a library having a reduced
40 constant region, or any other methodologies described herein.
                                                                  36
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090At 11

                To minimize the mass of the members in the library, the length of one or more tags can be reduced, such as
   to a length that is as short as possible to encode each split size. In particular, the tags can be less than 20 nucleotides
   (e.g., less than 19 nucleotides, less than 18 nucleotides, less than 17 nucleotides, less than 16 nucleotides, less than
   15 nucleotides, less than 14 nucleotides, less than 13 nucleotides, less than 12 nucleotides, less than 11 nucleotides,
 5 less than 10 nucleotides, less than 9 nucleotides, less than 8 nucleotides, or less than 7 nucleotides). As described
   below in the Examples, shorter tags (e.g, about 10 nucleotides or shorter) can be used for tag ligation.
                Constant mass strategies can also be used, which could aid in analysis during library synthesis. In addition,
   constant mass tag sets could permit the recognition of all single error occurences (e.g., errors arising from
   misreading a sequence or from chemical or enzymatic ligation of a tag) and most multiple error occurrences. The
10 relationship between the length of a constant mass single-stranded tag set and encoding ability (e.g., minimum
   lengths to support specific building block split sizes or library identities, etc.) is outlined below in Table 1.
   Accordingly, use of constant mass tag sets could be used to provide beneficial encoding ability, while maintaining
   error recognition during library formation.

                To minimize mass in the library, the headpiece can be used not only to link the chemical moiety and a tag
   but to also encode for the identity of a particular library or for a particular step. For example, the headpiece can
20 encode information, e.g., a plurality of headpieces that encode the first split(s) or the identity of the library, such as
   by using a particular sequence related to a specific library.
                                                                37
   10163193 1 (CHMfteri P99090All 1

                In addition, primer-binding (e.g., constant) regions from the library of DNA-encoded chemical entities can
   be excluded during the selection step(s). Then, these regions can be added after selection by, e.g., single-stranded
   ligation. One exemplary strategy would include providing a chemical entity at the 5'-terminus of a encoding
   oligonucleotide, selecting a particular chemical entity based on any useful particular characteristic or function, and
 5 ligating a tailpiece oligonucleotide to the 3'-terminus of the encoding oligonucleotide that includes a primer-binding
   sequence and may optionally contain one or more tags, e.g. a "use" tag, an "origin" tag, etc., as described herein.
   This primer-binding sequence could then be used to initiate template-dependent polymerization to generate cDNA
   (or cRNA) that is complementary to the selected library member. The cDNA or cRNA would then be ligated at its
   3'-terminus to an oligonucleotide that contains a primer-binding sequence and, now that the encoding information is
10 flanked on both sides by primer-binding sequences, the oligonucleotide may be sequenced and/or amplified using
   established approaches, such as any described herein.
                Mass may further be minimized by omitting or reducing the size of one or more constant sequences that
   separate encoding tags. Single-stranded ligation requires no complementary relationship between the ends to be
   ligated or between these ends and a splint. Therefore, no fixed sequence is required to support enzymatic ligation.
15 Short fixed regions between tags may be useful for informatic parsing of tags or other in silico deconvolution
   processes.
   Methods for encoding chemical entities within a library
                The methods of the invention can be used to synthesize a library having a diverse number of chemical
20 entities that are encoded by oligonucleotide tags. Examples of building blocks and encoding DNA tags are found in
   U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0224607, hereby incorporated by reference.
                Each chemical entity is formed from one or more building blocks and optionally a scaffold. The scaffold
   serves to provide one or more diversity nodes in a particular geometry (e.g., a triazine to provide three nodes
   spatially arranged around a heteroaryl ring or a linear geometry).
25              The building blocks and their encoding tags can be added directly or indirectly (e.g., via a spacer) to the
   headpiece to form a complex. When the headpiece includes a spacer, the building block or scaffold is added to the
   end of the spacer. When the spacer is absent, the building block can be added directly to the headpiece or the
   building block itself can include a spacer that reacts with a functional group of the headpiece. Exemplary spacers
   and headpieces are described herein.
30              The scaffold can be added in any useful way. For example, the scaffold can be added to the end of the
   spacer or the headpiece, and successive building blocks can be added to the available diversity nodes of the scaffold.
   In another example, building block An is first added to the spacer or the headpiece, and then the diversity node of
   scaffold S is reacted with a functional group in building block An. Oligonucleotide tags encoding a particular
   scaffold can optionally be added to the headpiece or the complex. For example, S. is added to the complex in n
35 reaction vessels, where n is an integer more than one, and tag S. (i.e., tag Si, S 2 , ... Sn-I, Sn) is bound to the
   functional group of the complex.
                Building blocks can be added in multiple, synthetic steps. For example, an aliquot of the headpiece,
   optionally having an attached spacer, is separated into n reaction vessels, where n is an integer of two or greater. In
   the first step, building block An is added to each n reaction vessel (i.e., building block A 1 , A 2 , ... An_1, An is added to
40 reaction vessel 1, 2, ... n-1, n), where n is an integer and each building block An is unique. In the second step,
   scaffold S is added to each reaction vessel to form an An-S complex. Optionally, scaffold S. can be added to each
                                                                  38
   10163193 1 (CHMftersi P99090At 11

   reaction vessel to from an An-Sn complex, where n is an integer of more than two, and each scaffold S. can be
   unique. In the third step, building block B. is to each n reaction vessel containing the An-S complex (i.e., building
   block B1 , B2 , ... Bn-i, Bn is added to reaction vessel 1, 2, ... n-1, n containing the A1 -S, A 2 -S, ... An.-S, An-S
   complex), where each building block Bn is unique. In further steps, building block C can be added to each n
 5 reaction vessel containing the Bn-An-S complex (i.e., building block C 1, C 2 , ... CenI, Cn is added to reaction vessel 1,
   2, ... n-1, n containing the B1-A 1 -S ... Bn-A.-S complex), where each building block C is unique. The resulting
   library will have n3 number of complexes having n3 tags. In this manner, additional synthetic steps can be used to
   bind additional building blocks to further diversify the library.
                After forming the library, the resultant complexes can optionally be purified and subjected to a
10 polymerization or ligation reaction, e.g., to a tailpiece. This general strategy can be expanded to include additional
   diversity nodes and building blocks (e.g., D, E, F, etc.). For example, the first diversity node is reacted with
   building blocks and/or S and encoded by an oligonucleotide tag. Then, additional building blocks are reacted with
   the resultant complex, and the subsequent diversity node is derivatized by additional building blocks, which is
   encoded by the primer used for the polymerization or ligation reaction
15              To form an encoded library, oligonucleotide tags are added to the complex after or before each synthetic
   step. For example, before or after the addition of building block An to each reaction vessel, tag An is bound to the
   functional group of the headpiece (i.e., tag A1 , A 2 , ... Ant, An is added to reaction vessel 1, 2, ... n-1, n containing
   the headpiece). Each tag An has a distinct sequence that correlates with each unique building block An, and
   determining the sequence of tag An provides the chemical structure of building block An. In this manner, additional
20 tags are used to encode for additional building blocks or additional scaffolds.
                Furthermore, the last tag added to the complex can either include a primer-binding sequence or provide a
   functional group to allow for binding (e.g., by ligation) of a primer-binding sequence. The primer-binding sequence
   can be used for amplifying and/or sequencing the oligonucleotides tags of the complex. Exemplary methods for
   amplifying and for sequencing include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), linear chain amplification (LCR), rolling
25 circle amplification (RCA), or any other method known in the art to amplify or determine nucleic acid sequences.
                Using these methods, large libraries can be formed having a large number of encoded chemical entities.
   For example, a headpiece is reacted with a spacer and building block An, which includes 1,000 different variants
   (i.e., n = 1,000). For each building block An, a DNA tag An is ligated or primer extended to the headpiece. These
   reactions may be performed in a 1,000-well plate or 10 x 100 well plates. All reactions may be pooled, optionally
30 purified, and split into a second set of plates. Next, the same procedure may be performed with building block Bn,
   which also include 1,000 different variants. A DNA tag Bn may be ligated to the An-headpiece complex, and all
   reactions may be pooled. The resultant library includes 1,000 x 1,000 combinations of An x Bn (i.e., 1,000,000
   compounds) tagged by 1,000,000 different combinations of tags. The same approach may be extended to add
   building blocks C., Dn, En, etc. The generated library may then be used to identify compounds that bind to the
35 target. The structure of the chemical entities that bind to the library can optionally be assessed by PCR and
   sequencing of the DNA tags to identify the compounds that were enriched.
                This method can be modified to avoid tagging after the addition of each building block or to avoid pooling
   (or mixing). For example, the method can be modified by adding building block An to n reaction vessels, where n is
   an integer of more than one, and adding the identical building block B1 to each reaction well. Here, B1 is identical
40 for each chemical entity, and, therefore, an oligonucleotide tag encoding this building block is not needed. After
   adding a building block, the complexes may be pooled or not pooled. For example, the library is not pooled
                                                                  39

   following the final step of building block addition, and the pools are screened individually to identify compound(s)
   that bind to a target. To avoid pooling all of the reactions after synthesis, a BIND Reader (from SRU Biosystems,
   Inc.), for example, may be used to monitor binding on a sensor surface in high throughput format (e.g., 384 well
   plates and 1,536 well plates). For example, building block A. may be encoded with DNA tag A., and building block
 5 B. may be encoded by its position within the well plate. Candidate compounds can then be identified by using a
   binding assay (e.g., using a BIND* Biosensor, also available by SRU Biosystems, Inc., or using an ELISA assay)
   and by analyzing the A. tags by sequencing, microarray analysis and/or restriction digest analysis. This analysis
   allows for the identification of combinations of building blocks A. and B. that produce the desired molecules.
                The method of amplifying can optionally include forming a water-in-oil emulsion to create a plurality of
10 aqueous microreactors. The reaction conditions (e.g., concentration of complex and size of microreactors) can be
   adjusted to provide, on average, a microreactor having at least one member of a library of compounds. Each
   microreactor can also contain the target, a single bead capable of binding to a complex or a portion of the complex
   (e.g., one or more tags) and/or binding the target, and an amplification reaction solution having one or more
   necessary reagents to perform nucleic acid amplification. After amplifying the tag in the microreactors, the
15 amplified copies of the tag will bind to the beads in the microreactors, and the coated beads can be identified by any
   useful method.
                Once the building blocks from the first library that bind to the target of interest have been identified, a
   second library may be prepared in an iterative fashion. For example, one or two additional nodes of diversity can be
   added, and the second library is created and sampled, as described herein. This process can be repeated as many
20 times as necessary to create molecules with desired molecular and pharmaceutical properties.
                Various ligation techniques can be used to add the scaffold, building blocks, spacers, linkages, and tags.
   Accordingly, any of the binding steps described herein can include any useful ligation technique or techniques.
   Exemplary ligation techniques include enzymatic ligation, such as use of one of more RNA ligases and/or DNA
   ligases, as described herein; and chemical ligation, such as use of chemical-reactive pairs, as described herein.

                                                 General strategy for complexes
                The complexes of the invention can be formed to include one or more linkages which a polymerase has
   reduced ability to read or translocate through. For example, complexes can be formed to include (from the 5' to 3'
30 direction) a chemical entity (star), a fixed constant sequence (e.g., a headpiece), followed by three variable encoding
   sequences (e.g., three tags), and another fixed constant sequence (e.g., a tailpiece), where the linkage between the
   fixed constant sequences and variable encoding sequences can be unreadable (Figure 1B).
                Unreadable linkages can be formed by any useful moiety or functional group. A non-limiting example is
   psoralen (Figure 2), which can form an unreadable linkage between the 5'- and 3'-connectors.
35              Unreadable linkages can be formed by a cross-linking oligonucleotide with a reversible co-reactive group
   of a cyanovinylcarbazole group. The complex can include (from the 5' to 3' direction) a chemical entity (star), a
   fixed constant sequence (e.g., a headpiece), a cross-linking oligonucleotide that is cross-linked via a reversible co
   reactive group of a cyanovinylcarbazole group (cross-linked at about 366 nm, marked with X), and followed by a
   variable encoding sequence having fixed constant sequences at the 5'- and 3'-termini (e.g., a tag having 5'- and 3'
40 connectors) (Figure 3). An exemplary reversible reaction with reversible co-reactive groups (a pair of a
   cyanovinylcarbazole group and a thymidine), which can be present in the 3'-connector, 5'-connector, and cross
                                                                  40

   linking oligonucleotide (Figure 4). Other unreadable linkages may be rendered deconvolutable by the use of repair
   enzyme(s).
                As part of the reading or deconvolution process, the complex can be reacted with a chemical process and/or
   an enzymatic process (e.g., a ligase and optionally a kinase) to ligate the tags. When the junction between adjacent
 5 tags is a nick, then ligase can be used to ligate the tags. Optionally, a kinase can be used to convert terminal 5'
   hydroxyl groups to phosphate groups. When the junction between adjacent tags is a gap requiring extension
   withone or more nucleotides, then a polymerase can be used to extend across the gap prior to the ligation of the tags
   (optionally including kinase). Optionally the polymerase has reduced strand-displacement activity. Next, the cross
   linking oligonucleotides are released to form a template (e.g., using irradiation at about 312 nm). Finally, the
10 template is optionally amplified with PCR and sequenced.
                For any of these complexes, each of the variable encoding sequences can optionally include a 5'-connector
   and a 3'-connector that are fixed constant sequences. Because the linkages are unreadable, relay primers can be
   used to span the linkages and to allow for extension with a polymerase, thus forming oligonucleotide fragments.
   The fragments can then be ligated using ligase, optionally amplified with PCR, and sequenced.
15              Alternatively encoding sequences on either side of an unreadable linkage may be copied into a single
   cDNA sequence using a recombination-mediated process in which recombination events are favored to occur for
   sequences derived from the same ancestral template sequence. This mechanism preserves tag association
   information and renders these associations deducible from derived sequence data. One possible method of
   generating unreadable linkages that may become templates for recombination-prone cDNA is to establish repeat
20 homologous regions either side of the linkage.
                                                            Example 2
           Photochemical oligonucleotide cross-linking using cyanovinyl carbazole to model one tagging event
                Oligonucleotide CNVKJ, containing two cyanovinyl carbazole modifications, was obtained from Nihon
25 Techno Service (Japan) (Figure 5). Oligonucleotides CNVK2_PTagB, CNVK2 NPTagB and CNVK2_TagA
   were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) (IA). Each oligonucleotide was dissolved in water to a
   concentration of 1 mM.
                Photochemical cross-linking conditions were as follows: Oligonucleotides CNVKJ, CNVK2_PTagB and
   CNVK2_TagA and were mixed at equimolar ratio at 100 uM each in 500 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 in 20 uL
30 or 50 uL aliquots in 1.5 mL natural color polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes (Fisher Scientific, 02-682-550).
   Each reaction was then was irradiated using a UVL-21 (4 Watt) lamp (95-0018-02) (Ultra Violet Products, CA) at
   365 nm for 2 hours at 40 C. The products of the reactions were then analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10%
   denaturing PAAG as well as by LCMS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (Figure 6). Over 70% of the starting material was
   converted into the photochemically cross-linked oligonucleotide conjugate with an observed MW of 16,894 Da
35 (calculated 16,890 Da). When the same cross-linking reaction was performed in 500 mM phosphate buffer at pH
   5.5 or 500 mM Borate buffer at pH 9.5 similar results and yields were observed.
                The photochemically cross-linked oligonucleotide conjugate of CNVK2_PTagB, CNVK2_TagA and
   CNVKJ was purified on a 10% denaturing PAAG and was un-crosslinked by heating at 80'C in 50 uL aliquots in
   1.5 mL natural color polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes (Fisher Scientific, 02-682-550) with irradiation (at 80'C)
40 using a Spectroline E-Series EB-160C (6 Watt) lamp (Spectronics Corp., NY) at 312 nm for 1 hour. The products
   were analyzed by LCMS. The reaction quantitatively yields unaltered starting oligonucleotide model tags
                                                                41

                In order to study the dissociation of multiple CNVK-containing cross-linked oligonucleotides, we adapted
   the above protocol to prepare a complex with two CNVK oligos, CNVKJ and Splint 14_CNVK, (Splint_14_CNVK

   complex was analyzed by LCMS: observed MW 25,079 Da (calculated 25,055 Da). Then it was dissolved in water
   to 100 uM concentration and was irradiated by UV 312 nm for 1 hour at 80'C, again as described above. The
10 products were analyzed by LCMS to find the recovery of the starting DoubleCNVKtemplate: observed MW
   16,492 Da (calculated 16,492 Da) (Figure 8).

                A complex of CNVK2_PTagB, CNVK2_TagA and CNVKJ was prepared, photochemically cross-linked,
   and gel-purified as described in Example 2.
                The photochemically cross-linked model tag pair was dissolved in 1x T4 DNA Ligase buffer (NEB, MA)
   and was incubated with T4 DNA ligase (NEB, MA) for 1 hour at 37'C. The product of this reaction was then
20 uncross-linked as described Example 2 and was analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and LCMS (Figure 9).
   The product of the ligation reaction was observed in high yield, observed MW 12,119 Da (calculated 12,119 Da).
                The corresponding photochemically cross-linked non-phosphorylated model tag pair CNVK2_NPTagB
   with CNVK2 TagA and CNVKJ was also prepared, as described above. The LCMS analysis of this complex
   revealed an observed MW of 16,503 Da (calculated 16,499 Da, Figure 10). The photochemically cross-linked
25 complex was dissolved in 1x T4 Ligase buffer (NEB) and was incubated with a mixture of T4 Polynucleotide
   Kinase and T4 DNA Ligase (NEB) for 1 hour at 37'C. The product of this coupled phosphorylation-ligation
   reaction was then photochemically uncross-linked by irradiation with UV at 312 nm for 1 hour at 80'C as described
   in Example 2. The product of this phosphorylation-ligation reaction was observed by denaturing gel electrophoresis
   and LCMS, revealing an observed MW of 11,894 Da (calculated MW 11,896 Da (additional phosphorylation at the
30 5' end of the ligated product)) (Figure 10).

                Oligonucleotide 5PSO2_A9_TA, modified with C2-Psoralen at the 5'-terminus was obtained from
35 Biosearch, CA (Figure 11). Oligonucleotide PSO_HP_A9_TCT was obtained from IDT (IA) (Figure 11). Both
   oligonucleotides were dissolved to 0.5 mM concentration each in 500 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and were
   annealed by heating to 95'C and subsequently cooling to room temperature. The reaction was then irradiated with
   UV light at 365 nm at 4'C using a UVL-21 compact UV lamp (UVP) for 30 minutes. The products were analyzed
   by LCMS. We observed rapid formation of the photochemically cross-linked product with an observed MW of
40 17,643 Da (calculated MW 17,643.4 Da, see Figure 12).

                          Photochemical oligonucleotide ligation using psoralen to model one tagging event
                Oligonucleotides Tagl PsoCVU and SplintC_PsoC2 were obtained from IDT (IA) (Figure 13).
   Oligonucleotide 5PSOC2_A9_GA (modified at 5'-terminus with C2 psoralen) was obtained from Biosearch (CA)
 5 (Figure 13).
                The photochemically ligated oligonucleotide conjugate of Tagl PsoCVU and 5PSOC2_A9_GA was
   prepared as follows. Photoligation is achieved by the photochemical reaction of the 5'-psoralen pyrone moiety of
   one oligonucleotide with the 3' thymidine of a second oligonucleotide in the presence of a third oligonucleotide
   designed to hybridize to both of the first and second oligonucleotides and co-locate their reactive termini (Figure
10 14).
                Photochemical ligation conditions were as follows: Oligonucleotides 5PsoC2_A9_GA (final 1 mM) and
   Tagl_PsoCVU (final 1.1 mM) and SplintC PsoC2 (final 1.1 mM) were combined in a 10 uL photoligation reaction
   in 500 mM Phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 in 1.5 mL natural color polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes (Fisher
   Scientific, 02-682-550). The reaction mixture was first heated to 95 0 C followed by slow cooling to room
15 temperature. The reaction was then irradiated with UV light at 365 nm at 4"C using a UVL-21 compact UV lamp
   (UVP). Aliquots of 1 uL were taken over a time-course and were analyzed on a 15% TBE/8M Urea denaturing
   polyacrylamide gel (Figure 15). The gel was visualized and photographed using the UV shadowing of a fluorescent
   TLC plate. The photoligated conjugate of 5PsoC2_A9_GA and Tag lPsoCVU formed at high yield. After 24
   hours the yield is approximately 90% (Figure 15).
20              The 24-hour sample was analyzed by LCMS (Figure 16). The major LC peak corresponded to the
   photoligated conjugate of 5PsoC2_A9_GA and TaglPsoCVU with an observed MW of 15,252.4 Da (calculated
   MW 15,243.1 Da).

                A Psoralen-Thymidine photochemically ligated oligonucleotide conjugate (Bio Pso) was generated using a
   method similar to that described in Example 5 with the following two model tag oligonucleotides: a 5'-biotinylated
30 oligonucleotide 5BioTag_PsoCVU and a 5'-Psoralen oligonucleotide 5PsoC2_A9_GA along with a splint
   oligonucleotide SplintC PsoC2, all three oligonucleotides were obtained from IDT (IA) and are shown in Figure 17.
   After 24 hrs of the reaction BioPso was purified on a 10% TBE-Urea denaturing PAAG and analyzed by LCMS,
   revealing a product with an observed MW of 15,834.0 Da (calculated MW 15,812.7 Da) (Figure 18).
                The Psoralen-Thymidine photochemically ligated oligonucleotide conjugate BioPso was used as a
35 template to generate cDNA by the enzymatic extension of both a terminal oligonucleotide primer (FAMprimer) and
   a non-terminal oligonucleotide primer (Phos-SplintCPsoC2) with T4 DNA polymerase (NEB, MA). Phos
   SplintCPsoC2 was generated by the 5'-phosphorylation of SplintCPsoC2 using T4 PNK (NEB, MA). The cDNA
   generation was conducted in a 100 uL reaction containing 10 uM each of FAMprimer, Phos-SplintCPsoC2 and
   BioPso in Ix T4 DNA ligase buffer (NEB, MA), supplemented with 1 mM of each dNTP and 10 uL of T4 DNA
40 polymerase (NEB, MA). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37"C for 1 hour and was then supplemented with
   0.5 mM ATP and 5 uL of T4 DNA ligase (2,000 u/ul, NEB, MA) and then incubated for another 1 hour at 37"C.

                The reaction mixture was then incubated with 200 uL of Streptavidin-coated DynaBeads M280 (Invitrogen,
   pre-washed with PBS for 1 hour at room temperature), the beads were washed with ImL of PBS and the product
   was eluted with 35 uL of 100 mM NaOH. The eluent was then neutralized by the addition of 5 uL of 1 M Tris HCl
   pH 7.0 and was analyzed by LCMS.
 5 LCMS analysis of the resultant product, with detection at 495nm, showed that approximately 50% of the
   FAMprimer had been extended to the full-length complementary sequence to the BioPso template minus a single
   dA nucleotide (observed MW 15,170 Da, expected full-length MW 15,458 Da). Most of the rest of the FAMprimer
   was extended up until the photochemical ligation junction (observed MW 11,154 Da, calculated MW 11,154 Da)
   (Figure 19).
10              When the cDNA-generation, described above, was performed without addition of the ligase enzyme, the
   full-length complementary sequence (minus a single dA) was not observed (Figure 20).

   Tagl_PsoCVU, SplintC CVU and SplintACVU were obtained from IDT DNA (IA) (Figure 21).
                The structure of the photochemical ligation junction formed between an irradiated 5'-5-(Carboxy)vinyl-2'

   natural color polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes (Fisher Scientific, 02-682-550). The reaction mixture was heated
   to 95"C followed by slow cooling to the room temperature. The reaction was then irradiated by UV light at 365 nm
   for 24 hours at 4"C using a UVL-21 compact UV lamp (UVP). Aliquots of 1 uL were taken over a time-course and
25 were electrophoresed on a 15% TBE/ 8M Urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Figure 23). The gel was visualized

   supplemented with 0.5 mM ATP and 5 uL of T4 DNA ligase (2,000 u/ul, NEB, MA) and then incubated for another
   1 hour at 37"C.
10              The reaction mixture was then incubated with 200 uL of Streptavidin-coated DynaBeads M280 (Invitrogen,
   pre-washed with PBS for 1 hour at room temperature), the beads were washed with ImL of PBS and the product
   was eluted with 35 ul of 100 mM NaOH. The eluent was then neutralized by the addition of 5 uL of 1 M Tris HCl
   pH 7.0 and was analyzed by LCMS.
                LCMS analysis of the resultant product, with detection at 495nm, showed that approximately 80% of the
15 FAMprimer had been extended to the full-length complementary sequence to the BioCVU template minus a single
   dA nucleotide (observed MW 15,176 Da, calculated full-length MW 15,458 Da). Most of the rest of the
   FAMprimer was extended up until three nucleotides before the photochemical ligation junction (observed MW
   10,560 Da, calculated MW 10,559 Da) (Figure 26).
                When the cDNA-generation, described above, was performed without addition of the ligase enzyme, the
20 full-length complementary sequence (minus a single dA) was not observed.

        Oligonucleotide ligation using a non-polymerase-readable click-conjugation to model one tagging event
                Oligonucleotides S_IDTN 3 and S IDTalkyne were obtained from IDT (IA) (Fig 27).
25 The 3'-azide modification of oligonucleotide SIDTN3 is an IDT proprietary modification (3' IDT azide
   modification /3AzideN/ (MW 350)).
                Oligonucleotides containing the /3AzideN/ modification were HPLC-purified.
                Oligonucleotides containing the Hexynyl modification were desalted and used without further purification.
                Click-conjugation of these model tags was achieved by a Cu (I) catalyzed 3+1 azido alkyne cycloaddition
30 as follows:
                Stock solutions were prepared as follows: Cu(OAc) 2 .H20 (FW 181.6), 10 mM in DMF; Sodium Ascorbate
   (FW 198.1), 20 mM in H 2 0 and Tris-(BenzylTriazolylmethyl)Amine (TBTA) (FW 530.6), 10 mM in DMF. To an
   Eppendorf tube was added 10 uL pH 7.0 phosphate buffer (500 mM aqueous solution), 10 uL of SIDTalkyne (1
   mM aqueous solution, 10 nmol, 1 equivalent) and 10 uL S-IDTN 3 (1 mM aqueous solution, 10 nmol, 1 molar
35 equivalent). To this solution was added 5 uL of CuPre-mix (2 molar equivalents of Cu(OAc) 2, 4 molar equivalents
   of sodium ascorbate, 1 molar equivalent of TBTA). The reaction was incubated at room temperature overnight. The
   product was analyzed by LCMS (Thermo) (Figure 28) and the MW was found to be 26,304.8 Da (calcd: 26311.2
   Da). The conjugate was further purified by electrophoresis using 10% PAAG/8M urea. This conjugation product
   was named ConjugateClickS.

                TKRCentral and and S_IDTN 3 oligos were obtained from IDT (Figure 29). The 5'-dibenzo-cyclooctyne
 5 (DBCO)-modified oligo TKR_DBCO_S was obtained from Biosearch Technologies (CA) (Figure 29).
                Firstly, a click conjugation was performed with TKRCentral and TKR_DBCO_S using a cyclooctyne
   based copper-free click reaction. Equal molar amounts of each oligonucleotide (10 uL of 1 mM aqueous solutions)
   were mixed together in 0.2M sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. The reaction progress was monitored by LCMS.
   The reaction was complete in 30 to 60 min, yielding over 90% of the pure conjugate. MS indicated a MW of 25,336
10 Da (calculated 25,341.8 Da) (Figure 30).
                Secondly, a click conjugation was performed between the conjugation product of TKRCentral and
   TKR_DBCO_S with S_IDTN 3 using the Cu (I) catalyzed click procedure described in Example 9. The resulting
   final conjugate, 2clS was purified on a 10% TBE/8M urea polyacrylamide gel and was analyzed by LCMS
   (Thermo) revealing the expected molecular weight for 2clS 38578.1 Da, (calculated 38560.4 Da) (Figure 31).

   confirmed the MW as 37,582.6 Da (calculated 37,584.4 Da).
                Oligodeoxynucleotide primers, including forward primer: TGCGGTCTAACTGTCTA, reverse primer:
   AAG CATAGCACCCGATT and ePsplint: GGCAATTCGGTACCTGTTCATTCC were obtained from (IDT, IA).
30              The conjugates Conjugate ClickL and ConjugateClickS were each diluted to 1 nM and were used as
   templates for a splint-dependent-recombination-mediated cDNA generation/PCR amplification using Deep Vent
   (exo-) DNA polymerase (NEB, MA). A 50 uL Deep Vent (exo-) reaction was prepared as follows: 5 uL of lOx
   Thermopol buffer; 2.5 uL of a 10 uM solution of each forward and reverse primer, 1 uL of 100 nM ePsplint primer;
   2.5 uL 10 mM dNTP mix (NEB); 5 uL of a 2 nM dilution of either conjugate or their 1:1 mixture, 2.5 uL Deep Vent
35 (exo-) and water to 50 uL. The reaction was cycled 24 times as follows: 30 seconds at 94'C, 30 seconds at 52'C
   and 60 seconds at 72 0 C.
                When ConjugateClickL or Conjugate Click S conjugates are amplified separately in free solution in the
   presence of both terminal primers and the splint primer "ePsplint" and then evaluated by electrophoresis, each gives
   rise to a single product of with a mobility that correlates with the length of the template (lanes 5 and 7 in Figure 33).
40 Similar amplifications in the absence of the splint primer "ePsplint" gave no product (lanes 4 and 6 in Figure 33).
   This suggests that splint-dependent-recombination-mediated cDNA generation/PCR amplification of both
                                                                   46

   conjugates by Deep Vent (exo-) polymerase is dependent on the presence of ePsplint primer (Figure 33). A possible
   mechanism for this recombination and amplification is presented in Figure 34.
                When both Conjugate ClickL and ConjugateClickS conjugates are mixed and amplified together in
   free solution in the presence of both terminal primers and the splint primer "ePsplint" and then evaluated by
 5 electrophoresis, a ladder of different-mobility products are generated with mobilities that correlate to the lengths of
   each of the templates as well as with mobilities that correlate to lengths intermediate between each of the templates
   (lane 5 in Figure 35). A possible mechanism for this recombination and amplification is presented in Figure 36.
                When both Conjugate ClickL and ConjugateClickS conjugates are mixed and amplified together in a
   water-in-oil emulsion in the presence of both terminal primers and the splint primer "ePsplint" at low concentration
10 of conjugates relative to emulsion droplets, and then evaluated by electrophoresis, a pair of products are observed
   with mobilities that correlate to the lengths of each of the templates (lane 3 in Figure 37). Droplets of the emulsion
   act as individual microreactors, within which isolated individual conjugates are amplified. The oil/surfactant phase
   was prepared by mixing 4.5% (vol/vol) of Span 80 (Fluka, cat#85548), 0.4% (vol/vol) of Tween 80 (Sigma, cat#S
   8074) and 0.05% (vol/vol) of Triton X-100 (Sigma, cat# T-9284) in light mineral oil (Sigma, cat# M-3516). The
15 aqueous phase (50 uL) was made by mixing 5 uL of lOx Thermopol buffer; 2.5 uL of a solution of each 10 uM
   primer, 1 uL of 100 nM ePsplint primer; 2.5 uL 10 mM dNTP mix (NEB); 2.5 uL DVexo- (NEB), 2.5 uL of BSA
   (NEB) and water to 50 uL. A 1:1 mixture of the conjugates ConjugateClickL and Conjugate ClickS were added
   to the reaction to a final concentration of 5 pM. To 50 uL of the aqueous phase, 150 uL of the non-aqueous phase
   was then added and emulsification was performed by vortexing for 5 minutes. The recombination/amplification
20 process was conducted as follows: 30 seconds at 94 0 C, 30 seconds at 520 C and 60 seconds at 72 0 C for 32 cycles.
                Following the splint-dependent-recombination-mediated cDNA generation/PCR amplification, the
   emulsion was broken by microcentrifugation at 21,000g for 20 minutes, then the non-aqueous phase was removed
   and the aqueous phase and interphase were extracted into chloroform. The aqueous phase was then evaluated by
   native electrophoresis (4% agarose minigels, Invitrogen CA).
25              The results of the emulsion-compartmentalized splint-dependent-recombination-mediated cDNA
   generation/PCR amplification show that the extent of formation of shuffled PCR products is significantly
   diminished or nonexistent (Lane 3, Figure 37).

                Two conjugates, TKRS and TKRL (Figure 38), each containing a single non-polymerase-readable click
   conjugation linkage formed between a 3'-azido-modified-oligonucleotide and a 5'-hexynyl-modified
   oligonucleotide using Cu(I) catalyzed cycloaddition and the protocol described in Example 9. TKRS and TKR-L
35 each contain a duplicated 12-mer GGAATGAACAGG sequence that flanks the non-polymerase-readable linkage.
   TKRS was prepared by conjugating the following two IDT DNA oligonucleotides, TKR_S_N 3 :

   molecular weights for TKR_S: 26,447.5 Da (26,449.2 Da calculated), and for TKRL 37,582.6 Da (37,584.4

 5              The two conjugates were each diluted to 1 nM and were used for a repeat-dependent-recombination
   mediated cDNA generation/PCR amplification with Deep Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase (NEB) in free solution with
   the forward primer TGCGGTCTAACTGTCTA and the reverse primer AAGCATAGCACCCGATT (IDT).
                The repeat-dependent-recombination-mediated cDNA generation/PCR amplification reaction was
   performed using Deep Vent (exo-) DNA polymerase (NEB). 5 uL of lOx Thermopol buffer; 2.5 uL of a 10 uM
10 solution of each forward and reverse primer; 2.5 uL 10 mM dNTP mix (NEB); 40 pM final concentration of either
   conjugate or their 1:1 mixture, 2.5 uL Deep Vent (exo-) Polymerase and water to a final volume of 50 uL. The
   reaction was thermally cycled 22 times as follows: 30 seconds at 94 0 C, 30 seconds at 520 C and 60 seconds at 72 0 C.
                The products were visualized on a 4% agarose minigel (Invitrogen) (Figure 39).
                The Deep Vent (exo-) Polymerase repeat-dependent-recombination-mediated cDNA generation/PCR
15 amplification reaction produced large amounts of amplicon derived from each separately amplified conjugate (Lanes
   3 and 4, Figure 39). Amplification of the mixture of the conjugates under the same conditions did not result in the
   production of any intermediate-length amplification products (Lane 5, Figure 39). To further confirm the lack of
   shuffling (loss) of tag associations (encoded information) in these amplification products, we cloned and sequenced
   the amplification products derived from the co-amplified mixture of TKRS and TKRL. These sequence data
20 confirmed the complete lack of shuffling of the model tag pairs in the amplification products derived from the co
   amplified conjugates (Figure 40).

                Two conjugates, 2_clS and 2_clL (Figure 41), each containing two unreadable click conjugation
   linkages, each flanked by different 12-mer repeat sequences (GAAGGCGTTATG-click-GAAGGCGTTATG) and
   (GGAATGAACAGG-click-GGAATGAACAGG),                     respectively, were prepared in a two-step procedure similar to
   that described in Example 10.

   TKRcentral: /5'-Hexynyl/GGAATGAACAGGGTAAGCTGGAGTGAAGGCGTTATG/3azideN/                                  (IDT) and either

   . Both DBCO-containing oligonucleotides were obtained from Biosearch (CA), DBCO is the 5'-dibenzo
35 cyclooctyne modification for which the phosphoramidite reagent is available from Glen Research (VA)). The
   products of these conjugations were named TKR_SN          3 and TKR_L_N 3 respectively.
                Secondly, a conjugation was performed between the products of the first conjugations, TKRS_N3 and
   TKR_L_N 3, using a Cu (I) catalyzed click reaction. The resulting conjugates, TKR_2_clickS and TKR_2_click_L
   (Figure 41) were purified using electrophoresis on a 10% TBE/8M urea polyacrylamide gel and were analyzed by

                The two conjugates were each diluted to 1 nM and were used for a repeat-dependent-recombination
   mediated cDNA generation/PCR amplification with Deep Vent (exo-) Polymerase (NEB). For amplification the
   forward primer TGCGGTCTAACTGTCTA and the reverse primer AAGCATAGCACCCGATT (IDT DNA) were
   used with 5 uL of 1Ox Thermopol buffer; 2.5 uL of a 10 uM solution of each forward and reverse primer; 2.5 uL 10

10 amplification reaction produced large amounts of amplicon derived from each separately amplified conjugate (Lanes
