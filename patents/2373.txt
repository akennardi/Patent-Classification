CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] This application is a divisional application from Australian patent application no.
2014308596 filed on 22 August 2014, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent
Application No. 61/868,633, entitled "Processes for Preparing Color Stable Manganese
Doped Phosphors", filed August 22, 2013, which is herein incorporated in its entirety by
reference for all purposes.
BACKGROUND
[0002] Red-emitting phosphors based on complex fluoride materials activated by Mn4+ can
be utilized in combination with yellow/green emitting phosphors such as YAG:Ce or other
garnet compositions to achieve warm white light (CCTs<5000 K on the blackbody locus,
color rendering index (CRI) >80) from a blue LED, equivalent to that produced by current
fluorescent, incandescent and halogen lamps. These materials absorb blue light strongly
and efficiently emit between about 610-635 nm with little deep red/NIR emission. Therefore,
luminous efficacy is maximized compared to red phosphors that have significant emission in
the deeper red where eye sensitivity is poor. Quantum efficiency can exceed 85% under
blue (440-460 nm) excitation.
[0003] While the efficacy and CRI of lighting systems using Mn 4 * doped fluoride hosts can
be quite high, many of these materials exhibit some instability in high temperature, high
humidity environments and this may limit their use in commercial systems requiring long
term stability under operating conditions. US 8,252,613 describes a process that can reduce
this degradation by post-synthesis treatment with an aqueous hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution
of a hexafluorosilicate salt. However, toxicity of HF is a significant consideration, and
alternatives that can maintain the improvement in stability of the materials while reducing the
amount or concentration of HF in the treatment solution are desirable.

phosphor of formula 1.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0013] In one aspect, the present invention relates to low-HF or HF-free processes for
improving color stability of a Mn* 4 doped phosphor of formula 1. The processes include
contacting the phosphor of formula I with a solution that contains hexafluorosilicic acid, and
isolating a treated phosphor of formula I having improved color stability relative to an
untreated phosphor of formula 1. The solution additionally contains water, and may contain a
salt of formula Ax [MFy], for example, K2 SiF 6 . In some embodiments, the solution is HF-free,
that is, contains less than 1% HF.          In other embodiments, the solution is low-HF in
comparison to the process of US 8,252,613, as some of the HF of that process is replaced
by hexafluorosilicic acid. The amount of HF replaced ranges from about 25% to about 100%
by weight percent. Where the solution contains HF, it may also contain the salt of formula Ax
[MFy].
[0014] Mn* 4 doped phosphors of formula I are disclosed in US 3,576,756, US 7,497,973 and
US 7,648,649, and GB 1360690.             The phosphors of formula I may be described as
Mn 4*-activated   complex      fluoride  compounds      or   materials,  or   more   specifically,
Mn 4*-activated complex      metal or metalloid fluoride compounds or materials.             The
compounds include a coordination compound containing at least one coordination center
surrounded by fluoride ions acting as ligands, and charge-compensated by counter ions as
necessary. In one example, K2SiF6:Mn**, the coordination center is Si and the counterion is
K. The Mn 4 ' activator ion substitutes for some of the atoms of the centers of the host lattice,
Si in the example of K2SiF6:Mn 4 *, and also acts as a coordination center. The host lattice
(including the counter ions) may further modify the excitation and emission properties of the
activator ion.
[0015] The coordination center of the phosphor of formula I, that is, M in formula I, may be
Si, Ge, Sn, Ti, Zr, Al, Ga, In, Sc, Y, La, Nb, Ta, Bi, Gd, or a combination thereof. Si, In
particular embodiments, the coordination center may be Ge, Sn, Ti, Zr, or a combination
thereof. More particularly, the coordination center may be Si, Ge, Ti, or a combination
thereof, and the counterion, or A in formula I, is Na, K, Rb, Cs, or a combination thereof, and
                                                -3-

y is 6. Examples of phosphors of formula I include K2 [SiF 6 ]:Mn**, K2 [TiF 6]:Mn**,
K2 [SnF 6]:Mn**, Cs 2 [TiF 6], Rb 2[TiF 6], Cs 2 [SiF 6], Rb 2 [SiF 6 ], Na 2[TiF 6 ]:Mn**, Na 2 [ZrF6 ]:Mn**,
K3 [ZrF 7]:Mn**, K3 [BiF 6 ]:Mn**, K3[YF6]:Mn**, K3 [LaF6 ]:Mn**, K3[GdF6 ]:Mn**, K3[NbF 7]:Mn**,
K3 [TaF 7]:Mn**. In particular embodiments, the phosphor of formula I is K2SiF 6 :Mn**.
[0016] The amount of manganese in the Mn 4 * doped phosphors typically ranges from about
0.4 weight% to about 0.9 weight%, based on total weight of the color stable phosphor In
particular embodiments, where the phosphor is K2SiF:Mn**, the amount of Mn ranges from
about 0.53 wt% to about 0.76 wt%, more particularly from about 0.65 wt% to about 0.7 wt%.
[0017] In the processes of the present invention, temperature at which the phosphor in
particulate form is contacted with the solution is not critical, and may range from about 200C
to about 700C, although higher and lower temperatures may be used if desired. Likewise,
the period of time required to produce a color stable phosphor typically ranges from about
one minute to about five hours, particularly from about five minutes to about one hour, but
other times may also be used.
[0018] In addition to the treatment with aqueous acid, the phosphor of formula I may be also
annealed, or subjected to an elevated temperature, while in contact with an atmosphere
containing a fluorine-containing oxidizing agent. The phosphor may be annealed before or
after the treatment; and may be treated multiple times, if desired. Where the phosphor is
annealed before the treatment, impurities introduced during the annealing process may be
removed by the treatment.           The fluorine-containing oxidizing agent may be F2, HF, BrF 5 ,
NH 4 HF2, NH 4F, KF, AIF 3 , SbF5 , CIF 3 , BrF 3 SbF 5 ,KrF, XeF 2 , XeF 4 , NF3 or a combination
thereof, particularly F2 . The amount of oxidizing agent in the atmosphere may be varied to
obtain the color stable phosphor, particularly in conjunction with variation of time and
temperature.     Where the fluorine-containing oxidizing agent is F2 , the atmosphere may
include at least 0.5% F2, although a lower concentration may be effective in some
embodiments. In particular the atmosphere may include at least 5% F2 , more particularly, at
least 20% F2, and even more particularly, at least 35% F2. The atmosphere may additionally
include nitrogen, helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, in any combination with fluorine gas.
In particular embodiments, the atmosphere is composed of about 20% F2 and about 80%
nitrogen.
[0019] The temperature at which the phosphor is contacted with the fluorine-containing
oxidizing agent may range from about 2000C to about 5300C, particularly from about 3500C
to about 5000C.       during contact.        In various embodiments of the present invention, the
                                                        -4-

temperature is at least 1000C, particularly about 4000C, and more particularly about 4750C.
The phosphor is contacted with the oxidizing agent for a period of time sufficient to convert it
to a color stable phosphor. Time and temperature are interrelated, and may be adjusted
together, for example, increasing time while reducing temperature, or increasing temperature
while reducing time.
[0020] A lighting apparatus or light emitting assembly or lamp 10 according to one
embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 1. Lighting apparatus 10 includes a
semiconductor radiation source, shown as light emitting diode (LED) chip 12, and leads 14
electrically attached to the LED chip. The leads 14 may be thin wires supported by a thicker
lead frame(s) 16 or the leads may be self supported electrodes and the lead frame may be
omitted. The leads 14 provide current to LED chip 12 and thus cause it to emit radiation.
[0021] The lamp may include any semiconductor blue or UV light source that is capable of
producing white light when its emitted radiation is directed onto the phosphor.         In one
embodiment, the semiconductor light source is a blue emitting LED doped with various
impurities. Thus, the LED may comprise a semiconductor diode based on any suitable III-V,
1l-VI or IV-IV semiconductor layers and having an emission wavelength of about 250 to 550
nm. In particular, the LED may contain at least one semiconductor layer comprising GaN,
ZnSe or SiC.      For example, the LED may comprise a nitride compound semiconductor
represented by the formula IniGaAlkN (where Osi; Oj; Osk and I +         j + k =1) having an
emission wavelength greater than about 250 nm and less than about 550 nm. In particular
embodiments, the chip is a near-uv or blue emitting LED having a peak emission wavelength
from about 400 to about 500 nm.         Such LED semiconductors are known in the art. The
radiation source is described herein as an LED for convenience. However, as used herein,
the term is meant to encompass all semiconductor radiation sources including, e.g.,
semiconductor laser diodes.        Further, although the general discussion of the exemplary
structures of the invention discussed herein is directed toward inorganic LED based light
sources, it should be understood that the LED chip may be replaced by another radiation
source unless otherwise noted and that any reference to semiconductor, semiconductor
LED, or LED chip is merely representative of any appropriate radiation source, including, but
not limited to, organic light emitting diodes.
[0022] The LED chip 12 may be encapsulated within a shell 18, which encloses the LED
chip and an encapsulant material 20. The shell 18 may be, for example, glass or plastic.
Preferably, the LED 12 is substantially centered in the encapsulant 20. The encapsulant 20
                                                -5-

is preferably an epoxy, plastic, low temperature glass, polymer, thermoplastic, thermoset
material, resin or other type of LED encapsulating material as is known in the art. Optionally,
the encapsulant 20 is a spin-on glass or some other high index of refraction material.
Preferably, the encapsulant material 20 is an epoxy or a polymer material, such as silicone.
Both the shell 18 and the encapsulant 20 are preferably transparent or substantially optically
transmissive with respect to the wavelength of light produced by the LED chip 12 and
phosphor blend 22, which contains a Mn 4 doped phosphor according to the present
invention. Alternately, the lamp may 10 may only comprise an encapsulant material without
an outer shell 18. The LED chip 12 may be supported, for example, by the lead frame 16, by
the self supporting electrodes, the bottom of the shell 18, or by a pedestal (not shown)
mounted to the shell or to the lead frame.         In some embodiments, the LED chip 12 is
mounted in a reflective cup (not shown).        The cup may be made from or coated with a
reflective material, such as alumina, titania, or other dielectric powder known in the art,
particularly alumina.
[0023] Lighting apparatus 10 includes phosphor blend 22, radiationally coupled to the LED
chip 12. Radiationally coupled means that the elements are associated with each other so
radiation from one is transmitted to the other. Phosphor blend 22 is deposited on the LED
12 by any appropriate method. For example, a water based suspension of the phosphor(s)
can be formed, and applied as a phosphor layer to the LED surface. In one such method, a
silicone slurry in which the phosphor particles are randomly suspended is placed around the
LED. This method is merely exemplary of possible positions of phosphor blend 22 and LED
12. Thus, phosphor blend 22 may be coated over or directly on the light emitting surface of
the LED chip 12 by coating and drying the phosphor suspension over the LED chip 12. Both
the shell 18 and the encapsulant 20 should be transparent to allow white light 24 to be
transmitted through those elements.         Although not intended to be limiting, in some
embodiments, the median particle size of the phosphor composition ranges from about 1 to
about 25 microns, particularly from about 15 to about 20 microns.
[0024] In other embodiments, phosphor blend 22 is interspersed within the encapsulant
material 20, instead of being formed directly on the LED chip 12. The phosphor (in the form
of a powder) may be interspersed within a single region of the encapsulant material 20 or,
more preferably, throughout the entire volume of the encapsulant material.          Blue light
emitted by the LED chip 12 mixes with the light emitted by phosphor blend 22, and the mixed
light appears as white light.    If the phosphor is to be interspersed within the material of
encapsulant 20, then a phosphor powder may be added to a polymer precursor, loaded
                                               -6-

around the LED chip 12, and then the polymer precursor may be cured to solidify the
polymer material. Other known phosphor interspersion methods may also be used, such as
transfer loading.
[0025] In yet another embodiment, phosphor blend 22 is coated onto a surface of the shell
18, instead of being formed over the LED chip 12. The phosphor composition is preferably
coated on the inside surface of the shell 18, although the phosphor may be coated on the
outside surface of the shell, if desired. Phosphor blend 22 may be coated on the entire
surface of the shell or only a top portion of the surface of the shell. The UV/blue light emitted
by the LED chip 12 mixes with the light emitted by phosphor blend 22, and the mixed light
appears as white light. Of course, the phosphor may be located in any two or all three
locations or in any other suitable location, such as separately from the shell or integrated into
the LED.
[0026]     FIG. 2 illustrates a second structure of the system according to the present
invention.   Corresponding numbers from FIGS. 1-4 (e.g. 12 in FIG. 1 and 112 in FIG. 2)
relate to corresponding structures in each of the figures, unless otherwise stated.          The
structure of the embodiment of FIG. 2 is similar to that of FIG. 1, except that the phosphor
material 122 is interspersed within the encapsulant material 120, instead of being formed
directly on the LED chip 112. The phosphor (in the form of a powder) may be interspersed
within a single region of the encapsulant material or, more preferably, throughout the entire
volume of the encapsulant material. Radiation (indicated by arrow 126) emitted by the LED
chip 112 mixes with the light emitted by the phosphor 122, and the mixed light appears as
white light 124. If the phosphor is to be interspersed within the encapsulant material 120,
then a phosphor powder may be added to a polymer precursor, and loaded around the LED
chip 112. The polymer precursor may then be cured to solidify the polymer. Other known
phosphor interspersion methods may also be used, such as transfer molding.
[0027]     FIG. 3 illustrates a third possible structure of the system according to the present
invention.   The structure of the embodiment shown in FIG. 3 is similar to that of FIG. 1,
except that the phosphor material 222 is coated onto a surface of the envelope 218, instead
of being formed over the LED chip 212. The phosphor material 222 is preferably coated on
the inside surface of the envelope 218, although the phosphor may be coated on the outside
surface of the envelope, if desired. The phosphor 222 may be coated on the entire surface
of the envelope, or only a top portion of the surface of the envelope. The radiation 226
emitted by the LED chip 212 mixes with the light emitted by the phosphor 222, and the
                                                -7-

mixed light appears as white light 224.        Of course, the structures of FIGS. 1-3 may be
combined, and the phosphor may be located in any two or all three locations, or in any other
suitable location, such as separately from the envelope, or integrated into the LED.
[0028]      In any of the above structures, the lamp 10 {as exemplified in FIG. 1) may also
include a plurality of scattering particles (not shown), which are embedded in the
encapsulant material.      The scattering particles may comprise, for example, alumina or
titania. The scattering particles effectively scatter the directional light emitted from the LED
chip, preferably with a negligible amount of absorption.
[0029]      As shown in a fourth structure in FIG. 4, the LED chip 412 may be mounted in a
reflective cup 430. The cup 430 may be made from or coated with a reflective material, such
as alumina, titania, or other dielectric powders known in the art, particularly alumina. The
remainder of the structure of the embodiment of FIG. 4 is the same as those of any of the
previous figures, and can include two leads 416, a conducting wire 432, and an encapsulant
material 420. The reflective cup 430 is supported by the first lead 416 and the conducting
wire 432 is used to electrically connect the LED chip 412 with the second lead 416.
[0030]      Another structure (particularly for backlight applications) is a surface mounted
device ("SMD") type light emitting diode 550, e.g. as illustrated in FIG. 5. This SMD is a
"side-emitting type" and has a light-emitting window 552 on a protruding portion of a light
guiding member 554. The SMD type light emitting diodes 550 can be made by disposing
LEDs that have been formed beforehand by flow soldering or the like on a glass epoxy
substrate, whereon an electrically conductive pattern has been formed and covering the LED
with the window 552. An SMD package may comprise an LED chip as defined above, and a
phosphor material that is excited by the light emitted from the LED chip.
[0031] When used with an LED emitting at from 350 to 550 nm and one or more other
appropriate phosphors, the resulting lighting system will produce a light having a white color,
the characteristics of which will be discussed in more detail below.         Lamp 10 may also
include scattering particles (not shown), which are embedded in the encapsulant material.
The scattering particles may comprise, for example, alumina or titania.            The scattering
particles effectively scatter the directional light emitted from the LED chip, preferably with a
negligible amount of absorption.
                                            4
[0032] In addition to the color stable Mn     doped phosphor, phosphor blend 22 may include
one or more other phosphors. When used in a lighting apparatus in combination with a blue
                                                 -8-

or near UV LED emitting radiation in the range of about 250 to 550 nm, the resultant light
emitted by the assembly will be a white light. Other phosphors such as green, blue, orange,
or other color phosphors may be used in the blend to customize the white color of the
resulting light and produce higher CRI sources. When used in conjunction with a LED chip
emitting at from, e.g., 250 to 550 nm, the lighting apparatus preferably includes a blue
phosphor for converting some, and preferably all, of the LED radiation to blue light, which in
turn can then be efficiently converted by the color stable Mn* 4 phosphors and phosphor
blends of the present invention. Suitable phosphors for use in phosphor blends according to
the present invention include, but are not limited to,

[0033] The ratio of each of the individual phosphors in the phosphor blend may vary
depending on the characteristics of the desired light output. The relative proportions of the
individual phosphors in the various embodiment phosphor blends may be adjusted such that
when their emissions are blended and employed in an LED lighting device, there is produced
visible light of predetermined x and y values on the CIE chromaticity diagram. As stated, a
white light is preferably produced. This white light may, for instance, may possess an x
value in the range of about 0.30 to about 0.55, and a y value in the range of about 0.30 to
                                                              -9-

about 0.55. As stated, however, the exact identity and amounts of each phosphor in the
phosphor composition can be varied according to the needs of the end user.
[0034] When combined with a LED emitting at from 350-550 nm and, optionally, one or
more additional phosphors, the use of a phosphor according to the present invention allows
for a white LED device having a higher CRI value and lower CCT as compared to a cerium
doped terbium aluminum garnet (TAG) based lighting device.        LED devices having CCT
values from about 2500 to about 10000, preferably from 2500 to 4500, and high CRI values
from about 70 to 95 can be made.       This allows for an increased ccx coordinate and a
reduced ccy coordinate on the CIE color chromaticity diagram for the LED device, resulting
in a "warmer" color LED.

[0035] The color stable Mn      doped phosphors of the present invention may be used in
applications other than those described above. For example, the material may be used as a
phosphor in a fluorescent lamp, in a cathode ray tube, in a plasma display device or in a
liquid crystal display (LCD).     The material may also be used as a scintillator in an
electromagnetic calorimeter, in a gamma ray camera, in a computed tomography scanner or
in a laser. These uses are merely exemplary and not limiting.
EXAMPLES
General Procedures
Annealing Procedure
[0036] The PFS phosphor was placed in a furnace chamber. The furnace chamber was
evacuated using a mechanical pump and purged multiple times with nitrogen and nitrogen,
fluorine mixtures.  After several pump and purge cycles, the furnace chamber was filled with
an atmosphere containing 20% fluorine gas and 80% nitrogen gas to a pressure of about
1 atmosphere. The chamber was then heated to the desired anneal temperature.           After
holding for about 8 hours, the chamber was cooled to room temperature.         The fluorine
nitrogen mixture was evacuated, the chamber was filled and purged several times with
nitrogen to ensure the complete removal of fluorine gas before opening the chamber.
                                           - 10 -

Preparation of Treatment Solutions
[0037] Aqueous solutions containing HF were prepared using 48% HF (w/w) and solutions
containing H2 SiF 6 were prepared using 35% H2 SiF 6 (w/w). Where K2 SiF 6 was used, it was
added to the solution which was stirred for 30 minutes after the addition, then gravity filtered
through a 2.7 micron pore size filter paper to remove undissolved K2SiF 6 .
Aqueous Solution Treatment
[0038] The phosphor (3 g.) was slowly added to the solution (26 ml), and the mixture was
stirred for 20 minutes.       The phosphor was allowed to settle for 1 minute, then the
supernatant was decanted and the treated phosphor was filtered, rinsed with acetone 3
times, dried under vacuum for 3 hours and sifted.
High Temperature High Humidity (HHTH) Stability Testing
[0039] Samples for high temperature, high humidity (HTHH) treatment were made by mixing
phosphor powders into a two-part methyl silicone binder (RTV-615, Momentive Performance
Materials) in a ratio of 0.9 g phosphor to 0.825 g silicone (parts A+B). The phosphor/silicone
mixture was then poured into aluminum sample holders and cured at 900C for 20 minutes.
Control samples were stored under nitrogen, and samples for exposure to HTHH conditions
were placed into a 850C/85% RH controlled atmosphere chamber.            These HTHH samples
were removed after 300 hours and their luminescence intensity under 450 nm excitation
compared to that of the control samples.
                                              - 11 -

High Light Flux Conditions (Laser Damage) Stability Testing
[0040] A laser diode emitting at 446 nm was coupled to an optical fiber with a collimator at
its other end. The power output was 310 mW and the beam diameter at the sample was 700
microns. This is equivalent to a flux of 80 W/cm 2 on the sample surface. The spectral power
distribution (SPD) spectrum that is a combination of the scattered radiation from the laser
and the emission from the excited phosphor is collected with a 1 meter (diameter) integrating
sphere and the data processed with the spectrometer software (Specwin). At intervals of
two minutes, the integrated power from the laser and the phosphor emission were recorded
(by integrating the SPD from 400nm to 500nm and 550 nm to 700 nm respectively). The first
90 minutes of the measurement are discarded to avoid effects due to the thermal
stabilization of the laser. The percentage of intensity loss due to laser damage is calculated
as follows:
                                       (Power - Initial power)
           Intensity loss (%) = 100          Initial power         = Laser Damage
While only the emitter power from the phosphor is plotted, the integrated power from the
laser emission as well as its peak position was monitored to ensure that the laser remained
stable (variations of less than 1%) during the experiment.
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1-4
[0041] Control materials that were not exposed to the aqueous treatment included the as
synthesized PFS phosphor, that is, material that was not heat treated (Comparative
Example 1) and the PFS phosphor after F2 annealing (Comparative Example 3). The same
materials were also treated with the HF solution containing K2 SiF 6 as described in
US 8,252,613 (Comparative Examples 2 and 4).
EXAMPLES 1-7
[0042] In Examples 1-5, the as-synthesized PFS phosphor (without heat treatment) were
treated with aqueous solutions as shown in Table 1.           In Examples 6 and 7, the PFS
phosphor was        annealed under a fluorine atmosphere          before treatment with    the
hexafluorosilicic acid solutions shown in Table 1.

[0043] The phosphors of Examples 1-7 and Comparative Examples 1-4 were subjected to
HHTH conditions and evaluated for laser damage. Results are shown in Table 2. For these
experiments, plaque measurements of the powder had a standard deviation of 0.6% for
absorbance measurements (Abs.), 1.7% for quantum efficiency measurements (QE) and 2%
for high temperature, high humidity (HTHH) measurements.          The standard deviation for
measuring the quantum efficiency and laser damage of PFS when mixed in a silicone and
measured in an integrating sphere (tape QE) are less than 0.5%.

All aqueous treatments were effective in preventing reduction in intensity after exposure to
HHTH or high light flux condition compared to untreated controls. Comparative Example 1
illustrates the loss of properties of an untreated phosphor stability testing. QE and intensity
after stability testing of the samples of Examples 1-5 was equivalent to or better than that of
Comparative Example 2, which was treated with a solution containing HF and K2SiF 6 , and no
hexafluorosilicic acid.     Likewise, performance of the samples of Examples 6 and 7 were
equivalent to or better than that of Comparative Example 4. However, samples that were
treated with solutions containing no HF produced phosphors had the best balance of
properties after aging. Examples 4, 6 and 7 showed significant reduction in laser damage,
while maintaining HHTH performance and maintaining or improving QE.
[0044] No significant change in particle size was measured for samples produced using any
of the treatment processes.        Although the particle size did not change, the sample of
Example 3 had a tap bulk density that was 1.6x that of Comparative Example 2, indicating
that the H2 SiF 6 treated material is less agglomerated than the HF treated material.      The

[0045] Table 3 shows the results of XPS measurements, which provide elemental analysis
of the surface of the powder and has a detection limit of about 0.1 atomic %. In agreement

[Mn] decreases upon treatment to the detection limits of the measurement system. In
addition, surface carbon and oxygen are also reduced upon treatment.
