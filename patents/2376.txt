TECHNICAL FIELD
     This disclosure relates to, but is not limited to, locating technology, and more
particularly to a three-dimensional space detection system, locating method and system.

     With the development of mobile devices and network technologies, location services are
becoming more and more important in people's lives. Current locating technology can be
divided into outdoor locating and indoor locating according to different locating areas.
Among them, outdoor locating is mainly achieved through the satellite locating system, and
the related outdoor locating technology can well meet the needs of outdoor locating.
     However, outdoor locating technology when used in indoor locating, due to locating
time, locating accuracy and indoor complex environment and other conditions, cannot meet
the needs of users. In order to improve accuracy of indoor locating, indoor locating systems
such as the Vicon/Optitrack optical motion capture system and the 3D laser radar SLAM are
brought about in the related art. The Vicon / Optitrack optical motion capture system needs to

be applied to a field of view overlap of four or more than four infrared cameras. The required
equipment configuration is complicated and the cost is very high, about RMB several
hundred thousand yuan. And, the optical motion capture system can not locate the indoor
geographical coordinates of the terminal. The 3D laser radar SLAM needs the map of the
surrounding environment to be built up and the cost is also very high, about RMB tens of
thousands yuan.

electronics.
      This section provides background information related to the present invention which is
not necessarily prior art.

       The embodiments of the present disclosure are described in detail below with reference
to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood that the embodiments described
below are merely used for describing and explaining the present disclosure, and are not
intended to limit the present disclosure.
       An embodiment of the present disclosure provides a three-dimensional space detection
system, including: a locating base station and a label device to be located, wherein the

detection system provided in this embodiment includes a locating base station 110 and a label
device to be located 120. There may be at least one label devices to be located. That is, one
locating base station can provide locating service to at least one label devices to be located.
       As shown in FIG. 1, the locating base station 110 includes a first synchronization
apparatus 111, two rotating laser plane transmitters 112, 113 (rotating laser plane transmitters
A and B), and an ultrasonic transmitter 114, wherein the first synchronizing apparatus is
configured to synchronize the base time point to the label device to be located; the rotating
laser plane transmitter A is configured to rotationally send a first laser plane signal about a

                                              - 12
first rotation axis; the rotating laser plane transmitter B is configured to rotationally send a
second laser plane signal about a second rotation axis perpendicular to the first rotation axis;
and the ultrasonic transmitter is configured to send the ultrasonic signal.
      Optionally, the first rotation axis and the second rotation axis can intersect. However,
this embodiment is not limited thereto. In practical applications, the first rotation axis may
not intersect with the second rotation axis. For example, a vertical distance between a pair of
parallel planes defined by the first rotation axis and the second rotation axis is within a
corresponding predetermined range.
      Optionally, the ultrasound transmitter is located at the intersection of the first rotation
axis and the second rotation axis. However, this embodiment is not limited thereto. In
practical applications, the ultrasonic transmitter may be located near the intersection of the
first rotation axis and the second rotation axis (for example, within a predetermined sphere

intersection of a straight line perpendicular to the second rotation axis and parallel to the first
rotation axis and the second rotation axis.
      Optionally, the first synchronization apparatus is a radio communication circuit.

synchronization apparatus may also be a light emitting diode (LED), which sends the optical
signal to synchronize the time.

point from the locating base station; the photoelectric sensing circuit is configured to detect
the first laser plane signal and the second laser plane signal sent by the locating base station;
and the ultrasonic receiver is configured to detect the ultrasonic signal sent by the locating

However, this embodiment of the present disclosure is not limited thereto. In other
embodiments, the second synchronization apparatus may also receive the optical signal for
time synchronization. It should be noted that, the first synchronizing apparatus needs to
correspond to the second synchronizing apparatus. For example, when the first synchronizing
apparatus is a radio communication circuit, the second synchronizing apparatus is also a radio
communication circuit. In other words, the first synchronization apparatus and the second
synchronization apparatus adopt a corresponding signal transmission and signal detection
technology to achieve time synchronization between the locating base station and the label
device to be located.
      Optionally, when the 3D space detection system is in operation, the first synchronization
apparatus of the locating base station synchronizes the base time point to the label device to
be located. The laser of the rotating laser plane transmitter of the locating base station is
turned on, and the motor bracket inside the locating base station drives a rotation head of the
laser plane transmitter to rotate, continuously rotationally transmitting a laser plane signal to
the surrounding space. The ultrasonic transmitter of the locating base station continuously
transmits an ultrasonic signal to the surrounding space, e.g. with a pulse frequency of 10 Hz
and a modulation frequency of 40 KHz. In this way, the locating base station can provide the

                                              - 14
label device to be located with locating data with high precision, high frequency and low
delay.
      At the same time, the second synchronizing apparatus of the label device to be located
synchronizes the base time point from the first synchronizing device. When the photoelectric
sensor circuit is swept by the laser plane signal, the photoelectric sensor circuit records the
time point of being swept. When the ultrasonic receiver detects the ultrasonic signal, he
ultrasonic receiver records the time point of detecting the ultrasonic signal.

coordinates to the label device to be located.
      However, the present disclosure is not limited hereto. In other embodiments, the
computing device may also be disposed in other devices independent of the locating base

                                              - 21
station and the label device to be located.
      FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of a three-dimensional locating system according to an
embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in FIG. 3, the computing device 124 is e.g.
disposed in a label device to be located. FIG. 4 is a principle diagram of a three-dimensional
locating method provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure.
      Next, with reference to FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the three-dimensional space locating method
provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure is described in detail by taking the
situation in which the computing device is disposed in the label device to be located as an
example.
      As shown in FIG. 4, description is given by taking the three-dimensional measurement
coordinate system as a Cartesian coordinate system, wherein, the first rotation axis is the X
axis, the second rotation axis is the Y axis, and the position of the ultrasonic transmitter of the
locating base station is the origin 0 of the three-dimensional measurement coordinate system.
However, this embodiment is not limited thereto. In practical applications, the location where
the locating base station is located is, for example, the origin 0 (in this case, the location of
the ultrasound transmitter may be located near the origin 0). The rotating laser plane
transmitter A of the locating base station rotationally sends a first laser plane signal about the
X axis with rotation speed of e.g. wI.The rotating laser plane transmitter B of the locating
base station rotationally sends a second laser plane signal about the Y axis with rotation speed
of e.g. w2. The plane defined by the X and Y axes is the XOY plane. However, this
embodiment is not limited thereto. In practice application, the rotating laser plane transmitter
A of the locating base station rotationally transmits the first laser plane signal, for example,
about a first rotation axis parallel to the X axis, and the rotation laser plane transmitter B of
the locating base station rotationally sends the second laser plane signal about the Y axis (the
second rotation axis), the first rotation axis is perpendicular to, and does not intersect the Y

                                               - 22
axis. In this case, the first rotation axis and the Y axis can define a pair of parallel planes
(including an XOY plane and a plane parallel to the XOY plane). Or, the rotating laser plane
transmitter A of the locating base station rotationally sends the first laser plane signal about
the X axis (first rotation axis), and the rotating laser plane transmitter B of the locating base
station rotationally sends the second laser plane signal about e.g. the second rotation axis
which is parallel to the Y axis, wherein the second rotation axis is perpendicular to, and and
does not intersect the X axis . In this case, the second rotation axis and the X axis can define a
pair of parallel planes (including an XOY plane and a plane parallel to the XOY plane). The
vertical distance between the pair of parallel planes is, for example, within a predetermined
range.
      Herein, the locating base station synchronizes the base time point to the label device to
be located via the first synchronization apparatus (such as a radio communication circuit).
Specifically, by synchronizing the base time point, it is ensured that the locating base station
and the label device to be located keep clock synchronization so as to assure that subsequent
time point information is based on the same base. However, this embodiment is not limited
thereto. The locating base station can also synchronize the base time point to the label device
to be located by generating an optical signal.
      Herein, the locating base station further transmits a base time point at the first laser
plane signal is sent and a base time point at which the second laser plane signal is sent to the
label device to be located via the first synchronization apparatus (such as a radio
communication circuit). Herein, the time point at which the rotating laser plane transmitter A
of the locating base station transmits the first laser plane signal at the first reference angle is
referred to as a first reference time point, and the time point at which the rotating laser plane
transmitter B of the locating base station transmits the second laser plane signal at the second
reference angle is referred to as a second reference time point. The first reference time point

                                                - 23
and the second reference time point are, for example, the same time point or different time.
points, which is not limited in an embodiment of the present disclosure. The first reference
angle and the second reference angle may be the same or different. For example, both the first
reference angle and the second reference angle are 0, that is, the angle of the laser plane
signal sent by the rotating laser plane transmitter A (or B) with respect to the XOY plane at
the first reference time point (or the second reference time point) is 0. However, this
embodiment of the present disclosure is not limited thereto. The first reference angle and the
second reference angle can also other values. When the first reference angle is the same as the
second reference angle and the rotational speeds of the rotary laser plane transmitters A and B
are the same, the first reference time point and the second reference time point are the same
time point. Herein, when there are a plurality of first reference time points and /or second
reference time points, the first one among the plurality of first reference time points in time
sequence and/or the first one among the plurality of second reference time points in time
sequence is, for example, a base time point.
      Specifically, each time the rotating laser plane transmitter A (or B) of the locating base
station transmits a laser plane signal by rotating to a first reference angle (or a second
reference angle), the locating base station transmits, via a first synchronization apparatus
(such as a radio Communication circuit), the first reference time point (or the second
reference time point) to the label device to be located. Herein, with reference to FIG.4, when
the first reference angle is 0 (that is, the included angle between the rotation plane SI and the
XOY plane is 0), the first laser plane signal is taken as an example for description. The first
rotation angle a is the included angle between the rotation plane Sl and the XOY plane.
The computing device can determine the first rotation angle according to the following
formula when the rotating laser plane transmitter A of the locating base station rotationally

                                               - 24
sends the first laser plane signal clockwise about the X axis to send:
          (T -T(N)Wl                360-a
          0(N)      0(N-1)     1l     360
      When the rotating laser plane transmitter A of the locating base station rotationally sends
the first laser plane signal counterclockwise about the X axis, the computing device may
determine the first rotation angle according to the following formula:
          (T -TO(N) w1               a
          0(N)      0(N-1)     1l   360'
where a      is the first rotation angle, Ti is the time point at which the label device to be
located detects the first laser plane signal, To (N) is the first reference time point received by
the label device to be located from the locating base station last time (for example, in case of
a plurality of first reference time points, the N-th first reference time point in time sequence),
To (N-i) is the first reference time point received by the label device to be located from the
locating base station the time previously before last time (for example, in case of a plurality
of first reference time points, the (N-1)-th first reference time point in time sequence), wl is a
the rotation speed of rotational laser plane transmitter A of a locating base station.
      Similarly, the second rotation angle 0 is an included angle between the rotation plane
S2 and the XOY plane, and determined in a manner similar to that for the first rotation angle,
thus not described herein again. It should be noted that, when the rotation speeds wl and w2
are different or the first reference angle and the second reference angle corresponding to the
rotating laser plane transmitters A and B are different from each other, thus rendering the first
reference time point different from the second reference time point, the locating base station
needs to send the first reference time point and the second reference time point to the label

                                               - 25
device to be located respectively.
      In addition, the computing device may determine the distance between the label device
to be located and the locating base station according to the following formula:
       L =(T -T)xv,
where L is the distance between the label device to be located and the locating base station,
T3 is the time point at which the label device to be located detects the ultrasonic signal, To' is
the sending time point at which the locating base station sends the ultrasonic signal, v is the
propagation speed of sound in air, where v is about 340 m/s under 1 standard atmospheric
pressure and temperature of 15 'C.
      It should be noted that, in case where there are a plurality of first reference time points
and second reference time points, the sending time point at which the first one of the plurality
of first reference time points in time sequence is sent, the sending time point at which the first
one of the plurality of second reference time points in time sequence is sent, and the sending
time point at which the ultrasonic signal is sent may be same (e.g. as the base time point) or
different. This embodiment is not limited thereto.
      After obtaining the first rotation angle, the second rotation angle, and the distance
between the label device to be located and the locating base station, the computing device can
obtain the three-dimensional        coordinates of the label device to be located in the
three-dimensional measurement coordinate system according to the following formula:
      X  0
           2 +   2+ Zo 2 - L 2
        Sxtan a= X 0 x tan           = Zo
where (Xo, Yo, Zo) represents the three-dimensional coordinates of the label device to be
located in the three-dimensional measurement coordinate system, L is the distance between
the label device to be located and the locating base station, a is the first rotation angle, and

                                                - 26
 13 is the second rotation angle.
      To sum up, an embodiment of the present disclosure enables accurate indoor locating
based on ultrasonic and laser signals. In an embodiment of the present disclosure,
synchronization and timing information transmission between the locating base station and
the label device to be located are performed by a synchronization apparatus (such as a radio
communication circuit), enabling supporting paired use of the locating base station and the
label device to be located in further support of extension application of multiple base stations.
Moreover, the label device to be located provided in this embodiment has lower cost, is easy
to be miniaturized, and has widened the application scenario.
