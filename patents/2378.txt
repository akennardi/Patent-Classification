                   TAZOBACTAM ARGININE ANTIBIOTIC COMPOSITIONS
                                        RELATED APPLICATION
             This application is a divisional of Australian Patent Application No. 2013323280, the
  5 entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
                                            TECHNICAL FIELD
             This disclosure relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising tazobactam
    arginine and related methods and uses thereof.
 .0                                           BACKGROUND
             The cephalosporin (6R,7R)-3 -[(5 -amino-4-{[(2-aminoethyl)carbamoyl] amino } -1
    methyl-i H-pyrazol-2-ium-2-yl)methyl] -7-({(2Z)-2-(5 -amino-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3 -yl)-2- [(1
    carboxy-1-methylethoxy)imino]acetyl}amino)-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2
    carboxylate (also referred to as ceftolozane, or (6R,7R)-3-[5-Amino-4-[3-(2
 .5 aminoethyl)ureido]   -1-methyl-i   H-pyrazol-2-ium-2-ylmethyl] -7-[2-(5 -amino-1,2,4-thiadiazol
    3-yl)-2-[(Z)-1-carboxy-1-methylethoxyimino]acetamido]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic            acid) is an
    antibacterial agent. The antibacterial activity of ceftolozane is believed to result from its
    interaction with penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) to inhibit the biosynthesis of the bacterial
    cell wall which acts to stop bacterial replication. Ceftolozane can be combined (e.g., mixed)
 .0 with a  p-lactamase  inhibitor ("BLI"), such as tazobactam. Tazobactam is a BLI against Class
    A and some Class C p-lactamases, with well-established in vitro and in vivo efficacy in
    combination with active     p-lactam antibiotics.
             Antibiotic pharmaceutical compositions can include a beta-lactam compound having
    antibiotic properties (i.e., an antibiotic compound possessing one or more beta-lactam
25  moieties) and a BLI, such as tazobactam. Beta-lactam compounds can be formulated with
    and/or administered in combination with, beta-lactamase inhibiting compounds (e.g.,
    tazobactam and salts thereof) in order to mitigate the effects of bacterial beta-lactamases. For
    example, the combination of ceftolozane and tazobactam in a 2:1 weight ratio is an antibiotic
    pharmaceutical composition ("CXA-201") formulated for parenteral administration. CXA
30  201 displays potent antibacterial activity in vitro against common Gram-negative and
    selected Gram-positive organisms. CXA-201 is a broad-spectrum antibacterial with in vitro
    activity against Enterobacteriaceae including strains expressing extended spectrum      P
                                                      1

    lactamases-resistant (MIC9 o = 1 tg/mL), as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)
    including multi-drug resistant strains (MIC9 o= 2 pg/mL). CXA-201 is a combination
    antibacterial with activity against many Gram-negative pathogens known to cause
    intrapulmonary infections, including nosocomial pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa.

                                                SUMMARY
             Provided herein are compositions comprising beta-lactam compounds (e.g.,
    ceftolozane, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) and tazobactam arginine, including
    pharmaceutical compositions comprising beta-lactam compounds and crystalline tazobactam
 .0 arginine, and pharmaceutical compositions prepared using beta-lactam compounds and
    crystalline tazobactam arginine. Methods of making and related uses of these combinations
    are also provided.
             Particularly, pharmaceutical compositions can comprise a beta-lactam compound and
    crystalline tazobactam arginine. Crystalline compounds of tazobactam arginine can also
 .5 possess properties that are beneficial to the preparation of various drug formulations and
    pharmaceutical compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising crystalline forms of
    tazobactam arginine, or pharmaceutical compositions prepared using crystalline forms of
    tazobactam arginine, may exhibit beneficial properties including desired levels of chemical
    stability over time and/or in the presence of heat and humidity, and reduced levels of
 .0 impurities. Compared with previous crystalline forms of tazobactam, certain crystalline
    tazobactam arginine solid forms are provided herein that have the advantageous characteristic
    of being less hygroscopic. These crystalline tazobactam arginine solid forms can have good
    thermal stability and light stability in the process of preparation, packing, transportation and
    storage.
25           Preferably, the beta-lactam compound used in combination with crystalline
    tazobactam arginine is (6R,7R)-3 - [(5-amino-4-{[(2-aminoethyl)carbamoyl] amino } -1-methyl
    1H-pyrazol-2-ium-2-yl)methyl] -7-({(2Z)-2-(5-amino- 1,2,4-thiadiazol-3 -yl)-2-[(1 -carboxy- 1
    methylethoxy)imino] acetyl} amino)-8-oxo-5-thia- 1-azabicyclo [4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate,
    or a pharmaceutically acceptable isomer, salt, ester, hydrate, solvate, or combination thereof.
30           In another aspect, provided herein is a method of making a pharmaceutical
    composition comprising combining crystalline tazobactam arginine and a beta-lactam
    compound. In one embodiment, the method comprises the steps of: (1) preparing a mixture
                                                      2

    comprising crystalline tazobactam arginine and a beta-lactam compound; (2) preparing an
    aqueous solution from the mixture; and (3) lyophilizing the solution to obtain said
    pharmaceutical composition.
             Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions prepared according to the above
  5 method.
             The above pharmaceutical compositions can be used in methods for the treatment of
    bacterial infections in a mammal, the methods comprising administering to said mammal a
    therapeutically effective amount of the pharmaceutical compositions.

                                      DETAILED DESCRIPTION
             Pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more drug substances or excipients
    can be prepared in a variety of ways, including, for example, blending and lyophilization
  0 (also known as "co-lyophilization"). As is known to those skilled in the art, lyophilization is
    a process of freeze-drying in which water is sublimed from a frozen solution of one or more
    solutes. Specific methods of lyophilization are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical
    Sciences, Chapter 84, page 1565, Eighteenth Edition, A. R. Gennaro, (Mack Publishing Co.,
    Easton, Pa., 1990).
25           The formulation of pharmaceutical compositions can be selected to minimize
    decomposition of the constituent drug substances and to produce a composition that is stable
    under a variety of storage conditions. Surprisingly, pharmaceutical compositions comprising
    crystalline forms of tazobactam arginine (e.g., pharmaceutical compositions prepared using
    crystalline forms of tazobactam arginine) have been observed to exhibit beneficial properties
30  including desired levels of chemical stability over the course of time and/or in the presence of
    heat and humidity, and reduced levels of impurities. In a particular embodiment described
    herein (see Example 4), a pharmaceutical composition prepared from crystalline tazobactam
                                                    3

    arginine and ceftolozane was observed to undergo less decomposition of both tazobactam and
    ceftolozane over time.
            The beneficial properties of the above pharmaceutical compositions may be
    attributable to the unique physical properties of crystalline tazobactam arginine. Tazobactam
  5 arginine can occur in an amorphous solid form or in a crystalline solid form. Crystalline
    solid forms of tazobactam arginine can exist in one or more unique polymorph forms, which
    can additionally comprise one or more equivalents of water or solvent (i.e., hydrates or
    solvates, respectively).
            Tazobactam arginine is the salt of the conjugate base of tazobactam and the conjugate
 .0 acid of (S)-2-amino-5-guanidinopentanoic acid (L-arginine) in a 1:1 ratio, as represented by
    the structure below.

                                              Tazobactam arginine
            Accordingly, provided herein are compositions comprising a beta-lactam compound
 .5 and crystalline tazobactam arginine, or hydrates and solvates thereof, particularly crystalline
    tazobactam arginine polymorph Ia, (also referred to herein as "polymorph Ia" or "tazobactam
    arginine polymorph Ia") and crystalline tazobactam arginine polymorph Tb (also referred to
    herein as "polymorph Ib" or "tazobactam arginine polymorph Tb").
    Polymorphism
20          The ability of a substance to exist in more than one crystal form is defined as
    polymorphism; the different crystal forms of a particular substance are referred to as
    "polymorphs." In general, polymorphism is affected by the ability of a molecule of a
    substance to change its conformation or to form different intermolecular or intra-molecular
    interactions, particularly hydrogen bonds, which is reflected in different atom arrangements
25  in the crystal lattices of different polymorphs. In contrast, the overall external form of a
    substance is known as "morphology," which refers to the external shape of the crystal and the
    planes present, without reference to the internal structure. Crystals can display different
                                                       4

    morphology based on different conditions, such as, for example, growth rate, stirring, and the
    presence of impurities.
             The different polymorphs of a substance can possess different energies of the crystal
    lattice and, thus, in solid state they can show different physical properties such as form,
  5 density, melting point, color, stability, solubility, dissolution rate, etc., which can, in turn,
    affect the stability, dissolution rate and/or bioavailability of a given polymorph and its
    suitability for use as a pharmaceutical and in pharmaceutical compositions.
             Access to different polymorphs of tazobactam arginine is desirable for other reasons
    as well. One such reason is that different polymorphs of a compound (e.g., tazobactam
 .0 arginine) can incorporate different impurities, or chemical residues, upon crystallization.
    Certain polymorphs incorporate very little, or no, chemical residues. Accordingly, the
    formation of certain polymorph forms of a compound may result in purification of the
    compound.
             Tazobactam arginine polymorph Ia exhibits low hygroscopicity relative to amorphous
 .5 tazobactam arginine and amorphous tazobactam sodium. Low hygroscopicity of a solid
    compound is desirable for several reasons. For example, compounds that are highly
    hygroscopic may be chemically unstable, or unsuitable for formulating as a drug product due
    to changes of the drug form's physical characteristics (e.g., bulk density, dissolution rate, etc.)
    that can occur if it is stored in settings with varying relative humidity. Also, hygroscopicity
 .0 can impact large-scale manufacturing and handling of a compound. For example, it may be
    difficult to determine the true weight of a hygroscopic active agent when preparing a
    pharmaceutical composition comprising that agent.
    Characterization of solid crystalline forms of tazobactam arginine
             In certain embodiments, the compounds used in the combination therapies described
25  herein are identifiable on the basis of characteristic peaks in an X-ray powder diffraction
    analysis. X-ray powder diffraction, also referred to as XRPD, is a scientific technique using
    X-ray, neutron, or electron diffraction on powder, microcrystalline, or other solid materials
    for structural characterization of the materials.
             As used herein, the phrase "degrees 2-Theta ± 0.3"' indicates that each subsequently
30  listed angle has an error of± 0.30; the phrase "degrees 2-Theta ± 0.2"' indicates that each
    subsequently listed angle has an error of± 0.20; and the phrase "degrees 2-Theta ± 0.         "
    indicates that each subsequently listed angle has an error of± 0.10. For example, the phrase
                                                       5

    "degrees 2-Theta ± 0.20 at angles of 1, 2 and 3" is equivalent to the phrase "degrees 2-Theta
    at angles of 1 ± 0.20, 2 ± 0.20 and 3 ± 0.2".

    Pharmaceutical Compositions
            The term "pharmaceutical composition" includes preparations suitable for
20  administration to mammals, e.g., humans. When the compounds of the present invention are
    administered as pharmaceuticals to mammals, e.g., humans, they can be given per se or as a
    pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1% to 99.9% (more preferably, 0.5 to
    90%) of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
            The pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be formulated to have any
25  concentration desired (i.e., any concentration of crystalline tazobactam arginine, or a hydrate
    or solvate thereof, and any concentration of a beta-lactam compound). In some
                                                      11

    embodiments, the composition is formulated such that it comprises at least a therapeutically
    effective amount of both compounds (i.e., a therapeutically effective amount of the
    combination of crystalline tazobactam arginine, or a hydrate or solvate thereof, and the beta
    lactam compound). In some embodiments, the composition is formulated such that it would
  5 not cause one or more unwanted side effects.
            Pharmaceutical compositions include those suitable for oral, sublingual, nasal rectal,
    vaginal, topical, buccal and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and
    intravenous) administration, although the most suitable route will depend on the nature and
    severity of the condition being treated. The compositions may be conveniently presented in
 .0 unit dosage form, and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. In
    certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is formulated for oral administration in
    the form of a pill, capsule, lozenge or tablet. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical
    composition is in the form of a suspension.

             As used herein, "treating", "treat" or "treatment" describes the management and care
    of a patient for the purpose of combating a disease, condition, or disorder and includes the
  5 administration of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention to alleviate the
    symptoms or complications of a disease, condition or disorder, or to eliminate the disease,
    condition or disorder. The term "treat" can also include treatment of a cell in vitro or an
    animal model.
             By a "therapeutically effective amount" of a compound of the invention is meant a
 .0 sufficient amount of the compound to treat the disorder (e.g., bacterial infection). The
    specific therapeutically effective amount that is required for the treatment of any particular
    patient or organism (e.g., a mammal) will depend upon a variety of factors including the
    disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound
    or composition employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general
 .5 health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate
    of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in
    combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well
    known in the medical arts (see, for example, Goodman and Gilman's, "The Pharmacological
    Basis of Therapeutics", Tenth Edition, A. Gilman, J.Hardman and L. Limbird, eds., McGraw
 '0 Hill Press, 155-173, 2001, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The
    therapeutically effective amount for a given situation can be readily determined by routine
    experimentation and is within the skill and judgment of the ordinary clinician.

    Instrumentation and Methods
    I.       X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) experiments were performed using a Bruker D8
    Advance X-ray powder diffractometer utilizing a zero return silicon plate, a step size of 0.01',
    a step time of 0.3 sec/step, Cu/Ka radiation, tube power of 40kV/4OmA, a nickel filter, and a
  5 LynxEye high speed detector. A suitable amount of sample was placed directly on the
    sample holder, pressed flat to smooth, and analyzed from 3-40' 20 using Bragg-Brentano
    optics. Analysis was started immediately following sample preparation.
     II.     Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed on a TA
    Instruments Q100 instrument. A temperature range of 40 'C to 300 'C with a ramp rate of 10
 .0 'C/minute was utilized. Approximately 1.0 mg of sample was weighed into a tared aluminum
    sample pan and sealed hermetically. A small hole was pushed into the cover of the sample
    pan to allow for pressure release.
     III.    Thermo Gravemetric Analysis (TGA) experiments were performed on a TA
    Instruments 5000 instrument from 20 to 300 'C with a heating rate of 10 'C/minute for all
 .5 samples.

    Example 1: Preparationof Tazobactam Arginine Crystalline Polymorph Ia
             Tazobactam arginine amorphous (1.00 g) was dissolved in 10.0 mL of deionized
 .0 water. 30 mL of acetone was added to the aqueous solution by drop-wise addition. The
    mixture was allowed to sit overnight at ambient temperature, resulting in white fine needles.
    After filtration and vacuum drying for 4 hours, tazobactam arginine polymorph Ia (516 mg)
    was obtained. The XRPD spectrum of the tazobactam arginine polymorph Ia is depicted in
    Figure 1.
25  Example 2: Preparationofpharmaceuticalcomposition using tazobactam arginine
    polymorph Ia and ceftolozane.
             A mixture is prepared comprising: tazobactam arginine polymorph Ia and ceftolozane
    in a molar ratio in the range of 1:2 to 2:1; L-arginine, such that the molar ratio of L-arginine
    to ceftolozane is in the range of 4:1 to 1:4; citric acid, such that the pH of an aqueous solution
30  of the mixture is in the range of 5-7; and sodium chloride, such that the concentration of
    sodium chloride in an aqueous solution of the mixture is in the range of 0.1M - 1 M. The
    mixture is dissolved in deionized water, such that the molar ratio of ceftolozane in the
                                                      28

    aqueous solution is in the range of 0.01M - 1OM. The resulting aqueous solution is then
    lyophilized to afford the title pharmaceutical composition.
    Example 3: Stability of Formulationsof ceftolozane and solidforms of tazobactam
             Formulations A-D of Table 3 were prepared as follows:

    arginine, 0.022 g (0.115 mmol) of citric acid, 0.49 g (8.39 mmol) of NaCl was dissolved in
    30 mL of water (final pH 5.81), then filtered through a 0.2 pm membrane, and lyophilized 24
    hr to obtain an off-white powder, 2.2 g. A 480 mg portion was used for stability testing at 25
    0
      C (60% RH).

    arginine, 0.022 g (0.115 mmol) of citric acid, 0.50 g (1.67 mmol) of tazobactam acid, and
    0.49 g (8.39 mmol) of NaCl was dissolved in 30 mL of water (final pH 6.72), then filtered
    through a 0.2 pm membrane, and lyophilized 24 hr to obtain an off-white powder, 3.22 g. A
    490 mg portion was used for stability testing at 25 0C (60% RH).
 .5 Formulation C: 1.237 g (1.5 mmol) of 90% ceftolozane sulfate, 0.62 g (3.56 mmol) of L
    arginine, 0.022 g (0.115 mmol) of citric acid, and 0.49 g (8.39 mmol) of NaCl was dissolved
    in 30 mL of water (resulting pH 6.34), then added 0.79 g (1.67 mmol) of tazobactam arginine
    polymorph Ta and stirred to dissolve (final pH 6.30), filtered through a 0.2 pm membrane,
    and lyophilized 24 hr to obtain an off-white powder, 3.10 g. A 510 mg portion was used for
 .0 stability testing at 25 "C (60% RH).
    Formulation D: 1.0 g of Formulation A (0.7 mmol ceftolozane sulfate; 1.67 mmol L
    arginine), and 0.21 g (0.65 mmol) tazobactam sodium was dissolved in 20 mL of water (final
    pH 5.89), then filtered through a 0.2 pm membrane, and lyophilized 24 hr to obtain an off
    white-powder, 1.074 g. A 195 mg portion was tested for stability at 25 C (60% RH).
25           The above formulations were analyzed by HPLC at the following time points: TO:
    (Immediately after lyophilization); TI (After one month at 25 'C and 60% relative humidity);
    and T2 (After three months at 25 'C and 60% relative humidity).
             Of the three tazobactam-containing formulations (B, C and D), formulation D
    (containing tazobactam sodium) exhibited the highest degree of ceftolozane decomposition at
30  T2. Formulation B (containing tazobactam acid and L-arginine) exhibited less ceftolozane
    decomposition than formulation D, and formulation C (containing tazobactam arginine
    polymorph Ia) exhibited significantly less ceftolozane decomposition than formulation B.
    Formulation C also exhibited significantly lower amounts of by-products having retention
