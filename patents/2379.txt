                             ABSTRACT
             A method of forming an Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy coating
   on a steel strip includes dipping steel strip into a bath
 5 of molten Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy and forming a coating of the
   alloy on exposed surfaces of the steel strip.          The method
   also includes controlling conditions in the molten coating
   bath and downstream of the coating bath so that there is a
   uniform Al/Zn ratio across the surface of the coating
10 formed on the steel strip. An Al-Zn-Mg-Si coated steel
   strip includes a uniform Al/Zn ratio on the surface or the
   outermost 1-2pm of the Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy coating.

                     METAL-COATED STEEL STRIP
   FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 5           The present invention relates to the production
   of metal strip, typically steel strip, which has a
   corrosion-resistant metal alloy coating that contains
   aluminium, zinc, silicon, and magnesium as the main
   elements in the alloy, and is hereinafter referred to as
10 an "Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy" on this basis.
             In particular, the present invention relates to a
   hot-dip metal coating method of forming an Al-Zn-Si-Mg
   alloy coating on a strip that includes dipping uncoated
15 strip into a bath of molten Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy and forming
   a coating of the alloy on the strip.
             Typically, the Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy of the present
   invention comprises the following ranges in % by weight of
20 the elements Al, Zn, Si, and Mg:
             Zn:        30 to 60%
             Si:        0.3 to 3%
             Mg:        0.3 to 10%
             Balance:   Al and unavoidable impurities.
25
             More typically, the Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy of the
   present invention comprises the following ranges in % by
   weight of the elements Al, Zn, Si, and Mg:
             Zn:        35 to 50%
30           Si:        1.2 to 2.5%
             Mg:        1.0 to 3.0%
             Balance:   Al and unavoidable impurities.
             The Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy coating may contain other
35 elements that are present as deliberate alloying additions
   or as unavoidable impurities.    Hence, the phrase "Al-Zn
   Si-Mg alloy" is understood herein to cover alloys that
                                              10291073_1 (GHMatters) P92447.AU.2 21/05/18

                               - 2
   contain such other elements as deliberate alloying
   additions or as unavoidable impurities.  The other
   elements may include by way of example any one or more of
   Ca, Ti, Fe, Sr, Cr, and V.

             Depending on the end-use application, the metal
   coated strip may be painted, for example with a polymeric
   paint, on one or both surfaces of the strip.         In this
   regard, the metal-coated strip may be sold as an end
10 product itself or may have a paint coating applied to one
   or both surfaces and be sold as a painted end product.
             The present invention relates particularly but
   not exclusively to steel strip that is coated with the
15 above-described Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy and is optionally coated
   with a paint and thereafter is cold formed (e.g. by roll
   forming) into an end-use product, such as building
   products (e.g. profiled wall and roofing sheets).
20 BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
             One corrosion resistant metal coating composition
   that is used widely in Australia and elsewhere for
   building products, particularly profiled wall and roofing
25 sheets, is a 55% by weight Al-Zn coating composition that
   also comprises Si.  It is noted that, unless otherwise
   stated, all references to percentages are references to
   percentages by weight.
30           The profiled sheets are usually manufactured by
   cold forming painted, metal alloy coated strip.
   Typically, the profiled sheets are manufactured by roll
   forming the painted strip.
35           The microstructure of coatings of the coating
   composition on profiled sheets typically comprises Al-rich
   dendrites and Zn-rich interdendritic channels.
                                            10291073_1 (GHMatters) P92447.AU.2 21/05/18

                               - 3
             The addition of Mg to this known composition of
   55%Al-Zn-Si coating composition has been proposed in the
   patent literature for a number of years, see for example
 5 US patent 6,635,359 in the name of Nippon Steel
   Corporation, but Al-Zn-Si-Mg coatings on steel strip are
   not commercially available in Australia.
             It has been established that when Mg is included
10 in a 55%Al-Zn-Si coating composition, Mg brings about
   certain beneficial effects on product performance, such as
   improved cut-edge protection.
             The applicant has carried out extensive research
15 and development work in relation to Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy
   coatings on strip such as steel strip which has included
   plant trials.  The present invention is the result of part
   of this research and development work.
20           During the course of plant trials, the applicant
   noticed a defect on the surface of Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy
   coated steel strip.  The plant trials were carried out
   with an Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy having the following
   composition, in wt. %: 53Al-43Zn-2Mg-1.5Si-0.45Fe and
25 incidental impurities.   The applicant was surprised that
   the defect occurred.   The applicant had not observed the
   defect in extensive laboratory work on Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy
   coatings.  Moreover, since noticing the defect in plant
   trials, the applicant has not been able to reproduce the
30 defect in the laboratory.   The applicant has not observed
   the defect on standard 55%Al-Zn alloy coated steel strip
   that has been available commercially in Australia and
   elsewhere for many years.
35           The applicant has found that the defect has a
   number of different forms, including streaks, patches, and
                                             10291073_1 (GHMatters) P92447.AU.2 21/05/18

                                - 4
   a wood grain pattern.   The defect is described internally
   by the applicant as an "ash" mark.
              A severe example of the defect is shown in Figure
 5 1, which is a photograph of a part of the surface of an
   Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy coated steel strip from the plant trials
   captured under outdoor viewing conditions - low angle in
   direct sunlight.   In Figure 1 the defect manifests itself
   as darker areas taking a number of shapes. In this example
10 the ash mark defect appears as   (a) a patch (a well-defined
   area that is uniformly darker than the surrounding area),
    (b) a streak (a narrow area extending along the length of
   the strip which is darker than the surrounding area) and
    (c) a wood grain pattern  (an area extending along the
15 length of the strip, with clear darker lines and lighter
   lines between the darker lines. i.e. similar to a wood
   grain),  on the coated steel strip surface when viewed at
   low viewing angles under "optimum" lighting.           The
   applicant has found that as the viewing angle increases
20 towards the perpendicular, the visual distinction of the
   defect rapidly decreases until it can no longer be seen,
   with no obvious coating artefacts present at the surface,
   e.g. metal spots, dross or spangle variation.
25            The applicant has found that the defect is not
   confined to the morphologies shown in Figure 1 and can be
   other configurations of darker areas.
              The defect is a concern to the applicant from the
30 viewpoint of the aesthetic appearance of coated strip.
   This is a very important issue commercially.
              The above discussion is not to be taken as an
   admission of the common general knowledge in Australia and
35 elsewhere.

                              - 5
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
             The applicant has found that the above-described
   ash mark defect is due to variations in the Al/Zn ratio on
 5 the surface of Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy coatings, specifically, a
   decrease in the surface Al/Zn ratio within the defect
   area, owing to an increased average width of Zn-rich
   interdendritic channels on the surface of the coatings.
10           The applicant has observed that the variations in
   Al/Zn ratio that are relevant to the defect are in, but
   not necessarily limited to the outermost 1-2pm of the
   coating cross section.
15           The applicant has also found that the defect is
   most easily detected by elemental mapping of the defect
   boundary with an electron probe microanalyser
             According to the present invention there is
20 provided a method of forming a coating of an Al-Zn-Si-Mg
   based alloy on a substrate, such as although not limited
   to a steel strip, that is characterised by controlling
   conditions in (a) a bath containing the Al-Zn-Si-Mg-based
   alloy for coating the substrate and (b) downstream of the
25 molten coating bath so that there is a uniform Al/Zn ratio
   across the surface of the coating formed on the substrate.
             The term "uniform" in the context of the Al/Zn
   ratio is understood herein to mean a variation of
30 typically less than 0.1 in the Al/Zn ratio between any two
   or more independent 1 mm x 1 mm areas as measured by
   Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS).
   Notwithstanding the aforementioned Al/Zn ratio variation
   limit, the suitability of the coating for commercial use
35 and hence the meaning of the word "uniform" is defined by
   the visual surface appearance under optimum lighting
   conditions.
                                            10291073_1 (GHMatters) P92447.AU.2 21/05/18

                              - 6
             According to the present invention there is
   provided a method of forming an Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy coating
   on a steel strip to form the above-described Al-Zn-Mg-Si
 5 coated steel strip, the method including dipping steel
   strip into a bath of molten Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy and forming
   a coating of the alloy on exposed surfaces of the steel
   strip, and the method including controlling conditions in
   the molten coating bath and downstream of the coating bath
10 so that there is a uniform Al/Zn ratio across the surface
   of the coating formed on the steel strip.
             Whilst not wishing to be bound to the following
   comment, the applicant believes that the defect may be due
15 to a non-uniform surface/sub-surface distribution of Mg2Si
   in the microstructure of the coatings. The applicant has
   observed an increased nucleation rate of Mg2Si in              the lower
   half of the coating cross section within the defect
   region.
20
             The method may include controlling any suitable
   conditions in the molten coating bath and downstream of
   the coating bath.
25           By way of example, the method may include
   controlling any one or more of the composition of the
   molten coating bath, and the rate of cooling the coated
   steel strip after the coated steel strip leaves the molten
   coating bath.
30
             Typically, the method includes controlling the Ca
   concentration of the molten coating bath.
             Typically, the Ca concentration of the molten
35 coating bath is determined by a generally standard
   practice in the industry of taking coating bath samples
   and analysing the samples by any one of a number of known
                                             10291073_1 (GHMatters) P92447.AU.2 21/05/18

   analysis options such as XRF and ICP, with measurement
   tolerances typically of plus/minus 10 ppm.
             The method may include controlling the Ca
 5 concentration to be at least 100 ppm.
             The method may include controlling the Ca
   concentration to be at least 120 ppm.
10           The method may include controlling the Ca
   concentration to be less than 200 ppm.
             The method may include controlling the Ca
   concentration to be less than 180 ppm.
15
             The Ca concentration may be any other suitable
   concentration range.
             Typically, the method includes controlling the Mg
20 concentration of the molten coating bath.
             Typically, the Mg concentration of the molten
   coating bath is determined by a generally standard
   practice in the industry of taking coating bath samples
25 and analysing the samples by any one of a number of known
   analysis options such as XRF and ICP, with measurement
   tolerances typically of plus/minus 10 ppm.
             The method may include controlling the Mg
30 concentration to be at least 0.3%.
             The method may include controlling the Mg
   concentration to be at least 1.8%.
35           The method may include controlling the Mg
   concentration to be at least 1.9%.
                                             10291073_1 (GHMatters) P92447.AU.2 21/05/18

                                  - 8
                The method may include controlling the Mg
   concentration to be at least 2%.
                The method may include controlling the Mg
 5 concentration to be at least 2.1%.
                The Mg concentration may be any other suitable
   concentration range.
10              The method may include controlling the post
   coating bath cooling rate to be less than 40'C/s while the
   coated strip temperature is in the temperature range 400 0 C
   to 510 0 C.
15              The applicant has found that, for the coating
   alloy compositions tested, the coating temperature range
   of 400 0 C to 510 0 C is significant and that cooling quickly
   in this range is undesirable due to accentuating
   variations in the Al/Zn ratio to the extent that the
20 differences become visually apparent as the ash mark
   defect.     The selection of the cooling rate to be less than
   40'C/s within this temperature range is based on
   minimising accentuating variations in the Al/Zn ratio.
25              The applicant has also found that coating
   temperatures below 400 0 C have no significant impact on the
   Al/Zn ratio at the surface of a coating.
                The applicant has also found that temperatures
30 above 510 0 C have no significant impact on the uniformity
   of Al/Zn ratio.
                It is emphasised that, in any given situation,
   the limits of the significant temperature range will be
35 dependent on the coating alloy composition and the
   invention is not necessarily confined to the coating
   temperature range of 400 0 C to 510 0 C.
                                                10291073_1 (GHMatters) P92447.AU.2 21/05/18

                                - 9
               The method may include controlling the post
   coating bath cooling rate to be less than 350 C/s while the
   coated strip temperature is in the temperature range 400 0 C
 5 to 510 0 C.
               The method may include controlling the post
   coating bath cooling rate to be greater than 10 0 C/s in the
   temperature range 400 0 C to 510 0 C.
10
               The method may include controlling the post
   coating bath cooling rate to be greater than 15 0 C/s in the
   temperature range 400 0 C to 510 0 C.
15             Typically, the cooling rate of coated strip is
   controlled via a computerised model.
               The applicant believes that the selection of any
   one or more than one of Ca concentration, Mg concentration
20 and post-coating bath cooling rate is independent of
   coating mass.
               In general terms, the invention appears to be
   independent of coating mass.
25
               Typically, the coating mass is 50-200 g/m 2 .
               The Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy may comprise more than 1.8%
   by weight Mg.

   1.9% Mg.

35 2% Mg.

 5 3% Mg.
             The Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy may include less than
   2.5% Mg.
10           The Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy may include more than
   1.2% Si.
             The Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy may include less than
   2.5% Si.
15
             The Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy may include the following
   ranges in % by weight of the elements Al, Zn, Si, and Mg:
             Zn:       30 to 60%
             Si:       0.3 to 3%

   DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS
             The present invention is described further by
   way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings
20 of which:
             Figure 1 is the above-described photograph of
   part of the surface of the Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy coated steel
   strip from the plant trials captured under ideal viewing
25 conditions; and
             Figure 2 is a schematic drawing of one embodiment
   of a continuous production line for producing steel strip
   coated with an Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy in accordance with the
30 method of the present invention.
   DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION
             With reference to Figure 2, in use, coils of
35 cold-rolled low carbon steel strip are uncoiled at an
   uncoiling station 1 and successive uncoiled lengths of
   strip are welded end to end by a welder 2 and form a
                                            10291073_1 (GHMatters) P92447.AU.2 21/05/18

                                - 12
   continuous length of strip.
              The strip is then passed successively through an
   accumulator 3, a strip cleaning section 4 and a furnace
 5 assembly 5.    The furnace assembly 5 includes a preheater,
   a pre-heat reducing furnace, and a reducing furnace.
              The strip is heat treated in the furnace assembly
   5 by careful control of process variables including:(i)
10 the temperature profile in the furnaces,     (ii) the reducing
   gas concentration in the furnaces,    (iii) the gas flow rate
   through the furnaces, and (iv) strip residence time in the
   furnaces  (i.e. line speed).
15            The process variables in the furnace assembly 5
   are controlled so that there is removal of iron oxide
   residues from the surface of the strip and removal of
   residual oils and iron fines from the surface of the
   strip.
20
              The heat treated strip is then passed via an
   outlet snout downwardly into and through a molten bath
   containing an Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy having a Ca concentration
   in a range of 100-200 ppm in a coating pot 6 and is coated
25 with Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy.    The Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy is
   maintained molten in the coating pot at a selected
   temperature in a range of 595-610'C by use of heating
   inductors   (not shown).  Within the bath the strip passes
   around a sink roll and is taken upwardly out of the bath.
30 The line speed is selected to provide a selected immersion
   time of strip in the coating bath to produce a coating
   having a coating mass of 50-200 g/m 2 on both surfaces of
   the strip.
35           After leaving the coating bath 6 the strip passes
   vertically through a gas wiping station (not shown) at
   which its coated surfaces are subjected to jets of wiping
                                               10291073_1 (GHMatters) P92447.AU.2 21/05/18

                                - 13
   gas to control the thickness of the coating.
               The coated strip is then passed through a cooling
   section 7 and subjected to forced cooling at a selected
 5 cooling rate greater than 10'C/s but less than 400 C/s
   while the coated strip temperature is between 400'C and
   510 0 C. The cooling rate may be any suitable cooling rate
   at coated strip temperatures less than 400'C or greater
   than 510 0 C.
10
               The cooled, coated strip is then passed through a
   rolling section 8 that conditions the surface of the
   coated strip.
15             The coated strip is thereafter coiled at a
   coiling station 10.
               As discussed above, the applicant has conducted
   extensive research and development work in relation to Al
20 Zn-Si-Mg alloy coatings on steel strip which includes
   plant trials and the applicant noticed a defect on the
   surface of Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy coated steel strip during
   plant trials.    The plant trials were carried out with an
   Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy having the following composition, in wt.
25 %: 53Al-43Zn-2Mg-1.5Si-0.45Fe and incidental impurities.
   The applicant was surprised that the defect occurred.                        The
   applicant had not observed the defect in extensive
   laboratory work on Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy coatings.            Moreover,
   since noticing the defect in plant trials, the applicant
30 has not been able to reproduce the defect in the
   laboratory.    The applicant has not observed the defect on
   standard 55%Al-Zn alloy coated steel strip that has been
   available commercially in Australia and elsewhere for many
   years.   Moreover, as discussed above, the applicant has
35 found that the defect has a number of different forms,
   including streaks, patches, and a wood grain pattern, and
                                              10291073_1 (GHMatters) P92447.AU.2 21/05/18

                                - 14
   severe examples of each of these forms of the defect are
   shown in Figure 1.
             As is discussed above, the applicant has found
 5 that the above-described defect is due to variations in
   the Al/Zn ratio on the surface of Al-Zn-Si-Mg alloy
   coatings and may be due to a non-uniform distribution of
   Mg2Si in the microstructure of the of coatings and the
   invention includes controlling conditions in the molten
10 coating bath and downstream of the coating bath so that
   there is a uniform Al/Zn ratio across the surface of the
   coating formed on the steel strip.
             The method of the invention includes controlling
15 any suitable conditions in the molten coating bath and
   downstream of the coating bath so that there is a uniform
   Al/Zn ratio  (in accordance with the definition on page 5)
   across the surface of the coating, i.e. on or within the
   outermost 1-2pm of the coating cross section, formed on
20 the steel strip.
             By way of example, the embodiment of the method
   of the invention described in relation to Figure 2
   includes controlling (a) the Ca concentration in the
25 molten coating bath,   (b) the Mg concentration of the
   molten coating bath, and (c) the rate of cooling the
   coated steel strip after the coated steel strip leaves the
   molten coating bath, as described above in the description
   of Figure 2.
30
             It is noted that the invention is not confined to
   controlling this combination of conditions.
             Many modifications may be made to the present
35 invention described above without departing from the
   spirit and scope of the invention.
