POSITIVELY CHARGED WATER-SOLUBLE PRO-DRUGS OF IBUPROFEN
ABSTRACT
The novel positively charged pro-drugs of ibuprofen in the general formula (I) "Structure 1"
were designed and synthesized. The compounds of the general formula (I) "Structure 1"
indicated above can be prepared from functional derivatives of ibuprofen, (for example acid
halides or mixed anhydrides), by reaction with suitable alcohols, thiols, or amines. The
positively charged amino groups of these pro-drugs not only largely increases the solubility
of the drugs, but also bonds to the negative charge on the phosphate head group of
membranes and pushes the pro-drug into the cytosol. The experiment results suggest that the
pro-drug, diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH, diffuses through human
skin -250 times faster than ibuprofen itself and -125 times faster than ethyl 2 -(p
isobutylphenyl) propionate. In plasma, more than 90% of these pro-drugs can change back to
the drug in a few minutes. The prodrugs can be used medicinally in treating any ibuprofen
treatable conditions in humans or animals and be administered not only orally, but also
transdermally for any kind of medical treatments and avoid most of the side effects of
ibuprofen, most notably GI disturbances such as dyspepsia, gastroduodenal bleeding, gastric
ulcerations, and gastritis. Controlled transdermal administration systems of the prodrug
enables the ibuprofen to reach constantly optimal therapeutic blood levels to increase
effectiveness and reduce the side effects of ibuprofen.

                                       Background Art
     Ibuprofen is a member of the propionic acid group of nonsteroidal anti
 inflammatory drugs. The synthesis of ibuprofen was originally reported in 1964 (J.S.
 Nicholson and S.S. Adams, Br. Patent No. 971, 700) and first used medicinally in
 Europe. Ibuprofen is more potent than aspirin in anti-inflammatoty and prostaglandin
 biosynthesis inhibition assays. 'PDR Generics' (PDR Generics, 1996, second edition,
 Medical Economics, Montvale, New Jersey, pg 243) has listed many medical uses of
 ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is used fur the relief of rheumatoid arthritis and ostecarthritis
 symptoms, the reduction of fever, and the treatment of dysmenorrhea. Ibuprofen is
 used alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of Bartter's syndrome and chronic uveitis,
 both anterior and posterior. It is also used in IUD-associated uterine bleeding, and pro,
 phylactically to reduce the severity of nausea and prevent radiation-induced vomiting
 in patients receiving pelvic irradiation. Ibuprofen is also prescribed for diabetic
 neuropathy, acute migraine headaches, and is used in hemophilic arthropathy. It is also
 used in the treatment of bone loss (Jee; Webster S. S. U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,259),
 prevention or treatment of sunburn (Sunshine: Abraham. U.S. Pat. No. 5,100,918)
     Unfortunately, a number of side effects are associated with the use of ibuprofen,
 most notably GI disturbances such as dyspepsia, gastroduodenal bleeding, gastric ul
 cerations, and gastritis. Fishman (Fishman; Robert, U.S. Pat. No. 7,052,715) indicated
 that an additional problem associated with oral medications, is that the concentration
 levels which must be achieved in the bloodstream must be significant in order to ef
 fectively treat distal areas of pain or inflammation. These levels are often much higher
 than would be necessary if it were possible to accurately target the particular site of
 pain or injury. Fishman and many others (Van Engelen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,416,772;
 Macrides et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,346,278; Kirby et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,444,234, Pearson
 et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,528,040, and Botknecht et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,597) have tried
 to develop a delivery system for transdernal application by formulatiom. It is very
 difficult, however, to deliver therapeutically effective plasma levels of ibuprofen into

    the host by formulation. Susan Milosovich, et. al. designed and prepared testosteronyl
    4-dimethylaminobutyrate.HC1 (TSBH), which has a lipophilic portion and a tertiary
    amine groups that exists in the protonated form at physiological pH. They found that
    the prodrug (TSBH) diffuses through human skin -60 times faster than does the drug
    (TS) itself [Susan Milosovich, et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 82, 227(1993).
    Disclosure of Invention
                                        Technical Problem
[4]     Ibuprofen has been used medicinally for more than 30 years and ibuprofen is more
    potent than aspirin in anti-inflammatory and prostaglandin biosynthesis inhibition.
    Ibuprofen is indicated for the relief of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis
    symptoms, the relief of mild to moderate pain, the reduction of fever, and the treatment
    of dysmenorrhea. Ibuprofen is used alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of Bartter's
    syndrome and chronic uveitis, both anterior and posterior. Ibuprofen is also prescribed
    for diabetic neuropathy, acute migraine headaches, and is used in hemophilic
    arthropathy. It is also used in IUD-associated uterine bleeding, and prophylactically to
    reduce the severity of nausea and prevent radiation-induced vomiting in patients
    receiving pelvic irradiation.
[5]     Unfortunately, a number of side effects are associated with the use of ibuprofen,
    most notably GI disturbances such as dyspepsia, heartburn, vomiting, gastroduodenal
    bleeding, gastric ulcerations, and gastritis. Gastroduodenal bleeding induced by
    ibuprofen is generally painless but can lead to fecal blood loss and may cause a
    persistent iron deficiency anemia.
                                        Technical Solution
[6]     This invention relates to the preparation of novel positively charged pro-drugs of
    ibuprofen and their use medicinally. These pro-drugs have the general formula (1)
    "Structure 1".
                 CH 3

    having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, or aryl residues; R2 represents H, one of any alkyl,

                                                                                          R3

    AcO, citrate, or any negative ions; and n=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10...... All R groups may

                                                                                     Any CH2
    groups may be replaced with 0, S, or NH.
[7]      Drug absorption, whether from the gastrointestinal tract or other sites, requires the
    passage of the drug in a molecular form across the barrier membrane. The drug must
    first dissolve, and if the drug possesses the desirable biopharmaceutical properties, it
    will pass from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration across
    the membrane into the blood or general circulation. All biological membranes contain
    lipids as major constituents. The molecules that play the dominant roles in membrane
    formation all have phosphate-containing highly polar head groups, and, in most cases,
    two highly hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails. Membranes are bilayers, with the hy
    drophilic head groups facing outward into the aqueous regions on either side. Very hy
    drophilic drugs cannot pass the hydrophobic layer of membrane and very hydrophobic
    drugs will stay in the hydrophobic layer as part of the membrane due to their sim
    ilarities and cannot enter the cytosol on the inside efficiently.
[8]      The goal of this invention is to avoid the side effects of ibuprofen by increasing the
    solubility of ibuprofen in gastric juice and the penetration rate of ibuprofen through the
    membrane and skin barrier which will make it administrable transdermally (topical ap
    plication). These novel pro-drugs of ibuprofen have two structural features in common:
    they have a lipophilic portion and a primary, secondary, or tertiary amine group that
    exists in the protonated form hydrophilicc part) at physiological pH. Such a hy
    drophilic-lipophilic balance is required for efficient passage through the membrane
    barrier [Susan Milosovich, et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 82, 227(1993)]. The positively
    charged amino groups largely increase the solubility of the drugs. The solubility of di
    ethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate. AcOH and 2-(p-isobutylphenyl)
    propionic acid (ibuprofen) in water were >300 mg and 0.05 mg/ml. In many instances,
    the slowest or rate-limiting step in the sequence is the dissolution of the drug.
    Ibuprofen has a very low solubility in gastric juice. It stays in the GI tract for a long
    time and thus, may cause gastric mucosal cell damage. When these new pro-drugs are
    administered orally in a dosage form such as a tablet, capsule, solution, or suspension,
    they will dissolve in the gastric juice immediately. The positive charge on the amino
    groups of these pro-drugs will bond to the negative charge on the phosphate head
    group of membrane. Thus, the local concentration of the outside of the membrane will
    be very high and will facilitate the passage of these pro-drugs from a region of high
    concentration to a region of low concentration. When these pro-drugs enter the
    membrane, the hydrophilic part will push the pro-drug into the cytosol, a semi-liquid

     concentrated aqueous solution or suspension. Due to the short stay in GI tract, the pro
     drugs will not cause gastric mucosal cell damage.
[9]      The penetration rates of diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH
     and 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid through human skin were measured in vitro by
     using modified Franz cells, which were isolated from human skin tissue (360-400 pm
     thick) of the anterior and posterior thigh areas. The receiving fluid consisted of 10 ml
     of 2% bovine serum albumin in normal saline and was stirred at 600 rpm. The
     cumulative amounts of 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid (ibuprofen) and diethy
     laminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH penetrating the skin versus time
     were determined by a specific high-performance liquid chromatography method. The
     results using a donor consisting of either a 30% suspension of 2-(p-isobutylphenyl)
     propionic acid (ibuprofen) and ethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate and 30% solution
     of diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH in 2mL of pH 7.4
     phosphate buffer (0.2M) are shown in Figure 1. Apparent flux values of 0.5 mg, 1 mg
     and 125 mg/cm2/h were calculated for ibuprofen, ethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate
     (the non positive charged normal ester of 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid), and di
     ethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate. AcOH. The results suggest that the
     pro-drug, diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH diffuses through
     human skin -250 times faster than does 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid itself and
     -125 times faster than does ethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate. The normal ester,
     ethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate and 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid itself
     have very similar penetration rates (only 2 times difference). The results suggest that
     the positive charge on the dialkyaninoethyl group has a very important role in the
     passage of the drug across the membrane and skin barrier. Other prodrugs of the
     general "Structure 1" have very high penetration rates and are very close to that of di
     ethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH.
[10]     The in vivo rates of penetration of 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid (IBPP) and
     diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH (DEAE-IBPP) through the
     skin of intact hairless mice were compared. The donor consisted of either a 30%
     solution of 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid (IBPP) or diethylaminoethyl
     2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH (DEAE-IBPP) in 1 mL of isopropanol applied
               2
     to a 1 cm on the backs of the hairless mice. Plasma levels of ibuprofen and diethy
     laminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate were determined by a specific high
     performance liquid chromatography method. The results (Figure 2) show that the peak
     levels of diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate were reached -30 minutes
     after application of the donor systems. It takes 1-2 hours for ibuprofen to reach the
     peak ibuprofen level when it is taken orally. The peaks were -0.2 mg/ml for
     2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid (ibuprofen) or -12 mg/ml for diethylaminoethyl

     2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH (approximately 60 times difference). -12 mg/
     ml of 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid in plasma is more than 30 times higher than
     the 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid plasma level for effective analgesia and
     effective antiinflammatory activity. This is a very exciting result. It will be very easy
     and fast to deliver therapeutically effective plasma levels of 2-(p-isobutylphenyl)
     propionic acid into the host by these pro-drugs. These results suggest that the pro-drugs
     can be administered not only orally, but also transdermally for any kind of medical
     treatments. The in vivo rates of penetration of other Pro-drugs of the general "Structure
      1" are close to that of diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH .
[11]      To check the gastroduodenal bleeding caused by drugs, rats (two groups, each
     group had 10 rats) were orally administered with 100 mg/kg of ibuprofen or diethy
     laminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH per day for 21 days. We found an
     average of 4 mg of fecal blood per gram of feces in the ibuprofen group and none in di
     ethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH group.
[12]      Ibuprofen has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic, and an
     tirheumatic activity. A good prodrug should go back to the drug itself in plasma. Di
     ethylaminoethyl ester group of diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl)
     propionate.AcOH can be rapidly cleaved by the enzymes in human plasma in vitro and
     more than 90% of the pro-drug is changed back to ibuprofen. Due to the pro-drug
     having a much better absorption rate, the prodrug will have more strength than
     ibuprofen itself at the same dosage. The analgetic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory
     activities of diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH were tested
     using ibuprofen as a comparison. Other compounds of the general 'Structure 1' were
     tested by the same methods and have very similar results as that of diethylaminoethyl
     2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH.
[13]      Analgetic activity: The prolongation time of pain the threshold of a mouse tail was
     determined in accordance with the D'Amour-Smith Method (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther.,
     72, 74(1941)). After 200mg/kg of ibuprofen was administered orally and 200mg/kg of
     diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH was administered orally and
     transdermally, the tails of mice were exposed to heat and the prolongation time of pain
     threshold was determined. The results obtained are shown in Figure 3. The groups ad
     ministered 200 mg/kg of diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH
     orally (C) and transdermally (D) were shown to exhibit stronger analgetic activity than
     the group administered 200 mg/kg of ibuprofen.
[14]      The number of writhings that occurred when mice were administered an acetic acid
     solution intraperitoneally were counted, and the rate of inhibition based on the control
     group was calculated. 42 mice were divided into 7 groups (6 mice each). Ibuprofen
     (IBPP, 50 mg/kg and 100 mg) was administered to groups B 1 and B2 of mice and di-

     ethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH (DEAE-IBPP, 50 mg and 100
     mg/kg) was administered orally to groups C1 and C2. Diethylaminoethyl
     2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH (DEAE-IBPP, 50 mg and 100 mg/kg) was ad
     ministered transdermally to groups Diand D2. The A group is the control group. The
     test compounds were administered to the mice 30 minutes before the acetic acid
     solution was administered. The results are shown in Table 1.

[15]     The results show that diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH
     demonstrates better analgetic activity than ibuprofen. Other compounds of the general
     'Structure 1' show similar analgetic activity.
[16]     Antipyretic activity: Rats received a sterilized E. coli suspension as a pyrogen. 56
     rats were divided into 7 groups. The control group is group A. 2 hours later, ibuprofen
     (IBPP, B 1 for 100mg/kg and B2 for 150mg/kg) and diethylaminoethyl
     2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH (DEAE-IBPP, C1 for 100mg/kg and C2 for
      150 mg) were administered orally and diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl)
     propionate.AcOH (DEAE-IBPP, D1 for 100 mg and D2 for 150 mg/kg) was ad
     ministered transdermally. The body temperatures of the rats were taken at 90 min.
     intervals before and after the administration of the test compounds. The results are
     shown in Table 2.

[17]     The results shown that diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH
     demonstrated antipyretic activity at 100 mg/kg dose and better than ibuprofen. The
     results show that transdermal administration of diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl)
     propionate.AcOH is better than oral administration. Other compounds of the general
     "Structure 1" show similar antipyretic activity.
[18]     Anti-inflammatory activity: 50 mg/kg of diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl)
     propionate.AcOH was administered orally or transdermally to rats and 50 mg/kg of
     ibuprofen was administered orally. 60 minutes later, a carrageenin solution was ad
     ministered subcutaneously to the foot pads of the rats. The volume of the hind paw was
     measured at every hour after the administration of the carrageenin, and the rate of
     increase in the volume of the paw was calculated and designated as the rate of swelling
     (%). The results obtained are shown in Figure 4. The results show that diethy
     laminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH by oral administration and
     transdermal administration demonstrated better Anti-inflammatory activity than that of
     ibuprofen at 50mg/kg by oral administration. Other compounds of the general
     'Structure 1' show similar anti-inflammatory activity.
[19]     It is also known that a high dose of oral ibuprofen shows an anti
     reactive-antiasthmatic activity by inhibition of the cyclooxygenase activity. Due to
     their very high membrane penetration rate, these prodrugs can be used in treating
     asthma by spraying into the mouth or nose of the host. They can also be used to treat
     acne due to their anti-inflammatory properties.
[20]      The compounds of the general formula (1) "Structure 1" indicated above can be
     prepared from ibuprofen or from functional derivatives of ibuprofen, for example, acid
     halides or mixed anhydrides of the general formula (2) 'Structure 2'.

[24]     The present invention relates to pharmaceutical preparations comprising of pro
     drugs of ibuprofen of the general "Structure 1" in addition to customary auxiliaries and
     excipients, e.g. in the form of tablets, capsules or solutions for administration orally
     and in the form of solutions, lotion, ointment, emulsion or gel for administration
     transdermally. The new active compounds of the general "Structure 1" can be
     combined with vitamins such as A, B, C or E or beta-carotene, or other pharma
     ceuticals, such as folic acid, etc. for treating any ibuprofen-treatable conditions in
     humans or animals.
[25]     It is also known that ibuprofen shows an anti-reactive-antiasthmatic activity by
     inhibition of the cyclooxygenase activity. Due to their very high membrane penetration
     rate, these pro-drugs can be used in treating asthma by spraying into the mouth or nose
     of the host.
[26]     They can also be used to treat acne and other skin disorders due to their anti
     inflammatory properties. They can be used for the treatment and prevention of
     endothelia dysfunction as well.
[27]     These pro-drugs are water-soluble neutral salt and can be tolerated very well by the
     eye. They can be used for treating eye inflammatory diseases, for treating of ocular
     pain after corneal surgery, for treating glaucoma or for treating ear inflammatory and/
     or painful conditions (otitis).
[28]     Transdermal therapeutic application systems of compounds of the general
     "Structure 1" or a composition comprising at least one compound of the general
     "Structure 1", as an active ingredient, can be used for treating any ibuprofen-treatable
     conditions in humans or animals. These systems can be a bandage or a patch
     comprising of one active substance-containing matrix layer and an impermeable

     backing layer. The most preferable system is an active substance reservoir, which has a
     permeable bottom facing the skin. By controlling the rate of release, this system
     enables ibuprofen to reach constantly optimal therapeutic blood levels to increase ef
     fectiveness and reduce the side effects of ibuprofen. These systems can be worn on the
     wrist, ankle, arm, leg, or any part of body.
[29]
                                       Advantageous Effects
[30]     These pro-drugs of ibuprofen have a lipophilic portion and a hydrophilic portion
     (the amine groups that exist in the protonated form at physiological pH). The positively
     charged amino groups of these pro-drugs have two major advantages. First, it largely
     increases the solubility of the drugs; when these new pro-drugs are administered orally
     in a dosage form such as a tablet, capsule, solution, or suspension, they will dissolve in
     gastric juice immediately. Second, the positive charge on the amino group of these pro
     drugs will bond to the negative charge on the phosphate head group of membrane.
     Thus, the local concentration outside of the membrane will be very high and will
     facilitate the passage of these pro-drugs from a region of high concentration to a region
     of low concentration. When these pro-drugs enter the membrane, the hydrophilic part
     will push the pro-drugs into the cytosol, a semi-liquid concentrated aqueous solution or
     suspension. Due to the short stay in the GI tract, the pro-drugs will not cause gastric
     mucosal cell damage. Experiment results show that more than 90% of the pro-drug was
     changed back to the drug itself. The pro-drugs have a much better absorption rate, and
     thus the pro-drugs will have better strength than the ibuprofen itself at the same
     dosage. The experiment results suggest that the pro-drug, diethylaminoethyl
     2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH, diffuses through human skin -250 times faster
     than ibuprofen itself and -125 times faster than ethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.
     The in vivo rates of penetration of diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl)
     propionate.AcOH through the skin of intact hairless mice were very high. It takes 1-2
     hours for ibuprofen tablets to reach the peak ibuprofen plasma level when it is taken
     orally, but diethylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH only took about
     30 minutes to reach the peak ibuprofen plasma level. The most exciting result is that
     the pro-drugs can be administered not only orally, but also transdermally for any type
     of medical treatment and should avoid most of the side effects of ibuprofen, most
     notably GI disturbances such as dyspepsia, gastroduodenal bleeding, gastric ul
     cerations, and gastritis. Another great benefit of transdermal administration of these
     pro-drugs is that administering medication, especially to children, will be much easier.

       Preparation of dipropylaminoethyl 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionate.AcOH
[43]     60 g of Polymer-bound triethylamine (3 mmol/g, 100-200 mesh) was suspended in
      180 ml of chloroform. 20.6 g (0.1 mol) of 2-(p-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid was
     added into the mixture with stirring. 43 g (0.15mol) of dipropylaminoethyl
     bromide.HBr was added into the mixture and the mixture was stirred for 5 hours at RT.
     The polymer was removed by filtration and washed with tetrahydrofuran ( 3 x 50 ml).
     8.2 g (0.1 mol) of sodium acetate was added into the reaction mixture with stirring.
     The mixture was stirred for 2 h. The solid was removed by filtration and washed with
     chloroform (3 x 50 ml). The solution was concentrated in vacuo to 100 ml. Then 300
     ml of hexane was added into the solution. The solid product was collected by filtration
     and washed with hexane (3 x 100 ml). After drying, it yielded 36 g of the desired
     product (91.5%). Hygroscopic product; Solubility in water: 350 mg/ml; Elementary

                                     Industrial Applicability
[44]      The pro-drugs of the general formula (1) "Structure 1" are superior to ibuprofen.
     They may be used medicinally in treating any ibuprofen-treatable conditions in
     humans or animals. They may be used for the relief of signs and symptoms of

rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, the reduction of fever, and the treatment of dys
menorrhea. They are used alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of Bartter's syndrome
and chronic uveitis, both anterior and posterior. It is also used in IUD-associated
uterine bleeding, and prophylactically to reduce the severity of nausea and prevent
radiation-induced vomiting in patients receiving pelvic irradiation. They are also
prescribed for diabetic neuropathy and acute migraine headaches and are used in
hemophilic arthropathy. They are also used in treatment of bone loss, prevention or
treatment of sunburn. They may be used in the prevention of cancer. Due to their very
high membrane penetration rate, these pro-drugs can be used in treating asthma by
inhalation to a host. They can be used to treat acne due to their anti-inflammatory
properties. These pro-drugs are water-soluble neutral salt and can be tolerated very
well by the eye. They can be used for treating eye inflammatory diseases, for treating
of ocular pain after corneal surgery, for treating glaucoma or for treating ear in
flammatory and/or painful conditions (otitis).
