                          Agile Mounting System For Linear Lighting
FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY
[001]       This disclosure relates generally to a mounting system for linear lighting, and more
particularly to an agile mounting system for linear lighting comprising a continuous luminaire
and at least a mounting bracket.
BACKGROUND
[002]       Typically, for the installation of a surface mounted linear lighting system, there is a
need for a housing to be fixed to the mounting surface, luminaire segments to be joined and
transformer wired prior to final assembly of the product. The installation methods of the
existing linear lighting solutions involve a high proportion of the final product to be
assembled on site since the final product needs to be disassembled for installation.
[003]      Further, the installation of existing linear lighting systems on different mounting
surfaces requires varied installation techniques thereby increasing the complexity and
duration of installation. For example a typical linear lighting system may consist of recessed,
surface mounted and suspended luminaires within the same space and each mounting method
requires a different installation technique. Thus, a homogenous linear lighting installation
process across multiple mounting surfaces is not available.
[004]       The existing solutions provides several alternatives to reduce the complexity of
typical linear lighting installation. The existing installation methods offer detailed installation
diagrams to the end user or provide qualified installers who know the system to remove the
learning curve. As a result, on-site labour is required to install a linear lighting system.
Further, the existing installation methods make use of electrical connectors on multiple pre
assembled sections, or make use of snap-fit light engines to speed up assembly into the
luminaire housing. Moreover, an alternative of shipping longer sections is also considered to
limit the amount ofjoints in the installation.
[005]      Furthermore, while installing a linear lighting traditional system, the installer may
be on a ladder for majority of the installation working on segments of the luminaire which are
directly above the installer. Working in this position limits access, increasing the duration of
tasks and over a period of time, causing strain to the installer due to unfavourable body

position. In addition, it is not easy for the installer to carry all the required tools or
components while installing the linear lighting and therefore, the installer may need to do
multiple trips up and down the ladder thereby increasing the installation time.
SUMMARY
[006]       In order to solve at least some of the above mentioned problems, an agile or a
quick mounting system for linear lighting is needed. A mounting system facilitating reduction
in time, error and complexity for installation of linear lighting with the incorporation of a
quick mounting system that removes the need to disassemble the final product for installation
is needed. A system that reduces the complexity as the installation technique and avoids the
installers multiple trips up and down the ladder is needed.
[007]      Briefly, according to an exemplary embodiment, an agile mounting system for
linear lighting is provided. The agile mounting system for linear lighting includes a
continuous luminaire and at least one mounting bracket. The continuous luminaire includes at
least one segment of a light source housing and a light source. The continuous luminaire also
includes a light engine thermally bonded to the light source housing and the light source. The
at least one mounting bracket includes a fixing surface and a resiliently flexible member. The
fixing surface is positioned adjacent to a mounting surface when installed and the resiliently
flexible member is extending perpendicular to the fixing surface for receiving the continuous
light source housing via a snap-fit engagement.
[008]       The summary above is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way
limiting. Further aspects, exemplary embodiments, and features will become apparent by
reference to the drawings and the following detailed description.

[0019]      At least one exemplary embodiment is generally directed toward an agile mounting
system for linear lighting. The agile mounting system for linear lighting includes a
continuous luminaire and at least one mounting bracket. The continuous luminaire includes at
least one segment of a light source housing and a light source. The at least one mounting
bracket includes a fixing surface and a resiliently flexible member. The fixing surface is
positioned adjacent to a mounting surface when installed and the resiliently flexible member
is extending perpendicular to the fixing surface for receiving the continuous light source
housing via a snap-fit engagement.
[0020]      The system as disclosed in the present disclosure reduces time and complexity of a
linear lighting system installation. In one embodiment, the present disclosure discloses an
agile or a quick mounting system that removes the need to disassemble the luminaire for
installation. The secondary benefit of the agile mounting system is the consistency in the
installation methods across multiple mounting surfaces, further reducing the time and
complexity of a linear lighting system installation.
[0021]      Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the
same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this
invention belongs. The system, methods, and examples provided herein are illustrative only
and not intended to be limiting.

[00221      In addition to the illustrative aspects, exemplary embodiments, and features
described above, further aspects, exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure will
become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description.
[00231      FIG. 1 illustrates an agile mounting system 100 featuring its profile view 100-A
and another profile view 100-B with assembled segment that is configured for installation of
linear lighting, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. In particular, the profile
view 100-A of the agile mounting system 100 illustrates a fixing surface 102, a mounting
bracket 104, a resiliently flexible member 106, a luminaire 108, a light source housing 110, a
light engine 112, and a light source 114.
[00241      In one embodiment, the FIG. 1 illustrates the agile mounting system 100
configured for installation of linear lighting that removes the need to disassemble the
luminaire (continuous luminaire 108) during the process of installation. The secondary
benefit of the quick mounting system 100 is the consistency in the installation method across
multiple mounting surfaces, further reducing the time and complexity of the linear lighting
system installation.
[0025]      Referring to FIG. 1, the agile mounting system 100 includes at least one mounting
bracket 104 comprising the fixing surface 102 adjacent to the mounting surface when
installed and the resiliently flexible member 106 extending generally perpendicular to the
fixing surface 102 for receiving the continuous light source housing 110 via snap-fit
engagement.
[0026]      The agile mounting system 100 further comprises the continuous luminaire 108. In
one embodiment, the continuous luminaire 108 includes at least one segment of a light source
housing 110 and light source 114. The continuous luminaire also includes a light engine
thermally bonded to the light source housing and the light source. The resiliently flexible
member 106 required for the snap fit engagement could be on the light source housing 110
instead of the mounting bracket 104.
[00271      In one example embodiment, during the process of installation the continuous
luminaire 108 can be assembled and wired at the desired position of the installer prior fixing
to the mounting surface via the at least one mounting bracket 104. In another embodiment,
the at least one mounting bracket 104 can be modified for various mounting methods
including recessed, surface mounted and suspended linear systems.

[00281      In one embodiment, the continuous luminaire 108 includes a light engine 112
which is thermally bonded to the light source 114 and light source housing 110. The light
engine 112 is assembled with the light source housing 110 via a rail type engagement. When
assembled (as shown by reference numeral 100-B), the length of the light engine 112 and
light source housing 110 are offset such that the offset provides rigidity at the join of two
segments, wherein the one segment includes the light source 114 and the light source housing
110 and the light engine 112 whilst also preventing light leaks. In the preferred embodiment
the force required to disengage the light source housing 110 from the mounting bracket 104 is
less than the force required to disengage the mounting bracket 104 from the mounting surface
such that the mounting surface is not damaged when servicing the luminaire 108.
[0029]      In one example embodiment, the continuous luminaire 108 could be fixed to the
mounting bracket 104 via magnetic force instead of a snap fit. In another embodiment, the
luminaire 108 could be fixed to the mounting bracket 104 via a push-to-close latch instead of
a snap fit. In yet another embodiment, luminaire 108 could be fixed to the mounting bracket
104 via any combination of the above retention methods.
[0030]      FIG. 2 illustrates an isometric view 200-A and a side view 200-B of the agile
mounting system 100 of FIG 1., with assembled segment that is configured for installation of
linear lighting, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to FIG. 2, the
offset length 202 is used to provide rigidity between the segments, wherein the one segment
includes the light source 114 and the light source housing 110 and the light engine 112 whilst
also preventing light leaks.
[0031]      FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 illustrates the step by step installation process of the agile
mounting system, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to FIG. 3,
disassembled segments of a continuous luminaire are shown as shown by reference numeral
300-A. The continuous luminaire are shown as shown by reference numeral 300-A are
shipped to the installation site. The assembled segments of a continuous luminaire are shown
by reference numeral 300-B. In one embodiment, the segments are joined on-site in the
preferred location of installer. The joining of segments is easy task (may be plug and play)
for the installer. In FIG.4, the image 400-A shows a surface mounted bracket. The mounting
bracket is fixed to the mounting surface. Further, the image 400-B shows a continuous
luminaire fixed to the mounting bracket. In one embodiment, the assembled luminaire is
fixed to mounting surface.

[00321      FIG. 5 illustrates the step by step installation process (alternative perspective) of
the agile mounting system, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring
to FIG. 5, disassembled segments of a continuous luminaire are shown as shown by reference
numeral 502-A. The continuous luminaire are shown as shown by reference numeral 502-A
are shipped to the installation site. The assembled segments of a continuous luminaire are
shown by reference numeral 502-B. In one embodiment, the segments are joined on-site in
the preferred location of installer. Referring to FIG. 5, the image 504-A shows a surface
mounted bracket. The mounting bracket is fixed to the mounting surface. Further, the image
504-B shows a continuous luminaire fixed to the mounting bracket. In one embodiment, the
assembled luminaire is fixed to mounting surface.
[0033]      FIG. 6 illustrates various mounting bracket configurations for different mounting
surfaces, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to FIG. 6, all
mounting brackets use the same bracket-light source housing assembly method. The
mounting bracket for surface mount is shown by reference numeral 602. The mounting
bracket for recessed mount trimless is shown by reference numeral 604. The mounting
bracket for suspended mount is shown by reference numeral 606. The mounting bracket for
surface mount 90 degree is shown by reference numeral 608. The mounting bracket for
recessed mount is shown by reference numeral 610.
[00341      While specific language has been used to describe the disclosure, any limitations
arising on account of the same are not intended. As would be apparent to a person skilled in
the art, various working modifications may be made to the method in order to implement the
inventive concept as taught herein. The figures and the foregoing description give examples
of embodiments. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that one or more of the described
elements may well be combined into a single functional element. Alternatively, certain
elements may be split into multiple functional elements. Elements from one embodiment may
