        A stand-alone, roadway barrier includes:          an internal
   structural framework 5, 7, 9 which provides the barrier
 5 with rigidity for resisting collapse of the barrier in
   response to impact of a vehicle, panels 13 mounted to
   opposite sides of the structural framework for deflecting
   vehicles on impact with the barrier; and ballast 33 in a
   lower section of the barrier for contributing to the
10 weight of the barrier.

                         ROADWAY BARRIER
             The present invention relates to a barrier for
   roadways.

             The present invention relates particularly,
   although by no means exclusively, to a stand-alone, self
   supporting, lightweight and readily portable metal                (which
   term includes metal alloy) roadway barrier.

             Known roadway barriers include:
              (a) barriers made from concrete that rely on
                  the weight of the concrete to function as
                  barriers and typically weigh 1,000 kg per
15                meter of the length of the barrier;
              (b) barriers that comprise shells made from
                  plastics materials that are adapted to be
                  filled with water and rely on the weight of
                  the water to function as barriers and
20                typically weigh at least 300 kg per meter
                  of the length of the barrier;         and
              (c) barriers made from steel which also rely on
                  the weight of the barriers to function as
                  barriers and weigh at least 200 kg per
25                meter of the length of the barrier and, in
                  many instances are fixed to the ground.
             Whilst the above-described barriers function
   effectively as barriers, principally due to the
30 substantial weights thereof, the substantial weights of
   the concrete barriers and the steel barriers present
   significant transportation difficulties, and the need to
   fill water into and thereafter empty water from the
   plastics materials shell barriers presents significant
35 handling issues and increases installation times
   considerably.  In addition, concrete barriers and the
   water-filled barriers tend to crack when impacted by
                                         10424372_1 (GHMatters) P93905.AU.229/06/18

                              - 2
   vehicles and lose functionality as a consequence and
   invariably cannot be used as barriers after a vehicle
   impact.  Moreover, the construction of these barriers,
   particularly the concrete barriers and the steel barriers,
 5 means that the barriers have no "give" on impact of a
   vehicle.  A certain amount of resilience of a barrier on
   vehicle impact is helpful.
             There is a need for a lightweight barrier that
10 functions effectively as a barrier and can be readily be
   lifted into and from required roadway locations and is
   immediately functional as a barrier when lifted into
   position.
15           The above description of prior art barriers is
   not to be taken as an admission of the common general
   knowledge in Australia or elsewhere.
             The present invention provides a stand-alone,
20 self-supporting, lightweight, portable roadway barrier
   that includes:
        (a)  an internal structural framework which provides
             the barrier with rigidity for resisting collapse
             of the barrier in response to impact of a
25           vehicle, the framework including interconnected
             framework members, the framework members
             including upright members at opposite ends of
             the barrier, and at least one longitudinal
             member extending along the length of the barrier
30           and connected to each of the upright members;
        (b)  panels mounted to opposite sides of the
             structural framework and forming the sides of
             the barrier for deflecting vehicles on impact
             with the barrier;  and
35      (c)  ballast in a lower section of the barrier for
             contributing to the weight of the barrier.
                                         10424372_1 (GHMatters) P93905.AU.229/06/18

                              - 3
             The purpose of the internal structural framework
   of the above-described barrier is to provide sufficient
   rigidity for resisting collapse of the barrier in response
   to vehicle impact.   Specifically, the interconnected
 5 arrangement of upright and longitudinal framework members
   is provided to give the framework sufficient rigidity for
   resisting direct collapse of the barrier in the regions of
   vehicle impact and from uncontrolled twisting of the
   barrier around a longitudinal barrier axis.           The upright
10 members of the structural framework also act as supports
   for the side panels.
             Typically, the internal structural framework
   provides at least 80%, more typically at least 90%,                 of the
15 rigidity for resisting collapse of the barrier in response
   to vehicle impact.
             The principal purpose of the side panels of the
   above-described barrier is to deflect a vehicle on impact
20 of the vehicle against the barrier.   Accordingly, it is
   not essential that the side panels make a substantial
   contribution to the rigidity of the barrier and this makes
   it possible to minimise the weight of the side panels.
   Typically, the side panels contribute no more than 30% of
25 the rigidity of the barrier.
             The principal purpose of the ballast is to
   provide weight to resist shunting action on vehicle impact
   that would move the barrier significantly from a preferred
30 position on the ground.
             The structural framework may include at least
   one upright member between the upright end members, with
   the longitudinal member being connected to the upright
35 member or members.
                                          10424372_1 (GHMatters) P93905.AU.229/06/18

                              - 4
             The structural framework may include a central
   upright member positioned midway between the upright end
   members.
 5           The central upright member may include an
   opening that can receive a crane hook to facilitate
   lifting of the barrier.
             The upright members may be in the form of steel
10 plates.
             The upright members may be in the form of steel
   plates that extend across the width of the barrier.
15           The steel plates may include mounting sections
   to which the side panels are connected.
             The longitudinal member or at least one of the
   longitudinal members may extend along the length of the
20 barrier and be connected at opposite ends to the upright
   end members and be connected to the or each upright member
   located between the upright end members.
             The longitudinal member or the lower
25 longitudinal member when there are two or more
   longitudinal members may be positioned at a height that is
   at or higher than 25% of the height of the barrier.
             The longitudinal member or the lower
30 longitudinal member when there are two or more
   longitudinal members may be positioned at a height that is
   at or higher than 50% of the height of the barrier.
             The longitudinal member or the lower
35 longitudinal member when there are two or more
   longitudinal members may be positioned at a height that is
   at or above a centre of gravity of a typical vehicle.
                                         10424372_1 (GHMatters) P93905.AU.229/06/18

                              - 5
             The applicant has found that the location of the
   longitudinal member or the lower longitudinal member when
   there are two or more longitudinal members as described in
 5 the three preceding paragraphs is preferable from the
   viewpoint of the overall rigidity of the barrier and in
   terms of minimising the possibility of lengthwise twisting
   of the barrier in response to vehicle impact.
10           The longitudinal member or at least one of the
   longitudinal members may be in the form of steel plates.
             The side panels may be made from steel.
15           The side panels may be made from steel strip
   that has been mechanically worked, such as by roll
   forming, into a required profile.  The required profile
   may be a profile that facilitates deflecting vehicles on
   impact.
20
             Each side panel may include a series of
   lengthwise extending corrugations that define panel ribs.
             The side panels on opposite sides of the barrier
25 may diverge outwardly from each other when viewed from the
   ends of the barrier.
             The height of the ballast may be lower than the
   height of the typical vehicle impact with the barrier.
30 This is an important feature so as to ensure that the
   structural framework and the side plates of the barrier
   respond to the vehicle impact by absorbing impact energy
   and deflecting impact, while the ballast resists shunting
   movement of the barrier.  This arrangement of the
35 components of the barrier provides an effective response
   to vehicle impact.
                                         10424372_1 (GHMatters) P93905.AU.229/06/18

                              - 6
             The ballast may be connected to the internal
   structural framework or to the side panels.
             The ballast may include a support element for
 5 mounting the ballast to the internal structural framework
   or to the side panels.
             The ballast may include a body, such as a block
   of a suitable ballast material, and a support element for
10 mounting the ballast to the internal structural framework
   or to the side panels.
             The support element may be in the form of a
   bracket, such as an angle iron bracket, that is bolted or
15 otherwise fastened to the body of the ballast and is
   adapted to cooperate with the internal structural
   framework or to the side panels to mount the ballast to
   the internal structural framework or to the side panels.
20           The ballast may include a plurality of blocks of
   a suitable ballast material positioned in spaces
   separating the upright end members and the upright member
   or members positioned between the upright end members.
25           The ballast may be made from concrete or any
   other suitable material.
             The weight of the ballast may be up to 55% of
   the total weight of the barrier.

             The weight of the ballast may be up to 50% of
   the total weight of the barrier.
             The weight of the ballast may be up to 45% of
35 the total weight of the barrier.
                                         10424372_1 (GHMatters) P93905.AU.229/06/18

             The weight of the barrier may be less that
   350 kg per meter of length of the barrier.
             The weight of the barrier may be less that
 5 300 kg per meter of length of the barrier.
             The weight of the barrier may be less that
   250 kg per meter of length of the barrier.
10           The weight of the structural framework and the
   side panels of the barrier may be less than 200 kg per
   meter of length of the barrier.
             The weight of the structural framework and the
15 side panels of the barrier may be less than 150 kg per
   meter of length of the barrier.
             The barrier further may include a lower side
   panel on each side of the barrier that prevents vehicle
20 tyres penetrating the barrier and becoming engaged with
   the barrier.
             The barrier may include complementary members at
   the ends of the barriers for allowing a plurality of
25 barriers to be connected together in end-to-end
   relationship in a line of the barriers.
             The barrier may be any suitable length.
30           Typically, the barrier is at least 3 m long.
             The present invention also provides a barrier
   assembly including a plurality of the above-described
   barrier connected together in end-to-end relationship in a
35 line of the barriers.

             The present invention is described further by
   way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing,
   of which:

   of a barrier in accordance with the present invention;

   shown in Figure 1 with the side panels and the ballast

   barrier;

   barrier shown in Figure 1 which shows the blocks of

   views of one of the ballast blocks and the brackets for
   connecting the ballast block to the internal structural
20 framework of the barrier.
             The barrier 3 shown in the Figures includes an
   internal structural framework of:
25           (a)  upright support plates 5 at opposite ends
                  of the barrier;
             (b)  three upright support plates 7 at spaced
                  intervals along the length of the barrier
30                between the end plates 5 and arranged to
                  extend across the width of the barrier;                   and
             (c)  a longitudinal support member 9           (best seen
                  in Figure 2)  in the form of a horizontally
35                disposed flat plate connected at opposite
                  ends to the upright end plates 5 and to the
                  internal upright plates 7;
                                         10424372_1 (GHMatters) P93905.AU.229/06/18

                              - 9
             The structural framework is made from steel.
   More particularly, the upright support plates 5,              7 and the
   longitudinal support member 9 are steel plates of any
 5 suitable gauge.
             The height of the longitudinal support member 9
   is selected to be at or higher than 25%, more preferably
   higher than 50%, more preferably higher than 60%, and
10 typically higher than 75%, of the height of the barrier 3.
   Typically, the selection is based the height of or greater
   than the height of a centre of gravity of a typical
   vehicle.
15           The barrier 3 further includes side panels 13
   that extend along the length of the barrier on opposite
   sides thereof and are connected to the upright support
   plates 5, 7 of the structural framework by bolts and or by
   welding the components together or by any other suitable
20 means.
             Each side panel 13 is made form steel and is
   corrugated and includes three parallel crests and two
   parallel troughs between the crests.   It can be
25 appreciated that the side panels 13 may be any suitable
   profile to facilitate deflecting vehicles on impact with
   the barrier 3.
             The side edges of the upper sections of the
30 upright support plates 5, 7 have a similar corrugated
   profile to that of the side panels 13.     In addition, the
   side edges of the upright support plates 5,        7 diverge
   outwardly to form a "christmas tree" formation when viewed
   from the ends of the barrier.  Consequently, the side
35 panels 13, as a consequence of being connected to the
   upright support plates 5, 7, diverge outwardly.
                                         10424372_1 (GHMatters) P93905.AU.229/06/18

                              - 10
              Each upright end plate 5 comprises an assembly
   which enables a plurality of the barriers 3 arranged end
   to-end to be hinged together to form a continuous line of
   the barriers, with the barriers in end-to-end
 5 relationship.   Each hinge assembly comprises four
   horizontally disposed and vertically spaced-apart hinge
   plates 17 having aligned openings 21.      The positions of
   the hinge plates 17 are selected so that the hinge plates
   17 at one end of one barrier 3 are above or below the
10 hinge plates at the other end of another barrier 3 when
   the barriers 3 are positioned end-to-end and the openings
   of the two sets of hinge plates 17 are aligned.
   Consequently, a hinge pin 33   (Figure 3) can be inserted
   through the aligned openings 21 to hinge the two barriers
15 together.
              The barrier 3 further includes 4 blocks 31 of
   ballast  (see Figure 3).
20            The ballast blocks 31 are made from concrete or
   any other suitable material.    The principal function of
   the ballast blocks 31 is to provide mass to resist
   shunting action on vehicle impact that would move the
   barrier significantly from a preferred position on the
25 ground.   The ballast blocks 31 make it possible for the
   barrier 3 to be used as a free-standing, self-supporting
   unit that can remain substantially in position on vehicle
   impact.
30            The ballast blocks 31 are formed to be located
   in a lower section of the barrier 3.     The height of the
   ballast blocks 31 is selected to be lower than the height
   of the typical vehicle impact with the barrier so as to
   ensure that the structural framework 5,      7,    9 and the side
35 panels 13 of the barrier 3 respond to the vehicle impact
   by absorbing impact energy and deflecting impact, while
   the ballast resists shunting movement of the barrier 3.
                                           10424372_1 (GHMatters) P93905.AU.229/06/18

                              -  11
   This arrangement of the components of the barrier 3
   provides an effective response to vehicle impact.
              The ballast blocks 31 are located in the spaces
 5 separating the upright end members 5 and the upright
   members 7 positioned between the upright end members 5 and
   are mounted to the side panels 13.        With reference to
   Figures 3 and 4, the ballast blocks 31 include support
   elements in the form of a pair of forward and rearward
10 angle iron brackets 35 that are bolted to the ballast
   blocks 31.   Figure 4 shows a single bolt 37 used to secure
   a bracket 35 to a ballast block 31.         In other embodiments,
   2 or more bolts or other suitable fasteners may be used to
   secure a bracket 35 to ballast block 31.              The brackets 35
15 have downturned ends that facilitate locating the ballast
   blocks 31 to the barrier 3, with the bracket ends resting
   on inwardly-turned sections of corrugations of the side
   panels 13 and thereby mounted to the side panels 13.                          With
   this arrangement, the ballast blocks 31 are not fixed to
20 the side panels 13. The weight of the ballast blocks 31
   keeps the blocks in position.       It can be appreciated the
   ballast blocks may be fixed to the side panels 13, for
   example by bolts  or other suitable     fasteners            (not shown)
   passing through openings   (not shown) in the brackets 35.

              In use, the barrier can be conveniently
   transported from a storage location to a roadside location
   and then lifted into position as a functional barrier.
30            Vehicle crash tests have been carried out on the
   barrier 3 by Crashlab (Registered Trade Mark),                  a
   commercial business unit of Roads and Maritime Services, a
   NSW Government agency and corporation incorporated under
   section 46 of the Transport Administration Act 1988                        (NSW).

   Mechanical Testing.

                              - 12
             The crash tests were conducted to the
   recommendations of the US National Cooperative Highway
   Research Program Report 350, tests 2-11 and 3-11.

   below:
      e Test 1 impact speed of 100km/hr.     59 barriers 3, each
        of effective length of 4.155 m   length and total
        weight of 885 kg (including 4 ballast blocks 31 with
10      a total weight of 435 kg, including the weight of the
        brackets 35),  were installed end to end, giving a
        total installation length of 246 m.        The centerline
        of the test vehicle was aligned with the intersection
