   conveyor 50, and the first rail set 10, the second rail set 20, the third rail set 30, and the parking
   rail set 60 have the same rail spacing. The conveyor 50 is provided with a wheel alignment slot
 0 (not shown) to allow the user to park the vehicle onto the conveyor 50 accurately. A stopper
   (not shown) is provided at the end of the parking rail set 60 to prevent the conveyor 50 from
   being parked beyond the parking rail set 60. The first locking device and the second locking
   device are electrically controlled locking devices. The number of movable rail segments 21 of
   each of the second rail sets 20 is equal to the number of a row of parking spaces extending in
 s the direction of the second rail set 20.
   [0035]    Intelligent parking carried out by using the above-described intelligent parking system
   is now described with reference to Figs 1 to 7. When the user needs to park a vehicle, the user
   opens the vehicle parking/picking-up application in the mobile phone to check whether there is
   a spare parking space in the stereo garage. If there is a spare parking space, the intelligent
20 parking system automatically allocates a parking space after the user chooses to park the
   vehicle; the user parks the vehicle onto the conveyor 50 in a direction parallel with the first rail
   set 10 from the entrance, as indicated, and the holding mechanism of the conveyor 50 holds the
   vehicle on the conveyor 50 and then sends a prompt sound to prompt the user to come out of
   the vehicle, the user comes out (for example, leave the vehicle via a slow step) and locks the
25 vehicle, and then selects automatic parking from the vehicle parking/picking-up application.
   After receiving the automatic parking command, the controller controls the conveyor 50 to
   move along the first rail set 10 and change a rail for the conveyor 50 to the corresponding
   second rail set 20 and parks the conveyor 50 on the corresponding movable rail segment 21
   according to the automatically allocated parking space (as shown in Figure 1), then the
                                                     8

   controller controls the second locking device to lock the conveyor 50 onto the corresponding
   support platform 40 (as shown in Figure 2), and the controller controls the elevating mechanism
   70 to be raised upward to a parking platform corresponding to the automatically allocated
   parking space (as shown in Figure 3), then rotates the movable platen 42 of the corresponding
 5 support platform 40 to align the corresponding movable rail segment 21 on the movable platen
   42 with the corresponding parking rail set (as shown in Figure 4), and controls the adjusting
   device to adjust the length of the movable platen 42 to bring the movable platen 42 into
   substantial abutment with the corresponding parking platform (as shown in Figure 5); then the
   controller controls the second locking device to be unlocked, and controls the conveyor 50 to
 0 move onto the corresponding parking rail set 60 (as shown in Figure 6). When the conveyor 50
   carrying the vehicle is completely parked onto the corresponding parking rail set 60, the
   controller controls the first locking device to lock the conveyor 50 onto the corresponding
   parking space; after the parking is completed, the controller controls the support platform 40 to
   return to its original position (as shown in Figure 7). The controller then sends parking
 s information comprising a parking position, a parking start time and a parking charge rate, and a
   two-dimensional     code corresponding to the parking information to the user's vehicle
   parking/picking-up application. When it is required to pick up the vehicle, the user pays the
   parking fee by scanning the two-dimensional code obtained in parking the vehicle on an
   automatic vehicle picking-up machine at the exit. After acquiring the parking charge
20 information, the controller controls the corresponding support platform 40 to be raised up to the
   corresponding parking space and controls the first locking device to be unlocked; then the
   controller rotates the movable platen 42 of the corresponding support platform, adjusts the
   movable platen 42 to extend, controls the conveyor 50 to travel to the movable rail segment 21
   on the corresponding support platform and controls the second locking device to lock the
25 conveyor 50 on the corresponding support platform. Subsequently, the controller restores the
   movable platen 42 to its original length and rotates the corresponding support platform to its
   original position, and the controller controls the elevating mechanism 70 to be lowered and
   aligns the corresponding movable rail segment 21 with other movable rail segments of the
   second rail set, then controls the conveyor 50 to pass through the second rail set 20 and reach
                                                    9

   the exit after the rail is switched to the third rail set 30. Then, the controller controls the second
   locking device to be unlocked, the holding of the vehicle by the holding mechanism is released,
   and the user enters the vehicle and drives it away from the conveyor 50 in a direction parallel
   with the first rail set 10, and leaves from the exit.
 5 [0036]    With the intelligent parking system provided by the utility model, fully automated
   parking is achieved. A user simply needs to park the vehicle onto the conveyor at the entrance,
   and the intelligent parking system automatically allocates a parking space, automatically parks
   the vehicle together with the conveyor carrying the vehicle into the parking space allocated
   automatically, and sends the parking information and charging information to a vehicle
 0 parking/picking-up application of the user. The user simply needs to pick up the vehicle through
   the vehicle parking/picking-up application when it is required to pick up the vehicle, the
   intelligent parking system completes the charging and automatically picks up the vehicle from
   the parking space where the vehicle is parked, and the user only needs to enter the vehicle at the
   exit, drive it away from the conveyor and leave the exit. With the intelligent parking system
 s according to the utility model, the parking efficiency and the utilization rate of the parking
   spaces can be greatly improved, and the space occupied by the parking lot is saved, which is
   advantageous for the construction of an intelligent city.
