filed March 30, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.
                                      TECHNICAL FIELD
[0002]    The present technology relates generally to compositions for preventing or treating
neuropathy comprising an aromatic-cationic peptide and methods for using the same.
                                        BACKGROUND
[0003]    The following description is provided to assist the understanding of the reader.
None of the information provided or the references cited are admitted to be prior art to the
present technology.
[0004]    Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy results in patient suffering and limits
the scope treatment with potentially useful anti-cancer drugs. Vinca alkaloids, such as
vincristine and vinblastine, have significant efficacy in the treatment of malignant tumors.
However, these agents are highly neurotoxic, frequently causing painful peripheral
neuropathies that limit the dose and duration of use in cancer treatment. These side effects
are dose and time dependent, often with latencies of days to weeks, and may be cumulative
with toxicities associated with other drugs used in combination with chemotherapeutic
agents.
                                           SUMMARY
[0005]    The present disclosure provides compositions and methods for treating or preventing
neuropathy or hyperalgesia comprising administering an aromatic-cationic peptide to a
subject in need thereof.
[0006]    In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for treating peripheral
neuropathy or hyperalgesia in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the
subject an effective amount of a peptide having the formula D-Arg-2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-

                                   DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0021]    The present disclosure is based on the surprising discovery that certain aromatic
cationic peptides can treat or ameliorate neuropathy and hyperalgesia, including drug-induced
neuropathy and hyperalgesia. It is to be appreciated that certain aspects, modes,
embodiments, variations, and features of the present technology are described below in
various levels of detail in order to provide a substantial understanding of the present
technology.
[0022]    In practicing the present technology, many conventional techniques in molecular
biology, protein biochemistry, cell biology, immunology, microbiology and recombinant
DNA are used. These techniques are well-known and are explained in, e.g., Current
                                                6

[0023]    The definitions of certain terms as used in this specification are provided below.
Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein generally have the
same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the
present technology belongs.
[0024]    As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an,"
and "the" include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. For example,
reference to "a cell" includes a combination of two or more cells, and the like.
[0025]    As used herein, "about" will be understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art
and will vary to some extent depending upon the context in which it is used. If there are uses
of the term which are not clear to persons of ordinary skill in the art, given the context in
which it is used, "about" will mean up to plus or minus 10% of the enumerated value.
[0026]    As used herein, the "administration" of an agent, drug, or peptide to a subject
includes any route of introducing or delivering to a subject a compound to perform its
intended function. Administration can be carried out by any suitable route, including orally,
intranasally, parenterally (intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or
subcutaneously), rectally, or topically. Administration includes self-administration and the
administration by another.
[0027]    As used herein, the term "amino acid" includes naturally-occurring amino acids and
synthetic amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function
in a manner similar to the naturally-occurring amino acids. Naturally-occurring amino acids
                                                7

    WO 2013/149172                                                          PCT/US2013/034647
are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified,
e.g., hydroxyproline, y-carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refers
to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally-occurring amino
acid, i.e., an a-carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an
R group, e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium.
Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but
retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally-occurring amino acid. Amino acid
mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general
chemical structure of an amino acid, but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally
occurring amino acid. Amino acids can be referred to herein by either their commonly
known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB
Biochemical Nomenclature Commission.
[0028]     As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers to a quantity sufficient to achieve
a desired therapeutic and/or prophylactic effect, e.g., an amount which results in the
prevention of, or a decrease in, a neuropathy or one or more conditions associated with a
neuropathy, including, but not limited to, hyperalgesia. In the context of therapeutic or
prophylactic applications, the amount of a composition administered to the subject will
depend on the type and severity of the neuropathy or hyperalgesia and on the characteristics
of the individual, such as general health, age, sex, body weight and tolerance to drugs. It will
also depend on the degree, severity, and type of the neuropathy or hyperalgesia. The skilled
artisan will be able to determine appropriate dosages depending on these and other factors.
The compositions can also be administered in combination with one or more additional
therapeutic compounds.
[0029]     An "isolated" or "purified" polypeptide or peptide is substantially free of cellular
material or other contaminating polypeptides from the cell or tissue source from which the
agent is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when
chemically synthesized. For example, an isolated aromatic-cationic peptide would be free of
materials that would interfere with therapeutic uses of the agent. Such interfering materials
may include enzymes, hormones and other proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous solutes.
[0030]     As used herein, the term "medical condition" includes, but is not limited to, any
condition or disease manifested as one or more physical and/or psychological symptoms for
                                                8

    WO 2013/149172                                                           PCT/US2013/034647
which treatment and/or prevention is desirable, and includes previously and newly identified
diseases and other disorders. For example, a medical condition may be a neuropathy, or any
associated conditions or complications, including, but not limited to, hyperalgesia.
[0031]    As used herein, "neuropathy" or "peripheral neuropathy" refers generally to damage
to nerves of the peripheral nervous system. The term encompasses neuropathy of various
etiologies, including, but not limited, to neuropathy caused by, resulting from, or associated
with genetic disorders, metabolic/endocrine complications, diabetes, inflammatory diseases,
vitamin deficiencies, malignant diseases, and toxicity, such as alcohol, organic metal, heavy
metal, radiation, and drug toxicity. As used herein, the term encompasses motor, sensory,
mixed sensorimotor, chronic, and acute neuropathy. As used herein the term encompasses
mononeuropathy, multiple mononeuropathy, and polyneuropathy.
[0032]    Illustrative causes of neuropathy include, but are not limited to, neuropathy caused
by, resulting from, or associated with diabetes, chemotherapy, trauma, malnutrition,
alcoholism, autoimmune diseases, cancer, infectious diseases, kidney disease, liver disease,
HIV, AIDS, hypothyroidism, hereditary disorders, and exposure to toxins.
[0033]    In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides compositions for the
treatment or prevention of peripheral neuropathy or the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.
In some embodiments, the peripheral neuropathy is drug-induced peripheral neuropathy. In
some embodiments, the peripheral neuropathy is induced by a chemotherapeutic agent. In
some embodiments, the chemotherapeutic agent is a vinca alkaloid. In some embodiments,
the vinca alkaloid is vincristine. In some embodiments, the symptoms of peripheral
neuropathy include hyperalgesia.
[0034]    As used herein, "hyperalgesia" refers to an increased sensitivity to pain, which may
be caused by damage to nociceptors or peripheral nerves (i.e. neuropathy). The term refers to
temporary and permanent hyperalgesia, and encompasses both primary hyperalgesia (i.e. pain
sensitivity occurring directly in damaged tissues) and secondary hyperalgesia (i.e. pain
sensitivity occurring in undamaged tissues surrounding damaged tissues). The term
encompasses hyperalgesia caused by, but not limited to, neuropathy caused by, resulting
from, or otherwise associated with genetic disorders, metabolic/endocrine complications,

alcohol, organic metal, heavy metal, radiation, and drug toxicity. In some embodiments
hyperalgesia is caused by drug-induced peripheral neuropathy.
[0035]    In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides compositions for the
treatment or prevention of hyperalgesia. In some embodiments, the hyperalgesia is drug
induced. In some embodiments, the hyperalgesia is induced by a chemotherapeutic agent. In
some embodiments, the chemotherapeutic agent is a vinca alkaloid. In some embodiments,
the vinca alkaloid is vincristine.
[0036]    As used herein, the terms "polypeptide," "peptide," and "protein" are used
interchangeably herein to mean a polymer comprising two or more amino acids joined to
each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds, i.e., peptide isosteres. Polypeptide
refers to both short chains, commonly referred to as peptides, glycopeptides or oligomers, and
to longer chains, generally referred to as proteins. Polypeptides may contain amino acids
other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. Polypeptides include amino acid sequences
modified either by natural processes, such as post-translational processing, or by chemical
modification techniques that are well known in the art. Such modifications are well
described in basic texts, as well as in a voluminous research literature.
[0037]    As used herein, "prevention" or "preventing" of a disorder or condition with
reference to a treatment method (e.g., administration of a compound, such as an aromatic
cationic peptide of the present disclosure), means that the method reduces the occurrence of
the disorder or condition in treated subjects relative to an untreated control subjects.
[0038]    As used herein, the words "protect" or "protecting" refer to decreasing the
likelihood and/or risk that the subject treated with a peptide of the present technology will
develop a given disease or disorder, or delaying the onset or reducing the severity of one or
more symptoms of the disease, disorder or condition, e.g., a neuropathy or associated
conditions or complications such as hyperalgesia. Typically, the likelihood of developing the
disease or disorder is considered to be reduced if the likelihood is decreased by at least about
10%, at least about 25%, at least about 50%, at least about 75%, at least about 90%, in
comparison to the likelihood and/or risk that the same subject untreated with a peptide of the
present technology will develop a neuropathy or a hyperalgesia. In some embodiments, the
peptides protect a subject against the development of a neuropathy or a hyperalgesia when the

peptides are administered after a subject receives a neuropathy-inducing drug, but before the
onset of neuropathy or hyperalgesia.
[0039]    The term "subject" as used herein refers to a member of any vertebrate species. The
methods of the presently disclosed subject matter are particularly useful for warm-blooded
vertebrates. Provided herein is the treatment of mammals such as humans, as well as those
mammals of importance due to being endangered, of economic importance (animals raised on
farms for consumption by humans) and/or social importance (animals kept as pets or in zoos)
to humans. In some embodiments, the subject is a human.
[0040]    As used herein, the terms "treating," "treatment," or "alleviation" refer to both
therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to
prevent or slow down (lessen) the targeted pathologic condition or disorder. A subject is
successfully "treated" for a disease or condition if, after receiving a therapeutic amount of the
aromatic-cationic peptides according to the methods described herein, the subject shows
observable and/or measurable reduction in or absence of one or more signs and symptoms of
a particular disease or condition. For example, for a neuropathy or a hyperalgesia, treatment
or prevention may include a reduction frequency, severity, or duration of symptoms, such as
pain in the extremities. It is also to be appreciated that the various modes of treatment or
prevention of medical conditions as described are intended to mean "substantial", which
includes total but also less than total treatment or prevention, and wherein some biologically
or medically relevant result is achieved.
Peptides
[0041]    The aromatic-cationic peptides useful in the present methods are water-soluble and
highly polar. Despite these properties, the peptides can readily penetrate cell membranes.
The aromatic-cationic peptides useful in the present methods include a minimum of three
amino acids, and preferably include a minimum of four amino acids, covalently joined by
peptide bonds. The maximum number of amino acids present in the aromatic-cationic
peptides of the present methods is about twenty amino acids covalently joined by peptide
bonds. In some embodiments, the maximum number of amino acids is about twelve, about
nine, or about six. In some embodiments, the number of amino acids present in the peptides
is four.

    WO 2013/149172                                                           PCT/US2013/034647
[0042]     The amino acids of the aromatic-cationic peptides can be any amino acid. The
amino acids may be naturally occurring. Naturally occurring amino acids include, for
example, the twenty most common levorotatory (L) amino acids normally found in
mammalian proteins, i.e., alanine (Ala), arginine (Arg), asparagine (Asn), aspartic acid (Asp),
cysteine (Cys), glutamine (Glu), glutamic acid (Glu), glycine (Gly), histidine (His),
isoleucine (Ileu), leucine (Leu), lysine (Lys), methionine (Met), phenylalanine (Phe), proline
(Pro), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), tryptophan, (Trp), tyrosine (Tyr), and valine (Val). Other
naturally occurring amino acids include, for example, amino acids that are synthesized in
metabolic processes not associated with protein synthesis. For example, the amino acids
ornithine and citrulline are synthesized in mammalian metabolism during the production of
urea.
[0043]     The peptides can optionally contain one or more non-naturally occurring amino
acids. The non-naturally occurring amino acids may be L-, dextrorotatory (D), or mixtures
thereof. The peptide may have no amino acids that are naturally occurring. Non-naturally
occurring amino acids are those amino acids that typically are not synthesized in normal
metabolic processes in living organisms, and do not naturally occur in proteins. In addition,
the non-naturally occurring amino acids are not recognized by common proteases.
[0044]     The non-naturally occurring amino acid can be present at any position in the
peptide. For example, the non-naturally occurring amino acid can be at the N-terminus, the
C-terminus, or at any position between the N-terminus and the C-terminus. The non-natural
amino acids may, for example, comprise alkyl, aryl, or alkylaryl groups. Some examples of
alkyl amino acids include a-aminobutyric acid, 0-aminobutyric acid, y-aminobutyric acid, 6
aminovaleric acid, and r-aminocaproic acid. Some examples of aryl amino acids include
ortho-, meta, and para-aminobenzoic acid. Some examples of alkylaryl amino acids include
ortho-, meta-, and para-aminophenylacetic acid, and y-phenyl-o-aminobutyric acid. Non
naturally occurring amino acids also include derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids.
The derivatives of naturally occurring amino acids may, for example, include the addition of
one or more chemical groups to the naturally occurring amino acid.
[0045]     For example, one or more chemical groups can be added to one or more of the 2', 3',
4', 5', or 6' position of the aromatic ring of a phenylalanine or tyrosine residue, or the 4', 5',
6', or 7' position of the benzo ring of a tryptophan residue. The group can be any chemical
                                                  12

    WO 2013/149172                                                           PCT/US2013/034647
group that can be added to an aromatic ring. Some examples of such groups include
branched or unbranched C 1-C4 alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, butyl,
isobutyl, or t-butyl, CI-C 4 alkyloxy (i.e., alkoxy), amino, CI-C 4 alkylamino and CI-C  4
dialkylamino (e.g., methylamino, dimethylamino), nitro, hydroxyl, halo (i.e., fluoro, chloro,
bromo, or iodo). Some specific examples of non-naturally occurring derivatives of naturally
occurring amino acids include norvaline (Nva), norleucine (Nle), and hydroxyproline (Hyp).
[0046]    Another example of a modification of an amino acid is the derivatization of a
carboxyl group of an aspartic acid or a glutamic acid residue of the peptide. One example of
derivatization is amidation with ammonia or with a primary or secondary amine, e.g.,
methylamine, ethylamine, dimethylamine or diethylamine. Another example of
derivatization includes esterification with, for example, methyl or ethyl alcohol. Another
such modification includes derivatization of an amino group of a lysine, arginine, or histidine
residue. For example, such amino groups can be acylated. Some suitable acyl groups
include, for example, a benzoyl group or an alkanoyl group comprising any of the CI-C 4 alkyl
groups mentioned above, such as an acetyl or propionyl group.
[0047]    The non-naturally occurring amino acids are suitably resistant, and in some
embodiments, insensitive, to common proteases. Examples of non-naturally occurring amino
acids that are resistant or insensitive to proteases include the dextrorotatory (D-) form of any
of the above-mentioned naturally occurring L-amino acids, as well as L- and/or D- non
naturally occurring amino acids. The D-amino acids do not normally occur in proteins,
although they are found in certain peptide antibiotics that are synthesized by means other than
the normal ribosomal protein synthetic machinery of the cell. As used herein, the D-amino
acids are considered to be non-naturally occurring amino acids.
[0048]    In order to minimize protease sensitivity, the peptides may have less than five, less
than four, less than three, less than two contiguous L-amino acids recognized by common
proteases, irrespective of whether the amino acids are naturally or non-naturally occurring. If
the peptide contains protease sensitive sequences of amino acids, at least one of the amino
acids may be a non-naturally-occurring D-amino acid, thereby conferring protease resistance.
An example of a protease sensitive sequence includes two or more contiguous basic amino
acids that are readily cleaved by common proteases, such as endopeptidases and trypsin.
Examples of basic amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine.

[0049]     In suitable embodiments, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a minimum number of
net positive charges at physiological pH in comparison to the total number of amino acid
residues in the peptide. The minimum number of net positive charges at physiological pH
will be referred to below as (pm). The total number of amino acid residues in the peptide will
be referred to below as (r). The minimum number of net positive charges discussed below
are all at physiological pH. The term "physiological pH" as used herein refers to the normal
pH in the cells of the tissues and organs of the mammalian body. For instance, the
physiological pH of a human is normally approximately 7.4, but normal physiological pH in
mammals may be any pH from about 7.0 to about 7.8.
[0050]     "Net charge" as used herein refers to the balance of the number of positive charges
and the number of negative charges carried by the amino acids present in the peptide. In this
specification, it is understood that net charges are measured at physiological pH. The
naturally occurring amino acids that are positively charged at physiological pH include L
lysine, L-arginine, and L-histidine. The naturally occurring amino acids that are negatively
charged at physiological pH include L-aspartic acid and L-glutamic acid. Typically, a
peptide has a positively charged N-terminal amino group and a negatively charged C-terminal
carboxyl group. The charges cancel each other out at physiological pH.
[0051]     In one embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a relationship between the
minimum number of net positive charges at physiological pH (pm) and the total number of
amino acid residues (r) wherein 3 pm is the largest number that is less than or equal to r + 1.
In this embodiment, the relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges
(pm) and the total number of amino acid residues (r) is as follows:

[0052]     In another embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a relationship between
the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and the total number of amino acid

embodiment, the relationship between the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and
the total number of amino acid residues (r) is as follows:

[0053]      In one embodiment, the minimum number of net positive charges (pm) and the total
number of amino acid residues (r) are equal. In another embodiment, the peptides have three
or four amino acid residues and a minimum of one net positive charge, preferably, a
minimum of two net positive charges and more preferably a minimum of three net positive
charges. In suitable embodiments, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a minimum number of
aromatic groups in comparison to the total number of net positive charges (pt). The minimum
number of aromatic groups will be referred to below as (a).
[0054]      Naturally occurring amino acids that have an aromatic group include the amino
acids histidine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. For example, the hexapeptide Lys
Gln-Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Trp has a net positive charge of two (contributed by the lysine and
arginine residues) and three aromatic groups (contributed by tyrosine, phenylalanine and
tryptophan residues).
[0055]      In one embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptides have a relationship between the
minimum number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of net positive charges at
physiological pH (pt) wherein 3a is the largest number that is less than or equal to pt + 1,
except that when pt is 1, a may also be 1. In this embodiment, the relationship between the
minimum number of aromatic groups (a) and the total number of net positive charges (pt) is

[0058]    Carboxyl groups, especially the terminal carboxyl group of a C-terminal amino acid,
may be amidated with, for example, ammonia to form the C-terminal amide. Alternatively,
the terminal carboxyl group of the C-terminal amino acid may be amidated with any primary
or secondary amine. The primary or secondary amine may, for example, be an alkyl,
especially a branched or unbranched C1-C 4 alkyl, or an aryl amine. Accordingly, the amino
acid at the C-terminus of the peptide may be converted to an amido, N-methylamido, N
ethylamido, N,N-dimethylamido, N,N-diethylamido, N-methyl-N-ethylamido, N
phenylamido or N-phenyl-N-ethylamido group.
[0059]    The free carboxylate groups of the asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid, and
glutamic acid residues not occurring at the C-terminus of the aromatic-cationic peptides of
the present technology may also be amidated wherever they occur within the peptide. The
amidation at these internal positions may be with ammonia or any of the primary or
secondary amines described above.
[0060]    In one embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptide is a tripeptide having two net
positive charges and at least one aromatic amino acid. In a particular embodiment, the
aromatic-cationic peptide is a tripeptide having two net positive charges and two aromatic
amino acids.

[0062]     In some embodiments, peptides are those peptides which have a tyrosine residue or
a tyrosine derivative. Suitable derivatives of tyrosine include 2'-methyltyrosine (Mmt); 2',6'
dimethyltyrosine (2'6'Dmt); 3',5'-dimethyltyrosine (3'5'Dmt); N,2',6'-trimethyltyrosine
(Tmt); and 2'-hydroxy-6'-methyltryosine (Hmt).
[0063]     In one embodiment, the peptide has the formula Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 . Tyr-D
Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 has a net positive charge of three, contributed by the amino acids tyrosine,
arginine, and lysine and has two aromatic groups contributed by the amino acids
phenylalanine and tyrosine. The tyrosine of Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 can be a modified
derivative of tyrosine such as in 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine to produce the compound having the
formula 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2.
[0064]     In a suitable embodiment, the amino acid residue at the N-terminus is arginine. An
example of such a peptide is D-Arg-2'6'Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 . In another embodiment, the
amino acid at the N-terminus is phenylalanine or its derivative. Derivatives of phenylalanine
include 2'-methylphenylalanine (Mmp), 2',6'-dimethylphenylalanine (Dmp), N,2',6'
trimethylphenylalanine (Tmp), and 2'-hydroxy-6'-methylphenylalanine (Hmp). An example
of such a peptide is Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 . In one embodiment, the amino acid sequence
of 2',6'-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2 is rearranged such that Dmt is not at the N-terminus. An
example of such an aromatic-cationic peptide has the formula D-Arg-2'6'Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH 2 .
[0065]     In yet another embodiment, the aromatic-cationic peptide has the formula Phe-D
Arg-Dmt-Lys-NH 2. Alternatively, the N-terminal phenylalanine can be a derivative of
phenylalanine such as 2',6'-dimethylphenylalanine (2'6'Dmp). Tyr-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH 2
containing 2',6'-dimethylphenylalanine at amino acid position one has the formula 2',6'-Dmp
D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-NH 2 .
[0066]     Suitable substitution variants of the peptides include conservative amino acid
substitutions. Amino acids may be grouped according to their physicochemical
characteristics as follows:

[0067]     Substitutions of an amino acid in a peptide by another amino acid in the same group
is referred to as a conservative substitution and may preserve the physicochemical
characteristics of the original peptide. In contrast, substitutions of an amino acid in a peptide
by another amino acid in a different group are generally more likely to alter the
characteristics of the original peptide. Examples of peptides include, but are not limited to,
the aromatic-cationic peptides shown in Table 5.

Neuropathy and Hyperalgesia
[0071]    The aromatic-cationic peptides described herein are useful in treating or preventing
neuropathy or hyperalgesia. In some embodiments, the aromatic-cationic peptides may be
administered to a subject following the onset of neuropathy or hyperalgesia. Thus, the term
"treatment" is used herein in its broadest sense and refers to use of an aromatic-cationic
peptide for a partial or complete cure of the neuropathy or hyperalgesia, a reduction or
amelioration of signs or symptoms, and/or a reduction of severity of signs or symptoms .
[0072]    In other embodiments, the aromatic-cationic peptides of the present technology may
be administered to a subject before the onset of neuropathy or hyperalgesia in order to
prevent, protect against and/or provide prophylaxis for neuropathy or hyperalgesia. It is also
contemplated that the compounds may be administered to a subject at risk of developing
neuropathy or hyperalgesia.
[0073]    The term "peripheral neuropathy" refers generally to damage to nerves of the
peripheral nervous system. The term encompasses neuropathy of various etiologies,
including, but not limited to, acquired neuropathies, hereditary neuropathies, and idiopathic
neuropathies. Illustrative acquired neuropathies include, but are not limited to, e.g.,
neuropathies caused by, resulting from, or otherwise associated with trauma,
metabolic/endocrine disorders (e.g., diabetes), inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases,
vitamin deficiencies, malignant diseases, and toxicity, such as alcohol, organic metal, heavy
metal, radiation, and drug toxicity. As used herein, the "peripheral neuropathy" encompasses
motor, sensory, mixed sensorimotor, chronic, and acute neuropathy. As used herein the term
encompasses mononeuropathy, multiple mononeuropathy, and polyneuropathy.
[0074]    Illustrative causes of neuropathy include, but are not limited to, neuropathy caused
by, resulting from, or associated with diabetes, chemotherapy, trauma, malnutrition,
alcoholism, autoimmune diseases, cancer, infectious diseases, kidney disease, liver disease,
HIV, AIDS, hypothyroidism, hereditary disorders, and exposure to toxins.
[0075]    Drug toxicity causes multiple forms of peripheral neuropathy, with the most
common being axonal degeneration. A notable exception is that of perhexiline, a
prophylactic anti-anginal agent that can cause segmental demyelination, a localized
degeneration of the insulating layer around some nerves.

    WO 2013/149172                                                           PCT/US2013/034647
[0076]    Peripheral neuropathies usually present sensory symptoms initially, and often
progress to motor disorders. Most drug-induced peripheral neuropathies are purely sensory
or mixed sensorimotor defects. An exception is that of Dapzone, which causes an almost
exclusively motor neuropathy.
[0077]    Drug-induced peripheral neuropathy, including, for example, chemotherapy-induced
peripheral neuropathy can cause a variety of dose-limiting neuropathic conditions, including
1) myalgias, 2) painful burning paresthesis, 3) glove-and-stocking sensory neuropathy, and 4)
hyperalgia and allodynia. Hyperalgia refers to hypersensitivity and pain caused by stimuli
that is normally only mildly painful or irritating. Allodynia refers to hypersensitivity and
pain caused by stimuli that is normally not painful or irritating.
[0078]    The term "hyperalgesia" refers to an increased sensitivity to pain, which may be
caused by damage to nociceptors or peripheral nerves (i.e. neuropathy). The term refers to
temporary and permanent hyperalgesia, and encompasses both primary hyperalgesia (i.e. pain
sensitivity occurring directly in damaged tissues) and secondary hyperalgesia (i.e. pain
sensitivity occurring in undamaged tissues surrounding damaged tissues). The term
encompasses hyperalgesia caused by peripheral neuropathy, including, but not limited to,
neuropathy caused by, resulting from, or associated with genetic disorders,
metabolic/endocrine complications, inflammatory diseases, vitamin deficiencies, malignant
diseases, and toxicity, such as alcohol, organic metal, heavy metal, radiation, and drug
toxicity. In some embodiments hyperalgesia is caused by drug-induced peripheral
neuropathy.
[0079]    In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides compositions for the
treatment or prevention of hyperalgesia. In some embodiments, the hyperalgesia is drug
induced. In some embodiments, the hyperalgesia is induced by a chemotherapeutic agent. In
some embodiments, the chemotherapeutic agent is a vinca alkaloid. In some embodiments,
the vinca alkaloid is vincristine.
[0080]    A wide variety of pharmaceuticals are known to cause drug-induced neuropathy,
including, but not limited to, e.g., anti-microbials, anti-neoplastic agents, cardiovascular
drugs, hypnotics and psychotropics, anti-rheumatics, and anti-convulsants.

not limited to, e.g., phenelzine, thalidomide, methaqualone, glutethimide, amitriptyline, and
imipramine.
[0085]     Illustrative anti-rheumatics known to cause neuropathy include, but are not limited
to, e.g., gold, indomethacin, colchicine, chloroquine, and phenyl butazone.
[0086]     Illustrative anti-convulsants known to cause neuropathy include, but are not limited
to, e.g., phenytoin.

methysergide, phenytoin, disulfiram, carbutamide, tolbutamide, methimazole, dapsone, and
anti-coagulants.
Methods of Prevention and Treatment
[0088]      General. The aromatic-cationic peptides described herein are useful to prevent,
ameliorate, or treat disease. Specifically, the disclosure provides for methods of treating or
preventing neuropathy or hyperalgesia, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof
an effective amount of an aromatic-cationic peptide. In some embodiments, the peptide is D

   WO 2013/149172                                                          PCT/US2013/034647
Arg-2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH 2. In some embodiments, the neuropathy or
hyperalgesia is drug-induced. In some embodiments, the drug-induced neuropathy or
hyperalgesia is caused by administration of a chemotherapeutic agent. In some embodiments,
the chemotherapeutic agent is a vinca alkaloid. In some embodiments, the vinca alkaloid is
vincristine.
[0089     Determinationof the BiologicalEffect of the Aromatic-CationicPeptide-Based
Therapeutic. In various embodiments, suitable in vitro or in vivo assays are performed to
determine the effect of a specific aromatic-cationic peptide-based therapeutic and whether its
administration is indicated for treatment of neuropathy or hyperalgesia. In various
embodiments, in vitro assays can be performed with representative cells of the type(s)
involved in the subject's disorder, to determine whether a given aromatic-cationic peptide
based therapeutic exerts the desired effect upon the cell type(s). Compounds for use in
therapy can be tested in suitable animal model systems including, but not limited to, rats,
mice, chicken, cows, monkeys, rabbits, and the like, prior to testing in human subjects.
Similarly, for in vivo testing, any of the animal model system known in the art can be used
prior to administration to human subjects. Conditions associated with neuropathy or
hyperalgesia, and the efficacy of aromatic-cationic peptides in preventing or treating such,
can be readily detected, for example, by measuring the sensitivity of animal subjects to pain
stimuli, such as by the methods outlined in Examples 1 and 2 below.
[0090]    ProphylacticMethods. In one aspect, the present technology provides a method for
preventing neuropathy or hyperalgesia in a subject, or symptoms associated with neuropathy
or hyperalgesia comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of an aromatic
cationic peptide such as D-Arg-2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH 2. In some embodiments,
the peptide is administered simultaneous with one or more therapeutic drugs in order to treat
or prevent drug-induced neuropathy or hyperalgesia. In some embodiments, the peptide is
administered prior to one or more therapeutic drugs in order to treat or prevent drug-induced
neuropathy or hyperalgesia. In some embodiments the peptide is administered prior to,
and/or simultaneous with, one or more therapeutic drugs in order to treat or prevent drug
induced neuropathy or hyperalgesia. In some embodiments, the peptide is administered
simultaneous to and/or subsequent to the drug in order to treat or prevent neuropathy or
hyperalgesia. In some embodiments, the peptide is administered subsequent to the
                                               27

    WO 2013/149172                                                            PCT/US2013/034647
administration of one or more therapeutic agents, but prior to the onset of neuropathy or
hyperalgesia or symptoms of neuropathy or hyperalgesia.
[0091]     Subjects at risk for drug-induced neuropathy or hyperalgesia may be identified by
various diagnostic or prognostic methods known in the art. For example, subjects with a
history of drug-induced neuropathy or hyperalgesia, or a family history of neuropathy or
hyperalgesia, may be assessed as being at risk for the development of neuropathy or
hyperalgesia. Additionally or alternatively, subjects administered multiple therapeutic
agents, or administered one or more therapeutic agents for an extended period of time, may
be assessed as being at risk for the development of neuropathy or hyperalgesia.
[0092]     TherapeuticMethods. Another aspect of the technology includes methods of
reducing the symptoms associated with neuropathy or hyperalgesia in a subject for
therapeutic purposes. In therapeutic applications, compositions or medicaments are
administered to a subject suspected of, or already suffering from such a disease in an amount
sufficient to cure, or at least partially arrest, the symptoms of the disease, including its
complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes in development of the disease. As
such, the present technology provides methods of treating an individual afflicted with
neuropathy or hyperalgesia or symptoms associated with neuropathy or hyperalgesia.
[0093]    In one embodiment, administration of an aromatic-cationic peptide such as D-Arg
2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH 2 to a subject exhibiting one or more symptoms of
neuropathy or hyperalgesia will cause an improvement in one or more of those medical
conditions. For instance, a subject may exhibit at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least
about 20%, or at least about 50% improvement in the clinical symptoms of neuropathy or
hyperalgesia compared to the symptoms as assessed prior to administration of the aromatic
cationic peptide. In some embodiments, a subject may exhibit at least about 5%, at least
about 10%, at least about 20%, or at least about 50% reduction in the duration of symptoms
of neuropathy or hyperalgesia. In some embodiments, a subject may exhibit at least about
50%, at least about 10%, at least about 20%, or at least about 50% reduction in the frequency
of symptoms of neuropathy or hyperalgesia. In some embodiments, a subject may exhibit at
least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 20%, or at least about 50% reduction in the
severity of symptoms of neuropathy or hyperalgesia. In some embodiments, the subject may
                                                   28

    WO 2013/149172                                                           PCT/US2013/034647
show improvement in one or more of the duration, frequency, or severity of symptoms of
neuropathy or hyperalgesia.
Combination Therapies
[0094]    The present disclosure contemplates combination therapies comprising the
administration of an aromatic-cationic peptide such as D-Arg-2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe
NH 2 with one or more additional therapeutic regimens. In some embodiments, the additional
therapeutic regimens are directed to the treatment or prevention of neuropathy or
hyperalgesia or symptoms associated with neuropathy or hyperalgesia. In some
embodiments, the additional therapeutic regimens are directed to the treatment or prevention
of diseases or medical conditions unrelated to neuropathy or hyperalgesia. In some
embodiments, the additional therapeutic regimens include regimens directed to the treatment
or prevention of neuropathy or hyperalgesia or symptoms associated with neuropathy or
hyperalgesia, in addition to diseases, medical conditions, or symptoms unrelated to
neuropathy or hyperalgesia or symptoms associated with neuropathy or hyperalgesia. In
some embodiments, the additional therapeutic regimens comprise administration of one or
more drugs, including, but not limited to, anti-microbials, anti-neoplastic agents,
cardiovascular drugs, hypnotics and psychotropics, anti-rheumatics, and anti-convulsants. In
embodiments, the additional therapeutic regimens comprise non-pharmaceutical therapies,
including, but not limited to, dietary and lifestyle management.
Modes of Administration and Effective Dosages
[0095]    Any method known to those in the art for contacting a cell, organ or tissue with a
peptide may be employed. Suitable methods include in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo methods. In
vivo methods typically include the administration of an aromatic-cationic peptide, such as
those described above, to a mammal, such as a human. When used in vivo for therapy, the
aromatic-cationic peptides of the present technology are administered to the subject in
effective amounts (i.e., amounts that have desired therapeutic effect). They will normally be
administered intravenously, orally, subcutaneously, transdermally, intraperitoneally,
intrathecally intramuscularly, intranasally, bucally, sublingually, translingually, or topically.
The dose and dosage regimen will depend upon the severity of neuropathy, the characteristics
of the particular aromatic-cationic peptide used, e.g., its therapeutic index, the subject, and
the subject's history.
                                                29

    WO 2013/149172                                                              PCT/US2013/034647
[0096]     The effective amount may be determined during pre-clinical trials and clinical trials
by methods familiar to physicians and clinicians. An effective amount of a peptide, such as
in a pharmaceutical composition, may be administered to a mammal in need thereof by any of
a number of well-known methods for administering pharmaceutical compounds. The peptide
may be administered systemically or locally.
[0097]     The peptide may be formulated as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term
"pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means a salt prepared from a base or an acid which is
acceptable for administration to a patient, such as a mammal (e.g., salts having acceptable
mammalian safety for a given dosage regime). However, it is understood that the salts are
not required to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as salts of intermediate compounds
that are not intended for administration to a patient. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be
derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases and from
pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids. In addition, when a peptide contains
both a basic moiety, such as an amine, pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety such as a
carboxylic acid or tetrazole, zwitterions may be formed and are included within the term
"salt" as used herein. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic bases include
ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous,
potassium, sodium, and zinc salts, and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically
acceptable organic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including
substituted amines, cyclic amines, naturally-occurring amines and the like, such as arginine,
betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2
diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N
ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine,
isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperadine, polyamine
resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine,
tromethamine and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic acids
include salts of boric, carbonic, hydrohalic (hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydrofluoric or
hydroiodic), nitric, phosphoric, sulfamic and sulfuric acids. Salts derived from
pharmaceutically acceptable organic acids include salts of aliphatic hydroxyl acids (e.g.,
citric, gluconic, glycolic, lactic, lactobionic, malic, and tartaric acids), aliphatic
monocarboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, butyric, formic, propionic and trifluoroacetic acids),
amino acids (e.g., aspartic and glutamic acids), aromatic carboxylic acids (e.g., benzoic, p
                                                 30

    WO 2013/149172                                                            PCT/US2013/034647
chlorobenzoic, diphenylacetic, gentisic, hippuric, and triphenylacetic acids), aromatic
hydroxyl acids (e.g., o-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 1-hydroxynaphthalene-2
carboxylic and 3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acids), ascorbic, dicarboxylic acids (e.g.,
fumaric, maleic, oxalic and succinic acids), glucoronic, mandelic, mucic, nicotinic, orotic,
pamoic, pantothenic, sulfonic acids (e.g., benzenesulfonic, camphosulfonic, edisylic,
ethanesulfonic, isethionic, methanesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, naphthalene- 1,5-disulfonic,
naphthalene-2,6-disulfonic and p-toluenesulfonic acids), xinafoic acid, acetate or
trifluoroacetate, and the like.
[0098]     The aromatic-cationic peptides described herein can be incorporated into
pharmaceutical compositions for administration, singly or in combination, to a subject for the
treatment or prevention of a disorder or medical condition described herein. Such
compositions typically include the active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As
used herein the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes saline, solvents,
dispersion media, coatings, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agents, isotonic and absorption
delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Supplementary
active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.
[0099]     Pharmaceutical compositions are typically formulated to be compatible with its
intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral
(e.g., intravenous, intradermal, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous), oral, inhalation, transdermal
(topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for
parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a
sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols,
glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; anti-bacterial agents such as benzyl
alcohol or methyl parabens; anti-oxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating
agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or
phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH
can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The
parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose
vials made of glass or plastic.
[0100]     Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use can include sterile aqueous
solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous
                                                 31

   WO 2013/149172                                                            PCT/US2013/034647
preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration,
suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor ELTM (BASF,
Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, a composition for
parenteral administration must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy
syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and
must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and
fungi.
[0101]    The aromatic-cationic peptide compositions can include a carrier, which can be a
solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example,
glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable
mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating
such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and
by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by
various anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol,
ascorbic acid, thiomersal, and the like. In many cases, it will be desirable to include isotonic
agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the
composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by
including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum
monostearate or gelatin.
[0102]    Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in
the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients
enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are
prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle, which contains a basic
dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the
case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, typical methods of
preparation include vacuum drying and freeze drying, which can yield a powder of the active
ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution
thereof.
[0103]    Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the
purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with
excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules. Oral
                                                32

    WO 2013/149172                                                          PCT/US2013/034647
compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash.
Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as
part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of
the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline
cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating
agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or
Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or
saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.
[0104]     Systemic administration of a therapeutic compound as described herein can also be
by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration,
penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such
penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal
administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal
administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For
transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels,
or creams as generally known in the art. In one embodiment, transdermal administration may
be performed my iontophoresis.
[0105]     Dosage, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the therapeutic agents can be
determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals,
e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the
dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and
therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50.
Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that
exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that
targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to
other cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.
[0106]     The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in
formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies
preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no
toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed
and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the present
                                                33

technology, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture
assays. A dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma
concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which
achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such
information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in
plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.
[0107]    Typically, an effective amount of the aromatic-cationic peptides, sufficient for
achieving a therapeutic or prophylactic effect, range from about 0.00000 1 mg per kilogram
body weight per day to about 10,000 mg per kilogram body weight per day. In some
embodiments, the dosage ranges are from about 0.0001 mg per kilogram body weight per day
to about 100 mg per kilogram body weight per day. For example, dosages can be 1 mg/kg
body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight every day, every two days or every three days or
within the range of 1-10 mg/kg every week, every two weeks or every three weeks. In one
embodiment, a single dosage of peptide ranges from 0.1-10,000 micrograms per kg body
weight. In one embodiment, aromatic-cationic peptide concentrations in a carrier range from
0.2 to 2000 micrograms per delivered milliliter. An exemplary treatment regime entails
administration once per day or once a week. Thereafter, the patient can be administered a
prophylactic regime.
[0108]    In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of an aromatic-cationic
peptide may be defined as a concentration of peptide at the target tissue of 10-11 to 10-6 molar,
e.g., approximately 10-7 molar. This concentration may be delivered by systemic doses of
0.01 to 100 mg/kg or equivalent dose by body surface area. The schedule of doses would be
optimized to maintain the therapeutic concentration at the target tissue, such as by single
daily or weekly administration, but also including continuous administration (e.g., parenteral
infusion or transdermal application).
[0109]    In some embodiments, the dosage of the aromatic-cationic peptide is provided at a
"low," "mid," or "high" dose level. In one embodiment, the low dose is provided from about
0.001 to about 0.5 mg/kg/h, suitably from about 0.01 to about 0.1 mg/kg/h. In one
embodiment, the mid-dose is provided from about 0.1 to about 1.0 mg/kg/h, suitably from
about 0.1 to about 0.5 mg/kg/h. In one embodiment, the high dose is provided from about 0.5
to about 10 mg/kg/h, suitably from about 0.5 to about 2 mg/kg/h.

[0110]    The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage and
timing required to effectively treat a subject, including, but not limited to, the severity of the
disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and
other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective
amount of the therapeutic compositions described herein can include a single treatment or a
series of treatments.
[0111]    The mammal treated in accordance with the present technology can be any mammal,
including, for example, farm animals, such as sheep, pigs, cows, and horses; pet animals,
such as dogs and cats; laboratory animals, such as rats, mice and rabbits. In a some
embodiments, the mammal is a human.

[0115]    Mechanical nociceptive threshold of paw-withdrawal was measured every two days
using an electronic Von Frey test. Results are shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 as means  SEM.
One-way ANOVA with post-hoc test or t-test were used to assess the statistical significance,
with p<0.05 is considered statistically significant. In FIG. 1, data for subjects receiving
vincristine in the absence of simultaneous D-Arg-2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH        2
(Groups 2, 4, 5) is shown collectively as "Group A."
[0116]    Results - As shown in FIG. 1, subjects administered vincristine for a period of 14
days (Group A) showed a decrease in pain threshold compared to a vehicle-only control
(Group 1). By contrast, the pain threshold of subjects administered D-Arg-2'6'
dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH     2 together with vincristine (Group 3) was not significantly
different from the vehicle-only control. This shows that co-administration of D-Arg-2'6'
dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH     2 together with vincristine prevents vincristine-induced
hyperalgesia in mammalian subjects.
[0117]    As shown in FIG. 2, subjects administered vincristine for a period of 14 days
(Groups 2, 4) showed a decrease in pain threshold response compared to a vehicle-only
control (Group 1). Following the withdrawal of vincristine, subjects not administered D-Arg
2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH 2 continued to show a decline in pain thereshold, reaching
a low point at day 21, and showed a moderate improvement beginning at day 22 (Group 2).
By contrast, subjects administered D-Arg-2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH        2 following the
withdrawal of vincristine showed improved pain threshold as soon as day 15, with continued

improvement through day 25 (Group 4). This shows that administration of D-Arg-2'6'
dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH      2 subsequent to vincristine therapy improves the rate of
recovery of a mammalian subject from vincristine-induced hyperalgesia.
[0118]    As further shown in FIG. 2, subjects administered vincristine in the absence of D
Arg-2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH       2 for a period of 14 days, and then administered
vincristine together with D-Arg-2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH          2 for a period of 14 days,
showed an arrest of the downward trend in pain threshold evident in the initial 14 day period,
followed by an improvement in pain threshold beginning at day 16 (Group 5). This shows
that administration of D-Arg-2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH        2 subsequent to the
development of vincristine-induced hyperalgesia is effective in halting further progression of
the condition and promotes improvement of the condition, even where a subject continues to
receive vincristine.
[0119]    This example shows that aromatic-cationic peptides of the present technology, such
as D-Arg-2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH 2 , are useful in the prevention and treatment of
vincristine-induced hyperalgesia. The results further show that aromatic-cationic peptides of
the present technology, such as D-Arg-2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH            2 are useful in the
prevention and treatment of drug-induced hyperalgesia generally.
Example 2 - Use of D-Arg-2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH          2 in the Treatment of Drug
Induced Hyperalgesia in Humans
[0120]    This example will demonstrate use of the methods and compositions of the present
technology in the treatment of hyperalgesia in human subjects. The example will
demonstrate the use of D-Arg-2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH          2 in the treatment of
vincristine-induced hyperalgesia in humans.
[0121]    Patients will be recruited to the study as they present in clinic with chronic (>6
months' duration), spontaneous, ongoing, vincristine-related pain. Those enrolled will rate
their daily maximum level of pain at 4 or greater on a visual analog scale (VAS). The
patients will be screened for their willingness to enroll in the study, and informed consent
will be obtained. Healthy subjects will also be recruited for collection of comparison data.
No subjects in either the patient or comparison group will have known risk factors for any

previous radiation exposure.
[0122]    After a focused interview about the history of the patient's cancer and treatment, the
patient will be asked to describe sensory symptoms by choosing from a list of ideal type word
descriptors. Ongoing and daily maximum pain intensity will be rated on a VAS with prompts
of "no pain" at the bottom and "most imaginable" at the top. The areas of pain and sensory
disturbances will be drawn by each patient on a standardized body map. Similar to previous
observations in patients treated with paclitaxel, subjects with vincristine-induced peripheral
neuropathy are predicted to identify the following three zones of sensation:
        a) The painful area: The zone of ongoing pain located on the tips of the fingers and/or
        toes. The tip of the index finger is expected to be involved in all patients and will be
        used as the test site in this zone.
        b) The border area: Adjacent and proximal to, but distinct from the painful area,
        represented by nonpainful sensory disturbances and located in the palms and/or soles
        of the feet. The thenar eminence is expected to be involved in all patients and will be
        used as the test site in this zone.
        c) The nonpainful area: Adjacent and proximal to, but distinct from the border area,
        reported by the patient to feel "normal." This site is expected to be always proximal
        to the wrists and/or ankles. Sensory testing will be conducted on the volar surface of
        the arm.
[0123]    The tip of the index finger, thenar eminence, and volar forearm, will be tested in
normal subjects for comparison. Patients will be specifically queried about the stimuli that
provoked pain or caused an exacerbation of ongoing pain in these regions, including the
effects that clothing, bed linens, bathing, and normal activities of daily living cause. Each
zone will be examined for any physical changes, such as scaling, finger clubbing, and
erythema, which will be documented. The areas of sensory disturbance will be physically
probed by light touch with a camel hair brush and by manual massage to screen for the
presence of allodynia or hyperalgesia.

[0124]     Touch and SharpnessDetection Thresholds - Touch detection thresholds will be
determined with von Frey monofilaments using the up/down method as previously reported.
Starting with a bending force of 0.02 g, each monofilament will be applied to a spot on the
skin less than 2 mm in diameter for approximately one second. The force of the filament
detected four consecutive times will be assigned as the touch detection threshold. Sharpness
detection will be determined using weighted 30-gauge metal cylinders. Briefly, the tip of 30
gauge needles (200 mm diameter) will be filed to produce flat, cylindrical ends and the luers
will be fitted to calibrated brass weights with the desired force (100, 200, and 400 mN) level
for each stimulus. Each loaded needle will be placed inside a separate 10 cc syringe where it
will be able to move freely. Each stimulus will be applied for one second perpendicular to
the skin 10 times within each area of interest in a pseudorandom order. The subjects will
indicate whether the stimulus is perceived as touch, pressure, sharp, or other. The
percentages of each reply will be calculated and then combined into group grand means for
comparison. The 50% sharpness detection threshold will be calculated as the weighted
needle that caused five or more sharp responses after 10 consecutive stimuli.
[0125]     Grooved PegboardTest - Manual dexterity will be assessed with the grooved
pegboard test. Subjects will be instructed to fill a five-by-five slotted pegboard in an ordered
fashion and the times for both dominant and non-dominant hands will be recorded.
[0126]     Thermal Detection Thresholds - The threshold for heat pain will be determined
using the Marstock technique. A radiometer will be used at the outset of testing to ascertain
the baseline skin temperature at all testing sites. All tests and measurements will be
conducted at room temperature 22'C. Thermal ramps will be applied using a 3.6 x 3.6 cm
Peltier thermode from a baseline temperature of 32'C. Skin heating will be at a ramp of
0.30'C/s, and skin cooling will be at a ramp of -0.5 0 C/s. Subjects will be instructed to signal
when the stimulus is perceived as first becoming warmer and then painfully hot, or as first
becoming cooler and then painfully cold. If a subject fails to reach a given threshold before
the cutoff temperature of 51.5'C for the ascending ramp or 3C held for 10 seconds in the
cooling test, the cutoff values will be assigned for any that are not reached. The final
threshold value for each skin sensation in each patient will be determined by averaging the
results of three heating and cooling trials.

[0127]    StatisticalAnalysis - The thresholds for touch detection will be compared using
nonparametric methods (Wilcoxon's test). The sharpness detection, thermal thresholds, and
times in the grooved pegboard tests will be compared using analysis of variance and post hoc
comparison of the means with Duncan's multiple range tests. Comparisons of mechanical
and thermal thresholds will be performed between healthy subjects and patients for the
different areas of the tested skin. Further analyses will be performed between glabrous and
volar skin within the patient group. For every comparison performed in the present study, p <
0.05 will be considered significant.
[0128]    Following initial assessment of the above criteria, subjects will be divided into four
groups:
        a) Healthy controls
        b) No treatment
        c) Vehicle-only placebo, administered s.c., once daily for 14 days
        d) D-Arg-2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH 2 at 1-100 mg/kg (e.g., 1 mg/kg, 5 mg,
        kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 70 mg/kg, 80
        mg/kg, 90 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg) administered s.c., once daily for 14 days
[0129]    Following the 14 day treatment period, subjects will be re-assessed according to the
above criteria, with statistical analysis as described above.
[0130]    Results - It is expected that neuropathy subjects administered D-Arg-2'6'
dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH      2 for a period of 14 days will report a reduction in hyperalgesia
symptoms compared to subjects administered no treatment or a vehicle-only placebo. The
reduction in hyperalgesia will be manifest in improved scoring for touch and sharpness
detection thresholds, grooved pegboard tests, and thermal detection tests compared to control
subjects.
[0131]    These results will show that aromatic-cationic peptides of the present technology,
such as D-Arg-2'6'-dimethyltyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH        2 are useful in the treatment of vincristine
induced hyperalgesia, and drug-induced hyperalgesia generally. The results will show that
the methods and compositions described herein are useful in the treatment of drug-induced
peripheral neuropathy or hyperalgesia.
